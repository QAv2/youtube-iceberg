            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Linmo is an extreme athlete who has challenged extreme environments such as the world&#x27;s highest peak, glaciers, and caves throughout his career and has succeeded many times. One day, he was surfing at the beach, racing against a ferocious shark behind him. Suddenly, a wave 2 m high crashed in, and in an instant, Lyno and everything on the shore were swallowed up by the wave. When he woke up again, he rubbed his eyes and found himself floating on a Greystone platform about 6 square meters in size, surrounded by an endless blue ocean. At first, Lyn Mo found it hard to believe, but he quickly slapped himself twice, the pain telling him it was real.</p>
<p>He realized he might have traveled to another world. Just then, a voice rang out. Linmo and all humans aged 18 to 50 worldwide have completed their migration. Each allocated six square meters of island space. The only tool is a fishing rod.</p>
<p>Supplies will be obtained through fishing. Lynn Mo&#x27;s pupils suddenly contracted and he quickly looked down at his side. Sure enough, a simple wooden fishing rod lay there quietly. He realized that he had been transported into a survival game. He also noticed he was wearing a fitness tracker.</p>
<p>He touched the tracker and a light screen instantly appeared. Island level zero talent unawwakened resources none. Status mildly dehydrated hungry. Next, Linmo noticed features such as chat channels, world regional private chat, trading platform, and crafting interface. He opened the chat channels and found many people discussing and complaining.</p>
<p>Then when he switched to the regional channel to check the information, the systems mechanical voice sounded again. Daily check-in system activated. All survivors can check in once per day. Lynn Emmo silently said, &quot;Check in.&quot; And then the system notification appeared. Check-in successful.</p>
<p>Congratulations on receiving 1x 500 ml purified water. 1x 200g white bread 100x amplification system successfully bound. The system also details the talent. The host will receive a 100fold increase in the quantity of resources acquired through any direct means. Note, resources acquired through trade or blueprints/ templates will not be eligible for this increase.</p>
<p>The next second, the water bottle in Lin Mo&#x27;s hand multiplied into a 100 bottles and the bread into 100 pieces. Seeing this, he was overjoyed, but also became alert, guessing that the others might be short of food. He unscrewed a bottle of water, drank a third of it, and cleared his head. He then broke off a piece of bread and ate it, regaining some strength before starting to organize his thoughts. Lyn Mo quickly analyzed the rules.</p>
<p>Only resources obtained directly would enjoy a 100x increase, which meant he had to personally sign in and do the work. He quickly devised a plan. He opened the trading platform and found that no one was selling food. So he anonymously posted a sale notice selling 50 ml of pure water requirements. Would X5 or palm leaves X10 or stone X3? Feeling that he hadn&#x27;t sold enough items, Lynn Mo chose to sell more.</p>
<p>For sale 50g of white bread, about a quarter of a loaf needs 20 fibers or one rope or one metal sheet. The transaction was completed quickly after seeing Lin Mo selling water on the regional channel. Many people commented and even praised him as a good person. But Lynn Mo knew in his heart that he was just doing business. After acquiring the supplies, Lynn Mo decided to try fishing.</p>
<p>He picked up his fishing rod and cast it into the water. 10 minutes later, he caught a wooden crate. Inside the crate were two foundation stones, one rope, and one rough island expansion blueprint. onetime use. The system prompted Linmo that he could increase the number of wooden crates he had obtained to 100.</p>
<p>Then 100 wooden crates fell onto the island. Linmo opened some of the crates and began to think about how to build a shelter. As the sea breeze grew cooler, Lin Mo knew he had to find a place to stay for the night. So, he built a simple thatched hut using wood and palm leaves and laid out dried palm leaves as a mattress inside. Although the shelter was very simple, Lin Moe&#x27;s life was already considered luxurious compared to other players.</p>
<p>Now, Lynn Mo possesses 99 bottles of water, 99 loaves of bread, nearly 100 unopened supply boxes, and a pile of basic materials. The anonymous merchant, Mr. J, is officially born. As dawn broke, Lynn Emmo woke up in a Thatch hut. He first unscrewed a bottle of water and took a couple of sips, then broke off a piece of bread and chewed it slowly.</p>
<p>Next, he checked in and received 100g of compressed biscuits and 10 iron nails. He opted for a 100x multiplier, and immediately the original one bag of military grade compressed biscuits became 100 bags and a,000 rusty nails piled up in the corner. Next, he decided to accumulate raw resources through trading. Linmo entered the trading platform and found that the prices of food and water were becoming increasingly outrageous. He noticed that foundation stones appeared very infrequently.</p>
<p>So, he began to study how to obtain more foundation stones. A message caught his attention. Upgrading the island to LV1 requires 10 foundation stones, 20 wood, and 15 stones. The top 10 upgraders across the server will receive additional rewards. Lynmo felt both excited and wary.</p>
<p>Lynn and Mo decided to gather enough materials for the upgrade. So, he opened 10 wooden crates. Once he had enough materials, he decided to stop temporarily and take advantage of the information and resource gaps to complete the first round of harvesting. He started placing orders on the trading platform, offering to buy basic materials that he didn&#x27;t really need, but that other players might desperately need at low prices, promising immediate payment. He also posted several sales listings.</p>
<p>For sale, 300 ml of purified water in exchange for two bay stones or one complete fishing rod or special blueprints. For sale, 200g of white bread in exchange for five metal materials or tool blueprints. Lynn Mo used water and bread, which cost almost nothing to acquire a large amount of basic materials at low prices and then used higher prices to acquire precious resources. thus quickly completing the acquisition. A few minutes later, Lynmo&#x27;s inventory underwent a dramatic change.</p>
<p>About oneif of his food and water had been consumed, but in return, he had a mountain of materials such as wood, stone, and fiber. People on the regional channel gradually became aware of Lin Moe&#x27;s trading methods, and some criticized him as a shrewd businessman, but Lynn Mo didn&#x27;t care at all. Just 5 minutes later, he fished up another wooden supply crate. Upon opening it, he obtained four foundation stones, eight pieces of wood, two complete glass bottles, and one simple water purifier blueprint. One-time use.</p>
<p>Lynmo looked at the water purifier blueprints when the system notification sounded again. Triggered 100x amplification. Amplify. He chose to amplify without hesitation and then received 100 wooden boxes. He didn&#x27;t open them all, but opened 21st, obtaining a rough arrow crafting template.</p>
<p>a template. Limo&#x27;s eyes lit up because templates could be crafted infinitely. He roughly estimated that he had enough foundation stones to upgrade several levels and could start preparing for the upgrade. Lynmo looked at the edge of the island, thinking to himself, &quot;But he must upgrade only after ensuring safety.&quot; Lynmo then opened the trading platform. He began using his abundant wood and stone to exchange for scarcer resources such as metal ingots.</p>
<p>Gradually, people started calling him a profiteer. Lynn Mo silently calculated his resources and planned his next move. At noon, he continued fishing. He caught a wooden box and obtained rough animal hide X1, Flynn X2, and unknown metal fragment X3. In the afternoon, Lynn Mo changed a strategy.</p>
<p>He started listing some non-essential but tempting items for sale. For example, he would exchange 50g of bread for a piece of information or intelligence. Want to test the value of information in this world. Soon, trade requests poured in. Someone traded 50g of bread for schools of bioluminescent fish in a nearby waters at night.</p>
<p>Another traded 100 ml of water for a sea shell with strange symbols engraved on it. Suddenly, a mysterious private message caught Linmo&#x27;s attention. He opened the message and found that the sender&#x27;s ID was no at all and the sender&#x27;s asking price was 10 loaves of bread. Lyno thought for a moment and replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll pay two loaves of bread as a deposit first.&quot; After the transaction was completed, Linmo received a coordinate with the following note. I personally witnessed someone fishing up a locked box in this area.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo noted down the coordinate. He closed his private messages and instead checked the island upgrade requirements on his bracelet. He already had more than enough materials. Lynn Mo tallied up his day&#x27;s gains. Most of his food and water were still there, and basic materials were piled up like a mountain.</p>
<p>Standing on the edge of the island, Lynn Emmo found the allure of being the first in the entire server to level up particularly tempting. He began to consider whether he should continue developing his character or first claim the system reward. After much deliberation, Linmo had made up his mind. He decided to choose the most opportune moment. Back under the thatched hut, he lit a small campfire.</p>
<p>The fire light dispelled the chill and illuminated his calm, deep eyes. In a regional chat, some people form alliances by sharing a piece of bread, while others become bitter enemies over a half- empty bottle of water caught by fish. This world is rapidly evolving into a multifaceted place. After dinner, Lynn and Mo added firewood to the campfire and then picked up his fishing rod. In the night, the fluorescent glow on the float twinkled and his arrow was quietly dawning.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, Linmo was awakened by the sound of heavy rain. He crawled out of Thatch hut and found the sky overcast and the air pressure so low it made him feel suffocated. He knew the weather had changed, so he began signing in. Soon the systems voice sounded. Acquired windproof tarpolin x1 tough hemp rope x2.</p>
<p>Then Lynn Mo&#x27;s bracelet announced a storm will descend upon areas numbered SH 700 to SH 800 in 24 hours. Lynn Mo was instantly a buzz when he saw the regional channel. He knew a business opportunity had arrived. After 2 days of accumulation, he possessed a large quantity of building materials as well as 100 pieces of windproof tarpollen and animal hides. He quickly began to consider how to integrate these resources.</p>
<p>This time, Lyn Mo chose to put up a sell order first. He received a large number of transaction requests, and while processing them, he habitually checked the other party&#x27;s ID to distinguish between the vulnerable and the malicious. Lynn Mo&#x27;s attitude towards these two groups was completely different. This round of transactions brought him a large amount of valuable foundation stones, metals, and several decent blueprints, including a simple rainwater collector template. For Lyn Mo, this transaction was a huge success.</p>
<p>At this moment, a private message caught Lin Mo&#x27;s attention. He checked the user ID and found that the sender was named Sue Chian. Linmo remembered that this person had professional marine knowledge and had saved many people. So, he carefully read the message and replied to the sender. Such an I need a piece of waterproof material for a 4 square meter shed.</p>
<p>She exchanged it for a simple herbal drying rack template and added a sentence. This storm may come early and its intensity may be higher than the system forecast. Linmo add another specific criterion for judgment. Su Chian, I saw seagulls flying toward the shore and I also observe long waves. Long waves are a sign of an approaching storm.</p>
<p>The deal was quickly struck and Su Chanhan sent another message. Thank you. Also, you said a high price, but the transaction was straightforward. Lynn Mo replied, &quot;I&#x27;m just a businessman.&quot; And then into the chat. Lyn Mo continued his work.</p>
<p>As time went on, prices soared further while the materials he had accumulated didn&#x27;t decrease. In fact, they increased. At this point, he decided to execute the second step of his plan. He created a new anonymous account and posted a new buy order. At this time, many people were quickly selling off their basic materials in order to exchange for waterproof cloth or upgrade their islands.</p>
<p>Lynmo, on the other hand, bought low and sold high, collecting these materials that were being sold off. Lynmo&#x27;s total supply of basic materials not only didn&#x27;t decrease, but actually increased. Meanwhile, the valuable hard currency began to draw more criticism with many accusing him of being a profiteer. After completing a transaction, Lin Moe&#x27;s bracelet vibrated and the system reminded him that he could upgrade his island and that someone had already upgraded yesterday. He wasn&#x27;t surprised, but he didn&#x27;t choose to upgrade.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo planned to upgrade the island before or after the storm, which would divert everyone&#x27;s attention. The newly upgraded island might be more vulnerable to the storm. So, he decided to postpone the upgrade. He began to reinforce his island himself. He secured the tarpollen to the thatched hot frame with ropes and did other necessary work.</p>
<p>After finishing, he boiled water and enjoyed dinner. After finishing dinner, Lynn Emmo looked out at the sea, lamenting that his reputation as a cunning businessman was now firmly established. His true test and opportunity, however, would arrive after the storm. The prelude to the storm intensified abruptly at midnight. The wind began to howl, but Lynn Mo remained awake.</p>
<p>Wrapped in an animal skin, he sat at the innermost edge of the thatched hut, his eyes glued to the chat channel. Lynn Emmo suddenly remembered that Sue Chanchian&#x27;s judgment was correct. The storm had come early, but the Tempest still couldn&#x27;t shake his island and sturdy cabin. He checked the competition leaderboard and found that the second and third place winners had almost collected enough upgrade materials. A glint flashed in Linmo&#x27;s eyes, and he decided to upgrade his island.</p>
<p>At this moment, he chose to upgrade anonymously, and instantly the bracelet shone brightly. The 10 foundation stones, 20 pieces of wood, and 15 stones piled in the corner flew to the edge of the island. And after the island shook violently, the upgrade was successful. System notification: island has reached LV1 10 m. Gained buff.</p>
<p>Basic stability slightly increases the island stability in severe weather. Serverwide announcement coming soon. Lynn Emo typed a letter J. The announcement quickly rang out. Congratulations to Survivor J for becoming the first person globally to upgrade their island to LV1.</p>
<p>Rewards refined fishing ground beginner X1 Keystone X50 pure water 500 ml X10 white bread 200g X10. Subsequently, Lynn Emmo activated the 100x multiplier effect, gaining 100 times the resources. After the initial shock, he stored the resources back in the system warehouse. As for those who upgraded first and didn&#x27;t receive the system reward, it&#x27;s because they chose to remain completely anonymous. While Lin Mo used the name Jay to upgrade publicly, which is why he received the reward.</p>
<p>Lin Mo saw various jealous and attacking voices in the chat channel, but he didn&#x27;t care. He took out the fish farm template, examined it, and began to consider whether to build it. After some thought, Lynn Mo realized that building a fish farm would not only provide a food source, but also bring in a large number of fish through a 100fold increase in yield. Taking all factors into consideration, he decided to begin construction at a suitable time. Amidst the raging storm at sea, Lynn Emmo leaned against the bedside, watching the changes on the leaderboard with a calm and composed mind.</p>
<p>for only those who upgraded their island for the first time could receive the huge reward. As the storm continued to rage, Linmo pondered how to leverage his number one status and the newly acquired fishing ground template to tap into more resources and rapidly develop the business after the storm subsided. The name J will henceforth become the target of countless people&#x27;s speculation, fear, and yearning to emulate. And what Lyno wants to do is make this target unattainable. The storm gradually subsided in the early morning hours when the first pale rays of dawn pierced the leaden clouds and illuminated the ravaged sea.</p>
<p>Even one island was missing. He checked the chat channel and found that everyone was buying supplies, but Linmo remained unmoved. He knew that the important thing now was to check his own situation first. Lynmo checked the bracelet, storage space, thatch hut, and supplies. After confirming everything was all right, he began to eat bread and drink water to conserve his strength.</p>
<p>Only by staying in good condition could he do more. Next, he began to methodically clear away the debris on the island, collecting usable pieces of wood and buoys. He planned to sell these supplies in exchange for some resources. When he opened the trading platform, he found that the prices of all items had skyrocketed to outrageous levels. Not wanting to draw too much attention, he decided to sell his supplies in a different way.</p>
<p>Being high-profile wasn&#x27;t a good option at this point. So, Lin Mo posted a thread titled some personal experiences on storm reinforcement and post- disaster emergency handling under the pseudonym an anonymous person who luckily survived the storm. Lynmo&#x27;s post was concise and to the point, packed with essential information. He even included a diagram at the end illustrating the construction of the rainwater boiling device. Soon, a flood of replies poured in.</p>
<p>Several valuable private messages caught Lin Mo&#x27;s attention. Su Chanchian asked him if he was interested in exchanging weather information. The Dragon Soul Squad expressed their desire to establish a communication channel with him, and Wings of Freedom expressed their desire to purchase anti-inflammatory herbs. Lynmo replied to Sue Chanchan first. We can exchange.</p>
<p>I need the wind direction and wave change forecast for the SH 739 area for the next 48 hours. I can provide a traditional remedy for quick heistasis using common seaweed. Then Lenmo replied to Dragon Soul Steel Gun. Thank you for your recognition. Information can be shared to a limited extent.</p>
<p>I need to know if the systems weather forecast has any patterns and if there is any other information related to achieving first place. Finally, Lynmo did not reply directly to Wings of Freedom, but instead posted a sale notice on his alternate account for sale core Essentials for Survival and Reconstruction after the storm price two X anti-inflammatory herbs any type. After the listing was posted, the comment section was once again filled with attacks and sarcasm directed at Lyn Mo, but he didn&#x27;t care at all. Soon after, Lynn Mo saw numerous transaction requests. The first transaction was for a rough stone carding blueprint.</p>
<p>Following the first transaction, a second one followed immediately. This transaction yielded Lynn Emmo a small pile of scattered metal, a few blueprint templates, and several actual herbs. Combined with the recipe Sue Chanchian was about to exchange, he could attempt to make medicine. Subsequently, Lin Mo used the same anonymous account that had previously posted the knowledge listing to post a new transaction. He sold reinforced waterproof tarpollen and ultra tough composite rope at a 20% increase in price compared to what he sold before the storm.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lynn Mo began to slowly release the large amount of basic materials, timber, stone, fiber. He had previously stockpiled at prices slightly higher than the current market price, but still far lower than the prices he paid when he acquired them before the storm. Now, Linmo has completed yet another perfect resource cycle and value creation, and he&#x27;s beginning to move towards becoming a capitalist. Meanwhile, the attacks against him in the chat room have not stopped. Lynn Mo counted his gains.</p>
<p>He had a small inventory of metal materials, a few more blueprint templates, and several portions of key herbs. More importantly, he had established information channels through his communication with Sue Chian and Dragon Soul. He walked to a corner of the island and looked at the pile of light blue fishing ground templates. He planned to build a fishing ground, creating a barrier that would make others beg for his services. After finalizing his plan, he began construction.</p>
<p>A new day has begun, and Lin Mo&#x27;s business empire has just completed its first bloody initial accumulation and is about to enter the next stage. The road to rise is always fraught with skepticism. On this ocean, survival and thriving is the only truth and Linmo is steadily moving forward on this path. Chapter 6. Construction of the fish farm begins another turbulent turn.</p>
<p>The construction of Lin Mo&#x27;s first sophisticated fish farm was more complex than he had anticipated. Although the steps were clear on the blueprints, careful attention and certain skills were required in actual operation. Lynn Emmo spent most of the morning building the main structure of the first fishing ground. This fishing ground was located on the leeward southwest corner of the island, covering an area of about four square meters with pebbles and sand laid on the bottom. Although the output of this fish farm is not expected to be high, Linmo looked at the other 99 templates in the corner and calculated that 100 fish farms could stably produce hundreds of fish every day, which would become his reliance to get rid of the food crisis.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo built all of this. But while he had enough foundation stones, he lacked sufficient timber and stone, and water containers were even scarcer. He knew this task would take time and require meticulous planning. Linmo opened his bracelet and first dealt with the messages he received last night. Such Chanchian sent a timely weather forecast.</p>
<p>Next, Lin Mo saw the information about Dragon Soul Steel Gun, which revealed that Wings of Freedom was collecting fragments of some special relic. Lynmo replied, &quot;Message received. Cooperation can be discussed.&quot; He then requested that the other party provide a list of wings of freedom personnel and their operational patterns in the SH739 area as a bargaining chip. The fish fry problem became a headache for Lyno. The system didn&#x27;t explain how to obtain them, so he decided to solve it through trading.</p>
<p>He posted advertisements in the area and shops buying healthy saltwater fish. Each can be exchanged for fresh water or bread. Despite some skepticism, the lure of food and fresh water quickly brought in trading requests. Lynmo Mo&#x27;s first trade was with a dying clown fish. He paid for 100 milliliters of water and released the clown fish into the fish farm.</p>
<p>Over the next few hours, Lynn Mo continued to acquire more than 20 small sea fish. Although most of them were not in good condition, at least they were alive and had entered the pond, and the expected output of the fish farm slowly increased. The trading not only allowed Linmo mo to acquire fish fry but also enabled him to observe the situation of some players which was equivalent to conducting small-cale intelligence gathering. As evening fell a shout caught everyone&#x27;s attention. The speaker liu poisonous snake accused merchants of buying live fish and incited everyone to boycott these inscrupulous merchants ignored.</p>
<p>He switched back to his alternate account for buying fish and posted a short message. Not long after, transactions actually became more frequent than before. Lee Kuay&#x27;s cursing was eventually drowned out by the flood of trade messages. Lynn and Mo continued processing the transactions, remaining calm and releasing small fish into the fish pond one by one. Gradually, the number of fish in the pond increased, and the fish pond began to come alive again.</p>
<p>As night fell, Lynn Emote sat by the fish pond, watching the fish swim among the water. This foreshadowed the beginning of his future plans in this sea area. Lyn Mo looked up at the starry sky, a vague plan forming in his mind. Should he continue buying fish fry tomorrow or start planning the construction of his second fish farm? Or perhaps what should he do with his first fish? Chapter 7. The first bucket of fish.</p>
<p>Undercurrents abound. On the morning of the third day, Lynn Mo caught his first mullet with a modified net, which then activated a 100fold amplification, granting him 100 portions of fish meat. Looking at the still wriggling live fish in the net, Lynn Mo pondered to himself that the timing of the amplification judgment was a product of the instantaneous action of acquiring. He released the live fish back, thinking that this fish could continue to grow and might even reproduce, leaving him with sustainable resources. He then continued to check in and received rough fish bait, one pack X1, and simple fish basket blueprint, disposable, X1.</p>
<p>After the boost, he obtained a large amount of fish bait and 100 fish basket blueprints. Lynn Mo began other tasks. Dragon Soul Steel Gun sent intelligence about the Wings of Freedom Squad. Lynn Mo recorded this information and by analyzing the data and channel information, deduced several possible locations where supplies would be found. Next, Lin Mo posted a purchase request using an anonymous alternate account, stating that he was a long-term buyer of live shrimp, small crabs, shellfish, and various edible seaweed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he would only conduct fish and meat transactions with his previous partners. During the transaction, Lenmo also intentionally revealed that he needed a large amount of timber and stone to expand the experimental pool. In doing so, he once again traded fish for these basic building materials, successfully facilitating the flow of resources. By noon, the regional channel had changed and an urgent distress message dominated the screen. A large shark is attacking the island.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo noticed that rafts were starting to appear in the distress messages, meaning that someone had gained the ability to move. Lynn Emmo immediately contacted Sue Chanchen. Do you think this is an ordinary shark? Such Chian quickly replied, &quot;It might be a sea monster that has been enhanced due to the rules of this world. This indicates that there will be an extremely powerful threat. New needs began to emerge.</p>
<p>Defense and weapons.&quot; Lynmo had some rough arrow templates, but what he needed more were ranged weapons, so he tried to obtain them from unopened chests. Lynmo then opened 20 chests, mostly containing foundation stones, wood, and stone. However, in the 17 chest, he obtained the simple crossbow crafting blueprint. Lynn Emmo immediately studied the blueprint and began crafting. Picking up a crossbow and a rough wood, Linmo tried to shoot.</p>
<p>Although his first shot missed the target, he used a secondary account to post procurement information related to the blueprints for long-range attack weapons. The purchase request didn&#x27;t receive an immediate response, clearly indicating that weapons manufacturer knowledge was more valuable and sensitive in food. But Lin Mo was in a hurry. This was just a test. He knew the seed had been sewn.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, he continued tending to the fish pond and made several simple fish baskets using the blueprints, hoping to catch some shrimp and crabs. In the evening, he checked the regional channel again. There seemed to be no further news regarding the shark attack. Lee Kuay jumped in again, his encouragement for unity clearly aimed at winning over followers and establishing his authority. Linmo did not respond.</p>
<p>As night fell, Linmo sat in the fish farm. He knew that the first fish caught meant that a stable food supply was beginning to take off. While the shark attack foreshadowed a more direct threat that was about to come, the acquisition and purchase of the wooden crossbow blueprints signified his preparation for military force. While the forces operating in the shadows were quietly making their moves, Linmo gripped the crossbow tightly, feeling its heavy weight. In this sea, survival is no longer just a competition for resources, but a contest of strength and strategy.</p>
<p>And he will quietly carve out a place for himself in this game. He gazes southeast at the dark sharkinfested waters. What would come knocking next? Chapter 8. Fish meat enters the market, bidding in secrecy. After achieving a stable production of mullet, he chose a more discreet route to sell it.</p>
<p>using a rarelyused anonymous account to contact a user named Oldch Chun. He messaged Loud Chun through a secondary account. I have a reliable source for fresh fish, but it&#x27;s not cheap and the source can&#x27;t be revealed. Are you interested? La quickly replied, &quot;What kind of fish? How fresh is it? How do we trade?&quot; Lin Mo replied, &quot;It&#x27;s mullet. Each piece weighs about 3 ounces, and I can only provide a maximum of five pieces per day.</p>
<p>I only exchange it for hard currency or important information such as weapons. Oldchin finally replied 15 pieces of fish meat. He said he would exchange them for a rough wooden barricade templates. Lin Mo knew this was a defensive building template and finally agreed. He chose a neutral coordinate not far from the two islands and the transaction was completed an hour later.</p>
<p>The shark attacks remain a hot topic leading to a surge in demand for weapons and defenses. The previously quiet weapons trading posts are now appearing more frequently. Leo is very active in the channel, constantly promoting the concept of collective defense, which Lin Mo sneers inwardly. He switched back to his alternate account and a message caught his attention. The messages ID was a string of gibberish and it simply stated, &quot;Reliable longrange weapon manufacturing technology available.</p>
<p>In-person verification required. Extremely high price.&quot; Lynn Mo replied, &quot;How do I verify my qualifications?&quot; The other party sent coordinates, which were far from Linmo, and said they would meet in 3 days. Lynn Emmo noted down the coordinates and contacted Dragon Soul Steel Gun. Dragon Soul Steel Gun replied, &quot;It&#x27;s a dangerous area. I don&#x27;t recommend going there.&quot; Lynmo had an idea.</p>
<p>That garbled ID was either a reclusive master or a trap. After ending the communication, Lynn Mo stared at the distant coordinates filled with hesitation. At this moment, he was more inclined to profit from the hype surrounding the weapon purchases. He listed semi-finished weapons such as specially processed hardwood shafts and standard stone spearheads for sale on his alternate account. Linmo exchanged these semi-finish products, which cost almost nothing for a considerable amount of supplies and some intelligence.</p>
<p>One piece of information caught his attention. There was a rocky area that exposed a large beach at low tide, covered with oysters and barnacles. Lynn Mo noted the location and considered building a bamboo raft. As dusk fell, the fish in the fishing grounds swam peacefully. He hadn&#x27;t caught his second fish today, and the systems expected yield remained zero to two portions, consistent with his unstable setting.</p>
<p>He checked the fish baskets next to the fishing grounds and found little catch. Lie Kuay was organizing a joint defense discussion meeting. Lynn Immo noticed that the wings of freedom remained silent, but their people were constantly acquiring supplies. Suchian made a rare public analysis post, listing the habits of sharks and receiving many thanks. There was no new information from Dragon Soul, but Lynn Mo sensed that the information network beneath the surface was rapidly being woven.</p>
<p>He returned to the Thatch hut and began making his first rough wooden shio friez. The next storm might not come from the sky, but from the seemingly calm yet actually treacherous sea of the human heart. Chapter 9. First exploration of the reef, an unexpected ally. Building the raft was far more difficult than Lynn and Mo had imagined.</p>
<p>It took him entire day to barely cobble together a usable raft. It moved forward entirely by hand. Lynn and Mo chose to set off at dawn. He dragged several barricades to the edge of the island and secured them in key positions. He then set off with a simple crossbow, five wooden arrows, weapons, and food on his back.</p>
<p>He paddled into the water and the raft slowly left the island. Using the simple compass on his wristband, Lynn Emmo adjusted his course. He paddled very slowly and about 2 hours later, he saw his destination. A cluster of dark gray reefs gradually rose from the water, resembling the spine of a giant beast. Lyn Mo stopped the raft and carefully observed the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>After waiting for about half an hour to confirm that it was safe, Lin Mo went ashore. Upon arriving on the island, Lin Mo first noticed a broken plastic bucket. To his surprise, he found an item wrapped in tarpollen nestled in a crevice of a rock. Carefully unwrapping the tarpollen, he discovered it was a fragment of a map. The map displayed several strange symbols, one of which, circled in red, stood out prominently, next to which were the characters for touch beard.</p>
<p>Search warm currents converge, school of fish. He quickly tucked the map fragments away from his body. Then he began collecting oysters and barnacles. These are excellent food supplements and relatively easy to store. Live ones can be kept in seawater.</p>
<p>He then heard the sound of splashing. Lynn and Mo quickly lowered his body, pressing himself against a rock. The sound of splashing grew closer, accompanied by heavy breathing and muffled curses. Damn it. Can&#x27;t shake them off.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo&#x27;s gaze swept across, and he saw two disheveled figures. Less than 20 m behind them, a rapidly approaching triangular dorsal fin sliced through the water. Lynn Moe&#x27;s heart tightened. It seemed to be a juvenile bull shark, small in size, but noticeably faster. Just as the two men had dragged the raft halfway to the reef, the dark shadow closed in, accelerated, and slammed into the raft, which was still submerged in the water.</p>
<p>The two men quickly hid. Lynmo&#x27;s pupils contracted slightly. He recognized one of them as Big Lou, the man who had sold him the live fish before, but who seemed very honest. He didn&#x27;t know the other man. He was considering whether to save them.</p>
<p>If the bull shark succeeds in hunting here, this reef area will become its hunting ground, and all the resources he has painstakingly accumulated will be lost. Lynn Mo decided to take action. Lynmo quickly retrieved his makeshift crossbow and accurately aimed at the shark&#x27;s dorsal fin, which was exposed above the water, its most vulnerable spot. Lynmo pulled the trigger. The shark was hit and its blood stained the surrounding seawater red.</p>
<p>After being shot, the shark swiftly fled, leaving the two people on the reef stunned. They stared in the direction the shark had disappeared, still shaken, then looked around blankly. Lynmo then quickly boarded a raft and left. Lynmo only slowed down slightly after leaving the reef area and confirming that the two people were not chasing him. His heart was still pounding.</p>
<p>The expedition yielded far more than expected. shellfish, potentially invaluable fragments of nautical charts, and a secret rescue. This act of kindness was far more valuable than any direct resource transaction. Lynmo glanced back at the receding reef area. It was as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>It was still a potential source of food and materials. But after this experience, he knew he had to be much more careful next time. It was nearly noon when they rode back to their island. Lynn Mo hid the raft and immediately checked the barricades and fishing grounds. The fishing grounds panel showed that they had harvested another portion of fish meat today, bringing the total to 99 portions.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo processed the collected oysters and barnacles, then took out the three fragments of the nautical chart. The charts were marked with small blue dots, and next to them was written, &quot;Erosion eddies may contain abundant resources.&quot; He memorized this information. In the afternoon, Lynn Mo handled some transactions as usual, mainly orders for special hardwood poles and composite ropes, continuing to quietly accumulate resources and intelligence. On the regional channel, Lee Kuay was extensively publicizing the achievements of their self-defense force. Su Chian posted a brief announcement.</p>
<p>The area of abnormal temperature in the southeastern sea is showing a trend of expansion. There was no new information from Dragon Soul. The mysterious invitation was still 2 days away. Lyno sat by the fish farm eating grilled oysters. His first proactive exploration, though somewhat risky, had been very fruitful.</p>
<p>But he knew this was just the beginning. He needed faster boats, better weapons, more comprehensive intelligence, and reliable teammates. He recalled the image of Doo and his companion back to back raising their wooden spears on the reef. The premise was that everything had to be completely under control. He wondered where he should go on his next sea voyage.</p>
<p>He knew that the next step required careful planning. Chapter 10. Ocean invasion videos sold as guides. Linmo did not attend the mysterious invitation. He crossverified the information about the vicinity of that coordinate point through different channels.</p>
<p>Combining this with a warning from the dragon soul, Linmo came to a conclusion. The risks of the adventure far outweighed the potential rewards. Lynn Mo analyzed that there were at least three different groups of forces active near the coordinates. The so-called non-blint technology was likely just a lure to attract people like him who were eager for advanced weapon technology and had certain strength and resources. He turned his attention back to the island&#x27;s development.</p>
<p>He constructed three more barricades which together with the existing facilities formed a simple yet effective defensive line at the islands for corners. Meanwhile, the number of fish fry in his fish farm increased to over 30 and the expected yield rose to one to three portions. One morning, the sign-in light shone brighter than usual. Congratulations, you have obtained 1X archery skill book one-time use. 1x desalination plant template elementary.</p>
<p>Linmo immediately activated the amplification and 100 duplicate rewards appeared before him. He first picked up the basic archery skill book. He silently recited the instructions. Lynn Mo subconsciously picked up the simple crossbow beside him, knocked an arrow, and aimed at a floating object on the distant sea. The feeling was completely different.</p>
<p>Although it was only basic, his accuracy had increased by 30%. Next, he learned about desalination plant templates. He decided to make one to try it out. This would take some time. Around noon, a global announcement suddenly sounded.</p>
<p>A marine invasion event is about to begin. Event area. Area&#x27;s sh to SH 800. Warning. A large number of aggressive marine creatures will attack all islands in this area.</p>
<p>The announcement was repeated three times and the regional channel exploded instantly. Linmo stood up abruptly, his eyes sharp. He didn&#x27;t panic. Instead, he calmed down and quickly took stock of his defenses for a shioodaf, a simple crossbow equipped with basic archery skills, 20 wooden arrows, stone axes, and other supplies. He then found a waterproof electronic watch with a recording function.</p>
<p>He wanted to record the attack to sell it for money. According to the outline, Lynn Mo easily repelled the attack using weapons and defenses that were 100 times stronger. and then anonymously sold the recording for an exorbitant price. After preparing everything, Lin Mo received an urgent intelligence message from Su Chanchian. Key intelligence tells Lin Mo to reply immediately.</p>
<p>You also need to be careful. Such Chian replied, &quot;I have the S-level talent heart of the ocean, which allows me to communicate with gentle creatures.&quot; They ended the communication. Finally, the countdown reached zero. The first to surge ashore were countless large sea cockroaches, each the size of a palm with shiny black shells. Like a black tide, Lyn Mo raised his makeshift crossbow and fired at the giant cockroaches.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo disrupted the rhythm of several large red cockroaches. And at the same time, the first wave of sea cockroaches finally crashed into the barricades. Lynmo seized the opportunity to switch to his stone ax, and he chopped with all his might. Blood splattering everywhere. Although the battle was brief, it was exceptionally fierce.</p>
<p>The second wave of attacks quickly followed. Dozens of slender silver gray barracudas, their mouths full of sharp teeth, lunge straight at Linmo. Lynn Mo immediately retreated, firing a barracuda in rapid succession. But one barracuda broke through the defenses, biting hard into the animal hide tied to his calf. Lynn Emmo swung his ax at the head of the pike.</p>
<p>He used the barricades and his agile movement to fight back. But just then, the pike that had rushed forward even began attacking its own kind. This was because Sue Chanchian&#x27;s talent was coming into play. Lynn and Mo seized the opportunity, hurling two sharpened wooden spears that successfully pierced the other two barracudas. The barracudas began to retreat.</p>
<p>The sea temporarily returned to calm. He checked his digital watch. It should have recorded most of the events. Then came the third wave of attacks, the final test. The sea swelled and a giant red killer crab, the size of a water tank, slowly crawled onto the island.</p>
<p>This was a real test. Lynn Mo retreated repeatedly, his attacks temporarily ineffective, and he began to carefully observe the giant crab. While dodging, he fired his last few wooden arrows at its joints and compound eyes. Ultimately, Lin Montak emerged victorious. Suddenly, the system notification sounded.</p>
<p>Successfully repelled the marine life invasion. Received 30 foundation stones, 50 wood, 40 stones, one simple watchtowwer blueprint, one time use, three tough crab shells. A 100x reward was also triggered. After resting for a few minutes, he treated the wound on his leg, then put away his digital watch and check the video. Although the angle was fixed and the image was somewhat shaky, the intense struggle had been clearly recorded.</p>
<p>He carefully saved the video. Then he switched to his most secretive anonymous main account, Jay, which he only used at crucial moments, and posted an exorbitantly priced trade order. First ever Marine Invasion complete highdefinition video and strategy guide. Starting price, 1,000 milliliters of purified water. Trade method sealed auction ends in 1 hour.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo watched the stream of transaction information appear, knowing that this data could fetch an astronomical price. He leaned against the blood stained barricade, watching the gradually calming sea and the distant silhouettes of islands that had survived the catastrophe. Some bewildered, some weeping. The reputation of a cunning businessman will now spread even further, accompanied by a savior-like strategy. Crisis 2 is a stepping stone.</p>
<p>He has just taken another firm step up. Chapter 11. The scheme of ice and fire. The agent appears. The seal bid auction enters its final minute with prices fluctuating rapidly.</p>
<p>The price soarses to three units of refined iron ingots plus one rare reinforced fishing net blueprint plus 2,000 ml of purified water delivered in installments. Bidder code named Gray Fox. Without hesitation, Linmo confirmed Gray Fox as a successful bidder. When the countdown reached zero, the transaction was completed through the system, a highly secretive process. Lynn Mo received three fine iron ingots gleaming with a cold light along with other supplies.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Lin Mo chose, &quot;Amplify the refined iron ingots and purified water.&quot; A flash of light and 300 refined iron ingots and 100,000 ml, 1,000 bottles of purified water were stored. As for the blueprint for the reinforced fishing net, it was kept as a finished product. Linmo began to examine the blueprint carefully. He discovered that reinforcing the fishing net required two iron wires, a refined iron wire, and one magic dust or alternative energy powder. These were two things he had never heard of before.</p>
<p>He decided to learn about them if he had the chance. Having just finished a transaction, Lin Mo received a private message from Sue Chanchan, her tone urgent. I&#x27;ve detected some anomalies. I&#x27;m fine. Rating A.</p>
<p>What anomalies. Then Montac replied. Su Chanchian said she detected a drop in temperature. A cold wave. Linmo immediately thought of the extreme cold weather mentioned in the outline.</p>
<p>Can you predict the timing and intensity? Linmo asked. The data is insufficient, but we&#x27;ll have clear results soon. Su Chanhan replied. Understood. Thank you.</p>
<p>This information is very valuable. What supplies do you need? I can provide some. Linmo offered his help. Such Chanchian directly listed her needs. He decided to send a batch of sturdy ropes and thick canvas fragments from a box to the coordinates specified by Sue Chanchan via an anonymous account.</p>
<p>This was a reward for her previous interference with the Barracuda school and a gesture of sincerity for future cooperation. Su Chanchian quickly received the supplies and replied briefly. I received the items. Thank you. I will continue to monitor the cold wave situation and let you know as soon as there are any new developments.</p>
<p>Take care. The communication ended and Lynmo&#x27;s vigilance immediately heightened. The approaching cold wave was both a huge crisis and a business opportunity. He immediately began taking stock of his supplies. And after the inventory, he discovered that he had many items suitable for winter use.</p>
<p>The immediate priority is to stockpile raw materials for cold weather supplies and find effective heating methods as soon as possible. He switched to an anonymous account again, this time as a breeding experimentter, and posted new information. He was buying all types of fur, high prices. High prices for all types of furs, size, condition, etc. thick fabrics such as canvas, felt, oily wood such as pine, combustible minerals or pete information, any drawings, templates or oddities related to insulation or heating.</p>
<p>Prices will absolutely satisfy you and can be exchanged for food, fresh water or specified materials. The regional channels responded tepidly after the information was released. Most people were still gripped by the fear of casualties from the attack or busy repairing the island and had not yet fully reacted to the cold wave warning. Only a few people brought out tattered rabbit skins or wet wool trying to trade them for some food. Lynn Emmo wasn&#x27;t in a hurry.</p>
<p>He knew that once the cold wind became biting and no one could bear the cold, the prices of these currently unwanted supplies would skyrocket. He began buying up first scraps and exchanging them for food and started working on transforming the island. He used more barricades and timber to build a closed auxiliary shed in a sheltered spot, connecting it to the existing thatched shed to minimize heat loss. The interior was lined with animal hides and oil cloth, creating a relatively insulated inner room. Next, he tried to hammer and assemble a simple iron stove using refined iron ingots.</p>
<p>Lacking specialized tools, he could only rely on a stone axe and his polishing skills. The finished product, though imperfect, had a firebox and a flu. Bamboo pipes and clay were used as temporary substitutes. He first tested it with ordinary wood as fuel. Although the smoke was plentiful, it was much more concentrated than an open air campfire, at least enough to provide warmth and heat food.</p>
<p>Just as he was sweating profusely while troubleshooting the broken furnace, a new private message caught his attention. Center ID: Money Manager. My friend who is anonymously buying winter supplies. I am a welloff and honest businessman. Seeing your clear intention to buy and your generous offer, you must have sensed some opportunity.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not very capable, but I also sense that something is brewing. I happen to have a batch of good snow rabbit fur complete and tarwood long burning and produces little smoke. I wonder if you&#x27;d be interested. Chin duo duo. Lyn Mo was taken aback.</p>
<p>Wasn&#x27;t this the core supporting character manager Chien mentioned in the outline? He had come to him on his own initiative. Lynn Mo cautiously replied, &quot;How can I prove you have the goods? How can I guarantee the security of the transaction?&quot; Chando duo quickly sent several clear pictures. A dozen or so snow white cleaned rabbit pelts and dozens of shiny heatresistant pieces of tarwood. The goods are on the island. Small batch inspections are possible.</p>
<p>For security, it&#x27;s a system transaction, anonymous, with each party bearing their own risk. I value my reputation. It doesn&#x27;t look fake. Tarwood is indeed a good thing, suitable for heating. Lynn Mo pondered for a moment, then decided to proceed.</p>
<p>Okay, first trade, five snow rabbit pelts and 10 pieces of tarwood. What do you want in return? Your offer to acquire items in exchange for food, fresh water, or specific materials? I urgently need reinforced ropes and standard planks to fortify my dwelling. Chandwood&#x27;s goal was clear. These are precisely the semifinished products that Lynn Mo can mass-produce and exchanging them for winter supplies is a very worthwhile deal. Deal made.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the transaction method? Same as always. Message in a bottle. Coordinates swapped. Chi and Duodu suggested. The transaction was completed quickly.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo received the snow rabbit pelt and tar wood while Chin Duodo received the rope and planks he provided. After the transaction was completed, Chin Duo Duo sent a message. Pleasant cooperation. Just a reminder, your large-scale purchase of winter supplies has probably attracted the attention of Wings of Freedom. They are also secretly buying furs and fuel, and their actions are quite significant.</p>
<p>Wings of Freedom, they started making moves, too. Lin Mo felt the chill run down his spine. &quot;Thanks for the reminder. How much of your goods can I take?&quot; Lin Emo asked. &quot;We still have over 30 pelts and over a 100 pieces of tarwood.&quot; Chin Duo Duo answered definitively.</p>
<p>&quot;We can continue the transaction and deepen our cooperation depending on your performance.&quot; Lynmo gave a vague promise. &quot;Understood. I will certainly not disappoint you.&quot; Chin Duo Duo did not ask any further questions. Lynn Mo gaze at the soft snow rabbit skin and the jet black tarwood in his hands. The shadow of the cold wave drawing ever closer.</p>
<p>The first potential ally and proxy has emerged. Wings of freedom has also begun its preparations. The market is about to boil over again due to the low temperatures. He walked to the crooked tin stove, added a piece of tar wood, and flames rose, emitting a fragrant aroma that dispelled the chill. The fire light illuminated his pensive face.</p>
<p>Next, it&#x27;s time to stockpile winter supplies and prepare for the cold wave. In this new crisis, he will once again play the role of someone both hated and indispensable. Unscrupulous merchant, he spread out a snow rabbit skin and felt its soft, warm texture. Was he going to sell this time? For coats, fuel, or a warm-up guide on how to survive in this frozen world? Chapter 12. Cold wave warning.</p>
<p>Stockpiling frenzy. Su Chanchians warning finally came true on the third day. Lyn Mo woke up early in the morning and immediately sensed something was wrong with his surroundings. The sea breeze on his face no longer carried the warm damp scent of the sea, but rather a dry, cold, stinging sensation. The sky was grayish white, and the sun, like a yolk covered with frosted glass, hung weakly on the horizon.</p>
<p>The ambient temperature displayed on his wristband was 12° C. Compared to the comfortable temperature of over 20° C a few days ago, today&#x27;s temperature has dropped by more than 10° C, and it is still slowly decreasing. Finally, someone on the regional channel began to notice the anomaly. What&#x27;s going on? Why is it suddenly so cold? I couldn&#x27;t sleep last night because it was so cold and the shed was drafty. The sea water doesn&#x27;t seem that cold.</p>
<p>So, why is the wind so biting? This isn&#x27;t right. This is definitely not right. Although panic has not yet spread widely, astute survivors have already noticed something a miss on trading platforms. The number of listings for previously unwanted items like tattered furs and old blankets has quietly increased and prices have begun to rise slightly. Lin knew that the window of opportunity was rapidly closing.</p>
<p>While accelerating the island&#x27;s winterization efforts, he also considered how to maximize the use of the approaching cold wave. He tightly wrapped the two shacks on the island with more animal hides and oil cloth, carefully sealing the gaps with a mixture of seaweed and wet mud. After several adjustments, the crooked tin stoves flu was reinforced with clay and stones, making smoke extraction much smoother. Linmo filled the stove with tar wood, and the small interior quickly became warm and cozy. He tested it.</p>
<p>In this well-sealed room, a simple earthnware pot was placed by the stove and the water inside remained unfrozen throughout the entire night. This discovery was crucial to him as it meant he could maintain a supply of liquid drinking water even during cold snaps. Meanwhile, Lynn Emmo intensified his resource acquisition efforts through several anonymous accounts. This time, he not only bought furs and fuel, but also began to focus on anything that could generate heat. oily dried fish, rumored self-heating minerals, and even something that someone mentioned could be extracted from certain seaweed as warm-blooded mucus.</p>
<p>To maintain a low profile, Lynn Mo&#x27;s acquisition price was 20% to 30% higher than the market price. He demanded that all transactions remain anonymous and be completed quickly. He paid with his own miscellaneous items from special ropes, standard planks, and hardwood poles to some less sensitive metal parts, and even some low-grade blueprint copies that he no longer needed. This barter method not only reduces the outflow of food and fresh water, but also keeps his secret. Not long after, Chin Duo Duo sent another private message, this time with an even more urgent tone.</p>
<p>Sir, the market trend has changed. This morning, the number of people asking about furs and tar would has increased several times over. Wings of freedom has already publicly listed their goods for purchase and the price has been raised very high. Our batch of goods. Linmo calmly replied, &quot;Continue shipping as planned, but in batches over a longer period with a 5% price increase each time.&quot; He smiled slightly, knowing what these changes meant.</p>
<p>The more aggressively they buy, the higher our profit margin will be. The goods you have, excluding those reserved for your own use, will be shipped out in 10 batches, two batches per day. Prioritize transactions with individual buyers and small groups. For buyers from Wings of Freedom and suspected affiliates, double the price or require them to exchange them for special items. Wonderful.</p>
<p>You truly understand the ways of the market, Chen Duo Duo replied. In addition, IV obtained another batch of dried Adal vice leaves through some channels. This stuff is excellent for starting fires and produces a faint warmth when burning. Also, regarding warm-blooded mucus, I heard that knowledgeable information broker called Knowit All seems to know something about it, but he has very nervous and the price is exorbitant. A know-it-all that chatterbox from that regional channel.</p>
<p>Lynmo recalled the time he bought the coordinates. Looks like this guy is indeed quite well informed. I&#x27;ll take the Adal vice 20% above the market price. Contact Bayong and sound them out. If the information is reliable, we can buy it outright.</p>
<p>You decide the price and we&#x27;ll settle the accounts later. Lynn Mo gave Chin Duo Duo a certain degree of autonomy. Agents need training and trust and this trust must be within a controllable range. Understood. Chin Duo Duo replied with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>After ending the communication, Lynn Emmo opened a regional channel. He saw Lee Kuay promoting his collective cold weather protection plan, calling on everyone to pull their resources and build a large bunker to share warmth. To Lynn Mo surprise, there were quite a few respondents, especially those survivors who had suffered heavy losses before the cold wave and were struggling to cope alone. Then Emmo sneered. This kind of model would almost certainly collapse in extreme environments.</p>
<p>Issues of resource allocation, trust, and power struggles would likely turn such a large bunker into hell once the harsh winter and resource shortages truly arrived. He wasn&#x27;t interested in ignoring those pointless discussions and instead focused on another analysis posed by Suchian. This time she listed several simple methods for quickly assessing the intensity and speed of a cold wave, observing the fluffiness of seabird feathers, testing the temperature difference at different depths, and recording the closing reaction speed of specific intertital shellfish. These methods were professional and practical, earning the gratitude of many survivors. He sent Sue Chian a private message.</p>
<p>Is the temperature dropping faster than expected? Su Chanhan quickly replied, &quot;Yes, the heart of the ocean sensory feedback shows signs of a large-scale cold current surging up from the deep sea. This is not an ordinary temperature drop, but a systemic climate change. At its coldest, nighttime temperatures may drop below zero or even lower. This could last for more than a week. Sub-zero for a week, Lynn Moshart sank.</p>
<p>This was far more severe than he had anticipated. Many people&#x27;s makeshift shelters simply couldn&#x27;t hold up. and the problems of heating and food could very well become fatal. Do you need a more complete heating solution? I have a rough stove design that I can share. Lyno offered a furnace.</p>
<p>You made it yourself. Such an a little surprised. I tried surrounding the fire pit with stones, but the heat dissipated too quickly and produced too much smoke. If there&#x27;s a more efficient design, I&#x27;m willing to exchange it for the predicted data on the movement path of the cold flow core that I observe over the next 3 days. Deal.</p>
<p>Linmo responded decisively. Clearly, Su Chanchians value went far beyond just providing early warnings. Her survival skills and ability to continuously observe were extremely important to Linmo. Okay, I&#x27;ll give you the data. Sue Chanchin agreed.</p>
<p>Also, you must be very careful. During a cold wave, people as hearts may be more dangerous than the low temperatures. Dot the same as you. After ending the conversation, Lynn Emmo walked out of the shed. In just that short time, his breath had turned in a white mist.</p>
<p>The temperature had probably dropped below 10° C. The sea still looked calm, but its color seemed to have become even deeper. He inspected the fish pond. The fish were noticeably sluggish, congregating in the deeper parts of the pond. He made a makeshift insulation cover for the fish pond using tarp pollen and animal hides, hoping it would hold out.</p>
<p>If the water froze, he would have to consider breaking the ice and increasing oxygen levels. In the afternoon, Chiian Duo Duo sent a new message. Beetang did indeed know about the warm-blooded mucus sourced from his informant on another regional channel. It said that a type of warm water sea slug inhabits certain special coral reef areas in the south where the impact of cold waves is less pronounced. Its secretions have a slight self-heating and insulating effect, but it&#x27;s extremely difficult to obtain and its yield is very low.</p>
<p>Bashitang&#x27;s offer was 10 standard ropes or equivalent food in exchange for specific coordinates and key points for catching it. Give him five ropes and first he needs the coordinates and half of the key points. Pay the rest after verification. Lynn Mo instructed. He didn&#x27;t completely trust Bashang, but this investment was worth a try.</p>
<p>Soon the coordinates and some information arrived. The location was far away, situated on the southern edge of the SH739 area, close to the boundary with other areas. Although we couldn&#x27;t go there now, we recorded this information first. As evening approached, the temperature neared 5° C. The sea breeze was biting cold and posts seeking to purchase winter supplies flooded the regional chat.</p>
<p>Prices refers thick cloth and fuel skyrocketed. The illusion of supply shortages created by Lynn Mo and Shindwa&#x27;s previous secret acquisitions coupled with the surge in genuine demand had driven the market into a frenzy. Wings of Liberty publicly posted an exorbitant purchase order with a forceful tone and a hint of threat demanding priority supply to them. Some small teams have started to band together for mutual support which has intensified the competition for resources. Le Kuay&#x27;s bunker project seems to have encountered difficulties with some people complaining in the channel about unfair distribution and accusing the managers of hoarding supplies.</p>
<p>Chaos began to emerge. Linmo sat in his warm inner room with a tar covered with stove flickering in front of him. He held a piece of warm smooth snow rabbit skin and on the screen in front of him was a detailed profit report sent by Chin Duo Duo for the batches of goods shipped out. Most of the transactions were through barter in exchange for metals, special materials, and even two decent defense blueprints. His bracelet space was already filled with a large amount of raw materials for keeping warm, and it was still growing.</p>
<p>Before the cold wave had fully arrived, the first wave of stockpiling had already been largely completed quietly. He took a sip of warm water, his gaze calm. This is just the beginning. When the temperature drops to freezing, when the first snowflake falls, when despair and cold choke most people, the warmth he has stockpiled will become incredibly precious and may even become a resource that everyone seeks. At that time, he will become the true master of this sea area.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the wind howled mournfully like the wailing of ghosts. The crackling fire in the warm fireplace inside reflected in Lin Mo&#x27;s deep eyes. He is waiting. Wait until the cold wave is at its most intense. Also, waiting for those will soon come to buy life.</p>
<p>Chapter 13. Frozen World. Warm Deal. The real cold wave broke out suddenly and completely around 2:00 a.m. If the previous warnings were just of dry cold, then now extreme cold has officially arrived.</p>
<p>A chilling soul freezing wind howled across the sea, carrying fine salt-like ice crystals that lashed everything in its path. The mercury column actually dyed alcohol of the thermometer, a makeshift version Lynn Mo had created using glass tubes and alcohol visibly shrank to below -5° C and continued to drop. Lynmo was awakened by the cold. Even though he was in the inner room wrapped in layers of animal hides and with a fire still burning, his breath was so thick it was hard to breathe and he could feel the stinging air on his cheeks. He immediately added two pieces of charred wood to the stove and the fire blazed up again, dispelling some of the chill.</p>
<p>He put on the thickest snow rabbit skin with a layer of canvas sewn inside. Walked to the door of the shed and lifted a corner of the oilcloth curtain. The sight outside made him gasp for breath. Under the pale moonlight, the entire sea was covered with an eerie grayish white layer ice. Not a solid layer of ice, but countless tiny icicles, shards, and rapidly freezing thin ice, colliding with each other as the waves pushed them apart, producing a teeth grinding crunch.</p>
<p>At the edge of his island, the waves crashing and instantly froze into layers of ice. The air was terrifyingly clear and terrifyingly cold. The bracelet vibrated wildly, and the regional channel was completely flooded with desperate cries and pleas for help. Cold. So cold I can&#x27;t feel my fingers.</p>
<p>Water. My fresh water has frozen and the bottle is cracked. Fire. Does anyone have a fire? My fire was blown out by the wind. Help.</p>
<p>My shed has collapsed. Who can save me? Wings of liberty leader. I&#x27;m in. I&#x27;ll do anything. Give me something to keep me warm.</p>
<p>Chaos. Collapse. Despair. The frigid temperatures, more direct and brutal than storms and ocean intrusion, are rapidly robbing people of any hope of survival. Linmo quickly shut down the channel to avoid being distracted by negative emotions.</p>
<p>He first checked his critical equipment. A layer of frost had formed on the fish farm&#x27;s insulation cover, but the water below was not completely frozen. The fish were gathered in the center of the pond, their activity almost completely still. He carefully broke through the thin ice at the edge and threw in a little crushed tar with chips. The residue from which burns also provides a small amount of heat.</p>
<p>The earth and wear jars containing fresh water were placed near the stove and the water temperature was acceptable. Food reserves were plentiful. The barricades and obstacles surrounding the island were covered with icicles, but the structure remained intact. Having confirmed that he was temporarily safe, he took a deep breath of the cold air, his eyes becoming sharp and calm. The time has come.</p>
<p>He switched to the anonymous account he used to contact Shiendu Duo and found that Shiendu Duo had sent several urgent messages 10 minutes earlier. Sir, the coal wave has fully erupted. The market is in complete chaos. The Wings of Liberty are offering exorbitant prices for all winter supplies, but they require sellers to personally go to their designated trading island. Many people are afraid of being ripped off and dare not go.</p>
<p>It seems there&#x27;s something wrong with Li Kuaya&#x27;s group&#x27;s bunker. The heating inside is insufficient. A fight broke out and people died. Retail investors and small groups are the main buyers now, but they have little hard currency and mostly want to exchange it for information or labor. Dot.</p>
<p>How should we proceed? As originally planned, Lynn Mo quickly replied, &quot;The original plan has been adjusted. Large-scale shipments of tarwood and high-grade furs are suspended. Instead, the following items will be sold. One, standard warming pack containing one portion of Adal vice, two small pieces of tar wood, and one palmsiz warm fur. Two, emergency warming roll, thick strips of cloth soaked in tar, which can burn slowly for about half an hour.</p>
<p>Three, hot drink pack, dried ginger root powder or pungent seaweed powder, which can temporarily raise body temperature when brewed. All items will be sold individually in small packages. What about the price? Shin Duo Duo asked immediately, &quot;Don&#x27;t fix prices. Use an auction or barter first model. Focus on acquiring high-grade medals, complete tools, skill book clues, any information about the Stonemason Brotherhood or ruins, and gold or gemstone items.&quot; Lin Mo instructed during the cold wave, the importance of food and basic materials decreases relatively, while items that can enhance long-term strength or contain secrets may be underestimated.</p>
<p>Understood. Ill handle the packaging and descriptions. The LL be sure to be appealing. Also, I suggest opening up pre-sale and reservation services, collecting deposits, and promising priority supply after the peak of the cold wave. This way, we can lock in future demand and recoup some resources, Chin Duo Duo added, demonstrating her indeed flexible business acumen.</p>
<p>Okay, you have full authority to handle everything and report the accounts daily. Be careful and try to conduct transactions through messages and bottles or designated neutral coordinates to avoid revealing your island&#x27;s location. Then Montac authorized, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ve taken the opportunity to develop downlines in several small groups allowing them to conduct transactions separately, so it&#x27;s very safe.&quot; Chandu Duo said confidently. After ending the call with Chin Duo Duo, Lyno thought for a moment and then sent a message to Sue Chian.</p>
<p>The cold wave has arrived. How&#x27;s the situation on your end? Is the stove working? A few minutes later, Sue Chanchian replied, her tone tired but calm. The furnace is great. It&#x27;s been a lifesaver. The temperature is -8° C and still dropping.</p>
<p>The sea ice is severe and heart of the ocean has detected a large number of shallow sea creatures dying or going dormant. Also, I sensed an abnormal heat source about 15 km to the southeast. It&#x27;s very weak but persistent and doesn&#x27;t seem to be any living organism or ordinary flame. Could it be some kind of geothermal leak or a special resource point set up by the system? A special resource point? Lynmo&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. In the extreme cold, a stable heat source is invaluable, but 15 km is too far on the frozen sea.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s currently impossible to reach. Mark the coordinates. Continue to monitor your condition and pay attention to your safety. If you feel unwell, let me know and I can provide some emergency supplies. Linmo replied.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m fine. I have enough supplies. Thank you. You start a business now, right? Are those new warm packs in the channel you&#x27;re doing? Suchan asked astutely. It&#x27;s just mutually beneficial, Lyn Mo said without denying it.</p>
<p>Be careful of Wings of Freedom. They seem to be investigating the source of these supplies. Also, Leoay might be finished soon. Some of his men are contacting me privately. Wanting to exchange some information about Wings of Freedoms stockpiling locations for warm supplies, Such Chian warned, &quot;You can take the intelligence and give them a small amount of heating supplies to keep them hanging.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry about Leo.&quot; Linmo instructed. Lee Kuay&#x27;s collapse was expected. His remaining forces might be able to extract some valuable information. After dealing with these matters, Linmo began to personally manage another aspect, the high-end market. He used the most mysterious J number to post a short message on the regional channel.</p>
<p>J buying all blueprints, templates, skills, or exact information on relics related to polar, cold resistance, geothermal, and permanent insulation can be exchanged for customized advanced cold protection suit or stable heat source solution. Private messages only with credible proof. The message, though brief, was like a drop of cold water into a boiling oil pan. Boss Jay has appeared. high-end winter clothing, stable heat source.</p>
<p>He really did have some in stock and even better ones. Looking to buy? I have a fragment of a constant temperature rune, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s genuine. The IDJ has become legendary due to its global first upgrade and strategy video. His buyin post immediately attracted the attention of high-end players who possessed truly valuable items, but struggled to monetize them or exchange them for urgently needed survival supplies. His inbox was quickly flooded with messages.</p>
<p>Most were either boasts or scams, but Lynn Mo quickly filtered them thanks to his exceptional memory and analytical skills. A private message caught his attention. The sender&#x27;s ID was a string of hieroglyphic gibberish, and the message contained only one sentence. Path of eternity clue in exchange for a solution or equivalent that can maintain core body temperature for more than 24 hours. the path of eternal frost.</p>
<p>That sounds like a location or quest line. Lyn Mo replied, &quot;How do I prove the value of this clue?&quot; The other party sent a blurry picture which appeared to be an ice crystal containing a strangely shaped bronze key. The keys handle had a snowflake-shaped indentation. The key is 30 m below Ice Kiss Cliff in area SH71. The route information is in my mind.</p>
<p>Pay half the price up front, the rest after verification. Ice Kiss Cliff. That sounds like an extremely cold place. The other party is either an adventurer or a native if they are. The clues are hard to verify, but the picture doesn&#x27;t look like a composite.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo thought for a moment and replied, &quot;I can provide the recipe for the continuous heating agent, which requires specific seaweed to make and a preliminary set of materials in exchange for complete path information and a map showing the exact location of the key. The transaction method is information will be delivered in segments and exchanged simultaneously. Sure, the other party agreed readily. Lynn Mo combined the information about warm water sea slug that he had previously bought from Beayhatang with his own rudimentary knowledge of potions, his previous life&#x27;s gaming experience to compile a half-true, half false basic warming potion recipe and sent it over along with a small amount of the seaweed powder that Sue Chanchian had mentioned earlier, which had a slight warming effect. The other party then sent a detailed text description on how to find the hidden crevice on a seemingly identical ice cliff as well as the ice cave structure to be aware of and the potential threat of frost eating worms once inside.</p>
<p>The location of the key was marked very specifically. The transaction is complete. Lenmo cannot verify for now, but we&#x27;ll save it for later. If he has the ability to explore extremely cold regions in the future, this clue might be the key. For the entire day, Lin Mo stayed in the warm inner room, his fingers rapidly operating on the light screen like a calm operator, controlling the flow of resources and information at different levels.</p>
<p>Chindwood achieved brilliant results. The warm pack series was sold out and in return, they received a large amount of miscellaneous but useful supplies and intelligence. The pre-orders also have a long backlog. On the J side, several valuable private messages were also received. In exchange for some customized solutions, which were actually different levels and quantities of cold weather supplies according to the other party&#x27;s needs, two clues to rare blueprints and a piece of vague information about the location of a secret reserve island of Wings of Freedom were obtained.</p>
<p>Night fell again, and the temperature dropped to -12° C. The wind howled like the wailing of ghosts on the regional channels. Cries for help gradually thinned out. Not because people were rescued, but because many were no longer able to speak out or had fallen silent forever. On Lin Moe&#x27;s Island, the fire in the stove was stable and the food was warm.</p>
<p>He tallied up today&#x27;s harvest. The variety of supplies had increased and the information network had been further expanded. Outside the window lies a frozen hell. Inside the window, a warm flame flickers alone, and in its reflection, a pair of calm eyes calculating everything. Cold waves are both disasters and filters, eliminating the weak and reshaping order.</p>
<p>And he, in this reshaping of order, is quietly occupying a crucial position. Not the most powerful overlord, but the one who holds the lifeline of warmth. The underground king. Chapter 14. Beneath the ice cliff, the stormy sailboat.</p>
<p>The plan to explore Ice Kiss Cliff lingered in Linmo&#x27;s mind for 2 days. The cold wave has reached its peak in the past 2 days. Nighttime temperatures have plummeted to nearly -15° C and daytime temperatures rarely exceed -5° C. The sea is covered with ice flows, rendering most areas unnavigable but creating rugged ice roads. Regional channel activity has plummeted with survivors huddled in their barely maintained shelters, barely surviving.</p>
<p>Trade has almost come to a standstill with only sporadic barter messages appearing. Linmo&#x27;s island became a rare warm island in this frozen sea. Ample fuel, excellent insulation, and a stable food supply. The fishing ground survived under careful care, and the low temperatures even made some fish meat firmer allowed him to plan with ease. He couldn&#x27;t reach the coordinates of the abnormal heat source provided by Suchian for the time being.</p>
<p>However, Ice Kiss Cliff located on the edge of SH701 area was about 40 km away from his location. This distance under icy conditions meant that if he had a sled or any tool capable of rapid movement across the ice, he thought of the mountains of timber and animal hides. There were no metal rails, but a base made of smooth hardwood covered with tough animal hide could be used to reduce friction. Pulling it by hand was definitely not an option too slow and too strenuous. Perhaps wind power could be used.</p>
<p>He thought of the spare tarpolins. A simple ice sled. The structure can be even simpler. A triangular wooden frame with smooth wooden slats at the bottom. A mass directed and a piece of tarpolin hung as a sail.</p>
<p>On a relatively flat ice surface with the help of a stable crosswind, it should be able to achieve decent speed. He spent half a day hammering and tinkering, creating a barely presentable ice sled. He then used ropes and leftover animal hides to make a warm cabin and a heavy set of ice field gear. Once everything was ready, he contacted Sue Chian. I need to go to Ice Kisscliff to retrieve something.</p>
<p>I need your heart of the ocean to help me sense the biological activity in that area, especially underwater and sub ice threats, Linmo said bluntly. This exploration was quite risky and Su Chians perception abilities were crucial. Su Chian replied quickly, her tone filled with worry. Icekiss Cliff, I&#x27;ve heard of it. It&#x27;s a notorious dangerous place in District 701, where there are often abnormal air currents and icing phenomena before cold waves.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s too dangerous to go there now. My senses will be severely interfered with by the thick ice and extreme low temperatures, limiting their range and accuracy. I know the risks, but that thing is crucial to my next step of development. We ll provide as much perception as possible. The key being whether there are signs of large or group based aggressive biological activity underwater and on the ice.</p>
<p>In return, I could provide enough advanced fuel packs to sustain you through the remainder of the cold wave and a set of improved stove design blueprints that Linmo offered his bargaining chips. Su Chian was silent for a moment. Okay, I&#x27;ll try my best. When are you leaving? I need time to concentrate on my senses, and I can&#x27;t do it for too long. The low temperature is very mentally taxing.</p>
<p>Tomorrow at dawn, when the light is best and the wind may be relatively calm, you&#x27;ll begin sensing half an hour in advance, covering a 1 km radius around Ice Kiss Cliff. Continuing until I send a safety signal or lose contact, Linmo planned. Understood. I will do my best. Take care, LinMo.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian said finally. Before dawn the next day, Linmo was fully armed. His inner layer was a sewn rabbit skin coat. The middle layer a thick canvas and a lining filled with dried seaweed and the outer layer a waterproof tarpolen. He wore goggles and a mask made from thin animal hide and glass shards.</p>
<p>His weapons included a simple crossbow and all the arrows. A new batch had been made with a straighter hardwood shaft, a stone axe, and a dagger at his waist, and a backpack containing food, fuel, tools, and emergency medicine on his back. He boarded the ice sled and adjusted the sail. A steady northwest wind was blowing today, which was a crosswind tailwind for his journey to the ice kiss cliffs in the northeast. He untied the securing ropes.</p>
<p>The oil cloth sail billowed in the wind, and the ice sled began to slide. At first, it was a little stiff, but as he gained speed, it became smoother and smoother on the slippery ice. The cold wind whipped at his face, but his winter gear proved effective. He maneuvered the makeshift rudder, a movable tail plate, and headed towards the designated coordinates. The 40 km icy road took nearly 3 hours.</p>
<p>Along the way, he encountered several ice creasses and piles of ice, forcing him to slow down and detour. On one occasion, he heard a dull thud coming from beneath the ice, which gave him a fright, but ultimately nothing broke through the ice. As he approached the ice kiss cliff, the sight before him was breathtaking. It was a towering gray black cliff hundreds of meters high, as if cleaved by a giant ax, steep and jagged. The side of the cliff facing the sea was covered with a thick layer of ice, shimmering with a deep blue hue, like a waterfall frozen in time.</p>
<p>The surface of the ice was riddled with cracks and enormous icicles shimmering with a cold light in a morning glow. This was the ice kiss, a kiss that seemed to be frozen between the sea and the cliff in the extreme cold. According to the information obtained from the transaction, the key is hidden in a secluded ice cave 30 m below the cliff. The entrance is at a height close to sea level. Now, the ice surface obscured by a protruding canine tooth-shaped giant ice block.</p>
<p>Lin Mo stopped his ice sled about 500 meters from the cliff and secured it to a solid ice mound with ropes. He sent Su Chian a short message. Arrived at the outer perimeter. Su Chanhan quickly replied, her voice tired but clear. I sense several faint life signs in the waters below the ice cliff.</p>
<p>They resemble large jellyfish or mollisks moving slowly and their threat level is currently assessed as low. There are hollow echoes within the ice layer. It&#x27;s uncertain whether they are natural ice caves or nests. Be aware that there are signs of loosening ice cones above the cliff. My perception can only last for a maximum of 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Received. That&#x27;s enough. Lynn Mo replied. He took a deep breath, checked his equipment, and then walked towards the location of the giant fong ice block. The ice surface was uneven, covered with broken ice and slippery ice algae.</p>
<p>He walked carefully, trying to minimize the vibration of his footsteps. The cold wind howled between the cliffs, swirling up ice crystals that rustled against his body. Approaching the giant ice formation resembling a canine tooth, a narrow crevice barely wide enough for one person to bend over and pass through was indeed discovered behind it. It extended inwards, dark and emanating a chilling aura. The ice ridges along the crevices edge resembled sharp teeth.</p>
<p>This is the place. Lynn Mo lit a thin stick soaked in tar as a makeshift torch and bent down to crawl inside. It was a downward sloping ice tunnel, incredibly smooth. One had to use a dagger to carve out footholds before slowly descending. The cold was biting.</p>
<p>Even with winter gear, one could feel the chill that seemed to freeze to the bone. After descending about 20 m, the tunnel widened, leading into a small ice cave. Icicles hung from the ceiling and the floor was a smooth mirror-l like ice surface. In the fire light, the ice walls reflected a memerizing blue light. According to the information, the key was frozen deep inside the ice wall, directly opposite the entrance.</p>
<p>Then Mo approached, torch in hand, searching carefully. Sure enough, about half an arm&#x27;s length inside the ice wall, a distorted shadow could be vaguely seen. He needs to break the ice. He can&#x27;t be too forceful lest the ice cave collapse or knock down the icicles. He took the stone axe from his back and carefully little by little tapped the ice with the back of the axe.</p>
<p>The crisp clear sound echoed in the ice cave. Every few taps he would stop to listen and make sure there was no unusual noise. The ice was very hard and progress was slow. Time was ticking away and Suchian&#x27;s perception time was probably running out. Just as he had dug a shallow pit and could vaguely see the outline of the bronze key, a sudden change occurred.</p>
<p>A faint crack sound suddenly came from the ice beneath his feet. It wasn&#x27;t from where he was chiseling, but from the side ice wall. Then Monta retreated instantly. Almost simultaneously, the eyes where he had just stood shattered, and several pale semi-transparent tentacles resembling enlarged maggots suddenly emerged, their tips bearing sucker-like mouth parts and lunged towards his original spot. Frost eating bugs, the threat mentioned in the message.</p>
<p>They lurk in the ice and are extremely sensitive to vibrations. When the attack missed, the tentacles quickly retracted and a grading rustling sound like ice rubbing against ice filled the ice cave, causing more cracks to appear on the ice surface. More than one, Lin Mo&#x27;s heart pounded wildly. Without hesitation, he turned and ran towards the entrance tunnel. The space here was too cramped.</p>
<p>If he were trapped or the ice cave collapsed, he would surely die. The sounds of ice cracking and rustling followed closely behind him. He scrambled into the narrow tunnel, climbing upwards with all his might. He used his dagger and stone axe to carve deep marks into the ice wall for leverage. Just as he was about to burst out of the crevice, his foot suddenly gave way.</p>
<p>A section of ice steps collapsed. He slid downwards. At the critical moment, he stabbed the dagger into the ice wall on the side with his backhand, stopping his slide, but his body was suspended in the air with pale tentacles breaking through the ice right under his feet. He could see the mouth parts wriggling at the tips of those tentacles and smell a strange odor mixed with decay and cold. &quot;Don&#x27;t panic,&quot; he gritted his teeth and reached for the simple crossbow at his waist with his other hand.</p>
<p>It was already loaded with arrows when he came down to make climbing easier. He painstakingly adjusted the angle, aimed at the spot below, where the ice was most concentrated and the rustling sound was loudest, and pulled the trigger. Whoosh! Thud! The wooden arrow pierced the ice crevice. It&#x27;s unclear whether it hit its mark, but the movement below noticeably paused. Taking advantage of the opportunity, he braced his feet against the ice wall, forcefully pulled out the dagger, and leaped upwards using both hands and feet.</p>
<p>Finally, just as another tentacle was about to wrap around his ankle, he burst out of the crevice and tumbled onto the ice outside. Still shaken, he looked back and saw a pale shadow moving vaguely in the crack, but seemed to be affected by the light and temperature outside. It was - 10° C outside, and it was probably even lower inside the cave, so it did not chase after it and slowly retreated back inside. He slumped onto the ice, panting heavily, white steam billowing around him. The brush with death had left his back soaked in cold sweat, now chilly in a biting wind.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t get the key, and they almost lost their lives. No, we can&#x27;t give up like this. Are those frost eating insects afraid of light? Or perhaps afraid of the relatively high temperatures outside? They didn&#x27;t chase after us through the crack just now. He calmed down and observed his surroundings. Seeing the backpack and tools scattered to the side, an idea flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>He reorganized his equipment, gathered all the remaining tar with shavings and adal vice, and wrapped them in oil cloth to form several small balls. Then he approached the crevice again, lit one of the oil cloth balls, and threw it in forcefully. The fireball rolled into the darkness, illuminating the ice tunnel, accompanied by hissing sounds of burning and a sharper, more rapid rustling. The frost eating insects seemed to be terrified of the flames and heat, retreating even deeper. Efficient Linmo followed the same method, throwing in a burning oilcloth ball every few meters, forcibly creating a passage with a fire light and heat and descending into the ice cave again.</p>
<p>This time, the ice cave was filled with the smell of burning and a faint warmth, relatively speaking. The frost eating insects on the ice walls were nowhere to be seen, probably hiding deeper inside. He dared not delay, rushing to the ice wall and striking it swiftly and powerfully with his stone axe. Soon the ice broke, and the ancient looking bronze key with snowflake-shaped dents on its handle fell out, feeling cold and heavy to the touch. Without taking a closer look, he stuffed the key into his pocket, turned, and ran, kicking away the remaining burning debris along the way to prevent any possible return of the frost eaters.</p>
<p>He burst through the crevice and it was already broad daylight outside. Without looking back, he ran to the ice sled, untied the mooring ropes, hoisted the sail, and sped off back the way he had come. Only after leaving ice kisscliffe for several kilome and confirming that nothing was chasing him, did he relax his tense nerves and take out the bronze key to examine it carefully. Besides the snowflake shaped dents, the key surface is also engraved with fine wavelike patterns, and it has a strange warmth to the touch, which is completely out of place with the surrounding extreme cold. Just as his fingertips brushed across the indentation in the snowflakes, another unexpected event occurred.</p>
<p>The key suddenly became scorching hot. The snowflake-shaped indentation glowed with a soft blue light. A surge of information forcefully flooded his mind. It wasn&#x27;t words, but a series of dynamic images and structural diagrams. A streamlined sailboat with triangular sails and a unique ramming head sailing steadily through the raging waves.</p>
<p>The complex keel and hole structure decomposed and reassembled. Finally, the light condensed, transforming into a drawing, radiating a pale golden glow, deeply imprinted in the depths of his consciousness. obtained complete crafting blueprints for storm sailboat. Soulbound host detected obtaining the complete blueprint directly through exploration, triggering a 100x boost boost. Now the storm ship, it really is it.</p>
<p>The key mentioned in the outline, enabling him to be the first to reach level five island and obtain the title of king of the storm. Suppressing his excitement, Leno was silently chanted in his mind. amplification. Instantly, a 100 physical blueprints radiating the same pale golden light appeared in the bracelet storage space. Each one meticulously recorded every detail of the stormship&#x27;s construction, from the keel to the rigging, requiring an astronomical amount of materials.</p>
<p>But at this moment, these blueprints represented limitless possibilities. He gripped the still warm bronze key and glanced back at the receding cliff face which resembled a frozen behemoth. Beneath the icy cliff lies more than just a key is also a ticket to a new era. He looked toward his island, his eyes blazing with an unprecedented light. The cold wave will eventually pass and his ship is about to set sail.</p>
<p>Chapter 15. The true intentions are revealed. Bartering is employed as the ice sled glided back to the vicinity of his island. Dusk was approaching. Lynn Mo was almost frozen, stiff, his limbs numb and rigid.</p>
<p>Each breath accompanied by a stinging pain in his lungs. But clutching the bronze key, now cold, but seemingly carrying some invisible weight, and with a crystal clear structural diagram of the storm sailboat, in his mind, a burning fire blazed within him. It took him a great deal of effort to drag the ice sled ashore and cover it with an oil cloth. He stumbled into the warm, cozy inner room. the heat from the fire almost making him dizzy.</p>
<p>He took off his heavy gear, gulped down several mouthfuls of warm water, and curled up in the animal skin for a while before he felt his blood begin to flow again. Once his body had recovered slightly, he couldn&#x27;t wait to delve into his consciousness and examine the blueprint once more. Complex, extremely complex. It was a world apart from the rudimentary wooden rafts and ice sleds he had built before. The blueprints were outrageously detailed.</p>
<p>From a most crucial element, the keel material, which required special treatment, requiring hardwood over a hundred years old, or the skeleton of some deep sea behemoth, to the curvature and splicing method of each hole plate. From the cutting and sewing requirement to the triangular main sail and formass sail requiring high tenacity canvas, to the complex pulley system and cable system requiring numerous metal components and special ropes. There were also the rudder, ram, and even the reserve location for the energy core and basic rune inlay slots mentioned at the end of the blueprints that clearly involved areas he currently couldn&#x27;t comprehend at all. The list of materials was astronomical. There were thousands of pieces of wood, hundreds of pieces of metal, and various sizes of ropes, canvas, special adhesives, and waterproof coatings.</p>
<p>He had never even heard of many of these materials before and they were marked with can be replaced by XX performance reduced. This is not a project that one person or even an ordinary team could complete in a short period of time. The requirements for the blueprints were so high that they were practically designed for a collective with complete logistical and industrial capabilities. But Lynn Mo&#x27;s growth rate was 100fold. He doesn&#x27;t need to collect a single material.</p>
<p>He needs to collect the type that material represents. Once he directly obtains one of those materials through any means, he will have 100. The key lies in how you obtain the first one. It must be obtained directly by personally gathering resources, fishing for it, obtaining it as a drop from a monster, or like in this exploration, directly acquiring the blueprint. Finished products purchased through trading will not benefit from the enhancement.</p>
<p>This means that he had to personally participate in the first acquisition process of almost all the core materials. It&#x27;s impossible for him to do everything himself. He needs strategy. He needs agents. And he needs to leverage the power of the entire market.</p>
<p>He first listed the most basic but in- demand materials from the blueprints. Standard timber, ordinary stone, fiber, rope, iron ingots, and copper ingots. He could purchase the first batch of these through large-scale transactions and then rely on a 100fold increase to acquire a massive basic reserve. However, obtaining metal ingots, especially the first iron or copper ingot, might require special channels because most of the metals circulating the market is currently in fragments with very few ingots. Then there are the high-end materials, century old hardwood, high strength canvas, refined tar, deep sea beast senue, and monster crystal cores.</p>
<p>These either require exploring specific locations, hunting powerful creatures, or special processing techniques, and each one is extremely difficult to obtain. Finally, there are those unheard of materials. Star patterned steel, the stomach pouch of a basil whale, the tail feathers of a storm kite, and the condensation of tranquil seaweed. These are estimated to exist only in legends or in extremely dangerous and special areas. The task is arduous and the road ahead is long.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo composed himself and began the first step to digest the gains from the trip to Ice Kiss Cliff and to strengthen himself. He first contacted Sue Chanchan and sent her a message. I have returned safely and retrieve the items. Your perception was a great help accurately warning of the threat beneath the ice. The promised advanced fuel pack and improved Stow blueprints will be delivered to the designated coordinates later.</p>
<p>Additionally, as extra thanks, I&#x27;m including a high efficiency hot drink recipe. Such Chian replied quickly, her tone filled with relief. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re back safe and sound. Don&#x27;t take such risks in places like Ice Kiss Cliff next time. I urgently need the fuel and blueprints.</p>
<p>Thank you. I&#x27;ll also accept the formula. Consider it a favor I owe you. Also, the cold wave seems to be weakening and the abnormal heat source in the southeast is becoming clearer. Perhaps we can go and investigate after the cold wave passes.</p>
<p>Take care to rest and recuperate. After ending the communication, Linmo packed the promised supplies and sent them out anonymously. Such Chanchians favor and continuous intelligence capabilities were invaluable, albeit intangible assets. Next, he tallied up the other spoils of the expedition. Besides the key and blueprints, the frostworm attack had left behind some trophies, several pieces of pale white tentacles he had cut off or charred.</p>
<p>These fragments were cold to the touch, tough as rubber, and emitted a faint chill. He didn&#x27;t know what they were for, but he&#x27;d keep them for now. Then he turned his attention to the real challenge, gathering materials for the stormship. Instead of using the overly conspicuous identity of Jay, he used a business anonymous account that was used to contact Chen Duo Duo as well as two other backup accounts. First, he gave Chen Duo Duo a series of complex instructions.</p>
<p>One, spreading the word and testing the waters. In several active trading sub channels, it is posted that an anonymous big shot, who could be an admirer or subordinate of Jay, is raising funds for basic materials for an epic project and is buying standard timber, stone, fiber, and ordinary rope in unlimited quantities for a long period of time at a price 10% higher than a market price, but with quality requirements and can pay in various ways, including food, freshwater, and semi finished tools. Two key breakthrough asterisk. Utilize all resources and connections to locate and acquire the first standard iron ingot and the first standard copper ingot at any cost but discreetly. Spreading false information can help confuse the public.</p>
<p>Three, intelligence gathering. Purchase all information at high prices regarding ancient trees over 100 years old, originating sites of special high strength fabrics, spots of large marine animals, and clues to rare mineral veins. regardless of its authenticity and filter it first. Four, market disruption. While acquiring basic materials, release previously stockpiled and surplus winter supplies such as intermediate grade fur and ordinary fuel in small batches in multiple batches in exchange for more durable metal parts or rare items, further recovering resources and cooling down the market to prevent material prices from soaring too fast due to his acquisitions.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo quickly understood the intention and replied, &quot;Understood. We can start acquiring basic materials immediately using the groceries we earned earlier to pay for them, thus concealing our true objective. Iron and copper ingots are a bit troublesome. I heard that the Stonemason Brotherhood has some, but they only exchange them for knowledge or relic information.&quot; The know-it-all intelligence operative about large sea monsters seemed to have boasted a few days ago that he knew where to find the shed skin of a giant squid. I&#x27;ll go and give him another nudge.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, Lynn Emmo, pondered. This mysterious organization was indeed beginning to surface. We can make contact first, testing their interests. We can use the scraps of information we have about the eternal frost path, not the core details to exchange for it. As for the know-it-all, give them a little something, but verify it first.</p>
<p>Understood? Chin Duo Duo went off with great enthusiasm. After arranging things for Chien Duo Duo, Lynn Mo began to take action himself. Using another anonymous account, he directly contacted several survivors who had demonstrated professionalism or special skills in previous transactions. For example, one with the ID Old Carpenter who was skilled at handling wood. One named Furnace Jeang who seemed to have expertise in metal smelting and another named Weaver who had shown off her homemade coarse cloth in the channel.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo established initial contact with them on the condition of long-term cooperation and technical support in exchange for a stable supply of materials and raised several specific technical problems in material processing for consultation such as how to quickly air dry large logs without cracking, how to refine relatively pure iron under rudimentary conditions, and how to weave fabrics that are both lightweight and durable. He paid them some food or tools as a consultation fee. He doesn&#x27;t need a perfect answer immediately. He&#x27;s casting a wide net, learning and accumulating necessary knowledge. These artisans may become his technical advisers or junior processors in the future.</p>
<p>Just as he was busy weaving this invisible network of resources and intelligence, an urgent private message from Dragon Soul, Steel Gun shattered his immersive planning. Lynmo, do they know this alternate account corresponds to Jay or is it just a guess? Emergency. We have detected the main fleet of Wings of Freedom Gathering with their target suspected to be the area you are in. SH739. They have likely obtained intelligence about your large-scale transactions during the cold wave and your suspected possession of high value items, possibly referring to the source of winter supplies or your trip to Ice Kisscliffe.</p>
<p>Caesar is personally leading the team. Their intentions are hostile. We suggest you immediately go in a hiding or move to the safe coordinates we provide. Dragon soul can provide you with temporary shelter. Wings of liberty.</p>
<p>Caesar himself has arrived. Lynmo&#x27;s eyes suddenly turned icy cold. Sure enough, the tallest tree in the forest catches the most wind. His recent activity, especially his near monopoly on commodity trading during the cold wave finally attracted the wolves. Hide transfer to the protection of the dragon soul.</p>
<p>that would be tanamount to handing your fate over to someone else and would also expose more to trump cards. He looked at the phantom of the sailboat standing firm in the storm in his mind and then at his own warm but fragile island. The storm came sooner than he had anticipated. But wasn&#x27;t this ship born to conquer storms? He replied to Dragon Soul Steel Gun, &quot;Thanks for the warning. I am prepared.</p>
<p>In addition, I need the specific size, composition, and possible landing points of the Wings of Freedom Fleet. In exchange, I could provide a predictive analysis of the possible forms of the second wave of the marine invasion based on in-depth analysis of the first video recording, as well as a preliminary speculation on the resource point regeneration patterns after the cold wave. What he wanted wasn&#x27;t protection, but intelligence. He wanted to earn the support of his allies through his own value, not through handouts. Dragon&#x27;s soul steel gun paused for a moment before replying, &quot;I can give you the intelligence.&quot; But Caesar possesses the S-rank combat talent, Thunderous Fury, making him extremely powerful individually.</p>
<p>His core fleet is also equipped with far superior gear compared to ordinary survivors. Are you sure you want to confront him head-on? Not a direct confrontation, Lynn Emmo typed his reply, his gaze sweeping over the neatly stacked barricades and fishing grounds in the corner, as well as the extremely complex blueprints for the storm sailboat in his mind. It teaches them that some things cannot be taken simply by having a large number of people. By the way, let them be the first contributors of my ship building materials. Chapter 16, defending against the enemy in the icy sea.</p>
<p>An initial victory. The wings of Freedom&#x27;s fleet appeared on the horizon at noon the following day. It wasn&#x27;t the imposing fleet Lynn Mo had imagined, but rather a mixed group of five ships of varying sizes and styles. The largest was a dilapidated twomasted sailing ship. Its hole patched upon patched, but its sails were intact.</p>
<p>It was likely their flagship. Of the other four, two were in large versions of the rafts Lynn Mo had seen before, but with added rudimentary cabins and sails, while the other two were bizarre ships pieced together from various floating objects, looking as if they might fall apart at any moment. Even so, in this frozen sea where most survivors are still struggling with canoes and tattered rafts, such a fleet is enough to create an overwhelming deterrent. Lyn Mo stood behind a makeshift shelter made of ice and stones at the edge of the island, calmly observing through his homemade moninocular telescope, two glass lenses with different focal lengths, and a bamboo tube. The fleet stopped about a kilometer west of his island, seemingly wary of the ice flows and reefs near the shore.</p>
<p>At the bow of the largest two-masted sailing ship stood a tall figure in a heavy fur coat. His blonde hair still striking against the grayish sky. It was Caesar. Several men stood beside him pointing and gesturing clearly observing Lin Mos island. Lyn Mo&#x27;s island reinforced and camouflaged by the cold wave looked unremarkable.</p>
<p>The shack were covered with tarpollins and animal hides blending in with the ice. The fishing grounds were also disguised. Only the deliberately exposed, seemingly randomly placed barricades and a few conspicuous piles of supplies, actually traps and bait, indicated that someone lived there and had some reserves. He was waiting, waiting for the other party to make the first move. Sure enough, soon after, a smaller sandpan-like boat separated from the fleet, carrying three people who were carefully rowing around the ice flows towards the island.</p>
<p>They were there to probe. Lynn Emmo didn&#x27;t move. He had already marked the thinnest points in the ice around the island and set up some simple underwater traps sharpened wooden stakes connected by ropes hidden under the ice which would spring up and pierce the bottom of the boat when triggered. But these traps were only effective against small boats. The three people in the sandpan were very cautious, moving slowly and constantly probing the thickness of the ice with a long pole.</p>
<p>They circled around a small section of the ice before choosing a gap that appeared to be thicker and had no barricades blocking their way. Just as the sandpan was about to reach the shore, a sudden change occurred. Crack. The ice shattered. It wasn&#x27;t a trap set by Lyn Mo, but rather the ice itself wasn&#x27;t thick enough to withstand the weight of the sandpan and the combined trampling of the three people.</p>
<p>Amid cries of alarm, the sand pan tilted to one side and two people fell into the water. Instantly engulfed by the icy cold, the remaining person desperately clung to the gunnel, trying to stabilize the boat. Linmo&#x27;s eyes were cold, devoid of any sympathy. Having chosen plunder, one must bear the consequences. He did not attack the person who had fallen into the water.</p>
<p>The icy seawater itself was a deadly weapon. A commotion arose from the fleet in the distance, but no immediate rescue was undertaken. Caesar appeared to be observing. The two people who fell into the water struggled, but their movements quickly slowed as their body temperature rapidly decreased. The one who grabbed the gunnel tried to pull his companion out, but he was too weak.</p>
<p>Finally, the sandpan capsized and all three fell into the water. After a few thrashings, they stopped moving and drifted slowly away with the ice flows. The first attempt ended with the Wings of Liberty losing three members. It was brutal, but an effective deterrent. Linimone knew that the real attack was coming.</p>
<p>Sure enough, two larger pointed boats with ironplated bottoms, possibly salvaged from other parts, were lowered from the brigant. Each boat carried six or seven men armed with a variety of weapons, harpoons, machetes, and even a homemade crossbow. Caesar himself boarded one of the boats, standing at the bow, his face ashen. The two ships stopped probing and headed straight for Lin Moe&#x27;s designated main landing point, which appeared flat, but was actually covered by barricades, ice pits he had dug, and trip wires he had set up. The boat was fast, its bow reinforced with iron, easily smashing through the thin ice at the edge, gliding along the eyes for a while before coming to a stop.</p>
<p>A dozen men yelled and jumped off the boat, brandishing their weapons as they rushed through the gap between the barricades. Now Lin Mo emerged from behind cover. His simple crossbow already cocked. The muscle memory from his rudimentary archery skills allowed him to move smoothly and steadily. Swoosh.</p>
<p>Swoosh. Swoosh. Three wooden arrows were fired in quick succession. Their target wasn&#x27;t the people charging at the front, but rather their feet. Puff, puff, puff.</p>
<p>The wooden arrow pierced the ice, triggering a trap. He had set several flexible hardwood logs bent and fixed under the ice, sprang up and swept across with sharp stone fragments. Ah, my leg. The four or five people at the front were caught off guard and cut their legs and feet by the stone fragments. They fell down with screams and their formation was immediately disrupted.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an ambush. Find cover, someone shouted. But what cover could be found on the bare ice except for a few piles of supplies that Lynn and Mo had deliberately left behind. Several people instinctively rushed towards the nearest pile of supplies, trying to hide behind it. Lynmo&#x27;s lips curled into a cold smile as he pulled the trigger of the crossbow again.</p>
<p>This time, the arrow hit the supply pile. Boom! The tar with scraps and adal vise he had buried under the supplies were ignited, instantly bursting into a small fire and thick smoke. Although it did not cause much damage, the sudden explosion and fire made the wings of freedom even more panicked. thinking it was some kind of powerful weapon. Don&#x27;t panic.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s all alone. Archers suppress him. Caesar&#x27;s roar rang out. He didn&#x27;t charge in immediately, but instead directed from the rear. The enemy&#x27;s homemade crossbow fired an arrow in Lin Moe&#x27;s general direction, which landed crookedly on the ice in front of the cover, posing no threat whatsoever.</p>
<p>But Lin and Mo had already retreated behind cover. What he wanted was to create chaos. And by time, he quickly moved to another pre-selected firing position where the angle was better and he could see some of the enemies trying to flank him. Raised the crossbow again, aim, and fire. Another person was shot in the thigh with an arrow and fell to the ground screaming.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo was like a ghost on the ice field. He used his familiarity with the terrain and the ice tunnels he had dug in advance, covered with a thin layer of ice and snow, to move quickly between different bunkers. Each time he appeared, he would shoot one or two arrows. He did not seek to kill the enemy, but only to injure them and create panic. The wings of Liberty were stunned.</p>
<p>They outnumbered the crew, but crammed into the narrow landing zone. They were helpless against the unpredictable barrage of arrows and the unknown number of traps. Even Caesar&#x27;s roar couldn&#x27;t immediately turn the tide. Finally, Caesar could no longer restrain himself. &quot;Useless trash! Get out of the way!&quot; He roared, shoving aside his men who were blocking his path and strode forward.</p>
<p>Tiny crackles of electricity flickered around him, and the air crackled softly. Srra talent, thunderous fury. Lynn Mo&#x27;s eyes narrowed, and he immediately aimed at Caesar and fired an arrow. Caesar didn&#x27;t even look at it and simply waved his hand. Crack.</p>
<p>The wooden arrow was shattered by a leaping arc of electricity when it was still half a foot away from his arm. &quot;Found you,&quot; Caesar grinned maliciously, his gaze locking onto the spot where Lynn Mo had just appeared. He clenched his fists and a much thicker blue white arc of electricity condensed in his palms, emitting a chilling buzz, ready to be unleashed. A warning screamed in Lynmo&#x27;s mind. He couldn&#x27;t take it head-on.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he rolled into the pre-prepared ice ditch beside him. Almost simultaneously, a thick arc of electricity shot out and struck the bunker where Linmo had just been standing. Boom! Ice and rubble flew everywhere. A large gap was blasted open in the bunker made of ice and stones. Sparks flew and a large area of ice melted.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s incredibly powerful. If you get hit, you&#x27;ll be crippled or killed. Limo climbed out of the icy ditch. still shaken. But he didn&#x27;t stop moving, continuing to shift between the bunkers while shouting, &quot;Caesar, is that all you&#x27;ve got? A talent for missing shots? What&#x27;s the difference between you and a firework?&quot; He wanted to provoke Caesar, make him lose his mind, and deplete his strength.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re asking for death.&quot; Caesar was indeed enraged, and another arc of electricity shot out, hitting the ice surface near Linmo and blasting a large crater. Ice shards flew everywhere, but Linmo had already dodged in advance and at his landing spot. Don&#x27;t let him get away. Caesar roared behind him. Several henchmen armed with harpoons and machetes attempted to surround them.</p>
<p>Lyno fired another arrow, forcing the two back. But Caesar&#x27;s continuous barrage of electric arcs made his space for dodging smaller and smaller, and his cover was destroyed one by one. The situation is critical. Lynn Mo&#x27;s gaze swept over the two pointed ships of the Wings of Liberty in the distance and then looked at his subordinates who dared not get too close because of Caesar&#x27;s indiscriminate bombardment. An adventurous plan flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>He feigned exhaustion and ran toward the other side of the island in what appeared to be an escape route where his ice sled was parked. He&#x27;s trying to run chase him. Upon seeing this, Caesar immediately led his men in pursuit, believing that Lin Mo was about to escape on an ice sled. Lyn Mo ran to the ice sled, but instead of getting on, he gave it a hard push. Using its momentum, the ice sled glided toward the two pointed boats.</p>
<p>Honor were the last few bags of tarwood chips and adal vice that he had prepared beforehand, as well as several Molotov cocktails sealed in earthnware jars and filled with animal fat. Shoot that sled, Lyn Mo shouted to Caesar while simultaneously drawing his bow and firing a rocket with an oil soaked cloth strip attached toward the ice in front of the ice sled. The rocket ignited the tar and sawdust he had scattered on the ice beforehand, and a line of fire quickly spread toward the approaching ice sled. Caesar instinctively unleashed an arc of electricity at the ice sled. Boom! An electric arc struck burning tarcovered sawdust, triggering a violent explosion.</p>
<p>The clay pot shattered and animal fat ignited, transforming into a massive fireball that engulfed the ice sled and the surrounding ice. And the direction the ice sled was gliding was precisely those two pointed boats. The flames and the shock wave from the explosion affected the ship. Although it didn&#x27;t directly ignite, the intense heat and shock wave caused the wings of Freedom members on board to scream and scatter, throwing their formation into disarray. More importantly, the violent explosion and tremors caused the ice surface, which was already fragile due to the collision of ships and stacking of heavy objects to emit a tooth grinding continuous cracking sound.</p>
<p>KC bomb large sections of ice collapsed. Two pointed boats and the few people on board who hadn&#x27;t yet disembarked along with the wreckage of the ice sled fell into the icy sea. No. Caesar&#x27;s eyes widened in horror. Those two ships were crucial to their transportation and a significant part of their fighting force.</p>
<p>This is exactly the effect Lynn Mo wanted. Destroy their ship and they&#x27;ll become an isolated army trapped on this ice island. He took the opportunity to disappear back into the ruins and smoke. Caesar was furious, but his remaining men were terrified, having lost their ships and found themselves an unfamiliar surroundings, facing a cunning and ruthless opponent, they had lost their will to fight. Retreat.</p>
<p>Retreat to the big ship first. Although Caesar was unwilling, he was still rational and knew that further entanglement would result in greater losses. The eight or nine survivors, including the injured, helped each other and stumbled back along the broken ice, running back in the direction they had come from. Lynamo did not give chase. He stood at the edge of the ruins, watching them flee into the distance.</p>
<p>We won with his own strength, the advantage of terrain, and preparation. He repelled the raid by the wings of freedom, destroyed two of their ships, and killed or wounded nearly 10 people. But he also paid a price. Several bunkers were destroyed. The ice sled was gone and some traps were exposed.</p>
<p>More importantly, he forged a deep and irreconcilable enmity with the wings of Liberty and Caesar. However, Lynn Emmo didn&#x27;t care. In this sea, weakness is the original sin. He walked to the collapsed ice and looked at the shipwrecks, bodies, weapons, tools, and packages floating in the sea. Spoils of war.</p>
<p>He spent some time using a hook and a net to retrieve everything he could. a few harpoons and machetes that were still in relatively good condition. Some metal parts and tools. Several soaked packages contained frozen bread, jerky, and his eyes lit up two metal ingots carefully wrapped in oil cloth. One was iron gray, the other dark red.</p>
<p>Iron ingots, copper ingots. The first piece was obtained just like that. Although it was stained with blood, it didn&#x27;t matter. There are also some scattered materials, rope, scraps of canvas, and a few pieces of animal hide. Most importantly, he found a palmsiz hardcover notebook wrapped in a waterproof leather case in the wreckage of Caesar&#x27;s pointed ship.</p>
<p>Opening it, what you find isn&#x27;t a diary, but rather a hastily drawn map, resource point markers, personnel lists, and transaction records, a record of Wings of Liberty&#x27;s activities, and intelligence summaries in and around SH 739. priceless treasure. Lynn Mo carefully put away the notebook and metal ingots, cleaned up the battlefield traces, and pushed the corpse into the deep sea. Back in a slightly better shed, he lit the fire and began to take stock of all the hardest materials, weapons, intelligence, especially those two metal ingots and that notebook. The construction of the storm ship has taken its most solid first step.</p>
<p>After this battle, the infamous name of the anonymous J will surely spread rapidly throughout this sea area as the remnants of the wings of Freedom flee back. Fear can sometimes be more effective at keeping people at a distance than friendliness. He looked into the distance. The wings of Freedom Fleet had already sailed away and disappeared into the gray sea and sky. But Lyno knew they would come back.</p>
<p>Next time it might not be a test, but a full-scale revenge. He has to be faster, become stronger quickly, and build that ship that can conquer the storm. Chapter 17. Secrets of the notebook. Route map revealed.</p>
<p>The embers of the battle cooled completely in the wind. Linmo spent most of the day clearing the island, repairing the bunkers and ice surfaces bombarded by Caesar&#x27;s electric arcs. The bodies of the wings of freedom members had long since sunk into the deep sea, becoming insignificant footnotes to this icy landscape. Along with the shattered shipwrecks, the blood stains were covered by ice and snow, and the traces of the battle gradually blurred. Only the faint smell of burnt blood lingering in the air and the several conspicuous craters on the island reminded people of what had just happened.</p>
<p>Lyno didn&#x27;t care about these superficial wounds. He was more concerned with the tangible gains. Back in a relatively intact hut, the fire in the hearth dispelled the bone chilling cold. He spread the hardcover notebook he had obtained from Caesar&#x27;s ship out on the stone table covered with animal hides. The notebook&#x27;s cover was made of some kind of thick tanned deep sea fish skin.</p>
<p>Its edges badly worn and stained with black and blood and salt. Opening the title page, there was no name, only a slogan hastily written in charcoal. The law of the jungle prevails. Caesar. The handwriting is flamboyant and forceful, penetrating the paper.</p>
<p>Lynmo flipped through the page expressionlessly. The following content was the important part. The first few dozen pages are like a nautical log, starting roughly a month after the global voyage. They record how Caesar awakened his S-rank talent, thunderous fury, how he uses overwhelming force to subdue his first group of followers, how he plundered the weak, consolidated resources, and gradually built Wings of Liberty. The log is filled with accounts of the bloody suppression of rebels and the ruthless distribution of spoils of war, including supplies and personnel, revealing a naked jungle law and a lust for power.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo quickly scan the screen, capturing key information. The Wings of Liberty currently has about 30 core members and over a 100 peripheral followers scattered across several outpost islands in the SH700 to SH 800 region. They control at least three known small resource points. A shallow shell rich in iron sand, a reef area with high oyster yields, and an island where special resin can be harvested regularly. Caesar&#x27;s individual combat prowess is emphasized, but the log also subtly mentions that overuse of thunder fury can strain the body and require time to recover.</p>
<p>This is a potential weakness. After you get past these, the content that follows will be even more valuable. It is a handdrawn nautical chart. It&#x27;s much more complete than the fragments lin mo obtained from the reef area. It covers most of the sea area from SH 700 to SH 800 and even slightly extends beyond the boundaries.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s marked with different symbols and colors. A red cross indicates a dangerous area with small print indicating sea beast nest, abnormal vortex, or mysterious fog zone. Blue circles represent resource points including timber islands, quaries, fishing grounds, and freshwater springs. Black triangle represents other known islands occupied by strong survivors or forces. Sometimes a strength assessment or relationship note is marked next to it such as hostile tradable to be observed.</p>
<p>Green dash line presumes safe flight path. There are also some locations marked with special symbols such as keys, treasure chests, and question marks, which clearly represent unknown or secrets that need to be explored. Lynmo&#x27;s gaze was fixed on a route marked with a striking gold dotted line. This route started from the edge of the SH739 area, meandered southeast, passed through a dangerous zone marked turbulent sea, and finally pointed to a location marked with a gold treasure chest symbol. Next to which were written three words, eye of the storm.</p>
<p>the eye of a storm. Could it be? He immediately thought of the stormship blueprints he had obtained. The name and characteristics of the blueprints were all closely related to storms. Could this eye of the storm be related to the construction of the storm ship or to something more important? Is Caesar also looking for this place? And has he already discovered part of the route? Lynmo&#x27;s heart raced slightly. He carefully studied the golden route.</p>
<p>Several intermediate nodes and precautions were marked on the route. Bus number seven with an abandoned lighthouse where you can temporarily dock. Crossing the turbulency requires specific whole strength and wind and wave resistance and the outer edge of the eye of the storm has continuous thunderstorms and turbulence and there may be guardian creatures or ruins. The requirements are very high and the risks are extremely great. But the mark of the golden treasure chest means that in Caesar&#x27;s eyes its value is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Lynn M and Mo etched this route firmly into his mind. This might be the first challenge he would face after building the storm ship. Continuing to flip through the notebook, there were some scattered records at the back. Contacts with other regional forces, mostly conflicts, scattered intelligence about the Stonemason Brotherhood, characterized as mysterious war avoiding knowledge first fear and hostility towards the dragon soul and a few speculations and bounty records about Jay. In recent pages, Caesar wrote in bold, &quot;Jay confirmed to be hiding in area SH 739, suspected of possessing efficient resource acquisition channels and advanced defense technology.</p>
<p>Initial contact failed, resulting in losses of personnel and ships. A reassessment is necessary. Forces must be regrouped to capture it. Its island may hold significant secrets or treasure.&quot; Seeing this, Lynmo&#x27;s eyes grew even colder. Sure enough, Caesar wouldn&#x27;t let this go easily.</p>
<p>Next time, he might send his full force. He closed the notebook, his fingertips tapping on a rough cover. The value of intelligence can sometimes surpass that of a thousand troops. This notebook gave him an unprecedentedly clear understanding of the wings of freedom&#x27;s inner workings, the landscape of the surrounding waters, and the potential dangers and opportunities. Now, the advantage is on his side.</p>
<p>He needs to take advantage of this information gap and race against time. First, the construction of a storm ship must be accelerated. The eye of the storm indicated by the golden route is likely the key or at least contains important resources that could speed up construction. He contacted Shin Duo Duo and shared some information about resource points from his notebook key and sensitive content omitted, instructing him, adjust the acquisition strategy. Focus on acquiring specialty materials from these locations at prices 15% higher than a market price.</p>
<p>At the same time, spread vague and dangerous rumors about Restless Sea and Eye of the Storm on several secondary channels. Mixing truth and falsehood to confuse the public, especially targeting Wings of Freedom&#x27;s potential information gathering channels. Shiendo Duo was shocked by the detail of the intelligence, but immediately understood. Understood. Use the intelligence advantage to wage an information war, disrupt the opponent&#x27;s judgment, and at the same time accurately acquire the resources we need.</p>
<p>Brilliant. In addition, the first batch of standard timber and stone you requested have been gathered through decentralized acquisitions and can be delivered at any time. Very good. I&#x27;ll send you the delivery location and time separately. Be careful.</p>
<p>Wings of Liberty may increase monitoring of the movement of supplies in the near future. Lynn Emmo reminded him, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. Our downline network is already taking shape. It&#x27;s all one-way communication, making it very difficult to trace.&quot; Chandu Duo said confidently. After ending the call, Linmo sent Su Chian another message.</p>
<p>The attackers have retreated. I received some intelligence about the area that might be associated with the abnormal heat source in the southeast. It seems to be called Restless Sea and Eye of the Storm. Have you heard of them? Sue Chanchian replied quickly with surprise. Where did you get these names? Restless Sea is vaguely recorded in my inherited knowledge.</p>
<p>It said that the ocean currents in that area are turbulent. The weather is unpredictable and there are often abnormal electromagnetic phenomena. It&#x27;s a no navigation zone. I haven&#x27;t heard of Eye of the Storm, but the name sounds like the core of the restless sea. If the abnormal heat source is there, it might not be geothermal, but some kind of energy convergence or release phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s dangerous, but it might also contain huge opportunities. Do you want to go just to find out first? The construction of a storm ship requires a lot of special materials, and that might be a clue. Lynn Mo didn&#x27;t completely hide anything. Suchan was silent for a moment, then sent a message. Heart of the ocean is sensitive to energy.</p>
<p>if you really decide to go and can ensure that your vehicle is sturdy enough. I can try to provide more accurate sensing and warnings as we approach. But the prerequisite is that you must have a boat that can withstand extreme sea conditions and potential energy impacts. Your current raft won&#x27;t do. This was a subtle way of reminding him of the risks while also implicitly expressing a willingness to offer assistance.</p>
<p>Understand? I will build a ship, Linmo replied, then paused and added, &quot;Thank you, Dot.&quot; You&#x27;re welcome. The cold wave is receding rapidly, and the melting ice will bring new ocean current changes and rising water levels. Be sure to reinforce the edges of your island. Also, Lie Kuay&#x27;s remnants have completely scattered. Some have joined the Wings of Freedom, and someone to trade supplies with me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll keep them hanging on as he said. Such Chian changed the subject. Okay, Wings of Freedom may be making some big moves soon, so be careful and stay in touch. Lynn Emmo ended the conversation. After finishing these tasks, Lynn Emmo walked out of the shed.</p>
<p>As evening approached, the cold wind persisted, though was noticeably weaker than in the previous days. In the distance on the sea, grayish white ice flows began to loosen, colliding with each other and making a continuous cracking sound. The cold wave is really coming to an end. As the ice melts, the suppressed forces, the restless sea monsters, and the countless secrets and dangers hidden beneath the waves will all become active again. He looked southeast with a vast deep blue sea and the eye of the storm lay.</p>
<p>Then he looked at the heavy notebook in his hand. Finally, his gaze returned to his own 10 square meter island, which had weathered storms, cold waves, and bloody battles. from six square meters to 10 square meters. From having nothing to having some savings, from being unknown to gaining a reputation for infamy. The next step is to move from this small area to the vast raging sea.</p>
<p>The sailboat blueprints in his hand, the golden route in his mind, and the bronze key in his pocket with a foundation for his voyage. He turned and went back into the shed, spread out a new animal hide by the fire, and began to compile a list of the core materials that needed to be addressed most urgently based on the storm ship blueprints. High strength whole timber as the main material for the keel and the main sail fabric forming the prototype of the energy core. One by one, item by item, the sound of ice cracking outside the window seemed to be striking a rapid drum beat as a prelude to a new era. Lynn Emmo picked up the charcoal pencil and wrote four characters heavily on the tip of the animal hide.</p>
<p>Raised the sails and set sail. Chapter 18. The pinnacle of level 5, King of the Storm. The seventh day of check-in was completed in the soft morning light. Ding.</p>
<p>Sign in successful. Congratulations. You have received one standard iron ingot and one standard copper ingot. A flash of light and 100fold amplification activated. 100 iron ingots and 100 copper ingots appeared in the bracelet space, joining the two previously obtained from the wings of freedom, instantly making the metal reserves considerable.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo calmly gazed at the cold metal blocks. Iron and copper were the basic structural materials for building the storm ship and also crucial for upgrading the island to higher levels and constructing more complex facilities. He now possessed 102 iron ingots and 102 copper ingots. If he extrapolated from the previous requirement of 10 foundation stones for upgrading a level one island, the materials needed to upgrade to level five would be astronomical. However, he might have already gathered the first most crucial portion of the core metal materials.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t attempt to upgrade immediately. The system hadn&#x27;t yet provided information on what materials were needed to upgrade the island from level one to level two. He needed to trigger that condition first. Upon opening the bracelet, the island information interface displays. Island level LV1, 10 square meters.</p>
<p>Materials required to upgrade to LV2. 50 foundation stones, 200 wood, 150 stone, five iron ingots, three copper ingots. Special requirement, island core stability must reach 100%, currently 87%. Note, core stability increases naturally with the improvement of island facilities, the integrity of defenses, and the duration of a lord&#x27;s residence. It can also be rapidly increased by consuming specific materials or completing special events.</p>
<p>The requirements have indeed skyrocketed. 50 foundation stones, 200 pieces of wood, 150 stones, plus five iron and three copper. Core stability is also a completely new concept. Lynn Emmo glanced at the core stability of his island, 87%. It had likely decreased due to the battle and destruction.</p>
<p>However, according to the instructions, as long as he continued to live there and repair the facilities, it should gradually recover. As for this specific materials or special events that would rapidly increase stability, he had no clue at the moment. He was in a rush. His immediate priority was to use the resources he had, especially the massive amount of basic materials after the 100fold increase to exchange for other materials needed for the upgrade and further enhance his overall strength. He contacted Shen Duo Duo.</p>
<p>Initiate the basic materials for rare items program. Use our stockpiled standard timber, stone, fiber, and ordinary rope to exchange in large quantities for foundation stones, complete animal hides, high-quality hemp or plant fibers, special resins, bone glue, and any timber or stone samples labeled with strong, tough, or lightweight properties. Prices can be 50% to 10% lower than market prices with low profit margins and high sales volume for rapid turnover. In addition, focus on finding out how to quickly improve core stability. Write down any relevant information, no matter how absurd it may seem.</p>
<p>She and Duo Duo immediately understood. Got it. Use our almost unlimited basic materials to flood the market, exchange them for scarce and high-end goods, and gather intelligence at the same time. The demand for foundation stones is always high, and many people are stuck at level one to level two. If we release wood and stone at low prices, we can definitely get a lot in return.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go arrange it right away. Also, Linmo added, &quot;Keep an eye on the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood s movements. If possible, try to exchange our incomplete information about the eternal frost path for their knowledge of the island core stability or ancient building techniques. Be sincere and show that we are only seeking knowledge, not hostile. Those people from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood are so secretive.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll get a try, Chin. and Duo Duo agreed. After ending the communication, Lynn Mo began to personally operate another line. Leveraging the credibility of the J identity, he posted a brief acquisition notice on the regional channel J. Acquire concrete intelligence or physical assets related to island core stability.</p>
<p>Customized defense solutions, advanced building materials, or equivalent resources can be exchanged. The message was brief, but the name Jay itself was eye-catching enough. Soon, private messages flooded in. Most were guesses and hearsay, but a few were noteworthy. A message from an ID calling themselves ruins Cleaner.</p>
<p>While exploring a shallow water ruin, I found a glowing blue crystal. When I touched it, the island vibrated slightly and the system prompted stable energy source detected. Absorb. I didn&#x27;t dare to touch it at the time. I can tell you the location of the crystal, but you&#x27;ll need a complete set of personal protective equipment and 3 days worth of food.</p>
<p>Blue crystal, a stable energy source. Lynn Emmo noted it down and replied, &quot;Okay, first pay with the crystal&#x27;s coordinates and a detailed description of its appearance. After verification, pay half of the equipment and food. The remaining balance will be paid after you successfully acquire and deliver the crystal or confirm the detailed reason why you cannot acquire it.&quot; Another message came from an ID called geologist written in a professional tone based on my observations and limited experiments. Core stability is related to the island&#x27;s foundation structure, material homogeneity, and the presence of energy buildup or structural stress points.</p>
<p>Repairing obvious damage, optimizing the layout, and reinforcing with similar materials can all slowly improve it. Rapid improvement may require neutralizing energy buildup such as certain radioactive minerals or introducing stable resonators such as crystals of specific frequencies. I have a preliminary simple method for detecting island structural stress which is available for trade. This intelligence seems more reliable. Linmo traded a high efficiency heat insulation material formula and a batch of standard wooden boards for this testing method.</p>
<p>The method is very crude, mainly relying on observing the rate of water accumulation in different areas, the difference in ice layer thickness, and using a simple pendulum rope weight to test the ground&#x27;s horizontal vibration feedback to roughly determine where there might be structural weaknesses or energy anomalies. Linmo immediately began testing it on his island. Sure enough, in the areas most severely bombarded by Caesar&#x27;s electric arc, the pendulum swaying was noticeably irregular. And in one spot where the ice had melted and were frozen, the rate of water accumulation was different from other areas. These were likely structural stress points.</p>
<p>He noted down these locations, intending to focus on their restoration later. Over the next few days, Lynn Emmo entered a high-speed operating mode. During the day, he repaired the island, optimizing its layout according to the methods of a geologist, making the functional areas, residence, storage, fishing grounds, and defense more clearly defined and reinforcing weak points with similar materials. At the same time, he systematically carried out large-scale resource exchanges through Chin Duo and several smaller accounts. A massive influx of standard timber and stone into the market, though a to slightly lower unit price, was quickly exchanged from mountains of foundation stones, various types of fur and fibers, and many strange but potentially useful trinkets.</p>
<p>Almost every corner of the island was piled high with materials. Core stability increased slowly but steadily during this process. 89% 91% 94%. At the same time, through the J channel, he used some non-core defense knowledge and materials to obtain the specific coordinates of the blue crystal from the ruins cleaner located in a dangerous shallow reef area. He also obtained fragments of more mysterious information about energy resonance objects and structural stability runes from other channels.</p>
<p>Although most of them could not be verified immediately, they were all archived for future use. Good news also came from Su Chians side. The cold wave had basically subsided. Most of the sea ice had melted and shipping lanes were being restored. She used the heart of the ocean to help several small friendly groups avoid several dangerous ocean currents during the melting ice period, which improved her reputation.</p>
<p>At the same time, she confirmed that the abnormal heat source in the southeast direction was more clearly sensed and roughly matched the direction of the restless sea. in Caesar&#x27;s notes. Dragon&#x27;s soul steel gun contacted Lynn Mo again, informing him of the latest developments of the Wings of Freedom. After retreating to a stronghold, Caesar was frantically preparing, acquiring large quantities of weapons and ship materials while simultaneously intensifying his efforts to annex surrounding forces, clearly accumulating strength for the next large-scale operation. Dragon Soul strengthened its patrols and intelligence network in the SH739 area and again subtly offered to assist Linmo in relocating to a safer area if needed.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo declined again but provided more information about the distribution of Freedom Wings outposts and resource points excerpted from his notebook in return thus solidifying this mutually beneficial intelligence alliance. On the evening of the seventh day, Lynn Emmo stood in the center of the island. The island information is clearly displayed on the wristbands light screen. Island level LV1 10 square meters. Materials required to upgrade to LV2 50 foundation stones 5250ths 200 wood 215/200 150 stone 1621 150 five iron ingots 1025 three copper ingots 102/3 special requirement island core stability reaches 100% currently 100% all conditions are met do you wish to upgrade to LV2 you have been detected as the first survivor globally to meet the requirements for LV2 upgrade.</p>
<p>A serverwide announcement will be made upon upgrade and you will receive additional rare rewards. Hide your personal information. Hide. Upgrade. Lynn Mo said without hesitation.</p>
<p>A familiar tremor resounded stronger than before. The materials piled in the designated area transformed into streams of light, merging into the island. The stone platform expanded outwards again, growing from 10 square meters to 15 square meters, its edges becoming more regular and the stone subtly revealing a metallic sheen. A more stable and substantial feeling rose from beneath one&#x27;s feet. Upgrade successful.</p>
<p>Your island has reached LV2 15 square m. Gained basic buff. Efficient organization slightly increases island storage space utilization. Congratulations. You are the first survivor in the world to upgrade the island to LV2 rewards.</p>
<p>Special facility blueprint basic lookout asterisk one foundation stones asterisk 100 iron ingots asterisk 20 copper ingots asterisk 10 rare resource energy storage crystal minor asterisk 1. The announcement resonated globally. The regional channel was in an uproar once again. But before people could recover from the shock of Jay taking first place again, something even more astonishing happened. Just 10 minutes later, another global announcement exploded.</p>
<p>Global announcement. Congratulations to Survivor J for becoming the first person in the world to upgrade the island to LV3. Award, double hit. Then came a triple attack, four hit combo. In the next two hours, announcements rang out from all over the world.</p>
<p>The name Jay streaked across the silent night sky like the most dazzling shooting star, soaring from LV2 to LV5 at a breathtaking speed. When a final announcement that Jay had become the world&#x27;s first owner of a level five island rang out, the entire world channel fell into a brief silence followed by complete frenzy. What happened? Did they take a rocket? Promoted four ranks in a row. How&#x27;d he do that? Materials. Where did he get so many materials? Monster.</p>
<p>This is a monster. The title King of Storms is so awesome. Yes, with the final announcement, a brand new title shimmering with the emblem of thunderclouds and waves appeared before the name Jay, King of the Storm. Congratulations on obtaining the exclusive title, King of Storms. Beginner effect slightly increases your perception and adaptability to natural weather phenomena such as storms and waves within your island and a certain area of surrounding waters.</p>
<p>slightly increases your leadership ability. Linmo stood on the island, which had now expanded to 25 square meters, feeling the solid ground beneath his feet and the subtle newfound sensitivity to the surrounding air currents and water ripples in his mind. The island&#x27;s layout was more rational with preliminary outlines of low walls appearing along the edges and a shallow depression automatically forming in the center to collect rainwater. The fifth level island brought not only an increase in area but also a qualitative change. He felt that his connection with the island had become even closer.</p>
<p>Inside the bracelet space, four waves of upgrade rewards piled up like a mountain. Hundreds of foundation stones, a large amount of metal, several precious blueprints, including the basic workshop, the upgraded version of the rainwater collector, etc., and several energy storage crystals that shimmerred with a faint light. More importantly, new features are unlocked as the island reaches level 5. Unlock basic communication tower buildable build unlocked. Area map rough expansion unlocked.</p>
<p>Level five island exclusive quest chain not yet available. Unlock group chat feature can create or join. Group chat function. This means he can more easily build his core team. Myuan pavilion should be established.</p>
<p>The basic communication tower and simple dock with a hardware foundations that enabled him to reach a wider world. The sea breeze caressed my face, carrying the moist scent of melting ice. Lyn Mo gazed into the distance, his eyes seemingly piercing through the gradually clearing night sky, landing on the distant restless sea. The king of storms is in position, and his ship will crush all the storms. Chapter 19.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan&#x27;s initial establishment. Allies fall into the trap. The tidal king of storms shone brightly in the night sky like a brand heralding the beginning of a new era. Lin Mo stood in the center of the 25 square meter island. Feeling the unprecedented solidity and weight of the land beneath his feet.</p>
<p>A level 5 island brought more than just an increase in area. It brought a comprehensive qualitative change. The low walls, though short, were clearly defined. The shallow puddles indicated that he could begin planning a more systematic freshwater collection system. Most importantly, the subtle yet close connection he felt with the island made him feel more like an extension of this land than merely a sojourer.</p>
<p>On the wristband screen, the newly unlocked function icons shown brightly. He first tapped the most crucial one, the group chat function. A pop-up notification appears. Your title king of the storm has been detected and your reputation has met the requirements. You can create or join a group chat.</p>
<p>Creating a group chat requires one communication token already issued as an upgrade reward or equivalent resources. The size and functionality of the group chat are related to the creators island level and reputation. Create a group chat. Please name it. Create it.</p>
<p>Name it. Moan pavilion. Linmo. Didn&#x27;t he hesitate? Mo means profound and strategic. Yuan symbolizes depth and inclusiveness and represents a relatively independent and orderly space.</p>
<p>This aligns with his original intention of establishing an elite small group and developing in a low-key manner. The group chat Moyuan Pavilion has been successfully created. This is currently a basic group chat with a maximum of 10 members. It features text and voice communication and allows sharing of basic map markers, but requires members to be within a certain communication range affected by island level and facilities. Cost daily maintenance requires a small amount of basic resources.</p>
<p>You have obtained pavilion master privileges. Almost the instant the group chat was created before the tsunami caused by JS as four-level jump and the title of King of Storms had subsided, new changes had already occurred in the regional channels and the wider world channels announcement of the creation of countless group chats began to flood the screen. Dragon Soul East China Sea branch officially established, uniting compatriots to jointly resist foreign aggression. Wings of freedom calling upon warriors, the law of the jungle prevails. The strong are respected.</p>
<p>The mutual a brotherhood welcomes all friends who trade honestly and help each other. Stonemason&#x27;s workshop dedicated to exploration and construction cordially invites like-minded individuals. Food research society. Various factions and groups with different ideologies sprang up like mushrooms after rain. Reaching level five on the island unlocked not only new features, but also officially propelled the previously loose and anonymous world of survivors into an era of organization and factionalism.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo&#x27;s Emo Yuan Pavilion was tucked among them, completely inconspicuous. He hadn&#x27;t invited anyone yet. He was waiting and he was also selecting. First, he sent Su Chanchian a group chat invitation with a brief note. My group Emo Yuan Go is not open to the public yet.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re the first one. A few seconds later, the invitation was accepted. Such Chanchians ID, Shallow Sea Scholar, appeared in the member list. Congratulations, Storm King. Such Chanchians private message followed closely with a hint of teasing, but more so with seriousness.</p>
<p>The commotion is too big. Now everyone&#x27;s eyes are on you. Wings of freedom are probably going crazy. As expected, Linmo replied, &quot;Let us talk in the group chat. I need you to use Heart of the Ocean to help me keep an eye on all unusual ship movements in the nearby waters, especially those of the Freedom Wings type.</p>
<p>In return, I will grant you partial access to the Mo Yuon Pavilion Source Library.&quot; Understood. I will continue to monitor it. Also, after the cold wave completely passed, the abnormal heat source signal in the southeast direction became stronger and more regular, which can almost certainly be confirmed to be related to the restless sea. I drew a preliminary graph of the change in induction intensity and sent it to the group file that Sue Chinshian quickly got into the swing of things and uploaded a simple line drawing to the group chat, which only had two people. The image shows that the heat source signal fluctuates regularly like a heartbeat and its intensity is slowly increasing.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like something is awakening or gathering energy. Line looked at the diagram thoughtfully. Continue to observe. Also, be careful yourself. Caesar probably hates me the most right now and he might take his anger out on people related to me.</p>
<p>I will be careful. My island is well hidden and its defenses have been strengthened. Su Chanchian replied. After ending his conversation with Su Chanchian, Lin Mo began processing other messages. Countless requests to join Mo Yuan Guu or to send private messages flooded in, but he ignored them and directly blocked messages from non-conts.</p>
<p>What he needs are elites, trustworthy, capable partners with shared ideals, not a mob of people just there for the ride. He thought of two people. First is sure how ID Iron Wall. This former veteran is upright and resolute. His few pronouncements on the regional channel revealed his commitment to keeping promises and prioritizing the overall situation.</p>
<p>More importantly, based on intelligence previously shared by Dragon Soul and Lin Mozone observations, Sherhow has performed exceptionally well in several small-cale conflicts and rescue operations, demonstrating considerable individual combat strength and expertise in defensive organization and on the spot command. This is precisely the shield and general Lynn Emmo urgently needs. He found Show&#x27;s ID and sent him a brief private message. Ironwall, this is Jay. I find you to be methodical and trustworthy.</p>
<p>I have established the Inc. Abyss Pavilion with the aim of establishing order, protecting our fellow practitioners, and exploring a way out. We lack someone who can lead the defense and safeguard the rear. Would you like to discuss this further? Without promising benefits or exaggerating the crisis, he directly stated his intentions and needs. For someone like Sher How, being straightforward is more effective.</p>
<p>After sending a message, Lynn Mo didn&#x27;t just wait. He contacted a second person, Shiendu Duo. The conversation with Chindo Duo was much more direct. The group chat is open. My faction is Moyuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>You have a great talent for business operations and I need an agent who can handle transactions, integrate resources and expand channels in the open. I am formally inviting you to join and be responsible for all external business affairs of my UN pavilion. You will enjoy profit sharing and decision-making participation rights, but you must abide by the core rules. Do not cheat the poor. Do not cross the bottom line.</p>
<p>And be completely transparent with me. Think about it. He also sent over a preliminary draft of a cooperation framework that clearly defined rights, responsibilities, and benefits. He emphasized that while providing Chin Duo Duo with sufficient benefits in space, it was also crucial to clearly define bottom lines and constraints. After dealing with these matters, Lynn Mo began planning the island&#x27;s new construction.</p>
<p>A level five island could now build a basic communication tower and a simple dock. The communication tower requires wood, stone, and metal, as well as the rewarded energy storage crystals. Once built, it can expand the effective communication range of group chats, and may even unlock more advanced communication or reconnaissance functions in the future. A simple dock requires a large amount of stone and timber, as well as waterproofing and anti-corrosion treatment. With a dock, his future ships can dock safely, and goods can be loaded and unloaded easily.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to bring up the building interface, Su Chinshin suddenly sent a hurried voice message in the group chat with a background sound of howling wind and faint metallic clanging. Then Montac about 15 km to the southwest. There are three ships besieging a small island. The ships are wings of freedom. The energy reaction of the besieged island is familiar.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a small observation post that I exchanged intelligence with before. The person in charge is called Stargazer, and there are only two of them. Their combat strength is very weak. They won&#x27;t last long. Caesar may not be on the ship, but the leader is a ruthless character.</p>
<p>Was the Wings of Liberty eliminating surrounding smaller factions? Or had they discovered the value of that observation post, which might also have reconnaissance capabilities? In any case, failing to help someone in distress was against Lin Moe&#x27;s principles, especially such blatant bullying. Moreover, this could also be an opportunity to test his newly acquired power and potentially gain new allies or intelligence. &quot;Send me the coordinates,&quot; Lyn Mo replied calmly while quickly checking his equipment. &quot;A simple crossbow, arrows, a stone axe, a dagger, and several Molotov cocktails made from animal fat and clay pots.&quot; He glanced at the communications tower and dock, which were still just foundations under construction, and turned to walk towards the shore without hesitation. There, Morde was his only means of water, transport, a modified raft, slightly larger than his previous one, with a makeshift cabin, and a small sail.</p>
<p>Its power and defenses remained worrisome, but this was all he could manage for the time being. He leaped onto the raft, raised the sail, adjusted his course, and sped off towards the coordinates sent by Su Chanchchan. The sea breeze whipped at his forehead, revealing a pair of calm, deep-seated eyes beneath. The Storm King&#x27;s first battle was not about defense, but about an expedition. The raft cut through the waves, moving slowly but resolutely toward the sea, where an unjust war was taking place.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, he received two replies. Sure. How? Mr. J, I have long admired you. I am committed to upholding integrity and protecting my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Could you please tell me about the specific charter and current goals of my UN pavilion? If our ideals align, I am willing to follow in your footsteps. Chin duo duo sect leader. I am willing to serve you like a dog. I have read the regulations and they are reasonable. I will strictly abide by the rules, expand the territory for you, and share your burdens.</p>
<p>When can I begin my duties? Lynn Mo juggled the raft with other tasks, trying to recover amidst the turbulence. For sure, how? The charter will be sent to you later. Current goals. One, defend our foundation and establish a safe zone. Two, integrate reliable forces to form a core.</p>
<p>Three, explore the turbulent sea and acquire key resources. There is only one principle in this chaotic world. Establish an order and fairness that we recognize. Welcome to the team. From this moment forward, you will be the external affairs steward of the Moan Pavilion.</p>
<p>Your first task, use existing channels to acquire all information and physical objects related to the restless sea, eye of the storm, ancient sea charts, and advanced ship building technology at any cost. Resources will be allocated to you later. After replying, he turned off the light screen and fixed his gaze on the faint outlines of ships and lights appearing on the horizon ahead. Though the raft is small, it is its first test of skill. Although the Miuan Pavilion has been established, its path has only just begun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the distant flames of war and cries of agony await him, the newly crowned king of the storm, to deliver judgment and bring an end to them. He gripped the crossbow tightly, the sail billowing in the sea breeze like wings about to unfurl. Chapter 20. Rescue. Amidst the raging sea, first signs of strength.</p>
<p>The speed of a raft is ultimately limited. When Lin Mo arrived at the vicinity of the coordinates, the battle seemed to be nearing its end. Three modified Freedom Wing ships surrounded a small rocky island in a triangular formation. A half collapsed shack and burning flames were faintly visible on the island. Two small boats had already docked and a dozen or so figures were searching and vandalizing the island.</p>
<p>Shouts and curses carried on the wind. The third larger ship patrolled the outer perimeter with a bald burly man wearing a fur vest standing at the bow, arms crossed, coldly observing the scene. Lynn Mo lowered the sail about 500 meters from the battlefield and used a protruding rock to conceal the raft. He took out his homemade moninocular telescope and observed carefully. The besieged island was small, not much larger than his initial island.</p>
<p>It was rugged and easily defensible, but the defenders were clearly outnumbered and outgunned, and their defenses have been breached. Besides the burning shacks, there was a small area enclosed by stones, where some rudimentary observation equipment appear to be set up several wooden poles at different angles with metal plates and glass mirrors hanging from them, reflecting the fire light. This was probably the observation post Su Chanchian had mentioned. Two figures were forced behind rocks at the edge of the island. They could be vaguely made out to be a man and a woman.</p>
<p>The man held a harpoon and the woman seemed to be holding a sharpened wooden stick, making a lastditch effort. The attacking Freedom Wings members numbered about seven or eight, armed with various weapons, laughing and joking as if playing cat and mouse. The bald, burly man on the outer boat must be the leader of this operation. Judging from his calm and composed demeanor, he clearly believes victory is assured. Lynn Emmo quickly assessed the situation.</p>
<p>A direct assault wouldn&#x27;t work. His raft and equipment were far inferior. He had to outsmart them, create chaos, and rescue them amidst the confusion. His gaze swept over the patrolling ship on the outer perimeter, then looked at the freedom wing members on the island who were wreaking havoc and whose attention was completely focused on their prey. A plan took shape in my mind.</p>
<p>He quietly tied the raft of the rocks. Took a simple crossbow, all the arrows, and three Molotov cocktails, took off his heavy winter coat to lighten his load, wearing only close-fitting leather armor and waterproof trousers, and slid into the icy sea with a dagger in his mouth. The seaater was icy cold, but he moved swiftly like a fish, silently diving towards the patrolling ship on the outer edge. Thanks to the gradual improvement in his physique brought about by the hundfold increase in strength, as well as the tempering he had undergone in the harsh environment during this period, his endurance and underwater breath holding ability far exceeded those of ordinary people. He circled around to the stern below the rudderblade, a blind spot.</p>
<p>There were only two people on board, one on guard at the bow and the other adjusting ropes near the cabin, neither of them noticing the subtle underwater movements. Linmo took out a small piece of rope soaked in grease from the leather pouch of his waist, quickly carved a deep groove in the wooden plank near the water line at the stern of his dagger, stuffed the rope in, lit it, and then quickly submerged, swimming towards the other side of the island. The grease rope burned slowly but produced thick smoke. A few seconds later, black smoke billowed from the stern. &quot;What&#x27;s going on? The stern is on fire!&quot; the watchman at the bow exclaimed in alarm as he was the first to notice.</p>
<p>The people tidying up the ropes were also startled and rushed over to check. Just then, Lynn Emmo emerged from behind a reef on the other side of the island, far from where the wings of freedom had landed. He took a deep breath, raised his simple crossbow, and aimed at the wings of freedom member on the island who was holding a machete with his back to him and shouting the loudest. The distance is about 80 m. There is wind and the target is moving.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very difficult. Linmo held his breath. his muscle memory and wind sense from his rudimentary archery skills, automatically adjusting in his mind. He slightly raised his arm, anticipating the wind direction and adjusting his lead. Whoosh! The wooden arrow left the bowring, tracing a low flat arc up.</p>
<p>The wings of freedom member screamed as the wooden arrow pierced deep into his shoulder. The machete in his hand clattered to the ground and he fell forward. Enemy attack behind us. Chaos erupted on the island. The wings of freedom turned around in shock only to see an empty sea and reefs.</p>
<p>Over there behind the rocks, someone with sharp eyes spotted the splash of water Emmo made as he retreated. Damn it, there are accompllices. Send three men to kill him, roared a man who looked like the leader. Immediately, three people jumped onto a small boat mored at the shore, cursing and rowing towards the reef where Linmo was. This was exactly the effect Lynn Mo wanted to disperse the enemy&#x27;s forces and create chaos and panic.</p>
<p>He quickly moved behind another reef and watched the small boat approach. There were three people on the boat, one rowing and two carrying harpoons and short spears, looking menacing. Limo calmly cocked the bowring again. This time the distance was closer, about 30 m. He aimed at the rower.</p>
<p>Shoot the horse before the man. The second arrow was fired. The rower was hit in the chest, groaned and fell backward. The earth slipped from his hand, and the small boat spun sideways on the sea. The other two were shocked, and before they could react, Lynmo&#x27;s third arrow had already arrived.</p>
<p>Another man was hit in the shoulder and fell into the sea with a cry of pain. The remaining man with a short spear was terrified and lay prone in the cabin, too scared to show his face. The large ship on the outer perimeter was also in chaos. Although the fire at the stern had been extinguished, the smoke had not yet dissipated. Coupled with the attack on the island, the bold, burly man roared as he directed the ship to turn and provide support, but his movements were slowed by the reefs and shallows.</p>
<p>On the island, a man and a woman whose pressure had suddenly eased seized their opportunity. The man burst out from behind the rocks, harpooning a freedom wings member who was facing away from him and gazing out at the sea into the back of the heart. The woman screamed and stabbed another man in the back of the knee with a wooden stick. The wings of Liberty were attacked from both sides. And with their leader wounded by an arrow and reinforcements from the sea blocked, their morale collapsed instantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Retreat! Retreat to the ship first!&quot; the leader shouted horsely, clutching his bleeding arm. The survivors frantically abandoned the wounded and the bodies of their companions, scrambling towards the small boats on the shore. Some slipped and fell into the sea in the chaos, but no one paid them any attention. The large ship finally drew closer and lowered a rope to provide assistance. The bald burly man stood at the bow, his face ashen, staring intently at the direction of the reef where Lin Mo was hiding.</p>
<p>He then glanced at the couple on the island who were finishing off the enemy and collecting their spoils, his eyes filled with a chilling malice, but he did not order a full-scale attack. The situation was unclear. His own side had suffered heavy losses, and continuing the entanglement would be counterproductive. Go. He finally managed to squeeze out the word through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Three ships, one of which was a small boat and was unmanned, carrying the remnants of the defeated army sailed away from the area in a sorry state. Only after the ship&#x27;s silhouette completely disappeared off the horizon did Lynn and Mo swim back to his raft from behind the rocks. He climbed onto the raft, soaked to the bone. cold sea water dripping from his hair. He quickly dried himself, put on his outer robe, and then steered the raft slowly toward the ravaged island.</p>
<p>On the island, a man and a woman supported each other, wearily watching the approaching raft. The man was about 30 years old with a thin face, wearing a pair of homemade glasses made of wooden frames and glass, one lens broken, and several abrasions on his body. The woman was in her early 20s, her hair disheveled, her face covered in soot, clutching the bloodstained wooden stick tightly in her hand, her eyes defiant. Halt, who are you? The man raised his harpoon, his voice, but firm. Just passing by, I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing them ganging up on us.</p>
<p>Lyno stopped a few meters away in the shallow water, not immediately going ashore. He showed off the simple crossbow in his hand, then placed it on the raft, indicating that he meant no harm. So Kyangen sent me. Upon hearing Su Chanchians name, the two visibly relaxed, but their vigilance remained. Sister Chen, how does she know about us? The woman murmured.</p>
<p>She sensed the energy fluctuations and the battle here. Lynn Emmo explained simply. Are you stargazers? The man and woman exchanged a glance and nodded. I am Leewi and this is my sister Leewinio. We were indeed trying to do some astronomical and marine meteorological observations.</p>
<p>Thank you for saving us. Leewi put down the harpoon, his tone much gentler, filled with exhaustion and gratitude from surviving the ordeal. Why did the wings of freedom attack you? Lynmo asked. Leewi smiled. Riley, it&#x27;s probably because we previously observed some abnormal ocean currents and meteorological data which we shared on the regional channel and that caught their attention.</p>
<p>They think we might have special value or they simply think we&#x27;re easy to bully and want to seize our pitiful equipment and accumulated data. Has the data been stolen? I had the important core record book and they smash some peripheral instruments. Lee Winio said her eyes reening. Those instruments were made by them by saving every penny and collecting materials bit by bit. Lynn Emmo glanced at the burning ruins and broken wooden poles on the island, but said nothing.</p>
<p>He maneuvered the raft to the shore and jumped aboard. It&#x27;s not safe here anymore. The wings of freedom might come again or send someone else. Linu said bluntly, &quot;What are your plans?&quot; Lewi and Lee Wangis faces showed bewilderment and despair. Their small island had been almost destroyed by this calamity, and it seemed nearly impossible for the two of them to rebuild it and defend against possible retaliation.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo was silent for a moment before speaking. I&#x27;ve created a small group called Amo Yuon Pavilion. There aren&#x27;t many people there yet, but our goal is to establish a relatively safe and orderly place where we can explore the truth of this world. If you&#x27;re willing, you can join temporarily and contribute your observation techniques and knowledge. We will provide protection and basic survival resources.</p>
<p>Of course, you&#x27;re free to leave. He didn&#x27;t use a condescending tone, but rather laid out the cooperation openly. The ability to observe meteorological and oceanographic data will be of immense value for his future exploration of the restless sea and even wider ocean areas. Leewi and Lee Wincio looked at each other again. Lee Wangiu asked in a low voice, &quot;Brother, what about us?&quot; Leeway pushed up his broken glasses, took a deep breath, and looked at Lin and Mo.</p>
<p>We need to discuss this. Also, may I ask who you are? He noticed Lin Mo&#x27;s simple but practical equipment on the raft, as well as his precise and deadly archery skills just now, which indicated that he was no ordinary passer by. Lyn Mo thought for a moment, but instead of directly revealing the name Jay, he said, &quot;Just call me Mo. I&#x27;m one of the founders of Mo Yu.&quot; Just then, Lin Mo&#x27;s bracelet vibrated. It was Sue Chanchians voice message in the group chat filled with concern.</p>
<p>Lynmo, how&#x27;s the situation over there? I sense that the battle fluctuations have stopped and the energy reaction from the Wings of Freedom is moving away. Linmo replied directly in the group chat. It&#x27;s resolved. Wings of Freedom has withdrawn. We rescued two people, Leewi and Lee Wio, the stargazers you mentioned.</p>
<p>They suffered considerable losses and I&#x27;m inviting them to temporarily join the Mo Yuan Pavilion. Su Chian, that&#x27;s great. They&#x27;re very reliable and their observation data is invaluable. Welcome to the team. Leeway Wang Xiu, this is Sue Chen.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m glad everything&#x27;s all right now. When Leewi and Lee Wio heard Su Chanchians familiar voice coming from Linmo&#x27;s bracelet, they finally let down their guard and their faces showed surprise and excitement. Sister Chanchian, it really is you. We almost. Leewio&#x27;s voice choked with emotion.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all right. Come back with Mo first and we&#x27;ll discuss this further. Su Xian comforted her. Leewi nodded heavily, looked at Linmo, and said solemnly, &quot;Mr. Mo, my sister and I are willing to join the Mo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>We dare not say anything else, but we will do our best to observe celestial phenomena and see conditions and record and analyze data. Welcome, Lin Monted. Pack up anything usable and let&#x27;s leave as soon as possible. Half an hour later, Lynn Mo&#x27;s raft carrying Leewi and his sister and a waterproof package containing valuable observation records and several core instrument parts sailed away from the rocky island still bearing the marks of war and sorrow. On the raft, Leewencio carefully wiped a broken piece of glass while he eyes silently watched his homeland gradually recede into the distance, becoming a small black dyno stood at the stern, steering the ship.</p>
<p>The sea breeze made his robes flutter loudly. The Mayuan pavilion welcomed its third and fourth members, a brother and sister scholar with special skills. The storm king&#x27;s first external operation ended with a lightning rescue and the defeat of the wings of freedom. The news soon carried by the fleeing soldiers would spread throughout the sea. Lyn Mo&#x27;s name Emo will also enter the field of vision of various forces for the first time.</p>
<p>He looked southeast towards the direction of the restless sea. The ship needs to be built. The people need to be gathered. The road ahead is still long, but the first step has already been taken firmly. Chapter 21.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan assembles. Division of labor and set sail. It was late at night when he brought Leewi and his sister back to his island. The 25 square meter island appeared more crowded than usual in the night, but it also felt more lively. Linmo cleared out the corner where materials have been stored and temporarily built two simple shelters with wood and tarpollen.</p>
<p>He also took out spare animal hide blankets and a simple cooking set from a storage which serve as a temporary accommodation for the new members. The conditions are basic, so let&#x27;s make do for now. Safety first, Linu said succinctly. Looking at this place, which was more solid and well organized than their original island, Leewi and Lee Wanchio were particularly struck by the sight of the tin stove glowing warmly in the corner and the neatly stacked supplies beside it. A look of amazement and relief flashed in their eyes.</p>
<p>This was far from rudimentary compared to their recently destroyed home. This place was practically a fortress. That&#x27;s already very good, Mr. Mo. Thank you.</p>
<p>Leeway sincerely thanked him and Leewin show also bowed quickly. No need to be polite. Just call me Linmo from now on. Or you can call me Pavilion Master like they do. Lin Mo waved his hand.</p>
<p>Rest first and recover your strength. You can boil water in the stove and there&#x27;s clean water in the jar over there. The food is in the box over there. Help yourself. We&#x27;ll talk in detail tomorrow.</p>
<p>After making the arrangements, Lin Mo returned to his reinforced shed. First, letting Su Chinshin know he was safe via group chat and then began processing the backlog of messages. Sure. how and Shin Duo Duo both sent more detailed replies expressing their willingness to join and inquiring about the next steps. Lynn Mo posted the first official announcement in the Mo Yuan group chat.</p>
<p>The first core meeting of the Mouan Pavilion will be held at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Location, main island. Agenda one, establishment of the charter. Two, division of responsibilities.</p>
<p>Three, recent goals. Attendees: Lin Mo, Pavilion Master, Su Chian, Shallow Sea Scholar, Sherhow, Iron Wall, Chin, Do Manager, Chiian, Leewi, Stargazer, Leewia, Recorder. Please reply upon receipt. The message was sent and quickly receive a neat receive reply. Even the Lee siblings, who had just settled in, responded promptly.</p>
<p>The team&#x27;s execution ability was beginning to show. Lynmo then opened a message sent by Dragon Soul Steel Gun, which contained news brought back by the defeated soldiers of Wings of Liberty and Caesar&#x27;s latest reaction. Caesar was furious and executed two ring leaders who led the escape. He believes the attackers are Jay or someone closely associated with them has issued the highest bounty and provided some characteristics of the area where Jay might be hiding which differs from the earlier information on your island. The wings of Liberty are rapidly consolidating and preparing for a large-scale retaliation but the target is undecided possibly pointing to any suspected jail related forces or resourcerich areas.</p>
<p>In addition, we have detected an increased frequency of activity by the Stonemason Brotherhood in the SH739 area recently, seemingly searching for something possibly related to ancient nautical charts or ruins. Lynn Mo replied, &quot;The bounty information is known. Caesar is unlikely to dare to easily attack well-defended strongholds in the short term and is more likely to resort to harassment, cutting off resources, or seeking allies to exert pressure. I will strengthen my vigilance.&quot; The movements of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood are worth paying attention to. If there is any further information, we can share it.</p>
<p>In exchange, I can provide a high efficiency seawater desalination equipment improvement idea based on optimization of existing templates. After ending the communication, Lynn Mo leaned back on the animal hide cushion, gazing at the ceiling. The pressure was invisible yet expected. The Mo Yuan pavilion must be established and become combat ready as soon as possible. and the construction of the storm ship must be accelerated.</p>
<p>The next morning, as dawn broke on Lin Moe&#x27;s Island, the six of them gathered together for the first time. Suchinian was the first to arrive, riding in a small but sturdy looking single kayak. She was still dressed neatly, her long hair tied up and carrying a waterproof bag that seemed to contain her tools and documents. Sherhow arrived almost simultaneously, rowing a sturdy wooden raft made of logs and ropes. He was tall and robust with a buzzcut, a square face, and calm eyes.</p>
<p>He carried a simple shield reinforced with heavy planks and iron sheets on his back, and a short-handled ax hung at his waist. After landing on the island, he first nodded to Lynn Emmo and then silently began to observe the defensive arrangements around the island, his expression focused. Chandu Duo arrived a little later. His raft was equipped with a simple sun shade. He was wearing a merchant&#x27;s robe made of several different colors and textures of fabric.</p>
<p>He had a habitual smile on his face that said, &quot;Amicable business brings wealth.&quot; His eyes were narrowed. As soon as he arrived on the island, he greeted everyone with a cupped hand, but his eyes had already quickly scanned the piles of supplies and the new faces on the island. Leewi and Lee Wangziu had already stood up and stood to the side, looking somewhat reserved. Lyno didn&#x27;t exchange many pleasantries. He pointed to a cleared area in front of the shed where seats had been arranged around a circle of stones.</p>
<p>Sit down. Time is limited. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point. Everyone took their seats. The atmosphere became slightly solemn.</p>
<p>The Mo Yuan Pavilion is officially established today. Lynmo got straight to the point. We are not a disorganized group, nor are we a plundering gang. Our goal is to establish an order that we can control in this chaotic sea. to gain space for survival and development and to explore the truth behind this world.</p>
<p>To do this, we need power, resources, intelligence, and mutual trust. He glanced at the crowd. The charter is simple. Externally, we share the benefits and risks. Internally, everyone performs their duties and shares information.</p>
<p>Major decisions are made through democratic consultation, but in times of crisis, I have the final say. You may raise any objections now. Sure house said in a deep voice that&#x27;s how it should be in a crisis. There needs to be a leader. I have no objection.</p>
<p>He valued order and efficiency. What she cared more about was being able to study the marine environment with peace of mind and whether this group could provide corresponding support and protection. Chandu smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s only right that the pavilion master sets the course and we row the boats.&quot; Lewi and his sister exchanged a glance and quickly agreed. They were seeking asylum, so naturally they had no objections. Okay.</p>
<p>Linmo continued. Next is the division of labor. Sure. How? Yes. Sure.</p>
<p>How straightened his back. You are responsible for all defense affairs of the Mo Yuan Pavilion, personnel combat training, and the planning and command of external military operations. You are fully responsible for the further improvement of the island&#x27;s defense system. the establishment of an early warning mechanism and the basic combat skills training of core members. Provide me with a list of the required resources.</p>
<p>Lenmo entrusted him with this important task. A glint flashed in Sherhow&#x27;s eyes and he clased his hands in a deep fist salute. Sure how obeys. I will certainly live up to your expectations. You will serve as the chief researcher and intelligence officer of the Mo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for marine environmental monitoring, biological behavior analysis, weather and sea condition forecasting and detection of special energy points. At the same time, you will utilize your heart of the ocean talent to establish our intelligence network, monitor the movements of surrounding forces, especially the wings of freedom, and assess potential risks. All observation data and analysis reports will be archived and shared. Lin Mo&#x27;s definition of her role was very clear. seriously understood.</p>
<p>I will establish a monitoring system as soon as possible. In addition, regarding the abnormal heat source and restless sea in the southeast direction, I suggest that they be listed as priority targets for investigation and more detailed preparations are needed. That is exactly what we ll be discussing next. Lyno looked at Shin Duo Duo. Shin Duo Duo, your subordinate is here.</p>
<p>Shen Duo Duo responded immediately, striking a very confident pose. You will serve as the foreign affairs steward responsible for all external commercial trade, resource procurement, information acquisition, and some diplomatic liaison for the Mo Yuan pavilion. Utilize your channels and connections to obtain all necessary materials and intelligence for the pavilion. Your mission is to obtain the greatest benefit at the lowest cost while maintaining the secrecy and security of the Mo Yuan pavilion. Accounts must be settled daily and major transactions must be reported in advance.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo granted Shin Duo Duo considerable commercial autonomy, but also set clear boundaries. Chandoo&#x27;s eyes lit up. This was his area of expertise. Rest assured, Pavilion Master, I Chen will do my utmost to expand the Inc. Abyss Pavilion&#x27;s revenue streams and manage its finances well.</p>
<p>Leewi Leewio. Lenmo looked at the scholar brother and sister. The two immediately tensed up. You will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the astronomical and meteorological observation station of Mayuan Pavilion and assisting Sue Chian in data recording and analysis. At the same time, you will be responsible for organizing and archiving all the drawings, documents, and map information we obtain and establishing a knowledge base.</p>
<p>Your work is the cornerstone of our long-term development and exploration. Lyno gave them positions that were relevant to their majors and relatively safe. Leeway excitedly pushed up his glasses. We will definitely live up to our mission. We will rebuild the observation station as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Leewin Shio also nodded vigorously. Finally, it&#x27;s my turn. Lynamo said calmly. I&#x27;m responsible for overall planning, allocation of core resources, major decisions, and resolving the most difficult problems. At the same time, I&#x27;m preparing to build a ship capable of long-d distanceance voyages, which is crucial for the future development of Moan Pavilion.</p>
<p>Your full cooperation is needed. Building a long range ship, apart from Sue Chian, who had only vaguely heard of it, everyone else showed surprise, but then became excited. Having a ship meant true mobility and a wider world to explore. There are three short-term goals that Lynn Mo held up one finger. First, consolidate the foundation.</p>
<p>Shh will lead the effort to complete the island s defense upgrades and basic personnel training within a week. Su Chian will establish an early warning network. Shin Duo Duo will ensure a continuous supply of resources. Leewi and his sister will assist in establishing an observation station. Second, prepare for ship building.</p>
<p>I will compile a list of the core materials needed for the first phase. Chiian Duo Duo will be responsible for collecting or trading them through all available channels. Sherhow and Sue Chian will provide risk assessments of potential acquisition sites. Leewi and his sister will research materials and provide technical support. Third, intelligence infiltration focus on the movements of the Wings of Liberty, the objectives of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, and all information related to the restless sea and the eye of the stormed.</p>
<p>The task was clearly assigned and everyone understood their responsibilities. Now each of you please state your most pressing needs and difficulties. Lynn Mo concluded Sherhow needs personnel and materials to reinforce the defenses. Such Chian needs some specific materials to make sensor buoys. Chin Duo Duo needs startup capital and a list of safer trading channels.</p>
<p>Leewi and his sister need tools and materials to repair the observation instruments. Lynn and Mo noted everything down, allocated some resources on the spot, and agreed on the subsequent handover method. The meeting was brief and efficient. After it ended, Sherhow immediately began to inspect the island and plan defensive fortifications. Such Chian and Lewi, the siblings, huddled together to discuss the site selection for the observation station and the instrument repair plan.</p>
<p>Chandu duo meanwhile rubbed his hands together starting to plan how to make the most of his newly acquired authority and resources. Lynmo felt somewhat relieved after seeing the scene before him. yuan pavilion. This small boat has finally had its keel erected and its mast raised. Next, it&#x27;s time to brave the winds and waves and sail into the deep blue sea.</p>
<p>He walked back to the shed, spread out the blueprints for the storm sailboat, and his eyes fell on the keel main material item. It&#x27;s time to go and meet the mentor of this stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood and see if we can exchange some knowledge for this most important first bone. Chapter 22 dragon bones are hard to find. Undercurrents converge. The gears of Moan Pavilion began to turn, each performing its function, bringing a long lost sense of efficient order.</p>
<p>Sherhal planned the island&#x27;s defenses with near obsessive standards. Using the timber and stone supplied by Lin Mo, he built a halfperson high breast work on top of the existing low wall along the island&#x27;s edge with footh holes on the inner side for observation and firing. Firing holes were pre-drilled at key locations on the breast work and it was reinforced with a mixture of clay and gravel. Simple wooden observation platforms began to be built at the four corners. Although currently only frames, they were already taking shape.</p>
<p>He also enlisted Lee Weii&#x27;s help using his observational knowledge to set up simple warning lines with buoys and ropes at different distances around the island. If any ship or large creature touched these lines, it would trigger a bell connected to the island as an alarm. Su Chian and her brother Leeway set up a new observation station on a slightly higher sheltered spot on the island. Leeway carefully assembled the surviving instrument parts and considering Su Chian&#x27;s need for energy sensing, designed a composite device using lenses and metal plates at different angles to focus light or reflect energy fluctuations, then amplifying subtle changes through simple mechanical transmission and recording them on animal hide coated with carbon powder. Although rudimentary, it was the best they could achieve under the current conditions.</p>
<p>Leewin was responsible for meticulously recording each observation and comparing the data with Su Chians previous records. Chin Duo Duo thrived. Having gained partial control over basic resources authorized by Lyn Mo, he immediately sprang into action. Instead of openly and aggressively acquiring the advanced materials needed for the storm sailboat, he adopted a more indirect strategy. First, he posted listings for large quantities of highquality, lowpric standard timber, stone, and rope on several secondary trading channels under the name of the Emmo Yuan Merchant Guild, quickly attracting the attention of many small and medium-sized survivors and establishing his reputation.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, he privately contacted several reputable medium-sized teams, exchanging stable supplies of basic materials for special materials they might have idle or temporarily in used, such as highly resilient vines, a type of lightweight driftwood, and strange glowing ore. For the truly core items like century old hardwood and star pattern steel, he merely announced a high price offer and strictly limited the trading partners and methods to avoid attracting too much attention. Lynn and Mo himself focused on the toughest challenge, finding the main material for the keel, making contact with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. The keel of a storm ship was specified in the blueprints as either a hardwood rich in oil that is over a hundred years old or the spine of a deep sea behemoth. The former required finding an ancient forested island, while the latter required hunting a terrifying creature that seemed almost unbeatable at present.</p>
<p>Both were far beyond reach. Lynn Emmo pinned his hopes on the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. This mysterious organization specializing in ruins and ancient knowledge might know where to find this material or have an alternative. Instead of making direct contact, he spread the word through Chin Duo&#x27;s channels. He had a complete exploration record of the path of eternal frost and the bronze key under ice cliff.</p>
<p>The key to the storm sailboat blueprints were omitted and he was willing to exchange knowledge about the core loadbearing materials of ancient large-scale buildings or lost shipb building techniques with truly knowledgeable people. This is a carefully designed lure. Both the path of ever frost and the ice kiss cliff are extremely cold and dangerous places. Bringing back information from them demonstrates strength and exploratory ability. The ancient large-scale architecture and lost shipb building techniques hint at directions the other party might be interested in.</p>
<p>2 days after the news was released, nothing unusual happened. Just as Linmo was considering whether to adjust his strategy, an unexpected visitor appeared at the edge of Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s warning range in a very peculiar way. It was a small boat, very small, more like a meticulously calculated raft made of several planks of wood and pontoons than a boat. It had no power, simply drifting with the ocean currents to a small reef about 300 m from Lima Island. There was no one on the raft, only a square object tightly wrapped in a waterproof tarpollen.</p>
<p>The first person to discover it was Leewi, who was adjusting the observation mirror. He immediately reported it to Lin Mo and Sue Chanchan. Linmo personally rode the small boat closer. He used a long pole to lift the package onto the boat, and after checking that there were no traps, he brought it back to the island. The package contained no letters, only three items.</p>
<p>A palmized dark brown block would cover with fine growth rings, heavy to the touch, and emitting a faint pine set. A rough leather map with simple lines and symbols, and a simple gray white badge, neither gold nor stone, engraved with a chisel and compass cross pattern. The wooden block was a sample of century old hardwood. Although it was only a small piece, it was enough for Linmo to verify. He was almost certain that the characteristics of this wooden block closely matched the main material of the keel required by the blueprints in his mind.</p>
<p>On the map, a complex body of water is outlined with simple lines, a whirlpool shaped mark in the center, and ancient barely legible symbols beside it. At the edge of the map, a line of small print in common script reads, &quot;Sleeping forest, dragon&#x27;s backbone here. Risk assured, sleeping forest abyss, dragon spine. Does it refer to the keel material? That badge clearly represents the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood.&quot; The other party did not show up or engage in conversation, but responded directly with physical objects and a map. This meant that first, they knew Lin Mo&#x27;s needs.</p>
<p>Second, they had samples and even knew the origin. Third, they were willing to exchange, but on the condition that they would exchange the map and any subsequent possible contact in exchange for complete information on the path of Eternal Frost and Ice Kisscliffe. And fourth, they were extremely cautious and unwilling to reveal their identities and locations. It fits the mysterious, knowledgeoriented, and anti-combat style of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood very well. Su Chian Xian analyzed Sleeping Forest Abyss.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard this name in some fragments of ancient ocean legends. It is said to be a group of ancient wooden islands shrouded in mist with an abnormal flow of time, giant creatures, and many dangers. But it&#x27;s just a legend, and no one has ever confirmed its exact location. Lynn Emmo stroked the hardwood sample. Its texture was dense, its grain beautiful, truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>The vortex mark on the map might be the entrance or a key location. They&#x27;re offering this as both a sign of sincerity in a test. If we can&#x27;t even find a location on the map or dare not go there, we naturally don&#x27;t deserve anything more. Should we send someone to investigate? Sure, how asked in a deep voice. I can lead a small team.</p>
<p>No rush. Lin mo shook his head. Our defenses are not yet secure and the wings of freedom are watching us closely. It has not wise to split our forces and take risks. Besides, we need to verify whether this map is real or fake, and whether it is complete.</p>
<p>He decided to pay part of the reward first. He compiled a detailed report on the surrounding environment of the eternal frost path, the structure of the ice kiss cliff, and the characteristics of the frost eater. The key and blueprints were omitted, wrapped it in waterproof material, placed it on the unmanned raft, pushed it back into the sea, and let it drift away with the current. This is a silent dialogue. I have demonstrated my knowledge and exploratory abilities, and I have received your map and will verify it.</p>
<p>After dealing with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, Lynn Emmo summoned the core members and reported another important piece of intelligence that Shin Duo Duo had gathered. The Wings of Freedom are acquiring weapons and ship reinforcement materials on a massive scale, far exceeding usual quantities. Caesar seems to be personally overseeing the modification of several large galleys, adding iron rams to the bows and firing platforms to the sides. Chin Duo Duo reported his usual smile fading considerably. In addition, several of our peripheral trading points have reported that the Wings of Freedom have recently been inquiring about the locations of resourcerich areas and neutral observation stations, and their attitude is quite aggressive.</p>
<p>Leewi and his sister turned pale, clearly recalling their previous encounter. They are gathering strength, preparing for the next large-scale operation. Sure, how judged. The target could be a known resource island, or it could be us. Dragon Soul has also sent a warning.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s bounty has tripled and they&#x27;ve started recruiting some small and medium-sized rating groups, offering them benefits in an attempt to form a broader anti-J alliance, Lenmo added. However, there aren&#x27;t many who respond. Caesar&#x27;s reputation is too bad, and many people are afraid of being swallowed up. We need to speed up ship building. Sue Chian looked at Lynn Mo.</p>
<p>Only by having stronger mobility and naval combat capabilities can we break the passive defense situation. Whether it as acquiring resources or dealing with conflicts do Lynn Emmo nodded. That&#x27;s right. So we must get rid of the dragon bone material as soon as possible. No matter how dangerous sleeping forest abyss is, we have to go and explore it.</p>
<p>But before we go, we need to make full preparations. He looked at sure how the construction of a defense system cannot stop and we must also strengthen maritime vigilance and rapid response training. Looking at Sue Chin and Leeway use the observation station to analyze the possible marine climate and ocean current patterns of a sleeping forest abyss as much as possible even if it&#x27;s just speculation. Looking at Shien Duo Duo continue to acquire all possible exploration supplies. high strength ropes, climbing tools, protective gear, antidotes, lighting equipment.</p>
<p>At the same time, closely monitored the flow of freedom wing supplies, and determined their possible attack targets and timing. The group accepted the order and dispersed to prepare. Lynn Emmo walked alone to the edge of the island, gazing at the vast sea. The sample of century old hardwood in his hand was cold and heavy. The stonemason&#x27;s fraternity handed over knives and honey.</p>
<p>The wings of Liberty are sharpening their knives. The shadows are closing in. But his ship is missing the most crucial backbone. He gripped the wooden block tightly, his eyes calm and deep. It seems that an expedition into unknown and dangerous territory and an inevitable maritime conflict are about to follow one after another.</p>
<p>The small boat that has just set sail, Moan Pavilion, is about to face a real test of wind and waves. He turned and walked toward the defensive fortifications that were being constructed with great fanfare and were being worked on at a rapid pace. Time is running out. Chapter 23. Misty Forest Clash of Sentinels.</p>
<p>The map of Sleeping Forest was spread out on the stone platform. Its edges weighed down by a few small stones. The sea breeze was light, but it made the edges of the leather tremble slightly, and the simple lines and strange symbols on it seemed to wrigle along with it. Linmo Su Chian and sure how gathered around the map. She du duo was counting a batch of tough vines and metal fasteners he had just brought back not far away while I and his sister were adjusting the newly installed weather vein at the observation station a little further away.</p>
<p>The map is too simplistic dot sure how pointed to the large blank areas and the few markings on it. It only shows a general direction. The distance is unknown and there are almost no landmarks. Is this vortex marking an entrance or a dangerous area? The risk at your own risk signifies that they themselves may not have fully figured it out. Or perhaps it is indeed extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>There do such lightly tapped the curve representing water ripples on the map with her fingertip. Judging from the curvature and density of the lines, this body of water may have complex ocean currents, numerous reefs, and is prone to forming eddies and fog. If Sleeping Forest Abyss is indeed an ancient tree island group under certain climate conditions, the transpiration of the huge trees could very well lead to year-round fog, which combined with the complex terrain would form a natural labyrinth. Lynn and Mo listened to their analysis, his gaze falling on the century old hardwood sample they had brought. No matter how dangerous it is, we must get the keel.</p>
<p>The stormship is key to breaking the deadlock for us. He paused, but we can&#x27;t act rashly. Sure. How the formation and training of the expedition team must begin immediately. Quality over quantity will start with five to six people.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll be responsible for selection and training, focusing on their wilderness survival, climbing, teamwork, and adaptability. Understood. I&#x27;ll choose from the outstanding peripheral members who have performed well recently, as well as several promising talents from the original Dragon Soul. Sure. How immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Such an U and Leewi continue analyzing the map. Combine it with the known ocean currents and wind direction data to calculate a more precise search area and the best possible entry time. Also list all possible dangers and contingency plans, especially those related to biology and the environment. Lenmo looked at Sue Chen. Leave it to me.</p>
<p>Lee Wesy West records are very detailed. We can cross reference them. Sue Chin nodded then reminded him. As for the wings of freedom manager Chess intelligence indicates they read becoming increasingly active. Would it be wise for us to massively divert manpower and resources to explore? That&#x27;s exactly the problem.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo looked at Shin Duo Duo. Old Shen, has the Wings of Freedom made any more specific moves in their recent procurement of supplies? Besides weapons and ship reinforcement, have they made any large-scale purchases of exploration supplies such as ropes, lighting, medicine, and special clothing? Chandidau put down the vines in his hand, rubbed his hands together, and his usual smile faded slightly. I was just about to report this. According to several clandestine sources, Wings of Freedom has indeed recently been acquiring a batch of highquality climbing ropes, windproof lamps, and gas mask raw materials. The quantities aren&#x27;t particularly large, but they&#x27;re concentrated in one area.</p>
<p>In addition, they seem to be very interested in anti-h hallucination herbs and powerful insect repellents. However, they&#x27;re also acquiring sulfur, oil, and battering ram parts on a large scale. So, it&#x27;s difficult to determine whether these exploration supplies are for exploration or for attacking a stronghold in a specific terrain. We need to prepare on both fronts. Lynn Mo pondered.</p>
<p>Caesar is stupid. He might also be looking for ways to quickly increase his strength, and exploring ruins or dangerous places is a possible option. At the same time, he hasn&#x27;t he given up on military expansion. We must be prepared for them to attack at any time or for their plans to collide with our objectives, though. Sure.</p>
<p>How&#x27;s eyes sharpened? Then we need to get the ke as soon as possible, build the sailboat, and take control of the seas. That s right that Lynmo made up his mind. The expedition team has preparations and training will proceed as usual, but the departure time will depend on the situation. During our absence, the island s defenses must be foolproof. Sure, how the final acceptance test of the defense system and the emergency response drills must be completed within 3 days.</p>
<p>Yes, Sherhow replied in a deep voice. Such Chian intensify the analysis. Chi and Duo Duo, continue to monitor the flow of supplies from Wings of Freedom, especially those purchases that may point to specific locations. Leeway, your observation stations must operate at full capacity. Report any abnormal weather or sea conditions immediately.</p>
<p>Everyone accepted the order and got to work. Over the next 2 days, the atmosphere on the island was tense yet orderly. Sher House selected six people from more than 30 peripheral members and several former Dragon Soul warriors to form an expedition reserve team which he personally led. They underwent highintensity acclimatization training in a complex reef area near the island, climbing slippery rock walls, securing ropes in the undercurrents, orienting themselves at night, making and dismantling simple traps, and team-based coordinated attacks and defenses. The training was tough, but no one complained.</p>
<p>Making it into the reserve team was a recognition in itself and everyone understood what the future expeditions meant. Su Chanchian and Leewi practically lived at the observation station and surrounded by data. Based on a few lines on the map, combined with Lewio&#x27;s recent ocean current log and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s experience with energy sensing, they repeatedly calculated and finally delineated a fan-shaped search area with a radius of about 50 nautical miles and predicted the weather windows that might appear in the next week. that would be relatively favorable for navigation and exploration. Chen Duo Duo, like a mole scurrying into the market, secretly smuggled back batches of essential expedition supplies through various overt and covert channels.</p>
<p>These included highquality ropes, lightweight yet durable waterproof fabric, speciallydesed non-slip shoe saws, water filtering bladders, concentrated food, first aid medicine, and even several well-maintained fine steel short knives from the black market. Meanwhile, his spies were constantly reporting on the wings of freedom&#x27;s movements. The three large galleys personally overseen by Caesar were nearing completion, their rams gleaming coldly. Several combat squads under his command were frequently seen near resource points on the edge of the SH 739 area, seemingly clearing out the area and establishing outposts. On the afternoon of the third day, just as Shure sure how was preparing to conduct the final comprehensive drill, the observation station that had been responsible for perimeter security suddenly rang its alarm.</p>
<p>Northeast, about 2 km away, an unidentified raft is rapidly approaching. It&#x27;s moving very fast and seems to have extra power. Leeway&#x27;s voice came through the newly set up makeshift megaphone connected by bamboo tubes filled with tension. The island instantly went on high alert. The reserve soldiers, still in training, immediately grabbed their weapons and rushed to their designated defensive positions.</p>
<p>Sherhow climbed to the highest observation post and raised his binoculars. Lanimo also quickly walked out of the shed and came to the breast wall. Through the telescope, a long, narrow, and oddly shaped raft was cutting through the waves. A rudimentary, constantly swinging wheel-like device was attached to the stern, propelled by human pedaling, and indeed much faster than ordinary rowing. There were three people on the raft, all dressed in variegated fur clothing, carrying harpoons, their faces painted with grease paint, looking fierce and savage.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a standard vessel of the Liberty Wings. It was more like a pirate or a wandering raider. They not Caesar s main force to sure how put down his binoculars and calmly assess the situation. They might be small fry who have caught wind of the situation and want to take advantage of it. Or they might be cannon fodder sent out by wings of liberty to test the waters.</p>
<p>Thought the raft stopped about 300 m from the island just at the edge of the effective range of the makeshift crossbow. A oneeyed burly man led the raft. He stood up, brandishing a harpoon towards the island, and shouted in a gruff voice, &quot;Hey, listen up, islanders. This area is now blood shark gang territory. If you know what&#x27;s good for you, hand over 30% of your food and water, and that woman, too.&quot; He pointed vaguely at Sue Chanchan, who is watching from the observation post window.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we&#x27;ll raise this wretched island to the ground. Blatant extortion and provocation. Shhal looked at Linmo with a questioning gaze. Lyno shook his head slightly and said in a low voice, &quot;Let the reserve team practice. You take command and I&#x27;ll bring up the rear.&quot; A knowing glint flashed in Shure House&#x27;s eyes, and he then made a hand gesture to those below.</p>
<p>Behind the breast work, six reserve team members gripped their weapons tightly, their breathing slightly rapid, but their eyes resolute. Having gone through previous training and sure how&#x27;s indoctrination, they knew this was their first real combat test. Sherha did not immediately order the crossbowmen to fire. Instead, following the pre-arranged plan, he first had two men raise makeshift shields made of wooden planks and sheet metal to block the gap in the breast work. Then, he personally picked up a simple megaphone made of bamboo tubes and animal hides and responded in a deep voice.</p>
<p>This is the territory of the Mayuan pavilion. Those not involved must retreat immediately. Take another step and you will be killed without mercy. His voice was loud and clear, carrying an unquestionable air of authority. The oneeyed giant paused, seemingly surprised by the other party&#x27;s forceful stance.</p>
<p>He spat and sneered. Emo Yuan pavilion. Never heard of it. Men in charge. Take the island.</p>
<p>And the goods and women are all ours. The raft started up again. The wheellike mechanism pedalling at breakneck speed, hurtling straight toward the island. The other two also raise their harpoons, yelling loudly. Archers target the drive wheel fire freely.</p>
<p>Sure how ordered. Two reserve team members armed with simple crossbows immediately peaked out from between the shields, aimed and pulled the triggers. Whoosh whoosh. One arrow missed and plunged into the water. The other, however, struck precisely at the point where the wooden axle at the stern of the raft was constantly rotating.</p>
<p>crack. The axle was not metal, but hardwood. When the crossbow bolt hit the key part, a crack appeared, and the rotation immediately became sluggish, and the speed dropped sharply. Damn it, they have crossbows, the oneeyed giant exclaimed in shock and rage. Speed up, charge.</p>
<p>Their crossbows will be useless once we get close. Although the raft slowed down, its inertia still carried it closer to about 100 m. Spearman, prepare. Sure, how ordered again. The other four reserve members put down their shields, which were then taken by the people behind them, picked up hardwood spears that were more than 3 meters long with the spearheads secured with sharpened metal plates or hard animal bones, and extended them from the firing ports in the breastwork, pointing diagonally forward.</p>
<p>The three people on the raft also became enraged, raising their harpoons and preparing to board and fight the moment they crashed into the island. Just as the raft was making its final 50 m, the oneeyed giant had already raised his harpoon, ready to throw it. Release. Shouse shouted in a low voice for spears simultaneously thrust out of the firing ports. Not at people, but at the front of the raft and near the waterline.</p>
<p>With the support of the breast work and the combined strength of the reserve team members, the spears were driven deep into the gaps between the planks of the raft. The raft&#x27;s forward momentum suddenly halted and it was even slightly lifted up by the force of the thrust. Hold on. The oneeyed man stumbled and almost fell. Just then, Sherhow personally picked up a simple crossbow that was already loaded, aimed at the oneeyed man who was swaying due to the rocking of the raft and calmly pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>Whoosh! The arrow was swift and deadly. The oneeyed giant only had time to tilt his head slightly before the arrow grazed his cheek, leaving a trail of blood, and then embedded itself deeply in the shoulder of the man behind him. &quot;Uh!&quot; A scream rang out. The successive blows completely threw this rabble into a panic. The raft was stuck with spears, unable to move forward or backward, and the threat of crossbow bolts was imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;Retreat! Retreat now!&quot; The oneeyed giant covered his face, his previous arrogance gone, and shouted horarssely. The remaining uninjured man frantically tried to reverse the wheel-like device, but the damaged axle wouldn&#x27;t cooperate. Finally, the three of them jumped off the raft and swam desperately back the way they came, abandoning the raft and their weapons. Sure, how to not order a pursuit. One should not pursue a desperate enemy, especially at sea, where the situation is unclear.</p>
<p>The reserve team members looked at the fleeing enemy in disarray, then at the enemy raft stuck on the shore, still swaying slightly. Their faces showed a mixture of excitement, tension, and a hint of lingering fear. They had won. In their first real battle, they had repelled the enemy with zero casualties. Sure house stepped down from the lookout tower and patted several team members on the shoulders.</p>
<p>Well done. But remember, this is just the beginning. Clean up the battlefield. Drag the raft up and inspect it. See if there&#x27;s anything of value.</p>
<p>Be vigilant about your surroundings in case there are any accompllices. Yes, the team members responded in unison, their morale soaring. Lyn Mo walked to Shure House side and whispered. It was handled very well. I&#x27;ve never heard of the blood shark gang.</p>
<p>It might be a newly emerged small group, or it might be a tool deliberately put out to test the waters. I will strengthen perimeter patrols and expand the early warning range. Sure house said in a deep voice. In addition, this combat exercise exposed some coordination problems and the training needs to be adjusted. Okay, you handle everything.</p>
<p>Do Lynn Mo nodded, his gaze turning to the northeast. However, after this incident, the news that we have tough guys here will probably spread even faster. The wings of freedom or anyone else one TB these small fry next time they come. Dot. He turned and looked at the strange raft being towed to shore, its rudimentary wheelike drive mechanism, making him thoughtful.</p>
<p>It seems that our ship not only needs to be sturdy, but also fast. Chapter 24. The hidden auction scene see highest bitter winds. The blood shark gangs attack was like a pebble thrown into a pond. The ripples spreading rapidly.</p>
<p>News of Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s 03 victory over the invaders and a capture of a raft equipped with a makeshift propulsion system quickly spread within certain circles. This undoubtedly served as a warning to those secretly coveting the island were hoping to gain an advantage. This island was not to be trifled with. But Lynn Emmo knew that warnings could only have a temporary deterrent. True security stemmed from strength, especially strength that transcended the current environment.</p>
<p>The construction of the storm ship was now urgent. The captured raft was towed ashore for careful examination. The rudimentary wheel-like drive mechanism inspired Linmo. Although inefficient and prone to damage, it proved that a propulsion method other than human power was feasible. He handed the disassembled parts and sketches to Sue Chian and Leeway, asking them to analyze the possibilities for improvement, at least to provide ideas for future auxiliary power systems for sailboats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he accelerated the acquisition of keel materials. Su Xian and Leewei had completed their analysis of the Sleeping Forest Abyss Sea Area, and combined with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s map, they had drawn a relatively precise coordinate range. The weather window was in 3 days, lasting approximately 48 hours. But exploration requires preparation and even more so resources, especially highquality equipment, medicine, and various tools to deal with unknown risks. Although Chandu Duo has tried her best to procure them, some items are unavailable or require specific channels.</p>
<p>It has time to ship out our goods. Lynn Mo said to Chandu Duo, &quot;Let us use some things we dye need, but that others would fight tooth and nail for to exchange for the exploration supplies we desperately need. And while weary at it, let us test the waters. Dot. She was eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Does the pavilion master mean an auction? It has not a public auction. Lynn Mo shook his head. It is a closed auction. Anonymous bidding with limited eligibility, only inviting capable and relatively reliable buyers. The items for auction must be of high quality and attractive enough, but without revealing our core secrets.</p>
<p>Brilliant. Shin Duo Duo clapped his hands. It can not only obtain urgently needed items but also screen potential partners or observe the reactions of opponents and further enhance the reputation of a moan of course under the name of my business manager Chian that right you will be in charge of this matter organized in the name of the mo yuan chamber of commerce I will give you three items for auctionlin mo list of the items the first item is a copy of the blueprint for the reinforced fishing net basic along with 10 sets of the key auxiliary material high toughness chemical fiber bundles needed for its production. Shin Duo Duo gasped, &quot;This is amazing. Food is still the highest form of currency, and a good fishing net is a golden goose.</p>
<p>Although it&#x27;s a one-time blueprint with the key ingredients, it&#x27;s enough to turn a small team around.&quot; The second item, Lin Mo continued, is 50 units of tar wood and 100 portions of Adal vice. It also includes a simple and efficient stove construction guide. Although the cold wave has passed, heating and cooked food will always be necessities. Tar wood and Adal vice are top-notch fuels and stove guides are a lifesaver. This can attract many teams that value quality of life and long-term development.</p>
<p>Dot Duo Duo quickly calculated the value. The third item Lynn Mo paused then took out a piece of leather paper with a faint metallic sheen rough bronze armor plate forging technique fragment. It record a method for initially strengthening leather defense using common copper materials and bone glue. Although incomplete, the idea is clear and has practical value. Dot.</p>
<p>This was excerpted from a tattered craftsman&#x27;s manual he had acquired through a previous transaction combined with his own understanding. It wasn&#x27;t from daily login rewards or upgrades, so he wasn&#x27;t afraid to trace its origin. In this era where metal armor was rare, any technology that improved defense was priceless. Chindwood&#x27;s breathing became heavy. Secaster, releasing these three items would be enough to make those large teams fight tooth and nail.</p>
<p>What should we exchange them for? Mainly exchange physical items. Linmo listed the items. High strength climbing ropes, professional climbing tools, portable water purifiers, high energy concentrated rations, broadspectctrum antoxin serum, raw materials, highintensity lighting equipment, underwater breathing tubes, precise compasses, and any rumors or physical specimens related to sleeping forest or ancient wood island. Understood. I&#x27;ll send out the seal bit invitation right away.</p>
<p>The location will be well that deserted trident reef in the southeast. The terrain there is complex making it easy to monitor and facilitate evacuation. The time is set from midnight tomorrow night. Doways mind was racing. I ll draft the invitation list ensuring it includes both powerful buyers and those we need to keep an eye on dot.</p>
<p>Then mont nutted. Okay. As for security, I&#x27;ll have sure lead a team to set up a perimeter to ensure nothing goes wrong. You should also be careful and bring something for self-defense. Don&#x27;t worry, master.</p>
<p>I value my life very much. Chin Duo Duo chuckled, rubbing his hands together, his eyes gleaming with excitement. This was the perfect opportunity for him to show off his skills. The news of the covert auction acted like bait thrown into the dark web, silently touching certain hidden nerves in SH 739 and the surrounding area. The next night, it was dark and windy.</p>
<p>Threeforked reef is a relatively calm body of water surrounded by three huge reefs arranged in a triangular formation. At this moment, seven or eight boats of varying sizes and styles quietly entered and stopped at their designated positions, maintaining a cautious distance from one another. Each boat was illuminated only by a dim lantern, casting indistinct shadows of people on board, but their faces were not clearly visible. Chi and Duo Duo stood on the largest central rock platform with two reserve members of the Mayuan pavilion standing behind him, both dressed in matching dark waterproof suits and expressionless. Today he had changed into a more formal dark silk robe.</p>
<p>He had somehow acquired it, his face bearing his usual amiable smile, but his eyes appeared exceptionally shrewd under the dim light. Welcome distinguished guests to the inaugural secret appraisal event of the Mo Yuan Chamber of Commerce. Shind Woodwa&#x27;s voice wasn&#x27;t loud, but it carried clearly through a metal megaphone to every ship. The rules are simple. Three rare items will be displayed in turn, and bids will be made anonymously.</p>
<p>Only exchanges of the listed items or equivalent rare intelligence will be accepted. The highest bidder wins with immediate payment and no further questions asked upon departure. any unusual activity. He paused, his gaze sweeping over the other reefs, faintly visible in the darkness will be at your own risk.&quot; As soon as he finished speaking, silence fell over the surroundings, broken only by the gentle lapping of waves against the rocks. No one questioned that those who had received the invitation and come here were novice.</p>
<p>First, the blueprint for the basic fishing net and key auxiliary materials. Chi and Doduo waved his hand and one person behind him raised a waterproof tube while another person unfolded a processed copy of the blueprint. Under the light, the detailed structural diagram and material list on it were clearly visible. After a brief silence, people on the various boats began to write, then placed the tinder documents in a small wooden boxes, which were then transported by small boat to the rocky platform. Shend Duo Duo inspected them one by one without revealing his expression.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the blueprints were traded to a medium-sized sloop for 200 units of standard timber, 50 units of stone, plus the precise coordinates of a small, highly productive oyster reef. The offer wasn&#x27;t the highest, but the accompanying coordinate information was valuable and aligned with Linmo&#x27;s intention to obtain intelligence. The second item is a guide to quality fuel packs and efficient stoves. Tar wood and adal vice were displayed and key sections of the stove guide were read aloud. The competition became noticeably fierce.</p>
<p>Warmth and cooked food are crucial for the cohesion of any team. Several boats went back and forth in bidding. And finally, a long, narrow, fast boat that looked unassuming, but whose crew moved with agility won the bid at the cost of 10 complete sets of climbing ropes and safety harnesses, five portable high brightness lanterns, and three different regional proven formulas of insect repellent herbs. Lynn Mo silently observed from a higher reef in the distance through binoculars. The speedboat didn&#x27;t resemble ordinary survivors.</p>
<p>It had a military feel to it. Were they from Dragon Soul or some other similar group? He noted this characteristic down. The last item, Chandua&#x27;s voice rose slightly with a hint of semnity. The rough bronze armor plate forging technique fragment. Those who know its value will understand.</p>
<p>When a metallic sheen leather paper was unfolded, the atmosphere visibly froze for a moment, then intensified. Defense technology in any era is a strategic resource. The bidding was fierce. No one was mentioning timber or stone anymore. The bids were all for rare physical items and highle information.</p>
<p>Five refined iron ingots, plus a record of the quarterly variation patterns in the southern magnetic storm zone. A complete set of diving equipment, 30% damaged, plus a piece of unknown hardwood core collected from the edge of the ghost algae forest. Some training tips for the S-rank talent, Swift Step, verified. plus an ancient coin salvage from 200 meters deep in the sea. The pattern on which appears to be a nautical chart.</p>
<p>The bids were increasingly astonishing. Lynmo was secretly shocked. He hadn&#x27;t expected so many strange and unusual items and information to be circulating in the market. Srank talent training notes, ancient deep sea coins. Behind these things lay untold adventures and profound secrets.</p>
<p>Just as the bidding was stabilizing and seemed to be won by the ship that offered its level talent experience plus ancient coins, a two-masted ship that had been silent from the beginning with a dark gray hull and no markings suddenly submitted a bit. Chin Duo Duo took it, opened it, and his pupils contracted slightly. He looked up at the gray ship where a figure shrouded in a cloak stood at the bow, nodding slightly. Chin Duo Duo took a deep breath and announced loudly, &quot;The final winner bids a section of the core of a century old ironwood tree about 2 ft long and half a foot in diameter, plus a 3-day measure map of the ocean currents surrounding the sleeping forest abyss. Centuries old ironwood core.</p>
<p>This is precisely one of the candidate materials needed for the keel. Although not as good as a whole century old hardwood, it is definitely an excellent alternative or auxiliary material. And the value of the actual test results is self-evident. A suppressed commotion and disappointed whispers arose from the other ships, but no one dared to question it. The piece of dark brown, densely grained, iron-like with core that had been hastily displayed, along with a nautical chart marked with detailed dates and data, were enough to prove its value.</p>
<p>The three items were successfully sold. The process was swift and quiet. The boats that won the bids quickly extinguished their lanterns and quietly sailed away. Most of those who didn&#x27;t win the bids also left in silence. A few who lingered to observe after noticing the faint reflections in the surrounding darkness.</p>
<p>The crossbow bolts set up by Sher How wisely chose to retreat as well. With their harvest, Chandu Duo returned to the reef where Linmo was located in a small boat. Master, I have accomplished my mission. Chindwood was face was a mixture of excitement and exhaustion as he handed several heavy packages. The precious ironwood core and a nautical chart to Lin Mo.</p>
<p>Besides the supplies on the list, we also got quite a few good things in exchange. That gray ship must be from the Stonemason Brotherhood. They were indeed watching us and they came out with a bang for their money. Lynn stroked the cold, hard ironwood core, then looked at the incredibly detailed ocean current map and felt reassured. This covert auction had yielded far more results than expected.</p>
<p>Have the wings of freedom arrived? He asked. They reheared. Dachshin duo duo lowered his voice. That small galley with a ram in the southeast corner is it. They kept a low profile the whole time only participating in the bidding for the armor craftsmanship.</p>
<p>But they couldn&#x27;t he beat the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood in the bidding. Their people have been observing our handover with that gray ship dot. As expected, Linmo looked in the direction where the wings of freedom ship disappeared into the darkness. They should be even more certain that we have something to do with this. However, we can worry about them for now.</p>
<p>With this piece of wood core and the measurement map, the success rate of the expedition can be increased by 20%. Notify sure how and sue Chian that as originally planned, the expedition team will set off at sunset tomorrow. Yes, with the covert auction concluded, Emmo Yuan Pavilion not only obtained muchneeded supplies, but also acquired crucial materials and intelligence. The eye of the storm has quietly shifted to the sleeping forest shrouded in mist and legend. Chapter 25.</p>
<p>The mystery begins. Shadows lurk across the land. At sunset, the expedition team set off on time. The team consists of six members. Linmo Shirhao Such Chian Leewi and two reserve members who performed best in previous training and the blood shark gang attack a Wu skilled in climbing and close combat and Shiao Chun with excellent eyesight adept at observation and setting traps.</p>
<p>Leewinio and Shien Duodo remain on the island to be responsible for defense and support. The vessel they were on was a relatively large raft that had been hastily modified. The main body was constructed of sturdy logs bound together with added side panels for protection against waves and stray arrows. A makeshift cabin built in the center using wooden poles and a waterproof tarpollen was used to store supplies and provide resting places for the crew. The stern retained a captured and modified wheel drive system which could be operated by two people to provide auxiliary power in calm conditions or when maneuvering was needed.</p>
<p>A detachable metal ram made from materials exchanged during a covert operation was added to the bow and there were three firing ports on each side. This is the best vessel that could be prepared under the current conditions. It is not fast enough, not maneuverable enough, but it is sturdy enough and carries everyone&#x27;s expectations for this expedition. Following the measured map provided by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and the weather window calculated by Sue Chanchian, the ship departed Muan Pavilion Island at dusk heading southeast. The initial voyage was calm and peaceful with the sea surface shimmering with fragmented moonlight under the night sky.</p>
<p>Apart from the monotonous sound of oars and the occasional cry of seabirds, all was quiet. Shirhao was in charge of steering and keeping watch while Such Chanchian constantly sensed the energy fluctuations in the surrounding sea and compared them with the ocean current data recorded by Leewi, making minor adjustments to the course. Lin Mo, A Woo, and Shiao Chun took turns paddling and resting to conserve their energy. The first half of the night passed peacefully. As the night progressed, fog began to quietly spread over the sea.</p>
<p>At first, it was just a thin veil, not obstructing visibility. But the fog thickened further ahead, its color gradually changing from grayish white to a strange pale blue. Visibility rapidly decreased to less than 50 m. We&#x27;ve entered the fog zone marked on the chart, Leeway said in a low voice, referring to the nautical chart. The chart says, perennial fog, easy to lose sense of direction, occasional unusual sounds.</p>
<p>It is recommended to maintain a straight course and rely on instruments for navigation. Everyone stay alert, Shir said in a deep voice, slowing the boat down. Woo! Shiao Chan, watch out for any movement on either side and under the boat. Miss Sue, do you sense anything unusual? Su Chian closed her eyes and concentrated for a moment, her brows furrowing slightly. The fog itself doesn&#x27;t have any obvious malicious energy, but it&#x27;s very heavy, creating a sense of obstruction, and my perception range is severely compressed.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some scattered life forms underwater, not very large, but very fast, seemingly swimming around us without showing any intention to attack. Lenmo took out the precise compass he had obtained in the exchange, and confirmed the direction. Maintain course. The speed can be slower. Safety first.</p>
<p>The raft moved slowly through the thick blue fog as if sailing into a secluded dreamland. Apart from the sounds of the oars cutting through the water and the creaking of the rudder, the world was silent. Even the wind seemed to be swallowed by the fog. This absolute silence was unsettling. There is a sound.</p>
<p>Shiao Chun suddenly perked up his ears and lowered his voice. It is very faint to the left front like a lot of claws scraping with duck. Everyone immediately held their breath. Sure enough, a faint but dense rustling sound came from the mist to the left, growing louder as it approached. Sure, how made a gesture, and a Woo and Shiao Chun immediately picked up the crossbows and aimed them in the direction of the sound.</p>
<p>Lyno also gripped his modified crossbow tightly. The fog swirled, and several dark shapes gradually emerged. Were they not boats, but floating logs? No, they were the carrapase of some kind of creature. There were several strange creatures similar in size to sea turtles, but with dark green shells covered in wart-like protrusions and edged with fine barbs. They floated slowly in the foggy sea, paddling with their short, thick limbs.</p>
<p>Their heads were small, their eyes were cloudy white, and they seemed to have no interest in the raft. They just mechanically swam in a certain direction, their shells rubbing against each other, making a rustling sound. It s a mist walking crab turtle sue chian breathed the sigh of relief. It s an inert creature that lives in specific foggy sea areas. It feeds on microorganisms and floating algae in the fog and it almost never attacks.</p>
<p>Its shell is very hard but its flesh is said to be poisonous. Their appearance means that we are on the right track and that this foggy sea has a stable ecosystem. Dot. It was a false alarm, but the strange creature and the oppressive environment made the atmosphere even more tense. The raft continued its journey.</p>
<p>A little over an hour later, just as dawn was breaking and the fog was at its thickest, the color of the sea ahead seemed to change. It was no longer a deep blue, but rather shimmerred with a hazy grayish green glow. We&#x27;re almost there. Leeway&#x27;s voice was a little excited. According to the actual measurement map, the seawater in the core area of the Fog Sea will appear fluorescent gray green due to the secretions of a large number of ancient tree roots and special minerals.</p>
<p>The edge of the sleeping forest abyss is nearby. Sure enough, the fog soon began to thin and visibility gradually returned. The first thing to catch the eye was a series of landscapes that abruptly appeared on the sea. They weren&#x27;t islands at all, but rather the incredibly massive root systems of trees. Like gnarl dragons, they intertwined, some above the surface, some submerged, forming a complex labyrinth forest of roots.</p>
<p>Seawater flowed among the roots, producing a murmuring hollow echo. The main trunks of these roots extend upwards, disappearing into the still thick fog, completely obscuring the treere&#x27;s crown. Each exposed root is so thick that it takes several people to encircle it. The bark is a deep iron gray covered with heavy moss and parasitic vines. The air becomes damp and heavy filled with a strong complex aroma of decaying wood earth and some kind of crisp resin.</p>
<p>My god, how big must this tree be? A Woo murmured looking up. A thousand years or even longer? Leeway stroked a nearby cold slippery route. his eyes gleaming behind his glasses. This grain, this density far surpasses ordinary hardwood. If the main trunk, find a main trunk or sufficiently thick and suitable branch.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo suppressed the shock in his heart and ordered, &quot;Sue Chian, sense which direction has the most concentrated life, energy, or wood essence.&quot; Leewi, pay attention to recording the distribution pattern of these roots and find the path leading inward. Such Chian closed her eyes again to sense, this time taking even longer. After a long while, she opened her eyes and pointed to the depths of the root forest slightly to the left. Over there, the energy reaction is very concentrated and deep, and it has a peculiar rhythm, like a heartbeat, but much slower. However, that direction also gives me a feeling of being watched.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s blurry, but it exists. Being watched, Lyn Mo&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. Was it a living being or something else? Stay alert and explore in that direction. Linmo made the decision. Oh, Sha Chun, watch out for the top and the root gaps.</p>
<p>Sure, how you cover the rear. The raft carefully navigated into the root labyrinth. The waterways were narrow and winding, sometimes requiring a long pole to push aside drooping vines or small pieces of driftwood. Light filtered through the mist above and the towering root walls, becoming dappled and indistinct. The surroundings were eerily silent, safe for the sounds of the water and their own breathing and heartbeats.</p>
<p>After venturing several hundred meters deeper, the view suddenly opened up. They had entered a relatively open body of water surrounded by a ring of giant roots. In the center of the water stood a massive broken tree trunk. The trunk was probably over 10 m in diameter. Its brake jagged and uneven as if it had been torn apart by some unimaginable force.</p>
<p>The break was five or 6 meters above the water, revealing a core of wood that was as dense as golden stone, its grains seemingly flowing with a dark golden luster. Even this small exposed portion exuded an ancient, resilient, and profound aura that far surpassed the ironwood core obtained earlier. This is it. Leeway&#x27;s voice trembled with excitement. This is definitely top grade hardwood that has withtood countless years.</p>
<p>The core of this wood is enough to serve as the main material for the keel. However, everyone&#x27;s attention was quickly drawn to something else at the break in the tree trunk. In the center of the dark gold core, there was something inlaid not a naturally formed burl or mineral, but a regular grayish white cube with sides about a foot long. The cube&#x27;s surface was smooth, and its material was neither stone nor jade. It was engraved with intricate geometric patterns and symbols so fine that they were almost indistinguishable to the naked eye.</p>
<p>Some of the symbols were also shimmering with an extremely faint cold blue light. On the wooden core surrounding the cube, there are also regular unnatural engravings like some kind of interface or energy conduction path connecting it to the cube. What is this? Shiaochin was dumbfounded. It s not a natural product. The sue changes expression was solemn.</p>
<p>The cube does not show any life energy reaction, but it emits an extremely weak yet stable energy field, which is the same as the rhythm I sensed before. It is as if it was installed inside. Lyno took a few steps closer and looked up to observe carefully. The shimmering symbols and geometric patterns were unlike any text or pattern he had ever seen, exuding a cold, futuristic sense of technology. This was definitely not something a survivor could create, and it might not even be a product of this era or this planet.</p>
<p>Is it not just ancient trees that are sleeping in a slumbering forest? Suddenly, memories flashed through his mind of Caesar&#x27;s notes about the eye of the storm, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s obsession with ancient knowledge, and a speculation about this world&#x27;s abrupt civilization selection project. Could it be that this giant tree, this cube, is related to the truth of this world? Let&#x27;s take the core first. Lyn Mo forced himself to calm down and pointed to the relatively intact area next to the cube. Be careful not to touch the cube or the surrounding markings. A Wu Shia Chan, prepare the tools and cut it from the side.</p>
<p>Leeway, measure the required dimensions. Sure, how Su Chanchian keep watch around, especially the water surface and underwater. The goal of the expedition is within reach, but a larger and deeper mystery quietly emerges with the appearance of this gray cube. Chapter 26. Giant wood dragon marrow.</p>
<p>Unexpected gain. Extracting the wood core proved more difficult than anticipated. The dark golden wood core was as hard as iron. Awou and Shiaoan took turns using the fine steel daggers and special hands saws they had exchanged to try and cut it, but progress was extremely slow. The blades could only leave shallow white marks on the surface of the wood core, and the saw blades made a sharp, piercing sound as they rubbed together, with the wood chips they brought out having a fine metallic sheen.</p>
<p>This wood is harder than iron. Aw gasped for breath, shaking his numb wrist. The density is too high. The fiber structure is incredibly tight. Leeway leaned closer to examine the cross-section, his eyes filled with amazement.</p>
<p>This is definitely a material that could only be formed after unimaginable years of sedimentation and nurturing by a special environment. If the keel of the storm ship were made of this, its strength would probably far exceed the requirements of the blueprints. Lynn Emmo cautiously observed his surroundings while calculating the time. They had been in this root labyrinth for over 4 hours. Although the thick fog had dissipated somewhat, the light was still dim, and the entire space was filled with an ancient silence.</p>
<p>Only their sounds echoed between the massive root walls, sounding particularly abrupt. Suchanian, has anything changed about that cube? Lynn Emmo asked. That gray white cube embedded in the wooden core remained his greatest source of unease. Suchanian kept her eyes fixed on the cube. Upon hearing this, she shook her head.</p>
<p>The energy field is still extremely weak and stable without any fluctuations. The surrounding markings have also not changed. But she paused, pointing to the area below the water surface. I sense that since we started cutting the wood core, some previously scattered life forms underwater seem to be slowly converging this way. They are not aggressive, but rather seem to be attracted or disturbed.</p>
<p>Speed up. Lin Mo&#x27;s heart tightened. Shhal, watch out underwater. Shirha immediately picked up his crossbow and aimed it at the water around the raft. A Woo and Shiao Chun also gritted their teeth and quickened their pace.</p>
<p>Although their efficiency was still very low. Just as they were struggling to cut, a drop of thick liquid, emitting a faint golden glow suddenly seeped out above the broken end of the wood core near the cube. The liquid slowly slid down the grain of the wood core, not fast, but with a strange texture like molten amber. What is this? Shiao Chun asked in surprise. The liquid dripped into the shallow groove they had just cut.</p>
<p>And instead of spreading out, it condensed into a small droplet like mercury, emitting a more pronounced soft golden light. At the same time, an indescribable aroma, a mixture of ancient woody fragrance, and a certain invigorating scent filled the air. Such Chian suddenly let out a soft her heart of the ocean talent clearly reacting to this aura. This thing contains extremely pure and gentle life energy. It&#x27;s not aggressive.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s more like some kind of essence. It could be very beneficial to living organisms. Lynmo&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. He gestured for a woo to carefully collect the drop of golden liquid with a clean cloth. The liquid was slightly warm to the touch, not sticky, and remained beated on the cloth.</p>
<p>Almost the instant the liquid was removed, a previously dim symbol on the surface of the gray white cube flickered extremely briefly, so quickly it was almost an illusion. The energy field around the cube seemed to experience a barely perceptible disturbance, but it quickly returned to stability. Be careful. Keep going. Lyno suppressed his doubts and gave the order.</p>
<p>The primary task now was to obtain enough dragon bone wood course. Nearly an hour later, after several people took turns working hard, they finally succeeded in cutting off a piece of wood core about 2 m long and 30 cm in diameter. This piece of wood core was exceptionally heavy, requiring four people to lift it with difficulty. Its cross-section displayed a magnificent dark gold swirling pattern, and it felt warm and solid to the touch, as if it contained infinite power. The main keel material has arrived.</p>
<p>Just as everyone was preparing to move the wood core onto the raft, another unexpected event occurred. Splash! Suddenly, the water surface not far behind them exploded. A dark red tentacle as thick as an adult&#x27;s waist and covered with suckers shot out and wrapped around the piece of wood core that had just been cut off with lightning speed. &quot;Watch out!&quot; Sherhow reacted extremely quickly, firing the crossbow bolt almost instinctively, which accurately struck the middle of the tentacle. Thud, the arrow pierced the flesh, but the tentacle only trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Instead of loosening its grip, it tightened its coils and dragged the object underwater. &quot;It&#x27;s a giant octopus. Protect the core.&quot; Lynn Emmo shouted, raising his modified crossbow and aiming at the point where the tentacles connected to the water surface, firing continuously. A Wu and Shiaun also reacted and swung their knives at the tentacles. However, the tentacles were incredibly resilient.</p>
<p>Cutting into them was like striking thick water- soaked leather, leaving only shallow wounds. The wood core was dragged down into the water. At this critical moment, Su Chian suddenly made an unexpected move. She forcefully threw the piece of cloth that had just collected the golden liquid at the thick tentacle. The cloth landed precisely on the area densely covered with tentacles and suckers, instantly staining it with the golden liquid that had been clinging to it.</p>
<p>The next moment, something astonishing happened. The ferocious tentacles convulsed violently as if splashed with boiling oil, their suckers contracting sharply, and the grip on the wood core suddenly loosened. Not only that, but the tentacles also seem to have encountered something extremely repulsive or terrifying, quickly retracting back underwater, taking with him the crossbow bolt that Sherha shot at it, leaving only a rapidly spreading ripple on the murky water and a faint smell of blood. That liquid can drive it away. Leeway was still in shock.</p>
<p>It s not driving it away. Su Chian stared at the water s surface sensing the rapidly receding massive life forms reaction. It s more like suppression or interference. That octopuses s life energy was very strong but after being touched by the golden liquid it showed obvious disorder and retreat. This liquid may have a special restraining or repulsive effect on certain aquatic creatures die.</p>
<p>Lynn and Mo looked at the calmed water surface, then at Su Chanchian. The value of this golden liquid was probably greater than they had imagined. Quickly secure the wooden core to the raft. We need to leave immediately. Sherhow made a decisive decision.</p>
<p>Without delay, everyone worked together to secure the heavy wooden core to the center of the raft with ropes and covered it with a waterproof tarpollen. The raft&#x27;s water line had noticeably sunk, but the structure remained relatively stable. Lyn Mo took one last look at the broken section of the giant tree and the still silent gray cube. This mysterious place held far more secrets than this. But now they had to return safely with their spoils.</p>
<p>The raft changed direction and sped away along the waterway it had come from. Perhaps it was the lingering scent of the golden liquid that had an effect. Or perhaps the retreat of the giant octopus had intimidated other creatures. The return journey was exceptionally smooth, and they encountered no further attacks. When they finally emerged from the root maze and re-entered the relatively thin blue fog, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It was already bright outside, and although the fog remained, visibility had improved significantly. &quot;It&#x27;s a success.&quot; Shiaoin couldn&#x27;t help but exclaimed softly, his face beaming with excitement. Au also wiped his sweat and grinned. Lewi eyes carefully examined the wrapped wooden core, his eyes filled with fascination. Sherhow remained vigilant, steering the raft.</p>
<p>Su Chian leaned against the side of the cabin, her face somewhat pale. The prolonged concentration had taken a toll on her. Lin Mo sat at the bow of the boat, stroking the small bottle containing the golden liquid in his arms. He had transferred the liquid into a small bamboo tube on the raft. This expedition had yielded far more than expected.</p>
<p>the most crucial keel material in this unexpected mysterious golden liquid. His gaze turned towards the direction of Mauuan Pavilion Island. With the keel in place, the construction of the storm ship would be on the fast track. He had a vague feeling that this sleeping forest and the mysterious cube were intricately connected to the truth behind this world. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood providing the map was probably not just a simple matter of exchanging information.</p>
<p>Just then, Shiao Chan, who was on lookout duty, suddenly whispered, &quot;Master, there seems to be a ship to our right. It&#x27;s not very clear in the fog, but there&#x27;s more than one.&quot; Everyone tensed up instantly. Sherhow immediately changed direction, trying to use the fog and rocks for cover. Lynmo raised his binoculars and looked through the thin fog. The silhouettes of several ships were clearly visible, moving slowly, seemingly heading towards the sleeping forest abyss.</p>
<p>The ship shapes looked somewhat familiar. Is it the Wings of Liberty or some other faction that also received the news? Lynmo&#x27;s eyes turned slightly cold. It seemed that this seemingly secluded ancient wood abyss had more observers in the shadows than he had imagined. &quot;Speed up, bypass them, and head straight back to the island,&quot; Lin Mo ordered. With a combined assistance of wheel drive and paddles, the raft silently changed course, gliding into the thicker fog like a ghost.</p>
<p>Behind them, the mysterious ship shadows were gradually swallowed up by the thick fog and disappeared. But Linmo knew that the undercurrents never stopped surging. The dragon bones and the drop of golden liquid they brought back may become the key to stirring up even greater waves. Chapter 27. Dragon marrow tempering.</p>
<p>The beginning of ship forging. The heavy raft carrying six exhausted but invigorated people slowly approached the shore under the afternoon sun. Leewencio and Shin Duo Duo, who had already received the news and were eagerly waiting, immediately led their men to meet them when the waterproof tarpollen covering the raft was lifted, revealing the huge dark gold core of wood with swirling patterns and an aura of semnity. Everyone held their breath. This this is the dragon bone.</p>
<p>Chi Dudwa&#x27;s eyes widened, wanting to reach out and touch it, but he was also a little hesitant. A thousand-year-old tree. Its marrow dormant that Leewi gently stroke the smooth solid cross-section. His tone filled with awe. Its hardness far surpasses iron and stone.</p>
<p>Its depth is immeasurable. With this as its backbone, the foundation of ship is as solid as a rock. Leewinio quickly recorded the various data of the wood core and carefully took some extremely fine wood shavings left over from the cutting process from her brother, preparing to conduct further observation. Sure, how a Woo! And Shiao Chun quickly moved the wood core to a specially cleared flat area on the island, using stones to prop it up and prevent it from getting damp. Linmo didn&#x27;t rest.</p>
<p>He first handed the bamboo tube containing the golden liquid to Sue Chian, asking her and Leewi to study it together and figure out its properties and possible uses. Then he immediately convened a meeting of the core members. Inside the shed, the fire in the stove dispelled the chill and fatigue from everyone. With the keel in hand, the construction of the storm ship can officially begin. Lynn Mo got straight to the point, projecting the keel treatment requirements from the blueprints using the simple projection function of his bracelet.</p>
<p>The first step is to preliminarily shape and temper this piece of wood. The blueprints require alternating tempering with earth fire or deep sea cold currents to remove impurities and unleash the wood&#x27;s potential so that it can withstand the weight of the future hull and the storms at sea. Subterranean fire, deep sea cold current. Chandu Duo was dumbfounded. Where are we supposed to find this? It should be a symbolic description, Sue Chian pondered.</p>
<p>It probably refers to the alternating stimulation of extremely hot and extremely cold environments, which changes the internal structure of wood, making it more resilient. The energy storage crystal micro we obtained before might be able to simulate the effect of energy shock, but it has far from enough dot. And that golden liquid leeway suddenly interjected excitedly. Changan and I have done some preliminary testing and the liquid contains extremely pure life energy and it seems to have a natural affinity and penetrating effect on wood. If it is diluted or processed and combined with specific temperature changes, it might achieve a similar effect to stimulating potential.</p>
<p>Linmo&#x27;s eyes lit up. Do you have a specific plan? We need to experiment, Suchian said cautiously. We can start by testing with the scraps left over from cutting the wood core to find the best ratio and process, but this will take time and we will also need some auxiliary materials to control the temperature and energy input. I&#x27;ll take care of the materials. Shin Duo Duo immediately patted his chest.</p>
<p>Make a list of what you need. All right, Leeway Sue Chian, you two are in charge of testing the dragon marrow tempering program. The sooner the better. Lynn, Emo, assign the tasks. Chandu Duo cooperate fully.</p>
<p>At the same time, continue to collect information on other core materials needed to build the sailboat, especially information on things like star pattern steel and tough whale stomach pouch that we&#x27;ve never even heard of. Sure, how Lyno looked at the silent defense commander. The island&#x27;s defenses cannot be relaxed. The wings of freedom may have already noticed our actions. Ship building is our most vulnerable time and we must ensure that everything is foolproof.</p>
<p>In addition, the reserve teams training must continue. In the future, we will need sailors who can fight on ships. Understood that. Sure. How noted.</p>
<p>The defense system has completed its third round of reinforcement, and the early warning range has been expanded to 5 km. I will allocate some personnel to begin basic naval combat and ship handling training. However, he paused. If we really want to build such a large ship, our current manpower is far from enough. Whether it as craftsmen or sailors, this was precisely the question Lynn Mo was pondering.</p>
<p>The storm ship was no small raft. Its complexity required a professional team of craftsmen and a considerable number of sailors to operate. The Mo Yuan Pavilion currently had fewer than 40 core members and peripheral members combined, each with their own responsibilities. I&#x27;ll figure out the manpower problem. Lyno already had a plan in mind, but the premise is that we must first come up with something tangible, even if it&#x27;s just a prototype to attract truly capable people to join us.</p>
<p>After the meeting, everyone immediately got back to their work. Leewi and Sue Chanchian set up a makeshift experimental shed in a corner of the island. They divided the scraps of the wood core into dozens of small pieces and began experimenting with soaking them in golden liquid diluted in different proportions. Then they tried roasting them over charcoal, chilling them with sea water, and even using the tiny energy storage crystal to stimulate them with gentle energy pulses. They meticulously recorded the changes in the hardness, toughness, weight, and even the energy field of the wood blocks after each experiment.</p>
<p>The process was tedious and monotonous, but the two enjoyed it immensely. Chandu Duo, armed with a long list, began his frantic operation. On one hand, he acquired common high-grade timber, metals, ropes, and canvas through normal channels. On the other hand, he used various covert informants to offer high rewards for information on unheard of materials. He even risked contacting several factions he had previously interacted with during the covert auction, offering non-core technical data such as improved furnace blueprints or rare resources, a small amount of tarwood in exchange for tentative inquiries about items like star pattern steel.</p>
<p>Sherhow strengthened patrols and lookouts on the island and began compiling a simplified naval combat manual and basic sailing operation outline. He divided the reserve team members into small groups using existing rafts and captured converted boats to train in formation, turning, boarding, and naval firing with crossbows in the nearby waters. The training was intense, but no one complained. Everyone knew that their future lay at sea. Lynn Mo himself was engrossed in the more detailed parts of the stormship blueprints.</p>
<p>He needed to plan the construction steps, the site, and the manpower and resources required for each stage. At the same time, he was also closely monitoring the outside world. Dragon Soul Steel Gun sent another message confirming that the Wings of Freedom had been frequently active in the southeastern part of the SH739 area recently, seemingly searching for something and had clashed with several small factions, annexing two of them. Caesar&#x27;s whereabouts were unknown, but he was believed to be planning a major operation sufficient to change the regional landscape. Dragon&#x27;s Soul intensified its surveillance of the wings of freedom and once again reminded Lynn and Mo to be careful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, like a pebble thrown into a lake, vanished without a trace after the secret auction and delivery of the map and the wooden core as if it had never existed. Lin Mo tried to convey information through several intermediaries left by Chiandu Duo who seemed to be related to him, expressing his willingness to further discuss the cube and the ancient wood, but all his efforts were in vain. 3 days later, Lewi and Su Chanchians experiment made a breakthrough. They found a relatively feasible tempering method, infusing the golden liquid into a specially treated deep sea salt solution in a specific ratio to create a pale golden tempering liquid. The wood was then soaked in this liquid for 12 hours, quickly transferred to a specially designed charcoal kiln and baked at a relatively uniform medium temperature for 6 hours before being rapidly immersed in icycater for quick cooling.</p>
<p>This process was repeated three times. The edges and corners of the wood treated in this way have their hardness increased by about 15%, their toughness increased by 20% and their moisture absorption rates significantly reduced. They also emit a faint, calming, and refreshing scent. This should be what the blueprints refer to as unleashing potential. Sue Chian pointed to the test data.</p>
<p>Tired but excited. Although it is not as powerful as the real Earth fire cold current, the effect is already very significant. If the entire keel is treated in this way, its performance will be sufficient to meet or even exceed the basic construction requirements. Is the consumption of the golden liquid high? Lynmo was more concerned about this. The liquid seemed to be non-renewable.</p>
<p>If we process the entire keel, we ll probably use up about a third of our stock. Leeway estimated. However, we could try to recycle some of the quenching fluid or find alternative plant essences with similar effects that let us use this. Lynn Mo decided decisively start preparing to temper the dragon bone. Chandu duo assist in building a sufficiently large tempering shed and charcoal kiln.</p>
<p>Sure. How allocate manpower to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the tempering process? Yes. As the order was given, a vacant lot in the center of the island where materials have been stored was quickly cleared. A huge shed built with wood, stones, and thick tar pollen rose from the ground with soaking pools and drainage ditches dug inside. Next to it, a charcoal kiln with a relatively complex structure emphasizing uniform temperature and air tightness was also being built.</p>
<p>All the work was proceeding in a tense but orderly manner. The sounds of hammering, sawing, and shouting filled the island day and night as if a miniature vibrant shipyard was breaking ground. The dark golden dragon bone lay quietly in the center of the shed, awaiting the transformative tempering that was about to take place. It will carry not just a ship, but also the ambition and hope of a new era. Lynn and Mo stood outside the shed, watching the sunset turn the sea into a golden red hue.</p>
<p>Dragon bone tempering is only the first step. The real storm is slowly gathering below the horizon in the distance. You had to get the ship on its journey before the storm fully arrived. Chapter 28. Tempering and testing gold.</p>
<p>All ranks of officers join us. The tempering of the dragon bone began on a windless dawn. Inside the massive workshop, the atmosphere was solemn. In a soaking pool, the pale golden quenching liquid rippled gently, exuding a unique aroma, blending sea salt, resin, and a mysterious golden liquid. The section of dark golden dragon bone, suspended by a speciallymade wooden frame, slowly sank into the pool.</p>
<p>The moment the liquid touched the surface of the wood core, it emitted a soft hissing sound as if parched earth were drinking in sweet rain. The originally calm luster of the wood core seemed to flicker. Soaking begins time for 12 hours. Leeway stared at a simple water clock marked with an hourglass and engravings. His voice tense.</p>
<p>This process had only been tested on scraps. Using it on complete kees would result in incalculable losses if it failed. Linmo such sure how and Shandu were all present. Chando Duo even temporarily suspended his business network to personally guard the place, saying, &quot;This is the future of our Moyuan pavilion, more important than any business deal.&quot; The wait was long. Outside the workshed, the island&#x27;s operations continued uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Sherhow increased the number of sentry posts by 30% and all reserve team members were put on high alert. Their rest days canled. Aw and Shiao Chan along with several quick-witted new recruits patrolled continuously within five nautical miles of the island in modified rafts. Su Chian occasionally closed her eyes to sense the energy and reported to Lin Mo, &quot;The energy permeation is very even and the activity inside the wood core is slowly increasing with no signs of rejection or disorder.&quot; Lynn Emmo nodded, his gaze never leaving the soaking pool. He knew this was only the first step.</p>
<p>12 hours later, with the combined efforts of several people, the keel was slowly hoisted up. At this moment, its color seemed to have deepened and its surface was covered with a layer of crystalline liquid film, which shimmerred with a pale golden light under the torches in the workshop. Move it into the charcoal kiln. The charcoal kiln had been preheated for some time, and the internal temperature was controlled by Lee Wei&#x27;s meticulously designed ceramic ventilation pipes and charcoal piles in different locations to ensure uniformity. The kiln frame was carefully placed on a speciallymade stone platform inside the kiln and the kiln door was sealed with heavy stone slabs and wet mud.</p>
<p>The baking stage lasts 6 hours. Every half hour, the temperature and changes on the surface of the wood core must be checked through the observation hole. Leewi&#x27;s face was flushed from the heat of the kiln, but his eyes were focused. The roasting stage demands even more patience and control. Team members responsible for watching the fire take turns standing guard beside the kiln, peering intently through a narrow observation hole at the section of Keelin&#x27;s side, which appears to be burning silently in a dim glow of the embers.</p>
<p>The temperature cannot be too high, or will carbone eyes, nor can it be too low, or its potential will not be unlocked. Time tick by. The shed was eerily quiet, save for the occasional crackling of the charcoal fire and the suppressed breathing of the workers. In the fourth hour, the observer suddenly exclaimed, &quot;Something&#x27;s changed.&quot; The grain on the surface of the wood core seems to be moving. Lynn Emmo immediately moved closer to the observation hole.</p>
<p>Inside the kiln, the dark golden patterns on the surface of the keel seemed to come alive, flowing and unfolding extremely slowly, as if undergoing some kind of deep awakening under the high temperature. The originally dense would seem to have become more translucent and a more complex internal structure could be faintly seen. It&#x27;s the quenching fluid and heat at work reshaping the wood fibers. Maintain the temperature. Absolutely.</p>
<p>No flexions. The last two hours were especially agonizing. As the last grain of sand fell from the water clock, Leewi practically roared, &quot;Times up. Shut down. Prepare for rapid cooling.&quot; The icy sea water prepared in advance and drawn from the deep sea was quickly channeled into the diversion channel at the bottom of the charcoal kiln, overflowing the still scorching stone platform in Keel.</p>
<p>White steam billowed up instantly filling the entire shed and the scalding water droplets splashed onto people&#x27;s faces stinging. Back off be careful of burns. Sure, how shouted directing the group. The steam lingered for a full 15 minutes before gradually dissipating. When the kiln door was reopened, a complex aroma, a blend of smoky, fishy, and cool woody scents wafted it out.</p>
<p>The dragon bone lay quietly on the stone platform, still warm to the touch. Its appearance was no longer the same. The color changed from dark gold to a more restrained and deep dark brown. But upon closer inspection, occasional glints of golden light could still be seen deep within the texture. The surface was as smooth as a mirror, and the touch was no longer warm and smooth, but rather carried a cool jade-like quality.</p>
<p>The overall size seemed to have shrunk slightly, but the sense of solidity and weight had been elevated to several levels. It was as if it were not wood, but some kind of strange metal that had been forged through countless trials. Success. Leewei was the first to rush forward using a speciallymade hardness testing tool, a pendulum with different metal tips attached to tap different parts of the keel. Listening to the crisp and uniform ding-ding sounds that came back, he was overjoyed.</p>
<p>The hardness has increased by at least 20%. The structure is uniform and dense without any flaws. This is simply a perfect keel blank. Suchan also reached out to touch it. Her heart of the ocean could sense that this section of dragon bone contained a stable and powerful vitality like a dormant volcano that once awakened would surely erupt with astonishing power.</p>
<p>Lynmo breathed a long sigh of relief. The most crucial and also the most uncertain step had been successfully completed. Immediately begin the second soaking and quenching cycle. He suppressed his excitement and ordered, according to the plan, complete three rounds of quenching to achieve the best results. With the experience of the first success, the subsequent tempering process went much more smoothly.</p>
<p>By the time the third round of rapid cooling was completed, and the entire keel was completely stable, 2 days and one night had passed. The dragon skeleton that was finally presented to everyone was over 2 m long and about 25 cm in diameter. Its entire body was a simple and heavy dark brown. But when it was turned in the light, tiny golden specks could be seen shimmering inside like stars. It lay there quietly, naturally becoming the center of the entire workshop and even the entire island, exuding a calm and awe inspiring aura.</p>
<p>The backbone of the storm ship is complete. Just as everyone was gathered around the dragon bone, basking in the joy of their success, Au, who had gone out on patrol, hurriedly returned and reported to Shir How and Lyno, sect leader, instructor Shir, about 8 nautical miles to the southwest, we found a small, badly damaged raft with two people on it, one unconscious and the other seriously injured. Judging from their clothing and remaining equipment, they seem to be from a regular military unit. They claim to know instructor. Sure, sure.</p>
<p>Howal frowned. You know me, take me to see you. Lynn Emmo followed. In a makeshift medical tent on the west side of the island, Lynn Mo saw the two uninvited guests. The raft was indeed dilapitated, almost falling apart.</p>
<p>The unconscious one was a young man, pale-faced and barely breathing. The seriously injured one was a man in his 30s with a hideous old scar on his face. One of his arms was twisted unnaturally and multiple wounds on his body were still bleeding but his eyes were still sharp. When he saw sure how enter he was clearly stunned for a moment then struggled to sit up. Iron wall is it really you? The scarman&#x27;s voice was horsearo filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Sure how strode forward and pressed him down. Don&#x27;t move. You&#x27;re iron hammer. It&#x27;s me. The scarred man.</p>
<p>Xiao Tai became excited, which aggravated his wound, causing him to grimace in pain, but his eyes shone brightly. I never thought I&#x27;d be alive to see my old company commander again. It turned out that Ziao Tai and the unconscious young man Lu Foam were both former subordinates of Sherhow from their old military unit. They were drawn into this world a few months after Sherhow and struggled to survive. Later, they joined a small mutual aid group mainly composed of veterans.</p>
<p>But just 3 days ago, their settlement was attacked by a detachment of the Wings of Freedom. The group was scattered and there were heavy casualties. Ziaoai and Luong fought desperately to steal a raft and escaped. They drifted at sea for 2 days, running out of ammunition and food. Then they encountered a small storm which damaged the raft.</p>
<p>Luong was seriously injured and unconscious and was also about to collapse when they were discovered by Woos Patrol. Those bastards from Wings of Liberty. Xiao Tai gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with hatred. There were too many of them. Their equipment was better.</p>
<p>And there was that leader who could generate electricity. We took down seven or eight of them, but still. Sha&#x27;s expression was somber. He patted Jiao Tai&#x27;s uninjured shoulder and said, &quot;It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re alive. It&#x27;s safe here.</p>
<p>Focus on recovering first.&quot; Then listened quietly. The appearance of two well-trained and trusted veterans at this critical juncture was like sending charcoal in snowy weather, especially since they had a blood feud with the Wings of Freedom. Their loyalty and fighting spirit were beyond doubt. Sure, how you&#x27;re in charge of settling them in. Lyn Mo said, &quot;Once they&#x27;ve recovered, they can join the Mo Yuan Pavilion if they&#x27;re willing.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re short of trustworthy, capable brothers here.&quot; Ziaoai looked at Lynmo, then at Shhow. Shhound nodded to him. This is Lin Mo, the pavilion master of Mo Yuan Pavilion. Saving us was his order. Perhaps this place can give us these scattered soldiers a new organization.</p>
<p>Ziaoai struggled and with a still functioning hand gave Lin Mo a somewhat distorted military salute. Seleia and Luon will never forget your life-saving grace. As long as we can avenge the wings of freedom, this life will belong to the Mo Yuan Pavilion from now on. Lynn Emmo nodded. Focus on healing your injuries first.</p>
<p>Once you&#x27;re healed, there will be a time for you to lend a hand. Leaving a medical tent, Linmo felt more at ease. With the dragon bone successfully tempered and two reliable veterans unexpectedly acquired, the strength of the Mo Yuon pavilion was gradually being solidified. He looked up at the larger shipolding shed that was being built. The dragon skeleton is complete.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s time to add muscles and scales to this spine, making it a true dragon capable of tearing through the waves. The blood debts owed by Wings of Liberty have reached the point where they must be settled. Chapter 29 stars steal hard to find. Old enemies come knocking. The successfully forged KE was placed in a newly built, more spacious and sturdy central shed supported by a speciallymade wooden frame and covered with dust proof tarpolin.</p>
<p>Like a sleeping giant, it quietly awaits to be awakened and become the backbone of a colossal ship. But having a spine isn&#x27;t enough. You also need muscles, flesh, and sails. Each of the other core materials listed on the storm ship blueprints is just as difficult to obtain as the keel. Lynn Mo gathered the core members and spread out the blueprints again in a temporary meeting shed next to the workshed.</p>
<p>The keel is complete. Next is the main frame and hull.lin mo pointed to the complex structural diagram on the blueprints. Three main materials are needed. First, star pattern steel as the main skeleton and loadbearing structure which requires high strength, toughness, and a certain degree of corrosion resistance. Second, deep sea ironwood for connection and reinforcement of some key nodes, which needs to be dense and heavy.</p>
<p>And third, composite material treated with stomach bladder for the whole hole and lining, which requires to be waterproof, impact resistant, and have a certain degree of self healing ability. Dot. Chando duo looked at these names, and the habitual smile on his chubby face turns somewhat bitter. Secaster, I&#x27;ve hardly ever heard a star pattern steel and tough-kinned whale stomach pouch. Deep sea sinking ironwood is more of a story.</p>
<p>It said that some can occasionally be salvaged near the deep sea trenches in several southern regions, but the quantity is scarce. The price is extremely high and the salvage risk is huge. Su Chian pondered, &quot;I seem to have sensed a similar substance in some very ancient marine creature memory fragments. It has a special metal formed over a long period of time by the secretions of lava snails that live in the deep sea and feed on specific minerals. combined with seabed veins.</p>
<p>Its surface has star-shaped patterns, but we can&#x27;t te reach that depth and pressure at present. Dot. Leeway adjusted his glasses. The blueprints indicate alternative solutions. Star pattern steel can be replaced by refined iron supplemented with star sand through casting, but its performance will decrease by about 30%.</p>
<p>Thick skinned whale stomach can be replaced by multi-layer treated giant sea lizard skin or thick canvas impregnated with mixed glue. but its self-repairing ability will be lost. There is currently no clear alternative to deep sea sunken Ironwood. Having an alternative is better than having no hope at all. Shiendu Duo Linmo said, &quot;Looking at his external affairs steward, your primary task is to use all resources and connections at any cost to gather information on the appearance of star sand and giant sea lizard as well as the exact location or acquisition channels of deep sea ironwood.</p>
<p>We should also start stockpiling large quantities of basic materials such as refined iron, thick canvas, and glue dot. Understood. Chiand Duo nodded emphatically, a resolute glint in his eyes. I&#x27;ll personally visit several black markets and underground intelligence points. Even if I have to dig 3 ft into the ground, I&#x27;ll dig out the clues.</p>
<p>Sure, how Linmo turned to the defense commander. Defense is of paramount importance during ship building. Once Shiaoai and Lu Foong recover from their injuries, they will be assigned to your defense unit. We are still short-handed, but we must be selective and not overqualified. Increase the frequency and scope of maritime patrols, especially in the southeast direction.</p>
<p>The wings of Liberty stronghold is in that direction, and Caesar will not let this go easily. Dot. Yes, Xiaoai and Luong are in good condition and can immediately form combat capability after recovering from their injuries. I have adjusted the patrol plan and added nighttime patrols and rapid response teams. Sherhow reported.</p>
<p>In addition, water combat training has been extended to all reserve members and they have initially mastered basic formation and boarding tactics. Suchanian Leewei Linimo said turning to the researchers and scholars, &quot;You too continue to study the blueprints in depth, refine every construction step, and plan ahead for the allocation of sites, tools, and manpower. At the same time, try to study other possible uses for that golden liquid and continue to pay attention to the sleeping forest abyss direction. I always feel that things are not over yet. Such Chian nodded.</p>
<p>Besides its remarkable effect on wood, we have initially discovered that the golden liquid also has a slight activating effect on some common metals which may play a little role in the casting of star pattern steel. As for a sleeping forest abyss, I&#x27;ve kept a whisp of my perception there, and there are no abnormalities so far, but that cube still makes me uneasy. After the meeting, everyone returned to their busy work. Chin Duo Duo practically lived in his business intelligence center, a shed piled high with all sorts of transaction records and intelligence fragments. He poured out vast resources and promises through various channels, frantically searching for information on those few rare materials.</p>
<p>After several days, the results were meager, but not entirely fruitless. Regarding Star Sand, an old fisherman who has been navigating the dangerous waters of the South for many years claims that on certain moonlit nights near Thunder Point, some silvery sand grains that shimmer with a faint light are occasionally washed up on the beach. They&#x27;re suspected to be fragments of some kind of meteorite or deep sea minerals, but the quantity is extremely small, and the risk of collecting them is extremely high. Thunder Point, as its name suggests, has extremely bad weather. Regarding the giant sea lizard, there are rumors that large lizard-like creatures roam the waters on the edge of the rotten swamp west of the SH 800 area.</p>
<p>They have thick skin and flesh, but are not very aggressive. However, the swamp is filled with poisonous gas and has a complex aquatic environment. As for the deep sea sunken Ironwood, there is a relatively certain but disheartening piece of news. In the depths of the Devil&#x27;s Trench, where the SH739 and SH 740 areas meet, an expedition team once used a speciallymade troll net to retrieve a small section of the wood. The wood was jet black like iron and sank immediately upon entering the water.</p>
<p>However, the Devil&#x27;s Trench has rapid and turbulent currents and is often frequented by large predators. So, there has been no record of a large-scale successful salvage operation to date. Chi and Duo Duo organized these fragmented but valuable pieces of information and reported them to Linmo. Each piece of information was accompanied by enormous risks. Lynmo looked at the intelligence report, his face ashen.</p>
<p>The path to ship building was indeed fraught with difficulties. But no matter how hard it was, he had to keep going. Just as he was weighing whether to risk collecting star sand and giant sea lizard skin first or to concentrate his efforts on trying to salvage sunken ironwood, Su Chian brought him even more urgent bad news. Lynn Mo, my sensor network has detected an anomaly. Such Chanchian hurriedly found Lin Mo, who is inspecting the progress of the construction site.</p>
<p>Her face grave. To the southeast, about 30 nautical miles away, there&#x27;s a fleet of more than 10 ships moving in our direction. They are not moving fast, but their formation is tight. Three of them have very strong energy reactions, especially the one in the middle, which is emitting obvious and aggressive lightning fluctuations. It&#x27;s Caesar.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s come in person. They finally arrived. Lyn Mo&#x27;s eyes turned cold. And this wasn&#x27;t a probing harassment. Caesar himself was leading the team and its scale far exceeded the last one.</p>
<p>Can you determine their exact target? Is it us or someone else? Lynn Emmo asked, &quot;The course is heading straight for our island with no signs of deviating midway.&quot; Sue Chanchian affirmed. We expect to arrive around noon tomorrow at the earliest. Also, the energy reactions of two ships in the fleet are very strange. They&#x27;re not combat ships. They seem more like transport ships or engineering vessels.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t make a specific judgment. An engineering vessel? What is Caesar planning? A full-scale assault or Lynn Mo immediately summoned all core members. The main force of the Wings of Liberty is attacking, led by Caesar himself. They are expected to arrive by noon tomorrow, Linmo said succinctly. Sure, how proceed with a level one combat readiness plan.</p>
<p>All non-combat personnel, take cover. Combat personnel, take your positions. Check all defensive facilities, weapons, and arrows. Yes, Shaw did not hesitate at all and immediately turn around to make arrangements. Chin Duo Duo, immediately cease all external trading activities.</p>
<p>Recall all personnel and supplies currently outside the area. Take inventory and prepare for a long-term standoff. Understood. Chin Duo Duo also stopped smiling and quickly left. Su Chian Leewi, you take Lee Winio and the other non-combat personnel into the underground storage room, the hidden space dug during the island upgrade and shed construction and protect the blueprints and important data.</p>
<p>Close the observation station to avoid becoming a target. And what about you? Su Chanchian asked Lin Mo. I&#x27;m with Sure. How? Lynn and Mo said calmly. Also tell Ziao Tai and Lu Phone that if their injuries don&#x27;t affect their actions, they should report to the breast work.</p>
<p>We need everyone who can fight. Su Chian opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she just nodded. Be careful. Caesar&#x27;s thunder fury has a large range. Don&#x27;t try to tank it.</p>
<p>I know. As the crowd dispersed, the island was filled with the sounds of hurried but orderly footsteps, commands, and the movement of equipment. The firing ports behind the breast work were inspected again. Crossbows were cocked, and boulders and logs were moved to appropriate positions. All the rafts patrolling the sea were withdrawn and instead stakes and barricades were deployed near the shore.</p>
<p>As night fell, the island was brightly lit. Most of the light was blocked by a speciallymade windproof cover and everyone was making final preparations for the upcoming battle. Lynmo stood on the reinforced lookout tower, gazing at the pitch black southeastern sea. Did Caesar choose this moment to launch a major attack because he had calculated the critical period of their ship building and wanted to destroy the foundation of the Mo Yuan pavilion in one fell swoop? Or did he have other plans? Those two strange engineering ships always gave him a bad feeling. He touched the bottle of golden liquid that was almost empty at his waist and then looked at the sleeping dragon bone in the shed.</p>
<p>A storm is coming. His ship was not yet completed. This battle will be the most severe test since the founding of the Moyuan Pavilion. Chapter 30. Battle on the raging seas.</p>
<p>First sail appears. The darkness before dawn is the thickest. The island of Muan Pavilion is like a tranquil eyelet before a storm with only the sound of waves gently lapping against the rocks, suppressed breathing, and the occasional clash of weapons. All non-combat personnel had entered the underground storage room. Behind the breast work, Sherhow led more than 30 combat personnel to their positions, including Ziao Tai and Lou Fong, who despite their injuries, insisted on fighting.</p>
<p>Crossbows were knocked, rammed, earth stones were in place, and oil canisters were neatly arranged on the newly built wooden watchtowers. Observers stared intently at the southeastern horizon. Lyn Mo and Shir how stood side by side on the central watchtower. The sea breeze carried a salty fishy smell and also a faint unsettling restlessness. &quot;They&#x27;re here,&quot; Shir House said in a low voice, handing the binoculars to Lenmo.</p>
<p>At the horizon, where the sea meets the sky in the east, a row of moving black dots first appeared, gradually becoming clearer in the faint morning light. There were more ships than Su Chian had sensed, at least 15 or 16. The largest, a two-masted sailing ship, was in the center. its hole clearly reinforced. The menacing metal ram at its bow gleamed coldly in the dawn light, and the tall figure standing at the bow was none other than Caesar.</p>
<p>On either side of him were four slightly smaller but equally heavily armed or sailed warships. Even more alarming were the six strange ships on the flanks of the fleet. They had no sails, low holes, thick iron plates covering their prows, and a deep draft resembling some kind of specially designed ramming vessels. The two engineering ships Sue Chanchchan had mentioned followed at the rear, seemingly piled high with miscellaneous items, their contents unclear. Those six ramming ships are heading straight for our coastal defenses.</p>
<p>Dot sure how saw through their intentions at a glance. They want to force their way ashore and create an opening. Those two engineering vessels are probably not simple. Dot order. All balliste prioritize targeting the ramming ships and prevent them from approaching.</p>
<p>Archers, fire freely at approaching enemy soldiers. Stones and oil await my command. Lynn Mos calm voice traveled through a simple communication system to each defensive section. The wings of Liberty&#x27;s fleet deployed about 500 meters from the island. Without shouting or negotiating, Caesar clearly had no intention of wasting words.</p>
<p>He stood at the bow, arms outstretched, and fine arcs of blue white electricity began to crackle and pop around him. The violent energy fluctuations could be felt even from a distance. Attack! Caesar&#x27;s roar boomed like thunder, carrying far and wide. The six ramming ships took the lead, their orarsmen moving in unison, charging towards the island&#x27;s relatively weak western and southern sides like arrows released from a bow. At the same time, the archers on the four warships began to hurl arrows.</p>
<p>Though the distance was still far and the accuracy was insufficient, the intention was to suppress them. Ballast guns fire. Shh gave the order decisively. Behind the island&#x27;s breast work from modified heavy ballisti made of some refined iron and hardwood emitted a dull creek of their mechanisms. Their arm thick crossbows whistling through the air as they slammed into the two leading ramming ships.</p>
<p>Boom! Crack! One ramming ship was struck squarely on the bow by a crossbow bolt. The immense impact caused the bow to lurch downwards, reducing its speed drastically. The metal sheet caved in and the hull groaned under the strain. Another ship was grazed by a crossbow bolt which tore a large gash in its side. Seawater rushed in and chaos erupted on board, but the remaining four ramming ships had closed to within 200 m.</p>
<p>The wings of Liberty members on board raised their shields to fend off the stray arrows and howled as they accelerated. Archers, aim at the orsmen and helmsmen, free fire, the commanders roared. Arrows rained down, and although most were blocked by shields, some people were still hit and fell, and the speed of the ramming ship was slightly affected. Just then, on the flagship where Caesar was, the electric arcs suddenly intensified. He clenched his fists, and a thick blinding blue white bolt of lightning burst forth from his hands, slicing across the sea with a destructive aura and striking a section of the western breast work of the island.</p>
<p>&quot;Get out of the way!&quot; Sure House shouted sharply. But the thunder were too fast. Ba O N. Amidst the deafening explosion, a gap nearly 2 m wide was blasted open in the breast work, which was made of stone and wood. Debris and wood chips flew everywhere, and several nearby soldiers were thrown over by the blast wave, screaming in agony.</p>
<p>Haha. easily defeated, Caesar laughed wildly, the arcs of electricity around him dimming slightly, but his aura growing even stronger. Charge! Slaughter them all. A breach appeared on the west side, drastically increasing the defensive pressure. Seeing an opportunity, the two ramming ships, disregarding the crossbow bolts and falling rocks, desperately charged towards the brereech.</p>
<p>&quot;Plug the brereech,&quot; Lyno leaped down from the central watchtower and rushed towards the brereech himself. Sherhow followed closely behind. Smoke and dust filled the brereech and several wounded defenders struggled to their feet. Linmo and Sherhow arrived with a team of reserves and quickly used spare wooden stakes and stones to block the brereech while simultaneously forming a temporary defensive line with shields. Hold on, they won&#x27;t get up there so easily.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo shouted to bolster morale. The first ramming ship crashed heavily into the reef outside the brereech. Its bow shattered, but the dozen or so elite wings of Liberty soldiers on board had already jumped off the ship, waiting through the water and charging forward, wielding knives and axes. Kill sure how roared, wielding a heavy shield and battle axe, and was the first to charge forward like a moving iron wall, instantly knocking down two enemies. Lynn Mo, wielding a modified crossbow, calmly fired continuous bursts, targeting the enemy&#x27;s leaders and range shooters.</p>
<p>The reserve team members also mustered their courage, raised their spears, and fought alongside the landing enemy. A chaotic battle immediately erupted at the brereech. The wings of freedom were fierce and valiant, but the defenders of my pavilion, thanks to the terrain, their temporary fortifications, and the support of the valiant general Shir How and Lin Mo&#x27;s precise long-range attacks managed to hold their ground. But Caesar wouldn&#x27;t let them catch their breath. Seeing that the landing was blocked, he snorted coldly and once again gathered arcs of electricity in his hands.</p>
<p>This time his target was the conspicuous workshop in the center of the island where the tempered dragon bones were stored. &quot;Stop him!&quot; Suchians anxious voice suddenly rang out through the megaphone. &quot;He&#x27;s aiming at the dragon bone.&quot; Lyn Mo&#x27;s heart tightened, but he was currently embroiled in close combat and unable to break free. Just as Caesar&#x27;s thunder was about to erupt again, a strange low humming sound suddenly came from the east side of the island near the workshed. Immediately afterwards, a pale golden semi-transparent barrier like an inverted bull instantly enveloped the entire workshed and the surrounding area of several dozen meters.</p>
<p>What? Caesar&#x27;s lightning struck the pale gold barrier, exploding into a blinding burst of electricity. But the barrier only rippled violently a few times and did not break. It was Sue Chanchian using the remaining golden liquid combined with the simple energy guiding array she had previously researched made from energy storage crystals and specific minerals and with the precise control of the heart of the ocean. She activated this temporary protective barrier at the critical moment. But her face instantly turned ashen, clearly indicating a huge drain on her energy.</p>
<p>Caesar was both shocked and furious. Unleashing thunderous fury twice in a row had been a considerable burden for him. His eyes flashed with a fierce light as he looked at the two engineering ships that had remained stationary at the rear of the fleet. Charge it. Use the island crusher to smash that turtle shell and the shed to pieces.</p>
<p>The two engineering vessels slowly moved forward, and only then could one see that their bows were not simple rams, but rather suspended by an enormous pendulum made of hardwood and iron chains with sharp iron spikes covering its head. As the winches on the vessels turned, the terrifying island crushing hammer was slowly pulled up, ready to be unleashed. This is a siege weapon specifically designed to destroy the foundations and buildings of an island. If hit by this giant hammer, not only will the sheds and ke be destroyed, but the island itself may also suffer severe damage. Everyone&#x27;s heart was in their throat.</p>
<p>Just in this moment of despair, a resolute glint flashed in Linmo&#x27;s eyes. He roared in the megaphone. A Wu Shiao Chun, now activate Storm Fong. Stormfong? What is that? Even Sherha was stunned for a moment. On the east side of the island, beneath a newly built simple wooden pier extending into the sea, the seawater suddenly churned violently.</p>
<p>A huge streamlined black shadow abruptly broke through the surface of the water like a long, dormant, deepseam monster, revealing its ferocious side. That&#x27;s the bow of a ship. To be precise, it was a distinctive triangular rammed bow section of the storm ship that had been initially completed and temporarily fixed to a reinforced massive wooden raft chassis hidden underwater. At this moment, the securing cables to the raft chassis were cut and the temporarily installed man-powered paddle wheels on both sides of the bow spun wildly, propelling this halfdeformed strange ship like an arrow shot diagonally towards the two engineering vessels that were preparing to use the island crushing hammer. This was a secret project that Lynn Mo and Leewi carried out simultaneously while building the keel using existing materials to prioritize the construction of the most offensive bow section as a surprise weapon in critical moments.</p>
<p>Although it only has a bow without power or control and can only charge in a straight line once, its ironclad icecracker-shaped triangular ram as well as its own heavy mass is the most terrifying weapon. The Wings of Freedom had no idea that something like this was lurking underwater. By the time they discovered it, the terrifying storm fong was already within reach. Boom! Crack! The terrifying impact drowned out everything. The steel ram slammed into the vulnerable side of an engineering vessel, sending chips and whole debris flying everywhere.</p>
<p>The vessel was thrown sideways, listing severely. Its island breaker went out of control. The chain snapped and a heavy hammer slammed onto the deck causing screams and further destruction. Another engineering vessel was also affected in the chaos. It made a mistake, releasing its island breaker prematurely, only to strike empty air.</p>
<p>The enormous reaction force caused the vessel to rock violently. The surprise attack was a success. The most threatening siege equipment was instantly rendered useless. Well done. Shirhow was greatly encouraged and took the opportunity to lead the defending troops to push the enemy back a bit more at the breach.</p>
<p>Caesar witnessed this scene and his eyes widened in fury. His carefully prepared trump card had been thwarted by the opponent in such an unbelievable way. The continuous defeats and energy depletion brought his violent temper to its peak. Then Montac, I&#x27;ll kill you. He roared, no longer caring about the energy he was expending.</p>
<p>Arcs of electricity surged wildly around him, showing signs of spiraling out of control like a thunder god descending to earth. He leaped from the bow of the ship, his feet treading on exploding lightning and pounced towards the center of the island, towards Linmo&#x27;s location. He was going to personally take action and crush everything with absolute power. The real crisis has only just begun. Lynamo looked up at the ferocious figure that was rushing towards him with immense power and thunder, his eyes sharp as knives.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath, gripped the modified crossbow tightly, and in the crossbows mortise on the tip of the last arrow was smeared with the last bit of unused golden liquid. Kizar, let me see if your thunder is fury or my deeper schemes prevail. Chapter 31. Thunderous golden arrow. The defeat of the wolf.</p>
<p>Caesar, accompanied by thunderous force, lunged through the air. That wasn&#x27;t a leap. It was more like a brief, violent glide. The lightning beneath his feet exploded in the air, producing a series of booming sounds, and wherever he passed, a brief white trail was plowed across the sea. His ferocious momentum seemed poised to tear the entire island apart.</p>
<p>His target was clear Lin Mo, the culprit who had repeatedly thwarted his plans, causing him heavy losses and humiliation. Pavilion master, be careful. Sherhow&#x27;s eyes were bloodshot as he tried to rush over, but he was held back by two fearless wings of freedom warriors. The other defenders were also stunned by this scene that resembled divine punishment, and their attacks came to a halt. Facing this terrifying pressure, Lynn Mo remained unusually calm.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t even take a step back, but steadily raised the improved crossbow in his hand. The roughwood grain on the crossbow was clearly visible under the blinding electric light surrounding Caesar. In the crossbow mortise, the arrow coated with a last drop of golden liquid reflected a strange warm golden luster under the electric light, a stark contrast to Caesar&#x27;s furious blue white lightning. The distance was rapidly closing. Caesar&#x27;s sinister grin and the mad killing intent in his eyes were clearly visible.</p>
<p>His right hand was bent like a claw, gathering a blinding ball of lightning that was extremely unstable and seemed ready to explode at any moment. And he grabbed Lyn Mo&#x27;s head. 50 m, 30 m, 20 m. Now Linmo pulled the trigger. The movements were not fast, even somewhat slow with a peculiar rhythm.</p>
<p>Whoosh! The arrow left the bow string without a piercing sound. Instead, it seemed to float lightly, drawing an almost straight golden line as it headed towards the destructive ball of lightning and Caesar&#x27;s ferocious face behind it. A hint of disdain flashed in Caesar&#x27;s eyes. A mere wooden arrow dared to defy his thunder. He neither dodged nor avoided the lightning ball, its momentum unddeinished, intending to blast the man and the arrow into dust.</p>
<p>However, just as the lightning ball was about to touch the arrow, a sudden change occurred. The liquid on the golden arrow seemed to be instantly activated by the energy of the lightning ball. There was no explosion, no impact, but it suddenly spread out, turning into an extremely thin yet incredibly tough golden light film. Like the most skillful fishing net, gently catching the violent lightning ball sizzle. The earpiercing crackling of electricity turned muffled and distorted.</p>
<p>The lightning ball seemed to be stuck in an invisible quagmire. Its forward speed suddenly reduced and the electric light on its surface flickered and struggled wildly, but could not tear apart the seemingly fragile light membrane. On the contrary, the golden patterns flowing on the light membrane seemed to come alive and began to frantically suck the energy of a lightning ball. What? Caesar&#x27;s sinister smile froze instantly, replaced by incredulous astonishment. He felt his condensed lightning power being rapidly neutralized and devoured.</p>
<p>The golden light membrane not only blocked the attack, but was also counteracting his power. This sudden turn of events caused Caesar&#x27;s forward momentum to momentarily halt and become disordered. The lightning beneath his feet flickered erratically and his figure swayed slightly in the air. It&#x27;s that momentary stagnation. After shooting that arrow, Linmo didn&#x27;t even look at the result.</p>
<p>Instead, he suddenly fell to the side and rolled over. Not far behind where he had been standing, there was a pile of spare stones that Sherhow had previously directed to be stacked up and a sharpened hardwood shot stuck diagonally in the ground. Caesar was shaken by the obstruction of his lightning strike and lost his primary target due to Linmo&#x27;s dodge. The momentum of his forward charge had not completely dissipated and the unstable electric current beneath his feet further exacerbated his condition. Not good.</p>
<p>Alarm bells rang in Caesar&#x27;s mind. He forcefully turned his body, tried to regain control of the direction, but it was already too late. Laugh. He dodged the pile of rocks, but his left arm couldn&#x27;t completely avoid the angled hardwood shodafreeze. His left arm, crackling with electricity, grazed the sharp wooden tip.</p>
<p>H. A sharp pain shot through him. Even with the electric art protecting him, the specially treated iron hardened tip of the wood still tore through his flesh, leaving a deep wound that exposed the bone. Blood gushed out instantly, only to be burned and evaporated by the violent electric arc, emitting a burnt smell. More importantly, this impact completely disrupted his balance and the flow of his power.</p>
<p>Thumb. Caesar could no longer maintain that brief glide and crashed awkwardly onto the beach a few meters in front of where Lyno had just stood, splashing up a large amount of muddy water and sand. The arcs of electricity around his body instantly dimmed, became chaotic and flickered erratically, clearly suffering a significant backlash. &quot;Chief!&quot; came an exclamation from the distant wings of Liberty ship. Lynmo had already quickly rolled over and stood up holding a machete he had picked up from a fallen enemy nearby.</p>
<p>His eyes coldly fixed on Caesar who was struggling to get up. On the other side, Sherhow finally dealt with the entangled enemy covered in blood and strode over with his battle axe forming a pinser attack with Lenmo. Caesar, clutching his bleeding left arm, knelt into shallow water, his face a mixture of excruciating pain, rage, and an indescribable fear. He stared intently at Lin Mo, then at the gruesome wound on his arm and the fading arcs of electricity around him. He knew he had lost.</p>
<p>Not only had he lost this long planned attack, but in the direct confrontation, his proud talent had been destroyed in a bizarre way, and he had also suffered a serious injury. The surprise attack by Storm Fong destroyed the siege equipment. A mysterious pale gold barrier blocked his thunderous attack. That damned golden arrow actually managed to counter his thunderous fury. Finally, he was forced to land in such a sorry state, finding himself in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>If the fight continues and he is not in good condition on the opponent&#x27;s home turf while that burly man named Sherhow is closing in, the consequences could be unpredictable. Retreat. Caesar practically spat out the words through clenched teeth. His voice and filled with resentment, he abruptly activated the remaining electric arcs within his body. Hap-hazardly unleashing several scattered bolts of electricity towards the approaching Shirhao and Lynmo.</p>
<p>Then, without looking back, he turned and staggered towards the nearest warship. The electric bolts were greatly weakened and easily blocked by a Shure House shield. Despite their numerical superiority, the wings of Liberty&#x27;s fleet was hampered by the wounded and defeated leader. The destruction of their siege equipment and significant losses at the breach in their landing force. Morale had plummeted.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the order to retreat, they were overjoyed, turning their ships around to fetch the wounded Caesar and the remaining troops on a beach, hastily making their way back. Try to run. Shh&#x27;s eyes blazed with killing intent, and he was about to lead his men in pursuit. Don&#x27;t pursue a desperate enemy. Lynn Mo stopped him, watching the wings of freedom fleet rapidly disappear into the distance and shook his head.</p>
<p>Although Caesar is wounded, he still has fighting power. They have more ships and if we chase after them and engage in a naval battle, we won&#x27;t gain any advantage. We have already achieved our objective to defend the island, preserve the keel, and severely damage Caesar. He glanced at the ordinary machete in his hand, then looked in the direction Caesar had fled. That arrow had completely depleted the golden liquid, but its effect was unexpectedly good, seemingly having a special restraining and neutralizing effect on Caesar&#x27;s lightning energy.</p>
<p>This gave him a new approach to dealing with this formidable enemy in the future. Sherow took a few deep breaths, suppressing the urge to pursue, and nodded, saying, &quot;What the SECM master says is true. first strengthen the defenses and treat the wounded. The battle was over, but the island was in ruins. The breach in the western breast work needed urgent repair.</p>
<p>The wounded needed treatment, and the consumed arrows and supplies needed to be inventoried and replenished. The air was thick with the pungent smell of blood, burnt flesh, and the stench of the sea. Supported by Lee Wio, Su Chanchian, pale-faced, stepped out of the underground bunker. maintaining the pale gold barrier had almost exhausted all her mental and physical strength. &quot;Sister Chanchan, are you all right?&quot; Lewo asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s nothing, just exhaustion.&quot; Su Chanchian waved her hand, her gaze immediately turning to Lyn Emmo, seeing that he was unharmed. The worry in her eyes subsided slightly. Then she looked towards the workshe. The dragon bone is intact. Lyn Mo walked over and nodded to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to you.&quot; A faint smile appeared on Su Chanchians pale face. She then looked in the direction Caesar had fled, her brows furrowing slightly, his thunderous fury is very doineering, but it seems to put a great strain on him as well. This time he was unexpectedly restrained by the golden liquid and was injured. He probably won&#x27;t dare to use his full strength easily in the short term. However, given his personality, he will never give up easily.</p>
<p>I know that Lin Emmo gazed at the sea where the wings of freedom as fleet had become distant dots. Therefore, we must be faster. The storm ships must be built before he returns. He turned to look at the group of people who, though exhausted, still had resolute eyes, and spoke in a clear and powerful voice. Clean up the battlefield, treat the wounded, and repair the defenses.</p>
<p>Assess the losses and replenish supplies. All participants will be commended and rewarded. Rest for half a day and tomorrow we&#x27;ll begin full-scale ship building. Yes. The crowd responded in unison, their relief at surviving the ordeal and their hopes for the future intertwined on every face, whether stained with blood or smoke.</p>
<p>The wolf has retreated, but its fangs remain. The response from auan pavilion will be to forge sharp blades and sturdy ships that can crush all storms. The sea breeze carries the blood of victory, but also the clarion call of a new journey. Chapter 32. Setting sail, king of the storm.</p>
<p>5 days after the battle, Miuan Pavilion Island had largely returned to order. The damaged breast works have been repaired to be even thicker, and additional wooden corner towers have been added. The remains of the fallen were properly buried at sea, and the wounded were gradually recovering under the herbal remedies prepared by Suchian and the meticulous care of Lewio. A faint smell of scorched earth still lingered in the air. But there was now a stronger sense of resilience, as if the battlefield had been reborn.</p>
<p>Inside the central workshop, the keel, now fully tempered, was once again solemnly placed on a speciallymade platform. Around it lay piles of materials Chandu Duo had painstakingly collected over the past few days, almost emptying his coffers through various channels. Preliminarily selected hardwood, large bundles of ropes soaked in tar and resin, iron and copper ingots gather from various places. Thick high strength canvas and some strange but potentially usable substitutes such as several large preliminarily tanned supposedly giant sea lizard hides and a small bag of shimmering stardust fragments. Leewi and Sue Chanchan practically lived in the workshed, working day and night, calculating, simulating, debating, and recalculating, all while facing the spread out blueprint of the storm ship in a mountain of materials.</p>
<p>The KE was the backbone, but to make it a real ship, it needed to be precise down to the angle of every rib, the curvature of every plank, and the strength of every joint. An alternative to star pattern steel is to use refined iron mixed with stardust powder combined with the residual activity of that golden liquid and then forged it three times. Theoretically, it can achieve 70% of the performance, but it requires at least three skilled blacksmiths in a stable high temperature furnace. Leewi pointed to the whole skeleton on the blueprint. His eyes bloodshot, but his expression was excited.</p>
<p>The replacement for the stomach pouch of the basil whale is made of three layers of giant sea lizard skin with a canvas soaked in a mixed adhesive made from fish bladder resin and a golden liquid thinner sandwiched in between. The edges are sewn together with copper nails and leather ropes. It has past waterproof and impact resistance tests, but its self-repairing ability can only be achieved by applying maintenance agents regularly. Sue Chanchin added. Her face was still a little pale, but her eyes were focused.</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;s the manpower?&quot; Linmo asked. This was the biggest bottleneck. Even if a ship on the blueprints were built to the smallest possible specifications, it wouldn&#x27;t be something that the current few dozen people could complete. The basic framework and outer shell installation will require at least 20 people with basic carpentry and ironwork skills working day and night and is expected to take a month. The internal structure, masts, rigging, and sales will require even more and more specialized craftsmen, Leewwayi said frankly.</p>
<p>Linmo was silent for a moment, then looked at Shen Duo Duo. Old Shen, how many people can you recruit? No matter what method you use, as long as they&#x27;re truly skilled, hardworking, and have a relatively clean background, they will be treated well, and their families will be protected. Chando Duo licked his slightly chapped lips. a glint of shrewdness in his eyes. We&#x27;ve built up quite a network of contact through previous secret auctions and regular transactions.</p>
<p>Some small teams are struggling and some artisans are being exploited by powerful forces. As long as we&#x27;re willing to pay high prices and provide a safe environment, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to build a team of 30 or 40 artisans. It&#x27;s just that the consumption of food and supplies will be terrifying. I&#x27;ll figure out the supplies. Lin mo look to sure.</p>
<p>Sure. How? Select a group of people from the reserve team and the existing personnel who are quick-witted and have strong learning abilities to work alongside the craftsman and learn on the job. We need our own sailors and we also need our own ship builders. Understood. 15 people have been initially selected.</p>
<p>Sure. How nodded. In addition, Ziaoai and Lu Fong are recovering quickly and can be incorporated into the core defense team. All right. Lyn Mo took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Pass down the order. Mo Yuan Pavilion officially launched the storm ship project. All resources should be prioritized for ship building. Shandu Duo, I want to see the first batch of craftsmen on the island within 3 days. Leeway Sue Chian produce the final simplified and feasible firstphase construction blueprints and material list.</p>
<p>Sure, how the island&#x27;s defense and internal order are entrusted to you. The order was like a mountain and the entire Miuan pavilion like a tightly wound machine suddenly accelerated its operation. Chin Duo Duo displayed astonishing power through several clandestine intermediaries. He spread the message that Mayuan Pavilion is sincerely recruiting various craftsmen with high salaries, including room and board protection and equal treatment for their families. along with some enticing pictures of the offerings such as ample food, clean temporary sheds, and complete fortifications.</p>
<p>At the same time, he personally contacted several experienced carpenters and blacksmiths he had previously scouted and had complained about the area on the regional channel, promising them substantial rewards. In just 2 days, seven or eight ships of varying sizes carrying anxious yet expectant craftsmen and their families sailed towards Mayuen Pavilion Island. sure how led his men in a rigorous screening process, verifying skills and eliminating any suspicious individuals. Ultimately, the first batch of 32 craftsmen and their 19 family members were accepted onto the island. Most of these people were emaciated, their eyes reflecting the weariness of a long struggle for survival and weariness of their new environment.</p>
<p>However, when they saw the island&#x27;s wellorganized offenses, ample logistical support, and the dragon bone exuding an extraordinary aura in the central workshop, the light in their eyes gradually brightened. Construction officially began amidst the noisy yet orderly clanging sounds. The tempered keel was carefully placed on a pre-dug angled dock slide utilizing a modified beach terrain. Following the simplified blueprints refined by Lee Weii and Sue Chanchan, the craftsman began crafting precisely curved ribs from treated hardwood, tenoning them on a both sides of a keel, gradually unfolding the skeleton of a giant beast. Blacksmiths, sweating profusely in a makeshift shed, repeatedly forged connectors and reinforcements according to a formula mixed with stardust.</p>
<p>Due to the island&#x27;s limited area, much of the pre-treatment work had to be carried out on nearby rocky beaches or temporary platforms over the water. Wood chips flew everywhere. Hammers clanged, and shouts echoed throughout the area. Lyn Mo slept only three or four hours a day, shuttling between different work sections, solving practical problems, coordinating resources, and boosting morale. His calmness, decisiveness, and profound understanding of the blueprints quickly earned him the respect of the craftsman.</p>
<p>In addition to providing technical guidance, Sue Chanchian also had another important task to use the heart of the ocean and the newly built observation station to closely monitor the surrounding sea area, especially the possible retaliation from the wings of freedom, as well as the unease that the heart of the ocean vaguely sensed, which originated from the depths of the ocean. 10 days later, the skeleton of the storm ship had taken shape. The dark brown keel, like a spine, extended from both sides with dense and sturdy ribs, outlining a long, flowing, and powerful hull. Although it did not yet have an outer shell, the massive and intricate skeleton already filled everyone involved in its construction with awe and pride. That evening, Su Chanchian found Lin Emo, who was inspecting the progress of the shipyard, and his expression was more serious than usual.</p>
<p>Lynmo. My senses are becoming clearer and clearer, she whispered, the sea breeze ruffling her bangs. It is not the wings of freedom. It has the ocean itself, the heart of the ocean issuing a warning. An unprecedented malevolent biological tide is gathering in the deep sea and its direction seems to cover the entire SH 739 and the adjacent area.</p>
<p>The timing may be within the next few days. Its intensity far exceeds the last marine invasion. Linmo&#x27;s heart sank. Internal troubles, wings of freedom were not yet resolved, and now external threats were looming. And these were unpredictable, widespread, natural disaster-like threats.</p>
<p>Can you be more precise? For example, the main direction of impact. Is there a pattern? Su Chian shook her head. It&#x27;s very blurry, like a deep sea storm brewing. I can only feel the malice almost tangible slowly rising. Perhaps it&#x27;s related to the anomaly of the sleeping forest abyss cube.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s just a periodic disaster in this world. She paused, looking at the naent ship skeleton. Will our ship make it in time? Lyn Mo gazed at the ship&#x27;s hull, which gleamed with a metallic sheen in the setting sun, and then looked at the busy yet hopeful figures around him. Even if it&#x27;s too late, it has to be just in time, he said firmly. Notify everyone to speed up the construction.</p>
<p>Two shifts a day and night. Sure. How? Raise the defense level to the highest level and prepare to deal with the sea monsters attack. Shin duo duo. Spare no effort to ensure the supply of materials, especially arrows, oil, and reinforcement materials.</p>
<p>A sense of crisis lashed at everyone like an invisible whip. The construction site was brightly lit all night, and the shouts and hammering grew more urgent. Everyone understood that they were racing against disaster. On the third day after the warning of the marine mammal tide, the hole was mostly laid and the base of the main mast was fixed. The ship on which high hopes were placed was already showing its fierce yet beautiful prototype, a streamlined hole, towering mast base, and many reserved firing ports and ballista positions.</p>
<p>On that very day, Su Chian&#x27;s warning came true. The alarm bell at the observation station blared piercingly at noon. Leeway&#x27;s roar echoed across the entire island through the megaphone. Southeast southwest. Massive high-speed life reactions.</p>
<p>The numbers are incalculable. It&#x27;s a marine mammal tide. A real marine mammal tide. Everyone stopped what they were doing and looked out at the sea. At first, the horizon was just a rolling white line.</p>
<p>But soon that white line transformed into a surging boiling black tide. Not seaater, but a death tide of countless marine creatures, diverse in species and size, yet all radiating a ferocious hostility. There were enormous bony fish with monstrous backs, octopuses and squid with waving tentacles and glowing red eyes, sea crabs with black shells as large as millstones, and even the dorsal fins of several large predators could be seen faintly visible amidst the horde. Their target seems to be all the islands in this sea area that exude an aura of civilization. All personnel to defensive positions, non-combat personnel to take cover.</p>
<p>Sherhow&#x27;s roar overwhelmed the initial panic. Almost at the same time the order was given, the vanguard of the first wave of beasts crashed hard into the defenses of Muan Pavilion Island. Boom! Crash! The breast works trembled violently and waves carrying ferocious sea creatures crashed onto the shore. Crossbow bolts whistled, boulders tumbled down, and oil canisters exploded into seas of fire. The battle instantly intensified.</p>
<p>This time, the sea monsters were even more ferocious and reckless than the last invasion. They seemed to be driven by some invisible force, charging forward wave after wave. Lynmo, crossbow in hand, stood behind the breast work, firing continuously, targeting the largest individuals that seemed to have a commanding role. Sure, how like a pillar of strength, appeared wherever the defense was drained. each swing of his battle axe, claiming the lives of several sea beasts.</p>
<p>Ziaoai, Luong, Au, Shiao, Chun, and other core combatants also held their ground fiercely on the front line. However, the number of sea monsters was simply too great. The defenses were in dire straits in many places, and casualties began to appear. Worse still, the observation station where Sue Chanchian was located due to its high position seemed to have attracted the attention of more flying sea creatures such as giant sea bats and mutated seabirds and was besieged in an imminent danger. Linmo saw the critical situation and his eyes sharpened.</p>
<p>He suddenly turned around and shouted to the team members behind him who were operating the heavy crossbows, &quot;Turn the cannons around. Aim at the sea in front of the observation post and fire a barrage. Open up As master, that place belongs to us. The team member was taken back. Execute the order, Lin Mo commanded without hesitation, shouting into the megaphone.</p>
<p>Su Chian, Libanchu, prepare to rap hell down the cliff behind the observation station. I&#x27;ll meet you, the Bisti roared, creating a blank space amidst the swarm of sea monsters in front of the observation post. Linmo along with a Woo and several skilled men used ropes and rails that had been laid out throughout the island to quickly maneuver behind the observation post, braving the swarms of sea monsters and arrows. When he arrived, Sue Chanchian and Lee Wio had just packed the last batch of important data and were preparing to slide down the rope. Several huge sea bats were flapping their wings, trying to break through the wooden windows of the observation station.</p>
<p>&quot;Jump down!&quot; Linmo shouted from below, spreading out a makeshift net. Without hesitation, Sue Chian shielded Lewio and leaped into the net. Almost simultaneously, the window of the observation station shattered and sea bats swooped in with shrill cries. Lyn Mo caught the two and quickly retreated. A Woo and the others used crossbows to drive back the pursuing sea beasts.</p>
<p>Thank you, Su Chanchian said, still shaken and pale, but clutching the file folder tightly to her chest. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re all right, Lin Mo replied briefly, covering their retreat back to the relatively safe central workshed area. Just then, sure how, who have been fighting on the front lines sent an urgent report. SECM master, the eastern defense line has been breached. A large sea monster has landed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a sea king suspected to be a hammerhead whale. Hammerhead whale shark. Adults can exceed 10 meters in length with a head like a giant hammer and terrifying impact force. Lynn Mo&#x27;s heart tightened. Not far behind the eastern defense line was the unfinished storm sailboat dock.</p>
<p>Sure, Hal, stop it at all costs. Don&#x27;t let it get close to the dock. Lin Mo ordered urgently while glancing at Sue Chian, who was still in shock beside him. A bold plan flashed through his mind in an instant. Chan, can your heart of the ocean try to interfere with that behemoth even just for a moment? Su Chanhan looked at Linmo then at the east side where terrifying impact sounds and screams were coming from and gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll try, but I need to get close enough and it might exhaust my energy and even cause a backlash. I&#x27;ll protect you, Lynn Mo said decisively. Oh, take the remaining Molotov cocktails and all the crossbow bolts and come with me. The eastern defensive line was in complete disarray. A section of the breast work had been completely smashed down, and a colossal gray black beast the size of a small boat and with a flat hammer-like head was rampaging through the shallows, leaving defenders in ruins.</p>
<p>Sherhow and his elite troops, including Xiaoai, fought desperately, but ordinary weapons were unable to inflict fatal damage on it. Linmo protected Sue Chanchian using the terrain and cover to quickly approach. They stopped behind a reef about 50 meters away from the giant beast. Now Lynmo said to Sue Chanchian, raising his crossbow and aiming at the giant beast&#x27;s relatively vulnerable eyes. Such Chanchian closed her eyes and fully activated the heart of the ocean.</p>
<p>An invisible wave of mental energy mixed with her strong intention to expel and soothe spread like ripples towards the raging hammerhead whale shark. The behemoth&#x27;s forward charge suddenly halted, its massive head swaying from side to side, seemingly confused and agitated, disrupting the rhythm of its attack. Now Lynmo pulled the trigger. A Woo and the others also threw Molotov cocktails and fired crossbow bolts. Molotov cocktails struck the behemoth, exploding into bursts of flame.</p>
<p>Crossbow bolts pierced its eyelids, mouth, and other vulnerable spots. The excruciating pain and disruption caused the behemoth to roar in anger. It abandoned its attempt to break through the defenses, abruptly turned its massive body around, plunged into the deep water, and covered in flames and wounds, swam towards the open sea, leaving behind a scene of devastation and a chance to catch its breath. It&#x27;s a success. Aw couldn&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>Su Chanchians body went limp and she collapsed to the side. Lynn Mo quickly caught her only to find her face deathly pale, her breathing weak, and she had already fainted. Forcibly interfering with such a powerful sea beast had taken too much of strain on her. Take her back to rest. Quickly, Lin Mo handed Sue Chanchan over to Lee Wio, who had rushed over.</p>
<p>Having repelled the hammerhead whale shark, the pressure on the eastern defensive line was greatly reduced. Sherhow and his men took the opportunity to repair the breach and reorganize the defense. Meanwhile, the sea monster tide seemed to have lost its leader behemoth and coupled with the prolonged siege. Its offensive began to gradually weaken and recede. As the last sea monster disappeared into the waves, darkness fell once more.</p>
<p>The island of Mayuin pavilion rire of blood and acurate smells littered with the marks of battle and the weary wounded. But they had held on. They had defended their homeland and they had defended that unfinished ship of hope. Post battle inventory revealed that casualties were higher than expected, but most core members were unharmed. Suchanian was in a coma due to exhaustion and needs time to recover.</p>
<p>Lynn Immo stood on the broken parapet, gazing at the gradually calming yet still deep sea and at the sailboat whose skeletal frame was revealed in the twilight. He turned on his bracelet and the island information was clearly displayed. Island level LV4 20 m. Materials required to upgrade to LV5. Completed.</p>
<p>Special requirement successfully repelled a massive marine mammal tide. Completed. All conditions are met. Do you wish to upgrade to LV5? You have been detected as the first survivor globally to meet the requirements for upgrading to LV5. A serverwide announcement will be made upon upgrading, and you will receive additional rare rewards.</p>
<p>Hide your personal information. This time, Lynn Mo did not choose to hide it. He calmly typed his real name, upgrade. The next moment, the island expanded again, becoming more stable and its functions more complete. And that grand global announcement once again resounded in the minds of all the survivors.</p>
<p>Global announcement. Congratulations to survivor Lynn Mo for becoming the first person in the world to upgrade the island to LV5. Reward omitted awarded the exclusive title king of a storm. The moment the announcement rang out, Lynn Mo felt an invisible, immense power surge upon him, as if he had formed a deeper connection with the surrounding sea breeze and waves. On his bracelet, the emblem representing his title, King of Storms, Beginner, shone brightly.</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked southeast toward the direction of the wings of Freedom&#x27;s old lair, and also toward the deeper distance where the turbulent sea and the eye of the storm were hidden. The King of Storms has been officially crowned. His ship is about to brave all obstacles and sail into a new era that is both magnificent and fraught with danger. On the distant sea, the members of the Muan Pavilion, who had just experienced a great battle, were stunned when they heard the announcement and then burst into thunderous cheers. It&#x27;s the pavilion master, the king of storms, then Montac.</p>
<p>We won. We held on. In the crowd, Sue Chian, who is slowly waking up and being supported by Lee Wangio, looked at the tall and lonely figure on the breastwork wall. A complex and relieved smile appeared on her pale face. Whether it&#x27;s Mr.</p>
<p>J or Lyno, he eventually stepped into the limelight and became the king of this sea, a position that no one could ignore. Chapter 33. Sailing against the wind and waves. The sailor&#x27;s tale. King of storms.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo. This name along with the massive ship&#x27;s skeleton whose menacing outline began to emerge in the twilight and smoke stirred up unimaginable waves in SH 739 and even the wider seas like a spark thrown into boiling oil. The regional and global channels were in an uproar. A mix of emotions, questioning, amazement, insults, worship, fear, and curiosity was palpable, and the information flooded the screen so fast that even the wristband felt slightly warm. Then Montac.</p>
<p>Is that the mysterious Jay? He really built a huge ship. How is that possible? King of Storms. What an imposing title. He repelled the Wings of Liberty. What about Caesar? Is the MO Yuan Pavilion still accepting members? I want to join.</p>
<p>The connection between the once mysterious Mr. J and the now high-profile King of Storms, Linmo, has an impact far exceeding that of a simple serverwide announcement. This signifies that a leader possessing top tier individual strength. Powerful resource acquisition capabilities successfully resisted the sea monster tide and is suspected of mastering advanced shipbuilding technology has officially stepped into the limelight. The island of Mayu pavilion became the focus of the entire sea overnight.</p>
<p>Countless gazes were cast from all directions, some with envy, some with fear, and even more with undisguised greed and malice. inside the island. However, the scene is quite different. Postwar reconstruction, treating the wounded, repairing defenses, and the final sprint to build the storm ship kept everyone incredibly busy. The commotion brought by public identity seemed to be kept out by an invisible barrier.</p>
<p>The pace on the island was tense yet orderly, even more efficient than before the war. Inside the central meeting tent, the core members gathered once again. Su Chians face was still pale, but she was able to stand up and sit back in a wooden chair covered with animal hides. Leewencio carefully tended to her. It&#x27;s in complete chaos outside.</p>
<p>She and Do rubbed his hands together, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of excitement and worry. My inbox is overflowing with messages from people trying to get information from us, seeking cooperation, wanting to defect, and even offering to buy information on the King of Storms at exorbitant prices. However, it&#x27;s unusually quiet on the Wings of Freedom side. It seems like Caesar has retreated to his lair and hasn&#x27;t made a move. He has licking his wounds and he has waiting for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Sure, how said in a deep voice, his bandage is still on. He suffered heavy losses in this battle and he has lost face badly. Knowing his personality, he will never give up. Next time he comes, he will be even more ruthless. We must hurry.</p>
<p>Da. All eyes were drawn to Lin Mo. Then involuntarily drifted to the massive structure outside the shed. Its hull already laid and the main mast and internal structure being installed. The streamlined hole reflected a matte deep brown sheen in the sunlight, and the scent of freshly applied waterproof paint mixed with resin filled the air.</p>
<p>The craftsmen, like ants, bustled about on and off the hall, their hammering, shouts, and sawing, creating a vibrant, hopeful cacophony. The main structure of the hall can be completed within 3 days. Leeway adjusted his glasses and quickly reported, &quot;The main mast and the four and a half mass bases can be fixed today. The sail and rigging system is the most time consuming. According to the simplified plan, it will take at least five more days to complete the initial construction.</p>
<p>The internal compartments, weapon platforms, and control systems can be improved later. But to reach a basic state that allows for safe navigation, it will take at least 7 days. 7 days. Lanimo tapped his fingers lightly on the table. The wings of freedom&#x27;s revenge could come at any moment.</p>
<p>The restless sea and the eye of the storm in the deeper reaches were beckoning. The deep sea unease that Su Chian had warned of had not completely subsided. Time was still of the essence. 3 days, Linimo said, his voice low, but quiet enough to silence the room. In 3 days, I want to see it able to go on the water and move with the help of sails and auxiliary paddles.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t te need to be perfect, but it must be able to move and fight. Dot. Leewi opened his mouth, wanting to say something. But seeing Lin Mo&#x27;s calm yet unwavering gaze, he swallowed his words and gritted his teeth, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll do our best. We need everyone&#x27;s manpower day and night.&quot; Okay, then Montac nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, how the defenses can&#x27;t be relaxed, but we can transfer some non-critical personnel to participate in the final stage of ship building, mainly for handling and assistance.&quot; Chen, do ensure the supply of all materials, especially food and energy potions. We can te let the craftsmen and brothers collapse from exhaustion. Understood, the two replied. Su Chanchian Lyno looked at the weak girl. You should rest well and recover your strength.</p>
<p>But there is one thing that only you can do. Dot. Go ahead, Such Chanchian said, raising her eyes. Use the heart of the ocean to bless or rather mark this ship, Linimo said slowly. I dantine need it to possess extraordinary power, but I hope it can be closer to the ocean, making it easier for you to perceive its state when needed and even providing some vague guidance in specific situations.</p>
<p>Doc Suchian was stunned, then fell into deep thought. After a long while, she said softly, &quot;I can try. I can try to weave my affinity and perception of the ocean into the parts of the ship that are in closest contact with the sea, such as the keel, the rudder, and the sea god with figurehead, a traditional blessing decoration. They&#x27;ll be installed soon. But this will take time, and I will need to recover most of my energy, and the effect cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>It may be negligible. Just your best. This is a symbol in itself.&quot; Lynn Emmo said, &quot;The launching ceremony will take place in 3 days, and we need your participation. With everything arranged, everyone dispersed.&quot; Lynn Emmo stepped out of the council chamber, the sea breeze brushing against his face. He walked along the newly built pier toward the gradually taking shape giant ship.</p>
<p>The craftsman stopped what they were doing when they saw him, casting a look of awe in their eyes. Lynn Emone nodded to them, signaling them to continue. He stroked the cool, smooth hull, feeling the unique resilience of the wood under his fingertips and the meticulously carved riveting marks. This was not merely a combination of wood and metal. It was the crystallization of the sweat, wisdom, and even blood of everyone in the Mo Yuan pavilion.</p>
<p>He climbed to the deck of the still under construction Stern Tower and looked down over the entire island. Fortifications stretched out in all directions. Watchtowers towered high and construction sheds dotted the landscape with people bustling about. A heavy sense of responsibility welled up within him. Secaster Shau&#x27;s voice came from behind and he walked up to stand beside Lyn Mo after the ship is built.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s the first step? Lynmo didn&#x27;t answer directly, but instead asked, what do you think? The wings of freedom must be dealt with or there will never be peace. Sure house said without hesitation, but attacking their stronghold directly is too risky. I suggest that we take advantage of our mobility to first eliminate their resource points and outposts on the periphery, cut off their claws, and force their main force to go out to sea for a decisive battle. At the same time, we should search for the entrance to the restless sea where there may be the highle materials we urgently need, and we can also verify Miss Sue&#x27;s senses, just like Lyno had thought. And there&#x27;s the stone masters brotherhood.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo added, &quot;They gave us maps and wooden cores, then went silent. I always felt that cube was key. We need more information about the truth of this world. They might know.&quot; The two men stared silently at the sea. In the distance, several small boats, clearly not belonging to the Moan Pavilion, lingered outside the cordon, seemingly spies from various factions who had come spy on them.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure how&#x27;s eyes turned cold. Should we send him away? No need, Linimo shook his head. Let them see. The clearer it is, the more some people will think twice. Deterrence is sometimes more effective than concealment.</p>
<p>Three days flew by under extreme pressure. The island was brightly lit almost day and night. Everyone was exhausted, but their eyes burned with a fire. The fire of witnessing the birth of a miraculous ship. Finally, at noon on the third day, all the main structures were installed.</p>
<p>Although many details were still incomplete and the interior was completely empty, the two masted sailing ship over 20 m long with its streamlined hull, towering main mast and menacing ram stood majestically in the expanded dock. Its hull was entirely dark brown except for the newly carved simple yet imposing wave and wind pattern totem on the bow which stood out vividly in the sunlight. The two characters, Emo Yuan, freshly painted on the stern, were powerful and imposing. On the riverbank, all members of the Muan Pavilion, whether or not they had participated in the construction, gathered. The craftsmen&#x27;s faces were covered in oil, but their eyes shown with an astonishing light.</p>
<p>The soldiers stood at attention, weapons at their sides. Non-combatants helped the wounded, craning their necks in anticipation. Even Su Chian supported by Lee Wio stood at the very front of the crowd. Linmo stood at the bow of the ship facing the crowd. The sea breeze billowed his robes making them flutter loudly.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, his voice transmitted clearly through the tin megaphone reached everyone&#x27;s ears. This ship has no name because its name will be written by every voyage we make, every victory we achieve. It is not merely wood and iron. is an arc forged from the will, sweat, and sacrifice of all of us. Today, it will embrace the ocean for the first time.</p>
<p>He paused, his gaze sweeping over each face, whether weary, excited, or expectant. I know that many people are still doubting, fearing, and watching. They doubt whether we can survive under the threat of the wings of freedom and countless sea monsters. They fear this world full of unknowns and dangers. They watch how far a little boat which has just set sail can go to.</p>
<p>But I stand here today only to tell you and to everyone watching us. Lynn Emmo slammed his hand heavily on the cold ship side. From this day forward, Emo Yuan Pavilion will fear no storm. This ship will be our sword and shield as we cleave through the waves. Our goal is not to survive, but to conquer.</p>
<p>To conquer this raging sea, to unveil the mysteries of this world and to carve out a place where we can truly stand for ourselves and for all those who are willing to follow us. Now he turned to face the sea, took a deep breath, and declared loudly. I hereby announce that the flagship of the Muan Pavilion is launched and set sail. Roar! Amidst deafening cheers, the ropes to the massive wooden sliding rails were simultaneously cut. The dot gates opened and seawater poured in.</p>
<p>Under the watchful eyes of hundreds of people, the dark brown behemoth emitted a deep ancient grinding sound as it slowly and steadily slid into the azure sea along the greasecoated slide. The waves splashed. The boat sank slightly, then rose steadily and swayed gently with the waves. It was a success. The crowd on the shore erupted in even louder cheers and applause, and many people were moved to tears.</p>
<p>Lynn, Emo, it did not linger. He turned around and nodded to Shao, A Wu, Shiao Chun, and the first batch of 10 selected sailors, including Xiao, Thai, and Lu Fong, who were already waiting at the ship&#x27;s side. Board, raise the sails, see trials begin. The sailors, well-trained, climbed the rope nets and took their positions. Sherh Howal personally took the helm.</p>
<p>On the main mast and fore mast, huge triangular sails made of high strength canvas were slowly raised, making a full rustling sound in the seab breeze. The auxiliary paddle wheel at the stern was also started by manpower to provide initial power. The dark brown sailboat, as if imbued with a soul, slowly began to leave the dock, gliding along the coastline of Moyuan Island and heading towards the vast open sea. The crowd on the shore chased and cheered, reluctant to disperse for a long time. As Su Chanchian watched the ship&#x27;s silhouette gradually shrink, feeling the extremely weak yet real connection established through the heart of the ocean.</p>
<p>A relieved smile appeared on her pale face. She and Dodu, meanwhile, had already begun to plan how to use this successful launching ceremony and the reputation of the king of storms to gain more benefits and development space for pavilion. On the distant sea, the spying ships hurriedly turned around, spreading the news that Mayuan Pavilion possesses a large sailing ship and has successfully launched it to all directions as quickly as possible. The king of storms has boarded the ship with his sword. The curtain of a new era is being slowly drawn back by this giant black sailed ship on a deep blue sea.</p>
<p>The sails receded into the distance, leaving only a straight white contrail, as if announcing the arrival of the conquerors to this boundless raging sea. Chapter 34, First Battle triumphs, new rules for the coast. The storm sailing ship&#x27;s first sea trial did not go far. Sherhow carefully maneuvered the giant ship, which he was not yet fully familiar with, and conducted various basic tests within a range of about 10 nautical miles from Muan Pavilion Island. steering flexibility, speed under different wind conditions, pressure resistance of the sail and rigging system, efficiency of the propeller auxiliary power, and overall stability of the hull.</p>
<p>The results were exhilarating, although the hollow interior resulted in a high center of gravity and slight tilting during sharp turns. The keel&#x27;s strength and the hull&#x27;s streamline design provided excellent resilience. With the main sail and jib working together, it could reach speeds of nearly 8 knots in moderate winds. And with manual propulsion, it could break 10 knots in shore bursts. This was an astonishing speed in an era when rowing and rudimentary sails were the norm.</p>
<p>Good boat. Sure, how gripped the helm tightly, feeling the steady and powerful feedback from the waves beneath his feet. A rare hint of admiration appeared on his usually stern face. It&#x27;s just that I still need to get used to the handling, especially the turning, which is much slower than a small raft. Lynmo stood at the bow, letting the sea breeze caress his face, his sharp gaze sweeping across the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>In his field of vision, besides a few curious seabirds following him, there were only a few small boats observing from a far spies from various factions, seemingly intimidated by the imposing presence of this massive black sailed ship, dared not approach. &quot;The testing is almost complete. Return a port,&quot; Lin Mo ordered. Let everyone familiarize themselves with the coordination between their respective positions on the ship. Starting tomorrow, we will conduct tactical drills.</p>
<p>The sailboat traced a graceful arc across the sea before turning back. Although the sailors were still somewhat clumsy, their training was beginning to show results. Raising and lowering the sails, adjusting the mooring lines, and relaying commands were gradually becoming more methodical. Just then, Shiao Chan, who was in charge of lookout, suddenly issued a warning from the main mass lookout basket right front about five nautical miles. Smoke and fire.</p>
<p>It looks like ships are fighting. Everyone immediately became alert. Lyn Mo raised his binoculars and looked. Sure enough, on the southeastern horizon, the outlines of several ships could be vaguely seen, intertwined, black smoke rising, and occasional flashes of light from explosions. The distance was too great to discern which force it belonged to, but it seemed to be quite large.</p>
<p>Shall we go take a look? Sure, how asked. Lin Mo pondered for a moment. A newly launched ship unaccustomed to combat, risked greatly by rashly engaging in unfamiliar battles. But this also presented an opportunity to test its combat capabilities, observe the movements of surrounding forces, and perhaps even move closer, maintain distance, and observe from outside the engagement zone, Linmo decided. Everyone, level one combat readiness.</p>
<p>Load the ballisti. Archers on deck. Do not fire without my order. Yes. The sailboat adjusted its course and quietly headed towards the battle zone.</p>
<p>As the distance closed, the battlefield situation gradually became clear. For ships are besieging one. The ship under attack is a medium-sized two-masted merchant vessel. Its hold damaged in several places, its sails ablaze, and it is desperately putting up a fight. The four attacking ships are of different styles, but all of them fly a black flag with crossbow knives and lightning bolts on their prow the wings of liberty.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re plundering merchant ships. The merchant ship was clearly no pushover either. Its deck was teeming with people, and arrows and spears were constantly being fired back. A couple of ballisti were even firing, repelling several small boats that attempted to board. But facing an attack from four ships, defeat was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the White Bird. Shi and Duo Duo had somehow climbed up to the bow of the ship, holding up another pair of binoculars. His expression changed. Captain Lao buys an honest man. He mainly runs short hall trade between SH 738 and 739.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s done business with us a few times and has a very good reputation. Those bastards from the wings of freedom. Lynmo&#x27;s eyes were icy cold. Caesar had just suffered a great loss at his hands. And now he was plundering neutral merchant ships to make up for his losses.</p>
<p>His methods as despicable as ever. Master, shall we fight? Shirha asked in a deep voice, his hand already gripping the helm. On the deck, A Wu Xiao Tai and the others also gripped their weapons tightly, their eyes burning with determination. On their first test to the new ship, they yearned for a real victory to prove themselves. Lynmo didn&#x27;t answer immediately.</p>
<p>He was calculating. The enemy had four ships. Two were similar warships to those he had seen before, and two were converted speedboats. Beside only had one new ship with fewer than 20 sailors. Although the ship was strong and the cannons powerful, relatively speaking, they were at a disadvantage in terms of numbers and experience.</p>
<p>Charging indirectly for a head-on battle would be unwise. His gaze swept across the battlefield, then looked at the quiet yet dangerous black sailboat beneath his feet, and a thought flashed through his mind. No boarding action. Lynn Emmo quickly ordered. Sure.</p>
<p>Howal, seize the windward position and maintain distance. Ballist, aim at those two speedboats. Prioritize damaging their engines and sails. Archers, use free fire to disrupt the enemy ship&#x27;s decks. Chi and Dodu, use flag signals and megaphones to call out White Bird, telling them to move closer to us.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll cover their retreat. The order was clearly given. Shirhow immediately took the helm and the sailboat taking advantage of the wind drew a swift arc seizing the upwind position on the battlefield while maintaining a distance of about 150 m from the freedom wings ships just within the effective range of the heavy ballisti and beyond the threat range of most of the enemy&#x27;s arrows pavilion is here wings of freedom cease your attack immediately or you will be considered to have declared war on us and do picked up a tin megaphone and ruled with all his might while simultaneously having a sailor who knew Semaphore send out a simple signal. The sudden appearance of the massive black sailed warship and its shouts brought the battlefield to a standstill. The wings of freedom clearly recognized this newly renowned vessel, their offensive noticeably slowing.</p>
<p>The four ships began to adjust their formation, wearily facing the direction of the Inc. Abyss Pavilion. Meanwhile, the heavily damaged White Bird, as if grasping at a straw, desperately steered towards Linn Mos direction. It&#x27;s the Moyuan Pavilion, the Storm King&#x27;s ship, came a joyful shout from the White Bird. Who cares about any king? There&#x27;s only one ship.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s there to be afraid of? Let&#x27;s rob them all. On one of the wings of Freedom&#x27;s warships, a leader-like man grinned and ordered, &quot;Send one warship and one speedboat to block that merchant ship. The other two follow me and take down this charlatan. Two ships, a warship and a speedboat, broke away from the encirclement and approached the black sailing ship. The other two ships intensified their attack on the white bird.</p>
<p>Greed nose. Then Emmo sneered. Crossbows, aim at that speedboat, fire. The two heavy ballisti, already calibrated, roared with a deep resonant sound. The armthick musketss tore through the air with a piercing shriek, hurtling straight at the fast enemy ship that was attempting to outflank them.</p>
<p>The wings of Liberty&#x27;s fast boat had a relatively thin hull designed for speed. One crossbow bolt grazed the hull, kicking up a cloud of wood chips. The other, however, struck squarely in the mid stern of the hull. Could boom. Wood chips flew everywhere.</p>
<p>A large hole was torn in the hull of the speedboat. Seaater rushed in. The speed dropped sharply. The hull began to tilt and chaos ensued on board. With just one salvo, they destroyed one of the enemy&#x27;s mobile forces.</p>
<p>The leader of the wings of freedom on the charging warship gasped in shock. He hadn&#x27;t expected the enemy&#x27;s ballisti to be so powerful and accurate, but he was already prepared, so he had no choice but to bite the bullet and order his archers to fire while simultaneously trying to get closer to the ship side. However, the black sailing ship, which had the upwind position, was faster and more agile. Sure, how steered steadily, maintaining a perfect distance from the enemy ship at all times. The archers on deck under the cover of shields continuously hurled arrows at the enemy ship.</p>
<p>Although their accuracy was mediocre due to the distance and the wind and waves, they effectively disrupted the enemy&#x27;s deck crew. Lyno did not use Ballisti to attack the warship, but instead ordered, &quot;Aim at the other warship, besieging the White Bird and break its mast.&quot; The Ballistic crew quickly adjusted their angle. At that moment, the White Bird was desperately trying to break free from the entanglement and was quite close to the warship at a tricky angle. Put another precise volley. One crossbow bolt missed its target, but the other, as if guided by its own eyes, slammed into the lower part of the warship&#x27;s main mast.</p>
<p>could boom. The heavy hardwood mast groaned under the strain and snapped in two, crashing down on the deck along with the sail ropes. The warship instantly lost its main power and spun sideways on a sea, unable not only to continue pursuing the white bird, but also blocking its companions attack route. In the blink of an eye, of the four ships of Wings of Freedom, one was severely damaged, one was paralyzed, and only two remained intact, one of which was temporarily held up by the White Bird. The battlefield situation reversed in an instant.</p>
<p>The captain of the warship that had originally charged toward the black sailing ship was terrified when he saw that his side had lost more than half of its fighting force in an instant, while the strange black sailing ship was unharmed and still moving nimly. Retreat. Retreat now. He roared horarssely, no longer caring about saving face, and turned the boat around to run away. Try to run.</p>
<p>Lyn Mos eyes turned cold. Chase after them. Keep your distance and send them off with arrows and crossbows. Sure, how don&#x27;t let them get away easily. The black sailing ship, like a persistent leech, used its speed advantage to linger at a distance behind the fleeing warship.</p>
<p>Its ballisty occasionally booming and its arrows constantly harassing it. Although it failed to sink the warship, it had left it in a sorry state with men constantly falling into the water from arrow wounds, its sails pierced in several places, and its speed gradually decreasing. Finally, after leaving behind more than a dozen corpses and a ship full of wounds, the warship barely managed to shake off its pursuers and rendevu with another equally battered warship that had also managed to escape the clutches of a white bird before fleeing in a panic to the southeast. The crippled warship and the heavily damaged fast ship were mercilessly abandoned on the sea. Their crews jumping overboard and desperately swimming away.</p>
<p>Linmo did not order a complete annihilation. One should not pursue a desperate enemy. The situation at sea is complex and he needed to preserve his strength and also leave behind some propaganda materials. The battle ended and the sea returned to calm, leaving only burning wreckage, floating debris, and the wailing of those who had fallen into the water. The white bird slowly approached, and Captain Lao by a middle-aged man with a weathered face and injured arm, stood at the damaged bow and bowed deeply to the black sailboat.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you so much, Pavilion Master Lynn, for saving my life. I will never forget it, Captain B. There&#x27;s no need for such formalities.&quot; Lynn Emmo stood at the ship&#x27;s railing. With the wings of freedom rampaging, it&#x27;s our duty to stand guard and help each other. How is your ship damaged? Are there any casualties? Seven brothers died and more than a dozen were injured.</p>
<p>The ship can still move with difficulty, but it needs major repairs. Bi&#x27;s voice was filled with grief and relief. If it weren&#x27;t for Pavilion Master Lynn&#x27;s timely arrival, my entire crew would probably have perished here today. Come back to Muan Pavilion with me to rest first. Lynn and Mo invited.</p>
<p>Also, Captain B, may I speak with you in private? I want to talk to you and all my friends who are still struggling to survive about what happened today and the rules of this sea area from now on. Old B was taken aback, then seemed to understand something and nodded solemnly. I dare not disobey. The black sailboat led the battered white bird back towards Moyuan Island. News of this battle spread faster than the wind throughout SH 739 and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Linmo, the king of storms, piloted the newly launched black sailed giant ship on his first voyage, single-handedly defeating the four ship raiding squadron of Wings of Freedom and rescuing the White Bird with almost no damage to himself. Wings of Liberty suffered another crushing defeat. Their ferocity thwarted. What people care about even more is what Lyno said to Captain B at the end about the rules of the sea area. All the forces, teams, and lone wolves who heard the news understood that this sea, which was originally dominated by chaos and power, was about to welcome a new ruler who was trying to establish order.</p>
<p>Although he only had one ship and his territory was just an island, but the power, skill, and unwavering yet undeniable presence he displayed have prompted many to begin to seriously consider. Will they continue to struggle in the fear and chaos of the wings of liberty? Or will they turn to the perhaps more orderly future envisioned by the newly crowned King of the Storm? On the sea, black sails flutter, cutting through the waves, resolutely heading towards home. What it carries is not just a ship full of people and victory, but also the prototype of a new era and a set of new maritime regulations that will soon be forcibly implemented. Chapter 35. New rules establish authority.</p>
<p>Order takes shape. When a white bird followed the giant black sailed ship into the makeshift dock on Muan Pavilion Island, Captain Lao by and his still shaken crew were stunned by the site before them. They had expected to see a dilapidated, barely surviving post-war camp, but instead they were greeted by a wellorganized, heavily fortified sea fortress. Tall, thick breast works snaked along the island. Flags flew brightly at top wooden and stone watchtowers.</p>
<p>Craftsmen were repairing fortifications. Soldiers were patrolling and training. And in the distance, in a newly built dock, the skeletons of several smaller vessels were even being erected. The entire island exuded an air of efficiency and vitality. A stark contrast to the chaos and despair circulated outside.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Mo Yuan pavilion.&quot; A young sailor behind Lao by murmured, his eyes filled with disbelief. &quot;Captain by please.&quot; Linmo had already disembarked and was waiting at the dock. He had changed out of his battle attire and was now wearing a simple dark cloth robe. His expression was calm without the arrogance of someone who had just fought a great battle. Instead, he appeared even more composed.</p>
<p>Old by hurly led his men off the ship and bowed respectfully once again, &quot;Sect Master Lynn. We are sorry to have bothered you. Your place has truly broadened my horizons. It&#x27;s just a struggle for survival.&quot; Lin Mo led them to a relatively intact shack area. Your crew could be temporarily housed here.</p>
<p>Such Chanchi and our doctor will bring people over to treat the wounded. Food and water will be delivered soon, so please rest first. The thoughtful arrangements move the crew of the white bird to tears of gratitude. Soon, steaming hot fish soup and baked flatbread were brought over and sued Shian, although she herself had not fully recovered. Also came with Lewincentio and several people who knew a little about herbal medicine to clean and bandage the wounded.</p>
<p>All of this made these people who had just experienced a life or death ordeal feel a longlost sense of security and warmth. After settling in briefly, Lynn and Mo met with Lao by privately in the central meeting hall. She and Duo Duo and Sherhow were also present. The shed was simply furnished with only a rough wooden table and a few stools. Linmo poured Lao by a cup of hot water and got straight to the point.</p>
<p>Captain Bai, I save you out of sense of duty, so don&#x27;t worry about it. I invited you here today to talk about business at sea. Old by held the warm water cup in both hands and said with a rice smile, &quot;Sect leader Lynn, in this world, what legitimate business is there anymore? It&#x27;s nothing more than risking your life to rumage through various survivor outposts for supplies to earn a living. And you have to be constantly on guard against hungry wolves like the wings of freedom, just like today. What if I told you that this situation could be changed? Lyn Mo looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>Ola was taken aback. Change? How can be changed? Unless someone can suppress the wings of freedom and make this sea behave properly. After he finished speaking, he himself felt that it was unlikely. The wings of freedom were powerful and Caesar was even more notorious. Rules are made by people.</p>
<p>Lynmo&#x27;s tone was calm yet carried an undeniable power. The rules of wings of freedom are the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak and plunder for survival. My rules are fair trade and win-win order. He gestured to Chandu Duo. Chandu Duo immediately took out a simple clause written on a waterproof animal hide and pushed it in front of Loi.</p>
<p>The temporary general rules for the Mo Yuan C draft. Olai read the title aloud, his heart inexplicably beating a little faster. The provisions are very simple with only a few core points. I within the sphere of influence of the Mayuan pavilion tenatively SH 739 and some surrounding waters. The safety of navigation and transactions of all vessels that abide by the rules will be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Two unprovoked attacks and plundering of other ships are prohibited except for legitimate self-defense and hostile forces as announced. Third, Muan Pavilion establishes an arbitration office to accept and mediate maritime disputes subject to the voluntary participation of both parties. Four, Muan Pavilion provides paid escort, birth maintenance, and basic material supply services. Five, all shelter vessels are obligated to share non-core information on sea conditions, weather, and danger zones. At the end of the article, there is a line of small print.</p>
<p>During the trial period, Muan Pavilion reserves the right of final interpretation and the right to use force to uphold the rules. Old by read it over and over again, his breathing growing heavier. These few points, seemingly simple, directly addressed the biggest pain point for these small and medium-sized merchant ships and team safety. If it could be truly realized, even partially, it would mean they wouldn&#x27;t have to live in constant fear and could focus more on trade and production. Smaster Lynn, is this is this really possible? Old Bay&#x27;s voice trembled.</p>
<p>The wings of freedom will not stand idly by and there are other large and small plundering groups as well. Therefore, this requires the joint efforts of everyone who does not want to be plundered. Linmo said Mo Yuan Pavilion will be the framework of this umbrella, but it needs more ships like the White Bird to support this sky together. We do not ask you to pay tribute, nor do we force you to join. We only ask that while enjoying the protection, you abide by the rules and within your capabilities, share resources and help each other.</p>
<p>This is an open strategy. They&#x27;re trading security and order for people&#x27;s hearts, intelligence, and potential business networks. By remained silent for a long time, he had been naive at sea for many years. Lynmo&#x27;s ambitions were vast, and the risks were immense. But the reality was that without the Mo Yuan pavilion, his white bird would have sunk today and his men would be dead.</p>
<p>Following the bandit logic of wings of freedom would ultimately lead to either being swallowed up or destroyed. The path Linmo offered at least seemed to offer hope. I need time to consider this and I also need to discuss it with the brothers on board. Old finally said, his tone much more reassuring. But in any case, I by and everyone on the White Bird will forever remember the lifesaving grace of Pavilion Master Lynn today.</p>
<p>If there is any need for us as long as it doesn&#x27;t go against our conscience, we will certainly not refuse. That&#x27;s enough. Then Montac nuted. You guys stay here to repair the ship and recover from your injuries. Think it over carefully.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo will be in charge of coordinating supplies and repairs with you. After seeing off the emotionally turbulent Lao by Shin Duo Duo immediately stepped forward, his small eyes shining. SE leader brilliant. This general rule is tantamount to recruiting all small and medium-siz forces. As long as we demonstrate the strength to stop the wings of freedom.</p>
<p>We won&#x27;t have to worry about people coming to join us. At that time, information, resources, and manpower will all converge on us. The premise is that we can hold them off. sure how said in a deep voice, pouring cold water on the situation. Caesar has suffered such a huge loss, he won&#x27;t let it go easily.</p>
<p>Next time, there will probably be more than just a few raiding ships. Although our ship is powerful, we only have one, and we have few people. We are more than enough for defense, but far from enough to launch an offensive and control a large area of the sea. I know that Lynamo walked to the edge of the shed, looking at the bustling island outside. So we need allies and we need time.</p>
<p>Shien do Yuri in charge of releasing the contents of today battle and the general rules in an appropriate way. Emphasize our victory over the wings of freedom and our protection of merchant ships for those wavering oppressed small groups. You can secretly contact them and offer them some appropriate assistance. Understood. Public opinion warfare is also part of business warfare.</p>
<p>Shen Duo Duo accepted the order. Sure. How Linamo turned to him while strengthening the defenses. Select a second batch of sailors from the reserves and craftsmen to begin shipboard training. Also investigate whether we can use existing materials and captured freedom wing ships to quickly convert several fast sentry ships or auxiliary warships into vessels that can cooperate with the main warships.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t need to be very powerful, just capable of reconnaissance, harassment, and transportation. Converting captured ships will take time, but it&#x27;s highly feasible. I&#x27;ll get on it immediately. Sure, how agreed. Also, Lynn Mo concluded, &quot;Contact Dragon Soul Steel Gun.</p>
<p>Send them a copy of our established general rules, stating our position and intentions and seeking their opinions and possible cooperation. At the same time, inquire about the latest gathering movements of the Wings of Liberty and whether there is any new information regarding the Stonemason Brotherhood.&quot; The three men each accepted their orders and departed. Lynn Mo remained alone in the council chamber, his fingers unconsciously tapping on the table. Implementing new regulations and consolidating resources were on the agenda sooner than he had anticipated. But the opportunity was fleeting, and with the prestige of defeating the wings of freedom and rescuing the white bird at its peak, he had to raise the banner as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s revenge is a sword hanging over our heads. We must we have a net strong enough before he swings it down again. But deeper still, the long-standing mysteries and threats, the call of the restless sea, the secret of the sleeping forest, the silence of the Stonemason Brotherhood, and the deep sea tremors that Sue Chanchian sense cannot be ignored. He stepped out of the shed, the setting sun painting the sea a golden red hue. Beside the dock, the massive blacksailed warship lay silently anchored like a lurking beast.</p>
<p>Further away, the crew of the White Bird, with the help of members of the Ink Abyss Pavilion, were moving materials and repairing the hall. Faintly, he could hear conversations and occasional laughter. The relief of surviving a catastrophe, and perhaps a glimmer of hope for the future. The seeds of order have been sewn. Whether it can spread like wildfire depends on what happens next.</p>
<p>Whether the storm of the wings of freedom arrives first, or whether Linn Mo&#x27;s rules take root in this cruel sea first. He turned and walked toward the shipyard. There, under Shure House&#x27;s direction, the craftsmen were busily dismantling and modifying the captured wings of freedom ships. Time waits for no one. He had to play each card in his hand in the most appropriate position as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Chapter 36, general rules take effect. Clashes in the underground market. The temporary general rules for the MOUNC area has generated a far greater response in SH739 and the surrounding waters than expected. Much like a drop of boiling oil being thrown into water, Chindwood was public opinion offensive was remarkably effective. He not only disseminated the full text of the general rules through several semi-public intelligence channels, but also carefully leaked the detailed account of the black sailboat of the Moyuan Pavilion&#x27;s first victory and the rescue of the White Bird with appropriate artistic embellishment along with real life images of the White Bird&#x27;s crew receiving treatment on the island and the ship being repaired.</p>
<p>Synthesized using simple sketches and fragments of crystal photo recording stones in no time. Topics such as storm king Lynn Mo wants to establish new rules at sea. Wings of freedom raiding team suffers thunderous blow and moan pavilion provides safe trading zone spread wildly in the regional channels and private exchanges of various small gathering places. The reactions varied. Some small groups and lone merchant ships who had long been oppressed by the wings of freedom or other plundering gangs sought a ray of light in the long night.</p>
<p>Although they dared not openly express their support, in private, some ships began to carefully bypass the traditional dangerous routes and attempt to conduct probing activities within the claimed range of 30 nautical miles around Muan Pavilion Island. Other medium-sized groups, though slightly stronger, but also struggling with chaos, adopted a cautious wait andsee attitude. They admired the strength and sense of order that Lin Mo had demonstrated, but also worried whether this was the prelude to the rise of another wings of freedom, or whether the Mo Yuon pavilion was capable of withstanding Caesar&#x27;s inevitable and furious counterattack. More often, however, are those who lurk in the shadows, spying and scheming. The remnants of the Wings of Liberty, raiding groups from other regions, and even some independent strong men with complex backgrounds are all watching coldly, assessing the true worth of this newly crowned king of storms and calculating the possibility of profiting from him.</p>
<p>Lyno was fully aware of this. He didn&#x27;t expect a single set of rules to make everyone bowed down in submission. This was merely a signal, a filter to initially separate those forces that yearned for order and were willing to cooperate from the quagmire of chaos. A few days later, the first batch of visitors came to the door on their own initiative. It wasn&#x27;t a fleet of ships, but three unassuming small fishing rafts carrying seven or eight thin salow-faced men and women with shrewd eyes.</p>
<p>They claimed to be from a small mutual aid group called the Scavengers Union, which made a living by collecting remnants and supplies from abandoned islands and shallow sea ruins, and was frequently driven away and exploited by various forces. &quot;Master Lynn,&quot; said an elderly woman with gray hair and large knuckles, who introduced herself as Grandma Luo, &quot;We have heard of your general rules. We dare not ask for protection, but only for a relatively safe place on the edge of the sea area. You have designated to organize our harvest, repair our tools, and occasionally exchange the scraps we find for some decent food and medicine. We are willing to hand over a portion of our earnings as birthing fees as per the rules.</p>
<p>And we are also willing to share some of the less valuable bits of information we know. Dot. He was very pragmatic and humble. This perfectly suited Lynn Mo&#x27;s current needs. He needed fresh input, information, and proof that his rules could indeed bring tangible benefits.</p>
<p>All right, Lynn Mo personally received them. Three nautical miles east of Mo Yuan Pavilion. There&#x27;s a group of reefs that protrude from the water. You can temporarily stop there. For transactions, you can contact Steward Shien Duo Duo.</p>
<p>Remember, follow the rules and don&#x27;t cause trouble. This is your safe haven. Grandma Luo thanked them profusely and left with her people. Soon, wisps of smoke rose from the rocky area, jokingly called scavengers corner, adding a touch of life. Chando Duo also sifted through their scattered bits of information and gleaned a few useful details.</p>
<p>For example, there was a large piece of metal resembling a shipwreck under a reef in the southeast. Strangely shaped, large, unfamiliar ships have been frequently appearing in the vicinity of the restless sea, and the wings of freedom seemed to be secretly acquiring large quantities of sulfur and some kind of heatresistant clay. Almost simultaneously, Dragon&#x27;s soul steel guns reply arrived. The reply was lengthy, cautious, yet proactive. Dragon Soul acknowledges Lin Mo&#x27;s efforts to establish order, considering it a necessary attempt to counter the chaotic laws of wings of freedom.</p>
<p>They are willing to cooperate on intelligence sharing and limited resource exchange, especially food and medicine, and promise to provide a certain degree of strategic deterrence when necessary and feasible. However, they explicitly state that they will not directly intervene in the armed conflict between Moan Pavilion and Wings of Freedom unless the situation escalates to the point of threatening the survival of all Dragon Kingdom survivors in the region. Dragon Soul doesn&#x27;t have much information about the Stonemason Brotherhood, only that their recent activities have become more secretive, seemingly focusing their efforts on exploring a specific deep sea steel forest ruin, possibly related to deciphering some ancient script or technology. Regarding the Wings of Freedom, Dragon Souls intelligence confirmed part of Lu Po&#x27;s report. After returning to his lair, Caesar was both frantically punishing his underlings for poor performance and nearly emptying his coffers, using multiple agents to ruthlessly acquire sulfur, salt peter, oil, and large quantities of timber for arow shafts and ship planks throughout the region.</p>
<p>He seemed to be preparing some kind of large-scale highintensity attack with the target most likely being the Moan Pavilion. Sulfur, salt, peter, kerosene. He&#x27;s planning a fire attack. sure how frowned as he looked at the intelligence report. Or maybe he&#x27;s making explosives.</p>
<p>Our ships and fortifications are mostly made of wood, which is extremely vulnerable to fire. Caesar learned his lesson last time and knows he wanted to gain anything from a direct confrontation. So he as looking for other methods that Len Mo pondered is acquiring timber intended to replenish the losses from the warships. Or is there another motive? Suchan who had been listening quietly suddenly spoke up. Her voice was still weak, but her thoughts were clear.</p>
<p>Heart of the ocean is very sensitive to large-scale energy accumulation. If Caesar wants to use a large amount of explosives or inciniary agents, the preparation process cannot completely conceal the energy fluctuations. I could try to concentrate my mind and use directional sensing in the direction of the wings of Freedom&#x27;s layer, which may provide an early warning. That&#x27;s too risky. Leeway immediately objected.</p>
<p>You haven&#x27;t recovered yet, and your directional sensing will consume even more energy. Plus, it&#x27;ll easily attract the attention of any potential sensory beings in the enemy camp. It is worth a try, Sue Chenhan insisted. It has better to be proactive in issuing warnings than to be passively attacked. I only need to know if there&#x27;s a large-scale accumulation of dangerous energy.</p>
<p>I Dante needs specific details. Looking at Sue Shian&#x27;s pale face and determined eyes, Lynn Emmo finally nodded. We can try, but we must control the time and intensity. Stop immediately if you feel unwell. Leeway, you cooperate with her and prepare some calming and energy boosting medicine.</p>
<p>Unerstood lelia allesi. Just as everyone was discussing countermeasures, she duo duo hurdly walked in, his face bearing a strange expression that was a mixture of excitement and seriousness. Master, there is a a big deal, but it has a bit of a hot potato. Do he lowered his voice and middleman has connected us with a mysterious seller who has a shipment he wants to sell. The quantity is large, including at least 500 caddies of refined sulfur, 200 caddies of purified salt peter, 30 barrels of high purity kerosene, and 50 pieces of treated hemlock wood, which is the best material for masts.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a chill run down their spines. Sulfur, salt, peter, kerosene, and top quality timber. Wasn&#x27;t this exactly what Caesar was frantically buying up? Who is the seller? What do you want to exchange? Lenmo asked. The seller is extremely mysterious, communicating only through encrypted messages, and their identity is unknown. They&#x27;re asking for a high price, not ordinary supplies, and specifically request three things in exchange.</p>
<p>First, the complete version of the bronze fence craftsmanship that we auctioned before. Second, a detailed report on the distribution of energy nodes inside Sleeping Forest Abyss, even if it&#x27;s just speculation. Third, she and Duodu paused a one-year safe passage guarantee personally signed by Storm King. Lyn and Mo covering the SH 700 to750 area. What huge appetite? Not only do they want the technology and key intelligence, but they also want Lin Mo&#x27;s reputation as a guarantee.</p>
<p>Is this extortion or a test? Sure, how sneered. Perhaps both. Lynn Emmo tapped his fingers lightly on the table. The only reason someone can produce so many of Caesar s most urgently needed supplies at once is either because of a powerful and wellestablished force or because there are problems within the wings of freedom and someone wants to use us to trip up Caesar while also reaping benefits. Should we accept it or not? Shin Duo asked.</p>
<p>Accepting it might get us involved in an unknown conspiracy and there&#x27;s also the risk of technology leaks. He glanced at Lynn Emmo. The bronze armor plate technology wasn&#x27;t core, but it was still an important asset except that Lynmo said almost without hesitation, but the conditions need to be changed. The bronze process can be simplified, removing the core alloy ratios and quenching steps. The report on sleeping linuan can provide a fuzzy analysis of the outer energy field, but no information about the core area.</p>
<p>As for the guarantee of safe passage, a cold glint flashed in his eyes, it only guarantees the safety of the sea areas directly controlled by the Mo Yuan pavilion and the three designated public shipping routes with the additional clause. If the guarantee party actively attacks the Mo Yuan pavilion or its allies, the guarantee will be immediately voided and the party will be considered hostile. In addition, Lynn Mo added, &quot;We will decide the transaction location. The sooner the better. Tell the middleman that we also need to inspect the goods.</p>
<p>Also try to investigate the middlemanes background and the possible origin of these goods. This is a dance on a knife&#x27;s edge using noncore technology and vague intelligence to acquire strategic resources that could severely damage Caesar while simultaneously testing the waters of hidden adversaries or allies. Risk and opportunity coexist. Chi and Duo Duo accepted the order and quickly went to carry it out. Over the next two days, beneath the surface of calm, turbulent undercurrents surged on Mayuen Pavilion Island.</p>
<p>Several similar small groups gradually arrived at the scavenging corner and the rocky area had essentially formed a miniature neutral market protected by the rules of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. Although the transaction volume was not large, information began to converge. Under careful conditioning, Su Chian conducted two short-term directional sensing tests. The feedback was vague but alarming. In the direction of the wings of Freedom&#x27;s layer, multiple unstable and malicious energy aggregation points were indeed detected.</p>
<p>Although the intensities varied, they were widely distributed and did not appear to be naturally formed. Lewi&#x27;s led craftsmen and some sailors working day and night and successfully converted two light sentry boats using captured ships and existing materials. The boats were long and narrow, equipped with small sails and spare ores, and were quite fast. Although they had little offensive capability, they were sufficient for reconnaissance, communication, and harassing small enemy ships. Meanwhile, Chi and Duo Duo, after some tense remote bargaining, and covert investigation, finally reached a preliminary agreement with the mysterious seller.</p>
<p>The transaction location was set near a notorious abandoned island situated between the territories of Mayuin Pavilion in the Wings of Freedom. The time was midnight tomorrow night. As night fell, Lyno stood on the bow of the black sailboat, gazing at the dark sea in the distance. Tomorrow night&#x27;s trading may be a trap, or it may be a turning point. The energy gathering that Sue Chanchian sensed, Caesar&#x27;s frantic purchasing, and the sudden appearance of the mysterious seller, these clues, like scattered puzzle pieces, seemed to point to a storm.</p>
<p>And can his ship, his rules, his naent order, stand firm in the coming storm, or even rise with the wind? He gripped the gunnel tightly. The icy touch made his mind exceptionally clear. Whatever comes his way, he has to accept it. From a moment he decided to stand up and try to establish new rules for this sea of blood and fire. There was no turning back.</p>
<p>Only by moving forward and crushing all obstacles can we pave a path for those who come after us. Chapter 37. The mystery of the night flight. The mentor appears. At midnight.</p>
<p>The sea was pitch black with only a few faint starlight piercing through the low-hanging clouds. The black sailed warship Emoi Yuan moved like a silent ghost, turning off all its lights. Relying solely on Sue Chanchian&#x27;s heart of the ocean for a keen sense of the ocean currents and sure how skillful steering, it glided under the cover of darkness toward the agreed upon no man&#x27;s land abandoned island. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Apart from the necessary sailors and Lin Mo and Shure How by the helm, only a Woo, Shiao Chan, and five other elite warriors remained on deck, all clad in dark armor, their weapons within easy reach.</p>
<p>Su Xian stayed in the cabin, her face still pale, but she insisted on going along, her senses were the only reliable eyes in this environment. Weary still three nautical miles from the target island. Dot sure how s voice was low almost a whisper there s no energy reaction from large ships around but there s something underwater very faint like it s lurking suchan closed her eyes and concentrated for a moment then nodded gently it&#x27;s not a large sea beast it looks like a man-made sensor or a small diving device characteristics are unfamiliar Lynmo&#x27;s eyes narrowed slightly other side had indeed prepared a backup plan the outline sign of the abandoned island gradually emerged from the darkness like the remains of a colossal beast lying prone on the sea. The agreed upon meeting place was a sheltered shallow bay on the north side of the island. From afar, the bay was quiet with only the monotonous sound of waves gently lapping against the rocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow down, maintain distance, and send out scout boats to scout ahead,&quot; Lin Mo ordered. A light patrol boat was lowered and led by Shiao Shun and two experienced sailors. It glided silently into the shallow bay like a water strider. Moments later, rhythmic faint bird calls echoed in the darkness safety signal. The black sailed ship then slowly approached the edge of a shallow bay and anchored about 100 meters from shore.</p>
<p>At this distance, the ballisti could cover most of the bay entrance and retreat would be relatively easy. almost simultaneously with the anchor being lowered, a lone lantern covered by a thick cloth lit up in the shadow of a reef on the inner side of the bay. Its dim yellowish light illuminated only a few meters around. Beneath the lantern, three figures draped in gray cloaks stood indistinctly, their forms obscured by the large fabric. Beside them lay several square objects covered with oil cloth, presumably the goods for the trade.</p>
<p>The other party was indeed punctual and there weren&#x27;t many people there. Chin duo duo take some in to inspect the goods. Sure, how keep watch around. A woo, take two men and come down with me. Lynn Emmo quickly gave the orders.</p>
<p>He put on light leather armor, slung the modified crossbow over his back, and hung a short knife at his waist. He was the first to descend a rope net to a small boat. Chin Duo Duo followed closely behind with two knowledgeable craftsmen. The small boat cut through the calm water, heading towards the lone light. As they drew closer, Linmo could see the three greyrobeed figures.</p>
<p>They all wore masks that covered half of their faces, revealing only their emotionless eyes. The one in the middle was of medium build, his hands tucked into his sleeves, his demeanor as calm as a stone. Pavilion Master Lynn, it&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you. The man in the middle spoke, his voice deliberately processed, carrying a metallic quality indistinguishable from a males or females. The goods are here.</p>
<p>What are our terms? Lynn Emmo stepped onto the damp rocks, his gaze sweeping over the oil cloth packages. Once the goods have been inspected, the payment will be made. He gestured to Chandu Duo. Chiand Doduo and the craftsman stepped forward and carefully lifted part of the oil cloth to check the color of the sulfur, the purity of the salt peter, and the viscosity of the kerosene. They also tapped the wood to test its hardness and grain.</p>
<p>After a moment, Chin Duodo gave Linmo a barely perceptible nod. The goods were genuine, of excellent quality, and the quantity was basically correct. The technical data and intelligence reports are here. Linmo took out two sealed bamboo tubes from his pocket and placed them on a flat rock. A simplified version of the bronze armor process, removing the three core steps, but the basic framework and principles are complete.</p>
<p>Records and preliminary inferences about the energy field fluctuations around Sleeping Forest Abyss. The core area is not involved. The greyroged leader glanced at the bamboo tube, but didn&#x27;t immediately take it. Instead, he slowly said, &quot;Then what about the guarantee?&quot; Lynn Mo took out the third item, a speciallymade token made of a thin metal sheet etched with the characters Mo Yuan and simple wave patterns. On the back was Lin Mo&#x27;s personal mark, which was difficult to imitate, left with a special engraving knife and a line of small characters.</p>
<p>The holder of this token shall enjoy temporary safe passage within the three shipping routes under the jurisdiction of MOU on attached and the controlled area for a period of one year. Note if the holder attacks me or my alliance, this token shall be invalidated and the holder shall be regarded as an enemy. You place the token on the rock as well. The token is here and the additional terms are written. Now it&#x27;s your turn.</p>
<p>The gray-roed leader remained silent for a few seconds, seemingly assessing the situation. Finally, he slightly raised his hand, signaling his companions to push the goods towards Linmo. At the same time, he stepped forward and reached for the three items. The deal appears to be nearing completion. Just as the gray robe leader&#x27;s finger was about to touch the bamboo tube, a sudden change occurred.</p>
<p>Whoosh! Boom! A burning rocket shot out from nowhere, streaking across the dark night sky and striking precisely a pile of abandoned ship planks not far to the side of the group. Flames instantly rose up, illuminating half of the shallow bay. Almost simultaneously, several splashes of water erupted from beneath the surface at the entrance to the shallow bay. Four small shuttle-shaped and entirely black submarines, each operated by single pilot, broke through the water. Their bows gleamed with a cold light.</p>
<p>There were specially designed rams and underwater crossbow firing ports. Further away, in the shadows high on the abandoned island, several points of fire flashed, and the sound of bow strings vibrating and short spears piercing the air tore through the silence of a night. An ambush and not just on one side. Enemy attack. Protect the pavilion.</p>
<p>Master Sherhow&#x27;s furious roar came from the black sail ship. The ballisti on the Mo Yuan roared, firing at the several black submarines that had suddenly appeared and the fires high above on the shallow bay reef. Lin Mo reacted extremely quickly, crouching low the moment the rocket exploded and shouted sharply, &quot;Retreat back to the ship.&quot; Chi and Duo Duo and the craftsmen scrambled to push the heavy packages. A Woo and two warriors quickly raised their shields, standing in front of Linmo and deflecting several arrows that flew through the air. The three gray robe men seemed takenback, but they didn&#x27;t panic.</p>
<p>The leader quickly grabbed the bamboo tube and token left by Linmo and put them in his pocket, while the other two swiftly dragged two rectangular metal boxes from beside the pile of goods and open them with lightning speed. Inside were two exquisitly crafted folding crossbows that gleamed with a ghostly blue light. &quot;They&#x27;re not ours,&quot; the gray robroed leader growled at Linmo, his voice no longer feigned, but a slightly horse male voice. Its water ghost and night owl from the wings of freedom. Caesar&#x27;s assassination squad.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he raised his crossbow and fired a barrage of shots at the nearest black submarine charging towards them. The crossbow bolts were incredibly fast, their arrow heads leaving eerie blue after images in the darkness, accurately striking a spot on the side of the submarine. The submarine&#x27;s speed was momentarily halted, and it began to leak water. Wings of Liberty, how did Caesar know about this deal? And why did he send an elite assassination squad? Lynamo had no time to think. While using his modified crossbow to retaliate against the short spears thrown from above, he directed everyone to retreat to the small boat.</p>
<p>The enemy&#x27;s attack was highly targeted. The rockets were for illumination and creating chaos, while the underwater submarines and crossbowmen on higher ground were there to block the retreat and snipe key figures. With a muffled thud, a black submarine crashed into the small boat Lin Mo and his group were traveling in, instantly shattering it. Everyone fell into the water. The seawater was icy cold.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo struggled to the surface, shaking the water off his face and saw a Woo locked in combat with a water ghost completely encased in a black rubber suit who had emerged from the submarine. Above, even more arrows and short spears rained down. &quot;Get behind the rocks!&quot; Limo shouted, aiming at a crossbowman on higher ground and firing an arrow. The man screamed and fell to the ground. The grey robe leader and his companions displayed astonishing combat skills.</p>
<p>Back to back, wielding crossbows and strange short club-like weapons that could launch sharp blades. They managed to temporarily deflect attacks coming from underwater and sides. Their weapons clearly demonstrated a technological advantage. Seck leader Lynn. This way, the gray robe leader suddenly shouted to Lynn Mo, pointing to a darker pile of rocks deep within the abandoned island.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s cover there. Let&#x27;s retreat there first. Lynn Emmo glanced at the direction of the black sailboats where fierce fighting was taking place. Sure, how was directing the ballisti and archers to suppress the enemy on the high ground and was trying to use the sentry boat to pick them up, but they were blocked by submarines and dense arrows and could not get close for a while. Staying in the open shallows and water would only make them easy targets.</p>
<p>Go. Lynn and Mo made a decisive order to a Woo and the others while swimming vigorously toward the pile of rocks pointed out by the greyroged man. The group scrambled onto a slippery rock formation, taking cover behind a natural shelter formed by jagged, strangely shaped rocks. Arrows and spears clanged and clattered against the stones. Sparks flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Temporarily safe, but trapped. The wings of Liberty&#x27;s assassination squad outside is tightening their encirclement and the black sail is entangled with submarines, unable to break in anytime soon. Who exactly are you people? Lenmo leaned against the cold stone, panting and looked at the gray robed leader. Half of the leader&#x27;s mask had fallen off during the battle, revealing a face that looked to be in his 40s with a thin face, high cheekbones, and deep set eyes and an old scar on the corner of his mouth. the grey rogue leader.</p>
<p>Now he should be called the scarf-faced man ripped off his tattered cloak, revealing a similarly gray but strangely textured form-fitting suit that seemed to absorb light to some extent. He glanced at Lyno, then quickly said instead of answering directly, &quot;Caesar has been eyeing these supplies for a long time. We deliberately leaked some of the transaction information, hoping to lure him out and eliminate him, but we didn&#x27;t he expect him to send his most troublesome assassination team. We ve drag you into this dot deliberately a ploy to lure the enemy out. Lin Mo&#x27;s eyes turned cold.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re using us as bait. A win-win situation that the scarred man said calmly. You got the goods and we lured out Caesar s hidden agents. It is just that the plan went slightly wrong. We underestimated the number of night owls that he looked outside.</p>
<p>However, the onet succeed so easily. Dot. He had barely finished speaking when an even more piercing shriek. unlike any sound from a bow and arrow rang out from outside. This was followed by an explosion and screams.</p>
<p>Looking through the crack in the rocks, Lynn and Mo saw several bursts of blazing white light suddenly erupt from the high point of the abandoned island where the wings of Freedom Crossbowmen were hiding, accompanied by intense flashes and a pungent odor. It was some kind of speciallymade flashbang blast. &quot;They are people,&quot; the scarred man said calmly. My mentor always said, &quot;We should always have a backup plan.&quot; Mentor. The mentor of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood.</p>
<p>With a threat from above, disrupted by the sudden attack, the pressure on the black sailboat eed dramatically. Seizing the opportunity, Sherhow directed the ballisti to concentrate their fire, finally destroying a persistent black submarine and creating an opening. The sentry ship quickly rushed in to support Lin Mo and the others. &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; Lynn Emmo no longer hesitated and led everyone towards the sentry ship. The scarred man and his companion showed no intention of boarding the ship.</p>
<p>Transaction complete. All settled. The scarred man nodded to Lynn Mo, his eyes filled with complex emotions. Secleer Lynn, your general rules are quite interesting. I hope our next meeting won&#x27;t be under such dire circumstances.</p>
<p>Also, the secret of sleeping Lin Yuan is far deeper than you imagine. that cube. You&#x27;d better watch yourself.&quot; After saying that, he and his companion quickly retreated and disappeared into the shadows deeper within the pile of rocks, as if they had never been there. Limo boarded the sentry ship and looked back, seeing only scattered fire light and the gradually subsiding sounds of battle on the abandoned island. The wings of Freedom&#x27;s assassination squad seemed to have received the retreat signal and was quickly disengaging.</p>
<p>A meticulously planned deal and ambush ended in a three-way battle with each party eventually disengaging. The Mo Yuan ship picked up everyone and began its return journey. Inside the cabin, Lynn Mo changed out of his soaked clothes, looked at the sulfur oil piled in the corner, and touched the small roll of encrypted paper that the scarred man had given him as an extra gift. The parchment contained only one line of text and one illustration. To learn about the cube, meet at the lonely tower in three days at coordinates xx y menter.</p>
<p>The mentor of the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood has finally shown himself. Meanwhile, Caesar&#x27;s assassination squad also revealed their fangs. This sea is indeed never at peace. Chapter 38. The secret meeting in the lonely tower.</p>
<p>The scale of truth. 3 days passed. Intense preparation. The aftershocks of a raid on the abandoned island had not yet subsided. The appearance of the wings of freedom assassination squad and the invitation from the stonemasons brotherhood&#x27;s mentor were like two pebbles thrown into a deep pool creating ripples within the mo yuan pavilion.</p>
<p>The seas sulfur salt peter kerosene and hemlock would secretly stored in a reinforced underground warehouse guarded by trusted confidants personally assigned by Sherhow. These supplies were both powerful tools against Caesar and potential sources of further envy and trouble. Lynn Mo did not reveal the details of the mentor invitation to most people, only informing the core members that there would be a crucial contact with a mysterious force. He entrusted the island&#x27;s defense and internal affairs entirely to Shureh How, while instructing Shin Duo Duo to strengthen internal and external information monitoring, especially to pay attention to whether the Wings of Freedom would make any new moves due to the assassination team&#x27;s failure. Such Chian&#x27;s physical health had improved considerably under careful recuperation, but she remained mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>Upon learning that Linmo was going to keep his appointment with his mentor, she remained silent for a long time before finally saying, &quot;Take this with you.&quot; She handed Lynn Mo a small amulet made from a mixture of special seaweed and the residue of that golden liquid, emitting a faint, calming, and refreshing aura. Perhaps it can help you stay clearheaded and resist some mental interference. Her heart of the ocean was acutely sensitive to energy and she vaguely sensed that this mentor was definitely not simple. Leewi eyes buried himself in the mountain of documents and the piece of ke trying to decipher more clues about the cube and the so-called ancient civilization from the storm sailboat blueprints and the scattered data brought back by sleeping forest abyss hoping to provide some reference for the meeting with Lin Mo. On the third day at dusk, Lynn Mo piloted a light and fast modified sentry boat alone, quietly leaving Muan Pavilion Island.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t take anyone with him as his mentor had explicitly requested in the secret letter. The sails were raised and the boat headed towards the coordinates marked in the letter Lonely Tower located on the northwestern edge of the SH 739 area near the border with other areas. The coordinates are located on a tiny, almost entirely steep isolated island. In the center of the island, as expected, stands a dilapidated stone tower constructed of some unknown grayish white stone. The tower&#x27;s surface is covered with modeled erosion marks and tenaciously clinging dark vines, a testament to the ravages of time and sea erosion.</p>
<p>The spire has collapsed. The tower stands approximately 20 m tall, appearing strikingly out of place and mysterious on the desolate island. Without a dock, Linmo tied his patrol boat to a protruding reef and climbed the slippery rock face to reach the small island. The sea breeze here became howling and fierce, whipping fine salt grains against his face. He gripped the short knife at his waist, cautiously surveyed his surroundings, and then walked towards the only entrance at the base of the stone tower a low deep archway.</p>
<p>Inside the archway, it was pitch black with only a few dim rays of light filtering through the broken tower top and cracks and walls. The air was cold and damp, carrying a heavy smell of mildew and the sea. The stone steps spiraled upwards, covered with moss and gravel. Lyno didn&#x27;t hesitate and stepped inside. His footsteps echoed far and wide within the empty tower.</p>
<p>He slowly ascended the stone steps, his mind highly focused, his senses amplified to the extreme. The talisman Sue Chian had given him was pressed against his chest, radiating a steady coolness. The tower seemed empty with only the marks of time. It wasn&#x27;t until he reached the third floor, the best preserved floor in the tower, that he saw a figure. There were no windows on this floor, but in the center stood a simple stone table and two stone stools.</p>
<p>On the stone table sat an old-fashioned copper oil lamp, its small flame burning steadily, illuminating a figure sitting at the table. The man was also wearing a gray inconspicuous cloak, but the hood wasn&#x27;t fully pulled up, revealing most of his face. It was the scarred man with whom he had briefly cooperated on the abandoned island. He sat there quietly, his hands folded on the stone table, calmly watching Lynn Emmo, walk up the last step. Master Lynn, please have a seat.</p>
<p>The scarred man, or rather, Mter said in a calm voice with a peculiar magnetic quality that could involuntarily quiet people down. He gestured to the stone bench opposite him. Linmo didn&#x27;t sit down immediately, his gaze sweeping over every corner of the floor. The space wasn&#x27;t large, and everything was laid out before him. Apart from the stone table, stone benches, and the oil lamp, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>He also couldn&#x27;t sense anyone else&#x27;s presence. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s just you and me. The mentor seemed to see through his thoughts. There are too many people on the abandoned island, and some things are inconvenient to say. It&#x27;s quiet and safe here.</p>
<p>At least it&#x27;s safe for now. Lyn Mo then walked to the stone bench and sat down, facing his mentor across the table. The light from the oil lamp danced on their faces, casting flickering shadows. How should I address you? Mentor or something else? Lyn Mo asked. The name doesn&#x27;t matter.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just a code name. You can call me Mentor or Greystone. The mentor&#x27;s tone remained calm. I invited you here today for two reasons. First, to apologize for the abandoned island incident.</p>
<p>Using your deal as bait was indeed illconsidered. Second, there are some things that it&#x27;s time for you to know. About that cube, about sleeping forest abyss, or about this world? Lynn Emmo cut straight to the point. A hint of appreciation flashed in the mentor&#x27;s eyes. You&#x27;re very perceptive.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#x27;s all related to these things. He sat up slightly. First, to answer your first question, that gray white cube embedded in the ancient wood, we call it a civilization node or the observer&#x27;s eye. The observer&#x27;s eye. Then, Montac found it.</p>
<p>This world is not naturally formed, nor is it a playground for gods and demons, the mentor said slowly, each word carrying immense weight. This is a testing ground for a civilization selection project. The human civilization of the old earth was on the verge of collapse due to its own various problems. One or more higher beings that we cannot understand. Perhaps even more advanced civilizations or perhaps managers of some kind of cosmic law initiated this selection.</p>
<p>Billions of human consciousnesses were projected into this simulated ocean world given different initial conditions and talents to observe how we survive, develop, compete, and cooperate in extreme environments and whether we can ultimately evolve a new order and new characteristics sufficient to continue the flame of civilization. Even though Linmo was mentally prepared, he was still shocked when he heard these words: civilization selection, higher beings, testing ground. All of this sounded so incredible yet vaguely matched the various irrationalities of this world. Where&#x27;s the evidence? Lynn Mo forced himself to calm down. The evidence lies within the observer Zup discovered deep within the sleeping abyss at the core of the restless sea and among all the marked ruins.</p>
<p>The mentor pointed upwards as if to the endless void beyond the tower. These nodes are part of the system that maintains the operation of this world and also probes for recording and observation. They collect data from specific areas, monitor energy flow, and even under certain conditions, fine-tune the experimental process. Fining like a marine mammal tide, a weather disaster, Lynn Mo immediately made the connection. Partly yes, but more often it asks about potential macro level impacts.</p>
<p>For example, the distribution of resources in certain areas, the unlocking threshold of a certain technology, or even the luck of individual samples, the menter tone carried a hint of barely perceptible sarcasm. Of course, the system has its rules and limitations which cannot be arbitrarily eliminated or excessively interfered with, otherwise the experiment would lose its meaning. It s more like a complex ecological simulator with many variables and triggering conditions added. As Lynn Mo processed this information, many questions in his mind began to unravel and connect. Why were there sign-in system, talents, and various illogical supply boxes and blueprints? Why were there patterns in the sea monster invasions and natural disasters? Why were there clearly unnatural landmarks like the eye of the storm and the path of eternal frost? The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood.</p>
<p>Do you know all this? What is your goal? Then mont. We are a group of people who glimpsed the truth earlier or rather who were unwilling to be merely observed samples the mentors eyes deepened. Our goal is not to resist that seems meaningless at the moment. Our goal is to understand to utilize and to win over understand the rules and vulnerabilities of this system. Utilize the knowledge and technology left in the relics and nodes to accelerate our own development.</p>
<p>strive to obtain a higher evaluation at the end of the final selection to win the qualification to go to the new world or to obtain administrator privileges to stay in this testing ground. Administrator privileges. Lynmo recalled the title he received when his island was upgraded and a vague feeling he had. You approached me for the purpose of cooperation. Lynmo looked directly into his mentor&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>You have potential, Linmo, the mentor frankly admitted. Double SSS level talents and 100fold amplification system are an extremely rare combination of advantages in the early stages of this testing ground. You are cautious, strategic, and know how to hide and develop. What&#x27;s even more remarkable is that you have begun to try to establish order, which in the eyes of advanced observers may be more valuable than mere military conquest. Moreover, you have come into contact with and influenced the observer&#x27;s eye, which in itself means that you have entered some kind of watch list of the system.</p>
<p>By cooperating, we can share intelligence about the system and the ruins, support each other when exploring dangerous areas, and exchange the technologies and resources we need. We don&#x27;t need to merge. We can remain independent, but we must coordinate on key objectives, the mentor stated. For example, exploring the eye of a storm in the turbulent sea where there may be more advanced nodes or databases or dealing with Caesar and the other sample forces that may exist behind him. Is there something else behind Caesar? Lynn Emmo caught the key information.</p>
<p>The rise of Wings of Freedom has been too fast and too smooth. Caesar&#x27;s S-rank talent, Wrath of Thunder, is certainly powerful, but that alone is not enough for him to integrate so many resources and manpower in such a short time, or even build a decent fleet, the mentor said in a deep voice. We suspect that he may have also come into contact with some ruins or nodes, gained some kind of support, or made contact with a force that has also glimpsed part of the truth, but has chosen a different path. His frantic purchasing and preparations are not just aimed at you. Lynn Mo remained silent.</p>
<p>The amount of information was overwhelming. He needed time to process it. Cooperating with the Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood carried both benefits and risks. They clearly knew more, but were also more mysterious and harder to control. I need time to think about it.</p>
<p>Limo finally said, &quot;Of course that the mentor wasn&#x27;t he surprised. Cooperation is based on voluntariness and trust. You can think about it slowly. As a token of sincerity and compensation for the abandoned island, he took out a thin gray booklet that was neither paper nor leather from his pocket and pushed it in front of Linmo. This is an introductory manual on basic identification and application of primary energy ruins as well as a map marking the locations of three relatively safe secondary ruins in SH 739 and the adjacent area which may contain clues to star steel substitute minerals or deep sea ironwood.</p>
<p>You can verify its authenticity. Lynn Mo looked at the booklet in a neatly folded map but didn&#x27;t immediately reach for it. What&#x27;s the price? There has no extra cost. Consider it an investment. The mentor stood up, the oil lamp casting a long shadow on the model tower wall.</p>
<p>A storm is coming. Lyno Caesar s revenge is just a prelude. The real test may come from the depths of the ocean or it may come from the system itself. Whether you become a struggling pawn on the chessboard or try to understand the game and even influence the rules, the choice is yours. Do he walked toward the broken staircase leading to the top of the tower, his voice disappearing into the darkness with his figure.</p>
<p>The meeting of the lonely tower ends here. If you&#x27;ve thought it through, you can contact me through the old method. Take care, Storm King. The footsteps faded into the distance and eventually disappeared. Silence returned to the tower with only the flickering flame of the oil lamp burning quietly, and Lin Mo&#x27;s own clearly audible heartbeat remaining.</p>
<p>He sat for a long time before slowly picking up the gray booklet and map. The booklet was cold to the touch, and the text and illustrations on it were ancient and strange. The map clearly marked three coordinates far from the main shipping lanes with brief explanations and risk warnings next to them. The tip of the iceberg of the truth has finally been revealed. It is cruel and grand, yet it also brings an unprecedented sense of clarity.</p>
<p>He packed his things, blew out the oil lamp, got up, and walked into the darkness, descending the stone tower along the way he had come. Outside the tower, night had fallen, and the sea wind howled. The distant sea was pitch black, as if concealing endless secrets and dangers. But Lynn Mos heart was brighter than when he arrived. Knowing the rules of the game, even just a part of them, is always better than groping blindly in the dark.</p>
<p>He leaped onto the sentry boat and untied the mooring ropes. The sails rose, the bow cleaved through the waves, and the boat resolutely sailed toward the direction of Mayuan Pavilion and toward that increasingly clear course of destiny. The road ahead may be more difficult, but the direction is already different. Chapter 39, the traces of Star Steel. The early days of the Alliance.</p>
<p>Upon returning from the isolated tower, Linmo did not immediately reveal the shocking truth of the civilization selection project. The information at that level was too impactful and prematurely disclosing it would only cause unnecessary panic and chaos. He only briefly mentioned to the core members his contact with a mentor, confirming that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was currently in a cooperative rather than hostile relationship and produced the rune manual in the ruins map. Leewi practically pounced on the grave booklet, his eyes wide behind his glasses, his fingers trembling as he traced the strange yet regular lines and symbols. This isn&#x27;t just decoration.</p>
<p>These structures contain incredibly precise logic for guiding and converting energy. Although it&#x27;s only the most basic of the basics, the principles are universal. If you can understand and apply it, even the simplest sturdiness, corrosion resistance, and energy slowing runes will have a qualitative impact on the construction and defense of the storm ship. Such Chian also leaned closer to sense it carefully, her brows furrowing slightly. The energy fluctuations of these runes are very peculiar, unlike the electromagnetic or chemical reactions commonly seen in our world.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re closer to the underlying power of the cube in the sleeping forest abyss. They are very stable but also very cold. Can I learn it? Can I use it? Sure. How was more concerned about practical applications? We need time to study it. And even more so, we need practical materials to inscribe and test it that Leeway forced himself to calm down.</p>
<p>The booklet mentions that inscribing runes requires special energy conducting media such as certain high purity mineral powders, specific biological bone powders, or fragments of energy crystals. The little bit of energy storage crystal micro we have might come in handy, but it is far from enough. Dot. There are three locations on the ruins map. One of which is marked may contain star steel associated ore or or similar high conductivity minerals.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo pointed to a coordinate on the map located on the edge of the SH738 area, a complex body of water known as Echo Canyon. This is what we urgently need right now. With enough energy conducting materials, not only can Rune research advance, but it may also have a miraculous effect on strengthening the refined iron that replaces star steel. I know Echo Canyon Chin Duo interjected. He had been gathering intelligence lately.</p>
<p>It has said that the underwater terrain is extremely complex with strong currents and strange noises, hence the name. Several expeditions went in before and never came out again. Rumor has it that there are highly aggressive bioluminescent jellyfish swarms and some kind of strange fish that can mimic sounds to lure prey. It has quite risky to we have to go no matter the risks that Lynn Mo made up his mind. The construction of a storm ship cannot stop.</p>
<p>We need more advanced materials to meet the challenges of Caesar and the future. Sure, how you are in charge of selecting a capable expedition team. The personnel must be excellent and the equipment must be sufficient. Leeway, you will accompany the team and be responsible for mineral identification and collection. Such an he looked at the girl whose complexion was still not good.</p>
<p>You stay on the island to continue to recuperate and at the same time try to study the basic parts of the rune book about early warning and protection to see if they can be applied to the island&#x27;s defense. No, I&#x27;m going to sue Chan shook her head. Her tone firm. The heart of the ocean is most sensitive to underwater environments and energy anomalies and can give early warnings of undercurrents and dangerous creatures. In a place like Echo Canyon, eyes and ears alone are not enough.</p>
<p>My body is fine. At least I can identify danger to Lin and Mo looked at her stubborn eyes and knew he couldn&#x27;t persuade her. Su Chanjian was gentle on the outside but strong on the inside. Once she made up her mind, it was hard to change it. Okay, but you must stay in the middle of the team, mainly responsible for sensing and not participate in combat unless necessary.</p>
<p>Sure, how arrange for someone to protect her. Understood. Sure, how nodded. Chin duo duo Lin Mo continued Yuri in charge of two things. First, use the supplies we obtained from the abandoned island trade, especially the hemlock wood to expedite the conversion of at least two fast auxiliary warships capable of carrying light crossbows to serve as escorts and firepower supplements for the MOU on.</p>
<p>Second, try to establish deeper contact with the Dragon Soul. It doesn&#x27;t t necessarily have to be a military alliance, but we can discuss intelligence sharing, specific resource exchanges, and joint action plans against the wings of freedom. Also, Sutley revealed to them the intelligence that Caesar might receive unknown support and that his targets might not be limited to us. Join forces with Dragon Soul. Chandwa&#x27;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a brilliant move. Dragon Soul is powerful and upright. If we can reach an agreement on fighting against wings of freedom, the pressure on us will be much less. Even if we can&#x27;t openly join forces, some covert cooperation is still good. I&#x27;ll go prepare the proposal now.</p>
<p>After the meeting ended, everyone immediately went their separate ways. Sherhow carefully selected 15 people from among the combat personnel and peripheral members with exploration experience. Together with himself, Lin Mo, Leewi, Su Chian, and Xiao Tai and Lu Fong who had become increasingly calm and reliable after recovering from their injuries. They formed a 20 person expedition team. In terms of equipment, in addition to conventional weapons, they also brought improved underwater breathing tubes made from hollow plant stems and waterproof membranes.</p>
<p>Speciallymade stabroof gel suits woven from a mixture of treated sea animal skin and vine fibers, high-intensity crystal amps activated by energy storing crystal fragments, a large number of ropes and grappling hooks, and several simple mineral resonators that Leeway had hastily made overnight small devices that could produce a weak reaction to specific highc conductivity minerals based on a principle mentioned in the rune manual. Two sentry boats, which had undergone preliminary modifications and were equipped with small sails and extra or positions, carried the expedition team and quietly left the island the following morning, heading northwest towards Echo Canyon. After sailing for most of the day, the seascape ahead began to change. The once open waters were now dotted with numerous reefs and small islands, and the seaater had deepened in color, turning a dark green. A faint, salty, and subtly sulfurous dampness filled the air.</p>
<p>Most peculiarly, as we ventured deeper, various faint sounds began to echo in our ears. Sometimes like the distant sound of a conch shell horn, sometimes like the deep song of whales, and sometimes like a sharp metallic grating noise. These sounds mingled together coming from all directions making it difficult to pinpoint their source and unsettling the mind. This is at the outer edge of Echo Canyon Da sure how check the map and sea conditions then order the boats to slow down. Everyone be on high alert.</p>
<p>The sound can interfere with judgment. Watch out for underwater currents and reefs. Su Chian sat in the center of one of the boats, eyes closed and focused. Her heart of the ocean was fully deployed, acting like an invisible sonar scanning the surrounding seawater. The underwater terrain is indeed complex with many canyons and fissures, and the currents are unpredictable.</p>
<p>There are many signs of life, mostly small fish and crustaceans, but some individuals with stronger energy responses are swimming in the depths, their forms unclear. Also, she suddenly opened her eyes, pointing to a seemingly calm, dark area of water to her left. They the underwater rock walls emit strong intermittent energy radiation matching the characteristics of the inert energy conducting vein described in the manual. It might be the associated mineral we&#x27;re looking for. Leeway immediately picked up the resonator and aimed it in that direction.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the crystal pointer on the instrument began to vibrate slightly, emitting an almost inaudible buzzing sound. &quot;Go take a look. Be careful,&quot; Lin Mo ordered. The boat approached cautiously. It was a steep underwater cliff, dark in color, covered with a thick layer of dark green seaweed and barnacles.</p>
<p>Near the surface, tiny shimmering dark blue crystallin substances could be vaguely seen embedded in the rock face. It&#x27;s blue veneer crystal, a good primary energy conducting medium. Leat, the purity looks good. And where blue veneer crystal appears, it&#x27;s very likely that magnetite or cobaltite is also present, which are important additives to replace star pattern steel. However, just as they were about to lower the ropes and tools to begin collecting, Su Chanchians expression changed.</p>
<p>Watch out, something is coming up from the deep valley. It&#x27;s moving very fast. The energy reaction is very strong. There&#x27;s more than one. As soon as the words were spoken, the dark waters suddenly churned.</p>
<p>Several tentacle-like creatures as thick as an arm, translucent and shimmering with an eerie phosphoresence, burst out of the water and swirled toward the nearest boat. Their heads were hidden at the base of their tentacles, obscuring their full appearance. But their open suckers were filled with fine, gleaming bone spurs. It&#x27;s a phosphorescent ghost beard. It&#x27;s very aggressive and its tentacles have paralyzing toxins.</p>
<p>Sukianken exclams. Sure house shouted sharply. The soldiers on the ship immediately raised their shields and weapons. Ziaoai, quick as lightning, cleaved a tentacle that was coiled towards the ship&#x27;s side with a single stroke. Fluorescent slime spurted from the severed end, emitting a sweet fishy odor.</p>
<p>Lu Fong and the others also used their spears and machetes to defend themselves. Lynn Mo raised his modified crossbow and aimed at the underwater shadows from which the tentacles emerged. He didn&#x27;t fire immediately but waited. His keen senses honed by his rudimentary archery skills allowed him to perceive that while the tentacles moved swiftly, they seemed somewhat uncoordinated as if interfered with by some unseen force. Is it an echo? Or he suddenly remembered that the rune manual mentioned that certain basic rune combinations could interfere with creatures that rely on specific frequencies to perceive or act.</p>
<p>Liebe, is there any simple rune about sound or a frequency interference in the manual? Linmo shouted. Lie Jang was nervously dodging an attack from a tentacle when he heard this. He was stunned for a moment, then quickly searched his mind. Yes, there is a very simple basic configuration of silent ripple which can theoretically emit a fixed low frequency fluctuation that makes most organisms feel uncomfortable but requires an energy conducting medium to activate and the range is very small. Use blue crystal.</p>
<p>Try it now. Lenmo shouted as he used a crossbow bolt to force back a tentacle. Leewei frantically pulled a small sample of blue veined crystal he had collected earlier from another transaction from his bag and then took out a speciallymade engraving knife, the tip of which was mixed with a trace amount of energy conducting metal. He forced himself to calm down, recalled the patterns in the booklet, and with trembling hands quickly engraved an extremely simple rune consisting of three arcs and two dots on the surface of the blue vein crystal. When the last stroke was completed, Leeway, following the instructions in the manual, concentrated his meager mental energy, or rather attention into it, buzz.</p>
<p>The dark blue glow on the surface of the blue variegated crystal suddenly brightened slightly, and an almost invisible ripple of distorted air spread rapidly from its center. The effects are immediate. The frenzied phosphorescent tentacles that have been attacking so aggressively suddenly froze as if struck by an invisible whip, convulsing violently and quickly retreating underwater. Even the annoying jumbled echoes around them seemed to diminish for a moment. It worked.</p>
<p>Everyone was both surprised and delighted. Now&#x27;s the time. Quickly gather the resources, then leave this area immediately. Lynn and Mo made a decisive decision. The duration of the rune effect was unknown.</p>
<p>There was no time to waste. Under Sher How&#x27;s command, several agile team members wearing stabroof rubber suits quickly slid down the ropes and use special tools to chisel at the rock face, rapidly collecting the shimmering blue crystals and some dark metallic looking ores from the vicinity and stuffing them into waterproof bags. The whole process was tense but orderly and in less than 10 minutes, several large bags were filled. withdraw. Knowing when to stop, Lin Mo immediately gave the order.</p>
<p>The two boats quickly turned around, rowing and sailing, speeding back the way they had come. Only after leaving the Echo Canyon did the annoying noise and potential dangers gradually fade away. The hall yielded over 20 kg of blue veneer crystal and several kg of ore suspected to be magnetite and cobaltite. More importantly, it verified the practicality of rune knowledge. On the return journey, Sue Chanchian sensed the ores and whispered to Lanimo, &quot;These ores do indeed contain metallic components similar to the description of star pattern steel, although very weak.</p>
<p>But after refining and rune enhancement, they might actually meet the requirements for substitution. That mentor didn&#x27;t lie to us.&quot; Lynn Emmo nodded and looked in the direction of the Ink Abyss Pavilion. This expedition was very fruitful. Not only did they obtain muchneeded materials, but they also made preliminary verification of the power of runes. More importantly, the team&#x27;s coordination and adaptability in actual combat were honed.</p>
<p>When they returned to the island, Chin Duo Duo also brought good news. Dragon Soul has agreed in principle to establish a limited strategic cooperative relationship. Chin Woodway Sace was filled with barely suppressed smuggness. They acknowledge our stance against the wings of freedom, are willing to share intelligence deeply regarding Caesar-es movements and suspected supporters, and have promised to conduct diversionary operations on the flanks or logistical lines of the wings of freedom when they launch a large-scale attack against the Mo Yuan pavilion. In exchange, we need to regularly provide non-core intelligence on sea beast tides, abnormal celestial phenomena, and the ancient ruins that we have obtained.</p>
<p>In addition, they are very interested in the basic rune technology that we may have mastered and hope to conduct academic exchanges in the future. A very pragmatic collaboration, no binding obligations, but mutual support and mutual benefit. This aligns perfectly with Lynn Mo&#x27;s current expectations. Okay, you and the others can finalize the specific details. Lynn and Mo agreed.</p>
<p>also inform everyone that starting tomorrow we should concentrate our efforts and use the newly acquired ores and rune knowledge to accelerate the final construction and enhancement of the stormship. Caesar 1T give us much time. That night in the workshops on Mayuen Pavilion Island, the furnace fires burned continuously. Leewi along with several quickwitted craftsmen began experimenting with using newly acquired energy conducting mineral powder to inscribe the most basic hardness and corrosion resistance runes on key parts of the ship&#x27;s hull. Although their techniques were clumsy and the failure rate was high as the shimmering runes gradually took shape on the keel ribs and hull.</p>
<p>Everyone could sense that the ship was undergoing some indescribable fundamental transformation. Linmo stood on a nearly completed ship&#x27;s deck, stroking a piece of newly refined metal ingot with dark blue speckles in his hand. This was a star- patterned steel substitute alloy, initially refined from cobaltite and magnetite. With materials in hand, a direction was found. With runes in hand, a beginning was set.</p>
<p>And with allies in hand, a prototype was formed. Next, it&#x27;s a matter of waiting for Caesar to make his move or taking the initiative to confront the eye of the storm in the turbulent sea. The sea breeze rustled, causing the newly hung Emo Yuan battle flag to flutter a top the ship&#x27;s deck. Although the sea is vast, and the undercurrents are swift, the hand gripping the rudder has become even more steady and powerful. Chapter 40.</p>
<p>King of Storms. Leewi&#x27;s eyes were bloodshot, but his gaze was frighteningly bright. He pointed to the huge sailing ship that was already taking shape in the center of the workshop, his voice trembling with excitement. The sturdiness runes on all the main kees and ribs are complete. The corrosion resistance rune arrays in key areas of the hull have also passed testing.</p>
<p>The bow ram and rudder reinforced with a new alloy have been installed. Linmo the storm sailboat is ready to be launched. Everyone inside the shed held their breath. After nearly 2 months of preparation, trading, exploration, research, and roundthe-clock construction, the ship carrying the future hopes of the Mo Yuan pavilion was finally completed. It is 35 m long with a towering main mast.</p>
<p>Its streamlined hull is primarily constructed of hemlock wood with key areas inlaid with alloy plates dotted with dark blue starlight. Under certain lighting, the fine runes engraved on the hull using blue crystal powder shimmer with a faint, almost imperceptible halo. Line stepped forward and reached out to touch the cool solid hole. The surface felt heavy, carrying the unique scent of wood and metal along with a faint tingling sensation from lingering runic energy. This was no ordinary ship.</p>
<p>It was the culmination of all the technology, resources, and wisdom currently available to the Mo Yuan Pavilion and a crucial asset for him to face future challenges and uncover the truth of the world. &quot;How are the preparations for the sea trial going?&quot; he asked. Sure, Howley stood at attention and said, &quot;The crew has been selected. They are all experienced and trustworthy brothers. Supplies, weapons, and spare rigging have all been loaded.</p>
<p>As you requested, the trial voyage will avoid the main waterway and detour to the northeastern outer waters under our control. Meanwhile, several modified sentry boats arranged by manager Chien will be on guard nearby to prevent spying. Very good, Lynn. Emmon nodded, his gaze sweeping over the tired but expectant faces around him. This afternoon, 1 hour before sunset, we will launch for a trial voyage.</p>
<p>Sure. How you will be the captain responsible for navigation and command. Leeway, you will be on board monitoring the operation of the rune. I will personally oversee the operation. Yes, everyone responded in unison.</p>
<p>The news spread like wildfire throughout the entire Mayuan Pavilion Island. All members, whether directly involved in the construction or not, spontaneously flocked to the newly built makeshift dock on the east side of the island. There the storm sailboat officially named Ming by Lin and Mo is quietly moed on the log pave slipway the red cloth covering its bow fluttering gently in a breeze. Such Chian stood beside Lin Mo and said softly, &quot;It&#x27;s beautiful and very powerful. I can feel a dormant power inside it which is of the same origin as those ores and runes but is more concentrated.</p>
<p>I hope it&#x27;s strong enough to take us anywhere we want to go and face any enemy we need to face. Lynn and Mo held her hand. Chian once the trial voyage is over and things have stabilized, we should do that thing. Such Chanchian knew what he meant upgrading the island to level 5. The materials had already been prepared in excess.</p>
<p>The upgrade progress had been suppressed partly to avoid provoking Caesar&#x27;s premature and reckless attack and partly to wait for the completion of the MOU on ensuring sufficient mobility and deterrent power. Now the time had come in the afternoon the sun was setting in the west. The auspicious time has come launch with a deep shout from sure how the last few cables securing the hall were cut. The logs rolled along the inclined slide. The heavy MO yuon emitting a low, grinding sound, slowly and steadily sliding into the sea, splashing up huge waves.</p>
<p>The ship entered the water and floated steadily. The pre-esigned ballast and hole structure ensured excellent initial stability. The sailors immediately sprang into action, raising auxiliary sails and adjusting the rudder. The Mo Yuan began to carve elegant arcs across the sea. Lynn Mo led his core members onto a nearby escort patrol ship and followed closely behind.</p>
<p>He held a moninocular telescope, carefully observing the every move of the Moon. Its maneuverability was excellent and its speed was significantly superior to any other vessel of its class seen so far. Under Sher House command, the Mo Yuan underwent several tactical maneuver tests, including turning into the wind, zigzagging, and emergency stops, all of which performed admirably. Leeway continuously reported the status of the rune array through a makeshift communication device, a rudimentary solution made of rope and bell. The rune energy in the bow area is stable.</p>
<p>Slight fluctuations in the port side reinforcement area within the normal break-in range. The main KE&#x27;s resonance frequency is good and no signs of cracks have been found. After more than an hour of sea trials, all data met or even exceeded expectations. When Mo Yuan made a large circle and slowly sailed back to anchor near the dock, a burst of enthusiastic cheers erupted on the shore. We did it.</p>
<p>We did it. The Inc. Abyss, our ship. Lyn Mo leaped onto the deck of the Mo Yuan. The solid wooden planks beneath his feet providing a reassuring feel.</p>
<p>He walked to the bow, gazing at the endless sea, a surge of pride welling up within him. With his ship, his actions would no longer be confined to the vicinity of the island. Exploring more distant waters, searching for more resources and relics, and even launching proactive attacks would all become possible. He turned to face all those gathered on the deck and on the shore and declared loudly, &quot;The completion of the Mo Yuan is the achievement of all of us. From this day forward, we have a powerful tool to traverse the seas, but this is only the first step.&quot; He paused, his gaze sharpening.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure how Chin Duo Duo Such Chan Lee way, come with me back to the council hall. The rest of you under Sure House&#x27;s arrangement will take turns familiarizing yourselves with the operation of the MOU on and undergo adaptive training. Within 3 days, I want to see it achieve basic combat capability. Yes. Back in the council chamber, as soon as the door closed, Lynn Emmo immediately brought up the island upgrade interface, which he hadn&#x27;t paid attention to for a long time.</p>
<p>Current island level, level 4, 25,600 m. Upgrade to level five requires 51,200 foundation stones, 256,000 wood, 128,000 stone, 51,200 iring, and 100 any energy crystals. Sufficient resources detected. Upgrade now. Note, the top 10 survivors worldwide who upgrade to island level 5 will receive special rewards and be announced serverwide.</p>
<p>The amount of resources needed later on is astronomical, especially iron ingots and energy crystals. However, the frantic accumulation, trading, profitering, operations, and relic harvesting over the past 2 months have already filled Lin Moe&#x27;s warehouse to the brim. He not only has enough quantity, but the quality of many resources far exceeds the basic requirements. The resources are all ready. Chin Duo Duo rubbed his hands, a mix of nervousness and excitement in his voice.</p>
<p>Boss, are we really going to promote him now? This announcement will put us right in the spotlight. And what about Caesar&#x27;s side and those eyes lurking in the shadows? It&#x27;s precisely because we have eyes that we need to upgrade even more. Lynmo&#x27;s tone was calm, but undeniable. The Emo Yuan has given us confidence. A level five island will bring new functions and stronger defense.</p>
<p>More importantly, we can&#x27;t miss the rewards for being in the top 10 across the entire server. We must seize that first place. I support it. Such Chian said being timid and hesitant on one T solve anything. When it has time to draw our swords, we should draw them.</p>
<p>Our strength no longer needs to be hidden in the shadows. D sure how nodded. We&#x27;ll meet force with force. Now we have ships, enhanced defenses, and the latent synergy of the dragon soul. It&#x27;s time to let the wings of freedom know who the true master of this sea is.</p>
<p>Leeway adjusted his glasses. A level five island may unlock more advanced building templates or research options which are crucial to our technological development. I suggest that after upgrading, we immediately begin to build a more complete rune laboratory and advanced workshop. Seeing that everyone was in agreement, Lynn Emmoer hesitated. He took a deep breath and pressed the upgrade button on the virtual interface.</p>
<p>consumes 51,200 foundation stones, 256,000 wood, 128,000 stone, 51,200 iron ingots, and 100 energy storage crystals. Micro resources deducted. Island upgrade begins. Estimated upgrade time: 10 minutes. Island defenses will be temporarily disabled during the upgrade.</p>
<p>Please ensure your safety. The entire island trembled slightly, like a sleeping behemoth, beginning to stretch its body. The seawater receded from the edges and new land rose from the water with a rumble, rapidly solidifying and expanding. The originally planned areas extended outwards, expanding at a visible rate. Everyone held their breath and waited.</p>
<p>The shaking stopped after more than 9 minutes. Upgrade complete. Congratulations. Your island has been successfully upgraded to level 5, 102,400 m. You are the first survivor in the world to upgrade your island to level five.</p>
<p>Special rewards title King of the Storm special building blueprint basic rune tower plus 10 free attribute points. Serverwide announcement coming soon. It&#x27;s here. Almost simultaneously, every survivor, regardless of their location or activity, was forced to see a dazzling golden system announcement that spanned their entire field of vision. Serverwide announcement.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Survivor Lynn Mo for becoming the first player globally to upgrade their personal island to level five. They are hereby awarded the exclusive title King of the Storm. This announcement is made to encourage them. The announcement flashed three times in a row. Then the world chat exploded.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of silence, the information flow exploded like a tsunami. Holy crap, level five. Someone&#x27;s reached level five. Then Montac. That name sounds familiar.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t he the one who sold cold weather supplies before? King of the storm. That title is awesome. First, first again, could it be the same anonymous Big Shot Jay, who was the first to level up to level two and three, and now Lyn Mo, who was the first to level up to level five. The person upstairs makes sense. Mr.</p>
<p>Jay has always been mysterious, and the sudden appearance of Linmo is truly terrifying. Wow, you&#x27;re amazing. Does the master need any accessories on his legs? Coordinates. I need a powerful ally. Didn&#x27;t Caesar, the leader of Wings of Liberty, declare that he was going to be number one? How come someone else snatched it from him? Ah, what a slap in the face.</p>
<p>Where are the Wings of Liberty people? Come out and show yourselves. The regional and national channels were equally a buzz. The regional channel where Mo Yuan Pavilion was located was instantly flooded with posts with people both familiar and unfamiliar with Lynn Mo going crazy asking questions, offering congratulations or testing the waters. Some perceptive individuals have already connected Lynn Mo, Mr. J, King of the Storm, and the previously elusive Emo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>A clear and powerful image of a new force is rapidly taking shape in everyone&#x27;s minds. At the Dragon Soul Command Center, Xiao Ji Gang looked at the announcement, paused for a moment, then smiled. It really is him. He&#x27;s been silent until now, but now he&#x27;s made a stunning move. Issue a notice to congratulate Lynn Mo in the official name of Dragon Soul.</p>
<p>At the same time, raise the priority level for contacting Mo Yuan Pavilion. This king of storm will be our most important partner in the southeast sea and possibly our strongest shield. On the main island of Wings of Freedom, Caesar smashed the wooden table in front of him with a punch. His face ashen Linmo. Is that Linmo again? Investigate.</p>
<p>Find out thoroughly about his island location and the composition of his forces. Also, is that Jim? Confirm immediately. Sir, we&#x27;ve recently lost several reconnaissance ships sent to the SH7 area, and we suspect at all costs. I need to know everything. Caesar roared.</p>
<p>The first reward, the Storm King, is good. Very good. When that person&#x27;s promise arrives, I will show you who the true king is. In a dimly lit secret room of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, the mentor put down an ancient stone slab, and the figure under his gray robe seemed to move slightly. Lyno has reached this point so quickly.</p>
<p>The spark of civilization seems to have become clearer as a result. Interestingly, we need to accelerate the deciphering of the core ruins of the restless sea. We need to find the key faster than him. Inside the Mo Yuan Pavilion council hall, Chin Duodo looked at the channel that was being flooded with messages, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and couldn&#x27;t help but grin. Now, we can&#x27;t keep a low profile even if we want to.</p>
<p>Boss, your title of King of Storms is really cool and attracts a lot of hatred. Lynmo looked calmly at the newly added title, King of Storms. Effect, all attributes plus 5, sea travel speed plus 10%, slight increase in team morale and defense when facing stormtype natural disasters. It has a tribute bar, as well as the basic rune tower blueprint that was flashing with purple light. What&#x27;s coming will come.</p>
<p>Notify all crew members that the island has expanded and that defense and functional zones are being redesigned. Double patrols, especially at night. The Mo Yuan is on level two combat readiness and ready to set sail at any time. He walked to the window and looked out at the island, which had expanded several times over and seemed more spacious and full of potential than the Mo Yuon ship, which lay dormant like a giant beast on the distant sea. Caesar won&#x27;t let this go, and we need more resources, more intelligence, and more power.</p>
<p>The title king of the storm isn&#x27;t just for show. He turned around, his eyes blazing. 3 days later, the Mo Yuan will embark on its first expedition to the edge of the restless sea to investigate the source of the energy anomalies. At the same time, we will begin construction of the primary rune tower. We must quickly transform the advantage of this first advancement into tangible combat power.</p>
<p>The storm has come and the throne has just been erected. But the real journey has only just begun. Chapter 41. The rise of the rune tower undercurrent surge. Half an hour has passed since the golden light that was announced serverwide disappeared, but the speed at which messages are being spammed in the world chat channel has not slowed down at all.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo turned off most channel notifications, keeping only the core member group and one-way communication with Dragon Soul. Even so, the icons for private chat requests and friend requests were still flashing wildly in the corner, their numbers increasing every second. At least a thousand messages chin duo duo glance at his equally packed interface and clicked his tongue. There are people shouting 666. People asking to be taken care of, people wanting to cooperate.</p>
<p>And of course, many more just trying to find out the truth. Caesar s side is quiet, not openly jumping up and down, but that s even more unsettling. He as plotting something dot sure how stood in front of the redrawn island map. Arms crossed. Our area has more than doubled and our defenses need to be redone.</p>
<p>Weve added two patrol shifts and the MON is ready to set sail at any time. But passive defense is centi the solution. Dot. Such an placed a glass of warm water next to Linmo and said softly. Someone on the regional channel revealed that Wings of Liberty have recently been buying up large quantities of exploding crystals and resilient beast sinnus.</p>
<p>Both of which are key materials for making large catapults and heavy crossbows. They may be planning a long range attack. There are also ship movements. Dot. Leeway pulled up the information he had compiled from various sources.</p>
<p>At least three Freedom Wings fleets have left their publicly known anchorages in the past two days, and their whereabouts are unknown. Our reconnaissance ships dare not follow too far, but their general direction seems to be encircling us in the outer waters. Lyn Mo took a sip of water and tapped the edge of the restless sea area on the map with his fingertip. Our first expedition plan remains unchanged, and the priority of our objective even needs to be raised. We can&#x27;t wait for Caesar to be ready, but before that, we must stabilize our home base first.</p>
<p>He looked at Leeway. Beginner rune tower. Can it be built now? How long will it take? Leeway immediately perked up and pulled up the detailed information on the purple blueprint. Yes, the core materials are one energy conduction crystal core, 50 units of blue vein crystal, and 100 units of refined iron. We have all the other basic resources.</p>
<p>The energy conduction crystal core can be replaced by our highest quality energy storage crystal micro for initial charging and rune imprinting. The effect may be slightly reduced, but starting it should be no problem. If we build at full capacity, we should choose the newly built inner fortress zone in the center of the island. It will take about 36 to 48 hours. Too slow.</p>
<p>Lin Mo shook his head. Use the accelerate construction privilege. Once each island reaches level five, it gains one accelerated construction opportunity per week, which significantly reduces the time required to build a single structure. This is a hidden perk known only to owners of level five islands. Use it on this.</p>
<p>Shendu duo felt a pang of regret. Why not use it to accelerate the workshop or the shipyard? The rune tower is a strategic building, Linmo said decisively. The blueprint description mentions that it can slightly improve the stability of all rune effects within the island&#x27;s range and provide basic rune detection and interference capabilities. It may even unlock more advanced rune research options. This is key to our technological leadership and we must erect it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With it, the island&#x27;s overall defense and the subsequent reinforcement of the MOUN can be qualitatively improved. Without further hesitation, he allocated resources, selected a construction location, and directly used his one-time acceleration privilege. Construction of the basic rune tower has begun. Use the accelerate construction perk. Estimated completion time, 6 hours.</p>
<p>In the center of the island on the open ground, designated as the inner fortress area. The sounds of hammering and moving suddenly filled the air. Under the personal supervision of core members, the best craftsmen took turns working, and a large amount of resources were transported in an orderly manner. A stone tower with a hexagonal base and a compact structure rose from the ground at a speed visible to the naked eye. Amid the construction boom, Linmo did not relax his surveillance of the outside world.</p>
<p>He authorized Shien Duo Duo in his capacity as the business manager under the king of storms to release three concise announcements on regional and national channels. I moan pavilion is willing to engage in fair trade with all survivors who uphold goodwill and abide by basic rules and a supply of various materials especially food building materials and basic tools is stable. Second, Mo Yuan Pavilion possesses a certain level of armed force which aims to protect itself and safeguard the safety of its allies. It has no intention of provoking disputes, but will retaliate swiftly against any unwarranted infringement. Third, we thank the Dragon Soul organization for their congratulations.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan Pavilion cherishes its friendly relationship with all those who uphold order. The announcement was worded neither serville nor overbearing, demonstrating both strength and an open attitude, while clearly defining red lines and emphasizing the friendly relationship with Dragon Soul, implicitly conveying a deterrent. Immediately, the sentiment within the channel shifted again with many smaller factions and lone powerhouses beginning to express goodwill while the provocative remarks of wings of freedom were significantly suppressed. But the undercurrents will clearly not stop because of this. For hours later, the team responsible for monitoring and deciphering communications brought an urgent message.</p>
<p>We have intercepted a suspected encrypted communication segment between senior members of Freedom Wings. The decryption is incomplete, but the keywords include goods received, testing ground, area 3, and before the tide. The member&#x27;s expression was grave. Area three, according to the nautical charts we know, likely refers to a broken reef area between us and the turbulent sea, where the terrain is complex and there are often unusual eddies. Before the tide, Such Chanhan looked at the sky outside the window.</p>
<p>There&#x27;ll be a big tide tomorrow evening. They may have received some kind of goods in that area and plan to conduct a test in area 3 before tomorrow&#x27;s high tide. Sure, how analyzed. What kind of test? a new type of weapon or something aimed at us or at the restless sea. Lin Mo walked to the newly posted more detailed nautical chart, his gaze falling on the broken reef area, area three and the edge of the restless sea behind it, marked in dark red and constantly flashing with tiny lightning symbols.</p>
<p>Our expedition was originally planned to proceed to the edge of the turbulent sea for reconnaissance in 3 days, he mused. But what if Caesar s men are already operating in the island and reef area ahead tomorrow carrying unidentified goods? We can&#x27;t he let them cause trouble right under our noses especially on the only route to the turbulent sea. Su Shian added that would put us in a very passive position. Dot. Moreover, this could be an opportunity.</p>
<p>Do lewi pushed up his glasses. A glint of light flashing behind the lenses. If what they&#x27;re testing is related to runes, energy, or that unknown civilization, we might be able to observe it up close or even intercept samples. Lynn Emmo turn around, his gaze sweeping over everyone. Plan changed.</p>
<p>Rune Tower construction will proceed as scheduled. Sure. How? Immediately select the most elite combat personnel to replenish the Mo Yuon supplies and weapons, especially underwater combat equipment and protection. Leeway, take all your detection equipment and rune resonators. Shendo Duo, stay on the island.</p>
<p>Coordinate the defense and maintain uninterrupted communication with the dragon soul. If the situation changes, execute the third contingency plan. And me? Suchin asked, you will depart with the Mo on. Your heart of the ocean is irreplaceable in terms of underwater environment and energy perception. Lyno looked at her.</p>
<p>But remember, your primary task is perception and early warning, not combat. If the situation gets out of control, the Moan will evacuate immediately. Understood. When will the operation take place? Sure, how asked. Tonight at midnight under the cover of darkness, the Mo Yuan will set sail ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Target: Secretly approach the broken reef area, area 3, and conduct covert observation. If any Freedom Wings vessels or suspicious activity are detected, Lyn Mo&#x27;s eyes turn slightly cold. Decide whether to monitor, interfere, or seize the area depending on the situation. The priority is to understand the enemy&#x27;s intentions and obtain intelligence, avoiding large-scale direct conflict as much as possible. But if conflict is unavoidable, he paused, then said with unwavering resolve, then let&#x27;s make sure we win.</p>
<p>Let Caesar know that the area around the Storm King&#x27;s territory is not his testing ground. Yes. With the order given, the entire Mo Yuan Pavilion spraying in action once more. As night deepened, the Rune Tower in the center of the island, illuminated by torches and crystal lamps, began to take shape with faint energy flows swirling around its tip. Meanwhile, in the eastern dock, the Mo Yuon, like a behemoth in the night, was silently completing its final preparations for departure.</p>
<p>Its dark hull almost blended into the darkness with only the fine runes on its surface, occasionally flashing with a barely perceptible blue light. Lyn Mo stood on the deck and did a final check on his equipment. He had a modified crossbow, an alloy dagger, close-fitting armor, and a small leather pouch at his waist containing several blue patterned crystal chips engraved with different simple runes. These were experimental pieces that Leewi had rushed to make. Their effectiveness was unknown, but they might come in handy.</p>
<p>On the lower deck, the elite team members silently and swiftly took their positions. Sherhow was giving a final tactical briefing in a low voice. Su Chian stood near the bow with her eyes closed, her long hair blowing in the sea breeze, her senses spreading out like mercury. Midnight is approaching. Lynn Emmo gazed at the dark sea horizon, which led to the unknown reef area and the turbulent sea that made all sailors tremble with fear.</p>
<p>&quot;Caesar, what are you trying to test and what have you obtained?&quot; He gripped the coal gunnel tightly. &quot;You&#x27;ll find out soon.&quot; &quot;Weigh anchor,&quot; he ordered in a low voice. raised the sails and set sail. Like an arrow released from a bow, the Mo Yuan cut through the calm night and headed towards the turbulent dark sea. The real storm perhaps had already quietly begun before it even reached the restless sea.</p>
<p>Chapter 42, Shadows of the Reef area. The Mo Yuan was like a pitch black knife, silently slicing through the thick darkness of the night to conceal their presence. The main sail was raised only onethird of its height, relying primarily on the well-trained sailors for power. Using long ores, the newly engraved sturdy runes on the hull lay dormant in the darkness. Their faint energy field only detectable upon close inspection like the breath of a sleeping behemoth.</p>
<p>Such Chan stood at the observation post on the left bow, her eyes slightly closed, her hands lightly touching the gunnel, her senses extended along the hull into the sea. Like countless invisible tentacles, scanning the changing hydraology and signs of life below. The water is getting shallower and a lot of jagged rocks are starting to appear on the seabed, she reported softly, her voice transmitted to the bridge through a makeshift megaphone. The currents are very turbulent. At least four different undercurrens are converging below.</p>
<p>There are very few small fish, but some crustations with neutral energy responses are attached to the rocks. About 800 m to the right, there is a large coral reef with a faint reflection on the surface above it, possibly a foamy area under the moonlight. Shh consulted the nautical chart and whispered, &quot;We&#x27;ve entered the outer perimeter of the broken reef area. Everyone remain silent and keep lights out. Lookouts use luminous lenses and watch for any unusual activity on the water and in the sky.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo stood in the shadows of the bridge, his sharp gaze sweeping across the dark reefs ahead, which resembled a crouching behemoth. The sea breeze carried a salty fishy smell mixed with a faint, sweet fishy odor unlike that of ordinary seaweed. Leewi squatted beside him, holding a modified mineral resonator in his hands. But at this moment, the instrument&#x27;s pointer was only trembling slightly, its direction unclear. The energy background is very complex, Leeway whispered.</p>
<p>The reef itself, certain special minerals, and even some deep sea plants could cause interference. But if wings of freedom is really testing some high energy items here, it should be able to tell if they get close. Dot. Time slipped away slowly in the oppressive silence. Yuan like a ghost cautiously navigated the labyrinth of reefs.</p>
<p>avoiding one hidden reef after another that lurked like monsters in the night. Occasionally, a roosting seabird would be startled, emitting a piercing cry that sent a shiver of tension through the crew. Around 3:00 a.m., Such Chanchan suddenly opened her eyes, her voice tense. Port side, 11:00 direction, about 1.5 km away. There are large metal objects underwater.</p>
<p>They are ships, more than one. They are mored, but the holes are emitting regular energy pulses, very weak, as if they are maintaining some kind of low power operation. It&#x27;s here. Everyone&#x27;s spirits lifted. Sure, how immediately signaled the helmsmen to adjust the course, and using the shadow of a huge reef, they slowly and stealthily moved towards the port side.</p>
<p>At the same time, the lookout raised a moninocular telescope with a dark filter and carefully observed in the direction Sue Chansion indicated. At least two medium-sized sailing ships have been spotted, their masts visible. The design resembles the Predator class modified vessels commonly used by Freedom Wings. There are no obvious lights, but there&#x27;s a faint reflection from the holes suggesting possible human activity, the lookout reported, barely suppressing his excitement. Can you see what they&#x27;re doing? Lyn Mo asked.</p>
<p>It was too far away and too dark to see clearly, but one of the boats seemed to have a crane or similar device extending out of the water, which looked more like it was launching or retrieving something and fishing. Lynn Mo pondered for a moment, then ordered, &quot;Continue to approach, maintaining cover from the reefs. Reduce the boat speed to the slowest possible.&quot; Suchan focus on sensing the area below that body of water, especially the direction the crane is pointing. like a black panther gliding close to the ground. The Mo Yuan slowly approached using the complex terrain of the reefs.</p>
<p>When the distance was less than a kilometer, even without binoculars, the dark outlines of the two ships could be vaguely seen. Like two larger reefs embedded in the inky sea. Sure enough, on the side of one of the ships, a thick crane-like shadow stretched towards the sea, its end disappearing into the water. Suchians brows furrowed deeper. her face appearing somewhat pale in the hazy moonlight.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s something underwater. It&#x27;s suspended or anchored to the seabed. The energy reaction is strange. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be purely mechanical or mineral. It&#x27;s more like a living thing, but the energy structure is very rigid with a strong sense of weaving like an aggregate forcibly combined from a large number of tiny life forms driven and bound by external energy.</p>
<p>Living organism aggregate driven by external energy. Linmo and Leewi exchanged a glance, both seeing the seriousness in each other&#x27;s eyes. This didn&#x27;t sound like an ordinary weapons test. Can you determine the size and shape of that thing? Then Montacet Such Chian strained to concentrate. Beads of sweat forming on her forehead.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very long, possibly exceeding 10 m with an irregular shape like a giant tangled vine or tentacles. The energy pulse is emanating from within it, synchronized with a device on the ship. Wait, something&#x27;s changing. The ship&#x27;s energy output is increasing. The underwater aggregate is starting to activate.</p>
<p>The energy reaction is escalating. Almost at the same time, Sue Chian finished speaking. Several powerful spotlights strictly shielded and shining only downwards, suddenly lit up on the wings of freedom ship in the distance. The beams of light pierced the darkness of the sea, focusing on the waters below the crane arm. By the brief glimpse of the light, the lookout and a few people on the bridge finally caught a glimpse of the terrifying underwater scene.</p>
<p>It was indeed an enormous, irregularly shaped dark brown to almost black mass, its surface covered in slime, reflecting a nauseating dim light. Under the bright light, it could be seen that it was composed of countless tentacle-like objects of varying thicknesses, resembling both plant and animal, twisted and intertwined, some with suckers or sharpbone spurs at their ends. At this moment, this mass was slowly writhing and expanding under the beam of light like a nightmare forcibly awakened from its slumber. What the hell is that? A young sailor couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim, his voice trembling. I danty know but it is definitely not a product of natural evolution.</p>
<p>The leeway s voice also became dry. The energy readings are soaring. Its internal structure is extremely unstable as if it s being forcibly catalyzed and controlled. Just then something seemed to happen on the wings of Liberty ship. A dull loud crash like metal breaking or something collapsing rang out exceptionally clear in the silent seen night despite its distance.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, the powerful spotlights began to shake violently and faint gasps and commotion came from a ship. It&#x27;s out of control. Su Chanchian gripped the gunnel tightly, her fingertips turning white. The energy binding of that underwater aggregate is rapidly weakening. Its activity is surging.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s becoming incredibly aggressive. As if to prove her words, the sea surface, shrouded in lights, suddenly exploded. A terrifying tentacle as thick as a bucket and covered with barbs and suckers burst out of the water and lashed the hull of the wings of Freedom ship next to it with a shrill sound. Crack. The sound of the wooden hull breaking could be faintly heard even from this distance.</p>
<p>The ship rocked violently and chaos erupted on board with shouts running and a clanging of metal all mixed together. Another ship attempted to attack the tentacles with ballisti, but even more tentacles swarmed out from underwater, frantically lashing and entangled the two vessels. One of the tentacles even coiled around a massive crane arm, bending it with a sickening metallic twisting sound. The experiment went out of control and backfired. Sure, how gasped.</p>
<p>What kind of monster did they create? Limo stared intently at the chaotic and terrifying waters, his mind racing. The wings of freedom were clearly testing a weapon combining biological and mechanical or energy technology, but they had failed. This thing was now indiscriminate in its attacks, friend or foe, and extremely aggressive. Boss, what do we do? Should we retreat in the chaos? Chin Duodo asked in a low voice through encrypted communication, his voice filled with tension. Retreat? Lynn Mo glanced at the two enemy ships struggling amidst the raging tentacles.</p>
<p>Then at the newly built Mo Yuan beneath his feet, its runes not yet fully tested. If this thing went completely out of control and lingered in this reef area, it would pose a significant threat to the Mo Yuan&#x27;s future course. Moreover, the energy core of that thing or the external device that controls it might still be on the ship, Leewi said urgently. If we can get our hands on it, it will be of immense value to our understanding of the wings of freedom&#x27;s technological direction and even to our reverse engineering. Risks and opportunities coexist.</p>
<p>Sure, how Linmo&#x27;s voice was calm and even prepare for battle. Mo you on circle around to the upwind side of that area of water and maintain a safe distance. Load all ballisti with armor-piercing heavy arrows and aim at the roots of those tentacles or the main body that aggregates underwater. Leeway record all energy change data. Suian continued to monitor that thing&#x27;s movements and energy weaknesses.</p>
<p>He paused, looking at the increasingly violent battlefield in the darkness. A sharp glint in his eyes. We ll wait until they re both exhausted. If an opportunity arises, he slowly clench his fist. We ll bring back that core or anything of value that we can get our hands on.</p>
<p>Dot. As for that monster, if Wings of Liberty can&#x27;t handle it, we&#x27;ll help it get completely dealt with. On the deck of the MOU on the soldiers silently gripped their weapons, and the crossbowmen adjusted their firing angles. A chilling killing intent quietly permeated the air. On the distant sea, the roars of monsters mingled with the sounds of ships breaking apart, staging a bloody accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the darkness, a new hunter had already silently taken its place. Chapter 43. Seizing the core. The sea surface in a reef area has become a living hell. The outofc control tentacle monsters displayed astonishing destructive power.</p>
<p>The first freedom wing medium-sized sailing ship attacked had a huge gash torn in its side. Sea water gushing in the whole listing noticeably and figures on board frantically fleeing, their cries for help as they launched lifeboats echoing in the night wind. The other ship was in slightly better shape, still stubbornly resisting with crossbows and incendiary arrows. But the tentacles seemed oblivious to pain, becoming even more ferocious after being wounded. Their massive, battering ram-like limbs, slamming repeatedly into the hole, sending splinters of wood flying.</p>
<p>Like a patient reef, the Mo Yuan lay dormant in the shadows 700 meters away. All the crossbows were calibrated. Heavy arrows were in their grooves, and bow strings were taught. The warriors on deck, clad in simple armor, held spears, harpoons, and modified crossbows, holding their breath in anticipation. The air was thick with the smells of the sea, burnt seafood, and a faint stench of blood.</p>
<p>Such Chians face pald further, and fine beads of sweat kept seeping from her forehead. The core of that thing is in the middle cabin of the first tilted ship. The energy fluctuations are the strongest, but extremely unstable, like a fireball that could explode at any moment. Some of the activity of the surrounding tentacles is powered by that core, but it&#x27;s mostly driven by the instinctive frenzy of its own biological tissues. She took a few quick breaths.</p>
<p>Its perception is strange. It mainly relies on energy disturbances and physical vibrations. Our ship has a runic energy field, although weak, but it&#x27;s from a different source. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have noticed us, or rather, it prioritizes attacking targets with more obvious energy disturbances and greater physical threats. A deformed product of biological and energy fusion.</p>
<p>Leeway stared intently at the resonator in his hand, its pointer swinging wildly, recording chaotic data. The core should be a device that forcibly drives and restrains it. Now, the restrain has failed and the biological instincts are backfiring, but the core is still providing energy, so it&#x27;s more violent than a pure biological entity. What madman came up with this? Lyn Mo&#x27;s gaze remained fixed on the battlefield. The listing ship was sinking faster, its stern already submerged.</p>
<p>Most of the survivors had transferred to small boats and were desperately paddling towards another ship. Meanwhile, the monster&#x27;s focus of attack was gradually shifting to the second ship, which was still putting up a fight. &quot;An opportunity is emerging.&quot; &quot;Sure, how?&quot; Lyno said in a low voice. &quot;First objective, seize the core. The Mo Yuan will slowly advance to its effective firing range of 400 m.</p>
<p>All Balliste awaiting my command will fire a volley at the rooe area where the monster&#x27;s tentacles connect to the ship&#x27;s hull, creating conditions for the assault team. The commando team sure how hell looked at him. I&#x27;ll lead the team. Six people. We&#x27;ll take a speedboat.</p>
<p>And while the crossbow fire creates chaos and distracts the monsters, quickly approach the sunken ship and infiltrate to seize the core. Lynn and Mo quickly selected several of the most agile team members skilled in close combat and underwater activities. Ziaoai Luong, you two come with me. Wear rubber suits and bring short blades, breaching tools, and waterproof bags. Such Chian, keep us informed of any changes in the core&#x27;s energy fluctuations and a monster&#x27;s shifting attention.</p>
<p>Leeway, prepare to receive and analyze the core. You may need to provide on-site guidance on how to safely dismantle it. It&#x27;s too dangerous. Su Chian instinctively grabbed Linmo&#x27;s arm. That monster is nearby.</p>
<p>The ship could capsize at any moment, and the situation inside the cabins is unknown because its attention and that of the remaining enemy are all on another ship. The interior of the sunken ship may be temporarily empty. This is the best window of opportunity. Lynn Emmo patted her hand, his gaze firm. We must get that core.</p>
<p>It may not only contain the wings of freedom as technological secrets, but it may also help us understand how to deal with similar threats. Danty, worry. We&#x27;ll l I&#x27;ll be quick in and quick out. Dot sure how knew he couldn&#x27;t dissuade him. So he said in a deep voice, &quot;I will direct the fire support.</p>
<p>You must act quickly. A salvo from the balliste can only buy us two or 3 minutes of safety at most.&quot; The action plan was quickly communicated. Lyn Mo and six commandos swiftly changed into tight fitting stabroof rubber suits and check their equipment. Two small shuttle-shaped boats, each capable of carrying only three or four people and moving extremely fast, were quietly lowered from the sides of the MOU on. By this time, the resistance of the second ship of the Wings of Liberty had reached its limit.</p>
<p>A thick tentacle wrapped around the main mast, and with a chilling creek, the mast slowly snapped and fell, crashing onto the deck and eliciting screams and flashes of light. The ship began to spin out of control. Now then, Emmo shouted. Mo Yuan advance. The listy ready.</p>
<p>The Mo Yuan&#x27;s main sail instantly reached full height and its oars swung in unison like a cheetah that had been poised for a long time suddenly leaping out of the shadows of the reef, cutting diagonally toward the battlefield. The bow cleaved through the seawater, and its speed increased dramatically. The sudden appearance of the third ship clearly caught both sides offguard. Amid the terrified screams of the wings of Liberty survivors, the main body of the tentacle monster, a massive mass of flesh over 15 meters in diameter, coiled near the wreckage seemed to hesitate for a moment, and the movements of its attacking tentacles slowed. 450 m away.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re in firing range. The lookout urgently reported. All Balliste aim at the base of the tentacles fire. Sure how roared. Boom boom boom boom.</p>
<p>The four heavy ballisti on the broadside of the MMO Yuan fired simultaneously. Speciallymade armor-piercing heavy arrows trailing a shrill whistle pierced the night sky and accurately struck the junctions of the second wings of Liberty ship and the main tentacles that were entangled around the wreck. A disgusting mixture of blood and slime exploded in the moonlight. The monster emitted a high-pitched inhuman screech. Its tentacles struck by heavy arrows convulsed violently, snapped or detached.</p>
<p>One arrow even pierced deep into the edge of the main tumor, causing it to writhe wildly. &quot;Now get in the water.&quot; Lin Mo waved his hand and jumped into the shuttle-shaped boat first. Xiao Tai Lu Foam and the other six followed closely behind. The two boats shot off like arrows, taking advantage of the momentum of the Mo Yuan ship&#x27;s forward charge and the chaotic ripples on the sea, silently and swiftly heading towards the slowly sinking wrecked enemy ship. Su Chanhan stood at the bow of the Mo Yuan ship, gripping the railing tightly with both hands.</p>
<p>Her mental power pushed to its limit. The monster&#x27;s attention has been drawn to the Mo Yuon. The main body is turning. Three tentacles are reaching towards us in a midsection of the sunken ship. The core energy fluctuations are intensifying and unstable.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an opening on the left side that we can enter, but there&#x27;s water inside and there might be remaining enemies. Her voice clearly reached Lin Mo&#x27;s ears through the simple sound transmitting conchk shell carried by the team, which contained a resonant crystal chip that could transmit clear speech over short distances. Roger that. Keep monitoring on. Lynn Emmo lowered his body as the small boat sped through the crests and troughs of the waves.</p>
<p>The icy sea water constantly splashing against his face. The short distance of two or 300 m seemed incredibly long at this moment. He could feel the vibrations of the MMO Yuons&#x27;s ballisti being reloaded and fired again behind him. And he could hear the monster&#x27;s angry roars and the loud thuds of its tentacles slapping the sea. 30 m, 20 m, 10 m.</p>
<p>The brereech is on the port side. Ziaoai pointed to a large jagged hole above the waterline of the sunken ship, torn open by tentacles. The small boat came to a stop just short of the slowly toppling hull of the sunken ship. Linmo gave a signal, and Ziao Tai and Luong were the first to throw out grappling hooks to secure the edge of the brereech. The group then scrambled up like monkeys and crawled into the dark interior of the ship.</p>
<p>Linmo was the last to enter, and he secured the boat&#x27;s mooring rope as well. The cabin was a mess, filled with a heavy stench of blood, burnt flesh, and an indescribable sweet rotten smell. The seawater had reached knee deep, and floating on it were broken planks, debris, and several mangled corpses. An emergency oil lamp still hung on the slanted bulkhead, casting a flickering, uneasy light. Turn right ahead, down to the next staircase.</p>
<p>The core energy source is on the next floor slightly to the right. Su Chians voice guided through the comp shell. Go. Linmo shorts sword in hand took the lead. Ziao Tai and Lu Phone guarded him on the left and right respectively while the other four team members kept watch on the rear.</p>
<p>The lower compartment was flooded almost waist deep. It appeared to be a laboratory or modification workshop scattered with bizarrely shaped glassware, metal supports, and biological tissue samples submerged in an unknown liquid. A nauseating sight. In the center of the compartment, a metal cabinet roughly the size of a wardrobe connected by thick cables appearing to be a mixture of some kind of highly conductive biological tendons and metal wires was half submerged. Several crystals emitting an unstable dark red glow were embedded in the cabinet surface, the source of the energy fluctuations.</p>
<p>Many pipes connected to the side of the cabinet, several of which were broken, gushing out a viscous, faintly glowing green liquid. That&#x27;s it. Leeway&#x27;s voice came from the comp shell, filled with excitement and tension. The dark red crystal is the energy source and control interface. The green liquid might be a bioactive maintainer.</p>
<p>First, disconnect the main energy connection. Be careful. There might be residual bioelectric shock or corrosiveness. Thai luo, guard the entrance. You two come with me.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo waited forward, avoiding the flowing green liquid and carefully examined the structure of the metal cabinet. Soon, he found several main cable connection points as well as an energy valve that appeared to be manually shut off. &quot;Such Chian, what&#x27;s the situation outside?&quot; he asked while preparing his tools. The monster&#x27;s main body has been temporarily forced back by sure burning arrows, but more tentacles are retracting, possibly indicating an anomaly in its core energy. You must hurry.</p>
<p>1 minute at most. 1 minute. Without hesitation, Linmo used speciallymade insulated pliers to quickly and precisely cut the three thickest main cables. Sparks crackled and a burnt smell rose. Then he found a manual valve and turned it to the closed position with all his might.</p>
<p>The dark red crystallin light on the metal cabinet surface quickly dimmed, leaving only a faint afterglow. Energy source cut off. Prepare to disassemble the core crystal and main control board. Lynn Mo ordered. Two team members immediately stepped forward and carefully pried open the protective panel of the metal cabinet with tools, revealing a more intricate internal structure.</p>
<p>One of them quickly collected a sample of the flowing green liquid using a speciallymade corrosion resistant container. The other communicated remotely with Leewi and under Leewi&#x27;s guidance carefully removed the three most important dark red crystals in a metal plate covered with fine textures, placing them into a speciallymade leadlined waterproof seal box. The whole process took no more than 40 seconds. Got it. Let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>Lynamo picked up the seal box and ran back the way he came. Just then, the entire shipwreck shuddered violently, accompanied by a chilling, scraping, and tearing sound that was almost within reach. A tentacle with sharp bone spikes at the end forcefully pierced through the bulkhead, diagonally above their heads. Muddy sea water carrying fragments of wood poured down. &quot;It spotted us.&quot; &quot;Run!&quot; Su Chanchians exclamation rang out from inside the conch shell.</p>
<p>&quot;Run!&quot; Lynn and Mo roared, carrying a box in one hand and wielding a knife to cut through the debris blocking their path. The group struggled with all their might, tumbling and crawling through the violently shaking, flooded cabin towards the breached exit. Behind them, more tentacles were frantically dismantling the ship&#x27;s cabins with terrifying hissing and collapsing sounds following closely behind. A race against time. It all comes down to those final 10 m.</p>
<p>Chapter 44. fire and rebirth. Bone spiky tentacles grazed Lin Moe&#x27;s back. The fishy stench they stirred, making his hair stand on end. Splinters of wood and murky seaater pelted down on him.</p>
<p>Exit. Jump. Lynn and Mo roared. Not even having time to turn around. Using the momentum of the tilting of the cabin, he and his box rushed towards the opening in front of him that led in a faint moonlight and water light.</p>
<p>Ziaoai leaped out almost simultaneously and in midair he didn&#x27;t forget to slap Lu Fong who was a step slower hard on the back with the back of his knife to help him speed up. The other four team members tumbled and scrambled out in a single file narrowly escaping just before the tentacles completely destroyed the bulkhead behind them. Thump thump. The group plunged into the icy sea like dumplings being dropped into a pot. Linmo held his breath the moment he entered the water, gripping the sealed box tightly with one hand and kicking his legs hard, trying to float towards the direction of the small boat, he remembered.</p>
<p>He could hear the dull thuds of the underwater collapse and the immense suction from the tentacles churning the water. Left front, the small boat is over there. Hurry, Luong surfaced, spitting out seaater and shouted urgently while paddling vigorously. Two shuttle-shaped boats were just a dozen meters away. The two team members responsible for the retrieval were paddling frantically to stabilize the boats and reaching out to help.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo grabbed one of the outstretched hands, used the leverage to flip onto the boat, and immediately stuff the seal box into a specially designed locking slot inside the boat. Quick, everyone on board, row toward the on. The team members boarded the boat hastily but quickly, filling it to capacity in an instant. The orars paddled wildly, leaving rapid ripples on the water as they desperately fled towards the Moan, which was still battling the monster. Lin Montak, behind you.</p>
<p>Three tentacles are coming. They&#x27;re very fast. Suchanians tearful scream came from the conch shell with a roar of the Mo Yuan&#x27;s ballisty firing and a monster&#x27;s howl in the background. Lyn Mo turned around and saw under the moonlight three terrifying tentacles thicker than buckets and covered with suckers and bone spurs bursting through the water like sea serpents emerging from their caves chasing after the two small boats at an astonishing speed. The distance was rapidly closing no more than 100 meters.</p>
<p>Sure how intercept and fire shoot the pursuers. Lynn Mo shouted at the comp shell. On the bridge of the Mo Yuan, Sherhow&#x27;s forehead veins bulged as he stared intently at the approaching tentacles. Starbborist number one and three aim at the midsection of the pursuing tentacles. Fire.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Two crossbow bolts, each with a small gunpowder canister attached to its stern. A homemade explosive device that Leeway had painstakingly reconstructed using available materials whistled out. However, due to the small boat&#x27;s high-speed movement and the rough seas, the boat&#x27;s impact points were off.</p>
<p>One exploded a few meters in front of a tentacle, creating a high column of water and slightly slowing its speed. The other missed completely, exploding on the sea surface further away. Not enough. They&#x27;re too fast, the rower cried out in despair as the shadows drew ever closer. The menacing suckers and bone spikes at the tips of the tentacles were clearly visible in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo&#x27;s mind raced. The small boat was already at its maximum speed, and the MO Yuan&#x27;s fire support was limited by the angle and the risk of friendly fire, making it unlikely to be effective. Just then, the tip of the nearest tentacle was raised high, about to slam down. Left, turn left. Follow my directions.</p>
<p>Su Chian&#x27;s voice rang out again, carrying a strange penetrating power. Trust me, Lin Mo shouted without hesitation. Straight to left. Keep up. The two small boats suddenly veered sharply to the left, tracing a sharp arc.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, the raised tentacle crashed down with tremendous force, narrowly missing the edge of the boat&#x27;s starboard side, and the resulting giant wave nearly capsized the boat. 30° to the right front. Accelerate. Suchanians command followed immediately. The small boat changed direction again.</p>
<p>Another tentacle swept in from the side, but missed again. Its underwater perception has blind spots and it is slow to react to sudden irregular changes in direction. The energy disturbances are also concentrated directly in front. Sue Chanchian explained urgently. Her heart of the ocean was operating an unprecedented intensity accurately predicting the attack trajectory of each tentacle and the weak gaps in the energy flow.</p>
<p>Now charge straight towards the Mo Yuon quickly. Without any hesitation, the two small boats poured their last bit of strength into their propellers and sped toward the Moon, which had already turned around and was using its broadside ballisti to clear a path for them. Behind them, the toy tentacles danced wildly, relentlessly pursuing, but each seemingly certain strike was evaded by the small boat at the last moment with an incredibly minute angle. It was like dancing on a knife&#x27;s edge, weaving through the fingertips of death. 80 m, 50 m, 30 m.</p>
<p>The massive black shadow of the Mo Yuan was right in front of us with rope nets and rope ladders thrown from the ship&#x27;s side, clearly visible. Get back up. Sure, how roared. The last 10 m. One of the thickest tentacles seemed to be completely enraged.</p>
<p>It stopped slapping and instead lunged forward like a giant python, opening its sucker-like mouth with sharp teeth at the front and biting at the last small boat. Watch out, everyone on the lead boat, where Linmo was was terrified. At the critical moment, next to the only unfired heavy crossbow on the starboard side of the Moan, a ballista with red eyes fired the ballista by instinct without having time to aim carefully. The heavy arrow transformed into a black line, not shooting towards the tentacles, but precisely piercing deep into the open, relatively fragile sucker-like mouth. The slime, mixed with unidentified tissue fragments, exploded.</p>
<p>The tentacle let out an extremely sharp screech, then suddenly convulsed and contracted, its movements instantly freezing. It&#x27;s that moment of stillness. Two small boats narrowly made their way to the side of the Mo Yuan ship. Countless arms reached down and pulling and tugging quickly dragged the exhausted and pale-faced Linmo and the others onto the deck. The two small boats were then swiftly secured with ropes.</p>
<p>Set sail full speed. Get out of this area. Lynn Mo had barely stood up on the deck and hadn&#x27;t even had time to catch his breath before he gave the order. With all its main sails raised and ores swung in unison, the ship shuttered slightly and began to accelerate, heading towards the reef Maze it had come from. Behind it, the tentacle monster, having lost its core energy support and suffered successive injuries, seemed to be at its last gasp.</p>
<p>Although it was still angrily waving its remaining tentacles, its pursuit speed had clearly slowed down. In the end, it could only let out a low, gradually weakening whale in the direction the Mo Yuan had gone before slowly sinking into the sea, polluted by blood and wreckage. On the deck, still reeling from the shock, Lynn Mo leaned against the ship&#x27;s railing, breathing heavily. Cold sea water dripped down his latex suit. Such an ran over, her face even paler than his, her eyes red- rimmed.</p>
<p>She wanted to say something but could only grip his wet arm tightly, her fingers trembling slightly. Well done, Chanchian. Lynn Mos voice was horsearo as he gave her a tired but sincere smile. Without you, we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to come back. Su Chanchian shook her head, tears finally falling, which she quickly wiped away.</p>
<p>Sherhal walked over and patted Linn Mos shoulder hard. He didn&#x27;t say anything, but the fear and relief in his eyes were clearly visible. Leewi eyes hopped over like a monkey, his eyes fixed on the sealed box at Linmo&#x27;s feet. Want to touch it, but not daring to. Core? How&#x27;s the core? Is it sealed properly? What about those green liquid samples? Quick, let me see them.</p>
<p>I need to analyze them immediately. What are those lunatics at Wings of Freedom doing? Lynn Mo kicked the box and said to Lee way, &quot;When we get back to the island, you&#x27;ll have your chance to see this. Now have someone check the wounded, take stock of the losses and strengthen security. One of the wings of Freedom&#x27;s ships escaped. It&#x27;s damaged, but there might still be survivors.</p>
<p>Also, although that monster seems to be finished, it&#x27;s not completely dead yet. This area of the sea is temporarily designated as a restricted zone. He walked to the top of the ship&#x27;s deck and looked back at the battlefield that was gradually being swallowed by darkness and the shadows of the reefs. The moonlight was cold and the sea seemed to have returned to calm with only some floating debris and oil slicks as evidence of the fierce battle that had just taken place. This time he won.</p>
<p>He obtained a crucial item, severely damaged the enemy&#x27;s secret weapon, and while his side was alarmed, they were not in serious danger. But Caesar&#x27;s madness and ruthlessness exceeded his expectations. That monster combining biological and energy resources was clearly not something that could be created in a short time. Behind the wings of Liberty, there was probably more to it than just plunder. He touched the conch shell at his waist and Shinwood&#x27;s anxious inquiry came through it.</p>
<p>Boss, how are things over there? There were some scattered messages on the regional channel just now saying that there was a huge explosion and commotion in the southeast reef area. Was that you guys? Do you need any support? Lineo calmed his breathing and replied, &quot;It was us. We encountered the wings of freedom testing ground and a conflict occurred. The situation has been resolved and we are returning. The core objective has been achieved.</p>
<p>Notify the island to increase vigilance, especially at sea. We will be back soon.&quot; He put down the conch shell, feeling the steady progress of the Mo Yuan ship as it cut through the waves. He looked at his companions on the deck who were tired but had determined eyes and then at the warship beneath his feet, a vessel that embodied everyone&#x27;s hard work and had performed well in its first combat mission. The title of King of Storms signifies not only glory but also the courage to confront the most turbulent undercurrents and fight the most ferocious beasts. And this is a path he is destined to walk with these people all the way.</p>
<p>Speed up and return. He gave the orders softly, his gaze fixed on the direction of Mauuan Pavilion Island. Back home, the rune tower should be almost finished. New challenges and opportunities await there. Chapter 45 tower.</p>
<p>The deepest darkness before dawn was cleaved open by the bow of the Mo Yuan ship. The island&#x27;s outline gradually became clear in the faint morning light, and the lights on the watchtowers resembled guiding stars on the way home. After a night of life or death struggle, the exhausted people finally relaxed a little when they saw their home. As soon as the boat docked, Chi and Duod Duo and his men came to greet them. Seeing that everyone was soaking wet, injured, and exhausted, but with bright eyes, he swallowed back the question he was about to ask and just patted Linmo&#x27;s arm hard.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re back. The tower that engineer Lee kept talking about is finished. It was just completed an hour ago. Line looked up. In the newly built inner fortress area at the center of the island, a tower about five stories high with a stone in which structure in an ancient yet strangely rhythmic design stood quietly.</p>
<p>The surface of the tower was faintly visible with fine patterns outlined by blue variegated crystal powder, emitting a very faint soft blue white glow in the darkness before dawn. Completely different from the lights in other parts of the island, carrying a calm and mysterious atmosphere. Arrange for the wounded to go to the medical station first and have the others rest in shifts. We can&#x27;t let our guard down. Sure, how you take charge.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo quickly gave the orders, then picked up the seal box and said to Leewi, who was waiting anxiously, and Sue Chanchian, who was barely holding on, &quot;Let&#x27;s go and take a look at our tower.&quot; Although Su Chanchians face was still pale, her eyes regained their clarity, and she silently followed. The interior of the primary rune tower appears more spacious than the exterior. The first floor is a vast hall with a complex circular array of runes about 3 m in diameter engraved in the center of the floor. It is currently emitting a faint glow as the energy of the tower flows. There is a peculiar sense of cleanliness in the air as if dust and odors have been filtered out, leaving only a faint scent similar to the mixture of minerals and pine wood after rain.</p>
<p>Upon entering, Leewayi took a deep wrapped breath, then rushed to the central array and pulled out various rudimentary instruments to begin testing. Stable, extremely stable. The free energy in the environment. He insisted on using this term rather than magical elements is naturally absorbed, purified, and then slowly released by the runes on the tower&#x27;s base, forming a very gentle and orderly energy field. Performing rune inscription and energy material processing here will increase the success rate by at least 20%.</p>
<p>No, 30%. He gestured excitedly, then pointed to several recesses and platforms surrounding the hall walls. Look there. According to the blueprints, those are the interfaces for the detection bases and interference nodes. Although we don&#x27;t have the corresponding auxiliary component blueprints yet, the basic functions should already be activated.</p>
<p>Give a try. Lynn Mo walked to a recessed area with fine energy conducting patterns connecting it to the central array along its edge. After a moment&#x27;s thought, he placed a dark red crystal fragment, which had lost its activity and been removed from the core of the sunken ship into the recess. As soon as the fragment was placed, the circular array of runes in the center of the ground glowed slightly. Then a faint light screen appeared out of thin air above the slot where the fragment had been placed.</p>
<p>Twisted intermittent lines and dots of light flickered on the screen like a faulty touchcreen. Is this an analysis of the residual energy structure? Lewi leaned closer, pushed up his glasses, and tried to make out the details. Although it&#x27;s incomplete, you can see that the energy channels inside this crystal are constructed in a very crude way, full of forced embedding and overriding traces. This is definitely not a product of natural formation or fine design. It&#x27;s more like using powerful external energy to forcibly burn the energy affinity properties of some biological tissue into the mineral matrix.</p>
<p>Barbaric, inefficient, but it can indeed create a powerful energy source in the short term. Can we reverse engineer their technical approach or find their weaknesses? Linmo asked. It will take time and we ll need more samples and control data. But with this tower, the analysis efficiency will be much higher, Leewi said confidently, then looked at the seal box in Lin Mo&#x27;s hand, his eyes burning with excitement. So, the real core Linmo placed the box next to the central array, but didn&#x27;t open it immediately.</p>
<p>Chian, how are you feeling? Is the tower&#x27;s energy field affecting you? Such Chian had been quietly sensing the energy, and upon hearing this, she nodded gently. It&#x27;s very comfortable. It&#x27;s like soaking in a spring with a suitable temperature, and the fatigue from my previous overexertion has eased a lot. This tower seems to gently nourish and regulate abilities like the heart of the ocean, which lean towards perception and affinity. Moreover, she closed her eyes, then opened them after a moment, pointing in a certain direction outside the tower.</p>
<p>I can feel that within a radius of about 200 m centered on the tower, the energy flow has become much clearer and more orderly. If there were any external powerful or disharmonious energy intruding, I should be able to detect it much earlier than before. Enhanced range perception and energy environment management. This is practically a strategic level function. Linmo was certain.</p>
<p>The value of this tower far exceeded his expectations. leeway. The analysis of the core and the green liquid is the top priority. But to ensure safety, it must be done inside the tower with proper isolation measures. I need to know first how this thing was made and what the key materials and technological barriers are.</p>
<p>Second, its energy output characteristics, control methods, and weaknesses. Third, whether it is possible to conduct limited reverse engineering or defensive countermeasures that Lyno said seriously. If wings of freedom can create one, they might create a second and a third. We must be prepared. Understood.</p>
<p>Leave it to me. Leewi patted his chest confidently, then added somewhat sheepishly. However, it might require some additional materials to make the analytical tools and secure containers. Get the money to approve the necessary approvals and prioritize our supply, Lyno said without hesitation. Knowledge is power and we absolutely cannot skimp on investment in this area.</p>
<p>At this moment, Sherh Howal, having finished dealing with matters on the shore, also came in, his face showing a hint of semity. We just received a report from the outer patrol boats that unidentified vessels have been spotted sailing about 30 nautical miles to our southeast and northwest. Their formation is loose, but they are vaguely monitoring us. They may be remnants of the wings of freedom or other hyenas that have caught a whiff of blood. Increase patrol density and coverage and deploy more reconnaissance boats.</p>
<p>Maintain deterrence, but refrain from unprovoked attacks as long as the other side doesn&#x27;t enter our designated 12 nautical mile perimeter. Lyno said in a deep voice, &quot;We need time to digest this gain, strengthen our defenses, and especially to figure out the full functionality of that tower.&quot; Also, Chindwa, the fat man who had been following behind without saying a word, immediately stepped forward. Boss, a brief statement was released in the name of King of Storms and Mo Yuan Pavilion on regional and national channels. The content is roughly as follows. During a routine patrol, our forces encountered an attack by an unidentified biological weapon which has been eliminated.</p>
<p>This weapon is suspected to be man-made and extremely dangerous. We urge all survivors to be vigilant and cautious about unknown sea areas and anomalous energy signals. At the same time, Mo Yuan Pavilion is willing to provide basic energy anomaly detection, consulting services, and some defensive supplies at a reasonable price. Chindwood was eyes lit up. Brilliant.</p>
<p>It not only clears us of suspicion of instigating the dispute and characterizes the incident as eliminating a public threat, but also subtly alludes to wings of freedom. And we can also do some business on the side, enhancing our reputation and influence. I&#x27;ll go draft the proposal right away. Be careful with your wording so as not to give people any ammunition to attack you, Lyno added. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m good at playing with words.</p>
<p>Chandu duo ran off happily. Sure how watched Shandwood was retreating figure shook his head and smiled then said seriously to Linmo after this experience. The brothers have more confidence in the Mo Yuan ship but the actual combat also exposed some problems with coordination and equipment. I plan to organize several targeted drills in the next few days. In addition, we might be able to study the tissue samples of the monster brought back from the reef area to see if we can find an effective way to deal with similar creatures.</p>
<p>Okay, you decide on the drill plan. The sample research will be handled by Leewei, but it must be conducted inside the rune tower under strict protection. Lynn Mo agreed. The group discussed some more details until dawn broke and the morning light shone through the tower windows, casting dappled shadows on the rune inscribed ground. Lynn Emmo walked to the window, gazing at the awakening island.</p>
<p>Smoke curled from chimneys. Patrols moved nimly, and the workshops echoed with the clanging of metal. In the distance on the sea, the Mo Yuan was replenishing supplies and undergoing maintenance. Behind him, the newly erected rune tower quietly radiated an invisible power, protecting and strengthening everything here. From a desolate six square meter island to a base now boasting warships, rune towers, and numerous allies, the road ahead is long.</p>
<p>The enemies remain powerful, and the mysteries are still unsolved. But with each step forward, the foundation grows stronger. He turned around and saw Su Chian leaning against the wall, fast asleep, a peaceful expression on her pale face. Leewi was carefully and intently preparing to open the sealed box. Sherhow, meanwhile, had already begun writing and drawing on his portable wooden board, planning the training schedule.</p>
<p>This is his territory, his companions, the force he will protect and lead forward. Go and rest everyone, Leeway. Don&#x27;t stay up too long either. The samples won&#x27;t run away. Lynn Mos voice echoed inside the tower.</p>
<p>Sure, how arrange the shifts once everyone has recovered. We have more important things to do. He gazed out the window at the vast sea, his eyes fixed on a distance. Caesar&#x27;s revenge won&#x27;t be long in coming, and the secrets of the restless sea still await explorers. But before that, he wanted to make the island, the tower, stronger and more solid.</p>
<p>The king of storms must not only be able to stir up storms, but also be able to create a windless harbor for his people. Chapter 46. Crystallization undercurrens. The seal box was opened next to the circular array in the center of the rune tower. There was no expected energy burst or unusual noise.</p>
<p>The three dark red core crystals and the intricately patterned control panel lay quietly on a specially designed shockabsorbing pad. Their surfaces dull, only occasionally emitting a faint ember-like red glow when energy flowed through the tower. In a smaller container nearby, the viscous, faintly glowing green liquid was sealed. Wearing a makeshift protective suit constructed from multiple layers of adhesive tape and coors cloth and goggles that covered most of his face. Leewwayi carefully transferred a core crystal to a stone analysis table engraved with energy conducting patterns.</p>
<p>The analysis table was connected to the basic detection array of the rune tower. Suchanian sat on the steps a little further away. Her complexion was better than yesterday but still pale. She closed her eyes and focused her mind, gently covering the area with her senses, not forcibly probing, but more like listening. The inside of the crystal is very quiet, but the forcibly embedded biological network is still there, only it has lost its energy supply like a dried up riverbed.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a painful and angry residual feeling in those green liquids. There are similar residual life activities, but more chaotic, full of the desire for growth and mutation, which has also been forcibly suppressed. Lynmo stood to the side, arms crossed, brows slightly furrowed. Listening to Sue Chanchian&#x27;s description, and combining it with Leewi&#x27;s upcoming technical analysis, he tried to piece together the full picture of Wings of Freedom Technology. Initiate basic scanning.</p>
<p>Leeway took a deep breath and activated the analysis platform. Energy from within the tower flowed in along the patterns, and a soft white light shone on the surface of the stone platform, enveloping the dark red crystal. The light screen in front reappeared, this time much more stable and clear than when using the fragments, and began to slowly outline the complex three-dimensional structure inside the crystal. Look here. Leeway pointed to a twisted main channel and countless branching veins on the light screen, an energy channel network.</p>
<p>The construction method is extremely crude, full of traces of violent drilling and subsequent repairs. The main channel forcibly penetrates the original stable structure of the crystal. And these branching veins are like some kind of energy sensitive biological nerve core that has been branded into it with high temperature and high energy. This will lead to a fragile crystal structure, low energy transmission efficiency, and extreme instability. He switched between several scanning modes and different colored areas appeared on screen.</p>
<p>The red areas are the inert energy matrix of the crystal itself. The dark blue is the embedded biological network residue and these bright green spots are the catalytic energy residue forcibly injected to activate and drive the network. This energy leeway magnify the image. His expression growing increasingly grave has strong induced mutation and force proliferation characteristics. It highly matches the energy signature of those green liquids.</p>
<p>He suddenly looked at the can of green liquid. Then at Lynn Mo, I understand the operating principle of this system is probably using this special crystal as an energy source and control core, forcibly driving and binding one or more special marine biological tissues with high activity and strong mutation capabilities. That green liquid is the culture medium and controller that maintains and stimulates the activity of the biological tissues. The crystal issues commands catalyzing the transmission of energy through the biological network, stimulating the biological tissues to grow rapidly, mutate, and attack according to a preset form such as tentacles. However, due to the dual brutality of the technology and materials, the instincts of the biological tissues are extremely prone to backlash.</p>
<p>And once the control cracks or the energy supply is overloaded, it will turn into the kind of outofcrol monster we saw last night. Lynn Emmo interjected his eyes. I see. Where did Caesar get this technology? And these special crystals and culture medium. The crystal itself is somewhat like a storage crystal after high mutation and energy pollution, but the processing method is unheard of.</p>
<p>The composition of the culture medium is more complex, and I need time to do more refined separation analysis. As for the source of the technology, Leeway pushed up his slipped glasses. This crude and cost nothing approach to fusion doesn&#x27;t seem like a normal scientific research product, but rather like a shortcut in the development of war weapons or a remnant of some crazy testing ground. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, Lynn Emmo, immediately thought of the mysterious mentor. But the mentor style leaned more towards knowledge and ruins.</p>
<p>This kind of destruction and chaos didn&#x27;t seem like his work. Could there be another force behind the wings of Liberty? At this moment, the team member in charge of intelligence gathering hurriedly entered the tower and handed Linmo a wooden board with a message recorded on it. Combined information from the patrol team and surrounding intelligence points. The remaining ships of the Wings of Freedom have withdrawn to the depths of their controlled area and their surface activity has decreased. However, several small and medium-sized forces that have traded with us have revealed that the Wings of Freedom are secretly purchasing stable energy crystals, high strength bioids, and active tissue samples from ancient sea beasts at high prices.</p>
<p>The purchasing effort is substantial with almost no regard for price. Furthermore, an informant at the Black Coral Market in the Northeast reported that 3 days ago, an unmarked medium-sized galley secretly arrived near the main island of the Wings of Freedom. unloaded some seal cargo boxes. The boxes were very heavy and was under extremely heavy guard. The secret cargo ship for acquiring materials.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo tapped his fingers lightly on the wooden plank. Caesar was making up for his losses and might even have acquired new technical support, preparing for something even bigger. Could the secret card ship be the source of that technology and raw materials? Any news for Dragon Soul? He asked. Captain Xiao Ji Gang sent an encrypted communication confirming that they were also monitoring the unusual movements of the Wings of Freedom and that one of their reconnaissance teams had detected a faint energy signature similar to the restless sea in the waters further north. But the location was erratic.</p>
<p>They warned us that Caesar might be planning a large-scale operation, possibly targeting us or perhaps to acquire some kind of resource located in dangerous waters. Lynn Emmo walked to the tower window, gazing at the distant sea. Caesar, having suffered such a heavy loss, would never let it go. Replenishing materials and gaining new support were all for an even more devastating attack next time. The objective was either to completely destroy the Moan Pavilion to eliminate future threats or to acquire resources sufficient to turn the tide or create even more terrifying weapons likely related to the restless sea.</p>
<p>leeway. Analyze the core and the liquid. Identify the energy frequency characteristics, control signal patterns, and most likely weaknesses of this fusion technology, especially the biological tissue portion. See if there are any common inhibitors or interference methods. Lyno turned and ordered, &quot;Sure, how expedite the comprehensive overhaul and reinforcement of the MOUN, especially its underwater defenses, organized the workshop to try mass-producing the silent ripple simplified rune pieces that Leeway developed before.</p>
<p>Although the effective range is small, it might be useful in critical moments. In addition, select a more elite underwater combat team and conduct targeted training. Yes. Where&#x27;s Chian? Duo Duo. Manager.</p>
<p>Chiian is in a trade zone chatting with some merchants who have come from afar and trying to gather trade intelligence about the area around the wings of Liberty&#x27;s controlled territory. The team member replied. Let him continue. Meanwhile, through a trading network secretly spread the word that our Moyuan pavilion is also interested in stable energy crystals and ancient sea beast research data, offering favorable prices, but requiring clear provenence. see if we can disrupt Caesar&#x27;s acquisition plans or uncover that secret supply line.</p>
<p>Clear? The group obeyed and left. Only Lin Mo, Su Chanchian, and Leewi, who was completely absorbed in the analysis, remained inside the tower. Such Chanchian walked to Lin Mo&#x27;s side and whispered, &quot;You&#x27;re very worried about the next attack. Caesar is like a wounded mad dog. Next time he pounces, he&#x27;ll be even fiercer and more ruthless that Lyno didn&#x27;t he deny it.</p>
<p>Moreover, I suspect someone is handing him a stick. We must become stronger than him faster. This tower and the Mo Yuan ship are our strength that Su Chian looked at the slowly rotating rune array in the center. I can feel that the power of the tower is gradually merging with the island. Perhaps I can try to combine the perception of the heart of the ocean with the tower s detection function to some extent.</p>
<p>I d need to control it. I could just map my feelings into the tower s energy field. Maybe they can expand the warning range or more clearly identify the types of threats. Dot. Lynmo&#x27;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>You can give it a try, but you must be careful and proceed gradually. Your body hasn&#x27;t fully recovered yet. Mm. Su Chanchian nodded, a faint smile appearing on her pale face. We won&#x27;t lose.</p>
<p>This is the home we built bit by bit. Yes, home. Lin Mo looked around at the tower that embodied everyone&#x27;s hard work and hopes and gazed out the window at the vibrant island. From surviving on a deserted island to standing alongside powerful nations, the road was full of thorns. But every step was taken firmly.</p>
<p>If Caesar wants war, then let them fight. The storm king&#x27;s territory was never defended by retreating. He wanted all those who coveted it to understand who truly controlled the waves in this sea. He gently squeezed Sue Chanchian&#x27;s hand. Let&#x27;s go check on the progress of the Mo Yuan ship repairs.</p>
<p>Then we need to plan how to prepare a surprise gift for the potential guesta. The sea breeze waves through the tower windows, carrying the clean scent unique to the newly built Rune Tower. Undercurrens surged in the distance while the rock was silently growing harder. Chapter 47 Tide News. Leeway spent two whole days in the rune tower.</p>
<p>When he emerged, his eyes were sunken and his beard was unckempt, but his eyes burned with a flame that was a mixture of fear and excitement. He clutched a stack of densely written BART paper and rushed directly to Lynn Mo, who was inspecting the underwater reinforcement progress of the Mo Yuan ship in the dock. Major discovery, boss. That green liquid isn&#x27;t just a simple culture medium. Leeway&#x27;s voice was from excitement and lack of sleep.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a mixture of inducing pherommones and energy catalyzing enzymes. Moreover, it has clear group command characteristics. Lyn Mo waved for the surrounding craftsman to continue working, then pulled Leeway to a sheltered corner. Explain yourself clearly. I separated the liquid components and analyzed its energy fluctuation patterns using the tower s detection array that leeway quickly flipped through the bar papering to a series of distorted waveforms and scribbled annotations.</p>
<p>Look at this band. This is random stimulation. It s encoded signal. Although crude, it mimics the pherommones of some deep sea creatures gathering and attack under specific circumstances. Wings of freedomi just trying to create a single monster.</p>
<p>They might want to use this liquid in conjunction with that mutated crystal to influence or even control natural sea beasts within a certain range. Lyn Mo&#x27;s eyes narrowed sharply. You mean what they tested last night might just be a prototype of a controller or a signal tower? The real goal is to trigger a controlled or at least directional tide of sea monsters. Very likely, Leeway nodded vigorously. Those biological networks embedded in the crystals have an extremely strong resonant response to this type of pheromone.</p>
<p>Assuming they deploy multiple such crystal cores like beacons in a specific sea area and then release large amounts of this modulated liquid. Theoretically, they could attract and stimulate the surrounding sea monsters to become extremely aggressive and roughly guide them in the direction they want. Last night s out of control monster might just be a fail product driven by a single overloaded core. But if they solve the stability problem and create multiple that would be a catastrophe, a man-made swarm of sea monsters whose direction and target could be roughly controlled if Caesar were to use such a weapon against his enemies. Linmo immediately thought of Sue Chanchan.</p>
<p>Her island was relatively isolated. And if Caesar used such insidious methods, her island would likely become one of his primary targets both to strike at his close allies in the Mo Yuan Pavilion and to test the effectiveness of his weapons. Can the effective range and duration of this pheromone be analyzed? Is there any way to interfere with or block it? Then Montac presset. The range depends on the energy intensity of the core crystal and the degree of liquid diffusion. There are no specific data, but I speculate that if properly arranged, it is possible to affect sea monsters within a range of several nautical miles.</p>
<p>As for the duration, the active ingredients in a liquid will naturally degrade, but the crystal can continuously emit enhanced signals, which I estimate can last for several hours to a whole day. Dot leeway pushed up his glasses. In terms of interference theory, if we find the precise frequency of the pherommones and cover it with reverse or chaotic energy fluctuations, it is possible to disrupt its commands. But this requires very precise equipment and energy sources. We cannot do that at present.</p>
<p>As for shielding, it would require a barrier that can completely isolate energy and pheromone penetration or a sufficiently large distance. Lynn Mohart sank. The technological gap and the disadvantage of insufficient preparation time were particularly evident at this moment. The Wings of Freedom had likely been researching this dangerous weapon in the shadows for some time while they had only just begun analyzing the captured samples. Just then, Su Chanchians slightly hurried voice came through the small resonant conch shell that Lin Mo carried his waist.</p>
<p>Linmo, where are you? I feel something is wrong. Linmo and Leewi exchanged a glance and immediately headed towards the rune tower. Inside the tower, Su Chanchan stood beside the central array, her face even paler than yesterday, almost translucent. She gently pressed her hands against the edge of the array, closed her eyes, and her body trembled slightly. Chian, what&#x27;s wrong? Lynn Emo quickly stepped forward.</p>
<p>The energy is restless in a far off place. The Sue Changen&#x27;s voice carried a hint of barely perceptible panic. It s not the restless sea but another direction northeast. It s a very chaotic and violent reaction of life energy which is converging and intensifying. Moreover, there are subtle forceful fluctuations mixed in that make me very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It feels similar to the feeling I got from that green liquid, but it s more dispersed and more subtle. Dot northeast. That&#x27;s roughly the location of Sue Chian&#x27;s Island, and it&#x27;s also the sea area where the dragon soul had previously indicated the discovery of a faint energy reaction similar to the restless sea. Can you determine the distance and scale? Linu asked in a deep voice. Su Chanchan tried to concentrate, cold sweat beating on her forehead.</p>
<p>The distance is very far, beyond our regular patrol range, probably two or 300 nautical miles away. The scale is not small. Many creatures are reacting of varying sizes, but all are becoming aggressive. It&#x27;s like before a storm. The fish are restless, but now all the predators on the seabed are stirring.</p>
<p>Leewi&#x27;s face turned pale. The pherommones are spreading and taking effect. Caesar may already be testing it. In that direction? Your island is in that direction? Lynn Emmo asked Su Chanchan. Such Chian opened her eyes, her gaze filled with worry, but even more so with determination.</p>
<p>My island has basic defenses, and I made arrangements before I left. But if it really is a man-made sea monster tide, they probably can&#x27;t stop it on their own. Besides, there are other survivor islands in that area. Lynn Mo&#x27;s mind raced. Caesar&#x27;s choice to test in the relatively remote northeastern sea far from his controlled territory allowed him to avoid harming himself, strike a potential opponents, including Su Chian, and gather real world combat data.</p>
<p>A win-win situation. Ruthless enough. What to do now? Rescue Su Chian&#x27;s island? The distance is too great. Even at full speed, it would take the Mo Yuan ship nearly a day to reach it. By the time it arrives, it might be too late.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Mo Yuan pavilion itself might also be at risk. Caesar could easily use a faint attack. Sure, how Linmo called out to the conch shell here. Sure&#x27;s voice came immediately. Island on level one alert.</p>
<p>Inspect all defense facilities, double the patrols, and recall all surrounding ships and personnel. informed Shien Duo Duo to suspend all non-essential trade activities and take inventory of stockpiles, especially weapons and medicines. Then Mo spoke rapidly. In addition, prepare the supplies needed for the Mo Yuan&#x27;s emergency voyage based on maximum range and combat reserves and complete this within 2 hours. Understood.</p>
<p>Shh replied without hesitation. Lynmo then looked at Leewi. Leewi, you stay here. Continue the analysis and try to find the key frequency characteristics of the pherommones. Even if it&#x27;s just an approximation, prepare some experimental rune devices that might be used for interference.</p>
<p>A small range is fine. At the same time, monitor the detection feedback from the rune tower. Report immediately if there are any signs of abnormal energy or biological aggregation. Okay, I&#x27;ll do my best. Lea Fatikali.</p>
<p>Finally, Lyno looked at Su Chanchian, but before he could speak, Su Chanchian had already grabbed his wrist, her fingertips icy yet firm. I want to go with you. My abilities in underwater perception and communication with gentle creatures are probably what we need most. Besides, that&#x27;s my home, and I have to go back.&quot; Lin Mo looked into her eyes, and there was no pleading in them, only an unwavering determination. He knew he couldn&#x27;t stop her, nor should he.</p>
<p>Okay, but you must promise me that you will follow orders and never take any risks. Dot. Lynn Mo squeezed her hand in return. Go and prepare. Take the necessary items and medicines.</p>
<p>We ll leave in an hour. Dot. Su Chanchian breathed a sigh of relief, nodded vigorously, and turned to leave quickly. Linmo walked to the tower window and looked at the gloomy sky where the sea and sky met in the northeast. The clouds seemed to press even lower.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s revenge began in this unexpected and more insidious way. A man-made tide of sea monsters was brewing in the distant northeastern seas. He didn&#x27;t know if he could make it in time, stop it, or even protect himself and Sue Chian&#x27;s island from the raging beast tide. But there are some things that even knowing the danger must be done. This was not only for Sue Chian, but also to understand the true power of Caesar&#x27;s new trump card, for the innocent people who might be affected, and even more so for the bottom line in his heart that could not be trampled upon.</p>
<p>How could the king of storms sit idly by while storms ravaged the seas he cares about? He took a deep breath, turned around, and walked firmly toward the dock. The Mo Yuan is about to set sail once more, heading into the unknown, raging seas. This time, however, they may face thousands upon thousands of ocean eyes stained crimson with madness. Chapter 48. Rushing across the raging sea.</p>
<p>Like a heavy arrow released from a bow. The MO Yuan crashed through the rising waves and sped off at full speed toward the northeast. The main sail, billowing in the wind like the chest of a monstrous beast, was fully engaged. The extended orars on both sides were in use, and the strongest sailors chosen for their skillful maneuvering roared low calls as they rode with all their might. The seawater cleaved at the bow turned into white foam, turnurning to both sides and leaving a long churning contrail at the stern.</p>
<p>The sky was overcast, letting clouds hung low, and the air was thick with a salty dampness and a faint, unsettling fishy odor. Standing at top the ship&#x27;s upper deck, Lin Mo held a moninocular telescope, his gaze sweeping across the sea and horizon. Aside from the increasingly turbulent waves and a few seabirds flying low, nothing seemed to miss, but the heavy premonition in his heart. Along with the occasional brief reports from Leeway transmitted from the rune tower via the conchk shell at his waist, the energy field of the tower base is stable. No large-scale abnormal energy has been detected approaching the island, and the environmental free energy reading in the northeast direction continues to rise slowly, consistent with the precursor to a large-scale life form gathering, made him dare not relax for a moment.</p>
<p>Su Chian, wrapped in a thick waterproof cloak, leaned against the base of the main mast. Her face was still pale, but her eyes were focused. Her hands were clased together in front of her, her knuckles slightly white from the force. Her senses, like the most sophisticated sonar, continuously spread forward and into the deep sea. There are more and more life signs, she suddenly spoke, her voice not loud, but clearly reaching Lynn Mos ears amidst the wind, waves, and tides.</p>
<p>They re not on our route, but in a vast sea further east and north. Like countless restless points of light, originally scattered against the dark background, they&#x27;re now being attracted and awakened by some invisible force slowly moving in roughly the same direction. I can feel that chaotic anger and hunger deepening. D. Can you identify the main species and their approximate speed of movement? Lyno asked, putting down his binoculars.</p>
<p>Such Chian closed her eyes and concentrated for a moment. The species are very diverse. The large ones have energy outlines similar to hammerhead sharks and tiger sharks, but are more chaotic. They&#x27;re more medium-sized ones like schools of barracudas, large barracudas, and some kind of armored fastoving arthropods. Their overall speed is not fast, as if they are gathering and brewing.</p>
<p>But once they explode, the impact speed will be terrifying. The most troublesome thing is that there are some big guys in the deep water that are rising to the surface. Their energy reaction is very strong and their forms are hard to predict. Sharks, large predatory fish, crustaceans, and even possibly deep sea monsters lured ashore mos brow furrowed even more. If this was truly a man-made beast tide, its destructive power would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>ordinary wooden sailboats and even moderately fortified islands would be utterly vulnerable to such an impact. How far are we from there? And how far are we from Shallow Island? At our current speed and direction, it will probably take another 7 or 8 hours of sailing to reach the edge of that turbulent sea area. My island is further in. Sue Changians voice trembled slightly. I hope they are prepared.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo walked over and gently pressed her slightly trembling shoulder. We&#x27;ll catch up. Your islanders aren&#x27;t unprepared either. Besides, Caesar couldn&#x27;t have made such a big commotion just to attack an island. His real goal might be testing, eliminating competitors in that area.</p>
<p>Or perhaps there&#x27;s something he needs there. We still have time to deal with it. Such Chian felt the warmth and strength coming from her shoulder, took a deep breath, and nodded. Sherhow walked up from the lower deck. His face wet from the sea breeze and splashing water.</p>
<p>The ship is in good condition and the rowers are rotating smoothly. Weapons have been checked. All ballisty are loaded half heavy arrows and half incendiary arrows. Following the ideas Lee gave us before he left, we rush to make a batch of sound blasting tubes which are made by stuffing gunpowder and scrap iron into sealed bamboo tubes, lighting the fuse, and throwing them out. They can cause a loud bang and shrapnel damage at close range, which might be useful against dense schools of fish.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve also added an extra layer to the underwater protective net, but whether it can withstand the impact of large sea monsters is hard to say. Do your best, Lin Mo said in a deep voice. Notify everyone to take the time to rest and eat. The real battle may begin around nightfall. The order was given, and the atmosphere on the ship grew even more tense, but no one panicked.</p>
<p>Those who could board the Mo on to participate in this expedition were all elites who had experienced many battles and trials. They silently checked their weapons, organized their equipment, chewed on their hard rations, and dried meat, occasionally exchanging a few words and low voices, their eyes filled with wolf-like vigilance and ferocity. Time passed amidst the waves and the sound of the wind. The sky grew increasingly gloomy, and a few cold raindrops began to fall. Visibility on the sea was decreasing.</p>
<p>An EMO Yuan seemed to be sailing through the mouth of a gray behemoth. Around 300 p.m., Sue Chansen, who had been sensing with her eyes closed, suddenly opened them and said urgently about 15 nautical miles ahead to the left, &quot;There&#x27;s a strong energy conflict. It&#x27;s not a natural beast tide. It&#x27;s a battle. There are ships, more than one.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re fighting sea beasts.&quot; Lynn and Mo and Shirhow immediately rushed to the port side and raised their binoculars. Through the rain and lowhanging clouds, they could vaguely see scattered flashes of fire where the sea met the sky in the distance, as well as almost inaudible explosions torn apart by the wind. &quot;Can you identify which faction it belongs to?&quot; Linmo asked. Su Chian tried hard to discern. The energy in the battle zone is too chaotic.</p>
<p>But one energy fluctuation carries a very positive and orderly feeling. Somewhat like a dragon soul. Dragon soul. They&#x27;re in the sea area too and are fighting with sea monsters. Slow down.</p>
<p>Move towards the combat zone. Stay concealed and maintain a safe distance for observation. Linmo ordered. If it were the dragon soul, perhaps they could obtain more intelligence and maybe even join forces. The Mo Yuan slowed down and taking advantage of the increasingly heavy rain and the thin fog at sea, carefully headed towards the direction of the flickering fire.</p>
<p>As the distance closed, the scene through the telescope gradually became clearer. Three medium-sized sailing ships arranged in a triangular formation were engaged in fierce combat with a horde of sea monsters several times their size. The ships were sturdy, their tactics wellcoordinated, and although the flags fluttering on their mass were wet with rain, the iconic dragon emblem of Dragon Soul was still clearly visible. The seab beasts attacking them were a diverse array. Hammerhead sharks over 5 m long, frantically ramming the hall.</p>
<p>schools of seawolf fish leaping out of the water trying to jump onto the deck and several giant sea scorpion-like creatures with shiny black shells wielding huge pincers constantly trying to climb the ship side. The Dragon Soul ships fought back tenaciously with crossbows, incendiary arrows and oil tanks mounted on the ship side. Many sea beast corpses and remains floated on the sea, but the horde seemed endless with each wave of attacks higher than the last. They&#x27;re surrounded. The beast horde is organized, taking turns attacking to wear down their defenses.</p>
<p>Sure, how with his extensive experience, immediately saw the key point. Look there. Such an suddenly pointed to a relatively calm sea surface behind the horde of beasts. There&#x27;s something underwater. The energy reaction is very concentrated, very deliberate.</p>
<p>It feels a lot like the residue of the green liquid, but it&#x27;s more concealed, like it&#x27;s issuing continuous commands. Lynn Mo looked in the direction she pointed, and the seawater, there seemed to be a darker color with a faint, unnatural dark green fluoresence flowing underwater. It&#x27;s a beacon or a control node. Then Mo understood instantly. The wings of freedom hadn&#x27;t revealed themselves directly, but instead deployed a control node here to guide the horde to attack the dragon soul ship that happened to be operating in this area.</p>
<p>This served two purposes. Testing weapon effectiveness and striking at their competitors. Boss, what do we do? Should we help or not? Sure. How asked helping Mint directly confronting this strange controlled beast tide, exposing themselves, which was extremely risky. Not helping meant that Dragon Souls three ships were likely to be completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo hesitated for only a moment. The Dragon Soul is a potential ally and a representative of Order. To stand by and watch them perish would be morally reprehensible and detrimental to long-term strategy. More importantly, if they don&#x27;t probe the strengths and weaknesses of this controlled beast tide here, they will only be more passive when the tide attacks sue Chian&#x27;s island or themselves. Help, Lynmo said decisively, but not by charging straight in.</p>
<p>Sure, how command the Mo Yuan to circle around to the flank and rear of the beast horde. Aim at the underwater control node area that Chansion pointed out and use all the crossbows to concentrate firepower and give it a good beating. Use armor-piercing heavy arrows and explosive arrows. Blow it down. Understood.</p>
<p>A fierce glint flashed in Shows eyes, and he immediately rushed to the command post. Chan, focus all your attention on sensing the energy changes and the beast hordes reactions around the node. Xiaoai Lu Foam, take a team and get ready. If the beast horde goes out of control and scatters after the node is destroyed, some might escape and attack us. You&#x27;re responsible for clearing out any sea beasts that get close.</p>
<p>The order was relayed swiftly. Like an assassin in the shadows, the Mo Yuan began to silently trace a wide ark, bypassing the fierce main battle and stealthily heading towards the eerily fluorescent sea area behind the beast horde. Everyone&#x27;s heart was in their throat. Whether this can break the deadlock depends on this one strike. Chapter 49.</p>
<p>Breaking the impass. Gathering dragon souls. The Mo Yuan was like a poison dagger, silently cutting into the pulse behind the surging beast tide. The rain and sea fog provided excellent cover. The ship&#x27;s lights had long been extinguished with only the occasional faint glow of runes emanating from the hull, strictly controlled to a minimum.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breath. The only sounds were the rhythmic slicing of ores cutting through the water and a mournful whistling of the sea breeze against the sails. Suchan gripped the damp, cold gunnel tightly. All her senses focused on the water that glowed with an eerie dark green light. Below the energy pulsed rhythmically and coldly, a stark contrast to the violent chaotic life fluctuations of the surrounding sea beasts like a stubborn discordant metronome in a chaotic symphony.</p>
<p>Right below about 15 m deep, the energy core is stable. But is there a protective bofield around it? No. But it&#x27;s a large number of small energy organisms gathered and enveloping it like a living armor. Sue Changen&#x27;s voice was extremely low reaching Linmo and sure how s ears through the comp shell. The interference is huge.</p>
<p>My senses can&#x27;t penetrate it and I can t see the specific shape but the characteristics of the energy signal are highly homologous to those green liquids. And the source of the control signal s dispersion is right here. Position locked. Sure. House&#x27;s eyes flashed and he growled into the loudspeakers of the crossbow positions below.</p>
<p>Crossbows 1 through 4, all equipped with Lee&#x27;s speciallymade armor-piercing explosive arrows. Target 300 m directly in front, 15 m below the water surface. Concentrated area coverage. On my command, Yuan slowly adjusted its angle and a four heavy ballisti on its sides silently rose in the darkness for calibration. The gunners placed arrows with oversized gunpowder canisters attached to their sterns and specially hardened arrow heads into the slides, their fingers gripping the triggers.</p>
<p>Now, Sherhow suddenly waved his hand. Release. Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
<p>Boom. from muffled thuds. Almost in unison, the crossbow strings vibrated violently and four speciallymade heavy arrows tore through the rain, tracing almost straight paths through the air before plunging into the dark green water. It entered the water without making a sound. Time seemed to freeze for a second.</p>
<p>Immediately, boom, boom, boom, boom. A muffled, massive explosion came from underwater, and the sea surface suddenly bulged upwards, transforming into four enormous splashes of water mixed with fire, slime, and shattered tissue. The powerful shock wave caused the Mo Yuan ship 300 m away to shake violently, and the people on the deck were thrown about. The dark green fluoresence of that body of water instantly became chaotic and flickering before rapidly fading away. it.</p>
<p>The energy core fluctuations are rapidly decreasing. Control signal interrupted. Suchan shouted immediately, her voice filled with surprise and exhaustion. Almost simultaneously, the swarm of sea monsters that were frantically besieging the dragon soul fleet ahead broke into obvious disarray. The predators who had been advancing and retreating in an orderly fashion suddenly halted their movements.</p>
<p>Their rhythm of attack disrupted. The hammerhead sharks stopped their relentless ramming of the ship and began to wander aimlessly. The school of sea wolves lost their unified target for leaping, and some even began to bite each other. The giant sea scorpions also stopped climbing, waving their pincers, seemingly somewhat bewildered. The node has been destroyed.</p>
<p>The horde has lost its unified command. Sherhow clenched his fist excitedly. &quot;Don&#x27;t be too happy yet,&quot; Lin Emo stared intently ahead. The command was interrupted, but their bestial instincts remain. Moreover, they have been provoked and are within reach.</p>
<p>Beware of counterattacks and chaotic clashes. All personnel prepared to engage the enemy. Sure enough, after a brief period of chaos, the sea beasts, having lost their unified objective, turned their anger and primal hunting instincts toward the nearest targets, including the Moan, which had just caused such a huge commotion. Some of the sea beasts turned around and charged toward the MOU on. Although their formation was scattered, their numbers were still considerable.</p>
<p>Fire freely. Prioritize taking out medium-sized targets there close by. Conserve heavy arrows. Shh commanded loudly, remaining calm under pressure. The warriors on the Mo Yuan immediately sprang into action.</p>
<p>The ballisti were replaced with ordinary heavy arrows, and they fired short bursts at the charging swarm of sea bream and scattered hammerhead sharks. Archers and spearmen on the ship&#x27;s sides also took their positions, using arrows and harpoons to repel any small sea creatures attempting to approach. Ziaoai and Lu Foong, leading a team of skilled melee fighters, armed with long-handled sickles and machetes, guarded key positions on the ship sides, ready to deal with any stragglers that jumped aboard. The battle instantly intensified. Despite its superior equipment, the Mo Yuan was under immense pressure from the onslaught of numerous frenzied sea monsters attacking from multiple directions.</p>
<p>A hammerhead shark slammed into the underwater port side with a dull thud, causing the ship to tilt noticeably. Several seawolf fish seize the opportunity to leap, their sharp teeth biting into the hole plating, only to be pierced through by the warriors guarding the area with their spears. on the right. Those two giant scorpions are coming. The lookout screamed.</p>
<p>Two giant dark-shelled sea scorpions abandoned the dragon soul ship, slithering along with their segmented limbs and astonishing speed towards the right side of the MOU on their massive pincers raised high, gleaming coldly. Starboard ballista, aim at the joint. Fire. Sure. How roared.</p>
<p>The two crossbows on the right hastily aimed and fired. One arrow missed, ricocheting off the sea scorpion&#x27;s thick carropase. The other, however, luckily struck the weak joint where one of the sea scorpion&#x27;s pincers connected to its body. The arrow head embedding itself deeply. This the injured sea scorpion let out a sharp hiss and its movements became frantic.</p>
<p>The other intact sea scorpion rushed over and its pincers clamped down hard on the ship&#x27;s side. Just at this critical moment, a sharp whooshing sound suddenly came from the side and behind. Several heavy crossbow bolts burning with intense flames shot towards the dragon&#x27;s soul fleet. They struck precisely at the junction of the charging sea scorpion&#x27;s head and breastplate. With several loud bangs, the flames and impact instantly charred and shattered the sea scorpion&#x27;s head and breastplate, abruptly halting it charge as it crashed into the sea.</p>
<p>Its dragon soul support. Ziaoai exclaimed in surprise. The three Dragon Soul ships quickly regained their footing after the beast horde fell into chaos, and one of them decisively spun off to support the MON. The warriors on board coordinated perfectly, firing crossbows and arrows in unison to help relieve the pressure on the MON. With the addition of fresh troops, the pressure on the MON was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The two ships fought side by side, providing cover for each other and repelling and dispersing the scattered hordes of beasts that charged forward. Lacking unified command and attack from both sides, these lured sea beasts finally began to retreat, some diving into the deep sea and others scattering away from the ships. About half an hour later, the sea finally returned to relative calm, leaving only floating corpses, wreckage, and lingering smoke and the smell of blood. The medium-sized sailboat that Dragon Soul had sent as support slowly approached. Standing at the bow was a tall, middle-aged man wearing simple leather armor, but with a tough and capable demeanor was Xiao Ji Gang.</p>
<p>Lord Lyno, I&#x27;ve long admired your name, King of Storms. You truly live up to your reputation. Xiao Ji Gangs booming voice echoed from a distance. Thank you for your assistance. If it weren&#x27;t for your precise strike on that strange control node, our three ships would probably be doomed here today.</p>
<p>Lynmo walked to the ship side and cuped his hands in response. Captain Xiao, you&#x27;re too kind. The dragon soul is maintaining order in the sea, and we just happen to be there, so naturally, we couldn&#x27;t sit idly by. Besides, this controlled beast tide threatens everyone. The two ships drew closer and lower their gang planks.</p>
<p>Xiao Gi Gang accompanied by two deputies boarded the MOU on the two sides briefly exchanged information. One of our reconnaissance teams was tracking a faint energy anomaly we had previously detected in this area when we inadvertently fell into an ambush and were surrounded by this strange beast tide. We suspect it s the work of the wings of freedom, but weary struggling to find evidence and a way to break the spell. Dhiao Gi Gang said gravely, UV found a key as soon as you arrived. I admire your insight and decisiveness.</p>
<p>We had a bit of a grudge against them before, but we were lucky enough to get some of their experimental samples and did some analysis that Lyno didn&#x27;t he go into details. Instead, steer the conversation to the key point. Captain Xiao, is there any connection between the energy anomaly you are tracking and the control signals for this beast tide? Xiao Gang nodded. Our instruments have limited precision, but they are generally pointing in the same direction deeper into the northeast. We suspect that the wings of freedom may have discovered something there or using some kind of natural energy field there to amplify and spread their control signals.</p>
<p>This beast hide is very likely just a stress test. Linmo and Su Chanchian exchange a glance, both seeing the worry in each other&#x27;s eyes. If Caesar had truly found a natural signal amplifier, the scale and range of the beast tides he could create would far exceed imagination. Captain Xiao, what your plans next, Linmo asked. We must report the situation and findings here as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the same time, continue to monitor the energy anomalies in the Northeast. The threat from the wings of freedom has escalated to a new level and we must unite more forces to deal with it. Ziao Ji Gang looked at Linmo, his tone sincere. Lord Linmo, we are aware of the strength and stance of the Mo Yuan pavilion. Would you be willing to establish a closer cooperative relationship with the dragon soul? At least in this sea area, we need to fight side by side in dealing with the wings of freedom and this strange beast tide.</p>
<p>Lyno pondered for a moment. Deep cooperation with Dragon Soul had both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage was gaining official intelligence and support and sharing the burden. The disadvantage was the potential to be drawn into larger conflicts and actions would be somewhat restricted. However, the threat from wings of freedom was imminent, so cooperation would be mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Yes. Linmo extended his hand. We can cooperate closely on intelligence sharing, joint defense and containment of freedom wings and its dangerous technologies. We can discuss the specific details with our subordinates later. Dot.</p>
<p>Xiao Ji Gang gripped Lin Mo&#x27;s hand tightly. Good. That&#x27;s great. After exchanging some more details and agreeing to keep communication open, Xiao Ji Gang led his men back to his ship, preparing to leave the dangerous waters and return to base to report. On board the Mo Yuan, the crew began cleaning the deck, treating the lightly wounded, and inspecting the damage to the hull.</p>
<p>Linmo looked northeast where Sue Chanchan&#x27;s home was located, and also in the direction of the unknown energy anomaly and the possible signal amplifier. &quot;Rest for an hour, replenish supplies, and then continue on your way,&quot; he ordered. &quot;Our destination remains the same, but this time we must be more careful.&quot; Caesar&#x27;s shadow looms wider and more menacing than imagined, and the road ahead remains shrouded in mist. Chapter 50. Lonely Island Fire.</p>
<p>After separating from the dragon soul fleet, the Mo Yuan continued sailing northeast. Night had fallen. The rain had stopped, but the dark clouds lingered, completely obscuring the moonlight. The sea was pitch black, with only the spray from the waves breaking at the bow, gleaming faintly. Most of the crew took the opportunity to rest while only the lookout and the sailors on watch remained at their posts, vigilantly observing the near absolute darkness around them.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo, wide awake, sat in the ship&#x27;s deck, repeatedly examining the nautical chart by the dim light of a lantern powered by fragments of energy storing crystals. The coordinates of Su Chian&#x27;s island were clearly marked on it. It would take approximately four more hours to reach them at full speed from their current location. More than 3 hours have passed since we encountered the dragon soul and destroyed the control node. Sure house said in a low voice as he walked over.</p>
<p>If Caesar had other arrangements or backup plans in that sea area, they should have been activated by now. Miss Sue Island is probably under pressure to Lynn. Emmon nodded, his fingers tapping unconsciously on the table. This was exactly what he was worried about. Caesar couldn&#x27;t have made such a big fuss just to trap a few Dragon Soul ships.</p>
<p>Testing weapons, striking potential adversaries, or even concealing his true purpose exploring or utilizing the energy anomaly in the northeast were all possibilities. And Such Chanchan&#x27;s Island, located relatively far forward and closely connected to the Mo Yuan Pavilion, was undoubtedly an ideal target for attack or testing. Speed up. Tell the rowers to hang in there a little longer and then everyone will take turns resting once we reach our destination. Lin Mo said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Understood. Sure how turned to relay the order. Lin Emo stepped outside the cabin. The cold night wind invigorating him. He approached the bow of the ship where Su Chian still stood wrapped in a cloak like a silent statue facing northeast.</p>
<p>Chian, take a rest. Your senses are exhausted. Linmo draped a dry, thick blanket over her shoulders. Su Chanchian shook her head gently, her voice somewhat unsteady. I&#x27;m fine.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m listening to the sounds carried by the wind, the messages coming from the sea. My island is still here. I can feel that familiar faint call, the life imprint left by the island&#x27;s inhabitants over a long period of time, but it&#x27;s very anxious, very tense, like a string stretched to its limit. She turned to look at Lin Mo, her eyes shining brightly in the darkness. Linmo, will we make it? We definitely will.</p>
<p>Dot. Lin Mo grasped her cold hand. Besides, weary not unprepared. Your islanders have defenses. And Weevi brought the mo you on.</p>
<p>Dot. Su Chian felt the firm strength emanating from his hand, and the anxiety in her heart subsided slightly. She turned her attention back to the distance, trying her best to capture every subtle fluctuation. Time passed slowly and oppressively. Around 3:00 a.m., the Mo Yuan entered a sea area completely different from before.</p>
<p>The seaater was colder, the currents were turbulent, and the unsettling fishy smell in the air reappeared, even stronger than before. Scattered dead fish belly up and some broken unidentifiable fragments of biological tissue began to appear on the surface. We entered the edge of the affected area. Sue Chantians voice tightened. The marine life around us that showed signs of life has either fled or become unusually agitated.</p>
<p>Be careful underwater. As if to confirm her words, a muffled thud came from the bottom of the ship as if something had crashed into it. Immediately afterward, not far ahead on the port side, the sea suddenly exploded and a strange fish over 4 m long with a mouth full of fangs leaped out of the water, writhing wildly before crashing back down. It&#x27;s a mad shark. They usually only live in the deep sea, an old sailor exclaimed.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve been attracted here, too. Slow down. Be careful to avoid obstacles. All personnel, prepare for battle. Sure house roar rang out on the deck.</p>
<p>VMO Yuan slowed down, cautiously navigating the sea, fraught with unknown dangers. Occasionally, enraged or lost sea monsters would emerge from the darkness to launch attacks. Though small in scale, their frequency was high, severely slowing the ship&#x27;s speed. &quot;This won&#x27;t do. We won&#x27;t make it before dawn.&quot; &quot;Sure,&quot; House said anxiously.</p>
<p>Lyno looked at the nautical chart, then at the sky. The straight line distance to Sue Chan&#x27;s island wasn&#x27;t far, but at their current speed. Use that, Lynn. Emo decided even though we&#x27;ll expose us, we can&#x27;t worry about that now. Sure, how was taken a back then nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>Understood. He immediately ordered several crew members to quickly carry out several long tarpollen covered object from the lower deck and secure them to specific supports on both sides of the ship&#x27;s hull. Uncovering the tarpollen revealed several thick modified copper pipes with simple energy conducting patterns engraved inside connected to a box at the stern containing an energy storage crystal and a simple rune array. This is an experimental product created by Lee Wayi based on the principles of the silent ripple rune amplified and oriented a directional sonic wave disperser. Theoretically, it can emit powerful sound waves of a specific frequency to drive away small to medium-sized marine life within a certain range.</p>
<p>However, it is extremely unstable, consumes a huge amount of energy, and the sound waves may also attract the attention of larger predators, making it one of his trunk cards that he will only use as a last resort. Activate target the fan-shaped area directly ahead. Sure. How ordered. The crew member in charge of operation activated the device and the light from the energy storage crystal dimmed momentarily while the rune array humped.</p>
<p>Several copper pipes began to emit a low, increasingly loud hum. The frequency changing rapidly until it finally became a sharp highfrequency noise that was almost inaudible to the human ear, yet caused the seawater to vibrate violently and made everyone on board feel suffocated and irritable. Buzz. The sea ahead began to tremble violently as if it were boiling. The mad sharks and other small and medium-sized frenzied sea creatures that tried to approach seemed to be whipped hard by an invisible whip, rolling and struggling in pain before turning around and fleeing in panic, quickly clearing a relatively clean area of water ahead.</p>
<p>It works, but it will only last a few minutes. Full speed ahead. Sure, how roared. The main sail of the Mo Yuan was raised to full height again, and the long oars were rode with all their might. Like a giant beast breaking free of its shackles.</p>
<p>It charged out along the cleared path. The speed suddenly increased. In Sue Chanchan&#x27;s perception, the call of her home became clearer and clearer, but the anxiety and tension also became stronger, even mixed with a trace of despair. Her heart clenched suddenly about half an hour later, just as the directional sonic deflector stopped working due to energy depletion and the surrounding sea creatures showed signs of gathering again. A flickering light suddenly appeared in the darkness ahead.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t starlight, wasn&#x27;t phosphoresence, it was real orange, red flame light, and not just in one place. Then more flashes of fire appeared, vaguely outlining the shape of an island. On the island&#x27;s beach and near the shore, figures moved about and shouts of battle, the clanging of metal, the vibration of bow strings and the roars of sea monsters mingled and drifted on the wind. &quot;It&#x27;s my island. They&#x27;re under attack!&quot; Su Chanchian cried out, her body trembling with excitement and fear.</p>
<p>Lin Mo raised his binoculars on the edge of the medium-sized island. Makeshift wooden fences and obstacles were broken and burning in several places. Dozens of islanders were using the remaining fortifications, employing spears, harpoons, bows, and arrows, and rudimentary catapults to fight a bloody battle against numerous sea monsters attempting to storm the beach. On the sea, the wreckage of several small damaged boats could be seen burning and sinking. The attacking sea monsters were of mixed species and although their numbers were not as large as those that had besieged the dragon soul fleet for an island with limited defenses it was already a catastrophic disaster.</p>
<p>It s a scattered beast tide led by the wings of freedom. They rew wearing down the island as defenses sure how deduced emo you on full speed ahead allisti aim at the densest part of the beast horde crashing onto the beach and fire hard. Use incendiary arrows. Linmo&#x27;s eyes flashed with cold light, his voice as icy as ice. Xiaoai Lu Fong, take two teams and get ready.</p>
<p>Once we suppress the beast horde, immediately board small boats to land and provide support. Remember, we are just a passing unsuspecting merchant caravan. I am Mr. J. Understand? Understood? Everyone responded in unison without slowing down in the slightest.</p>
<p>The Mo Yuan, like a black vengeful messenger, charged straight toward the island&#x27;s fiery coastline. The soldiers on board quickly took their positions. The ballisti were adjusted and the arrows were knocked. As the distance rapidly closed, the people fighting on the island also spotted the suddenly appearing, menacing ship and cried out in surprise and uncertainty. Lin Mo stood at the very front of the ship&#x27;s deck, raised his hand, and looked at the tiny figures fighting bloody battles against the sea beasts in the fire light, and at the isolated island that was teetering on the brink of collapse under the onslaught of the beast tide.</p>
<p>His fingers suddenly swung down. Fire. The next moment, the side of the Mo Yuon erupted in furious flames and howls. Burning arrows like a rain of meteors tore through the darkness and slammed into the densest herd of beasts on the beach. The rescue operation began and the anonymous identity of Mr.</p>
<p>J would once again become a mysterious and powerful cloak in Linmo&#x27;s hands. Standing behind him, Su Chanchian looked at the familiar island and the blood soaked homeland, then at Lin Mo&#x27;s unwavering back, her eyes instantly welling with tears. He came. He really came. Chapter 51.</p>
<p>Strangers offering aid. The burning heavy arrows like a rain of divine punishment slammed into the densest herd of beasts on the beach. The explosive flames instantly engulfed several of the leading crazy sharks while the rolling flames and scattering shrapnel tore apart and ignited the surrounding small and medium-sized sea beasts. The sudden and terrifying attack momentarily halted the frenzied horde, and many sea beasts instinctively retreated, creating an opening in their attack. Is that ship helping us? Reinforcements.</p>
<p>Reinforcements have arrived. Don&#x27;t stand there now. Plug the gap. Spearman advance. On the beach, the exhausted and blood soaked islanders were initially stunned, then erupted in shouts of triumph.</p>
<p>A robust middle-aged man who appeared to be their leader brandished a Nick machete and gave orders with a horse voice. The survivors mustered their last courage and used spears, harpoons, and burning bundles of grass to drive back the sea monsters that had been frightened away by the explosion and were still lingering. Instead of docking directly, the Mo Yuan skillfully traversed a semiircle on the sea about a 100 meters from a beach, continuously suppressing the densest area of the beast herd with its broadside. The roar of the crossbows and the exploding of the incendiary arrows became the most reassuring symphony at that moment. Small boats prepare, landing team go, sure how commanded from the deck.</p>
<p>Two slightly larger landing craft, each capable of holding more than 10 people, were lowered. Xiao Tai and Lu Fong leading 20 fully armed elites from the Mayuan Pavilion, most of whose faces were covered by makeshift masks or camouflage paint, quickly boarded the craft and rode vigorously toward the gap in the beach that had just been cleared by crossbows. Lynn Mo remained standing in the shadows of the ship&#x27;s deck, observing the landing through binoculars. His attire was different from usual. He wore an inconspicuous dark waterproof cloak over his face and a cloth covering half his mouth and nose, revealing only his calm eyes.</p>
<p>Suchen, however, was forced to remain in her cabin to rest while simultaneously avoiding being seen by any islanders who might recognize her. The landing craft surged onto the beach, and Ziao Tai and his men, like tigers unleashed, immediately joined the battle. Their equipment was clearly far superior, their training exceptional, and their teamwork impeccable. They quickly stabilized and widened the gap, dividing, driving away, and killing the remaining sea monsters. The ballisti on the Moan also ceized fire in time to avoid friendly fire.</p>
<p>With the addition of this fresh force, the balance of the battle quickly shifted. About 15 minutes later, the last wave of dozens of sea monsters that had stormed the beach were completely defeated, and the survivors fled back into the sea, leaving behind a mess of corpses and burning remains on the beach. The crisis was temporarily averted. On the beach, the islanders who had survived the ordeal sat or lay down, panting heavily. Many of them gazed at the silent and imposing black ship anchored near the shore and at the mysterious, powerful reinforcements that had suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>their eyes filled with gratitude, awe, and doubt. The middle-aged leader, panting heavily, approached Xiao Tai, who had just stepped onto the beach, supported by several young men. Xiao Tai, also figning nonulence, deliberately lowered his voice. It&#x27;s all right. We&#x27;re a passing caravan.</p>
<p>We saw them in trouble and just want to lend a hand. How many casualties do you have? Thank you so much, all you righteous heroes, for your help. The middle-aged leader named Chinhai was one of the temporary administrators elected after Su Chancham left. He clased his hands in gratitude. The casualties were considerable.</p>
<p>More than a dozen brothers died, and many more were wounded. But if you hadn&#x27;t arrived in time, our island would probably be gone. Please, our benefactors, come aboard and rest. Let&#x27;s do our part as hosts. Ziaoai waved his hand.</p>
<p>No need. We have sufficient supplies, so we&#x27;ll rest on the ship. You all hurry up and treat the wounded, extinguish the remaining fires, clean up the battlefield, and be wary of the seam monsters returning. Also, he paused and asked as Linimo had instructed beforehand, &quot;Were the sea monsters that attacked you more ferocious than usual, and did they seem to be launching an organized attack?&quot; Chunhai&#x27;s expression changed, and he nodded emphatically. &quot;My benefactor is wise.&quot; Is indeed so.</p>
<p>Although these beasts are usually fierce, they would not recklessly attack our defensive weaknesses wave after wave. Moreover, about half a day before the attack began, we noticed that the fish in the nearby sea were darting around like madmen, and the seaater also had a strange smell. We suspected that someone was behind this. &quot;Are there any suspects?&quot; Xiaoai asked. Chanhai hesitated for a moment, then lowered his voice.</p>
<p>Before our island lord, Miss Su Chanchian, left, she reminded us to be careful of wings of freedom. During the battle just now, I thought I saw a ship shadow flash by on the distant sea, but it was too dark to see clearly. Or maybe I was just seeing things. Ziaoai understood, but remained outwardly calm. Understood.</p>
<p>We will stay in this area for a while to clear out any remaining threats. You guys hurry up and recover. If there are any further developments, you can use a fire signal for help. Thank you so much, my benefactor. Chunhai bowed deeply once again.</p>
<p>Ziaoai said no more, leaving behind some medicine and supplies under the guise of surplus supplies from the caravan and then led his team back to the small boat and sailed back to the Moan. Back on the ship, Ziao Tai gave Lin Mo a detailed report of the situation. Shinhai is reliable. He used to be a leader of the fisherman and has a lot of authority. Such Chanchian said after coming out of the cabin and hearing the report, the island s defenses were also planned with him before I left.</p>
<p>This time the losses are considerable that her voice was somewhat low. Yui, you done a great job. It has not easy to hold out until we arrive in the face of such an organized beast tide. Lynn Emmo comforted him, then turned to shau. The Mo Yuan will patrol and keep watch in the nearby waters, paying particular attention to any suspicious vessels spying on us.</p>
<p>Also, send a few small boats equipped with a makeshift energy resonators that Leewi rushed to build to probe the waters around the island and see if there are any remaining control nodes or traces of pherommonsta. Clear. Furthermore, Lyno looked at Sue Chanchian. Find a way to send Chan Hai some more specific warnings and defense advice without revealing our true identities. Use the same secret code you agreed on with him during your previous anonymous transaction and smuggle the information through the medicine package left on the island.</p>
<p>Remind him to strengthen nighttime vigilance. Stockpile more oil and long range weapons. Pay attention to water and food safety and minimize going to sea in the near future. also hint to him that if he encounters an insurmountable danger, he can evacuate to the southeast. Su Chians eyes lit up slightly.</p>
<p>I understand. I&#x27;ll go write it right away. Lynn Mos arrangements were swiftly implemented. The Mo Yuan, like a loyal guardian, slowly patrolled the outer perimeter of the island. Several small proboats, like worker ants, carefully searched the nearby waters.</p>
<p>2 hours later, a small probo brought back the news. We found this in a crevice in an underwater reef about two nautical miles northeast of the island. A team member presented an object wrapped in a waterproof cloth that emitted a faint fishy smell. Upon opening the package, inside was a damaged fist-sized metal can. The surface of the can had rough scratches, and inside were traces of a viscous dark green liquid, very pheromone.</p>
<p>There really are still some release points left, Leeway exclaimed, both excited and furious through remote analysis via the comp shell. This canister has a timed or controlled rupture device, which should be used to continuously release pherommones to maintain attraction and stimulation for the marine life in this area. The main control node we destroyed was probably responsible for large scale and powerful commands, while these small canisters are maintaining local hotspots. Can we find any clues about who put there? Lynn Emmo asked. The team member shook his head.</p>
<p>The jar is very ordinary. It looks like it was crudely made by hand and there are no markings. We didn&#x27;t find any other traces in the surrounding water either. Caesar is very careful. Sure house sneered.</p>
<p>He uses cheap little jars sets up remotely or in advance. So even if he has discovered, he can&#x27;t he be traced back to him. Dot. Lynn Mo stared coldly at the rough metal can. This insidious yet effective method of harassment and weakening was indeed reminiscent of Caesar style.</p>
<p>This time it was a pheromone can. What about next time? Clean up all the jars we find. Expand the search area. Lynn Emmo ordered. Also notify Chunghai and tell them not to eat any fish caught in the nearby waters recently, just in case.</p>
<p>He walked to the ship&#x27;s railing, gazing at the island as it gradually regained its lights and began to heal its wounds. This time they had caught up. But what about next time? Caesar&#x27;s shadow was everywhere. And this asymmetrical attritional attack was impossible to defend against. He must speed things up.</p>
<p>He needs to consolidate his forces, acquire more resources, find Caesar&#x27;s weaknesses, and even launch a preemptive strike. Chian. He turned to Sue Chanchan who had just returned after delivering the message and said, &quot;Once it s light and we confirmed it s here for now, we ll head back immediately. There&#x27;s still many things waiting for us at home. As for Caesar, we need to settle this score with him properly.&quot; Dot.</p>
<p>Looking at the cold determination in his eyes, Su Chian knew that Linmo, who had been quietly developing and hiding his strength, was gradually revealing the true sharpness of the king of storms because of the repeated force defenses and rescues. Beneath the surface, the undercurrents never cease. And above the water, new storms are quietly brewing. Chapter 52. Counterattack.</p>
<p>As dawn broke over the sea, the Mo Yuan was already far from Sue Chanchchan&#x27;s island, sailing on its return journey. The ship bore several fresh wounds, and the deck still carried a faint, lingering smell of blood, but the atmosphere on board was completely different from when it set sail. Exhaustion was still etched on everyone&#x27;s faces, but their eyes held a heavier weight. the anger of witnessing the devastation of their allies homeland, the confidence gained from long range support and precise breakthroughs, and a profound weariness of the wings of freedom&#x27;s ruthless tactics. Linmo barely slept.</p>
<p>He stood in the ship&#x27;s deck, a nautical chart, intermittent analysis summaries transmitted by Leeway via encrypted communication, and a recent intelligence report on the trade zone compiled by Chandu Duo spread out before him. Such Chanchian leaned back in a chair nearby, taking a nap, her brows furrowing slightly even in her sleep. The method Caesar used this time were lowcost, spread quickly, and were impossible to defend against that Lin Mos finger traced on the sea chart from the location where they encountered the dragon soul to sue Chaness Island and then pointed to the area marked with abnormal energy further northeast. A single control node coupled with multiple pheromone release points can create a regional continuous beast tide harassment. This time it was Chians Island.</p>
<p>Next time it could be other outposts of the dragon soul or any small or medium-sized settlement that is on friendly terms with us. He has testing the waters and he has also wearing us down. Sure how said in a low voice. He has testing the actual effectiveness of this weapon and the reactions from all sides while depleting the resources and morale of potential adversaries. Moreover, I suspect he is using this harassment to cover up his real operations in the northeast.</p>
<p>Linimo nodded. Caesar must also know about the energy anomaly that dragon soul discovered and he might even know more. Guiding the beast tide to attack Chanchian Island can both strike at us and draw the attention of all parties, including Dragon Soul, to this victim zone, providing cover for him to explore the anomaly area in depth. It&#x27;s killing multiple birds with one stone. Then we sure looked at Linmo.</p>
<p>Hurry up and get home. Lynmo&#x27;s gaze was sharp. We need to integrate all the information we&#x27;ve gathered this time. the weaknesses of the controlled beast tide, the possible intelligence about the abnormal energy in the northeast, and the dragon souls intention for closer cooperation. Then we&#x27;ll formulate our response.</p>
<p>He looked at the intelligence summary sent by Chien Duo Duo, which mentioned that several major trading points in the Freedom Wings controlled area had recently seen unusual purchases of defensive and counterattack materials such as high tenacity ropes, waterproof fire oil, and large crossbow parts, and that these purchases were being made without regard cost. At the same time, several middlemen who had secret dealings with Freedom Wings had boasted at the dinner table that a big deal is coming soon, and we&#x27;re going to pull off a deal that will shut everyone up. Caesar was stockpiling supplies, preparing for a major operation. Combined with the unusual energy activity to the northeast, his target was almost obvious. Furthermore, Lyno added, &quot;After we return, have wei prioritized two tasks.</p>
<p>First, based on the analysis of pherommones and core crystals, quickly develop even the most rudimentary broadspectctrum dispersant or signal jammer prototype. Complete decryption isn&#x27;t necessary. Simply reducing the guiding efficiency of the beast tide is sufficient. Second, using the rune tower, attempt limited purification or reprogramming research on the captured core crystals. Even if it only disables one of them or causes it to emit a chaotic signal in reverse, it will be a significant breakthrough.</p>
<p>Clear. The voyage was spent in intense review and planning. When the familiar outline of Mayuin Pavilion Island and the striking faint light of the rune tower in the center of the island came into view again, it was already dusk of the second day. The dock was a hive of activity. Chin Duo Duo, who had received advanced notice, had already organized a team to welcome the ship while also maintaining perimeter security.</p>
<p>The Mo Yuan slowly docked and its gangway was lowered. Linmo was the first to disembark, his feet landing firmly on solid ground once more. Although he had only been away for a few days, it felt like he had gone through a long battle. Everything on the island was in perfect order. The fortifications have been clearly reinforced.</p>
<p>There were many figures on the watchtowers, and the air was filled with a tense atmosphere of impending action, but also with a reassuring sense of stability. Welcome home, boss. Chi and Duo Duo greeted him, his chubby face beaming with genuine joy. But there was also a hint of seriousness in his eyes. While Urani&#x27;s past few days, nothing went wrong at home.</p>
<p>But things outside have gotten even more tense. Let&#x27;s go inside and talk. Lynn Emmo patted his shoulder. The group quickly arrived at the core council chamber of the inner fortress. The soft glow of the rune tower shone through the windows, making the room exceptionally tranquil.</p>
<p>A subtle contrast to the barely perceptible tension outside. Leeway practically burst in carrying a pile of new scrap paper and several mineral samples shimmering with different faint lights. Boss, a breakthrough. I found three potentially effective frequency bands for pheromone interference. Although the tower&#x27;s computing power, he insisted on using that term, is limited and the derivation results have significant errors, it&#x27;s worth a try.</p>
<p>Also, we&#x27;ve made progress on the energization treatment of the core crystal. Using a specific frequency of energy impact combined with low temperature can accelerate the necrosis of its internal biological networks. Although it can&#x27;t be reversed, it can completely turn it into a useless rock. And he spoke rapidly and fluently. Lynn Mo listened patiently and affirmed his work.</p>
<p>Very good. Immediately begin preparing for the physical testing of the jamming device and the safety verification of the inertia process. Just let Duo Duo know what resources you need. Leeway excitedly agreed and ran off in a flurry. Next, Chi and Duodo gave a detailed report on the island&#x27;s internal affairs and external intelligence, focusing on the wings of Freedom&#x27;s resource mobilization and the movements of several suspicious ships.</p>
<p>Shirhow then reported on the island&#x27;s defense reinforcement and the emergency repair arrangements for the MOUN. Such Chian listened quietly, occasionally adding her observations about the types and behavioral details of the beast tide creatures. Her emotions had calmed down considerably, but deep in her eyes, the scars of her homeland being attacked were still clearly visible. Finally, Lynn Emmo integrated all the information and made a series of plans. One, the island is placed on level two alert, second only to direct attack.</p>
<p>Patrol levels are increased and the outer reconnaissance network is encrypted, paying particular attention to movements from the northeast and the wings of freedom. Second, accelerate the research on anti-beast tide technology led by Lee Wei and try to produce simple equipment that has been proven effective in small batches such as improved silent room pieces, blasting tubes, etc. Third, led by Chiandu Duo, the Mo Yuan Pavilion secretly spread the word through reliable channels that the Mo Yuan Pavilion has mastered some methods to combat the controlled beast tide, and is willing to provide limited technical advice and material support to friendly forces in order to attract allies, disrupt Caesar&#x27;s deployment, and enhance their own reputation. Fourth, in a formal reply to Dragon Soul, it agreed to establish a strategic cooperation framework that includes real-time intelligence sharing, joint crisis response, and limited technology exchange and proposed to hold a highle meeting as soon as possible to discuss joint action plans targeting the Northeast Energy Anomaly Area and Wings of Freedom. V internally expedite the formulation of follow-up reinforcement plan for the storm sailboat emo yuan and initiate early material reserves and design planning for a second warship of the same class.</p>
<p>Caesar wants to use underhanded tactics to wear us down and disrupt the situation, making it easier for him to fish in troubled waters. Lynamo concluded, his voice clear and powerful in the quiet council hall. Then we&#x27;ll do the opposite. We&#x27;ll solidify our position, unite with our friends, bear our fangs, and expose what he most wants to hide to everyone. If he wants to grow his power secretly, we&#x27;ll make sure everyone is watching that area, leaving him no opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>If he wants war, we&#x27;ll fight him. But the battlefield and the timing can&#x27;t be decided by him alone. Everyone solemnly accepted the order and left to carry it out. Only Linmo and Su Chanchian remained in the council hall. The afterlow of the setting sun shone through the window lattice, casting a warm hue over the rune tower&#x27;s glow.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Lyn Mo,&quot; Su Changian said softly. &quot;For my island, and for everyone who was forced into this. It is not just for you.&quot; Do Lin Emo shook his head, looking at the lights gradually coming on outside the window. A man like Caesar only cares about conquest and plunder. Today he might attack your island to test weapons.</p>
<p>And tomorrow he might destroy anyone else home for resources. Fighting him is not just about revenge or self-preservation, but about ensuring that this sea area can still have a place where people can reason, have principles, and live in pea. He turned to look at Sue Chian. Besides, we now have the ability to do some things. The title of King of Storms isn&#x27;t given lightly.</p>
<p>Looking at his resolute profile outlined by the setting sun, Su Chanchian felt the bewilderment and gloom in her heart caused by the attack on their homeland gradually dissipate in the calm and powerful aura emanating from him. She walked to his side and together they gazed out the window at the territory that was being shrouded in twilight, yet teeming with life thanks to the countless lights and rune tower glow. M. She responded softly, her voice low, but carrying the same firmness. The returning ships have entered port, but a new journey has already begun.</p>
<p>The hidden blades have been revealed, while the storm in the open is slowly taking shape. Chapter 53. The Omen from the heart of the tower. 7 days after the rune tower was completed, Leeway finally dragged himself out of the top floor research room, which was filled with strange energy and the smell of straw paper. His steps were unsteady and he had heavy bags under his eyes, but he was tightly clutching a thick roll of blueprints tied with fishkin rope in his hand.</p>
<p>His face had a strange expression that mixed with great fatigue and excitement as he headed straight for the inner fortress workshop area where Lin Mo was. Lynn and Mo and sure how were inspecting a new batch of trial produced sound blasting tubes. These improved bamboo tubes had thin iron plates lining their inner walls were filled with more evenly distributed gunpowder and sharp fragments of pottery. And the fuses were waterproofed, making them significantly more powerful than the previous homemade versions. Boss, major discovery.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not a jammer nor an inertization process. Leewi&#x27;s voice was extremely penetrating, drawing the attention of the surrounding craftsman. It&#x27;s a rune tower. I&#x27;ve created a predictive model by combining the tower&#x27;s own detection array with the ocean energy fluctuation data provided by Miss Sue as well as some environmental energy characteristics that I deduced from those pherommones. Lynn Mo way for the craftsman to continue then ledly way to a relatively quiet area where materials were stored.</p>
<p>What predictive model? The weather or rather a large-scale periodic disturbance of environmental energy. Leeway eagerly unfolded the drawings which were filled with complex curves, waveforms, and dense annotations. Look here. This is the free energy reading curve of the environment around the island recorded by the rune tower over the past 30 days. And look at these mark points.</p>
<p>These are the several obvious weather changes we experienced the first storm, the subsequent continuous sunny days, the brief period of muggy weather, and the unusually cold and foggy sea fog we encountered a few days ago on our return voyage. Dot. He traced the curve with his finger. Did you notice the pattern? About 36 to 48 hours before each drastic weather change, the activity and chaos indicators of environmental free energy show a gradual increase followed by a rapid rise reaching their peak simultaneously with a weather change and then quickly declining. And for different weather types, the slope of the rising curve and the energy color, this is how the towers detection array distinguishes different energy characteristics, which I&#x27;ll call it for now, show subtle but identifiable differences.</p>
<p>Linmo carefully examined the curves. Although he couldn&#x27;t understand the specific parameters, the correlation between the key turning points marked by Leewi and the timing of weather events was indeed clear. You mean the rune tower can provide early weather warnings by monitoring changes in environmental energy? It has more than just an early warning. Leeway excitedly pointed to another set of comparison images. This is data on subtle changes in water energy recorded by Miss Sue.</p>
<p>Since by the heart of the ocean before large-scale anomalies in marine life after overlaying and analyzing it with atmospheric energy changes recorded by the tower, I found that they are linked. Moreover, atmospheric energy changes came first. In other words, it is very likely that some kind of periodic energy disturbance in the atmosphere first affected the energy field of the large-scale marine environment, thereby inducing abnormal behavior in marine life. The pherommones used by Caesar were likely just a targeted and malicious amplification and guidance based on this natural background disturbance. This deduction made Lin Mo and sure how beside him both tents.</p>
<p>If this were true, then the so-called controlled beast tide was not merely a technological weapon of the wings of freedom, but a malicious exploitation of some natural law. This explained why the beast tide could affect such a wide area and also meant that this threat might be periodic. Can you predict the next large-scale background disturbance? What is the specific time and what are the possible types of impacts? Lynn Emmo immediately grasped the key question. That&#x27;s the significance of the model. Leeway pulled out a newly drawn chart showing an upward sloping curve extrapolated from existing data.</p>
<p>According to the model&#x27;s calculations, the next large-scale environmental energy disturbance is likely to occur in 15 to 20 days. Based on the shape of the rising curve and preliminary energy color characteristics, this disturbance leans towards low temperature and stagnation attributes. Combining this with basic climate knowledge is highly likely to be a large-scale cold wave accompanied by strong winds and widespread temperature drops. A cold wave, sure, how gasped. If a large-scale cold wave really comes at this time of year, the seam may freeze over, making it difficult for ships to move.</p>
<p>Heating and food preservation will become major problems. Many small and medium-sized islands simply cannot withstand it. Leeway nodded emphatically. Moreover, if Caesar had a similar predictive method, he might have detected it even earlier than us. He could have used pherommones to drive away or gather certain coldresistant sea creatures before the cold wave arrived and then launched a targeted attack when the cold wave was at its most intense and everyone was preoccupied with their own survival.</p>
<p>Or he could have simply used the cold wave itself as a weapon to strike those unprepared forces. Lynn Emo silently tapped the wood beside him with his fingers. A chill seemed to creep up his spine before he knew it. He hadn&#x27;t been unaware of the threat of extreme weather, but he had always considered it an unpredictable natural risk. If he could foresee it 10 or 20 days in advance, the significance would be entirely different.</p>
<p>This is no longer a simple survival challenge, but a bargaining chip in a strategic game. What is the accuracy of this prediction? What conditions are needed for the model to be continuously improved and validated? Lyn Mo asked quickly. Currently, the data sample is too small, and I estimate the accuracy to be at most 60%. But as long as we can continuously record future weather changes and energy data, the model will self-correct and the accuracy will improve rapidly, Leeway replied. The rune tower s detection array is key.</p>
<p>It provides energy readings that are more precise and stable than any of our previous instruments. Miss Sue heart of the ocean sensing data is an important auxiliary verification. In addition, if we can deploy some simple energy reading collection points in a wider sea area, even if it s just sending people to measure them periodically, it can greatly expand the model s data sources and prediction range. Dot. Lenmo pondered gathering point.</p>
<p>This requires reliable manpower and a safe flight path which the current coverage area of the Moanon Pavilion cannot yet provide. But Dragon Soul might be a viable option. Leeway immediately compile a detailed report including the model&#x27;s principles, prediction basis, possible errors, and improvement needs. Raise the encryption level to the highest level. Lynn Mo ordered.</p>
<p>Sure, how notify Chin Duo Duo and Chian to come over. We have new strategic issues to discuss. Half an hour later, the core members gathered again in the council chamber. Lynn Emmo succinctly conveyed Lee Wei&#x27;s findings and predictions. Upon hearing this, Chindwood was small eyes immediately narrowed into slits.</p>
<p>Knowing about the cold wave in advance, good heavens, that&#x27;s a huge business opportunity, a huge strategic advantage if we stockpile warm clothing, fuel, and durable food in advance. It&#x27;s not just about hoarding, Su Changian said softly, carefully examining the energy curve drawn by Leewi, lost in thought. If the cold wave is as predicted, many fish from tempered areas will migrate to warmer waters or enter deeper waters to hibernate. Coastal catches will plummet. Some temperature sensitive seaweed and shellfish may die off in large numbers.</p>
<p>This will trigger a chain reaction. For Caesar, this is both an opportunity and a risk. Sure, how analyzed. He may use the cold wave to strike his opponents, but the cold wave will also affect his ship maneuvers and supply lines. If he is indeed planning a major operation in the region of abnormal energy in the northeast, the cold wave may disrupt his schedule or force him to take risks ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Da. Therefore, our strategy needs to be implemented in several steps. Lynn Emo summarized his gaze sweeping over everyone. First leeway, your team must do everything in its power to ensure the continuous and stable operation of the rune tower detection array and constantly improve the prediction model. At the same time, based on the prediction of low temperature stagnation, immediately begin to study targeted protection or mitigation measures such as how to keep important facilities running during cold waves, how to prevent water pipes from freezing and bursting, and how to ensure the production of green houses if any.</p>
<p>Second, Chindo Duo. Utilize all our commercial channels and inventory to secretly, discreetly, and in batches acquire and stockpile the following materials. All types of fur, down, and thick fabrics: charcoal, fuel oil, and any fuel that can burn stably, high calorie, long-lasting grains, and dried meat, and herb for treating frostbite and colds. Be careful with your methods to avoid causing significant market fluctuations or suspicion. At the same time, we can appropriately increase the production of our existing thermal products such as the warmstone imitations we sold during the previous extreme cold weather, but temporarily keep them in stock.</p>
<p>Third, sure how, immediately add an extreme cold wave response module to the island defense plan. Check the windproof and heat insulation performance of all buildings and ensure that watchtowwers and important outposts have heating points. Develop antifreeze protection and emergency deployment plans for ships such as the yuon in low temperature environments. Strengthen the fire prevention and anti- theft anti-robery levels of fuel and grain warehouses. Fourth, Linmo looked at Sue Chanchan.</p>
<p>Chian, I need you to cooperate with Leeway and use your abilities to continuously monitor subtle changes in the marine environment and cross validate them with the data from the tower. At the same time, think about which marine biological resources might be relatively stable or usable if your island were to face such a cold wave. We need to prepare some survival advice for a wider range of allies. Fifth, and most importantly, Lynn Mo&#x27;s tone turns somber. The strategic cooperation with Dragon Soul needs to be accelerated.</p>
<p>This cold wave forecast can serve as an important bargaining chip for us to demonstrate our sincerity and value. We need to share some forecast information. Not all of it, of course, in exchange for their cooperation in deploying energy monitoring points in a wider sea area and to reach a deeper agreement on military cooperation in the event of a potential crisis created by Caesar using the cold wave. He stood up, walked to the window, and gazed at the rune tower that quietly emitted a faint glow in the night. This time, we must weave a protective net and prepare an icebreaking ax before the storm truly arrives.</p>
<p>Caesar wants to use the opportune moment to harm us. So, we must turn this opportune moment into our advantageous location and harmonious relationships. A cold wave is coming. He turned around, his eyes sharp as knives in the lamplight, and we must be the first to put on our winter clothes and be ready to face the wind and snow. Dot.</p>
<p>Chapter 54. Alliance and cold edge. On the morning of the third day, as agreed, the Dragon Souls envoy appeared precisely on the horizon southeast of Mayu Pavilion Island. It was a well-maintained, medium-sized warship with strong lines. Its dragon pattern flag fluttering in the seab breeze.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t approach rashly, but instead stopped outside the warning line, raising signal flags to identify itself and its purpose. Cautious and courteous, standing on a watchtower of the main island, Linmo looked at the ship and said to sure how beside him, send a speedboat to guide it directly to port number two. Have Chin Duo Duo receive it there. according to the previously agreed second level ally etiquette. Understood.</p>
<p>Sure, how nodded. Then asked, &quot;Boss, are you really planning to share part of the cold wave forecast information? Isn&#x27;t that too risky? Share a part in exchange for more.&quot; Lin MOS gaze was calm. Relying solely on our own monitoring points, the range and accuracy of our predictions are limited. Dragon Soul has a wider sphere of influence and manpower. We need their data to improve our model so that we can more accurately judge Caesar as possible movements.</p>
<p>Moreover, by throwing out this bait, we can also show them our value and sincerity, paving the way for deeper cooperation. What about Caesar&#x27;s side? Caesar one TB idle at Lynn Mo turned to the north of the island in the direction of the wings of freedom mass controlled area. He has also preparing. We predicted the cold wave, but he might have detected it through other means. This cold wave is a test and an opportunity for everyone.</p>
<p>It all depends on who is better prepared and who acts more decisively. Dot. The speedboat led the Dragon Souls envoy ships slowly into port number two, which was surrounded by reefs and newly built watchtowers. The dock area had been cleared out and she and Duod Duo accompanied by several neatly dressed compared to the others on the island assistants with professional smiles on their faces went to greet them. Allighting from the Dragon Soul ship were Xiao Ji Gang and two other men who appeared to be an agitant and a civilian employee.</p>
<p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries at the dock, they headed towards the council hall in the inner fortress district led by Chiandu Duo. Along the way, Xiao Ji Gangs sharp gaze swept over the island&#x27;s well-organized fortifications, the busy but not panicked residents, and a rune tower in the distance that was clearly different from ordinary buildings, his eyes occasionally flashing with amazement. Inside the council chamber, Lyno was already waiting. He had changed into a clean, dark-colored cloth robe without much adorement, but his demeanor was composed. Su Chanchian and Leewi were also present.</p>
<p>Captain Xiao, welcome. Lin Emo stood up to greet him. Lord Lin Mo, I apologize for disturbing you. Xiao Ji Gang cupped his hands, his posture neither humble nor arrogant. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to formally thank you for our battle last time.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been ordered to come here to discuss cooperation matters. After both sides took their seats without much formality, they quickly got down to business. Xiao Ji Gang representing the senior management of Dragon Soul first formally expressed the desire to establish a comprehensive strategic cooperative relationship with Mo Yuan Pavilion and proposed a preliminary draft cooperation framework covering multiple aspects such as intelligence sharing military coordination nondirect command technical exchange to a limited extent and joint crisis response. Lynn Mo listened carefully but did not immediately respond to the content of the draft. Instead, he gestured to Leewi.</p>
<p>Leewi Ching cleared his throat, stood up, and showed Xiao Ji Gang and the others several pre-prepared simplified charts. The core algorithm and specific data of the rune tower were hidden. He tried to explain the potential correlation between periodic disturbances in environmental energy and large-scale weather changes in plain language and based on existing models pointed out the high probability of a major weather anomaly with biased low temperature stagnation attributes occurring in the next 15 to 20 days. This means that a potentially regional and significant cold wave is brewing. Leewi concluded his voice slightly with tension.</p>
<p>If not handled properly, it will cause serious losses and if it is exploited by malicious individuals, the consequences will be unimaginable. Xiao Ji Gang and his agitants listened, their faces turning grave. Their civilian staff quickly took notes. As a large organization that had struggled in the survival world for so long, they were all too aware of the destructive power of extreme weather. Lord Lan Mo, this intelligence is extremely important.</p>
<p>Xiao Ji Gang said in a deep voice, &quot;I wonder what your side thinks of it.&quot; Weve made some progress through special observation methods and data analysis, Linmo said casually, but our monitoring range is limited and our prediction accuracy needs to be improved. This is one of the reasons why we hope to cooperate more deeply with you. Dragon Soul has a wider reach. And if we can share some basic environmental observation data for specific sea areas, such as regular changes in water temperature, air pressure, and ocean currents, perhaps we can work together to make early warnings earlier and more accurate. Xiao Ji Gang exchanged glances with his two agitants.</p>
<p>One of whom, a man who appeared to be in a clerical position, spoke quickly and in a low voice. Xiao Ji Gang nodded and turned to Lin Mo. Since you were so frank, we will be frank with you as well. Dragon Soul does indeed have meteorological and ocean current observation points in several key sea areas and the data can be shared. Moreover, we can coordinate more manpower to strengthen the monitoring of the energy anomaly area in the northeast.</p>
<p>In exchange, we hope that you can provide similar meteorological early warning analysis regularly and also exchange information on cold wave response technology to a certain extent. Sure. Lynn Mo readily agreed. We can share early warning analyses regularly. In terms of technical exchanges, we can provide some basic cold wave protection plans and material reserve suggestions.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding concerns that the Wings of Freedom might use such natural disasters to launch attacks, I suggest that we establish a direct communication and rapid response channel in case of emergency. Dot. That&#x27;s exactly what I was thinking. Xiao Ji Gang&#x27;s spirits lifted. The specific details can be discussed and finalized by our subordinates.</p>
<p>In addition, we have recently received some scattered but alarming intelligence regarding Wings of Freedom. He gestured for his agitant to report. The agitant produced a briefing. According to our intelligence personnel and external intelligence, the Wings of Freedom have been frequently mobilizing their elite ships over the past week, converging on a forward base code named iceclaw on the northeastern edge of their controlled area. Simultaneously, they have been acquiring large quantities of antifreeze, lubricating grease, high-grade antifreeze used in certain precision machinery, low temperature explosives, and closed body diving suit blueprints or finished products through the black market in several underground channels.</p>
<p>The scale of their acquisitions far exceeds what is normally required for cold weather preparedness. Lynn Mo lightly tapped his fingers on the table, focusing on antifreeze, diving, and demolition. These supplies were highly targeted and combined with the energy anomaly in the northeast and the potential cold wave. Caesar&#x27;s intentions were almost obvious he planned to conduct underwater or sub ice exploration/ operations in that anomalous area during or around the time of the cold wave. It seems Caesar has also set his sights on that area and is wellprepared even taking advantage of the cold wave.</p>
<p>Lynamo said slowly. Captain Xiao, how much do you know about that area with the abnormal energy? Xiao Ji Gang pondered for a moment. Our intelligence is incomplete. We only know that the underwater topography in that area is extremely complex with suspected large seabed structures and the energy readings fluctuate, occasionally interfering with ship compasses and communications. We sent a small submarine, a modified pressure vessel, to try to get closer for reconnaissance, but it was driven back by strong turbulence and unusually active deep sea creatures on the periphery.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very dangerous there. If Caesar really dares to force his way in during the cold wave, he&#x27;s either crazy or he has some trump card that we don&#x27;t know about. Lyn Mo thought of the unknown trump card. The monstrous technology that combined biological and energy elements, the mysterious mentor and the Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood. Behind Caesar, the waters run deep.</p>
<p>No matter what, we can&#x27;t let him succeed so easily. Lin Mo&#x27;s tone turned cold. If there&#x27;s really something in that area, it would be a disaster for everyone if it fell into the hands of someone like Caesar. Captain Xiao, we might be able to draft a preliminary coordination plan for jointly containing wings of Freedom&#x27;s operation. In the following period, the two sides held in-depth consultations on matters such as real-time intelligence sharing, deterrent patrols around the crutch base, and the establishment of joint observation posts near abnormal areas, and finalized the general principles and communication mechanisms.</p>
<p>The talks concluded in the afternoon. The two sides reached a deeper and more substantial cooperation agreement than expected. Xiao Ji Gang was clearly very satisfied with the outcome of the talks. Before leaving, he shook Lin Mos hand and solemnly said, &quot;Lord Lin Mo, Dragon Soul has shown great sincerity in this cooperation. We hope that we can join hands to establish proper order in this sea area and curb their insane ambitions.</p>
<p>This is also what Emo Yuan Pavilion wishes for,&quot; Lin Mo replied. After seeing off the Dragon Soul Envoy ship, Lin Emo immediately summoned the core members. &quot;The alliance has been established, but the real test has only just begun.&quot; Lyn Mos gaze swept over everyone. Caesar is gathering at Iceclaw, targeting the anomalous region in the northeast. A cold wave is approaching, and he must have something to rely on by choosing this time.</p>
<p>Leeway concentrate all computing power and combine it with the data that Dragon Soul will soon share. We must shorten the prediction window for the cold wave to the shortest possible time and determine its intensity level as much as possible. Sure. How the cold weather modifications and resupply the MOU on should begin immediately according to the highest combat readiness standards. At the same time, select a group of elites who are coldresistant and skilled in combat in icy water environments and begin targeted training.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo, in addition to the previously deployed stockpiled supplies, focus on searching for and acquiring technologies or materials related to antifreeze lubricating grease and closed diving suits, even if it&#x27;s just a clue. Also, intensify the acquisition of intelligence on the black market around the crutch base. Chian Lynn Emmo said, &quot;Turning to Sue Chanchian one last time, closely monitor the movements of marine life, especially the migration and aggregation of coldresistant species. Your perception is crucial for us to determine whether Caesar has used pherommones ahead of time to everyone solemnly accepted the order. Su Chian frowned slightly, looked towards the northeast, and whispered.</p>
<p>When Captain Xiao and the others mentioned ice claws and the anomalous area just now, my heart suddenly skipped a beat. It felt like something cold in the deeper sea had been disturbed. It was a very uncomfortable feeling. Lynn Mo&#x27;s heart tightened. Suchanians premonition was never unfounded.</p>
<p>He looked out the window. The sky seemed even darker than before. The sea breeze brought a more pronounced chill. The ink of the Covenant was barely dry when the cold front silently approached. And deep beneath the sea, the secrets coveted by ambition seemed to begin to stir restlessly.</p>
<p>The Storm King&#x27;s gaze once again fell upon the unknown icy sea. This time he would not merely be on the defensive. Chapter 55. Building a city to keep out the cold. The Dragon Souls envoy took away the Covenant, leaving behind a heavy responsibility and an increasingly urgent timetable.</p>
<p>The island of Moyuan did not relax after the conclusion of important diplomatic activities. On the contrary, like a tightly wound precision machine, it operated with even greater efficiency under the leadership of its respective officials. However, unlike the tension when dealing with an imminent attack, this busyiness carried a sense of certainty and preparedness. Lynn Mo spent an entire day accompanied by Sherh How and several workshop leaders meticulously inspecting the adjustments made to defenses and production throughout the island. They first went to the cliff area facing the sea to the east.</p>
<p>Here a semi-encclosed wind fortress was being built on the site of an existing watchtower. The structure was mainly made of stone and wood utilizing a natural cliff face and newly built walls to block the fierce northeast winds. The interior was designed with spaces for fireplaces for heating and observation holes to ensure that the centuries could still perform their duties without suffering from hypothermia in extremely cold and windy weather. The craftsmen chanting in unison used pulley systems to lift heavy stone blocks and carefully laid them together. The clanging and hammering sounds carried far on the sea breeze.</p>
<p>According to engineer Le&#x27;s worst case scenario calculation, the wind force on the sea surface may reach level eight or above during the cold wave accompanied by freezing rain or ice pellets. These wind forts must be able to withstand that environment and ensure that the people inside can survive. Dashure how pointed to a roof structure that was being reinforced. We used double- layered wooden boards with dried seaweed and clay sandwiched in between which provides insulation and wind protection. The windows are small and are double-sealed with thick oil paper and movable wooden boards.</p>
<p>Lenmo reached out and touched the thickness of the wall. Then looked at the sturdy base connecting to the cliff and nodded. What about fuel reserves? Each point needs to guarantee at least 7 days of uninterrupted heating. Charcoal and durable compressed Pete cakes are already being transported to the various outposts. In addition, manager Chien has obtained a batch of whale blubber, which can be used to make long-lasting oil lamps.</p>
<p>The light is weak, but the heat is longlasting for emergency use. The logistics foreman quickly replied. Leaving the cliff, they turned towards the inland supply depot area. It was busier than ever with several newly constructed semi underground warehouses taking shape. People were carrying bundles of furs, sacks of grain, jars of cured meat and dried fish, and medicines tightly wrapped in oil cloth, continuously transporting them in.</p>
<p>Chin duo duo spun around between the warehouses like a top, holding a list and occasionally giving loud instructions or quietly checking documents. Boss. Upon seeing Lynn and Mo, Chindu Duo wiped his sweat and ran over. The fur purchase went more smoothly than expected. Several small hunting camps in the north had a lot of stockpiled fur which we traded for with iron wear, salt, and some grain at a fair price.</p>
<p>Grain is a bit of a problem. Most of the coarse grains circulating in a market were bought up by us and a few other vendors. And the price of fine grains has increased by 30%. So I haven&#x27;t followed suit yet. As for fuel, we&#x27;ve stockpiled a lot of charcoal, but we still don&#x27;t have enough of Pete and whale oil, which burn longer.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve already sent people to scout out the black swamp further away. They say there are good pete layers there. We don&#x27;t need to force the supply of refined grains. Just make sure there&#x27;s enough coarse grains and durable potatoes and dried meat. Prioritize fuel supplies for outposts, workshops, medical points, and core residential areas.</p>
<p>Lenmo looked at the bustling crowd. Check the warehouses for moisture and fire prevention. Again, if there&#x27;s a large temperature difference between indoors and outdoors during a cold wave, condensation will also be a problem. Understood? Lime has been added to each warehouse to absorb moisture, and the ventilation openings have been designed to prevent rain and snow from flowing back in. Chindo Duo assured him, patting his chest.</p>
<p>The final stop on the inspection tour was the workshops and rune tower in the core area. Inside the workshops, furnaces roared and the sounds of hammering filled the air. Under Leewayi&#x27;s guidance, craftsmen were undertaking final anti-reeze modifications to the MOU on applying special antifreeze grease to key mechanical components, filling any shrinkage gaps in the whole planks with a mixture of hair and adhesive, and creating antireeze covers for weapons such as crossbows. Another group was mass-producing Leeway&#x27;s simple heater, essentially a modified brazier with added flu and radiators. the rudimentary.</p>
<p>It improved thermal efficiency and safety. Inside the rune tower, the atmosphere was quiet and focused. Su Chanchian sat on a cushion beside the central array, her eyes closed in concentration. She wasn&#x27;t using combat perception, but rather a gentler, more continuous listening, sensing the slow, steady changes in the ocean&#x27;s energy background and corroborating them with the detailed data streams recorded on the tower. Leeway along with his two most astute apprentices stood around several newly installed stone slabs engraved with intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Several secondary energy storage crystals were embedded in the slabs, their light flickering slowly according to a certain pattern, projecting simplified energy readings into the air. The tower&#x27;s harmonic analysis function is even more powerful than I thought. Seeing Lynn Mo enter, Leeway excitedly lowered his voice. It can not only record the quantity and activity of environmental energy but also analyze its frequency composition. Look, the specific low frequency band representing the low temperature stagnation characteristic has increased in intensity by 15% in the past 48 hours and the rise curve is getting steeper and steeper.</p>
<p>The first batch of peripheral data shared by Dragon Soul also shows that the surface temperature of a sea has dropped by nearly 2° at several observation points about 500 nautical miles to the northeast. The cold wave may arrive a little faster than we initially predicted and its intensity may also be greater. Linmo walked to the stone slab looking at the abstract yet clearly defined ripples. Can be accurate to the day? Leeway leaned closer and pointed to a slowly rising curve. Based on this acceleration, I estimate that a large-scale cooling and strong wind will likely begin in 12 to 14 days.</p>
<p>But the vanguard such as sudden strong winds and sporadic freezing rain may affect our outer sea areas in 7 or 8 days. Lynn Emmo silently calculated in his mind that it would take 12 to 14 days. Time was tighter than he had hoped. Is the data integration with Dragon Soul going smoothly? he asked. Successfully.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re using a similar bassband communication crystal as us, although the encoding method is different, but the tower can decode it. They&#x27;ve agreed to synchronize key data from their 17 observation points every 6 hours, Leewi said. Then revealed a hint of distress. With the data volume increasing, the tower&#x27;s processing capacity is a bit lagging behind. My apprentices and I have to spend a lot of time manually filtering and comparing.</p>
<p>If only there were a way for the tower to do the initial data filtering and trend identification itself. That as a matter for the next step mo patted his shoulder. Right now your enchantes assessments are our most reliable early warning system. Continue monitoring and notify me immediately of any significant changes. Dot.</p>
<p>Emerging from the rune tower. Dusk was approaching. The sea breeze carried a noticeable chill stinging his face. Lynmo didn&#x27;t return to the council hall, but strolled to a relatively flat beach on the southern side of the island. Far from the main fortifications and docks, it was quieter.</p>
<p>Several small fishing boats, having undergone repairs, lay a ground on the sand. The fishermen, making final reinforcements in preparation for days when they might be unable to go out to sea. He saw that Sue Chanchian had also arrived here at some point, standing alone on a reef, gazing at the southern sea. Her figure appeared somewhat frail in a rising sea breeze. Lynmo walked over and draped a thick cloak over her shoulders.</p>
<p>Why did you come out? It&#x27;s warmer inside the tower. I wanted to get some fresh air and see the sea again. Such an pulled her cloak tighter without turning around. Leewi said that the cold wave might change the paths of many ocean currents, affecting the migration of fish. I&#x27;m wondering where those creatures that have always lived in this area will go.</p>
<p>Will they be able to adapt? There was a faint sadness in her voice about the changes in nature. Lynn Mo knew that this was not only a concern for the marine ecology, but also an underlying worry for her island that had just experienced trauma. Life always finds a way out. Lynn Mo stood beside her. And together they looked at the vast horizon where the seam met the sky.</p>
<p>Just like us, when we knew in advance that the cold wind was coming, we would find ways to build walls and light campfires. Your islanders, having received the warning you sent back, must be busy preparing now as well. Shun Hai is an experienced man. He knows what to do. Doc Su Chian responded softly, paused for a moment, and then send a low voice.</p>
<p>Lyno, sometimes I wonder if we&#x27;re interfering too much. Caesar using pherommones to guide the beast tide is evil. but predicting the weather in advance, stockpiling resources, uniting with allies, and even trying to stop his exploration as sent that another form of interference. Lynmo turned his head and looked at her seriously. If intervention means preventing innocent people from starving or freezing to death, preventing ambitious people&#x27;s crazy plans from succeeding easily, and maintaining basic order and bottom line in the sea area, then I think such intervention is necessary.</p>
<p>He looked north, his gaze seemingly piercing through the vast distance, landing on the ice claw base and that unknown anomalous area. Caesar only saw conquest and plunder. His intervention was to turn everyone into his slaves or stepping stones. What we do is to give those who are willing to reason and cooperate a chance to survive and thrive at Linmo&#x27;s voice was not loud, but every word was clear. There is a fundamental difference between the two.</p>
<p>Such Chian savored his words, the confusion in her eyes gradually fading, replaced by a clear and resolute determination. She pulled her cloak tighter, feeling the warmth of the wool and also the more solid warmth emanating from the person beside her. &quot;I understand,&quot; she said. &quot;Then let us make the walls we need to build even stronger.&quot; Dot. As darkness fell completely, lights began to illuminate the island, their glow mingling with the constant soft glow of the rune tower, creating a vibrant and warm silhouette of the isolated island amidst the increasingly cold sea breeze.</p>
<p>The cold winds are still gathering strength in the distance. But every stone, every bundle of firewood, and every heart beating busily in the face of the bitter cold on the island is silently proclaiming, &quot;We are ready.&quot; Chapter 56. the first appearance of the ice shadow. Leeway practically lived on the top floor of the rune tower. The analytical stone slabs, once engraved with energy conducting patterns, were now surrounded by more recording boards and hastily prepared calculation papers.</p>
<p>The air was thick with the sense of squid ink, age parchment, and a faint, peculiar aroma of heated crystal. His two apprentices, their eyes dark rimmed, carefully placed a large stack of temperature, salinity, and basic energy readings, freshly transcribed from the latest synchronization data from Dragon Soul on a speciallymade wooden shelf beside the stone slabs. Teacher, the Dragon Soul North Reef number seven observation point reports that a brief but sharp drop in deep water temperature was recorded in the early morning followed by a rebound, but the overall temperature curve has shifted down by 0.5°. that an apprentice reported in a horse voice. In addition, an abnormal infrasound fluctuation was detected at the long wave number three point lasting for about 3 minutes with the source depth estimated to be more than 300 m in the direction pointing northeast to east.</p>
<p>Leeway looked up from a pile of blueprints, rubbed his bloodshot eyes, and strode to the stone slab corresponding to the sea area. He adjusted the angle of a few inlaid crystals, then picked up a speciallymade bone pen, dipped it in some shimmering energy conducting powder, and quickly sketched several auxiliary lines along the blank edges of the stone slab. A sudden drop in deep water temperature and infrasound fluctuations, he muttered to himself, pausing with his bone pen. This doesn&#x27;t t seem like the influence of a simple atmospheric cold front. It has more like something on the seabed is breathing or turning over.</p>
<p>Another apprentice asked cautiously. Master, could it be some kind of large sea creature or seabed crustal activity? Uncertain. The energy signature doesn&#x27;t match known large organisms, nor does it resemble typical geothermal or geological activity. Leonat the density of Dragon Souls observation points is still insufficient, especially for deep sea data. If only we had an observation device capable of diving to that depth, he sighed, knowing it was unrealistic.</p>
<p>With current technology, modifying a sealed diving bell that could barely operate at a depth of 100 m was already the limit. There were also enormous water pressures and unknown risks to contend with. Mark these two anomalies as type A uncertainty and closely monitor their subsequent changes. continue receiving and processing data, especially regarding changes in seawater density gradient and bottom currents. Leeway instructed before returning to his main workbench.</p>
<p>There lay a larger blueprint, a sketch of his attempt to design an automatic trend indicator, rune circuit based on a rune tower detection array. Progress was slow. The complex energy flow logic and the isolation design to prevent rune conflicts were racking his brains. But even the slightest progress filled him with excitement. Meanwhile, on the other side of the island in the trade coordination center, converted from a warehouse area, Chando Duo welcomed two weary travelers wrapped in thick furs.</p>
<p>These two were independent intelligence brokers nicknamed Grey Rat and Ice Shard, whom he had contacted through several intermediaries. They were people who operated in the gray area surrounding the Iceclaw Bays for many years. The room wasn&#x27;t big, but it was warm enough with a clay stove. She and Do personally poured them some warm fruit wine, and there were a few but substantial pieces of dried meat and hard biscuits on the table. You two have worked hard, coming all this way in this cold weather.</p>
<p>She and Duo Duo smiled, his round face full of businessman&#x27;s affability. It&#x27;s just a small token of my appreciation. Gray Rat was a lean, middle-aged man with darting eyes. He carefully took a sip of wine and exhaled. Manager Chien, you&#x27;re too kind.</p>
<p>My brother and I have indeed found out some information about what you requested. I shard, remain silent, a frostbite scar on his face. He cuts straight to the point. Over at Iceclaw, more and more ships are gathering now exceeding 20 mostly Bloodsh class warships directly under Caesar&#x27;s command. Cargo is being unloaded day and night at the dock.</p>
<p>Everything is covered with tarpollins, so you can&#x27;t see everything, but what is exposed are large winch cables, boxes of crystallin anifreeze, and many sealed metal cylinders with strange patterns on them, unlike the markings we usually see. Chando Duo calmly noted it down and handed over a small bag of salt as an extra reward. Anything else? For example, have their people been in the nearby black market or fair recently besides buying supplies, contacted any special people, or have any unfamiliar faces brought anything special into Krampen? Grey Rat and Iceclaw exchange a glance. Gray Rat lowered his voice. About 2 weeks ago, a special kind of person, an old threemasted ship with a tattered merchant flag, but a deep draft, stopped overnight in a deserted cove west of Iceclaw.</p>
<p>It left before dawn the next day. Some of our brothers caught a glimpse of several people getting off the ship. They were all bundled up, but the way they walked didn&#x27;t seem like ordinary sailors or merchants. They looked more like craftsmen or scholars who often tinkered with intricate tools. They carried two long, heavy crates into a trolley that came to pick them up.</p>
<p>Where did that ship go after that? We headed north and entered the ice rift zone where there are many turbulent currents and hidden reefs. Ordinary ships dare not go in, so we didn&#x27;t follow. She and Duo Duo seemed thoughtful in the ice flow zone. That was a more northerly, harsher area than the Krampens with year round ice flows making navigation dangerous. Caesar had clearly arranged for his guests to meet there to avoid being noticed.</p>
<p>After asking more detailed questions and agreeing that any important information would continue to be transmitted through secret channels, she and Duo Duo finally saw the two intelligence brokers off. He closed a door, his smile fading, his brow furrowing slightly. A strangely patterned metal cylinder, a mysterious craftsman or scholar, a connection point deep within the broken ice zone. These fragmented pieces of information pieced together an increasingly enigmatic picture. Caesar&#x27;s preparations were far more complex than just the ships and supplies on the surface.</p>
<p>He immediately compiled the intelligence into an encrypted message and sent it to the inner fortress through a specific resonance crystal channel. When Lynn Mo received Chiendua&#x27;s intelligence, he was on the deck of the Mo Yuan, watching Show lead his men in a crossbow operation drill in a low temperature environment. The gunners wore thick mittens, making their movements slightly clumsy than usual, but they still tried their best to keep the process smooth. The sea breeze was biting and their breath turned to frost. After reading the message, Lyn Mo remained silent for a moment, then said assure how beside him, Caesar&#x27;s trump card might be more complicated than we thought.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not just going to explore. He&#x27;s likely going to open or activate something. It requires special craftsmen and special equipment. Sherow&#x27;s expression turned serious. Should I send someone to risk going to the broken eye zone to investigate? Lyn Mo shook his head.</p>
<p>Too far. the environment too harsh, the risks too high, it&#x27;s not worth it. Our focus should remain on the ice claw and the anomaly area in the northeast itself. Strengthen our reconnaissance cooperation with Dragon Soul and keep a close eye on the movements of Caesar&#x27;s main fleet. Also, he paused way and Chian analyze in detail what kind of chain reaction might be triggered if there really is some large structure or device on the seabed there under the specific energy environment of a cold wave when it is activated.</p>
<p>especially the secondary impact on the ecology and climate of the surrounding sea area. Clear when Lynn Mo relayed Chandua&#x27;s information and his own concerns to Leewi and Sue Shian in the rune tower, both of them fell into deep thought. Special craftsmen and equipment. Leewi paced back and forth. If it asked to open some kind of ancient civilization remnant facility, it might require a specific key, energy input method, or operating protocol.</p>
<p>Caesar may have obtained some knowledge from his mentor or some other channel. Could the metal cylinder be some kind of sealed energy battery or command core? Such an is more concerned about the ecological impact. If things on the seabed are activated, releasing a lot of energy or changing the local geomagnetic field and water temperature field, it may trigger more severe stress responses in marine organisms, even more terrible than pheromone guidance. Some deep sea jellyfish and analids are extremely sensitive to changes in geomagnetism and water pressure and may rise or migrate in large numbers, disrupting the entire food chain. She walked to the window and looked out at the gloomy sky and the sea which had become even darker in color.</p>
<p>I can feel that the sea is very uncomfortable. Beneath that calm, there&#x27;s a restlessness. It&#x27;s not anger, but more like it&#x27;s waiting for something or preparing for something. Lyno walked to her side and stood beside her. Outside the tower, the cold wind howled, swirling up scattered snowflakes from the ground.</p>
<p>The lights on the island stubbornly shone in the twilight, outlining the silhouettes of wind fortress, warehouses, and houses. Whatever is hidden below, whatever Caesar s intentions, Lin Mo&#x27;s voice was calm and firm. We are here. The walls are ready. The fire is ready.</p>
<p>The weapons are ready. The cold wave will come. Trouble will come, but we will not retreat. Su Chian softly hummed in agreement. The unease in her heart seemingly soothed by this calming power.</p>
<p>She gently placed her hand on the cool glass of the tower window as if she could touch the world outside which was gathering strength and waiting for change through it. The shadows beneath the deep sea and the gathering on the ice field both foreshadow the approaching storm. But this time they were no longer a drift. helpless boats. They were a fortress standing before the cold wave.</p>
<p>The first flame that refused to be extinguished in the shadows of the icy sea. Chapter 57. A conspiracy in the cold night. As the night deepened, the faint light of the rune tower became the most conspicuous lighthouse on the island. In a research room on the top floor, Leeway finally put aside the headacheinducing automatic trend indicator rune circuit and turned his attention back to the imminent threat.</p>
<p>He used a charcoal pencil to draw a simplified sea map on a new stone slab, marking the observation points shared by the dragon soul, the intelligence on the ice claw base obtained by Chanduo, the abnormally agitated marine life area sensed by Su Chian, and the leading edge of energy disturbances monitored by the rune tower. Look here, he said, pointing with his bone pin to the area of sea to the northeast that was highlighted. The vanguard of the energy disturbance at its current speed and increasing trend will overlap with the outer edge of the iceclaw area where Caesar s main fleet is currently assembled in 5 to 7 days. And according to our revised model, a large scale and drastic cooling and strong winds will fully erupt within 3 to 5 days after that dot. He drew a dotted line connecting the crackling to the core of the energy anomaly further northeast.</p>
<p>This means that if Caesar really wants to take action there, his best window of opportunity is likely during the period when the energy front passes, but before the full-blown cold wave arrives. Sea conditions will begin to deteriorate, but not to the point of being completely unnavigable. Moreover, this background noise of drastic changes in environmental energy might mask the special signals generated by some of their actions. Sitting to the side, Su Chian stared at the sea chart, her fingertips unconsciously touching the red, representing the core area of the energy anomaly. Leeway, if there really is something on that seabed that gets activated in this environment of violent energy fluctuations, will it cause secondary chaos in marine life? Just as we previously guessed, very likely, or even worse, that Leewi pushed up his glasses.</p>
<p>The dramatic changes in the energy field will stimulate sensitive organisms. If we add human activation behavior, releasing additional energy pulses or substances, it may trigger a short-term collapse of the local marine ecosystem, such as the mass death of organisms in specific water layers, or attracting some deep sea predators that we did not expect at all. Moreover, the scope of such an impact is difficult to predict. Linmo stood before the stone slab, arms crossed, listening silently. The candle light cast his long shadow swaying slightly on the rune covered wall.</p>
<p>Caesar one t care about any of that sure how voice came from the doorway. He had just returned from checking the night centuries and his leather armor still carried the chill of the outside world. He only cares about what he wants. Even if it causes a small-scale ecological disaster, he probably one t blink an eye as long as it helps him achieve his goal. Dot.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot let him succeed so easily. Lynn Mo finally spoke his voice steady. Leeway continue to refine your predictions, especially regarding the start and end times of that action window and the possible sea conditions. Chian, your perception is our most important means of detecting the Caesar fleetes unusual movements in advance. So you need to focus more but Dante push yourself too hard.</p>
<p>He turned to Sureh How and Chandu Duo who had just arrived. Sure how the final modification and crew adaptation training of the MOUN must be completed within 4 days. In addition, select a group of combat personnel who are most proficient in harsh sea conditions and underwater operations to form a special operations reserve team. Conduct intensive training and learn to use the new equipment that leeway rushed to build whether it is the disperser prototype or the deep water detection ball. Chando duo, you have two things to do.</p>
<p>First, intensify your efforts to acquire intelligence around Ice Claw, especially regarding their fleet composition, commander habits, and further information about those mysterious metal cylinders and craftsmen. Second, initiate the public opinion preparation we discussed earlier through our trading network under the guise of a veteran navigator&#x27;s concerns or ancient nautical chart warnings. moderately spread messages that the abnormal sea area in the northeast is extremely dangerous under certain weather conditions and may trigger the movement of unknown sea monsters. The messages don&#x27;t need to be too specific, but they should generate sufficient vigilance and discussion to increase public opinion resistance to Caesar&#x27;s actions. Chindwood was small eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>Understood. Stir up trouble and raise his operational costs. I&#x27;m good at this. Also, Dragon Soul just sent an encrypted briefing about a new situation discovered by one of their outpost teams about 80 nautical miles northeast of Iceclaw. He handed over a small note.</p>
<p>Linen Mo took it and quickly glanced at it. It read, &quot;3 days ago, an unusual movement of a small group of icebergs was discovered at coordinates XX. XX, suspected to be dragged by underwater forces. The tracks point towards the core area of the anomaly. Unnatural wear and trace amounts of metal residue were found on the surface of the icebergs.</p>
<p>Samples have been taken. Towing an iceberg underwater, Lin Moe&#x27;s eyes narrowed. How much power would that require? Was it some kind of giant seam monster? Or had Caesar already deployed some kind of large-scale underwater equipment unknown to them. Give this to Lee Wei for analysis. Lynn Mo handed the slip of paper to Leewi.</p>
<p>see if those metal residues can be linked to the strangely patterned metal cylinders found by Krampens. Leeway solemnly accepted it and immediately went to the analysis crystal to start working. The meeting came to a temporary close and everyone left to continue their work. Linmo did not leave the rune tower, but instead climbed the spiral stone steps to the open air platform at the top of the tower. The view here is superb, overlooking most of the island and the dark sea.</p>
<p>A biting wind blows relentlessly, carrying the salty, fishy smell and the scent of distant snow. Most of the island is asleep with only the patrols torches moving slowly between the fortifications like fireflies in the darkness. In the distance, the massive black silhouette of the Mo Yuan rests silently in the harbor, its outline barely discernable. Such Chian followed and silently stood beside him, handing him a warm copper teapot. Drink some ginger tea to warm yourself up.</p>
<p>Linmo took it, sipped it, and the spicy warmth traveled from his throat to his stomach, slightly dispelling the chill that had gripped him. &quot;Thank you.&quot; The two stood side by side, gazing at the deep night sky to the north. &quot;There, the clouds were thick and the stars were nowhere to be seen. Do you think we could stop him?&quot; Su Chanchian asked softly, her voice almost carried away by the wind. &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Lyno said honestly.</p>
<p>Caesar has been preparing for a long time and his trump card is unknown. We also know very little about that sea area. If we go head-to-head, the outcome is uncertain, but we must try to sue. Chian continued, her tone becoming firm for the sake of the innocent who might be affected by his madness and to prevent that profit-driven rule-breaking approach from becoming the master of this. Lynn Mo and Mo turned to look at her.</p>
<p>The girl&#x27;s profile appeared soft in the dim light from the top of the tower, but her eyes were clear and resolute. Having experienced the attack on their homeland, the long journey to provide aid, and the planning they had done together, she still retained her initial gentleness, but now possessed a resilience and decisiveness honed by trials and tribulations. Yuri Wright Lin Mo turned his gaze back to the north. It has not just about stopping him, but also about establishing another possibility. a possibility where cooperation is better than plunder, order is better than chaos, and bottom lines cannot be trampled on.</p>
<p>This path is difficult, but someone has to start walking it. Dot. He paused, his voice lowering. Moreover, I have a feeling that Caesar&#x27;s goal this time might not be as simple as power or resources. What&#x27;s on the seabed might be connected to a much larger secret about this world, about why we came here.</p>
<p>Su Chanhan shivered slightly. Not from the cold. You suspect it&#x27;s related to the civilization selection project. It has just a gut feeling that Lynn Mo shook his head. Mer mentioned that some key keys or nodes might be hidden in extreme environments.</p>
<p>The northeast anomaly region has unique energy and a harsh environment which fits the criteria. If Caesar has a force like the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood providing information, then his goal is very likely to touch the core of this world. The two fell into a brief silence with only the howling wind blowing by. &quot;Whatever it is,&quot; Lyno finally said, finishing the remaining ginger tea in the pot in one gulp. Feeling the heat spreading in his chest, &quot;It cannot fall into Caesar&#x27;s hands.</p>
<p>At least we cannot let him get it so easily.&quot; Dot. He turned to Su Xian and said, &quot;Go back and rest. The next few days will be the final preparation period. We need to be in top condition.&quot; Suchia nodded and followed him down from the top of the tower. Before parting, she suddenly stopped and whispered.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo, no matter what happens, I and everyone in Mo Yuan Pavilion will stand by your side. Lynn Mo paused slightly, turned back to look into her earnest eyes, and a slight stirring stirred within him. He reached out and gently grasped her slightly cold hand. &quot;I know,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Go to sleep, Dot.&quot; As night deepened, a chill spread to every corner of the island.</p>
<p>But beneath the tower that emitted a faint glow amidst the patrolling fire light, and in the hearts of everyone silently preparing for the approaching storm, something more resilient than the chill was quietly growing and coalescing. That was determination and also unwavering support. When the shadow of the ICC loomed, they became each other&#x27;s most reliable bullwork and beacon of light. Chapter 58. analysis of ice traces.</p>
<p>The trace metal residue collected by the Dragon Soul Outpost team was carefully sealed in a small bone box lined with lead foil and sent to Leeway along with a parchment scroll filled with instructions. For the next two days, Leeway practically locked himself in a specially cleaned and reinforced isolation analysis room at the bottom of the rune tower. This place, originally intended for the safe handling of dangerous energy materials, had now become a temporary microscopic analysis field. Dressed in multiple layers of protective gear and wearing goggles made from polished crystal plates and leather, he used the stable energy flow guided from the rune tower to power several intricate yet crude tools. A etched needle polish from the hard to see monster teeth.</p>
<p>An observation mirror that could magnify 30 times with lenses made of stacked crystals of different purities and a simple elemental tendency test panel that used temperature differences and energy conducting powder for development. The process was tedious and slow, requiring immense patience and absolute composure. The two apprentices could only stay in the outer room, responsible for recording and passing items, barely daring to breathe. On the morning of the third day, Lee Wai dragged his exhausted but excited body out of the isolation room, holding several pieces of fishkin paper covered with symbols and hastily drawn conclusions. It&#x27;s not any conventional alloy we know of.</p>
<p>His first words to Linmo were resounding. The structure of the residue is extremely unique. It wasn&#x27;t forged or cast. Rather, it seems to be a composite structure formed by the spontaneous arrangement and combination of several base metals under a specific energy environment through some kind of growth or deposition process. Lynn Emo took the fishkin paper.</p>
<p>Besides the text, it also contains sketches of strange yet regular microscopic structures observed under microscope. Can you figure out its purpose? Or is it related to those oddly patterned metal tubes of the Krampens? There a strong correlation. Leeway affirmed. Although the residue is too small to fully reproduce the macroscopic form, its crystal arrangement is similar to the control network of the bioengy hybrid crystal I analyzed before. In terms of energy guidance, both emphasize forced guidance and resonance under unnatural conditions.</p>
<p>I speculate that these metallic residues are likely peeled off from the surface of some larger device or component used to operate stably and transmit specific energy signals in extreme environments such as deep sea high pressure and low temperature. Those strange patterns may not be decorations, but rather some kind of energy circuit or resonance pattern. He took a breath and pointed to the complex formulas on another sheet of paper. More importantly, I detected an extremely faint but very stable trace of an energy inert coating in the residue. This coating can effectively resist metal embritment and energy dissipation under low temperature conditions.</p>
<p>This is not a technology we can easily develop at this stage of survival. There must be a force with more advanced materials science knowledge supporting Caesar. Then Montac frowned deeply. Technological gap. This was the most troublesome problem.</p>
<p>You could compensate for a numerical disadvantage with courage and wisdom, but lagging behind in basic materials and energy applications often meant absolute passivity on the battlefield. Can you deduce the composition or preparation principle of this coding? Even just a clue, Lynn Mo asked. Leeway smiled Riley and shook his head. It&#x27;s too difficult. The residual amount is too small, and the accuracy of the tower&#x27;s energy analysis is also limited.</p>
<p>I can only confirm that it contains a few rare mineral elements, but I have no clue about the specific proportions and synthesis process. It&#x27;s like seeing a piece of refined steel and knowing that it is 100 times stronger than pig iron, but not knowing how to build a blast furnace or how to control the temperature. Although he had expected it, Lynmo&#x27;s heart still sank slightly. However, he quickly composed himself. At least now they had a clearer understanding of the gap between them and one of Caesar&#x27;s strengths.</p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work, Leeway. Compile these analysis results into a report and raise the encryption level to the highest level. Also, try to design a simple device that can interfere with or pollute the resonant pattern of this metal based on its energy conduction properties. It doesn&#x27;t need to be completely destroyed. Even just causing a brief signal disturbance would be helpful.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll give a try. Leeway&#x27;s eyes rekindled with fighting spirit. As long as the principle is similar, there&#x27;s a possibility of interference. I need more data on that bio energy hybrid crystal. Go find Chan.</p>
<p>She has more detailed perception records. Leeway left in a hurry. Linmo carrying the report went to Chandwood&#x27;s place where she was rechecking the list of supplies. Chandu Duo had just finished a transaction with another group of fur merchants and was calculating the types and quantities of furs to be put into storage. Upon seeing Lynn Mo, he immediately put down what he was doing.</p>
<p>Boss, is there any news about Engineerly? Lynn Emmo handed him the report and briefly explained the situation. Chindwood was chubby face also turned serious. There&#x27;s definitely something fishy going on. I don&#x27;t know much about the technical aspects, but if that&#x27;s the case, the tools Caesar prepared this time are probably more professional and dangerous than we thought. Conventional sabotage methods may have limited effectiveness.</p>
<p>That s right lin mo n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n nodded. Therefore, our previous strategy needs to be slightly adjusted. Reconnaissance and intelligence gathering on the iceclaw base cannot stop, but the focus should be on figuring out the specific form, quantity, and potential weaknesses of their equipment. In addition, the warning messages UV been spreading through various channels can be made more detailed, such as according to ancient nautical charts, there is a sleeping steel behemoth beneath the icy seas of northeast China. Disturbing it rashly may lead to disaster to stir up the waters even more.</p>
<p>Dot Chi and Woodw&#x27;s eyes lit up. Understood. Mix the truth with the lies. Make him suspicious and distracted. I&#x27;ll get right on it.</p>
<p>Leaving the warehouse area, Linmo found Sue Chian and Sherhow on the beach who were instructing the special operations reserve team on ice water acclimatization training. The training ground was created by artificially splashing water and freezing it in a sheltered shallow bay. The temperature was extremely low and the team members wearing speciallymade thick rubber suits were practicing walking on the ice, icebreaking diving and the use of weapons in low temperature environments. Upon seeing Lin Mo, Sue Chian walked over. Her cheeks were slightly red from the cold wind, but she looked to be in good spirits.</p>
<p>Leeway s analysis report is out. Linmo told her the situation. It basically confirms our guess. Caesar possesses technology that surpasses the current general level and it is very likely from an organization that focuses on ancient relics or advanced knowledge. Such Chanchian took the report and quickly glanced at it, her brows furrowing slightly.</p>
<p>If he really wants to use these things to activate the seabed structure, the success rate of the energy inert coding deep sea equipment is indeed not low. She looked at the team members in the training field who were gritting their teeth and persevering in the icy water. What we can do is to deliver a fatal blow before he succeeds or when he is at his most vulnerable. Limo also looked at the team members. How&#x27;s the training going? It has tough but no one is backing down.</p>
<p>Dot sure how walked over exhaling a puff of white breath. They read all promising talents. The low temperature takes a huge toll on their physical strength and their movements become distorted. Weary working hard to help them develop muscle memory. They were also getting used to the new equipment that engineerly provided, but there aren&#x27;t enough of them yet.</p>
<p>Dot. Prepare as best you can. Lynn Mo patted his shoulder. By the way, Chian, what about your senses? Have you noticed any new changes in the ocean lately? Sue Chanchian closed her eyes, stood still for a moment, and carefully sensed it. The restlessness is continuing to increase, and the area is also expanding.</p>
<p>Many fish that originally lived in warmer waters are migrating to deeper or more southerntherly directions and the gaps they leave behind are being filled by some coldresistant and more aggressive species. In addition, I can feel that the pressure in the deep water layer to the northeast is changing with a feeling of being slowly emptied and filled, which is very subtle but not normal. Emptying and then filling. Then Mo pondered, &quot;It&#x27;s like some kind of large-scale periodic energy exchange or material cycle. It has somewhat similar but more deliberate.&quot; Sue Chanchian search for the right words.</p>
<p>Natural ocean currents and energy cycles. Dante give me this feeling. It s like there a huge dormant pump that s being tried and started up extremely slowly. Dot. This analogy sent a chill down the spines of both Lynn Mo and Sherhow.</p>
<p>If there really was a huge activatable device on the seabed, the energy it contained and the potential consequences would far exceed that of a cold wave itself. Continue monitoring and notify us immediately of any abnormalities, Linmo said in a deep voice. We are getting closer and closer to Caesar&#x27;s possible window of opportunity. A cold wind swept across the training field, carrying ice shards that stung people&#x27;s faces. But the shouts and the sounds of ice breaking grew louder and louder, conveying a resolute determination to fight to the death.</p>
<p>In the far north, the lights at the Iceclaw base may also burn all night. And on the island of Mo Yuan Pavilion, every preparation, every training session, every vigilant gaze is accumulating strength and conviction for the impending clash. The shadows beneath the icy sea grow ever darker. While on the ice, the roles of hunter and prey may only be truly revealed at the moment of their confrontation. Chapter 59.</p>
<p>The cry of the IC. On the evening of the third day, after Leeway locked himself in the rune tower, the door to the isolation analysis room finally opened again. He emerged looking even more disheveled than before. His hair a tangled mess, his eyes sunken, and his lips chapped from dehydration. Yet behind his thick crystal lenses, his eyes burned with an almost obsessive excitement.</p>
<p>In his hand, instead of fish paper, he held a palm-sized dark gray metal disc covered with fine engravings. Linmo was discussing the final stage of the special operations reserve team&#x27;s training plan with Sher How and Su Chanchian when they saw Leewi&#x27;s appearance and stopped talking. Leewi, you su Chian looked at him with some concern. I&#x27;m fine, just a little sleep-deprived. Leewi&#x27;s voice was horsearo, but it was filled with barely suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>Boss, look at this. He carefully placed a metal disc on the table. The disc looks unremarkable, as if it were roughly cast and polished from some kind of alloy. The engravings on its surface vary in depth and seem to be arranged randomly. However, upon closer inspection, one can see that the bottom of the engravings is filled with extremely fine, slightly darker color material.</p>
<p>This is Lynn Mo and Mo examined it carefully based on the energy guiding characteristics of that metal residue. I designed a prototype of a resonance contaminant. Leeway almost danced with excitement. The principle is very simple. It does not emit strong signals itself.</p>
<p>But when it detects a highintensity resonant wave in a specific frequency band that is of the same origin as the energy characteristics of that metal, it automatically excites several preset chaotic resonant modules inside, releasing a very short but highly disordered interference ripple into the surrounding space. He pointed to several inconspicuous small indentations in the center of the disc. These are filled with a response medium that I&#x27;m modulated using blue veneer powder and several energy conducting minerals. Once the target resonance is sensed, it will be activated. The surrounding grooves are energy conducting circuits.</p>
<p>Although rough, they are enough to diffuse the chaotic fluctuations. I estimate the effective range to be at most 10 to 15 m in radius. And the duration may only be two or three seconds, but as long as we can seize the critical moment, it can disrupt the normal operation of the Caesar equipment, even if only for a brief moment. Lynn Mo continued, a glint of light in his eyes. Even if it is just causing a critical command transmission to fail or causing a precision device to malfunction briefly, it could create an opportunity.</p>
<p>Dot. Yes, that&#x27;s exactly what I mean. libei. Moreover, this thing has extremely low energy consumption. It can maintain standby by relying on the meager environmental energy it stores.</p>
<p>It only consumes energy from the response medium when it is triggered. After being triggered, it needs to be recharged and the medium replaced before it can be used again. It is a disposable item, but the production cost is not high. Sherhow picked up the disc, weigh it in his hand, and examined the engravings closely. How do you use this? You can&#x27;t exactly swim to the bottom of the other ship and stick it on, can you? There are two uses that Leeway had clearly already considered it.</p>
<p>One is delivery. We&#x27;ll l make a waterproof shell and find a way to throw or place it near the target. For example, by firing it with a crossbow or having it carried and placed by a diver. The other is prepositioned. If we can predict Caesar s movement path or key operational points in advance, we can preposition them on the seabed just like mines waiting to be triggered.</p>
<p>What are the triggering conditions? How can we ensure that it only interferes with Caesar&#x27;s equipment and doesn&#x27;t affect us? Su Chian asked the crucial question. Lewi pushed up his glasses. This is where Chian&#x27;s help comes in. I need more detailed energy signature data for that metal, especially its resonant characteristic spectrum in the active state. The response medium in the disk needs to be fine-tuned based on the signature to improve the recognition accuracy.</p>
<p>Although it can&#x27;t be 100% accurate. As long as the signature data is accurate enough, the probability of falsely triggering our own equipment is very low. Our equipment&#x27;s energy characteristics are completely different from its. Su Chanchian immediately nodded. I&#x27;ll go and organize all the relevant data I&#x27;ve sensed recently, including that feeling of being deliberately activated, which is very likely the state when the target device is activated.</p>
<p>Great. The sooner the better. With the data, I can start adjusting the medium formula and groove optimization tonight, and I should be able to make a few test versions tomorrow. Leeway rubbed his hands together, wishing he could immediately crawl back to the lab. Lynn Mo looked at the inconspicuous gray disc on the table.</p>
<p>a glimmer of hope rising in his heart. The technological gap was difficult to overcome, but this targeted compact jamming device might truly play a crucial role at a critical moment. Leeway prioritize your research and testing. If you need any materials or manpower, just contact Shin Duo Duo directly. Linmo made the decision.</p>
<p>Sure, how select a few of the most meticulous team members to start learning how to use this thing and its deployment techniques. Once the test version is released, we&#x27;ll conduct simulation exercises. Clear, Chansen. Remember to rest after you finish organizing the data. Your perception is our most important early warning system, and we can&#x27;t overwork it.</p>
<p>Everyone accepted the order and left. Lynn and Mo remained alone in the council hall, his fingers unconsciously tapping the table as he pondered his next move. At that moment, Chin Doo, shivering with cold, pushed open the door and entered, holding a thin bamboo tube sealed with ceiling wax. Boss, Dragon Souls, urgent communication has just come through the secret passage. Lenmo took the bamboo tube, crushed the ceiling wax, and pulled out the parchment scroll inside.</p>
<p>It contained encrypted text handwritten by Xiao Ji Gang. The handwriting slightly hasty, clearly written in a hurry. Your Excellency Lin Mo, our longwave number four observation point lost contact 6 hours ago. The last message it transmitted mentioned an abnormal energy gathering in the direction of ice claws and it appears that several large ships have left port and are heading northeast. In addition, our reconnaissance boats dispatched to the outskirts of the broken ice zone reported that the movement of sea ice in that area has intensified abnormally and three unidentified large shadowy movements have been observed underwater.</p>
<p>Their shapes are difficult to discern and they appear to be guided. Caesar may have already begun his operation. Our department has activated a level two response and three rapid response fleets are on route to the designated interception area. We hope that your side will be on high alert and make preparations for cooperation as agreed. Xiao Ji Gang, has it finally begun? Lyn Mos eyes were cold as he looked at the intelligence report.</p>
<p>Caesar had indeed chosen to act during this window of opportunity before the energy disturbances vanguard had passed and the full-blown cold wave had arrived. Moreover, he had deployed unidentified underwater forces. He immediately got up and went to the observation platform at the top of the rune tower. Lewwayi had already gone back to a justice jammer. Only Such Chian was there.</p>
<p>She was standing with her eyes closed next to the central array, her hands lightly resting on the stone platform engraved with energy conducting patterns, her expression focused and solemn. Chian, according to Dragon Soul intelligence, Caesar&#x27;s fleet may have left port heading northeast. In addition, a large unidentified underwater shadow under guidance has been discovered in the Broken Eye Zone. Lynn Emmo briefly informed. Su Chanchian didn&#x27;t open her eyes, but her brows were clearly furrowed.</p>
<p>Her senses, like the most sensitive tentacles, stretched out with all their might in the northeast direction. After about 15 minutes, she slowly opened her eyes, find beads of sweat appearing on her forehead. The feeling of pressure changes in the deep sea has intensified that her voice trembled slightly. It act as like that giant pump has been given a sudden push and started running faster. There are many chaotic streams of energy being drawn in from all directions and filled into some kind of cavity.</p>
<p>The direction is indeed at the core of the northeast anomaly area dot. She paused, took a deep breath, and said, &quot;Moreover, I sense more than one guiding force. Besides that cold, deliberate signal like that emitted by a metal device, there was also a more ancient and more heavy fluctuation that was faintly echoing beneath that sea. I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but it gave me a very bad feeling, a very oppressive one. An ancient and heavy fluctuation.</p>
<p>Alarm bells rang in Lin Montake mind. This was beyond anything he had anticipated. Could there be something else on that seabed besides the device Caesar wanted to activate? or perhaps some inherent characteristic of the device itself. Can you determine the approximate location and size of Caesar&#x27;s fleet? Linmo asked. Sue Chian shook her head.</p>
<p>The distance is too far and there are complex energy disturbance zones in between. My perception is not penetrating enough. I can only vaguely sense that there&#x27;s a large amount of dense, unnatural metallic energy reaction moving in the northeast direction, and it is not small in scale. That&#x27;s enough. Lynn Emmo turned to the messenger standing at the foot of the tower and said, &quot;Order.</p>
<p>The entire island is on high alert. Recall all outer patrol vessels. Notify Captain Shirhow that the special operations reserve team has completed its final preparations and is ready to be deployed at any time. Notify manager Chin Duo Duo to activate all intelligence lines and obtain real-time information on the Iceclaw fleet at all costs. Notify supervisor Lee way to accelerate the jammer testing.</p>
<p>I need to see a usable product within 12 hours. Yes. The command was like a pebble thrown into calm water creating ripples. The quiet island was instantly brought to life. Brightly lit, bustling with people and filled with the sounds of commands, footsteps, and the movement of machinery.</p>
<p>The air was thick with the tension of an impending battle. Lynn Emmo walked to the edge of the tower, gazing at the inky black horizon to the north. A biting wind blew, carrying tiny ice crystals that stung his face. The blade is drawn. The icy sea is about to roar.</p>
<p>Hunter and Prey are about to clash decisively amidst the raging energy and frigid cold. And he, the king of storms, will lead his ships and cities to confront this sweeping cold wave and conspiracy. Chapter 60. looking northwards at the cold front. The order to be on high alert was like ice water poured into boiling oil, instantly setting the entire Muan Pavilion Island ablaze.</p>
<p>Yet under tight organization, it quickly returned to a somber and efficient order. Sure, how was the first to report before dawn. His eyes were bloodshot from staying up all night, but his voice was steady and strong. The Mo Yuan has completed all its cold weather modifications and final checks. It is fully loaded with supplies and ammunition, and all crew members are in place and ready to set sail at any time.</p>
<p>The special operations reserve team is on standby 24 hours a day. The simulation exercises for jamming device deployment and underwater assault have been completed one last time. Although the equipment is rudimentary, the procedures are already familiar. In addition, as you requested, the other two modified Fast Sentry ships, the Flying Fish and the Breaking Waves, are also ready and can be used for reconnaissance and vanguard missions. Lynamo stood by the window of the inner fortress council hall.</p>
<p>Gazing at the leaden sky and the sparse snowflakes that have begun to fall. How are the crew and soldiers? The low temperature is the biggest enemy. Morale is high. Everyone knows what this battle is about. Sherhow replied, &quot;We&#x27;ve been provided with the highest standards of warm clothing and cabin heating, and each person has been given extra high calorie oil and dried meat.</p>
<p>The simple heaters provided by engineer we have also been placed in key locations on a ship. But to be honest, boss, if we really have to fight for a long time in those anticipated harsh sea conditions, it will be a huge test of our physical strength and willpower. I know Lyno turn around. So we can&#x27;t he passively wait for the cold wave to fully arrive or wait for Caesar to finish doing everything he wants. We must actively choose the battlefield and the timing dot.</p>
<p>At that moment, Chi and Duo Duo practically slid into the council hall, his thick fur coat covered in snowflakes, but his chubby face glowed with excitement. Boss, breaking news. Gray Rat and Ice Shard risked their lives to deliver it. He barely had time to catch his breath before he blurted out, &quot;Caesar s main fleet. A total of 23 large and medium-sized warships all departed from Iceclaw late last night.&quot; 15 of them are standard blood sharkass battleships.</p>
<p>Five are tugboats equipped with high-powered winches and cranes, and three are very strange. They are low and wide with their holes almost touching the waterline and very few structures on their decks. But they have a very deep draft, like their bellies are full of stones. I shard risked getting close to take a look and said that the holes of those three strange ships are a very dark color as if they have been coated with something special and they make almost no splashing sound when they move. Lows slung wide deep draft and silently navigating Lin Mo and Shurehow exchanged a glance both thinking of the unidentified large underwater shadow mentioned in the dragon soul intelligence.</p>
<p>Could those three be the mother ship of some kind of underwater or semi-submersible vessel? Or perhaps they were special underwater operation platforms themselves? Anything else? Then Mont presset. After the fleet left port, it split into three groups. Chin Duo Duo continued, &quot;The first echelon consisting of 10 blood sharks and the three strange ships headed straight for the northeast. The remaining blood sharks and five tugboats formed the second echelon, following at a certain distance. In addition, the remaining ships and personnel left behind at Iceclaw have strengthened their vigilance, but they seem to be more like those who stay behind to provide support.</p>
<p>Webe split up sure help pondered. The first echelon is the real core, carrying those mysterious devices and possible underwater forces heading straight for the target. The second echelon is for support and backup and may also be in preparation for possible interception. Dot. Where is Caesar himself? Which team is he on? Lynn Mo asked.</p>
<p>Shin Duo Duo shook his head. I didn&#x27;t see it clearly, but Grey Rat guesses that given Caesar&#x27;s personality, he is very likely on one of those three strange ships in the first echelon, personally commanding the most crucial part. Linmo walked to the huge nautical chart, his gaze fixed on the northeast. Where is Dragon Souls rapid response fleet? According to the last encrypted communication, their three fleets have arrived at the outer perimeter of the designated interception area and are establishing a defensive line and reconnaissance network. However, Captain Xiao also mentioned that the sea conditions are rapidly deteriorating, visibility is very low, and there&#x27;s an increase in floating ice which greatly reduces the effectiveness of reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Chian Duo Duo replied. Just then, Su Chanchian and Leewi walked in together. Su Chians face was a little pale, but her eyes were bright. Leewi was carrying a wooden box containing a dozen or so dark gray metal discs, which were an improved version of the resonance contaminant. Chian, you go first, Linmo gestured.</p>
<p>The changes in the pressure in the deep sea are becoming more and more obvious. Sue Chanchan spoke a little quickly. The speed at which energy is being drawn out is accelerating and that cavity seems to be being filled rapidly. Moreover, that ancient and heavy fluctuation is becoming clearer. It doesn&#x27;t tease seem to exist passively, but rather it is responding to this energy filling process.</p>
<p>It gives me a very ominous feeling as if something that has been dormant for a long time is being awakened. Awakened. Lyn Mo&#x27;s heart sank. This was worse than he had expected. activating a device.</p>
<p>Leeway continued, &quot;The jammer has been adjusted based on the energy signature data provided by Chanchian, so the recognition accuracy should be improved. I made 16 finished products. The jamming duration after triggering is about 3 to 5 seconds with an effective radius of about 10 m. The outer shell has been waterproofed and pressure resistant, so theoretically it can work at a depth of 100 m for a short time. There are two ways to use it.</p>
<p>One is to use a special crossbow to fire it, replacing the arrow head with this. It will be triggered when it hits a hard object or receives a specific frequency signal. The other is to set it manually, which is carried and placed by the diver. It can be set with a delay or remote triggering, but the remote triggering distance is very short, not exceeding 50 m. He handed a disc to Lenmo.</p>
<p>It felt heavy in his hand, and the outer casing was cool to the touch. Is a remote control signal also based on resonance? Lynn Mo asked. Yes, but we use different codes to prevent the jammer from being accidentally triggered by itself. That leeway nodded. However, all of this is theoretical and has not been tested in actual combat.</p>
<p>The pressure, temperature, and energy interference in the deep sea environment may affect the actual effect. Being prepared is better than being unprepared. Lynn Mo placed the disc back into the wooden box. Leeway, you and your apprentice will remain at the Rune Tower, responsible for monitoring energy changes and maintaining data communication with the Dragon Soul. If there are any sudden changes in the energy characteristics of a Caesar device or that ancient fluctuation, notify us immediately.</p>
<p>Dot. Clear. Lin Mo&#x27;s gaze swept over the people in the council hall. The composure how the shrewdian duo duo, the resilient suian, and the focusly way. These were his most reliable companions along the way.</p>
<p>Time waits for no one. Caesar&#x27;s fleet has already set sail. Limo&#x27;s voice was calm and firm. We can&#x27;t wait any longer. Sure.</p>
<p>How? Order the mo you on flying fish and wave breaker to weigh anchor and set sail in 1 hour. Target the dragon souls preset interception area to the northeast. We won&#x27;t confront Caesar&#x27;s main force head-on. will be like a nail wedged into his operational chain, looking for opportunities to disrupt his key steps. The special operations reserve team will accompany the MOU on Chin Duo Duo.</p>
<p>The island&#x27;s defense and rear coordination are your responsibility. Maintain smooth communication with the Dragon Soul, especially regarding those three strange ships and any underwater forces. Chan, you&#x27;re setting off with us. Your senses are our most sensitive eyes. Everyone looked solemn and replied in unison, &quot;Yes.&quot; An hour later, the massive Mo Yuan slowly sailed away from the warm harbor, plunging into the swirling snowflakes and increasingly turbulent gray waves.</p>
<p>Flying fish and wave breaker stood guard on either side like two agile swordfish. On the dock, Chandu Duo wrapped his fur coat tighter around himself, watching the ship&#x27;s silhouette gradually disappear into the distance. His usual smug smile was gone from his chubby face, replaced by a deep, somber expression. He turned and roared at his assistants. &quot;Everyone stay alert.</p>
<p>The boss and the others are risking their lives up front. We need to keep a close watch on the house. Double the patrols. Keep a close watch on the communication lines. Report even a suspicious seabird flying by.&quot; The cold wind held and the snow fell heavier and heavier.</p>
<p>The island gradually blurred behind us. eventually disappearing into the vast white expanse between the sea and the sky. On the bridge of the Mo Yuan, Lynn Emmo stood against the wind, the icy seawater and snowflakes lashing his face. He gazed northward at the source of the restless energy, the target of Caesar&#x27;s ambition and the core of the unknown in danger. Such Chian stood beside him and gently took his cold hand.</p>
<p>No matter what&#x27;s down there, her voice was still clear in the wind. We&#x27;ll face it together. Lynmo gripped her hand tightly in return and nodded. Inside the cabin, special forces soldiers conducted a final check of their equipment, exchanging tactical details in hush tones. On deck, sailors brave the wind and snow, firmly gripping the sails and rudder.</p>
<p>The anti-cold grease produced by Rune Tower gleamed faintly at the mechanical joints, and makeshift heaters radiated limited but precious heat beside their key posts. The bow cleaved through the increasingly viscous seawater which was beginning to contain small ice flows and resolutely sailed towards the icy sea that was being shrouded by both the cold wave and ambition. The storm king&#x27;s fleet is now unshaded. Their target, the northern edge chapter 61, first encounter in the frozen sea. The mo yuan navigated through increasingly dense ice flows like a giant whale swimming on a shattered mirror.</p>
<p>The anti- cold grease and hole seals modified by Leeway proved effective, although the speed was reduced due to the need to constantly avoid ice. The ship maintained good maneuverability and water tightness. However, the environment was extremely harsh. The sky was oppressive lead and gray, and heavy snow was whipped into a white curtain by the gale, reducing visibility to less than 100 m. The temperature had dropped to the point where breath frosted and seaater splashed onto the deck quickly froze in a thin ice.</p>
<p>The sailors had to take turns using speciallymade wooden mallets and scrapers to promptly clear the ice from the hole. Ropes and deck to prevent the ship from losing balance or equipment from freezing and malfunctioning. Linmo and Sue Chanchan stood inside the bridge, a relatively enclosed space. A thick transparent crystal observation window made from polished and pieced together natural crystal had been installed in front of them, and heat from a heater was piped in to maintain a tolerable temperature. Such Chian&#x27;s face was even paler than on the island.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, trying her best to extend her senses outward, but her brows remained furoughed. The interference is too strong. She opened her eyes, her voice weary. The wind and snow, the floating ice, and the increasingly chaotic energy field of this sea area. My perception is like being stuck in a quagmire, unable to reach far or discern details.</p>
<p>I can only vaguely sense a large scale energy gathering and disturbance in the northeast, as well as many scattered aggressive life forms moving toward us. Tha, &quot;Is it a sea monster?&quot; sure how asked, his shoulders covered in unmelted snow after he had just returned from inspecting the lower cabins. Yes, they were attracted here. Not on the scale of a beast tide, more like scattered soldiers were disturbed or driven away. Sue, Chanchia nodded, but there are quite a few of them, and they&#x27;re very frenzy.</p>
<p>As if to confirm her words, about 300 m to her left, next to a large ice flow, the sea suddenly exploded. A frostblade shark over four meters long with a mouth full of interlocking fangs leaped out and slammed into the ice flow, shattering it before crashing back into the sea, stirring up turbid waves. It seemed not to have noticed the MOU on but was simply venting its unchecked rage. &quot;It&#x27;s a frostblade shark, which usually only lives in the coldest, deepest waters and is extremely aggressive,&quot; Suchian said softly. &quot;Even they&#x27;ve been affected by this shallow water.</p>
<p>Everyone increase vigilance. Watch out underwater and behind the ice flows. Sherhow immediately issued the order to the entire ship through the walkie-talkie. The crossbowmen took their positions and the archers and javelin throwers also increased their patrols along the ship sides. The convoy continued its arduous journey northeast.</p>
<p>After sailing for about two more hours, the flying fish acting as a scout ahead suddenly sent back urgent light signals identified vessel spotted. Lyn Emmo immediately raised his binoculars through the swirling snow. He could barely make out masts and sails swaying in the gaps between several massive icebergs to his left, suggesting there was more than one vessel. Slow down and maintain distance. Flying fish and wave breaker flank and scout to the sides and take cover, Linmo ordered.</p>
<p>VMO Yuan slowly came to a stop using the shadow of an iceberg to temporarily conceal its massive body. Such Chan Chan focused her mind again, and after a moment, she whispered, &quot;They&#x27;re ships.&quot; Three. No, for medium-sized sailing ships. The energy signature of the wings of freedom carries a plundering aura, but they don&#x27;t feel like the main force. They seem more like a reconnaissance or perimeter patrol formation.</p>
<p>Caesar s tentacles have stretched far enough. Sure, how sneered. He has already set up outer outposts, even though weary still quite a distance from the dragon&#x27;s soulless interception zone. and the core of the anomaly area. Take them down? A young first mate asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Then Emmo pondered. Taking down these reconnaissance ships wouldn&#x27;t be difficult, but might immediately expose their position and strength, alerting Caesar&#x27;s main force. If they didn&#x27;t attack, the enemy might already have discovered them or very soon. Are there any signs that they&#x27;re coming this way? Lyn Emmo asked. Such Chanchian sensed carefully.</p>
<p>Not yet. They seem to be patrolling, moving back and forth along a fixed route as if they are blocking this waterway leading to the northeast. Blockade the shipping lanes. Lyno looked at the nautical chart. This area was one of the few relatively safe shipping lanes leading to the core of the anomaly with icebergs and reefs densely packed on both sides, making it indeed suitable for setting up a blockade.</p>
<p>Caesar doesn&#x27;t te want anyone to disturb his good time. Lin Mo concluded, &quot;These ships are just watchdogs. If we go around them, we might run into other blockades or waste more time. Besides, keeping them around will expose our whereabouts sooner or later. Dot.</p>
<p>His eyes turn cold. Since we can&#x27;t avoid it, let&#x27;s finish this quickly. Try to eliminate them without alerting the enemy in the distance. Sure, how devise a boarding action plan. Be fast and quiet.</p>
<p>Use ballisti to damage their rudders and sails. Force them to stop and then board them. Try to capture them alive. We need intelligence. Understood.</p>
<p>A fierce glint flashed in Shure House&#x27;s eyes, and he immediately began to make arrangements. The Mo Yuon, like a slithering sea monster, stealthily made its way to the flank and rear of the patrol fleet under the cover of the iceberg. The two fast ships, flying fish and breaking waves, darted out like arrows from a greater flank. The wind, snow, and ice flows provided excellent cover. It wasn&#x27;t until the massive shadow of the Mo Yuan appeared less than 200 meters behind the four wings of freedom patrol boats that the enemy lookouts sounded the alarm in alarm, but it was too late.</p>
<p>The four heavy ballisti on the starboard side of the MO Yuan simultaneously emitted a muffled thud. Speciallymade grappling hook arrows with barbs and ropes tore through the wind and snow, accurately striking the stern rudders and main sail mass of the two nearest enemy ships. Snap! With chips flew everywhere, and the sails snapped. The two enemy ships instantly lost most of their power and control and spun sideways on the sea. Almost simultaneously, the flying fish and the wave breaker suddenly charged out from the left and right sides.</p>
<p>their light rams slamming into the sides of two other enemy ships that were trying to turn or escape. Although they did not cause serious damage, they successfully delayed their movements. Bart sure how gave the order and several grappling hooks and gang planks were lowered from the side of the Mo Yuon ship. The special forces members and elite sailors who were already prepared swept across the cold sea like tigers descending a mountain and pounced on the two heavily damaged enemy ships. Ziao Tai and Lu Fong each led a team, and their movements were swift and decisive.</p>
<p>The battle erupted suddenly and fiercely, but ended just as quickly. The wings of Freedom&#x27;s patrol fleet clearly hadn&#x27;t anticipated encountering an enemy of such size and strength, much less the decisiveness and ruthlessness of their attack. The two crippled ships were quickly brought under control, and the sailors resisting on deck were either subdued or forced into the sea. The other two ships, though attempting to fight back and escape, were also quickly boarded under the sustained threat of the Inc. Abyss&#x27;s Ballisty and the close quarters combat of the Flying Fish and Wavebreaker.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, all four enemy ships sank. The Mo Yuan Pavilion side suffered only a few minor injuries. Some debris and corpses floated on the sea, quickly covered by ice flows and snowflakes. Sherhow personally interrogated several of the captured leaders. Their testimonies confirmed his earlier suspicions.</p>
<p>They were indeed an outer patrol sent by Caesar tasked with blocking the waterway and intercepting any ships attempting to approach the northeast, especially Dragon Souls reconnaissance forces. They belonged to the second echelon&#x27;s rear guard and knew very little about the first echelon&#x27;s specific mission and location, only that the adults had taken the divine artifact deeper into the water to open the great gate. Lyn Mo pondered the word door, his ominous premonition growing stronger. They also mentioned that in the past 2 days, the sea creatures in this area have suddenly become more aggressive and they have already lost several small boats. Sherhow added, &quot;This should be the result of the combined effects of residual pherommones and energy disturbances.</p>
<p>Deal with the prisoners, collect useful supplies, tow the ship behind the iceberg, and hide it. Prepare for it to sink,&quot; Lin and Mo ordered. &quot;We can&#x27;t carry any burdens, nor can we leave any obvious traces.&quot; After clearing the battlefield, the fleet set sail again. Although the encounter went smoothly, it served as a wake-up call for everyone. Caesar&#x27;s blockade was more stringent than anticipated, and the closer they got to his core area, the greater the resistance they would encounter.</p>
<p>The wind and snow continued, and visibility showed no improvement. The Mo Yuan continued its journey northeastward along a relatively safe gap marked on the newly captured nautical chart. Suchians senses remained highly alert. She had to be wary of potential sea monsters and enemy ships while also trying to penetrate the chaotic energy field to search for the ancient fluctuations and the trail of Caesar&#x27;s main force. Lynn and Mo stood before the observation window, gazing at the vast, white, and perilous world outside.</p>
<p>The first battle was a victory, but it was merely a trivial opening act in this icy struggle. The real challenge lies beneath the surface of the deep sea, shrouded in blizzards and unknown energies. He must lead his ship and crew through it all to find that crucial point. A point that might determine the fate of countless people. Chapter 62.</p>
<p>The shadow of deep dive. After clearing away the remnants of a skirmish, the Mo Yuan fleet continued its journey northeastward into the sea shrouded in energy and mystery amidst the increasingly violent blizzard. The speed of the voyage had to be reduced again. The ice flows on the sea were no longer scattered fragments, but large jagged ice flows, some even comparable to small reefs. The seawater had become viscous and murky, its color and ominous dark gray green with a layer of fine ice crystals floating on the surface.</p>
<p>The sky seemed to be perpetually covered by thick, letting gray clouds, the sunlight dim, making it impossible to distinguish between day and dusk. Only the gale, whipping up snow and ice shards, howled endlessly, lashing the hall and emitting a shrill cry like the whales of a vengeful ghost. The temperature inside the bridge had dropped to a level that required wearing all thick clothing to endure, even with the heating pipes. A thick layer of frost had formed on the observation windows, requiring constant scraping with a special scraper to clear away small patches of ice. Linmo, Sue Chian, and Shurehow took turns guarding the windows, struggling to navigate the icy maze with only their naked eyes and the limited field of vision of their telescopes.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian bore the heaviest burden, she maintained a near constant state of heightened awareness, like a faint lantern flickering in a blizzard, striving to penetrate both physical and energetic barriers to provide early warnings for the fleet. Her complexion worsened, shadows deepened under her eyes, and she would occasionally tremble slightly uncontrollably, a sign of excessive mental strain. Lyn Mo urged her to rest several times. But she simply shook her head, drank some heated sugar salt water, and closed her eyes again. Straight ahead, 15° to the right, about 500 meters away, there&#x27;s a large group of reefs underwater, extending over a wide area.</p>
<p>We must detour that her voice was tired and horsearo. The detour route to the left is relatively clean, but I feel there is something beneath that area of water. It has not a reef. It has a living thing. It has very large.</p>
<p>Its energy response is very low. It is almost blending into the environment and it s moving slowly. Dot a sea monster sure how immediately became alert. Unlike the common types, the energy characteristics are ancient and dull, as if it has been dormant for many years and has just been disturbed by something. Sue Chanchian described her feeling.</p>
<p>It did not show any aggression, more like sleepwalking or rather being unconsciously drawn by some deeper calling. Dot. Lynn Mo noted the location and ordered the helmsmen to adjust the course, moving as far away from the suspicious waters as possible. He also instructed Shure how to notify the entire ship to maintain the highest level of silence and vigilance when passing through the area. The fleet carefully navigated around the reefs and the waters where the unknown behemoth slumbered.</p>
<p>As the massive hull of the Mo Yuan glided past an iceberg resembling the fangs of a giant beast, Linmo through the newly cleared observation window seemed to glimpse an enormous indistinct shadow slowly sinking into the deeper darkness of a deep green sea below. There were no large waves, only a string of huge, slowly rising bubbles that condensed into tiny ice beads the instant they touched the cold surface. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, but the gloom in their hearts grew even heavier. This area concealed more and more strange things than they had imagined. After sailing for another 2 hours, Su Chian suddenly shuddered, opened her eyes abruptly, and her face drained of color.</p>
<p>Then, Montac, her voice trembled slightly with urgency. That ancient and heavy fluctuation has changed. It&#x27;s accelerating and I sensed a large amount of dense metallic energy reaction right to our northeast about 30 to 40 nautical miles away. It&#x27;s Caesar&#x27;s main fleet. They&#x27;ve stopped.</p>
<p>No, not stopped. They&#x27;re operating. Those metallic reactions are making a deep connection with some point on the seabed. They were finally getting close. Lin Mo&#x27;s spirits lifted, but then Su Chanchian&#x27;s next words tighten his heart.</p>
<p>And that feeling of being guided is even stronger now. Not only the giant creature we just bypassed, but also many other deep sea creatures of varying sizes are gathering towards that core point. It has not a frenzied attack, but more like being attracted summoned to go somewhere. Sue Chanchian pressed her forehead, seemingly enduring some discomfort. What Caesar wants to open that door may not just be some kind of device he has trying to communicate or awaken something deeper something closely connected to the ancient history of this ocean awaken him sure how&#x27;s face was ashen has he gone mad in a place like this at this time for him this might be the perfect opportunity Lynn Emmo calmly analyzed the intense energy disturbances are masking the anomalies the impending cold wave is hindering intervention from other forces and he happens to possess the key and technology he obtained from somewhere.</p>
<p>He looked at Sue Chanchian. Can you roughly assess the depth of their operation and how long it might take? Sue Chian tried to concentrate and after a moment shook her head. It&#x27;s too far away. The interference is too strong. I can only feel the connection deepening and the energy exchange intensifying.</p>
<p>The acceleration of that ancient fluctuation is very obvious. Like a rusty giant will being forcibly pushed faster and faster. I don&#x27;t know what it will be like when it&#x27;s fully spinning. They had to get close as quickly as possible. They had to interfere with or even stop them.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo knew that time was flying by. Full speed ahead. Follow the safe path you&#x27;ve sensed and approach the target area as quickly as possible. Lynn Mo ordered, &quot;Notify flying fish and wave breaker to maintain their alert formation and focus on preventing any unusual underwater creatures.&quot; The order was given, and the Mo Yuan&#x27;s propellers began to paddle with all their might. Again, the main sail adjusted to the optimal angle, carving a path through the wind, snow, and ice flows.</p>
<p>The increased speed brought greater turbulence and risk. The hull occasionally collided with smaller ice flows, producing dull thuds, but there was no time to worry about that now. After sailing for about an hour, the snowstorm ahead seemed to have thinned slightly and visibility improved to about 200 m. It was at this moment that Sue Chansen, who had been on high alert, suddenly pointed to the left front. There, something is rising from underwater.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s moving very fast. The energy reaction is Caesars&#x27;s. It feels like a mixture of metallic and bio energy, but more concentrated, more like a finished product. Everyone immediately looked over. About a 100 meters away.</p>
<p>The sea surface suddenly arched upwards, and a dark streamlined spindle-shaped object over 10 m long broke through the icy water, leaping several meters above the surface. Its entire body was covered in a dark, neither gold nor wood material with regularly distributed dark red light bands on its surface. Its head was cone-shaped, and its tail had a complex fin-like structure and a propeller. It hovered briefly in the air, seemingly scanning or locating its position. The dark red light bands flashed rapidly a few times before plunging back into the sea, barely splashing any water, leaving only a rapidly spreading ripple and a few wisps of lingering white steam.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a submersible, some kind of underwater vehicle. Sure, how gasped. Caesar even has this kind of thing. There&#x27;s more than one. Su Chanchian exclaimed urgently.</p>
<p>There are others nearby. They&#x27;re patrolling. The perimeter is very large. We&#x27;ve been discovered. Almost as soon as she finished speaking, another identical black submersible silently emerged from the shadow of an iceberg not far away on the starboard side of the a device on its head turning and pointing towards the.</p>
<p>Although there was no attack, the feeling of being locked on and chilling instantly spread throughout the entire ship. Lynmo&#x27;s eyes were sharp as knives. It seemed that Caesar&#x27;s door had not been fully opened yet, but the hounds guarding the gate had already bared their fangs. Don&#x27;t fire. Maintain course, but slow down.</p>
<p>Adopt a defensive but not offensive posture. Lynn Mo quickly ordered, &quot;Sure, how? Prepare for negotiation. signal the general distress call and the Mo Yuan pavilion&#x27;s identification flags. See if the master behind these hounds will show up. He wanted to take a gamble.</p>
<p>He was betting that Caesar wouldn&#x27;t want any unforeseen complications before achieving his ultimate goal, especially not a full-scale war prematurely with a storm king whose strength was unclear and who had just breached his outer defenses. The gamble was dangerous, but they needed time. They needed to get closer to the core and they needed to figure out the true nature of these hounds. The Mo Yuan moved slowly forward, especially made flags, representing negotiation, and Mo Yuan pavilion, rising on the main mast and fluttering violently in the gale. The two black submersibles followed like ghosts, neither too close nor too far, their dark red light bands shining steadily, maintaining a silent deterrent.</p>
<p>Above the icy sea, amidst the wind and snow, a suffocating silence of confrontation pervaded the air, and in the deeper depths of the sea, the accelerating rotation of the ancient waves seemed to be faintly audible. Chapter 63. Standoff at the icy sea. Like a lost whale stumbling into a giant&#x27;s lair, the Mo Yuan slowly sailed under the cold gaze of the black submersible. The wind and snow seemed to have wisely subsided a bit, and visibility remained at around 200 m, enough to make people see the two streamlined dark red cold glowing creations like a malignant tumor attached to the left and right flanks of the fleet.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t launch an attack, nor did they make any further deterrent moves. They simply maintained a fixed distance and orientation, their dark red light bands pulsating steadily, conveying a silent warning and surveillance. This silent oppressive feeling was more chilling than direct artillery fire. Inside the bridge, the air seemed to freeze. Linmo stood before the observation window, his gaze calmly sweeping over the two submersibles before turning to the snow-covered sea in the distance.</p>
<p>Such Chian leaned back, closing her eyes and trying to calm her overexerted mind, but her body still trembled slightly involuntarily. Shouse stood beside the communicator, his fingers unconsciously tapping on the cold metal casing, awaiting a response, or perhaps the next twist of fate. Time ticked by, each second feeling as if stretched out by the cold wind. The soldiers and sailors on deck gripped their weapons and ropes tightly, watching the sea and the shadows beneath with vigilance, their breath condensing into white mist in the frigid air. After this suffocating silence lasted for about 15 minutes, the dark red light band on the bow of one of the submersibles suddenly changed its flashing frequency, emitting a regular coded pulse.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the modified bassband communication crystal on the MOU on used to communicate with the Dragon Soul suddenly lit up faintly, emitting a crackling electrical noise. Then, a severely distorted voice, yet still discernable as arrogant and cold, forcefully cut in, unfamiliar ship, state your identity and a reason for your intrusion. The sound came directly from inside the bridge, indicating that the other side possessed some kind of powerful signal suppression and directional transmission technology. Lynmo and Sure How exchanged a glance. Sherhow stepped forward, adjusted the feedback channel on the communication crystal and replied in a deep voice, &quot;This is the storm sailboat Moan belonging to the Mo Yuan pavilion.</p>
<p>We are currently on a maritime patrol mission and have deviated from our course due to severe weather. What faction are you? Why are you intercepting us here? A brief silence followed, broken only by the crackling of electricity. Then the distorted voice rang out again, tinged with a barely perceptible mockery. Emo Yuan Pavilion. I&#x27;ve heard of Linmo, the Storm King, deviating from a course.</p>
<p>This frozen hell doesn&#x27;t seem like an ordinary cruising area. The other party clearly knew their identities and saw through their excuse immediately. Lyn Mo stopped beating around the bush and spoke directly to the communication crystal. Caesar, since you know it&#x27;s us, why hide? Have your little toy step aside and perhaps we can talk. A low chuckle came from the other end of the communication.</p>
<p>The distortion unable to conceal its arrogance. Limo, you are more daring and more foolish than I imagined. This is my hunting ground, and what is taking place is the sacred work before the great descent. I give you two choices. Turn around immediately and leave the sea area and I may pretend I didn&#x27;t see it or stay and become part of this great sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sacrifice? Lyn Mos eyes narrowed. This word brought his ominous premonition to its peak. Caesar, how much do you know about what lies beneath the sea? And what do you intend to do with it? Then Monta Pulbbit, the so-called great descent is probably not a domain for a plunderer like you plunderers. Uh-huh. Caesar&#x27;s laughter, amplified by the distortion, sounded particularly jarring.</p>
<p>The moral shackles of the old world are worthless here. Power is the only truth. What lies beneath the sea is the key to new power. It will grant me the authority to rule this sea and indeed the entire new world. As for you ants clinging to the past, either submit or perish.</p>
<p>Before the words were even finished, the communication was abruptly cut off. At the same time, the two submersibles that have been monitoring the situation suddenly increased the frequency of their flashing dark red lights. They began to accelerate, no longer maintaining distance, but like two venomous snakes lurking in weight, rapidly weaving and darting towards the bow and stern of the Moan. He&#x27;s about to make his move. Sure, how shouted.</p>
<p>All personnel, prepare for battle in the ballisti, watch the underwater. No, wait. Lynn and Mo raised his hand to stop Sher How from immediately ordering an attack. His gaze fixed on the movements of the two submersibles. He&#x27;s probing and he&#x27;s also driving us away.</p>
<p>Judging from their course, he&#x27;s trying to force us to change course or retreat rather than attacking directly. As expected, although the two submersibles were aggressive, they always maintained a safe distance from the MON. Their movements were more like drawing an invisible boundary, forcing the Mo Yuan to leave its current course and drift southwest. Suian struggled to her feet, pressing her fingers to her temples, enduring the discomfort as she extended her senses once more. He&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>The thing beneath the sea is accelerating its awakening. The energy flow is accelerating, and the core of that ancient fluctuation is becoming increasingly clear and aggressive. Caesar&#x27;s fleet has deployed a circular formation around the core area and those large metal devices are firing powerful energy beams into the seabed as if heating or stimulating a certain point. The deep sea creatures that have been attracted are gathering towards that point. But as soon as they get close to the energy beams, they disappear as if melted or absorbed.</p>
<p>Her description made the temperature on the bridge seemed to drop several degrees. Absorbing life energy, activating ancient beings. What terrifying ritual was Caesar performing? We cannot retreat. Lynn Mo&#x27;s voice was resolute, breaking the oppressive silence. The more he tries to drive us away, the more it shows he&#x27;s afraid of being disturbed, and that his sacred operation has reached a critical and vulnerable stage.</p>
<p>Sure, how order flying fish and wave breaker to spread out to the flanks, attract the submersible attention, and harass them, but don&#x27;t engage in a direct confrontation. Mo you on. Adjust your course and force your way through the gap in the Caesar fleet circular formation. Speed isn&#x27;t important, but stability is crucial. Adopt the posture of getting as close to the core as possible, no matter the cost.</p>
<p>Yes. A fierce glint flashed in Show&#x27;s eyes as he immediately relayed the order. The massive Mo Yuan emitted a deep rumble, its bough slightly adjusted, ignoring the two submersibles that were trying to force it to turn. Instead, it slowly but firmly pressed forward towards the gap they had deliberately left, leading to the core area. At the same time, the flying fish and the wave breaker, like two agile hunting dogs, suddenly accelerated from the flanks, maneuvering behind the two submersibles.</p>
<p>The ship&#x27;s light crossbows began to aim and fire. Although the accuracy was poor in the wind and waves, they successfully attracted the other side&#x27;s attention. This unexpectedly forceful action clearly startled the people operating the submersibles. The two submersibles paused briefly, seemingly communicating internally or requesting instructions. Then they abandoned their attempt to drive them away.</p>
<p>The dark red light suddenly became blinding and a baffle below the bow slid open, revealing a large, dark, gaping launch tube. They&#x27;re going to attack, the lookout screamed. Allisti, aim at the submersible launch tubes and power units. Intercept fire. Shh roared.</p>
<p>However, the anticipated torpedoes or energy beams did not fire. The submersible launch tubes merely flashed briefly before shutting down. They seemed to have received new orders, ceasing their attempt to directly intercept the MON and instead accelerating their retreat to create distance while maintaining surveillance. They withdrew. A first maid asked somewhat incredulous.</p>
<p>It s not a retreat. It s a change of strategy. Linmo mo stared at the two black shadows that quickly blended into the snowy background. Caesar doesn&#x27;t he want to start a full-scale war with us at this time and waste his strength. He has chosen a more prudent approach monitoring delaying letting us back down on our own or dealing with us at his leisure after he has finished his task.</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at Sue Chanchan. Can you sense the energy changes in the core area after a breakthrough? Such Chian focused her senses and after a moment a complex expression appeared on her face. The acceleration of that ancient fluctuation seems to have slowed down a little, very weak, but definitely there. Caesar&#x27;s energy beam emission also seems to have shown a slight unstable fluctuation. Our approach has indeed interfered with him.</p>
<p>Although it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s effective. Even the slightest disturbance is a glimmer of hope. Lenimo nodded. Keep moving forward. Stay vigilant.</p>
<p>Send our current location and encounters to the dragon soul, requesting them to exert pressure in this direction. We need to be like a thorn in Caesar&#x27;s throat, making every sacrifice he swallows painful. The mo yuan continued to break through the icy sea, resolutely heading towards the core area where energy surged and danger alert. The wind and snow intensified again and visibility decreased once more. But escorted by the two ghostly submersibles that followed them at a distance.</p>
<p>They knew they were approaching the final stage of this icy sea battle. In the deeper ocean, the ancient beings that were forcibly heated and stimulated seemed to have experienced a subtle deviation in their awakening process due to the unexpected intrusion of dust. Chapter 64. Ice crack. Under the watchful eye of the black submersible that seemed to accompany it like a ghost, the Mo Yuan continued its arduous advance towards the energy turbulent core area.</p>
<p>The wind and snow regained control, reducing visibility to less than 100 m. The sounds of the ship colliding with the ice flows grew more frequent and muffled. Each impact causing the ship to tremble slightly and ice shards to scatter like broken jade. The sailors took turns working more frequently. Their actions of clearing the ice almost mechanical, their eyebrows and eyelashes covered in frost, their breath quickly dissipating into the frigid air.</p>
<p>The atmosphere on the bridge was oppressive and focused. Lyn Moe&#x27;s gaze was mostly fixed on the two faint dark red shadows outside the observation window. Like leeches, they maintained a fixed distance and position, neither moving away nor getting closer, silently asserting their presence and surveillance. This feeling of being watched by venomous snakes was more mentally taxing than an open confrontation. Wrapped in a thick blanket, Su Chian sat in a corner near the heating ducks, forcing herself to engage in intermittent deep sensory perception.</p>
<p>She dared not exert her mental energy for extended periods with such intensity as before that would be tantamount to suicide. Instead, she would concentrate fully on listening for a few minutes every half hour or so, then immediately rest and recover. Even so, after each session of perception, the weariness on her pale face deepened. The energy beam is still being emitted, but the rhythm seems to be slightly disrupted. After another brief perception session, Su Chanchian closed her eyes, her voice so soft it was almost drowned out by the wind.</p>
<p>The acceleration of that ancient fluctuation has indeed been slowed down very subtly like a heavy flywheel about to spin being gently tapped. Although it&#x27;s still spinning, it&#x27;s not as smooth anymore. Caesar seems a bit impatient. I sense some unusual fluctuations in the metallic energy reactions in several places. Impatientness is a good thing, Sher House said after returning from checking the antifreeze measures in the lower cabins.</p>
<p>It means our presence is indeed bothering him. The more anxious he is, the more likely he is to make a mistake. Lynamo nodded and asked, &quot;What about those deep sea creatures that were attracted there? How are they doing?&quot; Suchan frowned even more deeply. They&#x27;re still gathering, and I feel their state is changing. At first, it was passive attraction, like sleepwalking.</p>
<p>But now, creatures that get close to the energy beam seem to go through a very brief, painful struggle phase before being absorbed. Although it disappears quickly, the sudden sharp dissipation of life energy is very clear. She couldn&#x27;t help but shiver, unsure whether it was from the cold or something else. Sacrifice. Lynamo repeated the word Caesar had used in a low voice, his eyes icy.</p>
<p>To use life energy to heat or activate an ancient being. This method had already exceeded the scope of ordinary ambition, exuding a nauseating and sinister aura. as Dragon Soul replied. He looked at the team member in charge of communications. The team member shook his head.</p>
<p>The wind, snow, and energy interference are too strong, and the bassband communication is intermittent. The last complete message we received was 4 hours ago. Captain Xiao confirmed that their fast reaction fleet had established a forward position about 60 nautical miles to our southwest. But due to the obstruction of floating ice and the bad sea conditions, large-scale advancement is difficult. They&#x27;re trying to send small high-speed ships and reconnaissance units to approach us, which is expected to take some time.</p>
<p>A distant source of water cannot quench an immediate thirst. Lynn and Mo knew that at least for the crucial period ahead, they would largely have to rely on themselves. How about Leeway? Any new discoveries at the Rune Tower? The communications team member nodded. Engineer Lee just sent a very brief encrypted message saying that the tower&#x27;s deep scanning array has captured the interior of that ancient fluctuation which appears to contain multiple resonant cavity structures with energy circulating and reinforcing within them. He believes that if the stability of one or more of these resonant cavities could be disrupted or even destroyed, it could cause much greater obstacles to the entire activation process than is now.</p>
<p>However, he also emphasized that this is only a speculation based on the energy model without an actual structural diagram. The specific location and shape of the resonant cavities cannot be determined. Lynn Emmo noted down this keyword. It might be the key to their next move. Boss sure how walked to the nautical chart pointing to their current location and the estimated core area.</p>
<p>At our current speed and direction, we should be able to reach the edge of Caesar s fleet s circular formation in about 3 to 4 hours. At that point, it probably one TB as simple as just these two little toys monitoring us. His main warships and those large equipment one T let us get close to it. I know that Lin Mos gaze moved across the nautical chart, so we can&#x27;t TB stupid and just crash into it. We&#x27;re a flying fish and wavebreaker now.</p>
<p>As per your orders, they maneuvered on both sides of the perimeter, maintaining a distance that was neither too close nor too far. The two submersibles were mainly focused on us and their response to their harassment was not very proactive. Sherhow replied, &quot;Let them continue to patrol the perimeter, maintaining their presence.&quot; But Dante, let them easily enter the firing range of the enemy s circular formation. We need them as eyes and potential surprise weapons. Lynn Mo pondered.</p>
<p>As for the MOU on, we need to change our approach. Caesar s circular formation is to protect and maintain energy output to the seabed. So the defense inside the formation, especially the area directly below where the energy beam is focused, may actually be weakened to avoid affecting operations or rather his attention will be more focused on external threats. Sure, how&#x27;s eyes lit up. You want to come from underwater? It asked just one direction, Linmo said, not giving a definitive answer.</p>
<p>But the prerequisite is that we must first break through to a sufficiently close distance and find an opportunity. The underwater equipment and jammers of the special operations reserve team are prepared for this possibility. But now he glanced at the two stubborn shadows outside the window. We need to get rid of or lure away these two tagalongs at least to create a brief window of opportunity. How to draw them away? A direct attack won&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>It might play right into Caesar&#x27;s hands and trigger a full-scale conflict. Showing weakness and retreating, that&#x27;s even less likely. Suchanian suddenly spoke softly. They seem to be waiting for some command or perhaps waiting for some opportunity. I can sense that their energy response is very stable, almost blending into the chaotic background of the sea area with only slight fluctuations when they occasionally adjust their position.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t seem to have any intention to attack autonomously, waiting for the right moment. Linmo pondered the phrase, his gaze fixed on the snow-covered northeast. That was the source of the energy fluctuations and the core of Caesar&#x27;s operation. Could it be that Caesar&#x27;s entire plan, including the peripheral interception and surveillance, was proceeding according to a precise timetable? Was he waiting for a specific energy peak or a certain phase of a cold wave? Just then, the ship shuddered violently, more violently than any of the previous impacts. At the same time, a teeth grinding, creaking sound came from the wood, twisting and squeezing.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve hit a large ice flow on the starboard side. There&#x27;s a leak report. came the anxious shout from the lower deck over the radio. Damage control team, proceed immediately. Assess the damage.</p>
<p>Sherhow responded immediately. Lynn Emmo strode to the right observation window. There a jagged grayish white iceberg roughly the size of a small house was slowly separating from the starboard stern of the MOU on where the ship&#x27;s hull had rubbed against the iceberg with chips and ice fragments were mixed together. Although the ship had been reinforced, the impact was clearly severe. Misfortune never comes singly.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the impact, a submersible that had been steadily monitoring the flank suddenly flashed its dark red light a few times and then without warning began to turn, not toward the but accelerating toward the snowstorm on the other side and quickly disappeared from sight. Is there only one left? Everyone on the bridge was taken back. Was it because the Mo Yuan had been suddenly damaged, reducing their assessment of the threat, or had something more serious happen over there? Suchian forced herself to focus and turned her senses back to the direction where the submersible had disappeared. After a moment, a look of confusion appeared on her face. A very small but sharp hole suddenly appeared in the energy background over there, as if something had briefly absorbed the surrounding free energy.</p>
<p>It was very abrupt and didn&#x27;t seem like a natural phenomenon. The other submersible went in that direction. A hollow space attracting a submersible. Lin Mo&#x27;s mind raced. Had Dragon Souls reconnaissance units successfully infiltrated? Or beneath this icy sea besides Caesar&#x27;s target was something else that had also been alerted.</p>
<p>Whatever it may be, this sudden turn of events seems to have torn a tiny crack in the tight surveillance network between them and Caesar. The opportunity has arrived. A cold glint flashed in Linmo&#x27;s eyes. Sure. How? Order the Emo Yuan to maneuver behind the largest iceberg to the left front, using the terrain to temporarily obscure the remaining submersible view.</p>
<p>Flying fish and wave breaker conduct probing reconnaissance towards that cavity, but don&#x27;t go too deep. Focus on confirming the situation. What about the extent of the damage? Sure, how asked. As long as it doesn&#x27;t sink, keep going, Lyno said decisively. Tell the damage control team that I&#x27;m giving them half an hour to bring the leak under control.</p>
<p>We need speed now and we also need a bit of luck. The MO you on dragging its damaged starboard side struggled but determinately adjusted its course through the wind, snow, and floating ice heading toward the shadow of the iceberg that resembled a silent behemoth in the distance. The remaining submersible seemed to hesitate for a moment, its dark red light flickering erratically. Ultimately, it did not immediately follow, but remained in place, as if observing or waiting for new instructions. A crevice had appeared, though small, a keen enough hunter would spot a glimmer of light within.</p>
<p>Every step from here on would be more dangerous and more crucial. Chapter 65, Whispers of the Cold Abyss. The Mo Yuon, dragging its damaged starboard side, glided slowly into the leeward side of the massive iceberg like a wounded whale. Instantly, the raging blizzard and surging waves from the northeast were mostly blocked by the huge ice, and the pressure on the ship was suddenly relieved, leaving only the muffled howling of the wind from the other side of the iceberg like the breathing of a giant beast. A temporary respit.</p>
<p>Inside the bridge, everyone remained on edge. Sherhow had personally let a team down to assess the damage. His brief instructions and reports constantly coming through the walkie-talkie. Three ribs are cracked and there&#x27;s a hole in the outer hole. Sea water is seeping in at a moderate rate.</p>
<p>The leak sealing team is using quick setting gel and pressure fill planks. The backup pumps have been started and should be able to control the situation within half an hour. Lynn and Mo stood in front of the relatively calm port observation window. His gaze fixed on the faint dark red glow of the only remaining submersible visible on the other side of the iceberg. It remained stationary about 400 meters away on the sea surface, neither approaching nor leaving like a leopard patiently waiting for its prey to reappear.</p>
<p>It is still waiting, Su Chanchian said softly. She was wrapped in a blanket, her face still pale, but her eyes had regained a little clarity. The void has disappeared. The other submersible didn&#x27;t te return. I can t sense what happened over there at all.</p>
<p>It asks like I&#x27;m being shielded by something. D shielding. Then mo pondered. Was it dragon souls jamming equipment? Or was there truly something beneath that icy sea that could silently swallow even Caesar&#x27;s submersible? Any news about flying fish and breaking waves? He asked the communications team member. Just received a brief light signal from flying fish.</p>
<p>Arrived in the general area of the hollow. No obvious anomalies found, but seawater temperature and energy readings are extremely unstable. Advised not to venture further. They are conducting a perimeter reconnaissance. It wasn&#x27;t surprising that Lynn Mo wasn&#x27;t found.</p>
<p>It would have been strange if he had been found so easily. What concerned him more was the instability of the seawater temperature and energy. This sea area was like a pressure cooker about to boil over. Its surface appeared covered in ice and snow, but its interior was filled with violent and chaotic power. Order them to maintain their distance and continue monitoring that area, focusing on whether any new voids appear or anything else that doesn&#x27;t belong to Caesar&#x27;s fleet is active, Lin Mo instructed.</p>
<p>Then he turned to Sue Chanchan. Chansen, while things are relatively calm now, carefully sense the core area and that ancient fluctuation again and see if there are any new changes after we broke through the surveillance and approached. Note that if you feel any discomfort, stop immediately. Such Chan nodded, took a few deep breaths of the cold air, and closed her eyes again. This time, she deliberately slowed down, letting her senses flow like a gentle stream rather than the raging waves before, carefully bypassing the chaotic surface energy of the sea area, and probing towards the heavy and magnificent pulse in the depths.</p>
<p>Time ticked by. Only the faint hum of the ventilation ducts and the distant, indistinct sounds of leak ceiling operations remained on the bridge. Lyn Mo waited quietly, his gaze occasionally sweeping across the silent iceberg outside the observation window and the snow-covered sea further away. The iceberg&#x27;s surface was not smooth, but covered with grooves and holes carved by millions of years of wind and frost, resembling a gigantic, indifferent face in the dim light. About 10 minutes later, Su Chian&#x27;s eyelashes fluttered a few times, and she slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Her expression was somewhat strange, a mixture of confusion, a hint of fear, and some indescribable understanding. &quot;That ancient fluctuation,&quot; she said softly, as if afraid of disturbing something. Its acceleration has indeed been slowed down, but it seems to be differentiating inside. The differentiation then monts like a chaotic hole that s starting to produce different sounds. Sue Chian struggled to find the right words.</p>
<p>Before it felt like a heavy single pulse dot, but now I can vaguely discern at least two or three different rhythms or intentions intertwined within it. One is still heavy and slow, carrying endless weariness, as if it wants to continue sleeping. Another has become somewhat eager, even greedy, actively absorbing and responding to what the Caesar energy beam is transmitting. And there is a a third one that s very faint almost imperceptible but it feels very cold and very alienating to me like an observer or like it s calculating something dot three different intentions. Lynn Mohart trembled violently.</p>
<p>Could it be that the ancient being beneath the sea was not a unified consciousness or device but some kind of composite entity? Or did Caesar&#x27;s activation process inadvertently trigger some previously dormant different parts within it? Does Caesar know about this? Sure, how having finished treating the damage, returned to the bridge covered in cold air and water stains just in time to hear Su Chanchians words. It&#x27;s hard to say, Lynn Mo shook his head. If he knows, it might be exactly what he wants to awaken the greedy part within him and use it for his own purposes. If he doesn&#x27;t know, then he might be opening a Pandora&#x27;s box that even he can&#x27;t control. In either case, it means the situation is sliding into an even more unpredictable abyss.</p>
<p>What can we do? Su Chian looked at Linmo, her eyes filled with worry. That greedy part seems to be absorbing life energy even faster. Those deep sea creatures that have been attracted there. The resonant cavity that Lee Wayne mentioned, Lynmo&#x27;s thoughts became clearer. If the ancient wave really begins to differentiate and different rhythms appear, then the corresponding resonant cavity structures may also be different and they may even interfere with or compete with each other.</p>
<p>If we can find and interfere with a resonant cavity that represents the intention of greed, we may be able to exacerbate its internal instability or even trigger internal strife, disrupting Caesar&#x27;s plans. The principle is simple, but putting it into practice is incredibly difficult. They don&#x27;t even know the specific shape and location of the resonant cavity, let alone distinguish which corresponds to which intention. We need to get closer. We need a clearer perception.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo and Mo looked at Sue Chanchian, then at the iceberg outside the window. We need to continue getting closer to the core and we need to find a relatively safe location where we can listen clearly. This iceberg is only a temporary refuge, not a long-term solution. Shirhow walked to the nautical chart and pointed to the area between the icebergs and the core region. This area has dense floating ice and scattered icebergs, resulting in extremely poor visibility, but it also facilitates concealment and maneuverability.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s main circular formation should be about 10 to 15 nautical miles ahead. If we can use the cover provided by these iceberg formations to get closer and then what? rely on this behemoth, the Mo Yuan, to navigate through the ice flows? A first mate asked skeptically. That collision just now was bad enough. No, the Mo Yuan will remain here as a diversionary force and a last stitch backup. That Linmo made the decision.</p>
<p>Sure, how you select the most elite special forces members carrying underwater equipment, jammers, and other necessary tools. They will travel in the flying fish and wave breaker using the agility of small boats to infiltrate through the iceberg crevices and get as close to the core area as possible. Your mission is not a frontal attack but reconnaissance and location. If possible, find the energy characteristics of the resonant cavity that Leeway mentioned and attempt to use the jammers for probing sabotage. He paused, then looked at Sue Chian.</p>
<p>Chansen, you need to go with them. Only your senses can distinguish those different intentions and their possible corresponding energy nodes. I know it&#x27;s dangerous, but I go do Sue. Changian nodded without hesitation, her eyes firm. Remote sensing from here is still a barrier.</p>
<p>Only by getting closer can we see more clearly and hear more accurately. Dot. I will protect Miss Sue. Sure house said solemnly. The operation must be swift and covert.</p>
<p>If discovered or if Caesar&#x27;s operation encounters a major setback, retreat immediately without hesitation. Lynn Mo instructed the MOU on will create some disturbance here to attract the attention of the remaining submersible and any other possible surveillance forces. We will maintain communication silence and only receive your emergency signals. The plan was quickly finalized. Sherhow immediately went to select team members and prepare equipment.</p>
<p>Such Chian also took the time to rest, preparing for the upcoming high-intensity sensory training. Lynn Emmo walked alone to the edge of the bridge, gazing out the window at the seemingly ancient iceberg. Beneath the icy abyss, whispers began to rise and divisions began to emerge. A storm stirred up by ambitious individuals was drawing everyone into its grip. The small team he dispatched would be like a slender yet sharp probe, piercing the vortex at the heart of the storm, listening to the dangerous whispers from the deep sea and trying to find a glimmer of hope before destruction strikes.</p>
<p>A glimmer of light will ignite between the ice crevices. Chapter 66. Glimmer of light in the ice crevice. Like two thin black blades, the flying fish and breaking waves silently slid out of the huge shadow cast by the Mo Yuon and disappeared into the even deeper darkness and snowstorm behind the iceberg. Sherhow personally commanded from the flying fish, which also carried Su Chanchian and four of the most elite special forces members.</p>
<p>The other five members, led by Vice Captain Lou Fong, were aboard the Wave Breaker, responsible for flank cover and rear guard action. Both ships underwent additional camouflage. The dark sails were furled, replaced with lower auxiliary sails and longer orars, and key parts of holes were bound with gray white burlap and broken ice, blending them as seamlessly as possible into their surroundings. The moment we left the leeward side of the iceberg, a raging blizzard and biting cold enveloped us once more. The temperature was even lower than before.</p>
<p>The snowflakes were no longer soft down, but fine, hard- eyes crystals that stung our faces. The seawater had become unusually viscous, taking on an opaque, dark gray hue with a thin, semi-olid, oily substance floating on its surface, creating significant resistance as the oars paddled through it. Su Xian was wrapped in her thickest fur clothing with a waterproof rubber cloak over it, but the chill still seeped in everywhere. She forced herself to ignore the discomfort in her body and focused all her attention on her senses. This time she no longer pursued range or intensity, but instead condensed her senses into an extremely thin line like a deep sea fishing probe, carefully avoiding the chaotic energy turbulence on the surface, extending towards the heavy and complex pulse source in the northeast direction.</p>
<p>Straight ahead at 1:00, about 2 nautical miles away, there are large amount of metal fragments and biological remains deposited underwater. The energy residue is very chaotic. It may be the sight of a previous battle or accident. We suggest you detour.&quot; Her voice was transmitted to Shhau&#x27;s ears through a speciallymade resonant bone piece close to the corner of his mouth. The volume was just loud enough to be heard, but wouldn&#x27;t carry too far.</p>
<p>Sherhow nodded and gestured to the helmsmen and the breaking waves. The two small boats, like ghosts, skillfully navigated through the increasingly dense ice flows, avoiding the danger zones indicated by Su Chanchian. Navigation became exceptionally difficult. Visibility was almost zero, relying entirely on Su Chanchian senses and the helmsman season experience. The ice flows were of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Some had sharp knifelike edges while others were hidden underwater only revealing inconspicuous corners. The hull occasionally scraped against the ice flows producing a teeth grinding creek. Everyone held their breath even deliberately softening their rowing movements. The sound of the oars cutting into the water completely masked by the howling wind and snow. On the left at the 9:00 position about 800 meters away, there are signs of life sea creatures quite numerous gathered under a large ice flow.</p>
<p>Their energy state is very volatile, but they show no signs of moving as if they are waiting for something. Suchan warned again. Shirhow immediately signaled the ship to veer to the right and create some distance. Through the swirling ice crystals, one could vaguely see the bottom of the small mountain-like ice flow to the left, where countless dark shadows were writhing, and occasionally a pale bony spike or scale would flash by. Those were predators attracted or driven there temporarily lying dormant for some reason.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep moving forward. Keep your distance,&quot; Shha whispered. Their target wasn&#x27;t these sea monsters. After sailing for another half hour, Su Chian&#x27;s breathing suddenly became more rapid. We&#x27;ve entered an energy depression.</p>
<p>The concentration of free energy around us is very low, as if it has been drained by something. It&#x27;s very quiet here. Even the sound of wind and snow seems quieter. Sure, how cautiously looked around. Indeed, there seemed to be fewer ice flows here.</p>
<p>The sea was relatively calm, and the wind and snow were no longer so fierce. But this unusual calm made him uneasy. &quot;Look underwater,&quot; a sharp-eyed special forces soldier, said in a low voice. Looking down, everyone saw faint, almost imperceptible dark green halos in the deep gray seawater, flickering slowly like breathing. &quot;These halos were not chaotic, but rather vaguely formed winding paths leading northeast.</p>
<p>Is it because the pheromone residue was solidified by the low temperature, so became visible?&quot; Such Chanchian said uncertainly. The energy characteristics are very similar to those used by Caesar before, but they are more old, as if they were left behind a long time ago. Had Caesar been here before, or did these traces belong to earlier explorers? Sure, how wondered, but the low-lying area beneath his feet seemed safe for the time being. He gestured for the ship to continue along a faintly glowing crevice, slowing it down to its lowest speed. Such Chians perception continued to extend forward.</p>
<p>As she drew closer, the different voices within that ancient fluctuation became increasingly clear. The one with a greedy and active intention to absorb was the most obvious, like a thirsty abyss, constantly devouring the nutrients supplied from above, Caesar&#x27;s energy beam, and around the attracted creatures. The heavy and weary voice, on the other hand, was like background noise. Although it still existed, it seemed to be suppressed by the former&#x27;s activity. What concerned her most was the third one, that faint, cold, and alienated sense of calculation.</p>
<p>It seemed to exist deeper within the entire fluctuation structure, not participating in absorption, but simply quietly observing and recording all the flow and changes of energy. Brother, sure how Sue Chian suddenly said softly, her voice trembling slightly. I think I can sense the approximate locations of those resonant cavities that not their specific shapes, but the nodes where energy converges and transforms. The node corresponding to the greedy intention is in the upper middle layer of the wave structure near the energy input where is the most active and also the most unstable. The node corresponding to the calculation intention is very deep where the energy flow is extremely complex and precise like a central hub dot.</p>
<p>Can you pinpoint the location? Even just the general direction. Sure, how asked immediately. Such an closed her eyes trying to match the vague sense of space with her current direction. Greed node is northeast of our current location about two to 300 meters below the sea surface. calculation node is in a similar direction but deeper possibly more than 500 m or even deeper and she paused there seems to be a very special energy barrier around that calculation node my senses have a hard time penetrating it feels very hard and very exclusive between 200 and 300 m and above 500 m sure how&#x27;s heart sank with their current rudimentary underwater equipment reaching such depths was virtually impossible leeways jammer was designed to operate at a depth of only about 100 m.</p>
<p>Is it possible to indirectly affect that greedy node by interfering with the energy input from the outside? Sherhow proposed another idea. It has possible. Suchan pondered. Caesar s energy beam was launched from a ship on the sea surface. If we can interfere with it before it reached the seabed or destroy the source of the beam.</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, the breaking wave ship, which have been silent all along, suddenly emitted a series of rapid light signals indicating that an anomaly has been detected. Sure, how Sue Chanchian immediately looked towards the left rear towards the breaking waves. In the swirling snow, the outline of the breaking waves seemed somewhat blurred and about a 100 meters to its side. A nearly perfect circular area about 20 m in diameter abruptly appeared on the sea surface. The water in that area was noticeably darker, almost inky black and completely still, creating an eerie contrast with the surrounding undulating sea.</p>
<p>Even more unsettling was that the water at the edge of the circular area was slowly but visibly denting towards the center as if an invisible funnel was sucking water in from below. It&#x27;s a void. It looks just like the one that lured the submersible away before. Sukianken exclamed, &quot;It&#x27;s moving, heading towards Caesar&#x27;s core formation.&quot; Almost as soon as she finished speaking, without warning, a thick, dark brown pillar, its surface covered with irregular nodules and deep grooves, slowly rose from the center of the inky black circular hole. The top of the pillar disappeared into the wind and snow, obscuring its entirety, but the part that was visible above the sea was nearly 10 m high and over 3 m in diameter.</p>
<p>It stood there silently, exuding an indescribable ancient aura mixed with decay and silence. It was not a submersible, not a ship, and not any known sea creature. What is that? Everyone on the two small boats felt their hair stand on end instantly, and even their breathing stopped. The moment Sue Chian&#x27;s senses touched that pillar, it was as if she had crashed into a cold, hard wall formed by endless years and death, and was violently bounced back. She groaned.</p>
<p>Her face turned ashen. Her body swayed and she almost fell over, but Shh next caught her. Chan. Shir House said urgently. No, it&#x27;s nothing.</p>
<p>Such Chian gritted her teeth and stood firm, but her eyes were filled with horror. That thing is alive, but it&#x27;s not a living being. Its energy is very similar to the deepest, most weary part of that ancient fluctuation. Is it a part separated from an ancient being on the seabed? Or is it a limb that was attracted up? As sure how gazed at the eerie silent pillar and then at the faint glow of the Caesar fleet in the distance amidst the wind and snow, a terrifying conjecture took shape in his mind. Could it be that what Caesar is trying to activate is not some underwater device at all, but some indescribable enormous being sleeping beneath the icy abyss? And are these suddenly appearing cavities and pillars the tentacles or symbols unconsciously emitted by this being during the forced awakening process? If that&#x27;s the case, they will no longer be facing Caesar&#x27;s fleet and technology, but some unimaginable, indescribable terror belonging to the ancient history of this world.</p>
<p>Retreat. Shhal made a decisive decision, signaling the breaking waves to retreat at full speed. retreat to the ink abyss immediately. Quickly, without hesitation, the two small boats turned around, their oars pounding wildly as they sped off in the direction they had come from. Behind them, the massive dark brown pillar still stood silently in the center of the shrinking cavity, like an indifferent ancient deity statue from the deep sea, quietly watching the escape of these tiny intruders.</p>
<p>Between the eyes creasses, what they glimpsed was not a glimmer of hope, but a desparing shadow cast by the abyss. Chapter 60. Seven. Returning shadow scheme. Like startled swordfish, the flying fish and wave breaker darted desperately through the gaps in the ice flows, leaving the wind, snow, and the sea with its eerie giant pillars far behind.</p>
<p>The rower&#x27;s arms swung mechanically, their lungs burning. But no one dared to slow down as if an unseen terror was chasing them. Only when the familiar mountainlike black silhouette of the Mo Yuon appeared ahead through the swirling snow did the tents nerves relax slightly. The two small boats almost crashed into the relatively calm waters on the leeward side of the iceberg, and the crew members hurriedly through the mooring lines to the hooks lowered by the yuon. Sure, how half carrying and half supporting the pale-faced and nearly exhausted Sue Chanchian climbed the rope ladder onto the deck of the Linmo, who was already waiting at the side, immediately stepped forward to help her into the bridge lounge, which had been prepared and was heated by a stove.</p>
<p>Luong also quickly boarded the ship with the crew of the breaking waves, each of them still showing signs of shock. What&#x27;s the situation? Lynn Mo handed a steaming cup of herbal tea with honey and ginger to Sue Chanchians cold hands, then looked at Sherhow and asked succinctly. Shirha took a few deep breaths of a warm air trying to steady his voice and quickly and clearly recounted the encounter with a void, the strange giant pillar rising and the terrifying connection that Sue Chanchian sensed. His description was objective, but when he mentioned the pillar and its connection to the ancient existence on the seabed, his voice inevitably became a little horse. The bridge was deafly silent, say for the occasional hissing sound from the heating pipes.</p>
<p>Even the bravest warrior felt a chill run down his spine upon hearing such a bizarre description that defied comprehension and seemed to touch the very depths of the world. Su Chian held the warm ceramic cup in both hands, absorbing its negligible warmth. After Shshirehau finished speaking, she added in a horse voice, &quot;The feeling the thing gave me was almost identical to the most weary and heavy part of that ancient wave at the bottom of the sea. It wasn&#x27;t the activated subject, but rather something like a metabolic byproduct or extended limb unconsciously emitted by the subject during its involuntary awakening process. Caesar&#x27;s forced feeding of that greedy part with energy beams and life energy may have caused instability in the entire existence, and these pillars are an outward manifestation of this instability.</p>
<p>She paused, a hint of lingering fear flashing in her eyes. Moreover, when my senses touched it, what I felt wasn&#x27;t malice or even consciousness, but a pure cold presence and the discomfort of being forcibly disturbed. It&#x27;s like being pricricked by a needle in deep sleep. Your body will instinctively twitch regardless of willpower. Lynn Mo listened in silence, his fingers unconsciously tapping the table covered with nautical charts.</p>
<p>The situation was worse and more complicated than he had anticipated. Caesar&#x27;s target was clearly not some ancient weapon or treasure, but a colossal, incomprehensible being slumbering beneath the abyss. His attempt to crudely feed and control a part of it might be triggering an unpredictable awakening reaction from the entire being. &quot;Those pillars were proof of that.&quot; &quot;What about that computation node? Any new discoveries?&quot; Lin Mo asked. Su Chanhan shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;The distance is too far. The interference is too strong.&quot; And after being hit by that pillar later, my perception was completely messed up. I can only confirm that it is still there and that barrier feels even more secure to me. It&#x27;s like when the main body is unstable inside. It strengthens the protection of certain key areas.</p>
<p>Protection. Lenmo caught the word. If that computing node was some kind of central hub or control core, then it&#x27;s self-p protection. Did it mean that this ancient entity was not a completely unconscious chaotic thing, but rather possessed some kind of inherent, possibly extremely primitive or peculiar order or logic? This could be either a danger or an opportunity. Any news from Leeway? Lenmo asked the communications team member.</p>
<p>Yes. Engineer Lee sent over the latest analysis and combined with the proximity sensing data we provided earlier. He revised the model. The team member quickly reported he believes that the structure of that ancient wave is closer to a multi-layered superimposed resonance system. The greedy node is located in the shallower active layer that frequently exchanges energy with the outside world.</p>
<p>The fatigue node constitutes the huge base or background layer while the computation node may be located in the deeper core control area. Caesar s energy beam is forcibly stimulating the active layer attempting to overload it and in turn influence or even control the core area but this crude method is very likely to trigger reactive disorder in the entire system and those pillars may be the external manifestation of disorder in the base layer dot leeway&#x27;s analysis and suian&#x27;s perceptions corroborated each other painting a relatively clear picture although the picture itself was chilling stressinduced disorder Lynn Mo repeated the term his eyes growing increasingly thoughtful. What if Caesar&#x27;s forceful stimulation caused disorder in the entire system rather than just activation? What if that computation node or rather the core control area had an instinct to reject or correct this disorder? Sure house seemed to understand boss. Do you mean we might not need to directly confront Caesar or that being itself? Instead, we can utilize the contradictions between them. It has just a possibility.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo said cautiously. We Danty know what the correction mechanism of that core control zone is, how strong it is, or whether it will cause a more terrible chain reaction. But compared to directly challenging an existence that we cannot understand at all, or directly attacking Caesar s main fleet that is on high alert, this may be a relatively low-risk entry point that could potentially achieve great results with minimal effort. He walked to the nautical chart, pointed to their current location, then traced the outline of Caesar&#x27;s fleet and deeper into its formation. We need to verify this hypothesis.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must prepare for the worst. If the disorder gets out of control, or if Caesar does manage to gain control of some of the forces, we must have contingency plans to stop or counter it. How exactly do we do it? Such an asked, her complexion improving and her eyes regaining focus. Three steps, Linmo said clearly. First, intelligence confirmation and battlefield disruption.</p>
<p>Sure, how you take flying fish and wavebreaker and set off again. This time, the objective is not to penetrate deeper, but to observe the patterns of the appearance and movement of those pillars on the periphery, as well as their interaction with the Caesar fleet and the energy fluctuations on the seabed. At the same time, when the opportunity arises, use leeways jammer to conduct small-cale probing harassment of the transmission path or peripheral equipment of the Caesar energy beam. It doesn&#x27;t t need to cause much damage, just create chaos, interfere with their operational precision, and observe the reaction changes of the various nodes of the ancient existence. Secondly, technical preparations and contingency planning.</p>
<p>I will contact Leewi immediately and have him prioritize the development of two things based on the new situation. One is an enhanced version of a jammer attempting to target the energy barrier characteristics of that computation node to see if we can find a way to resonate or penetrate even if it&#x27;s just a very weak influence. The other is an emergency escape and protection plan. If the situation completely spirals out of control, we need to be able to quickly evacuate this sea area in extreme environments and protect ourselves as much as possible from potential mental or energy shocks. He looked at Sue Chanchan Chanchen.</p>
<p>This requires you to provide leeway with more detailed perception data. Third, allied coordination and final contingency plans. We will encrypt and synchronize all the information we have found so far, including speculation about the ancient being and the possibility of reactive disorder and send it to Xiao Gi Gang of Dragon Soul. We will request them to exert greater pressure on the periphery to restrain Caesar&#x27;s defensive forces and discuss together how to jointly respond if the worst case scenario occurs such as the being fully awakening or Caesar gaining partial control and even whether it is necessary to implement some kind of ultimate destruction plan such as using the maximum explosive yield to completely collapse the entrance or key node of that underwater structure. Lynn Mo&#x27;s voice was calm, but its content sent a chill down everyone&#x27;s spine.</p>
<p>Ultimate destruction was the last resort, meaning abandoning the unknown knowledge and power it might contain, and also implying enormous, unpredictable ecological risks. But if it really came to that, it might be the only option to prevent an even greater catastrophe. I&#x27;ll go prepare immediately. Sure, how didn&#x27;t hesitate and turn to prepare the team and ships. I will record all the details I perceive, including the energy sensation of that pillar and pass them on way.</p>
<p>Suchan also forced herself to stand up. Lynn Emma nodded, his gaze once again turning to the snow-covered north outside the window. There, Caesar&#x27;s ambition and the ancient secrets of the deep sea were dangerously intertwined. And he he had to make the calmst and most decisive move on this frozen chessboard. The shadow of return brought a deeper fear, but also a glimmer of hope for breaking the deadlock.</p>
<p>The plan was made. The next step was action. Chapter 68. The icicles appear. Sure.</p>
<p>How leading the newly repaired flying fish and wave breaker once again glided out of the protection of the Mo Yuan like a ghost, disappearing into the chaotic snowstorm surrounding the iceberg. This time the team included two apprentices urgently dispatched by Lee Wayi carrying improved energy recorders and several prototype jammers equipped with simple delay triggering devices. The mission objectives were clear observation recording and limited harassment. With the experience from before and more precise route planning, the team&#x27;s journey went much more smoothly. Before setting off, Such Chian told Sher how in detail the approximate coordinates of the sea area where the pillar appeared and the characteristics of the residual energy and repeatedly instructed him to avoid that energy depression and its direction of extension.</p>
<p>The ship navigated through an increasingly treacherous labyrinth of floating ice. The wind and snow seemed endless, and visibility remained extremely poor, but Sherhow noticed that the temperature in the surrounding sea seemed to be rising very slowly. Although it was still bitterly cold, the semi-olid oily substance on the surface of the sea had thinned slightly. This was not a good sign. It might indicate that energy activity from the seabed was intensifying, affecting the local water temperature.</p>
<p>Following the coordinates provided by Su Chian, they carefully bypassed the central area where the pillar appeared, stopping about a nautical mile to the side behind a natural barrier formed by several medium-sized icebergs. They then lowered a speciallymade ice anchor to secure the vessel. This location was relatively concealed, yet they could observe the activity in the target sea area through gaps in the icebergs. Sherhow raised the moninocular telescope wrapped in animal hide, adjusted the focus, and peered through the wind, snow, and ice crevices. The sea appeared normal at the moment with only churning gray water and scattered ice flows.</p>
<p>But upon closer inspection, one could see that the water seemed darker than the surrounding area and the surface had an unnatural slightly inward swirling motion as if a slow whirlpool lay beneath. The energy reading is abnormal. The background free energy concentration is continuously increasing and the fluctuation frequency is accelerating. One of Lee Ways apprentices stared at the simple instrument in his hand, the pointer trembling rhythmically. It matches the characteristics of stress disorder described by sister Chanchandot.</p>
<p>Sure, how nodded, signaling his team to remain silent and observe. Time passed slowly, and apart from the sounds of wind, snow, and waves, the sea was deathly still. Just as Shirhow began to doubt his judgment. A sudden change occurred. First, a dense cluster of enormous bubbles rose without warning from the center of that dark water, bursting with dull thuds.</p>
<p>Then the sea surface began to noticeably sink, forming a slightly smaller, about 15 meter diameter inky black cavity than the one witnessed last time. Unlike before, this cavity was not stationary, but moved at a slow but steady pace towards the northeast, the core area of Caesar&#x27;s fleet circular formation. &quot;It&#x27;s moving. It&#x27;s heading towards Caesar,&quot; the lookout exclaimed at a low voice. Even more chilling is that as the cavity moves, the seawater at its edge seems to be pulled and lifted by an invisible force, gradually condensing and shaping into a dark brown pillar similar to the one seen last time, but slightly thinner and with more dense knots on its surface.</p>
<p>Like a strange giant tree growing from the deep sea, accompanied by tooth grinding, subtle sound like rocks rubbing together, it slowly rises from the center of the cavity. This time, due to the closer distance and better viewing angle, Sure. How could see it more clearly. The surface of the pillar wasn&#x27;t completely smooth. Within those deep grooves, a faint dark blue light flowed, like solidified blood vessels or remnants of some kind of energy circuit.</p>
<p>The pillar still exuded a sense of decay and silence, but it seemed to have gained an inexplicable directionality. It wasn&#x27;t standing randomly. Its slight tilt clearly pointed towards the direction of Caesar&#x27;s fleet. Record, all data, shape, speed of movement, energy changes. Sure, how ordered urgently, the two apprentices frantically but attentively operated the instrument.</p>
<p>Quickly sketching and recording on a speciallymade waterproof board with charcoal pencils. Team leader sure, look over there. There&#x27;s more than one. Luong relayed the signal from the breaking waves. Shirhow hurriedly adjusted the telescope&#x27;s direction.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction Lu Fong had indicated. Further away, about two or three nautical miles on the snow-covered sea, two similar, slightly smaller, inky black holes appeared. They were also moving slowly, their direction also pointing towards Caesar&#x27;s fleet. A short dark brown tip had already emerged from the center of one of the smaller holes. This is not an isolated case.</p>
<p>These strange pillars are appearing in multiple locations and seem to be drawn together by some unified force or attraction converging with a clear objective towards Caesar&#x27;s work area. Are they responding to Caesar&#x27;s energy beam or are they being attracted by the greedy nodes? Sure, how&#x27;s mind raced? Such Chian had said that the pillars were related to the fatigue base and the greedy nodes were being forcibly fed by Caesar. Could this stress induced disorder manifest as the base being attracted or stimulated by abnormal activity in the active layer, thus manifesting a portion of the entity and moving towards the stimulus source? If that&#x27;s the case, then Caesar isn&#x27;t controlling the situation. He&#x27;s playing with fire and getting burned. The greed he&#x27;s feeding may be attracting the unconscious attention or even backlash of the entire ancient being&#x27;s vast foundation.</p>
<p>Record the location and movement trajectory of all newly appearing voids. Estimate the time it will take for them to reach the outer perimeter of Caesar s formation. Sure how forced himself to calm down. This was invaluable intelligence. At the same time, he didn&#x27;t forget the limited harassment mission Lin Mo had assigned him.</p>
<p>He signaled to a special forces member on the flying fish to adjust the angle of a light crossbow and load it with a bolt specially made by Leewi with the arrow head replaced by small jammer. A short slow burning time delay fuse was also attached to the tail of the bolt to ensure that the jammer would be triggered near the predetermined depth. The target was not the pillar or the void, but rather a small area of sea about 100 m away to the side of the movement path of the two voids. It was close to the area where the Caesar energy beam might pass through based on Sue Chian&#x27;s previous perception of energy flow trends. put.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. Two crossbow bolts leaving barely perceptible trails disappeared into the wind, snow, and waves. Whether they would hit their intended range, whether they would trigger at the correct depth, and what the disruptive effect would be remained unknown. This was more like a trial balloon, a test of the stability of Caesar&#x27;s operating environment.</p>
<p>After firing the crossbow bolt, Sherhow didn&#x27;t hesitate. Retreat. Return to the Mouon via the second route. Their reconnaissance mission has been exceeded confirming the multiple locations and directional movement of the pillar. Harassment operations have also been carried out.</p>
<p>Staying any longer is too risky. Intelligence must be sent back immediately. The two small boats start again, speeding towards the Moan along a planned, more ciruitous and concealed route. Behind them, in the wind and snow, several silent giant pillars were slowly moving like indifferent judges from the deep sea, casting ever approaching enormous shadows upon the torch, ignited by human ambition and ignorance. Inside the bridge of the Mo Yuan Linmo had just received the emergency simulation results from Leeway relayed through the rune tower based on Suchians new data.</p>
<p>The simulation showed that if the stress manifestation of the baseline continued to intensify and interacted deeply with Caesar&#x27;s active layer stimulation, there was a 47% probability that it would trigger a deeper chain reaction imbalance in the entire ancient existence system, potentially leading to unpredictable consequences, including but not limited to larger scale physical structure manifestation, energy rampage, or even triggering some kind of cleanup protocol of that computation. note. Lynn Mo frowned as he looked at the term cleanup protocol. He hoped it was just a term from Leeway&#x27;s worst case scenario model. He looked out the window, waiting for Sherhow&#x27;s return and also for the next move in this perilous situation at the ICC.</p>
<p>Chapter 69 news from the ice abyss. When Sherhow returned to the Moon with flying fish and wave breaker, Linmo was already waiting in a small cabin in the inner fortress which served as a temporary combat analysis room. The charcoal stove was burning brightly, dispelling most of the chill that had crept in through the cracks in the door, but the air was still filled with the mixed smell of frozen oil, damp wood, and tense sweat. The situation is worse than expected, but also clearer to Sherhow took off his heavy coat, which was covered in ice crystals, took a large gulp of the hot soup Lynn Emo handed him, and began his report. His breath steaming in the air, he spoke quickly but clearly, explaining in detail the observations of multiple holes and pillars, their directional movement towards Caesar s fleet, and the attempted firing of jamming crossbow bolts.</p>
<p>The two accompanying apprentices immediately presented him with a waterproof board for recording data and leeways instruments. As Lynn Mo listened, he quickly skimmed through the hastily written but crucial notes. When he heard that the pillar had a dark blue glow on its surface and that its movement was directional, his brows furrowed deeply. This closely matched Sue Chian speculation about stress induced disorder and the attraction to the basal region. The location where you launched the jamming arrows is estimated to be on the flank of Caesar&#x27;s energy beam transmission path.</p>
<p>Linmo put down the recording tablet and looked at Sure. How have you observed any abnormal reactions? for example, energy beam fluctuations, changes in the pillar&#x27;s movement path, or any movements from Caesar&#x27;s fleet. Sha&quot; shook his head. &quot;The distance is too far, and the wind and snow are too strong, so we can&#x27;t see clearly.&quot; But before we withdrew, we could vaguely see the outer perimeter of Caesar&#x27;s fleet circular formation with our binoculars. There seemed to be signs of ship movement and the light signals were quite frequent, but we can&#x27;t be sure if it was related to our harassment.</p>
<p>At this moment, Su Chian, supported by Leewi, also entered the cabin. Her complexion was better than before, but the fatigue from over sensory perception still lingered in her eyes. The data brother how brought back matches my previous feelings. Her voice was somewhat weak, but she was very certain. Those pillars were indeed attracted by the abnormal activity of the greed node.</p>
<p>I can feel that in that ancient fluctuation on the seabed, the dissatisfaction or disturbance of the weariness base is intensifying. It&#x27;s like a sleeping person whose body is repeatedly pricricked by needles. Although they haven&#x27;t woken up yet, their entire body has begun to unconsciously tense up and resist. Leeway, what new progress has your model simulation made? Linmo turned to the technical director whose hair was disheveled and whose eyes were sunken. Leeway immediately perked up.</p>
<p>He walked to a small blackboard made of charred wood temporarily erected in the center of the cabin covered with complex symbols, formulas, and structural sketches. Combining the latest sensory data from Chian and the observations brought back by the stone team, the model has been corrected. He picked up a small piece of charcoal. We are now 80% certain that the ancient being is a highly complex layered energy matter composite system. The greedy node is located in the shallow active zone.</p>
<p>Highly interactive with the outside world and highly malleable but also the most unstable. The fatigue base constitutes over 90% of the systems mass and basic energy reserves. It is highly inert and slow to respond. But once triggered by a sufficiently strong anomalous stimulus, its mass will produce an overwhelming reaction. In the computation node, he paused, then emphasized the central circle of the sketch with his charcoal pencil.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s likely not a traditional control center, but more like a balancer or stabilization protocol execution unit. Its function is to monitor the state of the entire system. And when a serious imbalance occurs internally that could lead to system collapse, activate a preset correction or reset procedure. Clearance protocol. Linmo recalled the term from Leeway&#x27;s previous deduction report.</p>
<p>Yes, it has something like that. Leeway said excitedly. Of course, this is just an analogy. We Dantine know the specific form of the protocol of this ancient system. It could be a force suppression at the energy level, a reorganization of the material structure, or even the release of some kind of pheromone or field that we cannot understand to eliminate abnormal stimuli.</p>
<p>Linmo sure how and Sue Chanchian exchange a glance, all seeing the chill in each other&#x27;s eyes. If this purge protocol were triggered, and the biggest abnormal stimulus at present was Caesar&#x27;s fleet and energy beams, then Caesar would likely be the first to be affected. Is it possible? Shouse said in a deep voice that Caesar also knew about this risk if he dared to play with fire like this. Was he confident that he could control the greedy node before the protocol was triggered thereby influencing or even overriding the balancer? Possibly D. Leeway pushed up his glasses which had slipped down to the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>If he obtains sufficiently in-depth operational instructions or backdoor access to this system from his mentor or some other channel, theoretically he could indeed attempt to seize control. Dot. But this is extremely dangerous like welding next to a powder keg about to explode. The success rate is extremely low. And if he fails, that would detonate the powder keg prematurely.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo continued, his tone icy. And we are right next to that keg now. A brief silence fell over the cabin, broken only by the occasional crackling of the charcoal fire. Won&#x27;t the jamming arrows we launched? Such Chanchian asked with some concern. Probably not.</p>
<p>Leeway shook his head. Our interference is very weak and the target is directly impacting the system nodes. It is just disrupting the energy transmission environment. Compared to Caesar s energy beam, this interference is like throwing a pebble into a river. It might cause a few ripples, but it has far from enough to trigger the balancer&#x27;s judgment.</p>
<p>However, if Caesar s operation makes even the slightest mistake, causing the stimulation of the greedy nodes to get out of control. He didn&#x27;t finish his sentence, but his meaning was clear. The limited harassment by the Mo Yuan Pavilion might indirectly increase the risks of Caesar&#x27;s operations, thus accelerating the arrival of unpredictable consequences. Just then, the communications team member rushed in, knocking on the door and holding a new coded message. Boss, urgent message from Captain Xiao of Dragon Soul.</p>
<p>It came through the backup shortwave channel. The signal is weak, but the content has been deciphered. Lin Mo took the thin piece of animal skin paper soaked in a special solution. It bore Xiao Gi Gangs familiar handwriting, but the writing was more hasty and hurried than before. Lord Lyno, our high alitude reconnaissance balloons, luckily not frozen, have transmitted blurry images.</p>
<p>A large-scale whirlpool and unidentified luminous phenomena have appeared on the sea surface at the center of the Caesar ring formation with energy readings rising sharply. Their fleet has begun to retreat towards the outer perimeter of the formation, seemingly entering the final stage or encountering an accident. Our three rapid response fleets have broken through the outer ice barrier and are approaching your position at full speed. Expected to rendevu with your forces in 6 to 8 hours. In addition, our underwater listening array has detected a continuously increasing abnormal low-frequency soundwave originating from an unimaginable depth with characteristics inconsistent with any known sea creatures or custal activity.</p>
<p>Please be extremely vigilant. The situation may change. Please make a decision as soon as possible. Xiao Gang. Final stage.</p>
<p>An accident. Unidentified low-frequency soundwaves. Lynn Mo briefly explained the contents of the secret letter to everyone. Everyone&#x27;s hearts sank. Caesar&#x27;s actions were faster than expected or the situation was spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>And could the extremely deep-seated, abnormal, low-frequency sound waves detected by the dragon soul be the sign that the balancer Leewi had speculated was beginning to activate or respond? &quot;We don&#x27;t have much time left.&quot; Lyn Mo&#x27;s voice was exceptionally clear in the quiet cabin. &quot;Sure, how? Order the MOU on to prepare for departure, but keep it stationary and concealed for now. Flying fish and wave breaker will take turns resting and stand by at any time.&quot; Leeway, immediately maintain top priority contact with the rune tower. I need you to utilize all computing power and combining all available data. Deduce as much as possible.</p>
<p>First, if the balancer activates the cleanup protocol, what is the most likely manifestation, scope, and approximate effective time? Second, do we have any methods to subtly influence the balancer&#x27;s judgment, such as making it prioritize, locking on a Caesar, the biggest anomaly source? Lewi took a deep breath and nodded emphatically. I&#x27;ll do my best, Chian. Lynamo said, looking at Sue Chian one last time, his tone slow but firm. You need to rest, but you also need to be prepared. From now on, your senses may be the only basis for us to determine whether and when the balancer is activated.</p>
<p>Once you sense a qualitative change in the energy pattern of that computing node on the seabed or that low-frequency sound wave reaches a certain critical point, notify me immediately. Dotto lenmo walked to the port hole of the small cabin and looked out at the endless wind and snow. The huge shadow of the iceberg was cast on the moan like the haze of fate. Caesar is accelerating his madness. The ancient beings of the deep sea are brewing an unknown counterattack.</p>
<p>The dragon souls reinforcements are on their way and they stand on the edge of the eye of the storm, trying to grasp at that sliver of life that may not even exist in the vortex of destruction. The message travels through the icy abyss. The impending change is imminent. Every step from here on will be a gamble of life and death. Chapter 70.</p>
<p>Abyss resonance.  yuan. Like a colossal beast lurking in the shadow of an iceberg, waited silently. Time on the bridge seemed frozen in the extreme cold. Each second stretched long and viscous.</p>
<p>The charcoal stove struggled to radiate heat, but could not dispel the heavy pressure permeating the air. Suian, wrapped in a thick blanket, curled up in a chair near the radiator. She wasn&#x27;t asleep, nor could she truly rest. Her eyes were closed, but all her attention was focused on her ears, not with her ears, but with her innate, keen perception of the ocean&#x27;s pulse. Leewayi&#x27;s improved portable resonator rested on her lap, emitting a very faint, rhythmic hum to help her stabilize and focus that mysterious sensation.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo stood before the observation window, his gaze piercing through the frost that constantly condensed and was wiped away from the glass. Looking northeast, there lay the eye of the storm, the altar of Caesar&#x27;s ambition and the source of the ancient restless will of the deep sea. The wind and snow continued to rage, but whether it was his imagination or not, the howling wind seemed to carry a new, extremely low, almost indistinct yet unsettling hum. Shhow inspected the lower deck, ensuring that every damaged area was properly reinforced. Every weapon was ready to fire and every team member was bundled up in warm clothing, remaining vigilant at their posts.</p>
<p>The brief rest could not eliminate the fatigue from the continuous tension, but discipline and determination sustained them. About 2 hours have passed. Suddenly, the resonator on Sue Chanchians lap emitted a short, high-pitched shriek, followed by the pointer swinging wildly from side to side. She abruptly opened her eyes, her face instantly turning as white as paper, her fingers gripping the armrests of a chair tightly, her knuckles turning blue. It as here, her voice trembled uncontrollably, not from fear, but from a sense of insignificance and awe in the face of overwhelming power.</p>
<p>That computing node, the balancer, its energy mode has changed. It has moved from monitoring to preparing for activation. Lynamo was suddenly turned around and stroed up to her. What exactly does it feel like? Can you determine what&#x27;s being activated? Such Chian breathed rapidly, struggling to organize her thoughts. It&#x27;s like an enormous, incredibly precise instrument where all the gears and levers inside are silently aligning and meshing, preparing for final operation.</p>
<p>The energy is no longer just flowing calmly, but is beginning to converge and compress towards a certain focus. That feeling of coldness, alienation, and calculation hasn&#x27;t changed, but it&#x27;s become sharper and more purposeful. And that low frequency soundwave, which the dragon soul reported before, I can now vaguely hear too, not a sound, but a pressure pulse that directly affects my senses. Almost as soon as she finished speaking, several crystal chandeliers fixed to the cabin walls suddenly went out for a moment without warning, flickering violently a few times before returning to normal. At the same time, everyone felt an extremely slight but real tremor beneath their feet.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t the ship hitting an ice flow, but rather a dull, deep tremor emanating from the entire seabed, or rather the entire sea area itself. Everyone on board, stay calm. Check all systems. Shh&#x27;s voice came through the walkie-talkie, steady and powerful. Lynmo pressed down on Su Chanchian shoulders, feeling her slender body trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Can you determine its prepared target? Is it Caesar or all anomalous energy sources? Suian closed her eyes, cold sweat beating on her forehead, straining to decipher the inhuman logic flowing within that vast consciousness. The target is a group of abnormal stimulus sources prioritized based on the intensity of energy interference and the degree of disruption to system stability. She said haltingly. Caesar&#x27;s energy beam is the strongest and most persistent directly connected to the greed node and has the greatest destructive power and highest priority. But our interference arrows and other scattered energy disturbances in this E area have also been marked only with much lower priority, like incidental items on a cleanup list.</p>
<p>Just then, Leeway burst through the hatch, his hair standing on end, clutching a roll of thermal blueprints just transmitted from the rune tower. The blueprints displayed wildly fluctuating curves. Boss, the tower&#x27;s deep scanning array has captured crucial evidence. Look at this waveform. He spread the blueprints on the table.</p>
<p>This is the real-time curve of the computation nodes energy convergence. This is the intensity feedback of the Caesar energy beam. And this is the comprehensive index of environmental anomalies. These three curves showed a strong correlation 10 minutes ago. The slope of the computation nodes convergence curve has increased sharply almost synchronously with the intensity curve of the Caesar energy beam and the slight fluctuations in the environmental disturbance index which likely include our interference have been incorporated into the computation nodes algorithm with an extremely low waiting coefficient.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s building a target model. The cleansing protocol initiation process has begun. His voice was from excitement and lack of sleep, but every word struck everyone&#x27;s hearts like an icicle. How long will the process take to start? What might be the cleaning method? Lyn Mo forced himself to remain absolutely calm. It as impossible to make a precise judgment.</p>
<p>Leeway quickly flipped through the blueprints. Judging from the speed of energy convergence and mode switching, the system s own reaction is not fast like a rusty giant ship starting up. But once the preparation is complete, the execution of cleanup could be very rapid. The method model deduction gives several probabilistic predictions. The most likely is that it releases a super strong directional energy pulse directly burning or overloading the energy structure of the target node.</p>
<p>The second is that it triggers a drastic change in the local space environment such as an instantaneous extreme low temperature, high pressure or strong current physically destroying the target. and there is a small probability that it releases some kind of information command that we cannot interpret directly causing the internal collapse of the target system. Either way, it would be a catastrophic disaster for the Caesar fleet caught in the crossfire. And for the Mo Yuan Pavilion, also marked as a low priority incidental entry and the potentially approaching Dragon Soul fleet, it would mean enormous and unpredictable risks. Is there any way to influence its target locking to make our priority lower or Caesar&#x27;s priority higher? Lyno asked the most crucial question.</p>
<p>Leewi and Su Chian exchange a glance. Leeway pushed up his glasses and spoke rapidly. Theoretically, yes. If we can simulate a stronger, more abnormal energy characteristic that is more destructive to the system stability and make the balancer think that this characteristic is highly correlated with or even homologous to Caesar&#x27;s energy source. We might be able to deceive the algorithm and direct the main elimination firepower more concentrated towards Caesar, but this requires extremely precise energy simulation and timing of deployment.</p>
<p>And the risk is extremely high. If the simulation fails or is detected, we might immediately become the highest priority target. Chan, can your senses distinguish the specific energy characteristic identification code of the target locked by the balancer? Even just a part of it? Linmo looked at Su Chanchchan. Such Chian bit her lower lip, closed her eyes again, and directed her perception into the cold, vast, and warming up depths of that will. This time, she no longer tried to understand the whole, but rather, like the most sensitive probe, tried to capture the subtle, distinctive differences in the energy flows that were heading toward different priority goals.</p>
<p>This was an extremely demanding and meticulous operation. Time ticked by. Her face grew paler and paler, and her body trembled more and more violently. Just as Lin Mo was about to tell her to give up, she suddenly opened her eyes, a glimmer of light flashing within them. There is a slight difference in the information flow heading towards Caesar.</p>
<p>Besides the high-intensity energy markers, there a very faint but extremely stubborn forced link characteristic like it was forcibly welded on incompatible with the system&#x27;s own energy full of violence and incoordination. The information flowing towards other lower priority targets however only shows simple abnormal energy disturbance markers that she gasped. That forced link characteristic feels very similar to Caesar s strangely patterned metal cylinders and the bioeny veins forcibly embedded in his pherommones before it has a fingerprint left by his technology. The fingerprint of Kaiser technology a sharp glint flashed in Lynmo&#x27;s eyes. This was a key that could be exploited.</p>
<p>Liebe, can we use our jammers or the energy of a rune tower to simulate this forced link characteristic? Even if it&#x27;s just for a moment to attach it to Caesar&#x27;s energy beam signal. Leewe quickly calculated in his mind veins throbbing on his forehead. We can try. The core principle of a jammer is resonant interference by adjusting the response medium and rune circuit. It is hoped that a similar characteristic waveform can be simulated briefly.</p>
<p>However, it requires real-time frequency data of the Caesar energy beam as a reference and the deployment must be extremely precise. The characteristic addition must be completed at the very moment before the balancer finally locks onto the target and initiates cleaning. Too early and it will be filtered out by the systems adaptive filtering. Too late and it will be too late. Real-time frequency data is shallow.</p>
<p>I can try to continuously sense the fluctuations of the Caesar energy beam, but the balancer is initiating the final moment of cleansing death. Ill make the judgment. Uh, Lynn Emmo interrupted her, his voice firm and decisive. Leeway, you immediately go and prepare to adjust the jammer and make a modified version that can simulate the characteristics of forced link in the shortest possible time. Shan Shian, concentrate and lock onto the fluctuations of the Caesar energy beam.</p>
<p>Once you sense that the energy convergence of the balancer has reached its peak and is about to explode, tell me immediately. He looked to sure how. Notify the entire ship to prepare for impact. All non-essential personnel should move to the core compartment for safety. At the same time, order flying fish and wavebreaker to carry the modified jammers and find an opportunity to approach to a position where they could be projected onto the edge of the Caesar energy beams transmission path.</p>
<p>Once they received my order, they must project the jammers at all costs. Orders were quickly relayed and the MO Yuan Pavilion War Machine began operating at high speed again under the shadow of the iceberg. However, this time their goal was not to defeat the enemy, but to gently adjust the direction of death&#x27;s finger amidst the devastating abyssal resonance. Beyond the iceberg, the wind and snow howled, and the low frequency hum grew clearer and clearer, as if a giant beast from the abyss was slowly opening its indifferent eyes, ready to cleanse. Chapter 71.</p>
<p>Critical instructions. Leeway locked himself in a temporarily emptied storage room on the lower deck of the Moyu On, which became his workshop for urgently modifying the jammer. Several emergency lights powered by energy storage crystals provided a pale but stable light source, illuminating the tools, materials, and a dozen or so dark gray metal discs scattered on the workbench. The air was filled with metal shavings, dissolved glue, and a faint pungent ozone-like odor emitted by the energy conducting materials during high-intensity energy adjustments. He sent his two apprentices to guard the door, leaving only the most clever one inside to assist, passing tools and recording data.</p>
<p>Leewi&#x27;s eyes were bloodshot, but his gaze was frighteningly bright, as if burning with some kind of desperate flame. In one hand, he held the waveform diagram of the Caesar energy beams forced link characteristics, which Sue Chanchan had just dictated and which his apprentice had sketched. In the other hand, he used an extremely fine carving knife to finally adjust the rune circuits on a disassembled jammer core the response medium block filled with blue vein crystal powder and energy conducting minerals. The arc angle here should be off by 0.5°. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>The texture connecting the third energy conducting node needs to be deepened, but it absolutely mustn&#x27;t touch the adjacent isolation layer, he muttered to himself as he operated, his forehead covered in sweat, which he didn&#x27;t bother to wipe away. The medium ratio needs to be increased by 3% obsidian powder to enhance its aggressiveness and inongruity in its energy characteristics, simulating the violent embedding effect of Caesar. The simple testing instrument on the workbench emitted a soft hum and flashes, displaying the response of the adjusted medium to the simulated waveform. Each failed attempt meant discarding a precious piece of response medium in a significant amount of time. But we hands were steady.</p>
<p>Failure did not discourage him, but instead brought him closer to the unsettling waveform characteristics that needed to be simulated. Meanwhile, in the relatively quiet bridge lounge, Su Chanchian sat cross-legged on the floor, a thick layer of fur beneath her. She no longer closed her eyes, but opened them wide, her pupils seemingly unfocused, her gaze piercing through the bulkhead and fixed on the distant and dangerous northeast. Her hands rested gently on the resonator Lee Wei had left behind on her knees. The devices hum gradually synchronizing with her own breathing.</p>
<p>She was tracking, locking onto, memorizing. Caesar&#x27;s relentless energy beams like a brutal scorching whip repeatedly lashed at the greedy nodes on the seabed, leaving clear whip marks on the surrounding environment, a unique, violently grafted frequency of fluctuation. Su Chanchian carefully used her senses to touch these whip marks, not resisting, but simply observing, memorizing, and familiarizing herself with each rise and fall, deeply imprinting them into her consciousness. At the same time, she also had to spare some attention to vigilantly monitor the movements of the deeper balancer. That cold vast will the focus of its energy convergence was becoming increasingly scorching and clear like a volcano about to erupt exuding a suffocating sense of oppression.</p>
<p>What she was looking for was the final most intense energy contraction and silence critical point before the volcano erupted. On deck and in the lower cabins, a different kind of orderly tension prevailed. Sherhow relocated the last group of non-combat personnel, mainly Lee Wei&#x27;s other apprentices, some clerical staff, and the wounded to the specially reinforced core compartment of midshipips. There, extra food, water, and medicine were stored, and the bulkheads were reinforced with additional wooden supports and cushioning, making it the safest place on the entire ship. The flying fish and breaking waves had completed their final checks and camouflage, and were quietly mored on the leeward side of the ink abyss.</p>
<p>10 selected special forces members, including Xiao Tai and Lu Fong, were fully armed, wearing speciallymade thick diving suits. Though rudimentary, they were better than nothing, and carrying weapons, tools, and several unmodified ordinary jammers that Leeway had previously manufactured as backup. They silently checked their equipment, flexing their fingers, which were somewhat stiff in the cold, and awaited the final orders. Sherhow personally reiterated the mission to them. At all costs, infiltrate as close as possible to the transmission path of the Caesar energy beam, await Linmo&#x27;s instructions, and then launch the modified special jammer that carried everyone&#x27;s hopes.</p>
<p>Time slipped away silently in the waiting and preparation. Every minute, every second seemed to be stretched out by the extreme cold and compressed by invisible pressure. About an hour and a half later, Leeway finally pushed open the door to the workshop. He held a dark gray disc in his hands that looked no different from the other jammers, but his eyes held an almost exhausting excitement. The theoretical simulation has been completed with a 78% accuracy rate.</p>
<p>The duration is only about 1.5 to 2 seconds. It must be triggered within the extremely short window between the balancer locking onto the target and the activation of cleanup to maximize its effect. He handed the disc to Shurehal. It was heavy and cold to the touch and the engravings on its surface seemed more complex and profound than before. How was it triggered? Is it still by impact or preset signal? Sure.</p>
<p>How asked it has been changed to a dual trigger? Leeway explained. The first layer is automatic sensing of the target s energy characteristics upon approach which is the foundation. The second layer adds a very simple resonance key. Chantian needs to use a perception to inject a specific guiding wave into the disc before launch resonating with the current frequency of a Caesar energy beam for final activation and aiming correction. This improves the accuracy of the deployment and the targeting of the feature simulation.</p>
<p>He looked at Sue Chanchan Chanchan I I&#x27;ll tell you about the keys fluctuation pattern later. It s very simple but you must complete it before the jammer launches and it can&#x27;t alert the balancer dot. Su Chian nodded slowly, indicating that she understood. Just then, the lookout who had been monitoring the external environment suddenly reported urgently. Northeast, a large-scale aurora phenomenon has appeared over the Caesar fleet.</p>
<p>No, it&#x27;s not an aurora. It&#x27;s an energy overflow. The whirlpool on the sea surface has expanded by at least double. We can hear a deep rumbling sound as if it&#x27;s coming from the deep seabed. Everyone&#x27;s spirits lifted and they immediately rushed to the observation window.</p>
<p>In the northeastern sky, the leaden clouds were reflected in an eerie mix of dark red and deep blue like a boiling furnace reflected on the heavens. On the sea, the enormous whirlpool was clearly visible, its edges churning with white foam and broken ice, its center unfathomably deep. And that deep rumbling sound seemingly emanating from the depths of the earth could be faintly heard even from this distance causing the mo yuan ship to tremble slightly in resonance. Is Caesar going to succeed or is he going to lose control? Luongo murmured. Such Chanchians expression grew even more serious.</p>
<p>She pressed down on the resonator. Her voice tense. The energy convergence of the balancer is almost at its peak. That focal point is frighteningly bright. Caesar&#x27;s energy beam is still intensifying.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s making his final sprint. The critical point is almost here. Lynamo took a deep breath of the icy air, his gaze sweeping over every face in the cabin. Some tense, some resolute, some weary. Sure, how take them in and set off.</p>
<p>Flying fish and wave breaker. Proceed according to plan. Find the optimal launch position and await my final instructions. Leewi, you and Shanhen stay on the bridge to maintain communication with the rune tower and dragon soul and be ready to deal with any emergencies at any time. All crew of the Mo Yu on enter maximum combat readiness and prepare to withstand the impact.</p>
<p>The order was given and no one hesitated. Shhal led his special forces team swiftly and silently off the ship and onto two small boats. The boats, like arrows released from a bow, once again disappeared into the shadows and snowstorms among the icebergs. Heading towards that energy-filled, perilous sea, Leeway sat down in front of the communicator and began trying to establish a more stable connection with the rune tower. Such Chian closed her eyes, immersing herself in the depths of her senses, keeping a close watch on the fluctuations of the Caesar energy beam while vigilantly staring at the balancer focus that was about to erupt.</p>
<p>Linmo stood alone at the very front of the bridge, looking in the direction where the flying fish and wave breaker had disappeared and then looking northeast at the sky and sea that seemed to be burning. The critical moment is approaching. The order has been given. The next step is to throw this meticulously planned move into the vortex of destruction and see if it can create even a ripple that changes fate. The abyss&#x27;s growl grows ever closer.</p>
<p>The judgment of the icy sea is about to unleash its first bolt of lightning. Chapter 72. The judgment of the ice sea. The flying fish and breaking waves. were like two shadows clinging to the sea.</p>
<p>Struggling to navigate through the increasingly menacing ice flows and turbulent energy currents. The snowstorm seemed to be intensified by the boiling energy field to the northeast. The ice crystals no longer fell vertically, but were pulled apart by an invisible force, tracing eerie spiral paths through the air. The seawater took on a sickly deep blue purple hue with tiny bubbles constantly bursting on the surface, emitting a faint, pungent odor of sulfur and ozone. Sherhow crouched at the bow of the flying fish, squinting as he stared intently ahead through the observation lenses, which were constantly covered in frost and quickly wiped away.</p>
<p>His heartbeat was steady and strong, but his palms, gripping the short telescope, were slightly sweaty as far as the eye could see. Beneath the dark red and eerie blue sky on the horizon, the outline of Caesar&#x27;s fleets circular formation flickered in and out of view amidst the energy glow and snowstorm. Like Willow the wisps encircling the entrance to hell. Even more chilling was the enormous vortex at the center of the formation, which had now expanded to a size large enough to engulf several large ships. The waves surging from the vortex&#x27;s edges reached heights of tens of meters, and a roar could be faintly heard even here.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re about 1.5 nautical miles from our destination. The old sailor at the helm reported horsely. He had to fight against the increasingly turbulent currents and the suction from the whirlpool. The current has changed direction and is pulling us that way. Also, there&#x27;s a lot of something underwater swimming very fast towards the whirlpool.</p>
<p>Even without him saying it, sure how could see it. From time to time, huge dorsal fins or twisted tentacles flashed across the sea surface. These were deep sea creatures driven by their final energy feast or their instinct for fear, frantically surging towards that whirlpool of death. Maintain course, full power, avoid large creatures. Sure, how roared.</p>
<p>The propellers of the two small boats paddled wildly, and the engines, small propellers powered by energy storage crystals and runes, which had been simply modified by Leewi, hummed under the strain, struggling against the increasingly strong environmental resistance. Such Chanchchan&#x27;s voice came through the small bone resonators worn in everyone&#x27;s ears, clearer than the sound of wind and snow, yet carrying a sense of exhaustion and tension. Balancer energy focus compression is about to saturate. The Caesar energy beam intensity has reached its peak and is still climbing. The critical point is very close.</p>
<p>You must hurry. Every word she spoke was like a drum beat striking the hearts of Sher How and every team member. Faster, faster, hard to port. Avoid that swarm of glowing jellyfish ahead. Luong urgently warned aboard the breaking waves.</p>
<p>To their left, a large group of giant jellyfish, over half a meter in diameter and emitting a ghastly white fluoresence, were drifting with the current. Their tentacles, several meters long, crackled with electricity as they moved. These were mutants spawned or attracted by abnormal energy. Encountering them would be a major problem. The two ships narrowly missed the edge of the jellyfish swarm.</p>
<p>One of the crew members on the flying fish was a little slow and his arm was brushed by a drifting tentacle. His thick waterproof suit was instantly pierced with a small hole and his skin felt a burning pain. He groaned and gritted his teeth to cut off the tentacle with his dagger. His teammates quickly applied the emergency neutralizing ointment that Lee Wayi had prepared him. Danger lurked everywhere, but the target was right ahead.</p>
<p>They could clearly see several astonishingly thick beams of energy interwoven with dark gold and blood red emanating from several special ships in a circular formation of Caesar&#x27;s fleet. Like colossal pillars supporting the heavens and earth, these beams continuously pounded into the center of the vortex, sinking into the unfathomable abyss. That was Caesar&#x27;s energy beams violently feeding the tentacles of the seabed. That&#x27;s it. Shurhow pointed to a relatively calm area about 800 meters ahead where the seawater was unusually deep in color.</p>
<p>That was the edge of the energy beam transmission path calculated based on Sue Chian&#x27;s previous perception and leeway&#x27;s model. If the jammer was projected there, it would have the highest probability of being scanned by the balancer and linked to its sore Caesar&#x27;s energy beam. Prepare the launcher. Check the jammer. Sure.</p>
<p>How ordered. A special forces soldier quickly set up a modified light crossbow with angle adjustment and a simple sight on the bow. Another soldier took out the modified jammer, which Lewi had placed high hopes on from a speciallymade insulated box. The dark gray disc was inconspicuous in the dim light, but when held in the hand, one could feel an extremely faint but unusually active energy pulse emanating from within. Shhal personally inserted the jammer into the crossbow&#x27;s firing slot and secured it.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath of the bone chilling air and said to the bone resonator, &quot;Chanchian, we&#x27;ve reached the designated position.&quot; Prepared to receive the resonance key for final activation. Inside the bridge of the Moon, Sue Chanchians body jolted violently. She had maintained a near split state of perception, simultaneously locking onto the raging Caesar energy beam and monitoring the energy focus of the balancer as it approached its peak. At this moment, she clearly saw that the focus, like the core of a supernova before its explosion, had reached its limits in both brightness and pressure, and its internal structure was undergoing a final decisive reorganization and locking. and Caesar&#x27;s energy beam, like the final fuel, was frantically being injected into it.</p>
<p>The tipping point is in the next second or the second after that. Without the slightest hesitation, she immediately channeled the simple resonance key that Lewi had told her a weak mental guide that mimicked the current main frequency fluctuation of a Caesar energy beam, but was supplemented with specific forced link harmonics through the bone resonator into the jammer in Shure House&#x27;s hand. Key transmission on the flying fish. A fleeting glimmer of dark red light suddenly appeared on the engravings on the surface of the dark gray disc, followed by a barely audible click sound from within, like a precision mechanism locking into place. The jammer had been activated.</p>
<p>It was now like a venomous stinger poised to strike, bearing the technological fingerprint of Caesar. Almost simultaneously ensued Shihan&#x27;s perception, the energy focus of the balancer completed its final compression and locking. A cold absolute and emotionless judgment will like an invisible ripple swept across the entire sea area in an instant. Now Sherhow had no time to think it through, relying entirely on his instincts hone through countless life and death battles and Su Chanchians silent urging filled with fear. A sense of urgency conveyed through perception.</p>
<p>He suddenly pulled the trigger of the crossbow. Boom! With a muffled thud, the crossbow string vibrated. The jammer carrying the hopes and calculations of everyone in the Mo Yuan pavilion trailed an almost invisible contrail as it traversed 800 m of space filled with turbulent energy and blizzards heading towards the designated dark waters. The jammer was silent when submerged in water. Tom seemed to freeze at that moment.</p>
<p>Sure, how Lu Fong, all the special forces members, and even Linmo and Leewi on the distant Mo Yuan ship held their breath, widened their eyes, and stared intently at the direction where the jammer landed, at the boiling energy field in the northeast, and at the huge vortex that seemed to have frozen for a moment. 1 second, 2 seconds. The anticipated flashes of light or sounds that might occur after the jammer was triggered did not appear. The waters remained deep with only the waves churning. It failed, did not trigger, or was it detected? Just as the third second was about to pass, and disappointment and even greater panic were about to surge into my heart.</p>
<p>Deep in the ocean, the balancer had just locked onto the destructive energy that was about to erupt, targeting the abnormal stimulus source group. The logic or algorithm flowing inside seemed to stutter very slightly. like a finely tuned instrument before outputting its final command. It receives two nearly overlapping target signals with slightly different feature weights. One signal, Caesar&#x27;s energy beam, is extremely strong and distinctive, bearing a strong forced link violent mark.</p>
<p>The other, a weak signal that has just been connected, a feature simulated by the jammer, has negligible strength, but its forced link violent mark is highly homologous to the main target signal and even appears more glaring and inongruous in certain details due to the deliberate simulation. for the balancer that executes the cleanup protocol to eliminate the greatest threat to system stability. Should these two highly correlated anomalous signals undergo correlation enhancement processing to ensure the thoroughess of the cleanup? This process of pause and reassessment may have taken only a fraction of a second in a non-human balancer consciousness. But it was this fraction of a second of hesitation and enhanced linkage that caused the already compressed and destructive energy about to crash into the source of the Caesar energy beam to have its focus resolution and tracking priority invisibly raised and sharpened again. It was like a shotgun originally aimed at the torso, but just before firing, the crosshair was slightly raised by an invisible hand, aiming more precisely at the head.</p>
<p>The next moment, there was no deafening explosion, no dazzling burst of light. The boiling dark red and eerie blue light in the northeastern sky and sea suddenly contracted and collapsed for a moment, as if the entire space had been sucked away. Immediately afterwards, a humming vibration indescribable in sound and seemingly acting directly on the soul and the material world suddenly spread out from the huge vortex at the center of the Caesar fleet circular formation. Instead of creating giant waves, the seawater was struck as if by an invisible hammer, instantly caved in, forming a terrifying funnel-shaped crater far larger than before. All the sea beasts, ice flows, and even the few Caesar special ships at the innermost edge of the formation, which were exerting their full energy output rushed towards the whirlpool.</p>
<p>Under this irresistible judgment from the deep sea, they didn&#x27;t even have time to struggle before being silently erased and dragged into the suddenly appearing bottomless dark abyss. Those thick dark gold and blood red energy beams that connected heaven and earth suddenly extinguished and disintegrated from the middle like blood vessels severed by a sharp blade. The blinding flashes and violent shock waves generated by the energy backlash instantly swept around the outer perimeter of Caesar&#x27;s fleet circular formation. The world lost its color and the icy sea trembled. The judgment has arrived in a way that far exceeded anyone&#x27;s expectations.</p>
<p>Chapter 73. Aftermath of the judgment. The judgment. Power from the depths of the sea did not continue to erupt. Like a precise and deadly heartbeat.</p>
<p>After a moment of violent contraction and release, it quickly returned to a deeper and more unsettling silence. The eerie glow of crimson and dark blue mingle with the sky, replaced by thick, letting gray to black clouds that seem to absorb all light. Pressing low over the turbulent sea. In the center of the ocean, the terrifying funnel-shaped crater nearly a kilometer in diameter and the one that had swallowed the core of Caesar&#x27;s fleet was being filled inwards by a tidal wave of seawater, producing a continuous, deafening roar like a stampede of horses or the groaning of the earth. The massive amounts of seaater crashing and compressing created hundreds of meters high, murky white walls of water that spread wildly in all directions.</p>
<p>The shock wave arrived faster than sound. Even the flying fish and wave breaker nearly two nautical miles away were violently lifted and tossed about like leaves in a storm. Sure how gripped the ships railing tightly. Feeling as if his internal organs had shifted, his ears ringing, unable to hear anything but the destructive roar between the sea and sky, he saw the wave breaker violently rocking on the adjacent wave crest, nearly capsizing, its crew tumbling in a heap, only kept from being thrown out by ropes and safety harnesses. Hold on.</p>
<p>Hold on tight. Shh roared with all his might. But even he couldn&#x27;t hear his own voice. A turbid, massive wave carrying fragments of ice, twisted metal, and indistinguishable charred organic debris, rolled in like a tsunami. Two small boats struggled desperately in the turbulent waters, tossed to the crest of a wave, then plunging into its trough, each second in danger of being completely swallowed or smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>Driven by their survival instincts and rigorous training, the sailors steered their oars and makeshift rudders with all their might, trying to steer the boats towards the direction of the waves and reduce the stress on their sides. The physical aftershocks of this deep sea judgment lasted for nearly 10 minutes before gradually weakening into merely an exceptionally violent surge. When the flying fish and breaking waves finally managed to stabilize themselves on the churning sea, everyone was soaked to the bone, pale-faced, and many were injured, vomiting or gasping violently by the ship&#x27;s side. Sherhow wiped the cold sea water and blood foam from his eyes. He didn&#x27;t know where he had cut himself and hurriedly looked around.</p>
<p>Both ships were still there, although the holes were damaged in many places and the mass were bent. The core structure didn&#x27;t seem to have collapsed. He quickly counted the crew and his heart sank. Two people were missing from the flying fish, thrown out by the first giant wave and were nowhere to be seen. Three people were also seriously injured on the wave breaker, but they were all on board.</p>
<p>Before he could grieve, Sha forced himself to turn his gaze toward the direction of Caesar&#x27;s fleet. The sight before him made even this seasoned and tough man gasp in shock. The sea looked as if it had just witnessed a natural disaster. The massive whirlpool had vanished, leaving the surface churned and ravaged, littered with countless pieces of broken planks, canvas, twisted metal components, and all sorts of bizarre char debris. Several relatively intact Caesar warships farther from the explosion&#x27;s epicenter were now spinning like drunkards, their sails torn, mass snapped, and flames erupting from multiple hatches, clearly out of power and control.</p>
<p>Further away, some ships that had miraculously escaped the epicenter were frantically adjusting their course, attempting to escape this death trap. Their formation completely broken. As for the special ships that were originally at the core of the circular formation and responsible for energy output, as well as most of the bloodshar class main force, they have completely disappeared along with the seawater and icebergs in that area, leaving only a terrifying bottomless void that is being rapidly filled by turbid seawater and foam mixed with oil and unknown substances churning on the surface of a sea. They succeeded. They really succeeded.</p>
<p>That tiny disruptor, like a grain of sand precisely inserted into the gears, induced the balancer&#x27;s judgment to fall on Caesar&#x27;s own head with far greater intensity and precision than expected. But at this moment, sure how felt little joy, only the lingering fear of surviving a disaster, and a deep awe in the face of nature&#x27;s, or rather in human powers, raging fury. They had utilized this power, but had almost been buried along with its aftershocks. Team leader Shure, shall we continue the mission? A special forces soldier with abrasions on his face asked weekly. Sherhow shook his head, grabbed the soaked bone resonator, and tried to contact the Moan.</p>
<p>The signal was weak and filled with static, but it was still barely usable. Moan, this is flying fish. Judgment in effect. Caesar core destroyed. Fleet scattered.</p>
<p>We have lost two men and our ship is damaged. Requesting evacuation orders. A moment later, Lyn Mo&#x27;s voice came through intermittently, equally tense and suppressed. Received. Evacuate immediately according to the third contingency plan.</p>
<p>Pay attention to sea conditions and the MOU on will provide support. Understood. Sure. How cut off the communication and immediately order the two ships. Abandon all unnecessary equipment.</p>
<p>Travel light. Retreat at full speed. Follow the third contingency plan. route back to the Moon. The ship started again, dragging its battered body and headed towards the rendevous point agreed upon with the MON.</p>
<p>Looking back at the sea that looked like it had been trampled by a giant, the flames, thick smoke, floating wreckage, and a panicked shadows of surviving ships against the backdrop of the leaden sky and surging waves created an apocalyptic scene. The atmosphere was equally somber inside the bridge of the Moan. Lyn Mo stood before the observation window, slowly lowering the binoculars in his hand. Despite the greater distance, the terrifying vision of the judgment and the annihilation of Caesar&#x27;s fleet was still faintly visible through the wind, snow, and waves. Had it succeeded from a strategic perspective, yes.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s long planned, dangerous operation against the ancient underwater entity had been completely thwarted. Its core forces and fleet had suffered severe damage and were unlikely to pose a significant threat in the short term. But what was the price? The two team members who were forever left in the ICC. Such Chanhian had completely collapsed from exhaustion after sending out the resonance key and was currently being urgently cared for by Lee Wayi and the ship&#x27;s doctor. Her face was deathly pale and her breathing was weak.</p>
<p>yuon itself was also affected by the shock wave and the hall emitted unsettling creaking sounds with some of the recently repaired damage potentially cracking again. More importantly, they had personally guided or rather deceived a destructive force they could neither comprehend nor control. This time the target was Caesar. What about next time? This experience was like stealing a jewel from the mouth of a sleeping dragon. A lucky success, but the aftershocks of the dragon&#x27;s unintentional sway of its tail nearly cost them their lives.</p>
<p>Boss Leewi, after settling Such Chanin, walked over to Lynmo. His face was also grim, showing both exhaustion from overexertion and fear of the unknown power. The rune tower s remote monitoring shows that after activating judgment, the balancer experienced a sharp drop in energy levels, re-entering a deep silence or cooling off state. The activity of the greed node has also decreased significantly. The overall ancient fluctuations on the seabed have become more subdued and stable than before, almost like satisfaction.</p>
<p>Or is it just weakness after excessive consumption? What about those pillars on the seabed? Lynmo asked. It is slowly sinking and dissipating. The energy characteristics are returning to the fatigue base. Leewi replied. The entire system seems to have temporarily restored some kind of balance through this cleansing.</p>
<p>But the traces of forced linking may still be there and the system estate itself has changed. Balance was restored but a scar remained along with a vast disturbed unknown. Lynn Mo remained silent. At that moment the communicator rang again reporting that Sherow&#x27;s team had safely arrived at the rendevous point and was returning. Linmo turned around and looked at the other members on the bridge who were equally exhausted but whose eyes were filled with complex emotions.</p>
<p>The joy of victory, the sorrow of losing comrades, the fear of unknown forces, and the bewilderment of surviving a disaster. Notify everyone. Lynmo&#x27;s voice wasn&#x27;t loud, but it carried clearly across the bridge. We&#x27;re returning to port, but this isn&#x27;t the end. Clean up the battlefield, treat the wounded, repair the ships, and take stock of the losses.</p>
<p>Leewi, continue monitoring the energy changes on the seabed. Once Shianne wakes up, we need to know her last sensations. Also, he paused, gazing northeastward at the sea, gradually being shrouded again by wind, snow, and night. The embers of Caesar&#x27;s fleet flickered in the darkness like the embers of hell. Sent a message to Chi Duo Duo, instructing him to utilize all available intelligence networks to confirm Caesar&#x27;s fate.</p>
<p>The Storm King sword, wielded for the first time in such an indirect and perilous manner, fell a powerful foe. But the shadows beneath the icy sea did not dissipate. They merely retreated into deeper darkness. The stories of the survivors and the fates of the defeated will continue to be written in the aftermath. Chapter 74.</p>
<p>Looking back from the ashes. The Emo Yuan dragging its damaged hull embarked on its return journey amidst the gradually calming yet still turbulent waves and the incessant snowstorm. The resolute tension of its arrival was replaced by a complex emotion mixed with heaviness, exhaustion, and a faint sense of relief. The fruits of victory were stained with the blood of the fallen and also with a deep awe of that uncontrollable power. Su Chian didn&#x27;t wake up until the morning of the second day after returning to port.</p>
<p>She found herself lying on a soft bed in the bridge lounge covered with thick fur. A small stove beside her was warming herbal soup which emitted a bitter but comforting aroma. sunlight on a rare sunny day, shown through the melting frost on the observation window, casting thin beams of light in which dust moes floated quietly. She tried to move her fingers and a strong feeling of weakness and a throbbing pain deep in her mind made her take a deep breath. Memories flooded back like a tide.</p>
<p>The frigid cold of the icy sea, the raging energy beams, the cold and vast will of the balancer, and finally the allout guidance of the resonance key, followed by boundless darkness. The cabin door was gently pushed open, and Lyno walked in carrying a bowl of hot porridge. Seeing that her eyes were open, he paused for a moment, then quickened his pace to the bedside. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; He put the porridge aside, reached out, and touched her forehead. The temperature was normal, but it was ice cold to the touch.</p>
<p>It feels like I&#x27;ve been hollowed out. Su Chanchian&#x27;s voice was as she forced a smile. It also feels like I&#x27;ve had a very long and exhausting dream. Do we succeed? It&#x27;s a success. Lynn Emma nodded, handed her the bowl of porridge and watched her swallow it in small sips.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s core fleet and those special equipment were directly wiped out by the judgment at the bottom of the sea. The outer fleet was routed and suffered heavy losses. Sure. How and the others witnessed it firsthand. Su Chanchian quietly sipped her porridge, the warmth sliding down her throat, slightly dispelling the chill in her body.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t ask for details. Perhaps it was better not to hear about that scene and the price. Lyn Mo was silent for a moment. Flying fish lost two crew members. The others all had injuries of varying degrees.</p>
<p>The hall was also severely damaged. You overexerted yourself. Leewi said, &quot;You need a rest for at least a week and can no longer use heart of the ocean for highintensity perception.&quot; Suchinia nodded, not trying to be brave. She knew her own situation that balancer. And what about underwater? How are they now? Leewi has been monitoring it.</p>
<p>After the judgment, the energy level of the entire system dropped significantly, entering a deep silence. The manifested pillars also dissipated. The overall fluctuations became very low and stable like a deeper hibernation after excessive consumption. Lynn Mo paused. But Lewi also warned that the systems state has changed.</p>
<p>The traces of forced linking and the experience of this stress cleansing may make it react differently to similar abnormal stimuli in the future. We need to be more careful. Dot. Suchan understood the weight of those words. They had managed to take advantage of the rules this time, but the rules themselves had already noticed them.</p>
<p>These dust particles and Caesar, she asked another crucial question. Lynn Mo shook his head. She and Duo Duo used all his intelligence networks, including information shared with Dragon Soul. There is currently no conclusive evidence that Caesar is dead. His flagship, the Blood Fury, was on the outer edge of the circular formation and was severely damaged in the energy backlash and tsunami caused by Judgment.</p>
<p>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have been directly swallowed up. Some fleeing wings of freedom sailors claimed to have seen the blood fury fleeing north towards the broken eye zone in the chaos, but this cannot be confirmed. Dragon souls reconnaissance units discovered new ship wreckage and battle traces in that area. But the blizzard is too severe, making tracking difficult. Caesar might still be alive.</p>
<p>This thought made the atmosphere, which had just eased heavy again. Such an ambitious, ruthless enemy who also possessed some dangerous technology would only be able to make a comeback if given a chance to regroup. What&#x27;s the dragon soul side saying? Such Chanchin asked. Xiao Ji gang sent formal congratulations and thanks, acknowledging our crucial role in this crisis. They are organizing forces to clear and take over some of the sea areas and resource points left behind after Caesar&#x27;s collapse.</p>
<p>They also reminded us that although the wings of freedom have suffered heavy losses, their foundations are not completely destroyed and Caesar&#x27;s fate is unknown. So, we need to be wary of retaliation. They propose that after we return, we hold a higher level meeting to discuss establishing a more robust joint defense line and follow-up actions against the remaining forces of the Wings of Freedom. Lyno took the bowl of porridge and put it aside. What do you think? Such Chanchian leaned against the pillows and thought for a while.</p>
<p>Unity is necessary. We can&#x27;t hold on to such a huge victory on our own. Nor can we deal with a possible counterattack from Caesar or other forces. But the methods and boundaries of cooperation need to be carefully discussed. Dragon Soul has an official background and order, but they also have their own interests and considerations.</p>
<p>A hint of approval flashed in Linmo&#x27;s eyes. Having experienced so much, Su Chian was no longer the girl student who only cared about marine life. She had begun to develop a strategic vision. That&#x27;s the same idea of mine, cooperation, but maintaining independence and initiative. We&#x27;ll discuss the specifics in detail with Chin Duo Duo and Shhow when we get back.</p>
<p>At this moment, Sherhow knocked and entered. He had unhealed abrasions on his face, but his spirits were still good. Seeing that Sue Chanchian was awake, he breathed a sigh of relief and gave a brief report. The damage assessment is complete and the funeral arrangements for the fallen team members have been initially handled according to regulations. The wounded are in stable condition.</p>
<p>The ship damage assessment report is here. It will require major repairs after returning to the island, especially the collision damage to the starboard side and the structural stress damage to part of the keel. In addition, some valuable floating debris was brought back from the edge of the battlefield, mainly fragments of the holes of Caesar&#x27;s special ships and some partially damaged energy transmission components. They have been sealed and are eager for Leeway to study. Furthermore, Sherhow added, &quot;As we were evacuating, we saw from afar that Dragon Solless rapid response fleet had already arrived at the periphery of the battlefield, gathering prisoners, salvaging wreckage, and establishing temporary control points.</p>
<p>They were moving very quickly. Doth Dragon Souls strength and efficiency have once again been demonstrated. This also means that the division of spoils after the war will not be easy. Understood. When we get back, prioritize repairing the ships, providing compensation to the families of the victims, and rewarding those who have contributed, Linmo said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Well discuss the rest when we get back to the island. Sherha accepted the order and left. Such Chian gazed out the window at the gradually familiar scenery of the sea area controlled by the Mo Yuan Pavilion. The outlines of distant islands were faintly visible under the clear sky after the snowfall. The direction of home, &quot;Did we win this time?&quot; she asked softly.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo also looked out the window, remaining silent for a long time. &quot;We won a crucial battle, destroying the enemy&#x27;s most dangerous plans and most of the manpower, but the war may have only just begun.&quot; Caesar&#x27;s ambitions, the secrets of the seabed, the truth behind this world. There are still many mysteries. He turned a look at Sue Chanchan. But at least we&#x27;ve gained time, space to grow and expand, and more comrades to fight alongside us.</p>
<p>Su Chanchian nodded, gazing at the island that was getting closer and closer. On the pier, a group of people seemed to have gathered, among whom the chubby figure pacing back and forth was particularly eye-catching. It was Chien Duo Duo. The flames of the icy sea have been temporarily extinguished, but within the embers lie the embers of an undying fire, nurturing the hope of new life. The returning ships, bearing both scars and glory, sail towards the homeland they built with their own hands and swore to protect.</p>
<p>But new challenges and choices await at their doorstep. Chapter 75 returned to the new chapter. When the sails of the Mo Yuan ship appeared on the horizon, the docks on Mo Yuan Pavilion Island were already in an uproar. Chin Duo Duo paced back and forth on the makeshift platform like an ant on a hot plate, repeatedly raising and lowering his moninocular telescope. Behind him, the islanders, who had spontaneously gathered upon hearing the news, crowded the open space at the dock, eagerly awaiting news.</p>
<p>When a familiar battledamaged yet still majestic black ship slowly entered the harbor, a deafening cheer and applause erupted from the crowd, many with tears in their eyes. The ship docked and the gang way was lowered. Linmo was the first to disembark. His figure appeared somewhat weary in the morning light, but his spine was ramrod straight. Following closely behind was sure how supporting Sue Chanchian, who was still weak, but insisted on walking on her own.</p>
<p>Behind them were the team members carrying the wounded various boils of war and wreck specimens. She duo duo practically pounced on them. His chubby face a mix of laughter and tears. Boss Captain Sure. Misu you&#x27;re finally back.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re back. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re back. He spoke incoherently, looking everyone over. And when he saw the injuries on their bodies and their barely concealed exhaustion, he couldn&#x27;t help but choke up again. All right, Fatty Chin.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s so many people watching. Sure. How patted his shoulder, his voice a little horse. Is everything all right at home? Good. All good.</p>
<p>The defenses have been reinforced several times. The rune tower is running smoothly. The workshops are working day and night, and the supplies are plentiful. Chin duo duo wiped his face, instantly switching back to his shrewd manager mode. Hot water and meals have been prepared long ago, and the medical team is waiting, too.</p>
<p>Quick, let the wounded and the brothers get some rest. Under Chiian Dedwa&#x27;s command, the doc bustled with orderly activity. The wounded were carefully carried to the medical area, and returning soldiers were greeted and embraced by their families and comrades. Amidst cheers, captured supplies and wreckage were labeled and transported to designated warehouses and research areas. An atmosphere of relief and the warmth of home permeated the island.</p>
<p>Leno did not go to rest immediately. He asked Shir how and Sue Chanchian to settle down first while he took Chin Duod Duo and Leewi. The latter rushed ashore as soon as the ship docked to the council hall in the inner fortress which had been reopened and was warm with a fireplace. Tell me what changes have occurred at home and outside during the days we&#x27;ve been away. Lyn Mo sat in the main seat, took a sip of hot tea and dispelled the chill in his bones.</p>
<p>Chandu Duo immediately opened the thick ledger he carried with him. Everything is stable at home. The ruin tower operated smoothly on its own while I gone was away. The early warning system successfully detected three small scale sea monsters approaching abnormally, all of which were easily dealt with by the patrol team. The workshop produced a large amount of winter supplies and weapon parts as planned, and the warehouse is already full.</p>
<p>As for trade, as you instructed before, we have quietly absorbed many scattered skilled craftsmen and survivors with special skills. Now, the total population on the island has exceeded 1,200, and the talent pool has been greatly enriched. What about the outside? Lyn Emmo asked. The news spreads incredibly fast. Chindwood was small eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>Although the details of the icy judgment are unclear, the news of Caesar&#x27;s main fleet&#x27;s annihilation and the wings of freedom&#x27;s severe damage has already spread throughout the surrounding seas through various channels. The story of how our Mo Yuan Pavilion and Dragon Soul joined forces to thwart Caesar&#x27;s conspiracy and save the seas has also spread. Right now, our reputation in the regional channels is soaring. Many small and medium-sized forces have taken the initiative to send goodwill, requesting trade or hoping to establish contact. Of course, there are also some discordant voices suspecting that we use some forbidden methods or trying to take the opportunity to probe the truth.</p>
<p>A tall tree catches the wind. That&#x27;s inevitable. Lin Mo nodded. Have you officially made contact with Dragon Soul? Captain Xiao Jang sent an official envoy 3 days ago. An agitant surname Joe with congratulatory gifts and a secret letter to Chandu Duo took out a sealed metal tube from his pocket.</p>
<p>The letter is here. Agitant Joe was very polite, saying that the Dragon Soul leadership was very satisfied with this cooperation and hoped to hold a highle meeting as soon as possible to finalize the details of subsequent cooperation. In addition, they mentioned that they discovered some interesting things while clearing the battlefield and gathering the defeated soldiers, and they wanted to share them with us. Lynamo took the metal tube, but didn&#x27;t open it immediately. He looked at Leewi and asked, &quot;Have you made any preliminary discoveries in your research?&quot; Leewi, who had been waiting impatiently, immediately said, &quot;Yes, a major discovery.</p>
<p>The metal debris brought back from the battlefield.&quot; After preliminary scanning and comparative analysis by the rune tower confirms that its material technology and energy conduction methods belong to the same but higher level system as the bioeny hybrid crystals and forced linking technology used by Caesar before, especially the several relatively complete energy conversion components. The intricate and complex internal rune structures far exceed our current level. More importantly, he lowered his voice, barely containing his excitement. I found some very fine, unnaturally formed engravings on the inner walls of some of the wreckage, like some kind of numbering or markings. Although incomplete, the structural style is similar to some ancient characters in the rune manual we obtained from the stonem&#x27;s brotherhood.</p>
<p>The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood, Linmo&#x27;s eyes narrowed. Could it be that Caesar&#x27;s technology was truly related to this mysterious organization? Or did they all acquire knowledge from some ancient shared source? Continue the research, but be extremely careful and take necessary isolation and protective measures. Lynn Mo instructed these technologies may contain unknown risks. Also, try cross referencing with the Rune Towers records to see if you can find any more connections. Clear.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Moyuang Island was immersed in a busy yet orderly process of recovery and reflection. The funerals of the fallen were solemnly held and their names were inscribed on the newly erected memorial wall in the inner fortress. Their families received generous compensation and promises. The wounded gradually recovered under careful care. After rest and recuperation, Sue Chanchians complexion improved significantly.</p>
<p>Although Leewei still strictly forbade her from overusing her abilities, she was now able to move normally and began assisting in organizing and reviewing all the data she had sensed during this trip to the ice sea regarding the ancient underwater entities and the balancer. This data would become invaluable information for the Mo Yuan pavilion in dealing with similar threats in the future. Shirhal led his men to focus on repairing the Mo Yuon and other damaged ships. The battle damage assessment was more severe than expected, especially since the keel of the Mo Yuan required extensive reinforcement, which would take time and a large amount of highquality timber. Fortunately, among the captured wreckage of the Caesar, there were many specially treated tough pieces of wood and metal components that could be recycled.</p>
<p>Chiand Duo Duo was extremely busy handling internal resource allocation and personnel placement, dealing with a barrage of messages and probing from the outside and preparing for a formal meeting with the dragon soul. He fully demonstrated his shrewd businessman nature, striving to secure the greatest possible benefits for the Mo Yuan pavilion in trade and diplomacy. A week later, Su Chanchian had basically recovered and the main repairs of the Mo Yuan were mostly completed. Linmo finally opened Xiao Ji Gangs secret letter. In the letter, Xiao Ji Gang in his capacity as the head of Dragon Souls Southeast Sea region formally invited LandMo to Dragon Souls a forward base on Rock Island for final negotiations and signing of a strategic cooperation framework agreement.</p>
<p>The letter outlined the core contents of the draft agreement, an intelligence sharing mechanism, principles of military cooperation, including mutual support and joint operations, the scope of technical exchanges limited to non-core areas, and a joint plan to eliminate the remaining forces of the Wings of Freedom. In addition, the letter included a brief intelligence sharing. Dragon Souls reconnaissance units discovered what appears to be the final sinking site of Caesar&#x27;s flagship, the Blood Rage deep within the shattered ice zone. Signs of intense fighting were present, but no body of Caesar himself or definitive evidence of escape was found. Simultaneously, they detected a significant increase in activity from the Stonemason Brotherhood, particularly near several known ancient ruins with their movements unclear.</p>
<p>Finally, Xiao Ji Gang reminded Linmo in his personal capacity. Although Caesar was defeated, his followers are not all gone and his ambition has not been extinguished. Moreover, the mystery of the deep sea involved a wide range of issues. So, I hope you&#x27;ll be cautious and take it seriously. Dragon Soul is willing to join hands with Mo Yuan Pavilion to maintain the peace of this seer.</p>
<p>The letter&#x27;s contents were as expected. Dragon Soul demonstrated sufficient sincerity and a pragmatic attitude, but also clearly defined its dominant position and the boundaries of interests in the cooperation. Caesar&#x27;s fate remained uncertain. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was stirring. The secrets of the deep sea remained unresolved and the external environment remained complex.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo convened the core members, conveyed the content of the letter, and discussed countermeasures. It was ultimately decided that Linmo would personally lead a team accompanied by Sherhao Chin Duo Duo and a few elite guards to Rock Island for formal talks with Dragon Soul. Su Chian and Leewi would remain on the island to handle internal affairs and continue their research. On the eve of his departure, Lynn Emmo arrived alone at the top of the rune tower. The tower&#x27;s faint light flowed silently through the night sky, illuminating the islands dotted with lights below, while the distant sea shimmerred peacefully.</p>
<p>Compared to the devastating storm that had struck the icy sea not long ago, it felt like a world apart. Suian had also come up at some point and stood beside him. Are you leaving? Okay, go and settle the things that need to be discussed. Lyn Mo looked at the starry sky. I&#x27;ll leave the family to you and Leewi.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry. Su Chian leaned gently on his shoulder, feeling the cool night breeze and the warmth from the person beside her. We&#x27;ll protect them. You be careful, too. Dragon Soul is an ally, but it&#x27;s still a large organization.</p>
<p>I know that Lyno put his arm around her shoulder. This trip is both for cooperation and to get a feel for things. We need to develop and that requires dealing with the outside world. But we must firmly hold our bottom line and fundamental principles in our own hands. thought.</p>
<p>The two silently gazed at the night view of their homeland. The future might hold countless storms, but at least for this moment, they had each other, this land they had built together, and the precious respit and upward mobility they had gained after World War I. After the battle in the ICC, the Mo Yuan Pavilion officially joined the ranks of the top powers in the sea. Now, upon their return, a new chapter is slowly unfolding beneath their feet. Challenges and opportunities coexist, and this time they will be more composed and more determined.</p>
<p>Chapter 76. The Covenant of Rock. The voyage to Rock Island was completely different from the previous lifethreatening journey deep into the icy sea. The Moan had undergone emergency reinforcement. Although some deep structural damage would require extensive repairs upon returning to the island, it was no longer a major obstacle for short voyages.</p>
<p>On the main mast, the flags representing the king of storms and the Mo Yuan pavilion fluttered in the early summer sea breeze. The hull, cleaned and simply repaired, had washed away most of the traces of battle, revealing a sturdy and imposing black texture. A relatively stable ocean energy map transmitted remotely from the rune tower provided guidance for navigation, helping them avoid several turbulent areas that might have been affected by the ICC events. Lynn Emmo stood on the deck, gazing at the azure sea and the scattered islands in the distance. The sunlight warmed him, bringing a long lost comfort, a stark contrast to the recent extreme cold.</p>
<p>But his gaze remained sharp and calm, unwavering. Sherhow, standing nearby, inspected several pieces of equipment on board, presented as samples and a display of sincerity, including a simplified version of Leewi&#x27;s improved silent ripple generator and several specially treated metal plates salvaged from Caesar&#x27;s wreckage. Chanduo, meanwhile, was huddled in the cabin, finalizing the draft terms of the negotiations with Dragon Soul and a list of possible supplies for exchange. His chubby face alternated between excitement and furrowed brows as he muttered to himself. &quot;Have you heard of Dragon Soulless Rock Island before?&quot; Sh house said as he walked to Lynn and Westside.</p>
<p>It has one of the earliest and largest comprehensive forward bases they established in the southeast Sea. It has said to have a permanent population of over 5,000 and a complete defense system, shipyards, workshops, and trading markets. It has one of the key hubs of order in this sea area. Choosing a location for the talks is both a demonstration of strength and a sign of acceptance. Lynn Emmo nodded slightly.</p>
<p>We need the information channels and a certain level of security that such a hub provides. But we cannot be completely bound by its rules. This time we need to not only obtain the benefits of cooperation but also see clearly how Dragon Souls rules actually operate and where the bottom line is. That Xiao Gi gang seems like a pragmatic person. Sherhow commented, &quot;Pragmatic, but it also represents the will of Dragon Soul as a whole.&quot; Lyn Mo&#x27;s gaze was far-reaching.</p>
<p>Personal likes and dislikes have limited weight in the face of organizational interests. What we need to cooperate with is the entity Dragon Soul, not just Xiao Ji Gang as an individual. After sailing for two days and one night, on the morning of the third day, the outline of Panser Island appeared on the horizon. It was an island far larger than the main island of Mo Yuan Pavilion, towering high in the center with densely packed buildings and dock facilities along its shore. Most striking with a continuous stone defensive walls and watchtowers built along the mountain side.</p>
<p>Their thick walls gleaming with a luster of metal reinforcement. The docks were bustling with activity, mass like a forest, and ships of all sizes moving in and out in an orderly fashion. A huge flag embroidered with a golden dragon fluttered above the fortress at top the island&#x27;s highest point. Several nautical miles from the island, a medium-sized patrol sailboat flying the dragon soul flag approached, signaling its identity with light signals before leading the way. The waterway was clearly well cleared and maintained with sufficient depth and clear buoy indications.</p>
<p>The Mo Yuan followed the guide ship, slowly entering a specially reserved birth in the main dock area. On the dock, a squad of spirited dragon soul soldiers in uniform leather armor were already lined up, accompanied by several people who appeared to be civilian officials. Lynn Emmo straightened his clothes, a solidly made simple dark-colored outfit covered with a dark patterned cloak symbolizing his status and was the first to descend the gang way. Sherhow and Shin Duo Duo followed closely behind. Eight carefully selected, equally neatly dressed guards, holding unloaded crossbows, stood solemnly at the side of the ship, not disembarking, serving both as a ceremonial guard in a display of self-restraint.</p>
<p>Welcome to Rock Island. Lord Linmo and his entourage. A refined looking man around 40 years old stepped forward, cupped his hands, and smiled. My name is Zhao Wuan, the agiton of Captain Xiaoi Gang. I am here to await your arrival on the captain&#x27;s orders.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Zhao, you&#x27;re too kind. Thank you for waiting so long. Lynn Mo returned the greeting with a cupped hand, neither humble nor arrogant. Captain Xiao is currently handling some urgent military affairs at the command post, and we&#x27;ll meet with you shortly. Before that, let me arrange for you all to rest and give you a brief introduction to the base.</p>
<p>What do you think? Zhao Yuan&#x27;s attitude was warm and considerate. When in Rome, do as the host does. Thank you for your help, Lieutenant Zhao. Led by Zhao Wy Yuan Linmo and his companions boarded a covered wagon with a simple carriage pulled by two strong pack animals and headed towards the island along a smooth stone road. What they saw along the way made even Lin Mo and the others who were mentally prepared secretly marvel at the dragon souls organizational capabilities and resources.</p>
<p>Along both sides of the road, buildings of various functions stood side by side. Neat barracks, steaming workshops, medical clinics filled with the aroma of herbs, schools where the sound of students reading aloud could be heard, teaching basic literacy, arithmetic, and survival skills, and bustling trading markets. Although there were many pedestrians, they moved quickly, each doing their own thing with few idlers. The streets were clean, the drainage ditches were well-maintained, and one could even see people specifically responsible for cleaning them. Soldiers patrolled in orderly steps, their eyes alert.</p>
<p>Pansure Island currently has about 5,300 permanent residents, including 2,000 combat and support personnel, 800 artisans of various kinds, and the rest are family members and people engaged in logistics, trade, education, etc. Zhao Yuan introduced with great familiarity. We have established a preliminary contribution point system. Residents can earn contribution points by working, fighting or providing technology or resources and then exchange these points for food, clothing, shelter and various services. The more you work, the more you earn, which helps maintain basic order and productivity.</p>
<p>A contribution point system. Lin Moe&#x27;s heart stirred. This coincided with some vague ideas in his mind, but Dragon Soul had obviously systematized and implemented it. That&#x27;s our main shipyard and workshop area. Zhao Yuan pointed to an area enclosed by high walls, from which came the sounds of heavy hammering and steam hissing.</p>
<p>It can maintain and build multiple medium-sized warships simultaneously, and also produce most standard weapons and tools. Oh, and over there is the planting and livestock area. Utilizing some improved technologies and limited green houses, it can barely supply some fresh vegetables, meat, and eggs. Most of our grain still needs to be purchased or traded. The caravan eventually stopped in front of a three-story building constructed of massive stones located halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>The building was rugged and sturdy and soldiers guarded the entrance. This is the reception hall for honored guests. The conditions are simple. Please forgive us. Za Yuan led the group inside.</p>
<p>The interior was spacious and although the furniture was simple, it was sturdy and durable. The walls were covered with nautical charts and maps of regional power distribution, and the floor was covered with thick felt, dispelling the chill of the stone house. Each room was equipped with a separate fireplace and ventilation vent. Please take a short rest. Your toiletries and meals will be delivered shortly.</p>
<p>Captain Xiao will come to visit me personally after he finishes his business. After arranging everything, Zhao Yuan politely took his leave. After closing the door, Chandu Duo immediately went to the window and carefully observed the layout and patrol routes outside. He whispered, &quot;This place is heavily guarded and well planned. It is indeed the old layer that Dragon Soul has been operating for a long time.</p>
<p>Just by looking at this setup, it is not something that ordinary forces can compare to.&quot; Sherhow checked the room inside and out, confirming there were no obvious surveillance devices which would be difficult to achieve with current technology and said in a deep voice, &quot;They&#x27;re flexing their muscles, but they are also demonstrating order. It is cooperation, but it is also deterrence.&quot; Lin Emo walked to the nautical chart on the wall, his gaze sweeping over the marked dragon soul controlled areas, known territories, dangerous sea areas, and several locations marked with special symbols that appeared to be ancient ruins. One of them near the northeast I see was marked with a red question mark. Since we&#x27;re here, let&#x27;s make the best of it. Lenmo turned to his two companions.</p>
<p>Take a break and recharge. The real negotiations will begin soon. Remember our goals. Equal cooperation, clear boundaries, and tangible benefits. Talk less, observe more, and listen more.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, shortly after a simple lunch, footsteps and a guard&#x27;s announcement came from outside the door. Captain Xiao Ji Gang has arrived. The door opened and Xiao Ji Gang dressed in military uniform, travel worn but still in high spirits stroed in with a hearty smile. Lord Lin Mo, brother Sherhao, Manager Chen, you must be tired from your journey. Base affairs have been busy, so I couldn&#x27;t greet you from afar.</p>
<p>Please forgive me. Captain Xiao is very busy with military affairs, so it is an honor for him to personally receive us. Lynn Mo stood up to greet him. After exchanging pleasantries and taking their seats, Xiao Ji Gang cut to the chase without further formalities. Regarding the IC incident, it was thanks to the strong support of the Mo Yuan Pavilion that we were able to thwart Caesar&#x27;s conspiracy in avert catastrophe.</p>
<p>The entire dragon soul will remember this. As for the cooperation framework mentioned in your previous letter, what are your thoughts, Lord Lynn Mo? Lynmo already prepared slowly began to speak. The Dragon Souls maintenance of order in the seas is a collective effort. The Mo Yuan Pavilion is willing to contribute. The draft framework is feasible in principle, but the details which are crucial to the foundation of long-term cooperation between the two sides still require careful consideration.</p>
<p>For example, the scope and timeliness of intelligence sharing, the definition of command authority for joint operations, the specific content and limitations of technical exchanges and post-war interests, especially the division of resources and sea areas left behind by the wings of freedom, all require clear regulations. His words were clear and calm. Yet, every sentence hit the nail on the head, expressing both a willingness to cooperate and an undisguised concern for his own interests. A hint of appreciation flashed in Xiao Ji Gangs eyes. He liked this straightforward negotiation style.</p>
<p>Lord Lyn Mo is a man of few words. In that case, let&#x27;s discuss this in detail. My dragon soul is sincere, but we must also be responsible for the thousands of compatriots under our command. I hope you understand. In the ensuing hours, within this simple stone chamber, negotiations that would profoundly impact the future landscape of this sea area officially commenced.</p>
<p>Sunlight streamed through the high windows, casting shadows on the rough stone floor. Witnessing the first cautious and pragmatic clash between emerging powers and those upholding order. Meanwhile, inside the rune tower on the island of Moyu, Leewi was deep in thought, staring a newly discovered metal fragment engraved with strange symbols. Such Chian, while organizing her perception records, suddenly noticed that among the previously dormant deep sea fluctuation data concerning the ancient existence on the seabed, there was a set of extremely weak energy decay curves that seem to exhibit a certain regularity of periodicity. Before the dust has settled over the ICC, new mysteries and undercurrents have quietly emerged.</p>
<p>Chapter 77. Agreement details. The negotiations inside the stone chamber lasted from the afternoon until evening. The embers in the fireplace were reit twice, and the hot tea brought by the servants was changed several times. The sunlight slowly shifted from one side of the high window to the other, eventually leaving only a dim yellowish afterglow.</p>
<p>The air was filled with a faint smell of tobacco. Xiao Ji Gang occasionally smoked a homemade pungent tobacco. the musty scent of parchment and an invisible tense sense of conflicting wills. The conversation between Lin Mo and Xiao Ji Gang gradually moved from the macrolevel principles and framework to specific detail clauses. Both men demonstrated exceptional patience and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Regarding intelligence sharing, Xiao Ji Gang pointed to the unfolded draft with a charcoal pencil. Our side proposes establishing a three- tiered intelligence system. The first tier is the strategic level involving major threats that could trigger regional instabilities such as Caesar&#x27;s actions targeting dangerous underwater locations, large-scale natural disaster warnings, or unusual movements by other large hostile forces which must be shared unconditionally within 12 hours of confirmation. The second tier is the tactical level involving specific military operations, resource point competition, and the movements of important figures which must be shared within 24 hours before the operation or after discovery. The third tier is the routine level, including marine weather, ocean currents, common marine mammal activity, and general power frictions, which will be summarized and exchanged periodically.</p>
<p>Lenmo pondered for a moment. The classification is reasonable. However, the premise of unconditional sharing of level one intelligence is that both sides must reach a consensus in advance on the assessment criteria for the authenticity and threat level of the intelligence so as to avoid misjudgment or deliberate exaggeration that could cause unnecessary tension. I suggest establishing a permanent liaison group composed of senior personnel from both sides to be responsible for the initial assessment and transmission of level one intelligence. Xiao Jigi Gang thought for a moment and nodded.</p>
<p>Okay. The liaison group&#x27;s location can be rotated between Pansure Island and your island every quarter. Personnel must undergo strict vetting. Agreed. Linmo continued regarding the joint operation command.</p>
<p>The draft mentions the Supreme Commander will be decided through consultation as needed which is too vague. I propose that the party initiating the operation be the primary commander with the other party providing troops and resources to support it and assigning a deputy commander to participate in decision-making. If the operation s objectives involve the core interests of both parties, a joint command will be established with commanders rotating among themselves. But major decisions require the unanimous agreement of both commanders. This is to ensure the independence and voice of the Mo Yuan pavilion in the joint operation and to prevent it from being completely controlled by the dragon soul.</p>
<p>Xiao Ji Gang gave Lin Mo a deep look and slowly said, &quot;Lord Lyno, your considerations are thorough. It is feasible in principle, but detailed rules need to be added. The main commanding party must submit a detailed action plan and risk assessment in advance. And the cooperating party has the right to raise objections and negotiate modifications within a certain scope. If the joint forces suffer serious losses that could have been avoided due to a major error by the commanding party, the other party has the right to terminate cooperation and reserve the right to pursue accountability.</p>
<p>That makes sense. Lynn Mo agreed. This is also a system of checks and balances. Regarding technical exchanges, Chindu interjected at the opportune moment, a shrewd businessman smile plastered on his face. We understand Dragon Souls concerns.</p>
<p>Core technologies do indeed need protection. The draft&#x27;s definition of non-core areas is too broad. I suggest we each first compile a list of technologies were willing to exchange and a list of needs and then conduct an initial match. For example, we are very interested in Dragon Soul&#x27;s expertise in reinforcing large building structures, improving basic smelting processes, and the detailed operation of the contribution point system. In return, Dragon Soul might have some insights we could exchange regarding the protection of small equipment in harsh environments, basic detection of energy anomalies, and the processing of some sea monster materials.</p>
<p>His words were perfectly watertight, indicating that his side had leverage in the exchange. Small equipment protection and energy detection were Leewi&#x27;s specialties and have been verified by the IC and also specifically asking for Dragon Souls infrastructure management and basic industrial technology all of which were urgently needed for the rapid development of Moan Pavilion. Xiao Ji Gang glanced at a civilian official beside him who was taking notes. The official nodded slightly indicating that he had noted the key points. Manager Chiians suggestion is excellent.</p>
<p>This matter can be handled by the specific technical personnel below who will draft the exchange projects and methods and then submit them to you and me for approval. However, it must be made clear that all exchange technologies must not be disseminated to any third party without permission. Of course, Chin Duo Duo replied with a smile. The most challenging issue is the distribution of postwar gains, especially the division of control over resource points and sea areas left behind after the collapse of the wings of freedom. Xiao Ji Gangs attitude was clear and firm.</p>
<p>Although Caesar was defeated, his controlled area is vast with numerous resource points and his remaining forces still exist. As a main force maintaining order in the region, Dragon Soul has the responsibility and ability to take over most of the area, wipe out the remaining enemies, restore order, and protect the innocent survivors. Of course, Emo Yuan Pavilion made great contributions in this battle and should receive appropriate compensation. He pushed forward a marked nautical chart. With the original iceclaw base as the boundary, the frigid waters to the east and north, extending to the broken ice zone are characterized by harsh environments, unknown risks, and considerable distance from your islands.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul is willing to take over and assume defense of these areas. As for the areas to the west and south, including some medium-sized resource islands formerly controlled by Wings of Freedom, two discovered small iron or veins and the patrol rights to the relatively safe shipping lanes leading to the northeast. Dragon Soul is willing to jointly manage these with Mo Yuan Pavilion or have your side take the lead with Dragon Soul providing necessary support. Specific management methods and profit sharing can be discussed further. Lyno looked at the C chart.</p>
<p>Xiao Ji Gangs division seemed generous, allocating the most dangerous and potentially dangerous northeastern ICC region to Dragon Soul while leaving the relatively safer and more resourcerich western and southern regions to Mo Yuan Pavilion. However, upon closer examination, while the northeastern region was dangerous, it was also most likely to hide clues related to the secrets of the deep sea. Dragon Souls takeover meant that the future exploration rights and information control of that sea area would primarily fall into their hands. The western and southern regions given to Mo Yuan Pavilion directly bordered their existing controlled areas, facilitating resource absorption and acquisition. However, this also meant that Mo Yuan Pavilion would directly face the most likely direction of a counterattack from the remnants of the Wings of Freedom, becoming Dragon Souls first line of defense against retaliation.</p>
<p>This was a brilliant move. It provided tangible benefits, shifted some of the risk, and ensured Dragon Souls control over the most critical unknown area. Lynn Emmo tapped his fingers lightly on the table, not immediately expressing his opinion. He needed to weigh the options. A direct refusal might affect the cooperative atmosphere while accepting everything might put him in a passive position in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Captain Xiao&#x27;s division of responsibilities is thorough,&quot; Lynn Emo said slowly. &quot;The situation in the Northeast Sea is complex, and it is indeed appropriate for Dragon Soul to take charge of the overall situation. In the West and South regions, Emo Yuan Pavilion can be responsible for the main defense and development. However, regarding the specific regulations for the joint management of the area, and if any special relics or information related to this incident are discovered in the Northeast Sea in the future, we hope to retain a certain right to know and a limited right to participate. After all, we have paid a price for this and also possess some unique information.</p>
<p>He emphasized unique information, implying that the Mo Yuan Pavilion was not entirely ignorant of the secrets of the seabed, nor had it completely abandoned its concern for that region. Xiao Ji Gangs gaze sharpened slightly. After a moment of eye contact with Linmo, he suddenly smiled and said, &quot;Lord Lyn Mo is indeed farsighted. Very well. The details of the joint management charter will be drafted by our subordinates.</p>
<p>As for the special discovery in the Northeast Sea, if it is indeed directly related to this incident and involves significant safety, Dragon Soul promises to promptly inform your side and where possible, invite your experts to participate in the assessment. However, the leading role and final decision-making authority must belong to Dragon Soul. This is necessary to maintain overall order, and we hope for your understanding. Understand? Then Montac nodded. Gaining the right to know and limited participation was the best outcome they could achieve at this stage.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t relinquish control and Dragon Souls bottom line was clear. The framework of the main terms was thus finalized with both sides making concessions while safeguarding their core interests. The following discussion covered some details such as communication frequencies, coded signals, joint exercise arrangements, and a preliminary plan to eliminate the remnants of the wings of freedom. It was decided that both sides intelligence networks would first locate the main gathering points of the remnants before discussing specific actions. By the time the final clause was verbally agreed upon, the sky outside was filled with stars.</p>
<p>More oil lamps were lit inside the stone room, their flickering flames illuminating the weary yet relaxed faces of the group. Xiao Jiang let out a long sigh and rubbed his temples. Lord Linimo, negotiating with you requires the utmost care. However, the result is satisfactory. I will have someone prepare the formal agreement overnight and please review it tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you have no objections, you can sign it. Thank you for your help, Captain Xiao. Lyn Mo also felt a wave of mental exhaustion, but the results of this intense battle were fulfilling. It has getting late and IV had a simple banquet prepared. It s not a gourmet meal, but it s all locally produced at the base.</p>
<p>It as just a small token of my appreciation and I hope ull do me the honor of attending that Xiao Gang stood up and invited him. Linmo did not refuse. A formal banquet was both a matter of etiquette and an opportunity to further observe and solidify the relationship. The banquet was held in a slightly larger hall of the guest house. The dishes were not lavish, but the portions were generous.</p>
<p>There was grilled fish, stewed meat, vegetable soup, and a kind of coarse bread baked with grains from the island. The wine was also homemade fruit wine with a low alcohol content. In addition to Xiao Ji Gang and Zhao Wuan, several important managers of Dragon Soul on Panter Island were also present. The atmosphere at the meeting was much more relaxed than during the negotiations, and the conversation mainly revolved around interesting anecdotes from the sea and the exchange of survival experiences. Lynmo didn&#x27;t talk much, but every time he spoke, he hit the nail on the head, demonstrating his considerable knowledge.</p>
<p>Sherhow chatted happily with several military officers from Dragon Soul, exchanging tips on dealing with different sea monsters. She duodo was in her element, quickly becoming familiar with the managers in charge of logistics and trade and whispering about the market prices of certain in- demand commodities. Midway through the banquet, Xiao Ji Gang suddenly put down his wine glass and said to Lynn Emmo seemingly casually, &quot;Oh, right. There&#x27;s something I almost forgot to tell you.&quot; While clearing the edge of the broken ice zone, we discovered the wreckage of the escape ship that may have carried Caesar. It was empty, but there were signs of a fierce struggle and a small amount of blood.</p>
<p>We traced the nearby tracks, pointing to a deeper part of the broken eye zone, but the environment there is extreme, and our reconnaissance team cannot go any further. He paused, lowering his voice. Furthermore, our outer monitoring points have discovered that members of the Stonemason Brotherhood have been frequently appearing near several known ancient ruins recently, seemingly searching for something. The location of one of these ruins is related to the direction in which Caesar&#x27;s escape trail disappeared. Linmo felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s fate remained a mystery, and the movements of the mysterious Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood became increasingly enigmatic. Were they searching for Caesar or were they eager to find another key after Caesar&#x27;s failed mission? Thank you for informing me, Captain Xiao. Lynn and Mo raised his glass in a gesture of respect. It seems that although the sea is temporarily at peace, the undercurrents are still strong. We need to work together more closely.</p>
<p>Exactly. Xiao Ji Gang raises glass in a toast for order and for survival. The glass is clinkedked lightly, producing a crisp sound. The details of the agreement have been finalized at the negotiating table, but the real test perhaps was only just beginning to surface amidst these new undercurrents. In the darkness of night, the island of Pansure is brightly lit like a lighthouse of order standing tall in a chaotic sea.</p>
<p>But beyond the lighouses glow in the deep darkness, unknown shadows still linger and lurk. Chapter 78. New affairs upon returning to the island. Yuan was returning from Pansure Island with a smooth journey. The sea shimmerred and the warm early summer sun dispelled the biting chill brought by the icy sea of the past few days.</p>
<p>The ship still bore obvious signs of battle damage, but it sailed smoothly. The route guided by the rune towers avoided all known turbulent areas, making the return journey exceptionally smooth. Lyno stood at top the ship&#x27;s deck, gazing back at the gradually shrinking outline of Rock Island. The negotiations had been remarkably successful. A relatively equal and clearly defined strategic cooperation agreement was about to be signed, officially granting Mo Yuan Pavilion the recognition and endorsement of Dragon Soul and defining its own sphere of influence and interests.</p>
<p>More importantly, through contact with Xiao Ji Gang and other members of Dragon Soul, he had gained a preliminary understanding of this behemoth style and bottomline pragmatic, orderly, and rule- abiding, but also absolutely committed to maintaining its dominant position. This laid the foundation for long-term interaction in the future. But the information Xiao Ji Gang revealed at the end left Lin Emo uneasy. Caesar might not be dead and his movements might have intersected with those of the mysterious Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood. The secrets of the deep sea were far from being revealed and new undercurrents were already stirring.</p>
<p>Boss, look at this. Shhal walked over, holding several newly compiled lists. This is Fatty Chin&#x27;s estimate of the manpower and resources needed to take over the resource islands and mines in the west and south regions in the initial stage, as well as the preliminary development plan. He suggested that we first transfer a group of experienced and combat capable veterans from the islands to establish outposts while recruiting some reliable newcomers to fill the gaps using experienced personnel to mentor new ones. In terms of defense, we need to deploy at least two modified sentry ships and a small squad of standing troops.</p>
<p>Lenmo took the list and glanced at it. Chinwood&#x27;s plan was very detailed, taking into account personnel rotation, material supply, construction of defensive fortifications, and initial development priorities, prioritizing iron or mining, followed by agricultural pilot projects on Arabal Islands. The investment was considerable, but the returns were substantial. Those resources would greatly alleviate the resource pressure brought about by the rapid development of Mo Yuan Pavilion, especially the stable supply of iron. Okay, when you get back, you and Shin Duo Duo will finalize the personnel selection and resource allocation.</p>
<p>The outpost personnel should be highly skilled with excellent compensation and clearly defined responsibilities. It has better to have stronger defensive forces. The remnants of the wings of Freedom 1T be content and may launch a counterattack, Lin Mo instructed. In addition, the boundary demarcation and communication mechanism for the shared management area with Dragon Soul should be finalized as soon as possible to avoid future friction. Understood.</p>
<p>Sherhow nodded in agreement. A few days later, the Mo Yuan slowly sailed into its own harbor. Although the scene of welcoming them at the dock was not as grand as when they returned last time, it was still very enthusiastic. The island had clearly changed again. In the outer defensive walls seem to have been raised and reinforced, and several new watchtowers have been built.</p>
<p>Near the inner fortress area, a larger stone and which structure with obvious workshop features had been topped out. In the distance, the cultivated fields were even greener than when they left. Su Chanchian and Leewi waited at the dock with a group of people. Su Chanchian looked much better while Lewi had dark circles under his eyes, but he was in high spirits. Welcome home.</p>
<p>Su Chian stepped forward and looked Lin Mo over carefully as if trying to make sure he was all right. Thank you for your hard work at home. Lynn Emo nodded to her, then looked at Leewi. Judging from your expression, you&#x27;ve made another discovery. Yes, a major discovery.</p>
<p>Leewi couldn&#x27;t wait and almost blurted it out on the dock. But Su Chanchian gently tugged at his sleeve, making him realize the inappropriate occasion. He lowered his voice and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s talk about it when we get back.&quot; The group returned to the inner fortress council hall. She and Duo Duo had already instructed people to prepare a simple welcome banquet, but everyone was clearly more concerned with business. After a quick meal, they gathered in the council hall.</p>
<p>Leeway immediately launched into a long explanation. Boss, the Caesar remains you brought back along with the pheromone samples and forced lane characteristic data combined with the deep scan record from the rune tower. I&#x27;ve done cross analysis and reverse engineering. He spread out several diagrams filled with complex symbols and connecting lines. It can be confirmed that at least part of the technological system Caesar possessed is highly similar to the ancient runic knowledge held by the stonemason brotherhood in terms of underlying energy guidance logic.</p>
<p>You could even say that Caesar&#x27;s technology is a simplified degraded version of that ancient knowledge but with a greater emphasis on immediate combat power and control and application branch. He pointed to a comparison diagram. Look here. This is a basic energy stability structure recorded in the Stonemason Brotherhood rune manual. This is an energy circuit analyzed from Caesar&#x27;s remains.</p>
<p>Although it is crude and rudimentary, the arrangement of the core nodes and the direction of energy flow are clearly some kind of variant of the former. And here the bioeny veins that are forcibly embedded in the pherommones. Their grafting method is similar to the forbidden technique of foreign object energy conduction recorded in ancient runes, but it is even more ruthless and reckless. Lynn Mo carefully examined the comparison diagrams. Although he couldn&#x27;t understand the specific technical details, Leeway&#x27;s conclusion was clear.</p>
<p>Behind Caesar, there was likely the Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood, or at least he had obtained key technical knowledge from the Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood and modified and applied it in his own way. Can you determine the specific relationship between Caesar and the Stonemaster&#x27;s Brotherhood? Is it cooperation, employment, or betrayal? Lynn Mo asked. Leeway shook his head. Tracing the origins of technology is possible, but judging interpersonal relationships is not. However, judging from Caesar&#x27;s final risk to activate the underwater existence and the Stonemason Brotherhood&#x27;s eagerness to act after his failure, their cooperation was probably not pleasant, where they each had their own ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Caesar may have wanted to use ancient knowledge to achieve his personal ambitions. While the Stonemason Brotherhood seemed more obsessed with knowledge and relics themselves, Xiao Ji Gang mentioned that members of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood were active in ruins near the direction Caesar escaped. Lynn Mo pondered. Are they looking for Caesar or for something Caesar might have taken or left behind? Or is the ruins themselves their target? Su Chian spoke up at this moment, her voice gentle but clear. I have also made some discoveries.</p>
<p>During the time you were away, while I was organizing the sensory data from the IC trip, I discovered that the deep energy fluctuations of that ancient being on the seabed, although they generally subsided after the judgment seemed to exhibit an extremely weak but regular periodic fluctuation in energy decay. She walked to a small black boar that had been prepared and drew a slowly descending curve with charcoal. as she marks several almost imperceptible roughly equally spaced tiny bumps on the curve. It s like the tides or breathing very slow with a cycle of about 15 to 20 days. This breathing fluctuation was not present in the data before the judgment or was masked by more intense fluctuations dot periodic fluctuations.</p>
<p>Lynmo&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. What did this mean? Did that ancient being after being stimulated and consumed enter a new state of recovery or adjustment? Or was it part of its own operating mechanism previously undetected due to deep slumber or forced energy interference by Caesar? Does this fluctuation have any special significance? Has the nature of the energy changed? Then Montress Suchian shook her head. The nature of the energy has not changed significantly. It still has that heavy ancient and inert feeling. The fluctuation is very small.</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t deliberately look for patterns, you can almost ignore it as background noise. The meaning is still unclear. But I think this may mean that the existence is not completely dead. It may have an extremely slow life rhythm or energy cycle that we cannot understand. Leewi&#x27;s eyes lit up and he leaned closer to the blackboard.</p>
<p>Periodicity. If we can confirm the period and phase, we might be able to predict its next relatively active or sensitive time window. This is crucial for any future operations we undertake near that sea area. Predicting the active period of ancient beings. This idea is both terrifying and holds immense strategic value.</p>
<p>Linmo also relayed Xiao Ji Gangs information about Caesar&#x27;s escape route and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s movements to everyone. A brief moment of contemplation fell over the room. More and more fragments of information were emerging. Ancient knowledge, misuse of technology, underwater secrets, mysterious organizations, periodic fluctuations, and a missing powerful enemy. Right now, there are a few things that need to be addressed immediately.</p>
<p>Lin Mo organized his thoughts and began. First, Leewi and Sue Chian continue research. Leeway focus on analyzing the technological homology. Try to find more connections between Caesar&#x27;s technology and the knowledge of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, especially any potential backdoors or loopholes. Shansen.</p>
<p>Continue monitoring and verifying that periodic fluctuation. If possible, try to build a preliminary predictive model, but be extremely careful and absolutely do not actively stimulate or attempt to delve deeper into its perception. Second, sure how and Chiendu Duo go all out to take over and develop the western and southern resource zones. This is the most tangible benefit at hand, and we must transform it into our strength as soon as possible. At the same time, coordinate with Dragon Soul on the details of joint management of the area and establish a stable communication and patrol mechanism as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third, the intelligence network needs to be strengthened. Chandu Duo use all channels to focus on collecting information in two areas. First, the exact movements and possible gathering places of the remnants of the wings of freedom. Second, any clues about the appearance, transactions or exploration activities of members of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, especially those related to ancient ruins. Dragon Soul will also share some intelligence, and we need to establish our own verification and supplementary channels.</p>
<p>Fourth, Lynn Mo&#x27;s gaze swept over everyone. The Mo Yuan needs to be thoroughly repaired and upgraded as soon as possible. Using the materials from the captured Caesar wreckage and new technologies, heavily way guide the workshop to strengthen the Mo Yuan&#x27;s defenses, propulsion, and especially its resistance to abnormal energy environments. At the same time, begin preparing the design and material reserves for the construction of a second main warship. Our naval power must keep pace with our status and the challenges we face.</p>
<p>The task was clear and specific, and everyone readily accepted the order. After the meeting, Lynn Emmo walked alone to the terrace of the inner fortress. The setting sun bathed the island in gold. Boats came and went at the dock. The workshops jingled, figures worked in the fields, and in the distance, the training ground echoed with synchronized slogans.</p>
<p>A scene brimming with life. The agreement with the Dragon Soul brought a relatively stable external environment and room for development. But the shadow of Caesar, the secrets of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, and the mysteries of the seabed are like hidden reefs beneath the surface, lurking not far away. Upon returning to the island, the primary task is to digest the spoils of war, consolidate the foundation, and enhance strength while keeping a close eye on the waves that may emerge from the deep sea or strike again. A new phase begins with the first step and the storm king&#x27;s fleet after rest and reinforcement will sail towards a wider sea.</p>
<p>A sea where opportunities and risks coexist. Chapter 79. Pioneering the dawn. Shh trudged through the due dampened grass. Surveying the resource point that had just been taken over by the mo yuan pavilion.</p>
<p>The island was small, long, and narrow with undulating terrain, but its northern mountains contained a small but highquality hematite vein. a priority development target on Shindwood&#x27;s list. The island&#x27;s original small mining camp belonging to the Wings of Freedom had long been abandoned during the defeat, leaving only a few crooked wooden huts and scattered mining tools. The advanced team sent by Mo Yuan Pavilion consisted of 30 people, 10 of whom were combat personnel led by an experienced veteran responsible for guard duty and the construction of defensive fortifications. The other 20 were carefully selected by sure how five craftsmen skilled in basic exploration and mining.</p>
<p>Five artisans proficient in construction and carpentry. Five diligent workers responsible for logistics and miscellaneous tasks. And five ordinary islanders who volunteered to earn contribution points in the new territory. Over the next few days, the camp was beginning to take shape. Abandoned wooden huts were reinforced and cleared, serving as temporary shelters and storage.</p>
<p>The base of the watchtower had been compacted and the superructure was being built. A simple path leading from the camp to the northern mining site had been cleared with several basic sentry posts set up along the way. For defense utilizing the terrain, a simple low wall was built around the camp using sharpened wooden stakes and stones with trip wires and bells placed at key locations. Team leader sure good morning veteran Wong Kuay who was in charge of the team joged over. He was nearly 40 years old with a scar on his face.</p>
<p>He was an early member of the Mo Yuan Pavilion, known for his bravery in battle and his calm demeanor. Everything was normal last night. The patrol team didn&#x27;t find anything unusual. It&#x27;s just that the bird song in the woods was a bit strange in the latter half of the night, so I had an extra shift of centuries added. Sure, how nodded.</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry. How&#x27;s the exploration at the mining site going? Old Shun the craftsman has taken his men to inspect it. Wong Kuay pointed to the north. The outcrop of the or vein is clearly visible. About two people high and a dozen steps wide sloping down into the mountain.</p>
<p>The ore has moderate hardness and a good iron content. The only problem is that we danty have enough mining tools. The few pickaxes and hammers left by Wings of Liberty R&amp;T enough. So, we need to send another badge from the island. Also, Old Shan said it would be best to get some gunpowder because in some places the rock is too hard and using manpower to break it down is too inefficient.</p>
<p>Leeway could produce black powder, but the output was limited, so priority should be given to supplying defense and repairing the MMO you want. Sure, how noted this down. I&#x27;ll coordinate the mining tools when I get back. Use what you have on hand to get the easier to mine section from the exposed areas, pile them up, and transport them away when the transport ships arrive. Be careful, especially with the supports and ventilation.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let it collapse. Clear? Sure. How? Then check the camp&#x27;s water source, a clear mountain spring, and food reserves. Enough for half a month&#x27;s worth of dry rations and cured meat, as well as some vegetable seeds brought from the island, which had already been sewn in a small patch. Conditions were harsh, but the team members were in high spirits.</p>
<p>New territory meant new opportunities and more contribution points and everyone was full of enthusiasm. Stone team there is a boat. It s our men shouted the sentry on the watchtower base. Looking over Sher House saw a familiar modified sentry boat the flying fish sailing around the reef at the southern tip of the island toward the small bay near the camp. Chi and Duo Duo was on board along with several unfamiliar faces.</p>
<p>As the boat docked, she and Duo Duo nimly jumped off, dusted off non-existent dust, and walked over with a beaming smile. Team leader, sure, you&#x27;ve worked hard. This place is quite well done. It looks very professional. Why did manager Chien come in person? Sure, how to greet him.</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re seeing someone off, you should also give him something. Chin Duo Duo pointed to the group of people following him off the ship. These are the professionals I recently recruited from the island. This is Master Jeang, who used to manage a small mine in the old world for a few years. This is Engineer Lee, who knows some basic blasting and rock mechanics.</p>
<p>And these are some skilled miners. They all have families and want to find a stable place to live. They have clean backgrounds, and I vetted them. He then pointed to the supplies being unloaded from the ship. This is the first batch of supplies.</p>
<p>In addition to food, there&#x27;s a batch of newly forged pickaxes, hammers, crowbars, and heihei, a small bucket of black powder that Kidly Weey managed to scrape together. Use it sparingly. Also, I brought some good stuff. Chando duo beckoned mysteriously, and two crew members carried a square object about half a person&#x27;s height covered with an oil cloth from the ship. Uncovering the oil cloth revealed a wooden device with a slightly rough but sturdy structure complete with a crank, gears, and belt drive.</p>
<p>Is this a crusher? Shhal looked at the machine somewhat uncertain. A simple or crusher? She and Duodo said proudly. I made it based on blueprints from the old world and had an experienced craftsman in the workshop figure it out. It can be manually cranked to initially crush large pieces of or saving a lot of effort. Although it s not as efficient as a machine, it has still better than just smashing it with a hammer.</p>
<p>I also got a few screens so I can sort the ore by size which will make it easier to transport and smelt in the next step. Dot. This is indeed a much needed and valuable item. Sure, how padded Chin do on the shoulder. Manager Chien is so thoughtful.</p>
<p>He doing business is all about maximizing resource utilization. Dot Chinwood as small eye sparkled. Oh, right. There is something else. I&#x27;ve even been in contact with deputy commanderho from dragon soul who s in charge of the jointly managed area.</p>
<p>The boundaries and patrol areas have been basically defined. They quite generous. They also allocated two small fishing grounds near our side in a bay that produces medicinal herbs for our daily use. However, they also made a small request. What request? They hope that while weary mining iron or we can keep an eye out for a special kind of dark blue stone with silver veins or related mineral samples in this area said in a low voice they say it s material needed for some kind of research and they were willing to exchange it for contribution points or other resources.</p>
<p>IV inquired a bit and it seems to be related to runic energy conduction dot a dark blue stone with silver veins. sure how noted it down. The dragon souls needs might reveal certain technological directions worthy of attention. After arranging for the new personnel and supplies to be stored, she duodo heardly boarded a boat and left for the next resource point to coordinate. Sherhow then convened a brief on-site meeting with Wong Kuay Lao Chun, the newly arrived Master Jeang, and others to readjust the division of labor and mining plan.</p>
<p>With new tools and manpower, efficiency could be significantly improved. After the meeting ended, Sher House stepped out of the makeshift command cabin and looked at the camp that was gradually becoming lively. The clanging and hammering sounds came from the direction of the mine where craftsmen were repairing their tools. At the edge of the camp, the families of the newly arrived miners were helping to tidy up the vegetable garden. On the watchtower, centuries vigilantly watch the sea and the jungle.</p>
<p>Pioneering is always accompanied by hardship and risk, but seeing this land gradually come back to life through my efforts fills me with a profound sense of accomplishment. It&#x27;s not just about acquiring resources, but about taking deeper route and building a more solid foundation in this chaotic sea. Meanwhile, on the vast main island of Mayuan Pavilion and the rocky island of Dragon Soul, similar expansion and development are quietly taking place on different levels and in different ways. The dawn illuminates the new territory and a path ahead that is full of challenges, but also full of hope. Chapter 82.</p>
<p>Hemlock mine news. The mornings on Heimmllock Island are awakened by the crisp chirping of birds and the tinkling of bells. At the mine site, the newly arrived makeshift crusher was already in place, and two strong miners were taking turns cranking the heavy wooden handle. The gears meshed with a creaking sound, and the belt drove the heavy breaker hammer, striking the hematite, or that had been loosened beforehand with a crowbar. Crush stones flew everywhere and quickly piled up below.</p>
<p>Old Shun wearing a homemade dust mask made of rot tan and thick cloth squatted nearby roughly separating the crushed or by size using a special sie. Effortless. It really saves effort. A minor panting and sweating profusely after finishing a round of cranking. Laughed before.</p>
<p>Smashing a piece like this would make my arms ache for ages. Now cranking this handle, although tiring, is much easier. Master Jeang, hands behind his back, squinted as he observed the Crusher&#x27;s operation, occasionally pointing out which gear needed lubrication with animal grease and which belt needed adjustment. He had previously managed small mines and was familiar with these rudimentary methods. This is just the first step.</p>
<p>Once production increases, we&#x27;ll have to find ways to improve it. If only we could utilize water flow or wind power. On this side of the camp, the watchtowwer had already been built to a height of two people with a sturdy frame. Wanka was leading several combat team members, applying a mud mixture of clay and straw to the tower to increase its windproof and heat insulating properties. Space had been reserved at the top for a crystal lamp and an alarm bell.</p>
<p>The low walls surrounding the camp had been raised another foot, and at several key corners, Shivot Freeze made of sharpened wooden stakes had been installed that could be quickly lowered. Everything was progressing smoothly. But Shirhow knew that beneath the surface of calm, hidden dangers still existed. The remnants of the wings of Liberty, like a wounded wolf pack, would never willingly give up this rich mine. Although Dragon Soul bore the brunt of the cleanup, it was hard to guarantee that no stragglers wouldn&#x27;t set their sights on this place.</p>
<p>Moreover, the island was densely forested besides the known paths. Who knew what else might be hidden here? Although the unusual bird calls Wong Kuay mentioned last night hadn&#x27;t reappeared, Sherhow still ordered an increase in the density of nighttime patrols in a number of centuries. That afternoon, Sherhow was inspecting a small, newly cultivated vegetable patch. The planted seeds had already sprouted tender shoots when a young team member responsible for guarding the area near the mine ran back, panting. Team leader, Shure, we&#x27;ve dug up something strange at the mining site.</p>
<p>sure how immediately put down the wooden stick in his hand. What is this? Is there something wrong with the ore? It&#x27;s not or it&#x27;s some broken bones and things that look like metal pieces embedded deep in a rock straighta the team member described. Old Chun said the bones didn&#x27;t look like those of wild animals. They were a bit strange. The metal pieces were heavily rusted, but they seemed to have patterns.</p>
<p>Bones and metal fragments. Sherhow frowned and immediately followed his team to the mining site. The excavation face of the or vein had advanced more than 2 m inward, and sure enough, some grayish white bone fragments were exposed on the freshly excavated rock wall. The bone fragments were thick and irregularly shaped. A little deeper nearby, a thin metal plate about the size of a palm, almost completely covered with reddish brown rust, was obliquely embedded in the rock, with a corroded texture faintly visible on its edges.</p>
<p>Old Chun and Master Jeang were squatting nearby, carefully cleaning the surrounding gravel with fine brushes and wooden sticks. Team leader, sure, look at this bone. Old Shun pointed to a larger fragment. The thickness and density, Dante, resembled those of a typical sea beast or an animal that might be found on the island. It looks more like the leg bone of a large land animal, but the shape I sent quite right.</p>
<p>Dot Sherhow took the bone fragment. It felt heavy in his hand, and the cross-section was rough, unlike any marine creature skeleton he had ever seen. As for the metal piece, it was so badly corroded that the patterns were difficult to discern, but it was undoubtedly an artificial artifact. This vein has been formed for who knows how many years. How could these things be buried inside? Master Jeang Aar, unless this place wasn&#x27;t a seabed or a mine a long time ago, but rather land.</p>
<p>This guest silenced them all for a moment. The world&#x27;s landscape was already bizarre, dotted with isolated islands, and the sea level seemed to have undergone tremendous changes. In the distant past, the location of Hemlock Island might indeed have been a corner of a continent. Keep digging. Be careful, and see if there&#x27;s anything else, sure, how ordered.</p>
<p>Store all non-eror items that you dig out separately and mark them clearly, especially that metal piece. Try to remove it intact, and don&#x27;t damage the texture. He had a vague feeling that this might not be a coincidence. The dragon soul had specifically mentioned searching for dark blue silver patterned stones and now what appeared to be ancient artifacts and unusual bones have been unearthed here. The history hidden in this sea area might be more complex than imagined.</p>
<p>A few days later, when the flying fish came again to deliver supplies and or Sherhow carefully packed this batch of non-or items and handed them along with his detailed discovery record to the person in charge on the ship, instructing him to personally deliver them to Lynn, Mo, and Leeway. A few days later, the iron or mining gradually got on track with a considerable amount of or being produced daily and piled up in a temporary storageard, waiting for ships to transport it back to the main island for smelting. The camp&#x27;s facilities also became more and more complete, and they even built a small bath house using surplus timber utilizing mountain spring water and sun-heed stones. However, on what seemed like an ordinary evening, an accident occurred. At that time, Sher was on the newly built watchtowwer, observing the sunset over the sea and the movements of the surrounding jungle.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a large flock of dark birds took flight in the sky above a dense forest about half a mile northwest of the mining site. They lingered for a long time, accompanied by several short, sharp cries that did not belong to any known bird species. Almost simultaneously, a hidden tripwire bell set up on the path leading from a mine to the dense forest rang urgently. &quot;Enemy attack, Wong Ka, who was under the tower, sprang up instantly and grabbed the spear leaning against the wall.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s not human,&quot; Sure House said in a deep voice. He raised his binoculars and looked into the dense forest.</p>
<p>The branches and leaves swayed, but he couldn&#x27;t he see any obvious human figures. It has something else. Everyone, retreat to camp and close the gates. Archers, move to the towers. Miners, stop work immediately.</p>
<p>Take your tools and retreat quickly. The order was swiftly relayed. The artisans and miners working at the mine, though bewildered, were immediately disciplined enough to drop their work, grab their pickaxes or hammers, and retreat rapidly along the cleared paths towards the camp. The combatants quickly took their positions. Archers climbing the watchtowers and firing platforms behind the low walls, intently aiming towards the dense forest.</p>
<p>Just as the last minor rushed into the camp, and the gate was quickly slammed shut, the trees at the edge of the dense forest began to shake violently. Immediately afterwards, three ferocious creatures, each the size of a calf, leaped out. They had rough, dark green skins, similar to lizards, but their heads were flatter, their mouths were filled with fine, interlocking teeth, their limbs were short, thick, and powerful, and their claws gleamed coldly. Most peculiar were the rows of jagged bone spur-like protrusions growing on their backs, the tips of which faintly glowed with a dark red light. It&#x27;s a spiky ridge lizard.</p>
<p>They usually only live in deeper forests or swamps, are very aggressive, have thick skin, and spines on their backs are poisonous. Wong Kuay recognized the creature. His expression grave. How they get here, and why are they appearing in groups? The three-headed spiny lizards stopped at the edge of the forest, their flatheads turning, their cold vertical pupils scanning the camp not far away. They seemed somewhat wary of the humans on the fence and watchtowwer and did not immediately rush over, but they did not leave either, instead anxiously pawing at the ground and emitting low, threatening roars.</p>
<p>Bows and arrows, aim for the eyes and soft areas of the abdomen. fire freely, sure how ordered. With a few swift whooshing sounds, several arrows shot towards the lizard beasts. But these creatures reacted extremely quickly, jerking their heads or turning their body sharply. Most of the arrows clattered off their thick skin or dorsal spikes, leaving only shallow white marks.</p>
<p>Only one arrow managed to strike the forl joint of a lizard beast, causing it to roar in pain and slow its movement slightly. Its physical defenses are incredibly strong. Sure. How&#x27;s heart sink? The weapons in the camp were mainly prepared to defend against human attacks. They were far less effective against such a tough-kinned beast.</p>
<p>Use fire. They&#x27;re afraid of fire. Quick, gather the torches together. Several team members quickly move the torches and oil canisters from the camp behind the low wall. However, before they could prepare, the three-headed lizard seemed enraged by the arrows, or perhaps sensing the human&#x27;s weakness.</p>
<p>It no longer hesitated, letting out a sharp screech, and charged towards the camp with all its might. It was incredibly fast. &quot;Fire! Stop them!&quot; Sure how roared, grabbing a heavy crossbow and aiming at the head of the leading lizard beast before pulling the trigger. The crossbow bolt pierced the air and struck the lizard beast squarely in the forehead, but the arrow head only penetrated halfway before being jammed by the hard skull. The lizard beast thrashed its head wildly in pain, but its speed only slowed for a moment before it continued charging.</p>
<p>The other two lizard beasts followed closely behind, less than 30 m from the fence. Inside the camp, everyone gripped their weapons tightly, their faces pale. The ferocity of these monsters had exceeded their expectations. Just at this critical moment, a muffled rumble like rocks rolling down suddenly came from the direction of the mining site. Immediately afterward, there was a loud crash as something heavy fell to the ground, followed by an extremely shrill scream from a lizard beast.</p>
<p>The three-headed lizard, which was about to charge, suddenly stopped and looked back at the mining site with surprise and uncertainty. Shh also looked over in astonishment. Dust billowed up at the mining site as if something had collapsed. And could that scream from earlier have been? Before they could figure it out, a series of even heavier and more unsettling footsteps came from the dense forest in the direction of the mine. It was as if some enormous creature was moving slowly, each step causing the ground to tremble slightly.</p>
<p>The three-headed spiny lizard seemed to have heard some extremely terrifying sound. It no longer cared about the camp in front of it, let out a terrified howl, turned around, and fled back into the depths of the dense forest it had come from without looking back. It tumbled and crawled away and disappeared in the blink of an eye. The crisis mysteriously disappeared. The camp was deathly silent, say for the heavy breathing of the group, the gradually settling dust from the distant mining site, and the lingering echoes of their heavy footsteps.</p>
<p>Sherhow and Wong Kuay exchanged a glance, both seeing the surprise and lingering fear in each other&#x27;s eyes. What exactly was unearthed beneath the mine, and what did it cause to cause a stir? The development of Hemlock Islands seemed to involve far more than just iron or mining. Night deepened, enveloping the camp and the suddenly mysterious and dangerous forest deep within the island. A new challenge in an unexpected way quietly arrived. Chapter 81.</p>
<p>Mysteries of the ancient mind. The dust kicked up by the fleeing thorny lizards had not yet completely settled, and the Hemlock Island camp remained deathly silent. Everyone gripped their weapons tightly, staring in shock toward the mining site where the dust was gradually clearing, leaving only a jumble of collapsed rocks and a bottomless, dark gap. The chilling, heavy footsteps had long since faded into the dense forest deep within the island. Sherhow was the first to react, he suppressed his shock and ordered sharply, &quot;Wong, take your men and strengthen the camp security.</p>
<p>Check all defenses. No one else is allowed to approach the mine without my order. Master Jeang, Old Chun, take a headcount and see if anyone is injured or missing. The order broke the tense atmosphere and everyone sprang into action. After a headcount, thankfully, everyone in the camp had been safely evacuated without injury.</p>
<p>However, the situation at the mine was unclear. There appeared to have been rockfalls and landslides during the final evacuation. It was unknown whether anyone was trapped, but all the miners and craftsmen had indeed returned to the camp. Team leader, sure, was that noise from a mine tunnel collapse. Wong Kuay leaned closer, his face still pale, and asked in a low voice, &quot;And what could make such a loud noise like that?&quot; I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Sure how shook his head, his gaze fixed on the dark collapsed opening. But it is definitely not an ordinary collapse. The lizard beast was scared away. He recalled the strange bone fragments and metal plates they had unearthed earlier and his ominous premonition grew stronger. Send men to guard the entrance to the mine, set up roadblocks and bells.</p>
<p>No one is allowed to approach without my permission. Also immediately send a message to the main island reporting the situation here and requesting support. In particular, we need leeway or someone knowledgeable to come and take a look. Dot. The message was urgently transmitted back to the main island via the flying fish.</p>
<p>At noon the following day, the main island of Mauuan Pavilion, the inner fortress research lab. Leeway was scratching his head, staring at a pile of ancient artifact fragments sent back from Hemlock Island. He cleaned, measured, and compared the peculiar bone fragments with various solutions and atlases, initially determining that they did not belong to any known large marine or terrestrial mammals. Their skeletal structure seemed closer to some long extinct enormous reptile, but there were subtle differences. As for the rusted metal plate, after careful rust removal using vinegar and a fine brush, the surface patterns gradually became clear and extremely intricate interlocking geometric pattern with what appeared to have been inlaid in the center, leaving a regular circular groove.</p>
<p>the craftsmanship and precision. Leeway carefully examined the cutting marks on the edges of the patterns with a magnifying glass. It doesn&#x27;t look like it was handmered, more like mold casting or even more precise machining. And the alloy composition, it can maintain its basic shape even after rusting like this. It&#x27;s very tough.</p>
<p>He was engrossed at his work when Lynmo walked in with an urgent report from Hemlock Island. Something&#x27;s happened on Hemlock Island, Lyno said succinctly, handing him Shure House&#x27;s report. Leeway quickly finished reading, his eyes widening in disbelief. A mind tunnel collapse? Mysterious footsteps scared away the spiny ridge lizard. This must be related to these things they dug out.</p>
<p>He pointed to the bone fragments and metal plates on the table. What team stone and the others dug out might just be the tip of the iceberg. There&#x27;s probably something much bigger buried beneath the vein, and that thing might have come back to life or been alerted by the noise of their mining. Then Montac found it. This extraordinary trouble in their newly established territory was hardly a good sign.</p>
<p>What do you think might be down there? Another ancient being? Not necessarily. Do we pushed up his glasses trying to analyze calmly? Judging from the age of the bones and metal plates, roughly based on the sedimentary rock layers and the degree of corrosion, they may be very, very old, but they may be different from the energy level existence of the Northeast I see. This is more likely to be physical remains and man-made objects. However, the fact that they could scare away the spiny lizard beasts means that there must be living creatures below or something that has awakened and become active that terrifies them. Dot.</p>
<p>Does Sue Chanchian know? Lynn Mo asked. I haven&#x27;t t told her yet, but she has been mainly focusing on the periodic data of seabed fluctuations lately. Leewi said, &quot;However, if what s beneath hemlock island really is related to ancient or energy, her perception might provide some clues.&quot; dot. Lynn Emmo pondered for a moment. Get ready.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re coming with me to Hemlock Island. Bring the necessary tools and protective equipment. Also, call Sue Chian if her health permits. We need to find out what&#x27;s down there, how dangerous it is, and whether it will affect mining. Understood.</p>
<p>Leeway immediately began packing his treasure chest. Upon learning of the situation, Sue Chanchian did not hesitate and indicated that she was no longer seriously ill and could accompany them. She also developed a strong interest in the artifacts unearthed on Hemlock Island, especially the aura that terrified the spiny lizard beasts, which might be similar to some residual energy she had sensed before. 2 days later, Lynn Mo Leewi and Su Chanchian along with a 10person elite guard team arrived at Ironwood Island aboard the Mo Yuan, which had undergone emergency repairs and was in top condition. The atmosphere at the camp remained tense.</p>
<p>Sher How welcomed the group into the command cabin, gave them a detailed account of what had happened, and led them to observe the mine&#x27;s collapse from a distance. It was an irregular black hole about 5 m in diameter with jagged edges. Looking down, it seemed bottomless, and a cool breeze blew up from the darkness, carrying a smell of earth and stone and a faint, indescribable, stale odor. We didn&#x27;t te dare get close after the incident. We just observed from a distance.</p>
<p>Sh house said the collapse didn&#x27;t te continue to widen and there were no more sounds coming from inside. The surrounding woods seemed to have fewer birds and animals. It was very quiet. Duck Such Chian stood at a safe distance, closing her eyes and concentrating instead of extending her senses to their fullest extent as she had in the icy sea. She gently enveloped that area with her consciousness like a thin veil.</p>
<p>A moment later she opened her eyes, her brows slightly furrowed. It has both empty and full down there that she described the contradictory feeling. Empty means there is no life force fluctuation, at least not within my perception range. Full means there a very strong sense of sedimentation down there like dust and rocks accumulated over countless years and a kind of cold rigid presence. It s not life but more like a massive object.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t t have the active energy of the icy sea, but it has a weight. The weight of history no living creatures. What about the footsteps? Could it be some kind of mechanical movement, or did that massive object shift during the collapse? Suchian wasn&#x27;t sure. My perception isn&#x27;t that clear about pure material stacks and static objects, but I&#x27;m certain there aren&#x27;t any creatures with strong life energy like the spiny ridge lizard below. This conclusion brought a slight sense of relief to everyone, but the mystery remained unsolved.</p>
<p>We have to go down and take a look. Leeway looked at the black hole, his eyes gleaming with the determination of a technician and a hint of adventurous excitement. If we don figure out what s down there, the mind can&#x27;t te continue and this islandet one t be safe. We need lighting, ropes, protective gear, and detection equipment. Dot.</p>
<p>Then mo pondered. The risks were unknown, but leaving it unattended would pose a greater threat. Hemlock Island was an important resource point and could not be easily abandoned. We can explore, but we must be fully prepared. Do Linmo finally decided how? Arrange for people to build a sturdy support and pulley system around the collapse and prepare long enough ropes and a basket.</p>
<p>Leeway, prepare your detection tools. Su Chian, you stay up there and keep sensing. immediately warn us if there are any abnormal energy changes. The escort team will split into two groups. One group will go down with Leewi and me and the other group will provide support from above.</p>
<p>Dot. Preparations took most of the day. A sturdy wooden tripod was firmly secured to the edge of the collapse and thick cables threaded through pulleys. Leeway modified several search lights, enhancing them with energy storing crystals and focusing runes, allowing the light to shine farther and brighter. He also brought along sonic detectors and improved small energy resonators.</p>
<p>The personnel descending were all dressed in thick leather armor and carried weapons and signal flares. As the sun set, everything was ready. Linmo Leeway Sherh How and two of the bravest and most meticulous guards stood in the gondola. The people above began to slowly release the ropes, and the gondola sank inch by inch into the dark abyss. The beam of the search light pierced the darkness, illuminating the uneven rock face.</p>
<p>The collapsed passage wasn&#x27;t vertical, but sloping downwards, surrounded by scattered rocks of varying sizes and hematite, a common mineral in veins. After descending about 20 m, the sloping passage seemed to end, revealing a relatively open space below. The basket gently touched the bottom. Five people stepped out of the gondola and onto the loose, grally ground. A search light swept across the area, revealing a vast ancient underground cavern over 10 m high.</p>
<p>Its walls marked with signs of human excavation. Its style rugged and ancient, a stark contrast to modern mining techniques. In the center of the cavern lay a massive, even larger pile of grayish white fossilized bones, strangely shaped and of the same origin as the fragments they had previously unearthed. Beside the bones lay scattered rusted metal fragments and even the outlines of intricately structured metal components half- buried underground or faintly discernable gears connecting rods and some kind of frame. This isn&#x27;t a mine.</p>
<p>Leeway&#x27;s voice was filled with shock and excitement. This is an ancient sight, or rather an ancient workplace or a tomb. His light lingered on a relatively intact rock wall at the far end of the cave. There, the outline of a doorway, clearly carved out of the earth, was about 3 meters high and 2 meters wide, but its interior was completely sealed off by collapsed boulders. Above the doorway, on the rock wall surface, a faded but still recognizable mural was outlined using some kind of corrosion resistant pigment or metal inlay.</p>
<p>In a mural, some blurry, seemingly heavily armored humanoid beings are operating enormous, strangely structured machines. One end of the machines is connected to the outline of a terrifying creature with massive bones and spikes crawling on the ground. The background of the painting features towering waves and capsized ships. Lynmo&#x27;s gaze was fixed on the mural. Did ancient humans or humanoid beings use machines to subdue or exploit those terrify creatures? And is the backdrop a maritime catastrophe? What exactly happened on Hemlock Island in ancient times? What lies buried here is likely far more than just an iron or vein.</p>
<p>Beneath the ancient mine lies a mysterious and potentially mind-blowing history. This history seems to have intricate connections to the world&#x27;s oceans, creatures, and even some lost technologies. Chapter 82, The Key to the Ancient Remains. The beam of the search light was fixed on the complete skeleton, and for a moment, only the suppressed breathing of a few people and the faint sound of water dripping on rocks in the distance could be heard in the underground cave. The skeleton lay silently among the rubble and rusted metal.</p>
<p>Even though it was mostly petrified, one could still sense its immense size and ferocity in life. The row of jagged bone spurs on its spine perfectly matched the outline of the subdued creature in the mural. But what was most striking was undoubtedly the dark metal device deeply embedded in the bone crease at the junction of its cervical vertebrae and the first vertebrae with only part of its complex interface visible. My god. Leewi&#x27;s voice trembled whether from excitement or fear and he subconsciously took a step forward only to be pulled back by Sherhow beside him.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be impulsive. Sherhow hissed his eyes scanning the surroundings wearily, especially the skeleton and the sealed stone door. Who knows if this thing has any other strange features? Lynmo gestured for everyone to keep their distance as he carefully examined the metal device. The exposed portion was covered with intricate patterns and grooves consistent with the style of a metal plate they had previously discovered, but clearly more refined. There were signs of breakage at the interface, as if it had been connected to something, but that connection was now gone.</p>
<p>Leeway, what can you see? Linmo asked. Leewi raised the energy resonator in his hand, adjusting the frequency and carefully pointing it towards the bones and the device. The resonator emitted a slight buzzing sound, and the pointer trembled slightly, but the amplitude was very small. There is no active energy reaction, very weak, almost negligible inert energy residue similar to the feeling of these metal fragments. The device itself seems to be completely dead.</p>
<p>But the way it fits into the bones, he squinted, trying to make out in the dim light. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it was put on later, but rather like it was forcibly implanted or connected to it from some angle while it was still alive. Implanted while the creature is alive to control it. The scene on the mural flashed through Lin Mo&#x27;s mind. Those blurry human figures operating machinery connected to this creature.</p>
<p>Such Chian&#x27;s voice came through the small bone communicator they carried, connected to the ground, tinged with tension. The weight and sedimentation below are still very strong with no new life or energy fluctuations. But near that skeleton, there&#x27;s a very faint residual pain and binding sensation in the air. So faint it&#x27;s almost an illusion. The lingering pain and constraints further confirmed Leeway suspicions.</p>
<p>Can you figure out exactly what this device is used for? Then press it. If it really is a control device, its technical principles may contain immense value, but also unknown risks. Leewi shook his head. Looking at the outside isn&#x27;t enough. We need to get closer to inspect it, and we might even need to dismantle part of it.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s too dangerous. We don&#x27;t know its structural stability, nor do we know if there are any residual defense mechanisms. Then Emmo pondered, &quot;In this environment, risking everything to dismantle an unknown ancient device was tanamount to gambling, but leaving it unattended meant the mystery would remain a persistent worry, and the mining plans for Hemlock Island would be indefinitely postponed.&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s start with the most basic recording and external mapping,&quot; Linmo decided. Leeway: Use your tools to record as many details, textures, and dimensions as possible of the exposed parts of the device without touching them. Sure.</p>
<p>How? Take some people to measure the size of this cave and record all visible artificial traces and the distribution of bones and metal debris. Watch your step and don&#x27;t touch any unidentified objects. He turned to the communicator. Chansen, what&#x27;s the situation up there? Everything is normal. There are no abnormalities.</p>
<p>Sue Chanchan replied, &quot;Do you need me to come down and help? My senses might be able to discern more subtle structural differences inside the device.&quot; Dot. Not for now. Let&#x27;s stay in touch. Lynn Emmo refused. The situation below was still unclear, and Such Chan had just recovered.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t let her take any risks. The group split up. Leeway, like a cautious cat, circled a relatively safe open area, carefully tracing the exposed patterns of the device from a distance using a special charcoal pencil and tracing paper. Simultaneously, he used an extended probe with a reflector to observe the devices interfaces and fit from different angles. Sure.</p>
<p>How along with two team members began pacing the cave area using ropes and simple measuring tools, marking the locations of larger bones and metal fragments on the ground with lime powder. Lynn and Mo himself held a flashlight, carefully studying the mural. As the light moved, more details emerged. The blurry human figures seemed to wear clothing with pipes and heavy padding, and their heads had round transparent masks. The machines they operated had complex linkages and gear structures.</p>
<p>Some pipes connected to the ground while others extended towards the subdued creatures. In the background of the marine disaster, besides giant waves and ships, there seemed to be some more twisted, indescribable, enormous shadows hidden in the depths of the waves. Is this depicting a war, an experiment, or a desperate struggle under some kind of disaster? Lynn Mo Leewii&#x27;s voice interrupted his thoughts filled with suppressed excitement. We&#x27;ve made a discovery. Look at this.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo and sure how gathered around. Leewi pointed to the center of a complex pattern on the rubbing paper here. This circular groove is almost exactly the same size and shape as the groove in the center of the metal plate I brought down from above. And these surrounding auxiliary patterns are also highly similar. He took out the rust removed metal plate and compared it under the spotlight.</p>
<p>Sure enough, although the patterns on the murals and installations were more three-dimensional and complex, the core circular groove and the surrounding geometric patterns were exactly the same. Could that metal plate be the key to this control device or a component of a larger system? Lease pakula. The people in the mural seemed to be holding something similar. Lenmo took the metal plate. It&#x27;s cold, heavy touch sending shivers down his spine.</p>
<p>If this truly was a key, how should it be used? Inserted into that groove, what would be the consequences? Would it activate the long dead control system or trigger something else entirely? Furthermore, Leeway pointed to the broken part of the device interface. Look at this break. It is very new, very new relative to all this dust. It doesn&#x27;t te look like a natural corrosion brake, but rather like it was torn off by some external force. And near the break, there are fine scratch marks that are different from the surrounding rusta.</p>
<p>Tore apart by external force. Lynn Emmo immediately recalled the chillingly heavy footsteps and the collapse earlier. Could something else have happened down there besides the sounds they heard? Had something broken free? This thought seemed to chill the air in the cave even further. &quot;Have you finished recording?&quot; Linmo asked. IV recorded almost everything that can be recorded externally.</p>
<p>Leeway nodded. The measurements are almost complete. The cave is roughly an irregular oval shape, about 40 m at its longest and 20 m at its widest. Apart from the collapsed entrance we came in through and the sealed stone door, we haven&#x27;t found any other obvious exits. The bones and large metal fragments are mainly concentrated in the center and near the stone door.</p>
<p>Sure. How reported. Okay. Do Linn Mo decisively ordered collect all the rubbings and measurements and take the metal plate. Weary leaving.</p>
<p>Remember, Dante, touch anything, especially the skeleton and the device dot. The group slowly retreated back to the gondola, checking once again to ensure no items were left behind or anything unusual. The ropes slowly rose, carrying them away from this underground space filled with ancient mysteries. Back on the ground, the afterglow of the setting sun made them feel a little dazed. Suchian came forward and looked at everyone with concern.</p>
<p>The situation is more complicated than we anticipated. Lynn Emmo briefly explained his findings. That metal plate might be the key. Leeway, when we get back, you and Shian should work together to study the plate and the rubbings and see if we can decipher its purpose and the information it might contain. Sure, how the mine is temporarily sealed off completely with double security measures in place.</p>
<p>No one is allowed to approach the collapse site without my order. The camp&#x27;s defenses cannot be relaxed. He looked at the dark hole and then at the heavy metal plate in his hand. While the iron ore on Hemlock Island is undoubtedly important, the unexpected discovery of ancient ruins and potential control technologies may be far more valuable than a mere vein. Behind this discovery lies a connection to the world&#x27;s lost history.</p>
<p>The knowledge sought by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and perhaps even the origins of an ancient being deep beneath the sea. An ancient key was unearthed by chance. Will opening it unleash opportunity or disaster? No one knows, but once the exploration begins, it&#x27;s hard to stop. Nightfalls, enveloping Hemlock Island and the ancient mystery that has only just begun to unfold. While consolidating its existing foundation, the gaze of Muan Pavilion is involuntarily drawn into the deeper mists of history.</p>
<p>Chapter 83. Cipher on the stone tablet. The Emo Yuan, carrying the secrets brought back from the depths of Hemlock Island, quietly returned to port. The setting sun dyed the sea a molten gold, and the stern left a long, fragmented trail of light. The usual clamor on the deck was gone.</p>
<p>A heavy silence, a mixture of discovery and bewilderment enveloped everyone. Lyn Mo stood on the bridge, his gaze fixed on the location of Hemlock Island on the nautical chart. But his thoughts drifted to the dark metal plate lying quietly in the internal compartments isolation box and a dazzlingly intricate ancient patterns that Lee Wei had copied. Mining on Hemlock Island had been forced to a halt, but the value of this unexpected discovery might far exceed that of the hematite. Suian leaned against the port hole, closing her eyes to rest.</p>
<p>While her senses were beneath Hemlock Island, she hadn&#x27;t encountered any danger, but she had clearly captured a kind of ancient, forcibly restrained pain and heavy sedimentation. This feeling was completely different from the ancient existence beneath the icy sea. It lacked that vast vitality and power, more like a tragedy and struggle buried and solidified by time. She vaguely felt that there might be some inexplicable connection between the two, like different fragments of the same enormous jigsaw puzzle. Leewi eyes locked himself in a makeshift workshop filled with instruments and drafts, studying the rubbings with near obsessive concentration under the soft glow of a crystal lamp.</p>
<p>He examined every turn of the patterns inch by inch with a magnifying glass. Measured the depth and angle of the grooves with a self-made ruler and sketched, calculated, and built possible models on scrap paper with a charcoal pencil. His apprentice was responsible for recording and passing on the data, barely daring to breathe. Look at these auxiliary patterns here. They read not just decorations.</p>
<p>They form a multi-layered nested energy guiding circuit. And this groove with its spiral pattern on the inner wall seems to be designed for some specific insertion and rotation action. Leewi muttered to himself, his eyes bloodshot yet unusually bright. The person operating the machinery in that mural is holding something similar. Inserting, rotating, starting or controlling it.</p>
<p>But where the energy source where the control signal? This board itself has no energy source. He tried to use the knowledge he had learned from the rune tower to analyze the patterns and found that some of the structural principles were the same. But the way they were expressed was more ancient, simpler, and even more efficient and essential. It was like seeing the earliest form of a complex mathematical formula. Rudimentary yet hitting the core.</p>
<p>It was late at night when they returned to the main island of Muan Pavilion. The island was brightly lit and well defended, but Linmo had no time to rest. He immediately summoned the core members for a brief briefing, emphasizing the sensitivity of the discovery underground on Hemlock Island and issuing strict confidentiality orders. Starting the next day, Leewi and Sue Chanchian moved into a newly opened, more secure ancient artifact analysis room on the bottom floor of the rune tower. This room was far from the core energy flow of the tower, avoiding mutual interference and facilitating the isolation of possible accidents.</p>
<p>The metal plate was carefully placed on a stone platform engraved with basic stabilizing runes. Leeway did not rashly attempt to activate it, but continued to test it using various non-cont methods, energy resonance scanning, microructure observation, material composition analysis using rudimentary methods such as acid etching and colorimemetry and repeatedly compared it with the rubbings of neural patterns and device patterns. Such Chanchian was responsible for the exploration at the perception level. She adjusted her mental energy to an extremely relaxed and peaceful state. Like the gentlest breeze slowly brushing across the surface of the metal plate, feeling the information carried by the material itself, the flames and pressure during casting, the contact with rocks, water vapor, and minerals over the long years, and the faint almost dissipated energy imprint that once flowed through its internal circuits.</p>
<p>Time slipped away quietly amidst focused research. 3 days later, one afternoon, when Leeway gently applied a speciallymade fine cotton thread soaked in different developing solutions to a specific location on the rubbing pattern, following a supposedly predicted energy flow path. An unexpected change occurred. The cotton threads soaked in the medicine produced extremely subtle but visible color changes when they came into contact with certain intersections of specific patterns. They changed from grayish white to light blue, dark red, or light gold.</p>
<p>Moreover, these color changes were not random, but rather followed the patterns, presenting a regular ripple-like gradient. Energy path imaging. It really works. Leeway&#x27;s hands were trembling with excitement. I just randomly came up with this potion formula based on the reaction characteristics of several energy conducting minerals in a rune tower to specific energies, and I never expected it to actually work.</p>
<p>Look, these colors represent different energy attributes or intensity changes. Blue might be stable basic energy. Red is a control or activation signal, and gold might be a higher level command or certification. He quickly recorded the path and intersection of each color change. Su Chanchian immediately focused her perception on those color change nodes as well.</p>
<p>This time, what she sensed was no longer a vague mark, but some more specific and structured residual information, like listening to an extremely distant, severely distorted ancient ballad that still retained a specific rhythm and tone. At the intersection of these golden nodes, &quot;Sue Chansen said with her eyes closed, her finger lightly pointing to several spots on rubbing paper. There are very very faint remnants of intention that they read not words more like fragments of preset functional instructions that one of them feels like connect/lock another like energy reading/verification and the most vague one seems to be mode switching or status query function commands leeways eyes lit up even more this confirms my conjecture this board is just a key it might be a portable control terminal with authentication and basic command functions Only after inserting it into that device slot and completing connection/locking and energy reading/verification can it issue subsequent mode switching commands to operate that ancient machine and control that giant beast. This deduction sent the hearts of everyone involved in the research racing. If true, then possessing this lab meant they might be able to decipher a lost ancient technological system capable of controlling powerful beings or similar entities.</p>
<p>Its value was immeasurable. But what kind of energy does energy reading/verification require? Linmo who had been listening quietly raised the crucial question. We don&#x27;t know what password it needs to verify and where is the energy source that powers it. The machines in the murals seem to have external energy pipes. Leeway&#x27;s excited expression subsided slightly.</p>
<p>This is indeed a difficult problem. The verification code may be hidden deeper in the patterns or it may require a specific energy key. As for the machinery on the energy mural, it may have a large external power supply device, but this portable terminal is likely designed to obtain its starting energy from the inserted device itself. or the terminal may have some kind of long-lasting micro energy that we cannot detect and that has been depleted. He pointed to the circular groove in the center of the stone slab.</p>
<p>I suspect that something was originally embedded here, whether it was decoration or the terminals battery or identity core, but it&#x27;s lost now. Then Mo pondered the door to technology had been opened with a sliver of light, but the threshold remained high. However, these discoveries alone were already a tremendous gain. Continue the research focusing on two directions. Lynn Mo instructed first try to decipher the specific meaning of these functional instruction patterns and the operational logic they may trigger even if it has just theoretical deduction.</p>
<p>Second analyze whether there is any hidden non-energy path information in the stone slab and rubbing patterns such as text or map symbols also indicated that she would continue to search for clues through sensory perception. 2 days later when Leewi tried to shine light on the stone slab surface with different angles and intensities and used wet sand to rub it very carefully in an attempt to remove the outermost oxide layer. An unexpected discovery was made. Under a certain angle of sidelight, some areas on the edge of a stone slab that originally appear to be worn or impurities revealed extremely subtle, shallowly engraved symbols. These symbols are completely different from the patterns being more abstract and concise arranged in a few short rows.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not a pattern, it&#x27;s writing, or rather it&#x27;s a kind of symbolic record. Leewi and Su Chian immediately focused all their attention on these newly discovered symbols. There were only about 30 symbols, but they were completely unfamiliar. Leewi tried to compare them with known runic symbols, old world script, and even a few suspected characters he had seen in the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s runic manual, but he couldn&#x27;t find a direct correspondence. But as Sue Chian carefully perceived these symbolic markings, she experienced a strange sense of familiarity.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t that she recognized the symbols themselves, but rather that their rhythm and structural intent shared an inherent similarity with the remnants of functional instructions she had previously perceived. It was like the relationship between the written characters and the passwords of the same language. These symbols may record information about the stone slab itself or the conditions or warnings for its use. Such Chian speculated. I try to simulate the resonance between the rhythm of the perceived instructional intent and the rhythm of the arrangement of these symbols.</p>
<p>She entered that focused state again, repeatedly simulating the intentional rhythms she had previously captured, such as connection/locking, energy reading/verification and mode switching and trying to project them onto those unknown symbols. This was an extremely mentally taxing attempt. Time passed slowly and Su Chians face turned pale again, cold sweat beating on her forehead. Just as Lewi was about to tell her to stop, her body trembled slightly and she opened her eyes, a look of disbelief and bewilderment in them. I think I sense what a few symbols roughly point to dot her voice was weak but clear.</p>
<p>This recurring symbol, like three wavy lines, gives me the feeling of being close to energy, source, or cord at this one, which looks a bit like a fork but has dots. feels like verification, confirmation, or permission dot. And this mountain-like symbol feels like it points to stability, foundation, or earth. She described it intermittently, unable to provide an accurate translation, only a vague understanding based on perceptual resonance. But this was already a breakthrough.</p>
<p>Leeway immediately recorded these vague understandings and their corresponding symbols and combined them with the energy paths of the stone slab patterns, the content of the murals and the environment of the underground cave and made crazy associations and logical deductions. Energy source verification permit earth foundation, he muttered himself, his fingers rapidly tracing patterns on the sketch. Could this be a prerequisite for using this stone slab to control the terminal? Does it require connection to a specific energy source? Verification and permitting and anchoring or securing it with earth or some kind of stable foundation. Lynn Mo listened to their discussion, gazing at the mysterious symbols and intricate patterns. An ancient stone slab like a silent messenger began to speak in fragments about the technology and rules of a lost civilization.</p>
<p>The knowledge hidden behind this may bring power, but it will inevitably come with corresponding responsibilities and risks. Is this what the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is seeking? And where will this stone slab they inadvertently obtained lead the incis pavilion? Research continues. Mysteries are being unraveled layer by layer. But more questions are emerging. Ancient ciphers are being slowly deciphered, and explorers of the new world are cautiously trying to understand and grasp this gift and warning from the depths of time.</p>
<p>Chapter 84. Rock message. The ancient stone slab brought back from Hemlock Island like a pebble thrown into a calm pond stirred up ripples of thought within the Mayuan pavilion while also attracting the attention of outsiders. Inside the analysis room at the bottom of the rune tower, the research reached a temporary bottleneck. Although Leewi and Sue Chanchian had successfully deciphered some of the ambiguous intuitive understanding of the symbols and speculated that the stone slab might serve as some kind of control terminal.</p>
<p>The more crucial questions of what the verification permission specifically referred to and how the energy source was connected remain shrouded in mystery. A thick stack of energy path models of the stone slabs patterns piled up on scrap paper. Yet they were still unable to verify them in reality. They dared not and lack the means to activate this unknown ancient artifact. Perhaps we need more context.</p>
<p>Leewi said to Lynn Mo, rubbing his throbbing temples, &quot;Having the stone slab and the rubbing alone is like having a key without a lock. Behind the sealed stone door underground on Hemlock Island or in other places depicted in the murals, there might be an operating manual or an energy source. But with our current strength, forcibly digging is too risky. And that stone door looks exceptionally sturdy. Dot.</p>
<p>Then Montac nodded. He understood Leewi&#x27;s urgency, but he was even more aware of the dangers of acting rashly. The Hemlock Island mine had been completely sealed off with only minimal guards remaining to ensure the underground cavern remained undisturbed. The immediate priority was to digest and absorb the existing discoveries, transforming them into practical knowledge or technological inspiration rather than rushing to open the next unknown. in Pandora&#x27;s box.</p>
<p>While they were focused on internal research, the external situation was quietly changing. The information she and Duo Duo has recently received from various trade channels and intelligence networks carries a hint of unusual activity after their initial collapse and chaos. The remnants of the Wings of Freedom seem to be regrouping in some remote sea areas. Although their scale is far smaller than before, their operations are more covert and secretive. Several small settlements that trade with the Mo Yuan Pavilion have reported spotting unidentified vessels spying on them.</p>
<p>The vessel type closely resembles the fast reconnaissance ships previously used by the Wings of Freedom. More noteworthy are the scattered pieces of information about the Stonemason Brotherhood. Members of this mysterious organization seem to have shown unusual interest in several recent ancient energy anomalies in the sea, including the collapse area of the Hemlock Island vein. Some caravans claimed to have encountered men in gray robes, claiming to be geologists on their way to the edge of the northern icebreak zone who offered high prices for various stones or metals with ancient patterns and inquired about recent abnormal earthquakes or energy fluctuations. After Chien Duo Duo sorted through these fragments of information, she presented them to Lin Mo.</p>
<p>The tree may wish to be still, but the wind will not cease. Chien Duodo&#x27;s side. Caesar s remnants are like rats in the gutter. Definitely up to no good. The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood is even more elusive.</p>
<p>What they were looking for is probably related to what we dug up. Boss, we need to be careful. Doth Lynn Mo reviewed the intelligence summary, his fingers lightly tapping the table. The remnants of the wings of Liberty&#x27;s counterattack was expected. It was only a matter of time, but the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s movements made him even more wary.</p>
<p>This organization&#x27;s goal seemed purely knowledge and relics, but their methods and bottom lines were unknown. Were they now targeting Hemlock Island because they had detected the energy fluctuations from the collapse mine? Or do they already have some knowledge of that area? Strengthen patrols and vigilance at all our resource points and routes, especially towards Hemlock Island. Send more sentries and reconnaissance ships. Lynn Mo instructed Chin Duo Duo. In addition, use our trading network to gather all information about the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood.</p>
<p>The more detail, the better, especially their modus operandi, member characteristics, and possible technical preferences. Be careful not to alert them. Understood. Chin Duo Duo accepted the order and left. A few days later, a formal encrypted communication from Dragon Souls Rock Island was delivered to Lin Mo through the secure channel agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p>The sender was Xiao Jig Gang. The letter was very official. First, it routinely reported on the current situation in the area jointly managed by both parties, as well as a summary of Dragon Souls monitoring of the latest movements of the remnants of Wings of Freedom, which largely matched the intelligence Chiand Duo had received. Then, Xiao Ji Gang, under the guise of a technical exchange framework between allies, made a consultation request. The letter stated that Dragon Souls research department had encountered difficulties in organizing and deciphering ancient symbols collected from various ruins.</p>
<p>They noted that Mo Yuan Pavilion might have come into contact with similar ancient artifacts or information in recent operations. The wording was euphemistic but clearly referring to the Hemlock Island incident. Dragon Soul sincerely hopes to conduct limited highlevel academic exchanges on the identification and meaning of certain specific ancient symbols without involving each other&#x27;s core secrets in order to jointly advance our understanding of this ancient world history. Several processed blurred rubbings of the symbols were attached to the letter. Lyno looked at the rubbings.</p>
<p>The symbols were abstract, clearly different from the symbol system on the Hemlock Island stone slabs, but the ancient non-modern feeling was consistent. The dragon soul had indeed noticed the anomaly on Hemlock Island, and they also possessed information on other ancient symbols. This consultation request was both a probe and a disguised invitation to exchange information. Leeway Such Chian, take a look at this. Lynn Emmo brought the letter and symbol imprint of the dragon soul to the analysis room.</p>
<p>Leewi and Su Chanchian carefully studied the symbols. Su Chanchian tried to perceive them, then shook her head. The styles are very different, and the rhythm they give me is completely different. It&#x27;s like different dialects or even different language systems. Lewi eyes focused more on the technical details, the carving tools, and the material of the carrier inferred from the texture of the rubbings are different.</p>
<p>These symbols of the dragon soul may have come from another site or a record from another era. However, he pointed to the fine wear marks on the edge of one of the symbols. This word doesn&#x27;t seem like natural weathering, but rather like traces of repeated touching or use. Could these symbols have been carved on some frequently used tool? Lynn emo ponder for a moment. Dragon souls proposal carried both risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>Sharing information about the Hemlock Island symbols might expose some of their discoveries, but could also yield crucial clues about other symbol systems in exchange for Dragon Soul and perhaps even indirectly reveal more information about the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. After all, as a large organization, Dragon Soul had a wider intelligence network and likely a deeper understanding of mysterious forces like the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. We can respond that Linmo made the decision. Select two or three relatively non-core hemlock island symbols that we have vaguely understood and implications from their interpretations along with our guesses about their implications. Emphasis on guesses and send them to Dragon Soul as material for academic discussion.</p>
<p>At the same time, ask them whether these symbols they provided are related to certain types of relics or the functions of artifacts they possess. Be careful with your wording. Keep it vague and exploratory and do not reveal the specific discovery location or the existence of the stone tablet. This was a cautious tentative exchange. It demonstrated sincerity and cooperation and a certain value while preserving core secrets.</p>
<p>The reply was drafted by Chin Dodu and reviewed by Lin Mo before being sent to Pancher Island via encrypted channels. A few days later, Dragon Souls reply arrived. Xiao Ji Gang expressed great interest and gratitude for the guesses provided by Mo Yuinga, believing they were very enlightening for their research. Dragon Souls response to Mo Yunga&#x27;s inquiry about the symbols was somewhat intriguing. They acknowledged that these symbols were similar to markings found in several small uninhabited ancient sites suspected of having ritual or special functions, often appearing near passage entrances, energy focal points, or operational interfaces.</p>
<p>However, they had not yet fully deciphered their specific functions. At the end of the letter, Xiao Ji Gang casually mentioned that their reconnaissance unit had recently discovered fresh traces of activity by members of the Stonemason Brotherhood somewhere in the Broken Ice Zone, seemingly related to a newly exposed ice fisher bearing similar symbols. Dragon Soul was assessing whether to conduct an exploration and welcomed any relevant insights or expressions of interest from Mo Yuan Pavilion. This was practically an open secret. Dragon Soul had learned of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s new movements, possibly related to new ruins bearing ancient symbols.</p>
<p>They were using this as leverage, seemingly inquiring whether Inc. Abyss Pavilion was interested in participating or whether they would share more information about the symbols in exchange for cooperation opportunity. Lynn Mo informed the core members of the contents of the reply. Is Dragon Soul trying to drag us down with them to touch that new ruin? Sure, how frowned. Are they not strong enough on their own? Or do they think the risk is too great and want to take someone else down with them? They might also be trying to probe our limits to see how much we know about these kinds of ruins and how determined we are.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo analyzed. Incidentally, if they do discover something, they can get a share of the profits from cooperative exploration and also monitor our actions. Such Chian, however, focus on another point. If the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is so concerned about new ruins with similar symbols, there might really be something important inside. Perhaps we can find clues to decipher the energy source or verification permit of our stone slab.</p>
<p>Leeway was even more excited. If I could see the original application environment of those symbols with my own eyes and compare them with the actual objects, it would be much better than studying them by rubbings. Maybe he would be able to break through the current bottleneck. Lynn and Mo listened to everyone&#x27;s opinions with a calm gaze. The olive branch extended by the dragon soul might conceal a hook, but the allure of the new ruins and their potential help in solving the mystery of the stone slab were undeniable.</p>
<p>We won&#x27;t give a direct answer for now. Lynn Mo finally said, &quot;Tell Xiao Ji Gang that our research on ancient symbols is still in its early stages, and we need time to digest the existing information. We are keeping a close eye on the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s new developments and possible new ruins, and we appreciate the sharing of intelligence. Specific cooperation intentions will require further evaluation by our side.&quot; He needed time. Time would allow Leewi and Sue Chian to extract more value from their existing discoveries.</p>
<p>Time would allow Mo Yuan Pavilion to further digest the new territory, repair the warships, and enhance its strength. And time would also be used for observation, observing the true intentions of the Dragon Soul, observing the actions of the remnants of the Wings of Freedom, and observing the next move of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. The message from Rock Island, like a faint lighthouse in the sea fog, pointed out a new direction, but also revealed the unknown course and possible storms ahead. The Mo Yuan Pavilion. This newly stabilized ship needs to make a careful decision whether to immediately turn and head towards that light in the fog or to first fortify itself, stockpile enough provisions, and then plan its voyage.</p>
<p>On a nautical chart, new coordinates appear and disappear, and the player&#x27;s move requires patience and calculation. Chapter 85, Undercurrens and Preparations. The Dragon Souls tentative invitation landed gently on the deep waters of the Ink Abyss Pavilion like a feather, creating ripples before the surface, gradually returned to calm at least on the surface. Lyn Mos reply was carefully worded, neither rejecting nor agreeing, leaving ample room and time for both sides. Xiao Ji Gang did not immediately pursue the matter as if the letter mentioning the new ruins in the ice shattering zone was merely a routine intelligence sharing among allies.</p>
<p>But beneath the surface, the undercurrents continue to surge. Shienduo intensified his intelligence gathering efforts, focusing particularly on three areas. signs of reorganization among the remnants of the Wings of Liberty, the patterns of activity among members of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, and any rumors about ancient symbols or abnormal ruins. Resources flowed from his hands like fine sand in exchange for fragmented information, which was then categorized and verified by his few clever subordinates. There are indeed a few former leaders of Caesar&#x27;s forces active on the Wings of Freedom side, mainly in the southwest coral reef area.</p>
<p>Chin Duodo reported to Lanim Mo. They seem to be gathering their scattered forces, but they are doing so cautiously and haven&#x27;t made any big moves. It&#x27;s more like they are preserving their strength and observing the situation. There are no signs of an immediate counterattack. As for the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, Chin Duo Duo flipped through the records in his hand.</p>
<p>Their whereabouts are even more elusive. Besides the ice shattering zone mentioned by Dragon Soul, caravans have also seen grey rogue men near the black rock Canyon in the north collecting a special fluorescent moss. It is said that this moss only grows in ancient rock crevices with special residual energy. In the small island settlements of the calm sea in the east, there have recently been several transactions involving high-priced purchases of non-naturally formed metal fragments. The buyer&#x27;s characteristics are vague, but they pay very quickly, which makes me suspect that they are also involved.</p>
<p>Lynn Emo listened, his fingers unconsciously tracing the nautical chard on the table. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s activities seemed extensive, their targets clearly pointing to various items related to ancient or anomalies. This focus was unsettling, yet also intriguing. How much did they actually know, and what were they searching for? Keep a close watch, especially around our sphere of influence. Be wary of any unfamiliar faces or unusual transactions, Lynn.</p>
<p>Mo instructed. Also, we can&#x27;t let our guard down. How sure how&#x27;s training going? Boss sure along with his guards and the newly recruited crew is conducting daily training exercises on the auxiliary island in several key shipping lanes. Shen Duo Duo grinned. The intensity of the training is enough to make my legs weak just watching it.</p>
<p>But the results are truly remarkable. Our patrol fleet is now much more coordinated and the vigilance of the lookout posts is significantly higher. Then Monted sure&#x27;s conscientiousness and responsibility made things much easier for him. Emo Yuan Pavilion followed an elite route. Its members weren&#x27;t numerous, but each one had to be highly skilled.</p>
<p>Having survived the great battle with the wings of freedom, the surviving veterans were the backbone while the newly recruited personnel needed time and real combat experience to hone their skills. So far, it seems sure how is doing a good job. In the following days, Linmo focused more on internal development and daily operations. The daily check-in system provide a stable supply of basic and rare resources which after a 100fold increase have become a stable and massive resource foundation of the Mo Yuon pavilion. Most of the basic resources are stored in the ever growing warehouse with some used for internal consumption and construction and the rest cautiously entering the market through the channels established by Chandu Duo in exchange for other necessary or scarce items.</p>
<p>The island&#x27;s expansion has slowed down for now. After reaching level five, the foundation stones and resources required for each upgrade are astronomical, and there&#x27;s no time to rush it. Linmo is focusing on optimizing the existing layout and improving facility efficiency. The ecological zone and fish farm under Sue Chian&#x27;s management are operating well. She even tried introducing some relatively docil shallow sea seedlings obtained through trade into specific areas, hoping to gradually enrich the ecology around her territory and in the long run perhaps form a more stable food chain and resource output.</p>
<p>This work requires patience and meticulousness which suits her personality perfectly. She also often exchanges ideas with Leewi, cross-referencing their biological observations with the vague understandings about environment or life involved in ancient symbolic studies. Although progress is slow, both of them enjoy it. Besides studying the stone slabs, Leeway also began systematically organizing the technical drawings and templates he had collected from various places, including those obtained through daily check-ins, those acquired from the trading market, and those sifted from the spoils of the Wings of Liberty. He attempted to categorize them, trace the development of technology, and even try some simple improvement experiments.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo supported him, providing him with some materials and a small workshop. That evening, Lynn Mo climbed alone to the lookout tower of the storm sailboat. The setting sun painted the sea a warm gold, and the outlines of the several auxiliary islands belonging to the Mo Yuan Pavilion were clearly visible in the distance, with wisps of smoke rising from their chimneys. On the main island nearby, the planned buildings were arranged in a neat and orderly fashion, and ships were unloading cargo at the dock area, creating a busy yet efficient scene. Compared to the bewilderment and helplessness he felt on that isolated 6 square meter island when he first arrived, it was now a thriving and prosperous enterprise.</p>
<p>However, Lin Mo felt little pride. He knew that the foundation of all this stemmed from two sources. the immense advantages of the daily check-in and boosting system and his unwavering caution and shrewdness. On the map of Dragon Soul, the remnants of Wings of Liberty and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, clear enemies and vague potential adversaries abound. The secrets hidden in the Hemlock Island slabs and the possible new ruins in the shattered ice zone like eerie lights flickering in the mist draw people closer, but may also harbor unknown dangers.</p>
<p>What are you looking at? Such Chanchians voice came from behind. She handed Lynn Emmo a cup of tea made with unique island plants which had a slightly fragrant aroma. Let&#x27;s take a look at our belongings. Limo took the teacup, took a sip, and found the temperature to be just right. I&#x27;m also thinking about what to do next.</p>
<p>Su Chian stood beside him, also gazing at the sea. Leeway has come up with a new idea today. He compared the symbols on our stone slab with the rubbings provided by the dragon soul and found that although the styles are very different, they seem to have some extremely abstract commonality in the representation of energy flow. He said that this might require a more fundamental symbolic language logic and if it can be deciphered, it might become the key to interpreting different relic symbols. Of course, this is just a very preliminary conjecture.</p>
<p>We need more samples, Linmo said. Yes. Nadiv. So about that new ruin that dragon soul mentioned. The temptation is great, but the risks are also great.</p>
<p>Line said bluntly. The dragon soul may not have good intentions. The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood has already set its sights on that place, making things even more complicated. With our current strength, we are more than capable of protecting ourselves and developing our own power. It&#x27;s too early for us to actively get involved in a struggle for unknown ruins.</p>
<p>Understand, Su Chanchian said softly. I just feel that if there really are clues inside, it would be a pity to miss them. Besides, if we keep passively waiting, won&#x27;t we miss the opportunity? Lynote turned to look at her. The afterglow of the setting sun casting a soft glow on her profile. It&#x27;s not about passively waiting.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about actively preparing, digesting what you have, strengthening yourself, and observing the external environment. When the time is right, or the risks are reduced to a manageable level, or the temptation is too great to refuse, you&#x27;ll naturally act without hesitation. He paused, then softened his tone. Just like what we&#x27;re doing now, studying the stone tablet, training our team, accumulating resources, and gathering intelligence sits all preparation. Don&#x27;t worry, what&#x27;s ours won&#x27;t be easily taken away by others, and we won&#x27;t force our way in out of curiosity about things we shouldn&#x27;t touch.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Su Chian smiled slightly, the restlessness in her heart caused by the unknown ruins quietly subsiding. Lynn Mo&#x27;s calmness and composure always put people at ease. Oh, right. She remembered something. The fish farm reported today that the newly cultivated algae in the northeast corner is growing exceptionally well, almost a third faster than I expected.</p>
<p>I checked the water quality and environmental parameters and didn&#x27;t te find any unusual changes. I was wondering if it could be that one of those small environmental stabilizer templates that you experimentally placed nearby, the ones you got from the sign-in program, has worked. Lyn Mo raised an eyebrow slightly. It was an auxiliary device made from a rare template, described vaguely, only saying that it could minorly optimize the local environment and promote natural growth. He had received a few when he signed in and then asked Sue Chian to choose a place to try setting them up, possibly continued to observe and record the data.</p>
<p>If the results are stable and repeatable, it will be very valuable, Lyno said. This was a small piece of good news for the day. As night fell, a cool sea breeze brought a sense of coolness. Lights gradually illuminated the various parts of Mayuan Pavilion like stars scattered across the sea. Lynmo and Sue Chanchand stepped down from the observation deck.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s reflections and conversations had clarified their future direction, continue to cultivate their skills, and accumulate strength for future breakthroughs. The undercurrents of the outside world and the distant glimmer of light both require a more powerful vessel and a wiser navigator to safely navigate them. And he and his Miuan pavilion are steadily moving forward on the path of becoming such a ship and people. Chapter 86. Rumors of shattered ice.</p>
<p>A few more days passed peacefully like the eb and flow of the ocean waves. The Mo Yuan pavilion operated smoothly like a finely wound up machine. Supplies in the warehouse steadily increased. The shouts on the training ground grew increasingly powerful and the output records of the fish farm and ecological zone were repeatedly broken with small but continuous increases. The algae area that was growing exceptionally well due to the environmental stabilizer after continuous monitoring by Sue Chanchian and Leewi had been basically confirmed to have a positive promoting effect.</p>
<p>Although the increase wasn&#x27;t exaggerated and the mechanism was unclear, it was undoubtedly an encouraging discovery, meaning that some special templates obtained through daily check-ins might possess potential value beyond what was described. Lynn Mo instructed Sue Chian to further expand the observation range, attempting to deploy several more stabilizers of the same type in different ecological areas and to record the data in detail. He had a vague feeling that these rare items, which leaned towards environmental optimization or rule assistance, might have long-term value no less than some powerful weapons or architectural blueprints, especially in this survival context that required long-term management and development. That afternoon, Chi and Duodu rushed to find Linmo, who was inspecting the repair progress of a damaged patrol boat at the dock. His face was somewhat solemn, but also mixed with excitement at discovering a new clue.</p>
<p>Boss, there&#x27;s new information about the ruins in the ice shattering zone. The sources are mixed, but I&#x27;ve cross- referenced several leads, and the credibility isn&#x27;t low. Chandu Duo lowered his voice and led Lin Mo to a relatively secluded storage area next to the dock. Tell me about it. Lynn and Mo patted the dust off his hands, gesturing for Chin Duo Duo to continue.</p>
<p>The news initially came from a small caravan that frequently traded snow salt in the north. They originally wanted to try their luck at the edge of the ice flow area to see if they could catch some rare subsurface fish. But before they even got close to their intended area, they encountered unusually strong ocean currents and turbulent ice flows and almost perished there. Chi and Doduo spoke quickly. After they escaped, they rested at the nearest supply point and mentioned this strange incident while drinking with the locals.</p>
<p>According to them, the movement of the ocean currents and ice flows was very unnatural. Not like something caused by ordinary weather changes, but rather like something large was moving on the seabed or something was erupting. Underwater eruption volcano. Lynn Mo frowned slightly. It doesn&#x27;t te seem like it.</p>
<p>There was tea a lot of heat, volcanic ash, or sulfur smell. It didn&#x27;t tea last long. When the caravan calmed down and looked back from a distance, the sea had slowly returned to a relatively calm state. However, the distribution of the ice flows clearly didn&#x27;t team match the nautical charts they had previously used. She and Duodo explained, &quot;The key point is that shortly after they encountered danger, another group of people claimed to have seen gray shadows nearby described as people from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and a speciallymade small boat that could maneuver nimly between ice flows.</p>
<p>They tried to approach the area, but they also seemed to be blocked by the turbulent ocean currents and ice flows.&quot; After lingering for a while, they left. Lynn Mo pondered, &quot;The Dragon Soul letter mentioned discovering fresh traces of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, which might refer to this. Could that newly exposed ice fisher be a result of this anomaly?&quot; &quot;Most likely,&quot; Chien Duodo nodded. Following this lead, I scattered some resources and bought some scattered information from a few middlemen who specialize in intelligence on the north. Putting it all together, around a few days before and after that caravan encountered danger, a section of ice on the western side of the ice flow, which was originally covered by a thick ice shelf, did indeed experience a localized ice collapse, revealing a bottomless fissure.</p>
<p>Some daring ice hunters saw it from afar and said that the ice walls at the edge of the fissure were dark in color, unlike ordinary ice, but rather seemed to have been mixed with a large amount of rock debris. Moreover, there seemed to be a faint unidentified reflection deep within the Fisher, unlike the reflection of Eista. Dragon Soul must know these things, too. Maybe even more clearly, Linmo said slowly. They chose to send us the message at that time, both to share information and to see how quickly and seriously we react to these kinds of anomalies and ruins.</p>
<p>Then we Chin Duodo looked at Linmo. Not Linmo waved his hand. Even the dragon soul itself didn&#x27;t rush in, which means that not only is the environment there treacherous, but there may also be dangers we don&#x27;t know about. The fact that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood tried to get close, but were blocked also proves this point. The situation is unclear now, and whoever makes the first move may be the first to fall into a trap.</p>
<p>He paused, then continued his analysis. However, this is indeed an opportunity. The anomaly has only recently occurred. The ruins are newly revealed and all sides are still observing and testing the waters. Dragon Soul has official backing, so its actions require more consideration and are more cautious.</p>
<p>Although the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is mysterious and focused, it seems they don&#x27;t have enough manpower to easily break through that naturally treacherous terrain. The remnants of the Wings of Liberty are currently licking their wounds and may not have the energy to attend to the north. We a calculating glint flashed in Lin Moe&#x27;s eyes. Now that we know, we can&#x27;t completely stand aside, but rushing in directly is definitely not an option. She and Doduo continue to use all reliable channels to gather as much information as possible about that ice flow area and that fissure.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to the usual sea conditions, ice conditions, and ocean current patterns. any signs before the anomaly occurs, whether there are other forces or lone powerful individuals active nearby. And most importantly, try to get a detailed nautical chart of that area, even if it costs a lot of money. Understood. Shin Duo Duo noted down the requirements.</p>
<p>I will get my spies in the north moving and increase the bounty. Remember, keep your actions discreet and use multiple channels to spread out your efforts. Don&#x27;t let anyone know that we&#x27;re doing our best to gather information. Lynn Mo instructed. Also, have Sherh How come over? Sherh How arrived quickly, his clothes still damp with sweat from training.</p>
<p>Chief, is there something you need? There might be a newly discovered ruin in the Northern I Zone. The environment is harsh, and there are unknown risks. Currently, both the Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood are keeping an eye on it, but neither has made any rash moves. Lynn Emmo briefly explained the situation. We need to make some preparations in advance.</p>
<p>Select a group of strong, coldresistant, mentally strong, and skilled swimmers and boatmen from the guard team and new recruits to form a reserve team. They don&#x27;t need to be able to fight in the extreme cold environment immediately, but they should begin targeted cold resistance training, and basic ice zone survival training. At the same time, check all the equipment suitable for cold environments in the warehouse, such as thick clothing, non-slip boots, ice breaking tools, and warm tents. Make a list and have Chin Duo Duo find ways to gradually make up for any deficiencies through trade. Don&#x27;t make bulk purchases that might attract attention.</p>
<p>Shhal listened attentively. A sharp professional glint in his eyes. Yes, chief. I will get to it immediately. Should we begin modifying the ships? Apart from your storm ship, none of our existing ships are well suited for prolonged operations in the ice flows.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#x27;t rush to make major modifications to the ships, but we can start collecting blueprints or templates for ships suitable for navigation in ice covered areas as well as technologies related to impact resistance reinforcement and antifreeze. Leti keep an eye on this as well. Lyno said at this stage we should focus on personnel selection and training and material reserves. We don&#x27;t necessarily have to compete immediately, but we must ensure that if we have the opportunity or if we have to go, our people will not be sacrificed in vain due to insufficient preparation. Understood.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished. Sure, how straightened his back, accepted the order, and left. This kind of meticulous preparation and foresight was typical of his style. After arranging these things, Lynn Emmo walked back to the main house in the center of the island alone. On the desk, there was still an analytical draft of Leewi&#x27;s latest submission on the comparison of energy paths of ancient symbols, next to which were ecological observation data recorded by Such Chian.</p>
<p>He sat down, his gaze fixed on the view outside the window. In the distance, the sea and sky merged into one, serene as ever. But beneath this tranquility, new waves were quietly brewing. The fissures in the ice cracked area were like a tiny scar that the world had deliberately torn open, revealing a corner of its ancient and unfamiliar texture. They drew in the greedy, the inquisitive, and the survivors to peer inside.</p>
<p>Emo Yuan Pavilion will not be the most reckless and greedy, but also cannot be an ignorant bystander. Lin Mo&#x27;s fingers tapped lightly on the table. All the accumulation of resources, intelligence, personnel, and technology was precisely to have more options in a more composed and confident approach when facing a situation where the unknown and opportunities coexist. This time, he chose to continue to lay low and secretly build up his strength. He sent the Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood to test the waters first.</p>
<p>He needed to see more clearly and calculate more thoroughly before deciding when and how to place his own pieces. A sea breeze drifted through the window, bringing a slightly salty scent. Linmo withdrew his gaze and returned to the blueprints and data on the table. Daily accumulation and research are equally important. True advantage often lies hidden in these seemingly mundane, persistent preparations.</p>
<p>Chapter 87, gained confirmation. Half a month slipped by in orderly preparation and waiting. Mo Yuan Pavilion like a lurking beast appeared calm on the surface but internally underwent meticulous and solid strengthening. Sherhow&#x27;s cold resistance reserve team had taken initial shape with about 20 strong men training daily in specific caves simulating low temperature and damp environments and on the frigid beaches at dawn. The training range from basic cold resistance sitting meditation to immersion in ice water and then to operating equipment and coordinating group tactics while wearing bulky clothing a monotonous and arduous process.</p>
<p>Sherhow personally led the team demanding high standards. In his words, the more you sweat now, the less you&#x27;ll bleed when you&#x27;re in the freezing cold and you might even survive. No one in the team complained. Those selected knew what it meant and they were all determined to succeed. Inside the warehouse, the list of supplies suitable for cold environments grew longer and longer.</p>
<p>Chanduodo was acquiring thick leather, ropes tanned from the sinnus of highly resilient sea animals, special anifreeze grease, and some insulating materials unique to the northern islands through several unrelated trade routes. These items were categorized and stored and treated for moisture protection. Leeway had also compiled several blueprints for partial reinforcement and simple antifreeze treatments for the ships. Although not advanced, they were practical and ship rights had already been arranged to try modifying them on several spare speedboats. Su Chian&#x27;s environmental stabilizer observations have made more significant progress.</p>
<p>In addition to the initial algae covered area, she placed two more stabilizers in a shellfish farming area on the other side of the fish farm and in a newly established small-scale coldresistant crop experimental field on the leeward side of the main island. Continuous data recording shows that the biological growth rate, health status, and crop germination and survival rate in these three areas are significantly better than the control area. The percentage difference fluctuates roughly between 15% and 35% varying depending on the species and environment. But the trend is clear. It has basically confirmed.</p>
<p>Sue Chanchian placed a thick stack of neatly organized records in front of Linmo. Her eyes shining with the brilliance of a researcher confirming their hypothesis. This kind of environmental stabilizer template can indeed produce a continuous and positive optimization effect on the biological growth environment within a local area. The mechanism is still unclear. It may regulate the humidity and temperature balance of the microclimate.</p>
<p>It may inhibit certain harmful microorganisms or it may even release some unknown substance that promotes growth. But the effect is real. Lynmo flipped through the records, each page densely filled with writing, data, handdrawn comparison diagrams of growth states, and simple records of environmental parameters, clear and meticulous, very detailed. This discovery is quite valuable. He put down the notebook.</p>
<p>If the effects are stable and can be maintained long-term, it means we can concentrate our use in key production areas, significantly improving the production efficiency of food and some raw materials. Furthermore, if suitable precious crops or aquaculture varieties are found in the future, this could provide a more stable cultivation environment. That is what I think too, Suchia nodded. However, the sample size is still too small and the observation period is too short. I would like to apply for a few more observation points, including a pure freshwater source and a relatively barren sandy area to see the extent and limits of a stabilizer s improvement on different basic environments.</p>
<p>In addition, we also need to test whether the optimization effect will deteriorate if the stabilizer is removed and at what rate. Okay, proceed according to your plan. Just list the resources you need. Lynn Mo approved readily. This technology which can improve basic output is worth investing resources in for in-depth research.</p>
<p>He also had several similar stabilizer templates on hand which would come in handy. Just as internal affairs were progressing steadily, news from the outside world also came intermittently. No further explosive rumors emerged regarding the fissure in the ice crack zone. It seemed that after that brief anomaly, the area was once again sealed off by the frigid cold and floating ice. Returning to its former danger and silence, Dragon Soul sent no further correspondence on the matter, as if the previous mentions were merely casual remarks.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s gray shadow was also never clearly cited in the relevant waters again. However, the movements of the remnants of the wings of freedom have shown some intriguing changes. Chandwood was spies planted in the southwestern coral reef area report that the previously sporadic groups of remnants seem to be slowly converging further west into a complex area known as Misty Bay. The waterways there are intricate, shrouded in dense fog year round, and the islands are concealed, making it a natural hiding place for troops. They&#x27;re retreating.</p>
<p>It seems they want to find an easy to defend stronghold to stabilize their position first. Chin Duo Duo analyzed Misty Bay is a place where even our ships can easily get lost, let alone carry out a large-scale cleanup. If they hide there, it will be difficult to clear them out in a short time. Lynn Mo gazed at the gray fog area on the nautical chart, specially marked as representing danger in the unknown, and pondered for a moment. Continue monitoring, ascertain their approximate size and key leaders.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t provoke them for now. Our current focus isn&#x27;t on them. As long as these remnants don&#x27;t actively provoke us, LinMo is happy to let them fend for themselves in the fog. Eradicating them would come at a price, and there are more pressing matters to attend to right now. On this day, Leeway excitedly found Linmo and Sue Chanchian holding a freshly drawn sketch with the ink still wet.</p>
<p>Chief Miss Sue, look at this. Leeway spread the sketch on the table on which were two parallel simplified and refined symbolic structures. The one on the left is a simplified version of the composite symbol representing energy gathering and stabilization extracted from the third section of our hemlockstone slab. The one on the right is an energy receiving substructure that I deduced from the symbols most likely to represent operation interface or control point among the rubbings provided by the dragon soul combined with other clues. He pointed to several winding strokes in the center of the two symbols.</p>
<p>Look here and the way they turn. Although their overall structures are very different and belong to different symbol systems, they use extremely similar winding and pausing strokes when expressing the concept of fine-tuning the state of energy flowing through a specific node. This similarity is likely not accidental, but rather stems from some older common technical language foundation. Sucham looked closely, tried to feel it with her sense of rhythm, and nodded slightly. Indeed, the one on the left gives me the feeling of gathering here and slowly calming down, while the one on the right is connecting here and adjusting to adapt.</p>
<p>The feel of that adjustment or calming down is very similar. Although Lin Mo couldn&#x27;t directly perceive that rhythm, he could understand its meaning based on Leewi&#x27;s diagrams and explanations. You mean different ancient civilizations might share some basic technical expressions or grammar? Very likely, Leewi said excitedly. If this conjecture is true, it means that we may not need to completely decipher an entire unfamiliar symbol system. As long as we can find more of these cross system common grammatical points, we can gradually understand the functional logic of different relics and devices like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>This is much easier than deciphering a completely new language from scratch. This is a very important idea, Lynn Mo affirmed. We need more samples to verify it. The symbols provided by Dragon Soul are too limited. Dot.</p>
<p>Yes, Leewa&#x27;s enthusiasm cooled slightly. If we could see the symbols of that new ruin in the broken ice area with our own eyes, especially their location and context, and compare them with the actual objects, we might be able to find more of these common points and even verify some of our conjectures about the connection to the energy source that his tone was filled with undisguised longing. Lynn Mo didn&#x27;t respond. He understood Leewi&#x27;s longing, but the time wasn&#x27;t right. He changed the subject.</p>
<p>Have you made any progress on the blueprints for the ships you mentioned earlier regarding navigation in the ice zone? Leeway came to his senses and shook his head with a hint of regret. We haven&#x27;t gotten anything related since we signed the contract. There are some scattered blueprints on the trading market for reinforcing the bow and adding ice breakers, but they are all minor modifications, templates, or complete blueprints for special vessels. They&#x27;re truly suitable for long-term navigation in ice covered areas are very rare. When they do appear, they&#x27;re quickly snapped up by major powers or caravans that specialize in trading with the north, and the prices are very high.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on it. There&#x27;s no rush, Linmo said. He knew that such things were rare and hard to come by. As evening fell, Lin Mo went alone to a newly built watchtower on the west side of the main island. The tower stood tall, offering a wide view.</p>
<p>To the east he saw the increasingly prosperous main island and its surrounding islands of Mo Yuan Pavilion, their lights just beginning to twinkle and the sounds of people faintly audible. To the west he saw the vast boundless deep blue sea where the sky met the sea and dusk was gradually falling. The secrets of the shattered ice zone, the lurking of the wings of freedom, the emerging and disappearing Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood and the dragon souls silent observation. And all these forces, like undercurrens beneath the surface of the sea, surge with their own intentions in the darkness. The ink abyss pavilion, situated within this complex web, can neither drift with the tide, nor remain aloof.</p>
<p>He gripped the cold wooden railing of the watchtower. The goals of accelerating development, accumulating strength, and solving the puzzle had never changed. Each step required patience and precise calculation. The cool sea breeze caressed his face, gradually calming his jumbled thoughts. At least for now, everything is moving in a positive direction.</p>
<p>The internal foundation is being strengthened and external information is being gathered. Just as Sue Chian confirmed the stabilizer&#x27;s gain. Leeway found a new approach to symbolic research. These are all tangible advancements. All he needed to do was maintain this rhythm, making the ship stronger and the navigation chart clearer before the real storm arrived.</p>
<p>As for that distant creasse, it would always be there. He would go there when the time was right. But now is not the time. Night fell completely, the starlight mingling with the lights on the island. Linmo turned and stepped down from the watchtowwer, his figure disappearing into the peaceful night of Mo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>Chapter 88. Omens of Imbalance. Time slips away like sand through fingers quietly passing by in the daily training, research, observation, and trading. On the island of Mayu Pavilion, autumn deepens, and the sea breeze grows a bit more biting, but the internal workings operate as steadily and continuously as a furnace radiating heat. The training of the cold weather reserve team has yielded results.</p>
<p>The team members faces roughened and reened by the sea breeze and simulated low temperatures showed increasing determination in their eyes and their movements though heavy with clothing appeared much more coordinated. Sherhow even organized a 2-day mini training exercise venturing into a relatively cold area north of the main island where sea ice was beginning to appear aboard a partially reinforced vessel for climatization navigation and short duration landing training. The process was uneventful, but revealed some minor issues with equipment and coordination, all of which were recorded and will serve as a basis for future improvements. Such an expanded observation experiment with the environmental stabilizer proceeded as planned. The newly established freshwater observation point showed a slight improvement in the clarity and sedimentation rate of the water affected by the stabilizer.</p>
<p>The long-term effects remain to be observed. The changes in the barren sandy land were relatively more noticeable. Although far from becoming fertile soil, the soil compaction had decreased and the germination rate and early growth of several pioneer plants tolerant of poor soil which were tried to be planted were significantly better than in the control area. These positive data points were encouraging for both Sue Chanchan and Leeway, indicating that this technology had broad applicability potential. Aside from assisting Sue Chanchian, Leeway devoted most of his energy to symbolic research.</p>
<p>His conjecture of cross-system common grammar points was like a new key. Although it hadn&#x27;t yet unlocked any complete doors, it gave him a completely new perspective on those ancient patterns. He disassembled and categorized all the symbols in the known areas of the Hemlock Island slabs, attempting to recombine and understand them using this approach. He then compared these symbols with the limited set of symbols provided by the dragon soul in greater depth discovering several possible common points mainly concentrated in the abstract expressions of state indicators such as activation hibernation and overload and safety boundaries. On this day, Leeway carrying new discoveries and a hint of unease found Lynn Mo.</p>
<p>He spread out several sheets of paper filled with symbolic diagrams and analytical notes. Chief, there is something I feel I need to report, though it might just be my overthinking dotly ways tone was somewhat hesitant when I was trying to use the common grammar approach to reverse engineer the possible functional logic of the undeciphered areas of the Hemlock Island slate, especially the clusters of symbols related to energy source and verification license. I discovered a somewhat unsettling pattern. Tell me about it. Lynamo put down a list of supplies he was looking at.</p>
<p>Look here. Leewei pointed to the center of a complex relational diagram. Let us assume these symbols represent the connection state or stability of the energy source. Based on the symbolic elements we deciphered that represent stability and balance as well as the common expression in the dragon soul symbols that seems to represent safety thresholds. IV tried to construct several possible logical models of stability indicators.</p>
<p>Regardless of the model, when pointing to that most complex area in the core of the stone slab that we can&#x27;t he understand at all, they all show a common trend. The system or state represented by those symbols seems to be on an extremely subtle, even critical edge with its preset balance parameters or safety boundaries. Leeway licked his slightly dry lips. It&#x27;s as if what&#x27;s recorded on that stone slab is the operating interface of something that&#x27;s already in a state of imbalance or high pressure. Verification permission might not just be for gaining control, but more like a complex security unlocking procedure to prevent this system on the verge of imbalance from being triggered incorrectly and causing uncontrollable consequences.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo frowned slightly. You mean the things associated with the hemlock island slabs might be inherently unstable or even dangerous. I am just deriving one possibility based on symbolic logic, Leeway quickly explained. Without physical comparison, all of this is just theoretical. It is also possible that my model is wrong or that those symbols Dante represent what I am thinking at all.</p>
<p>But he paused, combining the sudden appearance of that new fisher in the ice flow area with the reported abnormal ocean currents and ice flow movements. I can&#x27;t he help but wonder if there is some kind of connection between the two. Are they both some kind of deeply buried ancient system whose instability is increasing for some reason such as the erosion of time or changes in the external environment and which occasionally leaks out some abnormal phenomena? This conjecture was somewhat bold, even alarming. Lynmo remained silent for a moment, not immediately dismissing it. In this unfamiliar world, any reasonable speculation based on existing clues was worthy of caution.</p>
<p>I understand your concerns. Let us record this line of thought for reference, Linmo said slowly. But Dante spread it before we have more empirical evidence so as not to cause unnecessary panic. Continue the research on the stone tablet, but focus on the parts we can understand and how to use the common grammar approach to decipher more practical information. As for whether the system it is associated with is dangerous, we will not touch it.</p>
<p>It appears to be stagnant for now. Dot. Leewi breathed a sigh of relief and nodded. I understand. I will be more careful.</p>
<p>After Leewi left, Linmo walked to the window and looked north. Different locations and ruins on Hemlock Island in the shattered ice zone all seemed to point to a deeply buried, unknown past of this world. Leeway&#x27;s speculation might not be correct, but it felt like a tiny thorn pricking his heart. If these ruins were indeed connected to something unstable or even dangerous, then rashly exploring them, especially attempting to activate something, might be riskier than anticipated. A few days later, Chin Duo Duo brought new news, not from the north, but from the southwest.</p>
<p>Their s movement over at Misty Bay. Chandw expression was somewhat serious. One of our informants ventured close to the outer edge of the bay and discovered that the activity of the remnants of the wings of freedom s ships is increasing and it doesn&#x27;t tease seem to be random. They appear to be gathering and transporting supplies to a specific location deep within the bay a considerable amount of timber stone and metal ingots. Judging from their actions, it doesn&#x27;t te seem like a temporary camp but rather like they are building a proper stronghold or rather a fortress.</p>
<p>Can you determine who is in charge? Lynn Emmo asked. Several well-known leaders who were formerly under Caesar have been confirmed to have appeared, but none of them seem to have gained complete trust. However, they seem to have reached some kind of tacid agreement to work together to build up their base first. Also, Chi and Du Duo lowered his voice. Our informants reported seeing one or two speedboats with a very distinctive design entering and leaving the bay.</p>
<p>They are not the type of boats commonly seen by the Wings of Freedom. They&#x27;re extremely fast and move around mysteriously. We suspect they may be related to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Dot. Lynn Mo&#x27;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. They&#x27;ve gotten mixed up with the remnants of the Wings of Liberty. Is it a collaboration, a chance encounter, or a transaction? Chin Duo Duo analyzed. The remnants of the Wings of Freedom may possess some artifacts or information obtained from their previous looting that they themselves don&#x27;t need, but that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is interested in. In chaotic times, anything can happen.</p>
<p>This is a new situation. If the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood has indeed made contact with the remnants of the Wings of Liberty, even if it&#x27;s just a temporary exchange of interests, it will complicate the situation in the Southwest. One is an organized group of knowledge seekers, possibly carrying dangerous technology, and the other is a hungry pack of wolves that has lost its alpha, but still has its fangs. It&#x27;s hard to predict what kind of chemical reaction will occur when the two come together. Continue to monitor, but Dante, get too close.</p>
<p>Safety first, Lin Mo instructed. Focus on figuring out what they rebuilding, how large it is, and whether the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood s ships are actually in regular contact with them. Dot. Clear news kept pouring in as if the undercurrents beneath the calm surface of the sea were accelerating. The ruins in the north might be linked to unknown risks.</p>
<p>While the remnants of the enemy in the southwest might be building a new nest and attracting a mysterious third party, although the Mo Yuan pavilion itself was developing steadily. The external environment seemed to be quietly becoming more oppressive. As evening fell, Linmo climbed the watchtower again. The sea breeze was strong, making his robes flutter. He gazed into the distance, trying to mentally sketch a complete picture of the situation, combining the chill of the north with the mist of the southwest.</p>
<p>Leewi&#x27;s speculation about imbalance and Shiindu&#x27;s report about contact were like two pieces of a puzzle, not yet perfectly fitting together, but both pointing to some kind of change brewing. He recalled his longheld strategy to develop stealthily and accumulate strength for a later burst. The accumulation continues and his strength continues to grow, but signs of external change are emerging. Should he continue to focus on development and wait for clearer signals, or should he make some more proactive arrangements in advance? The last rays of dawn sank below the horizon, and stars gradually lit up the deep blue sky. Lyn Mo took a deep breath of the salty, chilly air, and a plan began to form in his mind.</p>
<p>Development cannot stop. That&#x27;s fundamental. But perhaps the outward tentacles need to reach further and become more sensitive. We can&#x27;t wait until the storm rages before adjusting the sails. He needs to know more.</p>
<p>The true situation in the shattered eye zone, what exactly the wings of Liberty and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood are doing and Dragon Souls next move. As he turned and walked down the watchtowwer, his steps were steady and firm. The omens had appeared. Therefore, caution and preparation were even more crucial. The ship that was Muan Pavilion needed not only to be sturdy, but also to be able to sense the winds of change in advance.</p>
<p>Chapter 89 decision-making trade-offs. Leewwayi&#x27;s speculation about imbalance was like a pebble thrown into a still lake. Although the ripples were not intense, they continued to spread, subtly changing Lin Moe&#x27;s perspective on many things. He showed no sign of panic, and his daily instructions remained clear and steady. resource allocation, personnel training, and production research proceeded smoothly.</p>
<p>But in his private life, he spent significantly more time reviewing records, studying nautical charts, and engaging in solitary reflection. On this day, he summoned Shao, Chin, Duo, Duo, Su Chian, and Leeway to the meeting room next to the main house. This room was relatively private and the latest maritime situation map was hanging on a wall with known spheres of influence, resource points, danger zones, and recent events of concern marked with different colors and symbols. I called everyone here to take a look at the current situation and hear your thoughts. Lyno got straight to the point, pointing to the sea chart.</p>
<p>To the north, there&#x27;s a new rift in the shattered eye zone. The situation is unclear. Both the Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood are keeping an eye on it, and Leeway speculates it might be related to some unstable factor. To the southwest, the remnants of the Wings of Freedom seem to have built a nest in Misty Bay and may have had contact with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. As for our Mo Yuan Pavilion itself, &quot;We are in a period of development, and all our affairs are just getting on track.&quot; He paused, his gaze sweeping over the four of them.</p>
<p>The waters outside are getting murky with more undercurrents. Should we continue to stay inside, focusing solely on development until we&#x27;re strong enough to overwhelm the competition before venturing out, or do we need to adjust our strategy and proactively respond to these changes? Sher House spoke first, his voice steady and powerful. Chief, my opinion is that with limited resources, a rash attack would be suicide. The remnants of the wings of freedom have built their nest. As long as they don&#x27;t actively raid our flight paths, we can ignore them for now.</p>
<p>The Shattered Eye Zone is even more dangerous and unknown. Dragon&#x27;s Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood are stronger than us, and they dare not act rashly. So why should we wade into troubled waters? The most urgent task is to train our troops to be more elite, defend the islands more securely, and stockpile more supplies. With a strong fist, our words will carry weight, and we will have the confidence to venture out. His words represented the safest approach and the consistent principle upheld by the Mayuan pavilion.</p>
<p>Chiian Duo Duo continued, &quot;Boss sure is right. The foundation cannot be shaken. However, businessmen need a keen sense of smell. When the waters outside become murky, it often means more opportunities. The remnants of the Wings of Freedom need a lot of resources to build their nest, and they must have a lot of good stuff they looted before.</p>
<p>Now they&#x27;re eager to exchange it for building materials and food, which is a good opportunity to buy at rock bottom prices. Maybe we can find some treasures. The icebreaker zone is dangerous, but it attracts a lot of attention, and there are many rumors and demands. We can stay put, but we can&#x27;t ignore the information. What I mean is development should be stable, but we need to be even more attentive to what&#x27;s going on outside and what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#x27;t participate, but we should be aware of the situation, and we can even subtly guide the direction of the tide. His eyes gleamed with shrewdness, as he added. For example, if the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is indeed trading with the remnants of the Wings of Liberty, what they took and what they left behind, that information itself is valuable. Another example is information about the Shattered Ice Zone. We can selectively leak some trivial but intriguing details to specific channels to see how everyone reacts, which can also muddy the waters and make it easier for us to observe.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian pondered for a moment and said softly, &quot;From a research perspective, both the Hemlock Island slab and other possible relics contain important information about this world, completely isolating ourselves might cause us to miss crucial clues to understanding the nature of this world, which may not be a good thing in the long run.&quot; Leeway&#x27;s speculation, while unsettling, also points in the right direction. Perhaps we can adopt a compromise. Avoid large-scale risky explorations but support smallcale highly cautious scientific reconnaissance. For example, could we design a remote unmanned or minimally human observation method to collect environmental data outside the ice flow area or try to establish very limited information exchange with some reputable small teams focused on academic research? Upon hearing this, Leewi&#x27;s eyes lit up, but he didn&#x27;t speak immediately and instead looked at Lynmo. Lynmo gestured for Leewi to speak as well.</p>
<p>Leewayi adjusted his non-existent glasses, his tone carrying the caution of a researcher. I agree with some of Miss Sue&#x27;s views. Knowledge itself has value, especially this information left over from ancient times, which may contain technological principles or historical truths that transcend our current understanding. Complete avoidance is not the solution, but safety must be the top priority. I propose that we start from two aspects.</p>
<p>First, continue to deepen internal research using the idea of common grammar to extract as muchformational value as possible from existing stone tablets and symbols while strengthening technological reserves in related fields such as more sophisticated observation instruments and exploration of the basic principles of remote detection technology. Second, externally we could try to contact some forces or lone wolves like the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood who are interested in knowledge itself but seem to have certain rules of conduct judging from their reputation for being straightforward in transactions and not easily resorting to violence to conduct extremely limited and highly guarded academic exchanges exchanging only non-core desensitized information fragments. The goal is to obtain the general outline of their research directions and possible technological preferences, not specific secrets. After the four finished speaking, each had their own emphasis, but the core consensus was clear. They could not be rash and the foundation had to be solid, but they could not be completely closed off either, and they needed to be sensitive to external changes and take low-risk approaches to obtain information and exert limited influence.</p>
<p>Lynn Emo listened quietly, his finger lightly tracing the edge of the nautical chart. These opinions largely coincided with his thoughts over the past few days. I understand what everyone means, Lyno finally said. To sum it up, it s about stabilizing the interior while exploring the exterior, combining the real and the faint. He stood up and walked to the nautical chart.</p>
<p>Internally, all established plans remain unchanged and may even be strengthened. Sure. How? Continue cold weather training while adding subjects for dealing with complex sea areas such as dense fog and undercurrents. Increase the frequency of routine inspections of the island defense system by 30%. Shen do ensure the stability and redundancy of the core material supply chain.</p>
<p>At the same time, according to your plan, increase investment in the intelligence networks in the southwest and north. The goal is not to spy on core secrets, but to grasp the general trend and key transaction flows. Some unconventional resources can be used, but they must be concealed. Understood. Sure.</p>
<p>How? And Shin Duodo replied in unison. Suchan Leeway Linmo turned to them. Your research continues. It has our long-term capital. We can begin a feasibility study on the idea of small-scale scientific reconnaissance and external academic contact.</p>
<p>Suchian, you are responsible for assessing possible methods of remote environmental observation and listing the required technological foundation and resources. Leeway, you are responsible for drafting a list of potential topics for academic exchange and a risk control plan. Remember, the bottom line is never to expose our core findings and locations. Su Chian and Leewi nodded seriously. As for actively guiding or leaking information, Lyno looked at Chiian Duo Duo.</p>
<p>We can try, but we must be extremely careful. We should start with some scraps that are difficult to verify and whose origins are unclear and observe the market reaction, paying particular attention to the movements of Dragon Soul and channels suspected to be related to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Our goal is not to create chaos, but to make the pond ripple as we need to see it. He returned to his seat, his tone calm. At this stage, we will not proactively intervene in any conflict, nor will we delve into any known dangerous remnants.</p>
<p>But we must know more clearly than ever before where the wind is coming from, and where the waves might be heading. We must make our ships stronger, our watchtowers higher, and our nautical charts more detailed. When the day comes that we have to make a choice, or when an opportunity truly arrives, we must ensure that we have enough leverage and a clear vision to make that move. After the meeting, everyone went their separate ways to fulfill their duties. Lynn Mo remained alone in the council chamber, his gaze returning to the sea chart.</p>
<p>The mark of the Mo Yuan pavilion stood firmly in the center, while gray and blue markings representing the unknown and uncertain surrounded it. His decision was to consolidate the center while simultaneously casting out a more delicate and cautious net of perception. Development is the fundamental principle and intelligence is the lifeline. Before achieving overwhelming strength, wisdom and patience are the best weapons. He knew the real test might be yet to come, but preparations must now enter a new and more proactive phase.</p>
<p>He wasn&#x27;t seeking immediate gains, but rather a step-by-step approach. In this sea of both crisis and opportunity, this might be the most suitable course for the Mo Yuan Pavilion. Chapter 90, Silent Clash. The strategy decided in the meeting was like a gust of wind which turned certain gears of the intricate machine that is Moyuan pavilion adding a touch of outward exploration to its operating rhythm but the overall rhythm remained as steady as a rock. Internal preparations remained rigorous.</p>
<p>Sherhow&#x27;s cold weather reserve team added a new training subject formation navigation and communication maintenance in dense fog environments conducting drills using the naturally formed fog at dawn. The team members wore simple fogproof masks made of oil soaked cotton cloth and wooden frames. The ships maintained contact using ropes, bells, and whistles of a specific rhythm, moving slowly and cautiously across the extremely low visibility. The process was bumpy with several near collisions, but experience was gained precisely in these realistic challenging situations. The defensive patrol routes for the main island and several important outlying islands were reoptimized.</p>
<p>The shift changes at lookout posts became irregular and the concealed placement of infrared stones, stones obtained through daily check-ins that slowly emit heat and are vaguely detected by speciallymade crystals, was increased, forming a silent early warning network. Such an Leewi&#x27;s collaboration grew increasingly seamless. The expanded experimental data from the environmental stabilizer continued to accumulate, initially validating its repeatability and environmental adaptability. Based on this data, Sue Chian began planning to concentrate several stabilizers in the core area of the newly built integrated plantation to maximize yield increases. Lewi, meanwhile, was engrossed in his academic exchange plan and remote observation scheme design.</p>
<p>For the former, he developed a detailed topic ladder, ranging from the most public discussions on ancient climate and geological speculation to slightly more in-depth comparisons of different symbolic systems and then to abstract discussions involving energy pathway logic that required strict oversight. Each level clearly indicated the scope of information that could be revealed and the expected exchange objectives. The latter was more challenging, limited by technical conditions. His proposed solutions such as tethered deep sea temperature/solinity probes and tall tower long-d distanceance optical observation mirrors faced significant difficulties in terms of materials, accuracy or operation and could only remain at the paperbased stage for the time being. The real ripples began to appear in the external intelligence network that Chi and Duo Duo was in charge of.</p>
<p>Following Lin Moe&#x27;s instruction to combine reality and illusion, he carefully selected several seemingly unrelated but actually indirectly controlled information channels and began releasing vague fragments of information about the northern anomaly. The content was meticulously crafted, mentioning the observation of a rare warm current pulse in the ice flow area causing local ice instability and suggesting possible submarine geothermal activity. describing the abnormal crystallization morphology of rocks at the edge of the fissures, leading to speculation about mineral specificity and even fabricating a rumor that a caravan accidentally retrieved a piece of floating ice debris with burn marks and unknown metal inlays and then mysteriously disappeared. This information was a mixture of truth and falsehood, vague in detail and not very specific, but it cleverly avoided core sensitive points such as the Hemlock Island slab symbols and the clear structure of the ruins, mainly focusing on geographical, geological, and physical phenomena. The news spread slowly like oil droplets in water.</p>
<p>Discussions about the shattered ice zone subtly rose in popularity on trading channels and in several regional underground intelligence markets. Dragon Soul didn&#x27;t publicly respond, but Chind Woodworth&#x27;s informants reported a slight but consistent increase in anonymous orders for coldresistant exploration equipment and highdefinition observation lenses at several large trading posts under Dragon Souls control within a week of the news&#x27;s spread. Meanwhile, gray trading channels suspected of being linked to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood also showed a noticeable increase in their willingness and offers to purchase ancient metal fragments and non-natural energy disturbance recording carriers such as specific minerals, crystals that may record images, etc. The fish are starting to react, though it&#x27;s still very slight. Chandou reported to Lenmo Dragon Soul has indeed been closely monitoring the situation, and they have the resources to do so.</p>
<p>starting technical preparations. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s interest in energy and ancient artifacts is very clear. It&#x27;s practically become their acquisition tactic. If any of the information we release touches on these topics, even slightly, they&#x27;ll start to move. Lynn Mo nodded.</p>
<p>Maintain this lowintensity information infiltration and pay attention to the subtle differences in the reactions of different forces, especially the Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. see which type of information they&#x27;re more sensitive to and how their subsequent actions differ. Understood. Dot Shin Duo Duo paused then lowered his voice. Also, there new progress in the southwest in Misty Bay.</p>
<p>One of our informants posing as a down on his luck building materials dealer successfully made contact with a mid-level leader of a remnant of the Wings of Liberty. He traded a batch of cheap lowquality timber and fresh water for some information and even saw something die. Oh, Lynn Mo gestured for him to continue. That kid got drunk and started bragging, saying they don&#x27;t lack daredevils, but they lack craftsmen who know how to build and tinker with complex mechanisms. They are indeed building a fortress on a sheltered island deep in the bay, but it&#x27;s not purely for defense.</p>
<p>It seems they&#x27;re going to install some big stuff inside, requiring meticulous installation. He also complained that the people from the society who came a few days ago were arrogant and picky about the goods but the stuff they gave was actually useful. Chindwood was eyes gleamed. I had my informant deliberately steer the conversation toward the society and that kid wasn&#x27;t tight lipped letting slip a little the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood traded several sets of complex gear sets and transmission blueprints for a box of thick dark stone slabs covered in scribbles completely useless that they had looted before. His exact words were, &quot;A pile of broken stones for a working mechanism.</p>
<p>What a bargain. Black stone slabs, scribbles.&quot; Lynmo and Leeway exchange a glance, both thinking of the stone slabs on Hemlock Island. Although they might not be the same type, their properties might be similar. It seems the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is indeed systematically collecting information on ancient artifacts and is even willing to exchange them for practical technical drawings, Leewi said in a low voice. Their thirst for knowledge or rather their search for specific keys is very persistent.</p>
<p>The remnants of the wings of freedom have acquired much neededed construction technology which may allow them to recover their strength even faster. Moreover, the things they build may go beyond the scope of ordinary fortresses to sure how s expression was solemn. Does your informant have any chance of seeing the big guy or the blueprints? Lynn Emmo asked. Chin duo duo shook his head. The security is very tight.</p>
<p>That kid isn&#x27;t high enough level to get close to the core area. He only saw them using pulley systems to hoist large metal components from afar. The shapes were irregular, unlike ordinary house beams and columns. It&#x27;s even less likely that he could see the blueprints. Information remains fragmented, but another piece of the puzzle has been added.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and the remnants of the Wings of Liberty have engaged in a substantial transaction. The former acquires ancient information carriers while the latter gains technology to enhance themselves. In the short term, this combination makes the remnants more difficult to deal with. In the long term, it makes the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s mysterious organization&#x27;s foundation and intentions even more unfathomable. Continue to monitor the situation, focusing on figuring out their construction progress and the possible uses of that big guy.</p>
<p>If possible, try to contact those within their ranks who are dissatisfied with the current situation or have doubts about the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s dealings, but ensure their safety. It&#x27;s better to give up than to expose yourself. Lynn Mo instructed against this kind of enemy. Internal division might be more effective than a direct external attack, though it&#x27;s also riskier. Yes.</p>
<p>She and Duo Duo accepted the order. After the meeting, Lin Mo went alone to the high point of the dock. In the distance, the sea and sky stretched endlessly. While nearby, ships came and went, and the sounds of craftsmen hammering never ceased. Moan pavilion was steadily growing stronger, but the disturbances and threats from the outside world, like the tides, rose one after another, and were becoming increasingly complex.</p>
<p>The Wings of Liberty are clearly enemies, but they are shrouded in secrecy, making them easy to defend and difficult to attack. The relationship with Dragon Soul is one of both cooperation and competition, with each side testing the waters and their bottom lines remaining unclear. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is a completely unknown third party with vastly different objectives, making them difficult to fathom. His information network had begun to pick up some faint signals. His spies in the southwest were also sending back valuable intelligence.</p>
<p>But this was only the beginning. The real confrontation often lay not in a clash of swords, but in these silent battles for information, resource competition, and strategic foresight. He needs more patience and sharper insight. Moan Pavilion is like a warship being equipped with more sophisticated observation and aiming equipment and a more powerful propulsion system. Before it truly enters the storm zone, it needs to continuously improve itself and see every detail of the storm as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>A cool sea breeze blew. Lin Moe&#x27;s gaze swept across the bustling dock, taking in the warehouse area, training grounds, and research workshops. Everything here was his foundation for facing future changes. and every ripple in the outside world. Every piece of the puzzle helped him to more clearly outline the contours of that unknown sea.</p>
<p>The silent battle has begun. He and his Muan pavilion must proceed cautiously, navigating this complex game to secure the most advantageous position for themselves. Time remains one of his most important allies. Chapter 91. Unexpected visitor.</p>
<p>In the late autumn of Mayuan Pavilion, the sea breeze blows stronger day by day, adding a richer blend of busyiness and tranquility. Leeway&#x27;s research has finally achieved a breakthrough, albeit a small one. While continuously comparing the common grammatical points of different symbol systems, he combined his previous repeated study of the energy path of the Hemlock Island slab with the fragments of information he recently received from Shand Duo Duo about the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood exchanging black slabs and suddenly had a new conjecture about a group of previously difficult to classify composite symbols in a certain edge area of the slab. We previously thought this set of symbols might represent a secondary energy circuit or an auxiliary function interface, Leewwayi said, pointing to the redrawn analytical diagram with shining eyes. But after repeatedly comparing it with the commonalities of the status indicators we summarized, as well as the indirect expressions in the Dragon Soul symbols that seem to represent external devices or expansion modules, we discovered that its core might not be interface, but rather verification association.</p>
<p>He pointed to several key turning points and connections on the drawing. Look here. The way the brush strokes here are very similar to the symbols we&#x27;ve already deciphered that represent permission, but more complex. It doesn&#x27;t point to the master verification at the core of the slate, but rather to one or more specific auxiliary units or supporting devices outside the slate itself. It&#x27;s more like an identification code or pairing identifier used to confirm whether an external device is authorized to connect and exchange data with the slate system.</p>
<p>Suchian leaned closer to examine it closely, trying to sense it and slowly nodded, &quot;I do have that feeling. This item is exclusive. Please do not contact without permission.&quot; Has an extra layer of exclusivity and specificity compared to a simple interface description. Lyn Mo looked at the blueprints thoughtfully. You mean the Hemlock Island slabs aren&#x27;t isolated? They might have accompanying auxiliary devices that require a specific identification code to activate or use.</p>
<p>And these devices might be the key components for completing the verification license or connecting to the energy source. Very likely, Leeway said excitedly. This explains many contradictions. Why does the stone slab itself seem incomplete? Why is the verification permission so abstract and difficult to understand? Because it may just be a control console or identity authentication center. The real operating authority or power pathways are in the hands of those scatter terminals that require specific keys.</p>
<p>The identification codes represented by these symbols to access. The stonemason brothers collection of stone slabs or metal plates with symbols may be in search of these scattered terminals or a list containing the identification codes. If this inference holds true, it is of great significance. It not only explains part of the mystery surrounding the Hemlock Island slate, but also subtly outlines a possible decentralized ancient system architecture. It also indirectly confirms that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s goals may have been extremely systematic and long-term they were attempting to piece together the entirety of this system.</p>
<p>This discovery is very important. Continue to explore this direction and try to deduce more possible identification code structures or features. Lynn Emmo affirmed. In addition, try to integrate this idea into your academic exchange proposal without revealing the actual stone slab and specific symbols as a tople exploratory topic to see if we can get any confirmation or rebuttal from the outside. Understood.</p>
<p>Leeway threw himself into the new simulation work with great enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Sue Chanchian&#x27;s comprehensive plantation plan entered the implementation phase. The core area was selected on a sunny, gentle slope on the southeast side of the main island. After leveling and preliminary soil improvement, functional zones were divided. The first batch of coldresistant tuber crops and improved fast growing vegetable seeds had been sewn.</p>
<p>Five environmental stabilizers were carefully placed at several key energy nodes in the park. These were fuzzy locations based on Leewi speculation about the distribution of energy in ancient symbols purely experimental. Such Chanchian recorded data and observed changes every day. Although she couldn&#x27;t see obvious results in the short term, she enjoyed it immensely. This work made her feel grounded as if she were personally drawing a blueprint for the future of food.</p>
<p>Sure, how focused the training on handling emergencies and rapid response. He designed several different alarm signals and corresponding emergency plans and organized several unannounced emergency assemblies and island defense drills from initial chaos to later orderliness. The Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s Guard force quietly became more refined and efficient through realistic combat training. He also took time to thoroughly inspect the holes, rigging, and weapon systems of storm sailboats and several main warships, ensuring that these core mobile forces were always in good working order. Chandwa&#x27;s intelligence network through its continued operation has captured some intriguing details.</p>
<p>Regarding the ice flow area, after the initial flurry of vague information, market discussion has subsided, but genuine observers don&#x27;t seem to have left. On the Dragon Soul side, it was discovered that a small fleet disguised as a research expedition had ventured near the edge of the ice flow area during an extreme weather window, briefly stopping and seemingly conducting some kind of hydraological or geological sampling before quickly retreating. Meanwhile, channels associated with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood still have listings for purchasing ice core samples with regular markings and deep seabed rock cores with generous rewards. In the southwestern Misty Bay direction, the frequency of messages relayed by informants decreased as the remnants of the Wings of Liberty appeared to have completed their initial assembly and infrastructure construction and the screening of outsiders became exceptionally strict. However, sporadic reports still emerged.</p>
<p>Their fortress was beginning to take shape with heavily fortified outer walls. The assembly of some large component was indeed underway inside with frequent heavy metallic clanging sounds and the creaking of large pulley systems. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s speciallymade speedboats appeared again, but their stay was brief, seemingly only completing a handover before quickly departing. Amidst this seemingly calm yet turbulent atmosphere, an unexpected visitor quietly approached the outer sea area of Mayuan Pavilion. The visitor was a medium-sized three-masted sailing ship, plain in style, but well-maintained, flying a plain flag without any insignia of power.</p>
<p>It did not attempt to enter the core shipping lanes of the Moan Pavilion or approach the main island, but instead anchored near a public supply point on the outskirts established by the Moan Pavilion for safe trade with scattered caravans or lone travelers. dispatching a small boat carrying three people, waving a friendly signal flag, requesting informal and friendly dialogue with the leaders of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. The patrol boat on duty quickly reported the situation. Linmo was checking the latest warehouse inventory when he received the report. Have you ascertained their purpose and identity? Lynmo asked the guard captain who came to report.</p>
<p>They only said they represented a group of friends who are interested in ancient knowledge and have no intention of being enemies with any power and wanted to exchange ideas on common areas of interest. The leader was a woman who called herself Vera and she was wellmannered. The other two seemed to be attendants or guards. The ship was inspected. It was not obviously armed and there weren&#x27;t many people on board, the captain of the guard replied.</p>
<p>They seemed very disciplined and did not show any aggression or probing intent. ancient knowledge. Lynn Mo&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. Had the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood found a new way to contact them or was it another similar force? Notify Shir how to strengthen covert surveillance around that supply point. Have Chin Duo prepared to make contact as the trade manager and probe their intentions.</p>
<p>Such Chian Leewi and I will listen from behind the scenes. Lynn, Emo quickly made the arrangements. Remember, be polite, but keep your distance. Find out who they are and what they want. Yes.</p>
<p>An hour later, under a makeshift semi-open seaside pavilion set up at the supply point, Chi and Dodu met the visitor who called herself Vera. Linmo, Su Chanchian, and Leewi, on the other hand, were observing the meeting from a nearby disguised observation house using hidden gaps and a simple sound transmission device using hollow bamboo tubes and thin membranes. Vera was a woman in her early 30s dressed in a practical dark blue travel outfit. Her long brown hair was neatly tied back. Her appearance wasn&#x27;t particularly striking, but her eyes were clear and focused, exuding a scholarly calmness.</p>
<p>She introduced herself as an independent archaeologist, part of a small group of like-minded friends who focused on collecting and studying artifacts and information from ancient civilizations around the world. We heard of the Muan Pavilion, especially some of their transactions during the time of Mr. Jay and weary very interested in certain special items that your side may have come in contact with. Vera said calmly and a moderate pace. We have no ill intentions, nor do we belong to any known major power.</p>
<p>We believe that the value of knowledge lies in sharing and deciphering, not in hoarding or using it for force. Our visit is to establish a possible channel for information exchange based on equal exchange. We also have some rubbings of symbols and records of artifact characteristics collected from various ruins which may corroborate your existing discoveries. She duo duo smiled broadly and chuckled. Oh dear Miss Vera, you flatter me too much.</p>
<p>Our Mayu pavilion is just a place where we do small business and try to live a peaceful life. Those ancient relics and symbols you mentioned are too profound. We may occasionally come across some strange and unusual things, but we only sell them as handiccrafts or materials. We don&#x27;t know anything about researching them. Vera smiled slightly, undeterred, and took out several carefully protected rubbings from her leather pouch, placing them on the table.</p>
<p>Manager Chien, there is no need for an immediate reply. These are rubbings of symbols we recently discovered at a shallow relic site on the Eastern Sleeping Ridge with a rather unique style. Perhaps your researchers would be interested in taking a look. Regardless of whether there is any intention to cooperate, these copies of the rubbings can serve as a token of our goodwill. Looking inside the room, Leewi&#x27;s breath hitched slightly when he saw the patterns on the rubbings.</p>
<p>Suchan also let out a soft lin sharpened. Those symbols were different from those provided by the hemlock island slabs and the dragon soul. They represented a third independent style. But Leewi immediately and keenly caught a familiar shadow of a common grammatical point in the winding stroke say state fine-tuning technique. Chin duo duo naturally noticed the interest signal wei had sent through a hidden hand gesture.</p>
<p>His smile remained unchanged as he took the rubbing, examined it carefully, pretending to be trying hard to decipher it, and then laughed. Oh dear, this drawing is quite abstract. Since Miss Vera is so kind, we&#x27;ll accept this gift without hesitation. However, this matter of cooperation and exchange is of great importance, and I need to go back and discuss it thoroughly with our leader. How about you rest at the supply point for a couple of days? We&#x27;ll let you know as soon as we have any news.&quot; Vera nodded gracefully.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s only right. We&#x27;ll be waiting on the ship, looking forward to your good news.&quot; The first encounter ended in a polite and cautious atmosphere. Vera and her group returned to their sailboat in a small boat. She and Dodu carrying the rubbing quickly returned to the observation house. How is it? Lynn Emmo asked.</p>
<p>They danti seem like members of the stonemasons brotherhood. Their temperament and way of doing things are different. They re more academic and they v proactively presented valuable new samples as a stepping stone. Chin duo duo analyzed. But we can&#x27;t t completely rule out the possibility that it has some kind of organization in disguise.</p>
<p>Although their ships are ordinary, a closer look at their maintenance and certain details reveals that they not something an average individual could do. Dot. Leewi couldn&#x27;t wait to take the rubbing and began to study it carefully with Sue Chian. His face occasionally showing a thoughtful and excited expression. Lynn and Mo looked at the threemasted sailing ship quietly mored on the distant sea.</p>
<p>Would this unexpected visitor bring new opportunities or new risks? At a time when various forces were eyeing the ancient ruins covetously, the appearance of this group calling themselves independent researchers seemed particularly abrupt and intriguing. Don&#x27;t rush to reply, Lyno said thoughtfully. Leeway, you and Sue Chian analyze these new rubbings with all your might and see what conclusions you can draw. Chin duo duo. Use your network to find out as much as possible about this Vera and the group behind her.</p>
<p>The more detailed the better. Sure. How? Don&#x27;t let your guard down on the perimeter. He needed more information to determine the true nature of these unexpected visitors, what leverage they held, and what their motives were. It seemed another unidentified piece had been added to the chessboard of this sea area.</p>
<p>Chapter 92. Rubbing Identification. Vera&#x27;s appearance was like a pebble thrown into a pond, creating ripples on the calm surface of Mo Yuan Pavilion. Linmo&#x27;s orders were swiftly executed. Leewi and Sue Chanchian immediately immersed themselves in the newly imprinted symbols, while Chin Duo Duo used multiple intelligence networks to try to sketch out the vague outline of Vera and the independent researchers group behind her.</p>
<p>The rubbings from the sleeping ridge were carefully laid out on the long table in Leeway&#x27;s workspace. The lighting was adjusted to the most suitable angle and Leeway even took out a simple magnifying glass set and tracing tools that he had received from signing it earlier. Such an on the other hand prepared a new notebook ready to perceive and describe it from her perspective of rhythm. The rubbing appears to be on some kind of fine sandstone slab. The symbols are deeply engraved and the edges are slightly blurred due to erosion over time, but the overall condition is much better than the stone slab on Hemlock Island, which have been subjected to the pressure of mineral veins.</p>
<p>The style of the symbols is indeed quite different from any I&#x27;ve seen before. They are more fluid, lacking the cold geometric feel of the Hemlock Island symbols, and without the ruggedness and abruptness of those symbols provided by the dragon soul. Instead, they have a continuous rhythm similar to scroll work or waves, but the transitions still reveal a clear regularity and intention. It has a truly unique style that Leeway muttered to himself as he carefully examined the direction and depth of the engravings with a magnifying glass. The carving tools were probably more refined or the stone was softer.</p>
<p>Look at the end of this curve. It is very smooth and natural. It doesn&#x27;t tea look like it was chiseled, but rather like it was grinded with some kind of high-speed rotating hard tool dot. Su Chian closed her eyes and concentrated, her fingers hovering above the rubbings, slowly moving them to try and capture that rhythm. After a long while, she opened her eyes, a hint of confusion and surprise in them.</p>
<p>It feels very different. The Hemlock Island symbols feel like calm instructions and frameworks to me, while the Dragon Soul symbols feel like straightforward marks and warnings. These are more like a description or record, even carrying a touch of lyricism, describing a certain state, recording a certain process, but at the core, that unnatural, meticulously designed sense of order still exists. It&#x27;s definitely not a natural pattern, description, or record. Leeway pondered.</p>
<p>If we combine this with our previous conjectures about identification codes and distributed terminals, could it be part of some kind of operation log or device status record? Look at this combination of consecutive symbols. It seems to express a dynamic process. Initiation, stable, C intervention, application of energy or action, C change, parameter adjustment, C stability, new state achieved. The symbolic expression of this change stage in its core style is highly similar to the common grammatical point I summarize for representing state fine-tuning. It asks just that here it s embedded in a more complex and narrative string of symbols.</p>
<p>This discovery greatly encouraged the two men. If these new symbols were indeed some kind of log or record, then the information they contained about how ancient systems operated might be more valuable than mere control commands. it could reveal the process, not just the result. For the next two days, Leewi and Sue Chanchian devoted themselves almost tirelessly to the analysis. They tried to use known common grammatical points as anchors to decipher the possible structures in the new symbol strings.</p>
<p>Progress was slow, but not without results. They initially identified several recurring symbol fragments that appear to represent time units, energy level scales, and operator identifiers. Possibly. More importantly, at the end of a relatively complete symbol sequence, they discovered an independent symbol that had a subtle connection to the transitional habits of the Hemlock Island Slate identification code symbols. It was like a signature or confirmation mark engraved alone at the end.</p>
<p>This is very likely the identification code of the terminal device corresponding to this record or at least some kind of identifier related to it. Leeway excitedly pointed to the symbol. Although we can&#x27;t decipher what it specifically refers to, its existence itself confirms the existence of distributed terminals and identification systems. The ruins that Vera and the others discovered may be the remains of a terminal or a place where records were stored. Meanwhile, Shin Dudwa&#x27;s investigation also yielded initial results.</p>
<p>through several clandestine channels specializing in selling intelligence and background information. And by expending considerable resources, he finally pieced together some fragments of information about Vera and her group. Vera seems to have a reputation in several high-end small academic exchange circles and the black market for rare ancient books and materials. Chi and Dodu reported to Lyno, &quot;Her reputation is quite polarized. Some people think she&#x27;s a pure scholar, knowledgeable, fair in her dealings, only interested in solving ancient mysteries, and never involved in power struggles.</p>
<p>Others think she and the group behind her are too mysterious, highly capable, and always able to find some obscure but important clues to relics. They believe there must be some unknown support behind her, and she may not really be as independent as she seems. There are many different opinions about the group behind her. Some say it is a secret society composed of several like-minded scholars. Some say it is a research team funded by the descendants of a fallen noble family.</p>
<p>And there are even outrageous rumors that they have ties to the Stonem&#x27;s Brotherhood, but parted ways due to ideological differences. The only generally accepted fact is that they&#x27;re probably not many in number. But the core members seem to be top experts in various professional fields, archaeology, semiodics, geology, ancient engineering, and they seem to have mastered some unique techniques for detecting and interpreting relics. Chanduo paused, then added, &quot;Furthermore, there are unconfirmed reports that they recently had some unpleasant contact with the Stonem&#x27;s Brotherhood, seemingly over priority access to explore a newly discovered site. They apparently reached a compromise, but the relationship seemed strained.</p>
<p>This might explain why they approached us. See, perhaps they&#x27;re looking for a new powerful partner or source of information to counterbalance or bypass the Stonem&#x27;s Brotherhood. LenMo tapped his fingers lightly on the table. Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s background was more complex than he had anticipated. They weren&#x27;t the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, but they were equally deeply involved in the field of ancient ruins and possessed considerable strength and technology.</p>
<p>Their potential competition with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood aligned with their claim of independence and increased the credibility of their contact with the Ink Abyss Pavilion. The enemy of my enemy could at least be a temporary friend or a useful source of information. Havly Wei and the others come to any conclusions in their analysis. Lynn Mo asked just as I was about to report. Engineer Lee and Miss Sue made an important discovery.</p>
<p>Those new rubbings are likely a kind of operation log and contain symbols that appear to be terminal identification codes confirming the hypothesis of distributed terminals. A glint of light flashed in Linmo&#x27;s eyes. The stepping stone Vera brought was indeed invaluable. It wasn&#x27;t just a new set of symbol samples. It was a crucial clue that could verify and advance their own research.</p>
<p>It seems that Miss Vera has shown more sincerity than we expected, Linmo pondered. But we still need to clarify her true intentions. Is she simply looking to exchange information? Or does she want to draw us into their competition with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood? Or perhaps she has a deeper scheme? He pondered for a moment and made a decision. She and Duo Duo, in your name, invite Miss Vera to a second meeting at the supply depot tomorrow morning. This time, Leewi and I will happen to be present.</p>
<p>Note that Leeway and I are the island lord with a slight interest in ancient symbols and a craftsman responsible for material appraisal and incidentally studying miscellaneous subjects. The conversation will revolve around the rubbings she provided. Listen to her insights on these symbols and also appropriately reveal some of our vague impressions about the common ground of the symbols that we accidentally discovered and see her reaction. Understood, boss. I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.</p>
<p>Chin duo duo understood immediately. The next morning, the seaside pavilion was once again set up as a meeting place. This time, Linmo and Leewi sat inside beforehand with tea and some dried fruit, a local specialty of the island on the table, chatting casually. Chin Duo Duo stood to the side, waiting. Vera arrived on time in a small boat, still accompanied by only two attendants.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t seem surprised to see two more people in the pavilion as if she had expected it. Manager Chien, I apologize for bothering you again. Vera smiled and nodded, then turned her gaze to Lin Mo and Leewi. And who are these two? Oh, let me introduce you. Chin Duo Duo said with a warm smile, &quot;This is Lin Mo, the leader of our Muan Pavilion, and this is Leewi, the manager of our workshop.</p>
<p>The leader happened to be inspecting this area today and heard that Miss Vera brought some interesting rubbings of ancient artifacts. He was also very interested, so he came over to take a look. Manager Lee usually likes to tinker with some strange and unusual things and has some knowledge of engravings and symbols. So, it&#x27;s Chief Lynn and Steuart Lee. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Vera bowed to the two men with composure. Her gaze lingered on Lin Mo&#x27;s face for a moment, calm and unwavering before turning to Leeway. Seeing the magnifying glass and tracing paper beside him, a knowing smile flashed in her eyes. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the conversation naturally turned to the rubbings. Vera spoke first, her tone calm and professional.</p>
<p>After reviewing the rubbings we left for you last time, I wonder if your researchers have made any interesting discoveries or have any thoughts. Our team&#x27;s preliminary judgment is that this may be an inscription about the maintenance or status record of some kind of ancient equipment. Unfortunately, we have only just begun to decipher its symbol system. Leeway glanced at Linmo and after receiving tacid approval continued. Ms.</p>
<p>Vera, you&#x27;re too kind. We&#x27;re just looking around. The style of these symbols is indeed unique, quite different from the few we&#x27;ve seen by chance before. But coincidentally, when I compared them, I felt that the habits of the strokes when these symbols express certain processes of change seem to have a slight inexplicable similarity to some other ancient engravings we&#x27;ve seen. It&#x27;s the kind of technique used to handle transitions of states.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t mention any specific symbols or locations, but rather offered a very vague observation about common ground. Vera&#x27;s eyes lit up slightly upon hearing this, and she leaned forward slightly. Oh, manager Lee also has this feeling. To be honest, our team also vaguely noticed a similar phenomenon when comparing the symbols of different ruins. It seems that there are some more fundamental rules of expression or technical language logic that transcend a single symbol system.</p>
<p>The fact that your side can notice this shows that you also have considerable accumulation in semiotics. She paused, seemingly considering her words before continuing. We believe that these common points across the ruins may be the key to unlocking the entire technological system of ancient civilizations. I wonder if your side would be willing on the basis of mutual trust to engage in a deeper exchange regarding the discovery and speculation of these common points. We can provide more simple samples and analytical notes from different ruins in exchange.</p>
<p>The conversation began to touch on the core issues. Lenimo picked up his teacup, gently blew on it, and didn&#x27;t answer immediately. He was observing Vera, observing her expression, her eyes, and her choice of words. It seemed that she indeed attached great importance to the research direction of common ground, and was willing to pay a substantial price for it. Academic exchange is naturally a good thing.</p>
<p>Do Len Mo put down his teacup and spoke slowly, his tone calm, but with a hint of detachment. However, Emo Yuan Pavilion is still in its early stages, and its primary concern is survival and development. Our interest in these ancient relics is limited to satisfying some curiosity and seeing if we can find some inspiration that is useful for the present. Inepth and targeted exchanges and cooperation involve many considerations. We have received Ms.</p>
<p>Vera&#x27;s proposal, but we need time to discuss it internally. Dot. He neither refused nor agreed, giving a response very much in line with the identity of a cautious island owner. Vera seemed unsurprised and nodded understandingly. Chief Lynn&#x27;s caution is entirely understandable.</p>
<p>Exploring ancient secrets is certainly attractive, but focusing on the present is fundamental. We will not force anything. This visit is mainly to express goodwill and establish initial contact. These rubbings and some related basic analysis notes are left with you as a small gift. Regardless of whether there is an opportunity to cooperate in the future, we hope that these materials will be of some help to you.</p>
<p>She once again demonstrated her sincerity by proactively providing more information. The meeting ended in a polite but reserved atmosphere. Vera made no further demands, politely took her leave, boarded her ship, and indicated that they would stay in the outer waters for a few days to await the final reply from the Mo Yuan pavilion, but would not cause any disturbance. Watching the sailboat disappear into the distance. Lynn Emo whispered to Chi and Duo.</p>
<p>They are very patient and strategic. What they gave us was substantial. Continue investigating, especially the specific details of their conflict with the Stonemasons Brotherhood. Leeway, you two hurry up and digest the new notes she gave us. We need to determine whether the limited and highly controlled exchange of information with them is more beneficial or harmful.</p>
<p>A new choice lay before him. Would this suddenly appearing group of scholars be an aid in unraveling the mystery or a trigger for even greater trouble? Lynn Mo needed to weigh the options, deciding how to proceed while ensuring the safety and development of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. Chapter 93. Prudent cooperation. The arrival and departure of Vera&#x27;s team did not cause much of a stir within the Mo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>Most members were unaware that such a fleet had ever visited the outer regions. However, within the core circle, discussions on how to respond to this proposed academic exchange took place meticulously and cautiously. That same evening after their second meeting, Lynn, Emo summons Shureh how she duo duo such and leeway back to the meeting room. The rubbing copy left by Vera in a neatly bound, meticulously handwritten analytical notebook were on the table. The notebook was detailed and logically clear, containing not only their initial interpretation of the sleeping ridge rubbings, but also appendices of simple comparisons and characteristic summaries of several other known symbolic styles.</p>
<p>It even cautiously raised several open-ended questions about cross-system commonalities, demonstrating a candid and academic approach. IV reviewed their work. It s very solid and of a very high standard. Leewi said first, his tone carrying an expression of approval for his colleagues. Their perspective on symbols is similar to ours, but their methodology is more systematic.</p>
<p>Several conjectures mentioned in their notes regarding energy flow representation and operational hierarchy identification have been very enlightening for me. The data samples they have may be even richer than we imagined. Such an nodded in agreement. The notes mention a method to help determine the age and function of relics based on the residual trace elements in the environment and the degree of weathering of rock straighta. Although it is only briefly described, the idea is very novel and it is also of reference value for my planning of plantation site selection and assessment of the long-term impact of environmental stabilizers.</p>
<p>Chin duo duo stroked his chin. From an intelligence perspective, the sincerity they&#x27;ve shown is indeed substantial. Moreover, the new information I&#x27;ve received basically confirms the claim that they are in competition with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. About a month ago, in the Echo Islands to the southeast, the two sides almost clashed over a small ruin that had just emerged from the seabed. Later, through some unknown negotiation, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood gained access to the ruin, but Vera&#x27;s team obtained complete surface mapping data and the right to sample the surrounding artifacts.</p>
<p>It sounds like a compromise between technical experts. Each getting what they wanted, but a grudge has been formed. Sure, how remained cautious. Technology is one thing, but people&#x27;s hearts are another. They approached us proactively, demonstrating their strength and expressing goodwill, so their demands must be substantial.</p>
<p>We can certainly gain some knowledge by cooperating with them, but could we be drawn into their conflict with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood? Or perhaps they want to use us to test or restrain the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Our current strength is already enough to deal with the remnants of the Wings of Liberty. And with the addition of the mysterious Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and this scholarly group with unclear backgrounds, the situation is far too complicated. Lynamo listened quietly to everyone&#x27;s opinions, his fingers unconsciously tracing the cover of Vera&#x27;s notebook. The notebook was made of paper of uniform texture, a rarity in this era, and the binding thread was some kind of synthetic fiber, revealing its exquisite details.</p>
<p>Leewi Sue Chian. If we only engage in very limited purely academic information exchange, for example, focusing only on the research direction of common grammatical points and offer some peripheral observations that do not involve specific archaeological sites or core symbols in exchange for similar observations of other symbol systems in their possession. Would that be of great help to your research? Are the risks manageable? Lynn Emmo asked. Leewi and Sue Chian exchange a glance. After careful consideration, Leewi replied, &quot;It will definitely help.</p>
<p>It can broaden our horizons, verify our ideas. It may even help us discover angles we&#x27;ve overlooked if we strictly limit the content of our exchange. Only discussing abstract methods and feature induction without involving any specific details that might expose the hemlock island slab or the dragon soul symbol. The risks should be manageable. It&#x27;s like two mathematicians discussing problem-solving strategies without revealing the original problem data they have.</p>
<p>Suchin added, &quot;Furthermore, we can require all communications to be conducted in encrypted one-time written form to avoid direct meetings and reduce the risk of being tracked or infiltrated. We can even designate a completely neutral third party location such as a recognized secure trading island for data delivery and reception.&quot; Chandwood was eyes lit up. This is a great idea. It maintains contact, obtains information, and minimizes the risk of contact. We could try one or two of these blind exchanges first to see their reactions and the quality of the information they provide before deciding whether to go deeper.</p>
<p>Sure, how thought for a moment and nodded. If it&#x27;s just written isolated communication without involving personnel exchanges or specific action coordination, I can accept it. But we must carefully review the exchange materials to ensure there are no hidden agendas or secret codes. The opinions of the group gradually converged. A trial, highly controlled, low-risk information exchange could be conducted to further assess Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s true intentions and potential value.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo finally made the decision. All right, let&#x27;s go with this approach. Chi and Duo Duo, you will send an encrypted message to various ship through a secure communication channel. The message is as follows. The Mo Yuan Pavilion is also interested in the study of the common points of ancient symbols and is willing to conduct preliminary non-directional academic discussions.</p>
<p>We propose that the first exchange of information be conducted in writing at the neutral exchange on Conchk Island, a covert intelligence hub controlled by Chen Duo Duo. The exchange topic is limited to the abstract stylistic features representing state transitions and energy levels in different symbol systems. Each party should provide no more than three pages of overview text and corresponding unattributed symbol examples, ensuring that the examples cannot be traced back to specific relics. We will send an anonymous messenger to complete the handover. If agreed, it will take place in 3 days.</p>
<p>He paused then emphasized the message implied that this was our only mode of cooperation and there was no guarantee that there would be any follow-up. If they accepted it meant they valued academic exchange more than anything else or they had enough patience. If they refused or made other demands then there was no need to continue. Understood? I&#x27;ll get on it right away. Chin Duo Duo immediately began preparations.</p>
<p>The encrypted message was sent out that evening via a clandestine carrier pigeon lake. Conchk Island was a small intelligence relay station established by Chandu Duo in his early days. It was located in a secluded place and used as a cover to run a general store. The shopkeeper was an old sea merchant whom Chiendu Duo had helped in his early years. He was loyal and reliable.</p>
<p>After the message was sent, there was only waiting. For the next 3 days, everything at Moanon Pavilion continued as usual. Training, production, research, and trade proceeded at a steady pace. However, the core members all paid closer attention, awaiting the other party&#x27;s response. During this time, Leewi and Su Chian meticulously prepared an overview for the exchange.</p>
<p>They extracted several of the most representative yet least easily traceable calligraphic features of state fine-tuning and hierarchical identification from the hemlock island slabs and dragon soul symbols. These features coupled with simplified illustrative symbols after some distortion were written in the most objective and descriptive language possible resulting in a 2 and 1/2page summary. This summary might be invaluable to true experts, but to layman it would be like a foreign language, and there was absolutely no possibility of it revealing any course secrets. On the morning of the third day, news came back from Conch Island. The exchange was complete.</p>
<p>As agreed, the other party provided three pages of handwritten materials and several corresponding simple example diagrams. The messenger described that the other party was a silent middle-aged scholar who, apart from confirming identity and exchanging items, did not utter a single word and quickly left after the handover. The information was brought back immediately and delivered to Leewi. He and Su Chian immediately began to study it. The level is very high.</p>
<p>Leewi couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim in a low voice after watching for only a short while. The seven variations of the energy level decay representation. they summarized are more systematic than I thought. In this they noticed the different symbol systems graphical distinction between birectional flow and unidirectional conduction and guess that this might be related to the design concept of the devices input and output ports. We haven&#x27;t thought about this angle in depth yet.</p>
<p>Such an also engrossed in watching the examples of symbols they provided although they were processed show that they come from at least four different styles of relics. One of them has a very unique rhythm, almost like a visual expression of music or sound waves. If that&#x27;s the case, then ancient civilizations may have mastered the technology of using specific frequencies for control or transmission. The insights gained from the new materials are enormous, even somewhat revolutionary. Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s depth and breadth of expertise in semiotics clearly surpasses that of a Moyua.</p>
<p>In this exchange, Mo Yunga traded some peripheral but crucial feature inductions for a more systematic and perspective richch methodological framework and typological samples, which from a purely knowledge exchange perspective was undoubtedly a gain. More importantly, the other party kept their promise, provided highquality materials, and did not attempt to include any suspicious information or make any additional requests. This increased their credibility to some extent. It seems they are serious scholars. At least they performed impeccably during this exchange.</p>
<p>After listening to Leewi and Sue Shian&#x27;s report, Lynn Emmo summarized, &quot;We can continue this low-risk written communication, not too frequently, and the topics can gradually become more in-depth, but the bottom line remains the same. Do not reveal specific information about the relics and do not involve any intentions for action. At the same time, Chin Duo Duo continued to investigate their background, especially the composition of their core members and the source of their funding. Understood, Chin Duo Duo replied. Also, there&#x27;s new information from the north and west.</p>
<p>Oh, the Dragon Souls research vessel went to the ice shatter zone again, this time staying for a slightly longer period. It seems they installed some kind of long-term monitoring device at the edge of the fissure. Our informants didn&#x27;t dare get too close, but they saw them lowering equipment down in a basket. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood showed no signs of approaching, but they&#x27;re increasing their purchases of anti-jamming communication components and deep water pressure resistant hall materials at several key trading points, possibly preparing as well. In the southwestern Misty Bay, the main structure of the wings of Liberty&#x27;s fortress appears to be complete, and more obstacles and early warning systems have recently been deployed around it.</p>
<p>There are indications that they may be testing that big guy inside as a continuous low humming sound has been heard for nearly an hour before stopping. All parties are taking action. Whether it&#x27;s probing, lying in weight, or developing their capabilities. The Mo Yuan Pavilion is no exception. This cautious collaboration with Vera&#x27;s team has opened a small door, adding a new potential channel for future intelligence networks and knowledge reserves.</p>
<p>Lyn and Mo walked to the window and looked out at the Azure Sea. The door to cooperation had opened a crack, letting in a few rays of new light, but the world outside remained full of unknowns and risks. He needed to strike a balance, neither letting this crack prematurely expose his weaknesses, nor failing to fully utilize it to observe and extract necessary information. Steady development, prudent cooperation, and a wait andsee approach remain the most suitable course for Muan Pavilion at this stage. However, the nautical charts and telescopes in their hands seem to have become slightly clearer and sharper.</p>
<p>This small improvement may be a necessary accumulation for dealing with even greater storms in the future. Chapter 94 frequent strange events. The first written exchange with Vera&#x27;s team was successfully completed, opening a window for Moyuan Pavilion to understand a broader world of ancient symbols, but it did not immediately change the main theme of the island&#x27;s operation. Days continued to roll forward amidst a mix of busyiness and tranquility. Only a subtle tension seemed to have been added to the air from all directions.</p>
<p>Such Chian&#x27;s integrated plantation ushered in the first round of crop germination. Under the influence of the carefully arranged environmental stabilizers, the tender green seedlings broke through the soil, their uniformity and robustness significantly better than the control area. This amazed the elderly farmers responsible for the actual cultivation and they looked at Sue Chanchian with more trust. Sue Chanchian&#x27;s daily data notebook grew thicker and thicker. She began to try to perform correlation analysis between the growth parameters of different crops and environmental indicators, temperature, humidity, light, changes in soil trace elements, attempting to find quantitative evidence of the stabilizer&#x27;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>This work was tedious and meticulous, requiring great patience, but she enjoyed it immensely. Lie eyes was immersed in the new ideas brought about by the materials provided by Vera&#x27;s team. Their systematic methodology and broader sample database greatly expanded his research horizons. He began to re-examine all the known symbols on the Hemlock Island slate, attempting to understand them using a new classification framework and set about designing a more rigorous common grammar point verification process. He realized that some of his previous conjectures might have relied too much on single samples and needed more cross validation to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Communication channels with Vera&#x27;s team remained silent. Both sides seem to tacitly need time to digest the results of their first exchange. Shh&#x27;s cold weather reserve team concluded another round of intensive training and conducted a 3-day comprehensive exercise. The simulated objective was to establish a temporary forward base and complete the transfer and guarding of specific supplies in complex environments characterized by severe cold, dense fog, and ice flows. The exercise exposed several problems such as the fragility of tools in low temperatures, insufficient communication reliability in fog, and a lack of efficient and safe equipment for landing in ice flow areas.</p>
<p>Sherhow noted these issues down and immediately organized improvements upon his return, contacting Shian Duodo to procure specific models of alloy tools with better toughness, asking Leeway to help design and improve the existing flag signaling and whistle communication rules and urging the ship rights to expedite the reinforcement of the anti-colision measures and the modification of the anti-skid decks on several spare speedboats. Just as Mo Yuan Pavilion was strengthening itself step by step, the intelligence network under Chiandua&#x27;s command like keen tentacles continued to capture every unusual movement in the outside world. First, regarding the ice rifts, Dragon Soul seems determined, having not only installed long-term monitoring equipment, but also recently deployed a significantly larger and more professional research fleet to the perimeter, attempting to deploy deep sea submersibles equipped with lighting and cameras into the rifts. This move is clearly no longer just observation, but carries explicit exploratory intent. However, the operation appears to be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Merchant ships passing through nearby waters claimed to have seen Dragon Souls fleet briefly retreat with some broken equipment debris floating on the surface, suggesting a possible malfunction or accident involving the submersibles. Dragon Soul subsequently strengthened security in the area, prohibiting other vessels from approaching, but exploration activities have not ceased, only become more cautious. Dragon Soul is determined to find out what&#x27;s down there. Chindidu coming to Leno. They&#x27;ve even used a deep sea submersible.</p>
<p>The investment is considerable. It seems that what&#x27;s in that rift is more attractive or more unsettling to Dragon Soul than we imagined, and we must find out as soon as possible. Secondly, there&#x27;s the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Their acquisition of anti-inference communication components and deep water pressurees shell materials continues unabated. Furthermore, Chindwood was informants have noticed that their agents at several key trading points have recently begun inquiring about highfrequency acoustic wave generators and specific frequency resonant crystals offering high prices but with extremely demanding requirements.</p>
<p>They looking for increasingly obscure and specific things. Chin Duo frowned. It seems they also preparing to explore some extreme environment and their technological approach might be different from Dragon Soul S. Is it more inclined towards acoustics or vibration technology? Could it be that something beneath the ice shards needs special sound waves to detect or activate the most eye-catching remnants of the wings of Liberty in a misty bay of the southwest? The low humming sound previously heard during tests of the big guy inside the fortress was not an isolated incident. According to reports from centuries stationed in the nearby waters to monitor the situation, this humming sound reappeared two or three more times in the following days, each lasting for varying durations, from a dozen minutes to nearly an hour.</p>
<p>The sound seemed to emanate from the core of the fortress deep in the bay. Even through the thick fog and waves, a faint, unsettling, and rhythmic vibration could still be faintly felt. What&#x27;s even more unsettling is that during the most recent instance of the buzzing sound, a reconnaissance speedboat from the pavilion patrolling the perimeter, maintaining a safe distance, observed unnatural disturbances in the cloud formations above Misty Bay. Faint but unusual arc-shaped flashes of light flickered deep within the clouds, accompanying the rhythmic buzzing. This phenomenon lasted for less than a minute, disappearing as the buzzing ceased.</p>
<p>electromagnetic phenomenon or some other energy leak. This was Leewi&#x27;s first thought upon hearing the description. If it were just mechanical operation, it&#x27;s unlikely to cause visible changes in the high altitude clouds. That big guy is probably more than just a large weapon or engineering machine. What kind of blueprints did the Stonemason brothers provide them with? Sure.</p>
<p>How&#x27;s expression was grim? Whatever it is, the longer the remnants of the wings of freedom control it, the greater the threat it poses to us and the surrounding areas. We must find out its true nature and potential power as soon as possible. Lynn Emmo frowned slightly as he synthesized the intelligence from various sources. The competition in exploring the shattered ice zone was escalating with technological means beginning to intervene. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s technological reserves and objectives were becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the remnants of the Wings of Freedom, the enemy they thought was hiding away to lick their wounds, seemed to have, with the aid of mysterious technology, cobbled together some kind of device with unknown energy characteristics. These unusual movements, viewed individually, might simply be the result of various forces acting according to their own logic. But taken together, they suddly paint a picture of an impending storm. The secrets of ancient ruins, lost technologies, and the ambitions and fears of various forces are intertwining and colliding in this sea. Increase surveillance of Misty Bay, but ensure secrecy and security.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo instructed Chien Duo Duo. Try to bribe or contact lower level personnel who may come out of the bay to purchase supplies. Focus on understanding the internal structure of the fortress, the appearance of that big guy, and the frequency and details of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s visits. Do not risk contacting core personnel. We will continue to monitor the movements of Dragon Soul and the Stonemason Brotherhood in the Shattered Eye Zone, especially their technological progress and the difficulties they encounter.</p>
<p>This will be helpful for us in assessing the risks and value internally. Expedite the preparation of all contingency plans. Sure. How develop corresponding emergency plans for potential energy interference or abnormal weather. Leeway pay attention to the list of unconventional technical materials sought by the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood and assess their potential applications and technical principles.</p>
<p>Sue Chian ensure the production and stockpiling of core survival supplies. A series of clear instructions were issued. The ship Mayuan Pavilion began to subtly adjust its sails and ballast stones based on the wind signals coming from all directions, preparing to meet the potentially more complex and unpredictable sea conditions. As night fell, Lynmo climbed the watchtowwer once more. The northern sky was deep and clear, while the southwest was shrouded in its usual mist.</p>
<p>On the sea, the lights of Mo Yuan Pavilion mingled with the starlight, appearing peaceful and steadfast. But Lynn Mo and Mo knew that beneath this tranquility, the undercurrents were growing increasingly turbulent. Frequent unusual movements could be a crisis, but they could also be an opportunity. The key was whether he could see the direction of the tide before the storm truly hit and position his ship in the most advantageous position. He needed more information, more accurate judgment, and a faster pace of growth.</p>
<p>Time seemed to be more pressing than ever before. Chapter 95 Echoes from Afar. The fog over the broken ice zone, the humming from the depths of the bay, and the looming claws of various forces like thunderclouds gathering on the distant horizon did not directly envelop the mo yuan pavilion. But the muffled thunder and the occasional flashes of lightning were enough to make the lookouts tense. Preparations within the mo yuan pavilion were accelerating.</p>
<p>Yet outwardly an orderly facade remained maintained. Seedlings in the plantation thrived under the stabilizers. The cold weather reserve team began joint drills at night and in severe weather conditions, and the warehouses supplies were breaking records daily. However, an invisible pressure had quietly seeped into every discussion and decision-making process within the core circle. The second written exchange with Vera&#x27;s team was completed again via the channel on Conch Island after the agreed interval.</p>
<p>This time the Mayuan Pavilion team added a little more depth to the previous exchange, providing a summary of observations on the graphical tendencies of representing the concepts of cycle or periodicity in different symbol systems and attaching several highly abstracted example symbols. Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s feedback once again demonstrated their profound knowledge. They not only responded to the discussion about cycles, but also provided a brief overview of common energy buffering or isolation structures in ancient ruins, mentioning several recurring symbol combinations in different ruins suspected of being used for damped oscillations or filtering specific frequency energy. This material happens to have a subtle connection to the energy disturbances that Leewi and Shure how have recently been focusing on the potential energy disturbances caused by the big guy wings of liberty energy buffering isolation and filtering of specific frequencies. Leewi studied the new data repeatedly, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>Vera and the others may also be paying attention to similar phenomena. If the combinations of symbols they provided really have practical functions as speculated, it may mean that ancient civilizations have long master methods to deal with specific energy fluctuations and may even have designed them into certain devices or building structures. Such an considered it from another angle. If the things inside the wings of Liberty Fortress are indeed releasing some kind of regular, possibly energy containing fluctuation, then according to this document, the ancients might have used structures represented by these symbols to buffer or isolate to prevent damage to the surrounding environment or the equipment itself. But the Wings of Liberty obviously didn&#x27;t, or perhaps they didn&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the technical blueprints they received were incomplete or that the stonemasons brotherhood provided a flawed version that didn&#x27;t t take stability into account. She and Duodo guessed after all those greyroed men dant looked like philanthropists who would care about the life or death of the users. Then Emmo pondered Vera&#x27;s team had once again provided highly targeted and insightful information as if he could anticipate their focus. Was this a keen academic resonance or some kind of deliberate guidance? He couldn&#x27;t determine for the time being, but the value of the information was undeniable. Combine these symbolic features related to energy buffering and isolation with the common grammar points that Leewi summarized earlier and try to deduce whether we can design a simple device model that can theoretically detect or weaken energy fluctuations at specific frequencies, even if it&#x27;s just on paper.</p>
<p>Lynn mo instructedly weigh require it to be built immediately but we need to figure out the principles and the materials that might be needed at the same time anonymously leak the part of this new data about frequency filtering to our technical intelligence dealers at several key trading points and see if there is similar demand or technology emerging in the market especially through channels related to the stonemasons brotherhood. He wanted to verify whether these academic conjectures provided by Vera&#x27;s team actually corresponded to the technical materials that the Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood was collecting in reality. A few days later, the surveillance of the misty bay of wings of freedom finally yielded a more concrete breakthrough. A seasoned fisherman who had been sponsored by Chanduo for a long time and used fishing for precious silver threadfin bream as a cover ventured close to a secluded headland on the outskirts of the bay on a rare clear day. With the help of a high-powered telescope, he could see part of the fortress&#x27;s outline in the distance.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a castle or fortress in the traditional sense, but rather a low-lying massive industrial complex covered in metal and stone. Most striking was its central section, where a strangely shaped cylindrical structure composed of multiple layers of metal rings and thick pipes stood, estimated to be over 30 m high and about 10 m in diameter. The outer walls of the cylindrical structure were covered with intricate welding marks and additional supports, suggesting it had been hastily assembled. At the time, the structure wasn&#x27;t operational. It stood silently, but numerous figures were busily working around it, seemingly inspecting or adjusting it.</p>
<p>That big cylinder is definitely the thing that makes the buzzing sound. Sure house said with certainty after seeing the sketch drawn based on the fisherman&#x27;s description. With such a complex structure and such a large volume, the energy it consumes must be astonishing. No wonder they hid in Misty Bay. Once this thing is activated, it will be a giant signal lighthouse.</p>
<p>The fisherman also said that he saw some people dressed differently from the tattered clothes of the wings of freedom, loitering around the cylindrical base, pointing and whispering, and he suspected they were members of the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood, Shien Duodo added. But they didn&#x27;t te stay long and quickly left in one of those special speedboats. Around the same time, new and unexpected news also came from the northern icebreaking zone. Dragon Souls deep sea exploration appears to have made some progress. They haven&#x27;t made any public discoveries, but the perimeter security has been significantly tightened, and they&#x27;ve even begun to drive away certain ships that get too close and whose backgrounds are unclear, suspected to be reconnaissance vessel from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood or other forces.</p>
<p>However, even under this tight blockade, a rumor of dubious veracity has begun to circulate in some highly secretive intelligence circles. Reports indicate that Dragon Souls deep sea submersible instead of discovering the imagined ancient architecture or treasure deep within the rift detected an extremely weak but clearly regular acoustic signal. This signal was not naturally formed. Its encoding is extremely complex, seemingly containing a vast amount of information, yet no one could decipher it. Even more disturbingly, when the submersible attempted to record and approach the signal source, it encountered unexplained strong interference, causing some instruments to malfunction and forcing it to surface.</p>
<p>A Dragon Soul technician involved in the operation privately revealed that the interference did not resemble a mechanical malfunction or natural phenomenon, but rather seemed like some kind of proactive defense mechanism. Acoustic signals, active defense. Leeway almost jumped up when he heard the news. This matches our previous speculation that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood might be looking for sound wave related technologies and a frequency filtering mentioned in Vera&#x27;s data. There might be an ancient system that is still partially operational beneath the shattered eye zone using sound waves for communication or control.</p>
<p>The dragon soul has touched its outer defenses. Such an also shocked. If that&#x27;s true, then it&#x27;s not just a static relic. It might still be alive with at least some of its functions still running automatically. This news carries immense weight.</p>
<p>If true, it means that what lies beneath the cracks in the ice flows is far more valuable and dangerous than even the most radical estimates. The technology and potential consequences of a still functioning ancient system are immeasurable. Limo&#x27;s expression was grave. The complexity and danger of the situation, the living ruins in the north, the energy behemoth in the southwest and the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood and the complex Veritim roaming between them, eyeing ancient technology were escalating exponentially. Can the source of this information be confirmed? He asked Chien Duo Duo.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t confirm it completely, but the source of the information is an old informant IV cultivated for many years and who is highly reliable. He swore that he heard it from a Dragon Soul peripheral logistics staff member who had spoken out of turn while drunk and that person was transferred from his post the next day. Shin Duodo replied, &quot;Considering that Dragon Soul suddenly tightened its blockade and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood adjusted its technical search direction. This news is probably somewhat true.&quot; Dot Lynn Emmo walked to the sea chart, his gaze shifting back and forth between the Shattered Ice Zone and the Misty Bay. These two places, one in the north and one in the southwest, were far apart.</p>
<p>Yet, they seemed to be subtly connected by an invisible thread composed of ancient technology and energy anomalies. An MON pavilion was located at a node within the radiation range of this hidden thread. Suspend all further communication with Vera&#x27;s team. Lynn Mo suddenly made the decision. inform them that Mo Yuan Pavilion is temporarily suspending all external academic exchange activities indefinitely due to internal matters.</p>
<p>We express our gratitude for the previous exchange of materials. Everyone was taken aback. Shen Duo asked, &quot;Boss, do you suspect them?&quot; It asked not that we suspect they necessarily have a problem, but with the situation unclear and risks escalating, any additional uncontrolled contact could become a variable. Lynn Emmo explained we need time to digest the existing information and more importantly we need to focus on dealing with the imminent threat once the wings of freedom s cylinder is fully operational it is likely to make a big move the secrets of the shattered ice zone will dragon soul and the stonemason brothers let this go ensure that we are not dragged into any party s scheme or used as a panda he paused then said firmly from now on mo yuan pavilion will be on full alert. All non-essential external communications will be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>Sure, how the guard team will be on level two alert, strengthening the defense and patrols of all key locations. Chi and Duo Duo, the intelligence network will be scaled back, prioritizing the security and monitoring of our own sphere of influence. External information will be collected primarily and all proactive infiltration or guidance activities will be suspended. Leewi Suchian, your research will shift to internal application, focusing on utilizing existing knowledge to enhance our defense, production, and survivability. Yes.</p>
<p>The crowd solemnly accepted the order. The distant echoes were already clearly audible. A storm was brewing, and the ship of Emo Yuan Pavilion had to furl its unnecessary sails, inspect every plank, and prepare ballast stones to meet the real challenge. Lynn Mo&#x27;s gaze swept over every resolute face in the council chamber. After so much quiet development and accumulation, it was time to see if Mo Yuan Pavilion could stand firm like a reef when the storm truly arrived or even find a way to move forward amidst the waves.</p>
<p>The undercurrents on the nautical chart will eventually surface, and they must be fully prepared. Chapter 96, The Silent String. Lynn Mo&#x27;s order to be on full alert and retreat for self-preservation was like a pebble thrown into a calm lake within the Mo Yuan Pavilion. It didn&#x27;t create ripples, but rather a rapid, orderly, and silent chain reaction. This island, this ship named Mo Yuan Pavilion, began to tighten its muscles and tense its nerves in a visible yet silent way.</p>
<p>The most noticeable changes came from the defense front. Sher House suspended almost all non-essential island construction and production tasks, focusing his main efforts on strengthening and testing the defense system. Stricter warning zones were established around the main island and several key subsidiary islands with the addition of numerous concealed lookout points and hidden stakeouts. All ships entering and leaving the shipping lanes, whether owned by the Mo Yuan Pavilion or from foreign trade, the latter having been significantly reduced, were subject to more thorough inspection and guidance, and their routes were redesigned, moving them away from the core area. The storm ships and several main warships completed their final comprehensive overhaul and resupply and are ready to be deployed at any time.</p>
<p>The cold weather reserve has been split up with some elites added to the standing escort and others forming a rapid reaction force equipped with the best gear stationed at several strategic points to ensure they can be deployed from different directions to fight or provide support in the shortest possible time after receiving an alert. Inside the island, the number of guards at key facilities such as warehouses, workshops, command posts, and research workshops, leeway and suanch&#x27;s work areas, has doubled, and a double post system and a regular patrols have been implemented. Sherhow even organized a small-cale exercise simulating enemy infiltration and sabotage to test the guard&#x27;s reaction and the effectiveness of the emergency plan. Although some minor problems were exposed, he was somewhat satisfied with the overall vigilance and response speed. Chindwood&#x27;s intelligence network swiftly shifted from actively gathering intelligence and guiding public opinion to passively receiving information and rigorously filtering it.</p>
<p>All dispatched informants received clear instructions, cease all proactive contact and reconnaissance activities that could arouse suspicion, and switch to silent observation. The focus was on monitoring key target areas. The periphery of the icebreaker zone, the exit of Misty Bay, and major trade route nodes, recording any anomalies, but without intervention. Communication channels with Vera&#x27;s team were unilaterally silenced, and the conchk island transit station entered a receiving not transmitting state. In terms of market transactions, Mo Yuan Pavilion significantly reduced the amount of high-v value or sensitive materials sold to the outside world while quietly increasing its reserve purchases of basic survival supplies, especially storeable food, clean water, medicine, and basic building materials.</p>
<p>Its actions were dispersed and discreet, avoiding price fluctuations or excessive external attention. Chin Duo Duo, like an experienced spider, retracted most of its web, leaving only the most essential strands, quietly sensing every trimmer in its web. Leewi and Sue Chian&#x27;s research direction was also pragmatically adjusted according to Linmo&#x27;s request. Leeway temporarily set aside the profound deduction of the common grammar of the ancient symbolic system and instead focused on two things. First, in collaboration with SHOW, they attempted to design several simple prototype alarm devices for detecting abnormal energy fluctuations or sound waves of specific frequencies using existing semiodic conjectures about energy fluctuations and buffer isolation.</p>
<p>Although limited by materials and processes, the effective detection range and accuracy of these prototype devices were very limited, but they at least provided a theoretical possibility of early warning. Second, they systematically organized all the technical drawings and templates obtained from previous check-ins, transactions, and research on relics, assessed their direct application value in defense, production, and survival, and compiled a list of key materials needed for improvement or mass production. Such Chanchian then conducted a phase summary of the long-term observation data of the environmental stabilizer, confirming its stable positive effects on crop yield increase and local environmental optimization. She began to compile a concise guideline for the construction and management of high efficiency planning areas, systematizing experiences in site selection, layout, stabilizer use, and crop rotation for future use in expanding production or guiding allies. At the same time, she also assisted Leeway in analyzing the potential impacts of abnormal energy fluctuations on ecology and human health from biological and environmental perspectives.</p>
<p>Although empirical data was lacking, at least some theoretical early warning indicators were established. The entire Moan Pavilion seemed to have transformed from adventurous ship sailing the waves into a fortified sea fortress, now on high alert and impregnable. The daily hustle and bustle was replaced by more disciplined busyiness, and a calm and focused atmosphere permeated the air. Everyone knew something big might be about to happen. But long-term training and Lin Mo&#x27;s consistent composure prevented this tension from turning into panic, instead transforming it into more cautious action and closer cooperation.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo himself was like a reclusive chess player, spending most of his time in the reinforced main building&#x27;s command room. The situation map hanging on the wall was updated daily and he carefully analyzed and considered all the external intelligence gathered by Chandu Duo, the defense status reported by Sherhao and the research progress of Leewi and Such Chian. External intelligence continued to arrive intermittently like distant rumbles of thunder in the direction of the shattered ice zone. The Dragon Souls blockade remained tight. Exploration activities seemed to have entered a more covert and technical phase with no more large-scale fleet operations, but the oppressive feeling of an impending storm was growing stronger.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s procurement list had added items such as high precision inertial navigation units and geomagnetic field anomaly recorders, indicating that their goals were becoming increasingly clear and their technical preparations increasingly professional. In the misty bay of the southwest, the wings of Liberty&#x27;s fortress remained shrouded in thick fog. But the frequency of the low humming sound seemed to be slowly increasing and its duration was trending towards longer. Reconnaissance speedboats on the perimeter reported that during the recent episodes of the hum, fish in the nearby waters exhibited brief unnatural gatherings or scattering and some sensitive navigation compasses showed slight brief fluctuations in their needles. These signs all indicated that the influence of the cylinder device was gradually spilling over.</p>
<p>What concerned Linmo most was a seemingly unrelated message from the eastern seas. A fleet that regularly hunted large sea monsters on the edge of the Cape of Storms reported several extremely unusual incidents of collective sea monster agitation. Recently, several large sea monsters with different habits, and even natural enemies would suddenly gather in specific areas, behave wildly, attack each other, and even actively ram ships before inexplicably dispersing within a short period, leaving behind large areas of bloodstained seawater and wreckage. This phenomenon was extremely rare in the past, but it had occurred three times in the past month. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s been subjected to some kind of strong but unconventional stimulus or drive.</p>
<p>Sue Chanchian analyzed after hearing the news. It could be underwater geological activity or it could be some kind of energy field or pheromone interference that we don&#x27;t yet understand if it&#x27;s related to the wings of freedom device or something beneath the ice flows. She didn&#x27;t continue but her anxiety was palpable. The world was becoming increasingly uneasy, and the source of this unease seemed to be pointing to the ancient relics that were gradually surfacing. Time passed in silent vigilance.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan Pavilion was like a fully drawn bow, the string taught, the arrow poised, but not yet released. Lyn Mo waited, waiting for a clearer signal, waiting for a gap in the situation to appear, or waiting for the inevitable collision to finally arrive. He stood by the command room window, gazing at the well-trained guards and an orderly island outside. The power that had been painstakingly accumulated had now transformed into tangible barriers and sharp blades. But the impending storm might far surpass anything seen before.</p>
<p>How much tension could this silent string withstand? And when would it unleash that decisive hum? As dusk settles where the sea meets the sky, the lights of Man Pavilion gradually illuminate the scene. Standing like a silent yet resolute island in this increasingly uneasy world. The strings are taught, awaiting the wind. Chapter 97. The strings strikes and the wind rises.</p>
<p>The silent vigilance of Mayu pavilion was like a deep sea current, seemingly calm on the surface, yet surging with immense energy and focus within. More than 10 days passed in this highly tense yet unusually orderly state. News from the outside world like filtered sea breezes seeped into this silent fortress, carrying with it the distant scent of gunpowder and the coldness of metal. The rumbling thunder from the direction of the ice shards finally echoed more clearly. Chien Duo Duo obtained a fragmented but incredibly informative intelligence summary through an extremely secretive and costly channel.</p>
<p>This summary appeared to originate from a technician who had participated in the early exploration program of Dragon Soul, but left due to ideological differences or conflicts of interest. The summary revealed that Dragon Souls Deep Sea Submersible not only detected regular acoustic signals, but also discovered and successfully retrieved a sample of a non-naturally formed composite structure from the ice rock mixture on the sidewall of a fissure. The sample description is vague, but it mentions that its material is not any known metal or rock and it possesses excellent energy conductivity and memory properties. It can slowly recover its original shape after being deformed under pressure. More importantly, the sample surface is etched with resonance patterns that partially match the frequencies of acoustic signals received deep within the fissures.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls preliminary analysis suggests that this sample is likely a fragment or node of a larger structure and its patterns could be either antennas receiving specific commands or anchor points maintaining the stability of the local energy field. They really did dig something out from below. Leeway&#x27;s breathing quickened as he looked at the summary translated and compiled by Chien Duo Duo. The resonant pattern energy anchor points are very likely of the same origin as the symbols on our stone slab. Beneath the ice shards, there&#x27;s probably a large scale ancient complex, some of which are still operational.</p>
<p>The intelligence summary also mentioned that after obtaining the samples, the acoustic signals deep within the fiser experienced a brief but violent disturbance accompanied by a smallcale non-earquake induced cavity collapse sound within the ice layer. Dragon Souls monitoring equipment recorded the instantaneous ultra- low frequency pulses causing damage to some precision instruments. Subsequently, the acoustic signals became weak and unstable, forcing the exploration operation to transition to a more cautious long-term monitoring and sample analysis phase. The active defense mechanism has been triggered. Lynn Mo concluded the dragon soul got the key, but it also alerted the watchdog.</p>
<p>The thing below reacted very quickly. Almost simultaneously, the buzzing behemoth in the southwestern misty bay seemed to have completed a phase of adjustment and began to reveal its fangs more clearly. The previous low intermittent hum gradually evolved into a more penetrating rhythmic pulsating roar. Every 6 to 8 hours, the roar would occur precisely, lasting for about 15 minutes like the slow beating of a giant heart. When the roar occurred, not only did the cloud disturbances and faint flashes of lightning over the bay become more frequent and clear, but even dozens of nautical miles away, the distinct rhythmic vibrations could be detected with simple hydrophones.</p>
<p>Even more disturbingly, during the two most recent pulse booms, monitoring points set up at a greater distance by Moyuan Pavilion to listen to ambient background noise recorded an extremely weak modulation signal that seemed to be synchronized with the boom pulses. This signal was mixed in with a complex ocean background noise and was difficult to analyze. But Leeway initially judged that it was likely a carrier signal. That is the boom might not just be a simple sound wave or energy release but was also actively sending out some kind of modulated signal carrying information. Is it speaking or summoning something? Felt sure how&#x27;s concerns were more direct.</p>
<p>Regardless of what it&#x27;s sending, this regular signal with its distinct energy characteristics is like a torch in the dark. The remnants of the wings of freedom are probably hiding in Misty Bay, not just to conceal themselves, but also to use the complex environment there is covered to conduct this kind of signal broadcasting. Their goal is definitely not limited to holding out in one place. Just as the key in the north and the broadcast in the southwest were gripping everyone&#x27;s attention, new activity emerged from the temporarily silent scholar channel. Vera&#x27;s team ship hadn&#x27;t left, remaining unusually quiet in the public anchorage outside the Mo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>However, the transit station on Conch Island received an insigned tightly sealed letter addressed to the person in charge of Mo Yuan Pavilion. The letter wasn&#x27;t sent through the usual exchange channels, but was delivered directly by a stranger who called himself a wandering messenger who dropped it off and left. The letter was very short, consisting of only two sentences written in an elegant variant of archaic script. The sound of ice breaking has already begun, and the sea of fog is about to boil. Knowledge knows no bounds, but storms have eyes.</p>
<p>Those who observe quietly may see the opportunity for dragons and snakes to rise from the land. If there is any glimmer of light to be found at midnight, 3 days from now at the old place, let the starlight be the signal. The document wasn&#x27;t signed, but the wording and implications clearly indicated it came from Ver&#x27;s team. They were not only aware of the unusual activity in the icebreaker zone in Misty Bay, but also seemed to foresee even greater chaos, dragon and snake rising from the land. They extended an olive branch of cooperation once again, but this time it hinted at a more proactive stance of observation or even intervention and proposed a specific time and place.</p>
<p>The old place likely refers to Conk Island in a mysterious method of communication, a spark as a signal. They really have been watching us do frowned. They even knew when we were silent and they used a more covert way to send a message directly. Spark as signal sounds like some kind of optical signal. What are they trying to do? Are they trying to get us to join them in the chaos and get a share of the spoils? Or do they have some crucial information and want to team up with us? Sure, how asked cautiously.</p>
<p>Showing ourselves at this time is too risky. Leewi eyes was moved by the line. Knowledge knows no bounds, but storms have eyes in the letter. They may believe that this storm caused by ancient relics is a key window to gain deeper knowledge, but they also acknowledge that the risks are huge. So they want to find reliable allies to share the glimmer of light.</p>
<p>Such Chian said softly. They mentioned those who observe silently may witness the opportunity for dragons and snakes to rise from the land. Is this implying that if we just passively wait, we might miss important turning points or be swallowed up by a sudden giant wave? Perhaps proactive, limited observation and preparation are the way to deal with the storm. All eyes were fixed on Lyno. The exploration in the north had achieved a breakthrough, but triggered a counterattack.</p>
<p>The device in the southwest began broadcasting regularly, and a mysterious group of scholars extended an invitation tinged with adventure. The silent strings had been plucked by forces from different directions, emitting a low, clear vado. The wind had begun to blow. Lynn Emo silently stared at the brief letter, then glanced at the constantly updated situation map on the wall. Mo Yuan Pavilion was like a temporarily calm spot in the eye of a storm, but the surrounding vortex was rapidly closing in.</p>
<p>Continuing to remain completely silent and protect themselves might avoid the initial impact. But it could also mean missing the opportunity to learn the truth, acquire key resources, or even influence the course of the situation. Completely heeding Vera&#x27;s suggestion and recklessly intervening would undoubtedly plunge themselves into an unknown vortex. He needs a middle way. A way that allows him to acquire information and exert influence while minimizing risk.</p>
<p>No direct meeting. Lynn, Emo finally spoke, his voice steady and firm. She and Duo Duo prepare an encrypted reply. The content is as follows. The sparks are visible, but boats cannot reach it.</p>
<p>A mirror can be set up at the old place to observe the stars from one direction only. If the stars are willing, they can reflect a cloud map or two. The time limit remains unchanged. He looked at the slightly confused group and explained, &quot;We on one t send anyone.&quot; We ll set up a hidden observation point on Conch Island that can only receive specific light signals. Spark if Vera and the others appear as scheduled and send out their signals.</p>
<p>We ll observe their action from a distance to see what they want to do and who they want to contact. At the same time, we ll hint to them that if they re willing to share key information about the current situation, cloud atlas, we can consider establishing a one-way controllable information reception channel, mirror stargazing. This is an extreme form of caution and probing. It involves remaining unseen, making no promises, observing without revealing anything, and using a vague exchange condition to entice the other party to first disclose some valuable intelligence. What if they agree and actually provide valuable information? Chen Duo Duo asked, &quot;That proves they&#x27;re indeed sincere in their willingness to cooperate and that we have the intelligence we need.</p>
<p>We can decide whether to conduct further extremely limited and absolutely secure written exchanges based on the value of the information, but it will absolutely not involve any joint operations.&quot; Lynmo said, &quot;If they disagree or if the so-called spark is just bait, then we will remain silent and strengthen our defenses.&quot; With the plan finalized, everyone immediately split up to prepare. Chandu Duo was responsible for encrypted replies and arranging the receiving point on Conch Island. Shirha was responsible for selecting the most elite reconnaissance personnel to secretly go to the nearby waters to provide support and leeway and Sue Chian assisted in designing the optical observation and signal identification schemes required for mirror stargazing. The strings of Mo Yuan Pavilion remain taut, but fingertips have already lightly touched them, ready to pluck their own calm and astute notes amidst the rustling winds and howling winds. The strings pluck, the wind rises, and the true test seems to be quietly approaching between the midnight starlight and the silent mirror.</p>
<p>Chapter 98. Peeping at the stars at midnight. The agreed upon 3-day deadline arrived quietly beneath the surface of a high level of vigilance, yet an unusually calm atmosphere both inside and outside the Mo Yuan Pavilion. The daytime hustle and bustle faded away, and night, as dark as ink, spread across the sea and sky. The stars were sparse, and the crescent moon was hidden behind thin clouds, making it the perfect time to carry out clandestine activities.</p>
<p>Conchk Island. This unassuming little island appears even more tranquil under the cover of night. Beneath a steep cliff on the island&#x27;s north side, eroded by the sea, lies a hidden recess. Its entrance narrow, yet revealing a hidden world within. Originally an emergency hiding place set up by Chen Duodu years ago, it has now been temporarily converted into a one-way observation station.</p>
<p>The interior of the recess had been simply cleaned and an inconspicuous viewing hole was carved into the open sea. Its inner wall lined with lightabsorbing black velvet. Behind the viewing hole mounted a long telescope hastily modified by Leeway. This telescope centered on a highquality crystal lens obtained through a signin event incorporated several sets of precise gears and rails allowing for fine-tuning of the observation angle without moving the telescope itself and possessed some night vision enhancement capabilities utilizing a photosensitive coating sensitive to faint starlight. The eyepiece of the telescope was connected to a complex light blocking tube ensuring that not a single ray of light leaked out.</p>
<p>The observation mission was led by two elite guards personally selected by Sherh How, cenamed Night Owl and Raven. Both were experienced reconnaissance specialists, skilled in infiltration and observation and utterly loyal to the Mo Yuan pavilion. 6 hours in advance, they secretly infiltrated the cave, carrying sufficient water and rations, as well as a simple signal transmission device connecting to a speedboat several miles away. hidden in a reef area via a highly concealed waterproof signal line buried in a rock crevice on the speedboat. A dedicated person was responsible for translating the received signals in real time and transmitting them back to the main island.</p>
<p>Linmo Sherha Chandu Duo Leewi and Su Chian gathered in the main island&#x27;s command room awaiting news. On the walls of the command room, a detailed nautical chart of the area surrounding Conch Island was enlarged and hung, marking known reefs, ocean currents, and possible observation points. A copy of Vera&#x27;s letter and a draft of her encrypted reply lay open on the table. The atmosphere was solemn and heavy. Time ticked by, and midnight was fast approaching.</p>
<p>The only sounds in the command room were a scratching of charcoal pencils across paper and the occasional hush conversations. Such Chian gently stroked the sea shell bracelet on her wrist while Leeway repeatedly examined several drafts on the table concerning possible forms of optical signal encoding. Lynn Immo sat upright in the main seat. His gaze calmly fixed on the small representing Conchk Island on the nautical chart, his fingers unconsciously tapping a rhythmic beat on the back of his chair. &quot;It&#x27;s exactly midnight.&quot; Sherhow looked at the water clock and announced the time in a low voice.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he finished speaking, the signal receiver connected to the speedboat made a slight click and then the green light indicating signal access lit up. The guard in charge of communications quickly handed the headset to Lynn Mo. A slight static noise came through the headphones, followed by Night Owl&#x27;s extremely low but exceptionally clear voice coming through the signal cable. Main island. This is Night Owl.</p>
<p>Midnight. No abnormalities on the sea. Observation scope in place. Clear view. No light source detected.</p>
<p>Continued to observe, Lynn Mo replied briefly. About 15 minutes passed. Just when everyone thought Vera&#x27;s team might not appear or that spark as a signal had another meaning, Night Owl&#x27;s voice rang out again with a hint of tension that was barely perceptible. Main island attention. At the 11:00 position, about three nautical miles away, there&#x27;s a faint flash on the sea.</p>
<p>The flashes are irregularly spaced, but there seems to be a repeating pattern being recorded. Everyone in the command room perked up. Leeway immediately went to the table, picked up paper and pen, and prepared to record the signal pattern. Chin Duo Duo quickly marked a point at the 11:00 position on the nautical chart. The flashing pattern is initially identified.</p>
<p>Short, short, long, short, long, long. Repeating once every 3 seconds and then pausing. Bial&#x27;s voice calmly reported the observation results. Leewi quickly jotted down on the paper a fragment representing RU in Morse code, but not entirely standard. He whispered, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t seem like a standard communication code.</p>
<p>It might be a custom identification signal.&quot; Night Owl continued reporting. The flashes have stopped. A ship has appeared on the sea. Its outline is Vera&#x27;s threemasted sailing ship slowly moving towards the designated reef area southeast of Conch Island. There are no lights on the ship, only faintly visible by starlight and the reflection of the sea is moving very slowly.</p>
<p>Are there any other signs of activity on the ship? Lyn Mo asked. Nothing yet. The sailboat has anchored outside the reef area. A small boat with about three people has been launched and is paddling towards the beach on the southeast side of the island. The small boat has no lights on.</p>
<p>Continue to monitor the movement of the small boats and pay attention to any abnormalities on the sailboats and other sea areas, Lin Mo instructed. Clear. The next half hour was a long wait and meticulous observation. After the three people on the small boat landed, they seem to be busy with something on the beach, but due to the angle and the darkness, the observation mirror in the recess could not see the details clearly. Night Owl and Raven could only judge their presence by the occasional blurry figures and extremely faint sounds of tools.</p>
<p>What are they setting up? Could it be that the so-called spark isn&#x27;t launched from the ship, but from the island? Chen Duo Duo guessed. Lee Wei eyes focused on the signal pattern. Although the flashing signals they emitted were not standard, it was clearly a conscious act of communication. Who were they trying to contact besides us? Could it be anyone else? Just then, Night Owl&#x27;s voice rang out again, tinged with obvious surprise. Main island, attention.</p>
<p>A light is rising from the direction of the beach. It&#x27;s not an open flame, but a cold light. The color is bluish white. The brightness is stable, and it&#x27;s slowly rising like some kind of signal lantern. It&#x27;s about 3 m high.</p>
<p>The light is flashing in a specific rhythm. The rhythm is long, short, short, long, short. Unlike the previous flashing pattern on the sea, new light signal, Vera&#x27;s team did indeed establish a signal point on the island. Who are they sending signals to? In the air or in other directions at sea? Sukiangyang Wandiff. Raven reporting.</p>
<p>Another slightly deeper voice cut in on the communication. Raven was using another telescope to observe the sea in other directions. Watch the two:00 position about five nautical miles away. There is a faint reflective object moving on the sea. It is moving very fast.</p>
<p>It is approaching. The outline is of a small speedboat and the style is very similar to the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood s speciallymade speedboat mentioned in the previous intelligence. The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood. They come after all. The atmosphere in the command room instantly tensed.</p>
<p>Vera&#x27;s team sent a signal attracting the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood ship. Was this a trap or a secret contact that all three parties were aware of? Night Owl, Raven, maintain absolute silence. Observe only and record all details that Lynn and Mo voice remain calm. Pay attention to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood speedboat movements and their methods of contact with Ver team. Dot.</p>
<p>Clear. What followed completely exceeded Emo Yuinga&#x27;s expectations. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood speedboat did not approach Conch Island directly, but slowed down about a nautical mile away and began to slowly circle around a fixed point. At the same time, a highly concentrated dark red thin beam of light shone from the bow of the speedboat like a blood red line shooting straight towards the approximate direction of the bluish white signal lantern on the island&#x27;s beach. A laser or was some kind of highly directional signal light? Leeway exclaimed in a low voice.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re using this method for directional communication. The red and blue lights did not intersect in the night sky, but they clearly constituted a kind of dialogue that could take place without close proximity. The entire process lasted less than 5 minutes. The red light went out first, and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood speedboat immediately changed direction and sped away at an even higher speed, quickly disappearing into the night shrouded sea. Moments later, the bluish white lanterns on the beach also went out.</p>
<p>Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s small boat quickly reappeared and rode back to their sailboat. The sailboat weighed anchor and also silently sailed away in a different direction from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood speedboat. Conchk Island returned to its deathly silence as if everything that had just happened was merely an illusion. Night Owl Raven, after confirming the target has completely left, proceed with caution. Be sure to clean up any traces, Lynn.</p>
<p>Mo ordered. Yes. Communications were temporarily cut off. Silence filled the command room, broken only by the slightly heavy breathing of the crew. Vera and the others actually contacted the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood directly in this way.</p>
<p>Chin Duo duo exclaimed incredulously. Didn&#x27;t they say they had competition and conflicts with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood? This looks more like a secret rendevu. Perhaps the conflict is real, but in some situations, cooperation is also necessary,&quot; Linimo said slowly. &quot;They used the mirror we provided to let us see firsthand their contact with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Was this a demonstration or a sign of honesty? Or are they trying to send us some kind of message that they have the ability to speak directly with that mysterious organization?&quot; The two signals they rescending along with the red light from the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood are definitely exchanging information that Leeway frowned.</p>
<p>But what is it? Is it about the shattered eyeone or the misty bay or some other ruins we dy know about? Suchian said worriedly. Does the fact that they showed us these things mean that what&#x27;s going to happen next might affect us? Are they giving us a heads up or trying to drag us into this? Sure. How clenched his fist? Regardless of their purpose, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is entangled with the remnants of the Wings of Liberty. And now Vera&#x27;s team is also secretly contacting the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. This is a very murky situation.</p>
<p>We must be even more careful. Lynamo stood up and walked to the nautical chart, his gaze deep. Peering at the stars at midnight didn&#x27;t yield clear answers, but rather a more elusive star map and interwoven shadows. Vera&#x27;s team had demonstrated their channels and capabilities, while the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood had revealed their more clearly defined technological fangs. The Mo Yuan Pavilion as a silent observer was safe, but might also be thus isolated from the true flow of information and the decision-making circle.</p>
<p>Record everything observed tonight in detail and archive it. Linmo turnaround is tone firm. At the same time, activate the second contingency plan. She and Duo Duo sent a new encrypted message to Ver ship through the backup secure channel. The message should contain only two words.</p>
<p>Observe no comments, no demands. Doc, he paused, his gaze sweeping over the crowd. They told us to look, so we looked. Next, we need to see what they do and also see which way the wind will blow in the icebreaker zone and the Misty Bay. Continue to strengthen our vigilance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lewi, Su Chian, concentrate on trying to decipher the possible meaning of the signal patterns we saw tonight from all the information we have. Even if it&#x27;s just a guess, we need more pieces of the puzzle to understand this game. The midnight sparks and mirrors have faded, but the reflections and preparations they evoked have only just begun. Mo Yuan Pavilion remains on the edge of the storm, but its observing eyes have become even sharper before the true waves crash against the shore. Every ripple of information deserves careful capture and weighing.</p>
<p>Chapter 99. Cipher letters. The words observed vanished silently from the other end of the encrypted channel like a pebble thrown into a deep pool. Mo Yuan Pavilion received no reply from Vera&#x27;s team and a threemasted sailing ship completely disappeared from the surrounding waters after the midnight meeting as if it had never existed. However, the starlight and red glow outside Conch Island that night were etched into the minds of Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s core members like a brand, bringing more doubts than answers.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, Mo Yuan Pavilion maintained a state of full alert that was outwardly relaxed but inwardly tense. But the focus of its internal work quietly shifted towards information deciphering and situation analysis. Leewi and Su Chian devoted almost all their energy to analyzing the signal patterns they observed that night. They split up. Leewi was responsible for deciphering the information encoding that the light signals might carry while Such Chian using her sense of rhythm tried to understand the possible emotional or intentional connections between different signal patterns.</p>
<p>Leeway encountered enormous difficulties in his work. Whether it was the irregular flashes of light initially emitted by Vera&#x27;s team on the sea, the different flickering rhythm of the lanterns on the island, or the modulation information possibly implied by the dark redirectional beam of light from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood speedboat. None of these had a known code book or matching system. He tried various classic encoding methods such as simplified Morse code, binary positional encoding, and even some variations of ancient military codes for matching, but all he got were a jumbled mess of meaningless combinations of letters or numbers. They might be using a completely custom-designed or even one-time use cryptographic system, Leewei reported to Lynn Mo, rubbing his throbbing temples.</p>
<p>or those light signals themselves dant t directly correspond to text information but are simplified symbols for identity recognition status confirmation or action instructions that like pyro flag signals or military hand signals but more complex such progress was equally slow and subjective the flashes on the sea gave me a feeling of probing and uncertainty with a hint of urgency the lanterns on the island were more stable and expectant as if waiting for a response The red light from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was very cold and hard and direct with almost no emotional fluctuations. It was purely information transmission or conditional confirmation. She described her perception. But this feeling was too vague to deduce any specific content. Although their direct decryption failed, their work wasn&#x27;t entirely fruitless.</p>
<p>Through repeated comparisons and modeling, Leewayi deduced that Vera&#x27;s team might possess a fairly sophisticated technical solution for short-range optical cover communication, far exceeding the current capabilities of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. Such an perception at least confirmed that the collaboration between Vera&#x27;s team and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was not seamless, but rather a highly guarded temporary communication based on certain preconditions. Just when a signal research was at a standstill, Chindwood was intelligence network sent more specific information from another unexpected direction which might be related to the meeting that night. An informant who had been lurking in the eastern reef black market, a large floating market located in the buffer zone between several major powers known for trading gray goods and information, managed to extract some fragmented information from a drunken down on his luck captain who claimed to have once provided transportation services for the outer perimeter of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood by paying a high price. According to the captain&#x27;s boast, about 10 days earlier, he had been ordered to pilot a disguised cargo ship, transporting a batch of tightly sealed wooden crates to a desolate area in the northwest.</p>
<p>The recipient was a speedboat that was unmarked, but looked very powerful. Its characteristics resembled those of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. During the handover, he overheard the people on the speedboat in a greyroed, a distinctive stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood attire, escorting a ship whispering about things like the echoes and the ice flow are getting clearer. The resonance test of the and the delivery of the backup resonator must be done discreetly and on time. After the handover, the grey rogue man gave the people on the speedboat a small metal tube, saying it contains some kind of frequency correction parameters and contingency plan for contact in the fog sea.</p>
<p>The informant repeated the drunken captain&#x27;s words. The captain said that the grey rogue man instructed that the items must be delivered to friends on the other side of the fog sea before the next title window and also said that the structure on the other side has unstable resonance and needs external calibration. The echoes and keys of the ice crushed area. The structures and resonant instability of the fog shrouded sea. And what about frequency correction and contact contingency plans? These fragmented words like a flash of lightning instantly connected many scattered points.</p>
<p>Leeway suddenly stood up and said excitedly, &quot;I understand. The acoustic signal emitted by the ancient facility below the ice shards is an echo. The sample that Dragon Soul found might be the key or node that can resonate with it. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood has been collecting related technologies and they may have known this for a long time or even have other keys or resonators.&quot; Such Chian also realized in the Misty Bay that large cylinder belonging to the remnants of the Wings of Liberty is the construct they built. The pulsed roar it emits is probably some kind of resonance.</p>
<p>But this resonance is unstable. So the Brotherhood of Stonemasons needs to provide frequency correction parameters for calibration. Vera&#x27;s team at the meeting on Conch Island that night might have been the middleman, a witness, or even one of the technology providers. They were assisting the brotherhood of stonemasons in some kind of technical handover or coordination with the remnants of the wings of liberty. Shindu Duo continued his analysis before the next title window.</p>
<p>The tides affect ocean currents and seawater pressure which may also affect the propagation of sound waves in the water or the operational status of certain facilities. This may be a time point they have set for action. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood will send the calibration parameters to the wings of freedom to ensure that their construct can operate stably at a specific time or achieve a certain effect. Lynn Emo listened to everyone&#x27;s analysis, his gaze sharp. The outline gradually became clear.</p>
<p>The ancient acoustic system of the shattered eye zone, the exploration of the dragon soul, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s pursuit of technology, the energy device of the remnants of the wings of freedom, and Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s mysterious bridge. All of this seemed to revolve around the keywords sound, frequency, resonance, and control. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood attempted to utilize ancient technology, perhaps to control or activate something. The remnants of the Wings of Liberty may have been their chosen testing ground or tool. Vera&#x27;s team is well-versed in this and may have had contact with both sides, their motives unclear.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul was an unexpected intruder, but they also obtained the crucial key. So, what did the Stonemasons Brotherhood ultimately intend to do with that construct? Was the calibrated resonance aimed at the icebreaking zone or was it for some other purpose? Does that drunk captain remember the approximate tide window time? Lynn Emmo asked Chi Duo Duo. Chandu Duo shook his head. He was vague. I only remember that it was about 10 days later, but the calculation of the title cycle at C requires a specific location.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know the specific location and reference point they agreed on, so we can&#x27;t make an accurate calculation. 10 days is not a long time. Continue to dig up all information about title windows, frequency correction, and constructs at all costs, Linmo ordered. At the same time, closely monitor any unusual movement to the exit of Misty Bay and the remnants of the Wings of Freedom, especially the intensity and duration of the next pulse roar, and whether there are any other accompanying phenomena. Leeway Su Chanchian based on this new approach re-examine all the data we have on energy fluctuations acoustic signals and ancient symbols focusing on finding parts that may be related to resonance calibration and control.</p>
<p>He paused then looked at everyone. If our predictions are correct then something big is likely to happen in Misty Bay and the icebreaker zone soon. We may not be able to stop it but we must see it clearly and be prepared. Although the letter wasn&#x27;t delivered directly, the coded message had already subtly emerged through fragmented information. A vast net woven from sound waves, energy, ancient technology, and the ambitions of various factions was quietly unfolding in this sea.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan Pavilion was situated on the edge of this net, needing not only to avoid being drawn in, but also to try to discern its intricacies and even find a thread that could be used. A storm is approaching, and this storm may not originate from nature, but rather from the echoes of the deep sea and a resonance of human activity. Chapter 100. The window will open. From the red glow of stars glimpsed at midnight on Conk Island to the fragmented drunken tales circulated through the East Reef black market, the scattered information pieced together and deduced repeatedly by Lee Wayi, Sue Chanchian, and Shi and Dodu Oo, gradually sketched out an unsettling picture, an unknown plan with tidal windows as its time limit, connecting the ancient echoes of the icebreaker zone, the artificial resonance of the wings of freedom, and the technical calibration of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was like the shadow of a deep sea monster slowly approaching beneath the calm surface of the sea.</p>
<p>The response from Mo Yuan Pavilion has thus entered a new phase. Simply remaining silent and on guard is no longer sufficient. More targeted preparations must be made within the limited time available. Linmo first adjusted the allocation of internal resources. He approved Leewi&#x27;s request to use a batch of reserved rare metals and precision machining tools to urgently manufacture several improved prototypes of the wideband acoustic wave detector and recorder.</p>
<p>These prototypes were designed based on Leeway&#x27;s conjecture about ancient energy symbols and the energy buffer provided by Vera&#x27;s team. Although they could not actively emit or resolve complex signals, they could passively receive and record anomalous sound waves and vibrations in the environment with higher sensitivity and a wider frequency range, especially those signals that might have regularity or modulation characteristics. Such an assisted in optimizing the detector&#x27;s anti-inference structure and environmental adaptability to ensure they could operate stably under different sea conditions. Our goal is to have sharper ears, not louder voices. Lynn Emmo emphasized the leeway.</p>
<p>Understanding what those resonances and echoes are actually saying or at least recording their patterns of change is crucial for us to assess the situation. Dot. Sure. How adjusted is training focus accordingly. The cold weather reserve team was reorganized and incorporated adaptive training to cope with strong sound waves or vibration interference.</p>
<p>Team members were required to complete communication, coordination, and basic operational tasks in simulated high-intensity noise and vibration environments created by simple equipment, honing their responsiveness and teamwork when their senses were severely disrupted. Simultaneously, Sherhow began developing multiple emergency evacuation and shelter plans for sudden crises from different directions, north, southwest, and even potentially other directions at sea, and organized several small-cale drills. Chindwood&#x27;s intelligence network was like a newlywoven net with a more focused approach. Surveillance of Misty Bay was elevated to the highest priority. In addition to existing remote observation points, Chin Duo Duo spared no expense in bribing the captain of small supply ship that regularly entered and exited the bay to deliver fresh fruits and vegetables to the fortress&#x27;s lower ranking personnel.</p>
<p>This captain, timid but greedy, promised to record as much as possible any unusual sounds from within the fortress, the atmosphere surrounding personnel movements, and subtle changes in the appearance of a large cylinder during each trip, transmitting this information through a pre-planned covert method. Direct reconnaissance of the eyeshard area was impossible due to Dragon Souls tight blockade and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s high level of expertise. Chiandu Duo instead intensified his monitoring of the flow of technical personnel and a market for rare resources. He needed to know besides those already known which other individuals or forces were secretly collecting technologies and resources related to acoustic detection, frequency control, and deep sea engineering. This might reveal how many other players were lurking behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Time slipped away amidst the intensive preparations. Every day, subtle changes were taking place in the voices coming from the southwest and the north. As predicted, the pulsating roar of the misty bay began to show signs of calibration. According to a newly developed report from the inside captain, the roar had briefly ceased for most of the day about 5 days ago. And when it resumed, its tone seemed to have become pure and stable with a previously faint teeth grinding metallic highfrequency noise almost completely gone.</p>
<p>The intervals of the roar remained regular, but the duration of each roar began to show regular slight adjustments based on the tidal cycle. The roar would last slightly longer by a few minutes before and after high tide, and its intensity also seemed to increase imperceptibly. The weak carrier signal accompanying the roar recorded by peripheral monitoring points also showed more complex and regular modulation characteristics. They retuning it like tuning a musical instrument. at leeway analyzed the latest recorded data.</p>
<p>The frequency correction parameters provided by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood should have been used by now. The target frequency of that thing is likely related to some natural change caused by tidal forces such as seawater pressure or specific ocean currents. The area around the shattered ice was relatively quiet. Dragon Souls exploration activities seemed to have entered a deeper period of silence. The outer perimeter remains sealed off, but no new noteworthy actions were reported.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s procurement list had added items such as highdensity energy batteries and multisspectral signal shielding materials, seemingly indicating preparations for some kind of infiltration or protection. Just 3 days before the expected date of the title window, an unexpected incident occurred. The bribe supply ship captain upon his most recent entry into a misty bay brought out a flat palmsized metal sheet wrapped in tarpollen. The sheet had irregular edges as if cut or broken off from a larger component, and its surface was covered with burn marks and twisting. However, on its relatively flat side, several extremely faint yet unusually neat engravings were faintly visible.</p>
<p>The captain claimed that he had stumbled upon a metal sheet in a pile of scrap awaiting disposal on the edge of the fortress and thought the pattern was a bit strange, so he secretly hid it. He dared not linger and, as agreed, sent the item out along with routine intelligence. The metal sheet was immediately delivered to Leeway. After careful cleaning, the engravings were revealed two nested extremely smooth arc patterns with several tiny dot-like depressions adorning the inner side of the patterns. This is a style known to Wings of Liberty or the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, Lewi said confidently after examining it carefully.</p>
<p>The smoothness and precision of the texture even surpasses the sleeping ridge rubbing style provided by Various team. It has closer to the cold geometric feel of our hemlock island slate, but with an added strange flowing charm. He tried to observe the cross-section of the engraving with a high-powered magnifying glass. The processing technique is also extremely advanced. It doesn&#x27;t te seem like it was handcarved, but more like it was formed in one piece.</p>
<p>After sensing it, Sue Chan frowns slightly. It feels very empty. Unlike our stone slab, which has a clear sense of instruction or framework, it doesn&#x27;t have the meaning of description or record like other symbols. It&#x27;s more like a marker or a purely abstract representation of an interface. Those two arcs give me the feeling of loop and inclusiveness, but they are very restrained.</p>
<p>This unexpectedly acquired metal fragment, like a signature from an unknown third party, suddenly appeared in the rubble of the Liberty Wings fortress. Where did it come from? Was it an original component of the great cylindrical structure? Or an antique mixed in with the technical materials provided by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood? Or perhaps some other force had already established a connection with the remnants of Liberty Wings through unknown means. On top of the mystery, another mystery arises. Lynn Mo listened carefully to the report about the metal sheet, remaining silent for a long time. The complexity of the situation had once again exceeded his expectations, but he did not panic.</p>
<p>Instead, he became even calmer. Trace the patterns on the metal sheet and compare them with the symbol library, but don&#x27;t delve into it for now. Linmo instructed. The primary task at present remains dealing with the title window. All prototype detectors must complete their final debugging before sunset tomorrow.</p>
<p>Shh will arrange the most reliable teams to secretly take the equipment to the designated observation points. Two points in the north to focus on monitoring any abnormal sound waves that may come from the direction of the ice flow area. Three points in the southwest forming an arc around the exit of the Misty Bay to record the detailed parameter changes of the pulse roar. All monitoring equipment on the main island and the affiliated islands will be activated and put into continuous recording mode. He looked at everyone, his tone calm, yet carrying an undeniable authority.</p>
<p>The window is about to open. We cannot predict what will rush out, but we must see its outline and hear its sound. Pass down the order. All members of the Mayuen Pavilion, enter level one silence and standby status. Do not emit any signals or lights that may attract attention unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>We must stand there silently like a reef, observing, recording, and waiting. Yes. The order was swiftly relayed. The entire island of Mauuan Pavilion fell into a final pre- battle silence. Lights were controlled, noise was prohibited, and even training exercises were switched to completely silent indoor sessions.</p>
<p>Everyone could feel the unusual tense atmosphere, a sense of impending doom. Leewi and Sue Chian were conducting final checks in the laboratory. Shir how was checking the equipment and routes of each observation team and Sh and Duo Duo was guarding his communications room to ensure that all intelligence lines were unobstructed. Lynn and Mo climbed alone to the top of the reinforced command platform and gazed into the distance. Dusk was falling and the sea and sky stretched into a vast expanse of gray.</p>
<p>The northern sky seemed even darker than usual while the southwest remained shrouded in its usual mist. The wind seemed to have stopped and the sea surface had an unusual smoothness. Was this the calm before the storm or the suffocating stillness before a towering wave? The window is about to open. Mo Yuan Pavilion has opened every ear it can and tightened every nerve it can mobilize. They do not seek to actively intervene in this movement jointly played by ancient echoes and human ambition.</p>
<p>But they must become the most clear-headed listeners, recording the rise and fall and changes of every note. This silent listening is itself a power and also a choice. When the force of the tides reaches its peak, when man-made resonance attempts to converse with the ancient echoes, the fate of this sea area may begin from this moment, sliding in a direction no one can predict. Mo Yuan Pavilion must ensure that it can still see the way forward and hold the rudder firmly in the midst of the turbulent current. Chapter 101 echo resonance.</p>
<p>The scheduled tidal window quietly arrived on the eve of a windless and oppressive dawn. All of Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s monitoring equipment was already operating at full power. The detection teams scattered across the designated observation points in the north and southwest were like silent sentinels hidden in well- camouflaged crevices of reefs or leeward spots on small islands. They breathed very softly, afraid of disturbing the sophisticated instruments ability to capture every sound wave and vibration in their surroundings. Inside the command center on the main island, the atmosphere was as still as iron.</p>
<p>Lynmo, Sherhow, Chanduo, Leewi, and Su Chanchian sat around a large table on which lay the latest nautical charts and various record forms. In the center was an audio signal receiver connected to the main channels of various observation points, heavily filtered and amplified on several devices nearby. Indicator lights of different colors flickered slightly with the fluctuations of background noise and chaotic lines danced on the waveform displays. Time ticked by and the calculated peak time of the window drew ever closer. Everyone stared intently at their assigned equipment or chart area, occasionally exchanging a few brief words in hushed whispers.</p>
<p>At 0.1 in the north zone, the background noise is stable and no abnormal sound source has been detected. Dot. At 3 in the southwest, the pulse roar interval in the target area is normal and the intensity reading remains at the baseline level. main island array. Everything is normal, calm, and almost deathly calm.</p>
<p>But this calm was more unsettling than any commotion. Just before the predicted peak point was about to be reached, unusual activity was first detected from the southwest. Southwest.1 reporting, a suppressed urgent voice came through the communicator. The target&#x27;s pulse roar intensity has begun to rise abnormally. The rate of increase is very fast.</p>
<p>It has exceeded the calibration baseline by 50% to 80%. And it&#x27;s still rising. Almost simultaneously, similar reports came from several other southwestern observation points. On the waveform display, several curves representing the direction of Misty Bay suddenly rose like a giant beast awakening and emitting a low roar. What about the frequency? Has the modulation signal changed? Leeway immediately asked.</p>
<p>The frequency appears to be drifting slightly upwards. The modulation depth of the modulation signal is increasing and the pattern is becoming more complex. Recording inside the command center, everyone&#x27;s hearts were in their throats. As expected, the wings of Liberty&#x27;s construct was propelled to an even higher power level when the tidal forces reached their peak. However, this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Just as the intensity of the pulsating roar from the southwest climbed to an unsettling peak and began to oscillate at high levels, reports from the northern observation points began to arrive. North zone 2 reporting continuous low frequency sound waves detected originating from the icebreaking area. Intensity slowly increasing. frequency is very low approaching the infrasound range accompanied by intermittent highfrequency harmonic pulses. The echo in the shattered eye zone has also been triggered.</p>
<p>Waveform characteristics. Are they consistent with what Dragon Soul detected before? Leeway&#x27;s voice trembled slightly, whether from nervousness or excitement, it was hard to tell. The core frequency characteristics are highly similar. However, the overall intensity and complexity far exceed previous records. The highfrequency harmonic pulse is newly added.</p>
<p>The two places, north and south, are far apart. Yet, they seem to have begun their performance simultaneously under the invisible batten of tidal forces. The southwest is a resonance that has been artificially amplified and carefully calibrated, while the north is an ancient and profound echo stimulated by external forces. Record all data. Listen carefully for any modulation signals hidden in the sound waves.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo ordered in a deep voice, his eyes fixed on the two constantly rising and oscillating curves on the waveform display. The next half hour was an acoustic storm. The pulsating roar from the southwest and the low frequency echoes from the north like two clumsy giants attempted a somewhat awkward yet powerful dialogue within the vast resonating cavity of the ocean. Their frequencies were not entirely synchronized, sometimes briefly overlapping, sometimes diverging, generating complex interference patterns. The broadband detectors deployed at Muan Pavilion captured a multitude of previously unseen acoustic phenomena, standing waves, beat frequencies, and harmonic resonances.</p>
<p>Suchian closed her eyes, trying hard to perceive the processed mixed sound waves coming from the receiver. Her face was slightly pale, chaotic, yet with a kind of tyrannical order. The sound from the southwest is like a person shouting at the top of their lungs, while the sound from the north is like a mountain slowly awakening, emitting a low sigh. There is no real understanding between them, more like a collision and probing of energy. Lee eyes focused on the data.</p>
<p>The energy level is too high. Especially the echoes from the ice flow area. The low frequency part of which has extremely strong energy penetration may have already affected the deep sea straighta structure over a large area. The resonance in the southwest is trying to catch up the frequency but it&#x27;s always a little short, unstable, etc. He suddenly widened his eyes and pointed to one of the screens displaying the energy distribution of a specific frequency band.</p>
<p>Look here. About 3 minutes ago, an unusual energy peak appeared near 7.83 hertz. This frequency is one of the fundamental frequencies of the Earth&#x27;s Schuman resonance. How could it appear here? And its intensity is slowly increasing. Schuman resonance.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s an extremely low frequency electromagnetic resonance phenomenon that exists between the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere and the Earth&#x27;s surface, usually associated with global lightning activity. How could it be excited or coupled by man-made sound waves? Although infrasound, before they could figure out, even more drastic changes occurred. The simple magnetometers and atmospheric electric field meters set up on the main island and at all observation points issued alarms almost simultaneously. Magnetic field disturbance, rapidly changing intensity, anomalous atmospheric electric field, accelerated charge accumulation. The nautical charts show that the anomaly is rapidly spreading outward from the misty bay and the ice flow area.</p>
<p>In the sky, the previously sparse clouds are visibly gathering and thickening, turning a somber iron gay color. On the sea, waves have risen even without wind. The waves are not high, but their directions are chaotic, as if the sea itself has become restless. Marine life. Observe the marine life.</p>
<p>Such Chian suddenly remembered something and heardly shouted. Soon, team members near the observation point reported that a large school of fish was fleeing in panic from beneath the surface and some deep sea fish were even surfacing belly up. Seabirds cried out in alarm and flew in flocks away from the center of the anomaly. the effects of infrasound and anomalous electromagnetic fields on organisms. Sue Chanchian said her voice tightening especially the frequency that is close to the Schuman resonance which may seriously interfere with the biological nervous system and migration instinct.</p>
<p>Just then an extremely sharp earpiercing highfrequency noise seemingly capable of tearing eardrums came from the main channel receiver connecting to the direction of the ice crushing area. It lasted for about 2 seconds. Then a low-frequency echo from the north abruptly weakened as if forcibly suppressed or interrupted by something. Almost simultaneously, the pulse boom from the southwest also experienced violent unstable fluctuations. Its intensity plummeted and the modulation signal became chaotic.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, it too abruptly stopped. After reaching a chaotic climax, the voices from both the north and the south fell silent almost simultaneously. Only the increasingly thick dark clouds in the sky, the chaotic aftershocks on the sea, and the still residual abnormal magnetic and electric field readings on the instruments proved that the brief but intense resonance just now was not an illusion. Is it over or has it been interrupted? Shin Duo Duo murmured. It has more like it got out of control due to instability, triggering some kind of protection mechanism or exceeding a certain critical point that leeway analyzed the rapidly changing waveform records.</p>
<p>The last highfrequency noise in the icebreaking area is very suspicious. It may be an overload reaction of its internal defense system. The structure in the southwest obviously failed to stabilize the resonance and went out of control. Shh looked at Linmo. Chief, what&#x27;s next? Lynn Mo slowly exhaled, his gaze sweeping over the environmental parameter readings on the screen, which were still slowly recovering.</p>
<p>All observation points maintain the highest level of silence and record all subsequent changes. Main island lift level one silence and move to level two alert. Shendo Duo, use all channels to collect reports of anomalies in other areas during the window period, especially the dragon soul controlled area. the possible activity areas of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and major trade routes. Leewi Sue Chian analyze all the data just recorded, especially the abnormal 7.83 herz energy peak, the final highfrequency noise and the detailed parameters before and after the soundwave interruption.</p>
<p>He paused, his tone grave. We witnessed, or rather heard the beginning of a process and perhaps a failed attempt, but the forces and intentions that triggered it remain. The first thunder of the storm has passed, but the clouds have not dispersed. We must figure out what that echo resonance just now meant, and what profound changes it will bring to this sea area. Dot.</p>
<p>The echoes had resounded. The resonance had ceased, but the aftershocks lingered. After a brief moment of shock, the observers of Muan Pavilion immediately plunged into the more complex work of data analysis and intelligence gathering. They knew that the real contest had perhaps only just begun. And what kind of door that key composed of sound and energy would open remained hidden deep within the solid ice of the North Sea and the dense fog of the Southwest.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 O2 analysis of the aftermath. The abrupt end of the echo resonance did not immediately bring about the anticipated violent conflict or earthshattering changes. On the contrary, for the next few days, an eerie post- disaster-like stagnation permeated the sea and sky. Reports from the external observation points of the Mo Yuan Pavilion continued to arrive in a southwest Misty Bay direction. The regular pulse booming had ceased after it stopped, and a thick fog covering the bay seemed even thicker and more solid than before, with even the usual ship traffic almost completely absent.</p>
<p>In a northern Icebreaker area, the Dragon Souls blockade remained in place, but the activity frequency of the research fleets on the periphery had significantly decreased, exhibiting more of a vigilant and wait and see attitude. An unusual calm often signifies a new phase in the underlying power struggle or the brewing of an even greater storm. Inside the Mo Yuan Pavilion, a period of highintensity, highdensity information processing and analysis has begun. Leewei and Sue Chanchian practically lived in the analysis room. The massive amount of data recorded by the broadband detector was like a huge chaotic treasure trove of acoustics and energy waiting to be sorted and interpreted.</p>
<p>They divided the data stream of the entire window event into dozens of time segments and frequency bands and performed spectral analysis, energy integration, and correlation comparison on each one. The most crucial discovery points to that brief unusual 7.83 herz energy peak. The appearance of this frequency is by no means accidental that Leewi&#x27;s eyes were bloodshot but his spirits were high. It coincides with the fundamental frequency of the earth schuman resonance. Our data shows that during the period when this energy peak appeared and intensified, the efficiency of the conversion of infrasound and low-frequency sound waves emitted by the two sound sources in the north and south into electromagnetic waves was abnormally improved, especially the part coupled with the atmospheric ionosphere.</p>
<p>This may mean that the structure of the wings of freedom and the ancient system of the ice flow zone under certain conditions could have their soundwave energy resonate or modulate with the global extremely low frequency electromagnetic field in a way that we do not yet understand. Suchanian added, biological observation records also support this. During the few minutes when that frequency energy peak was strongest, not only in the nearby sea area, but also at observation points further away, there were reports of intensified abnormal behavior in fish and birds. The Schuman resonance frequency is believed to be related to biological rhythms and nervous system activity, and the consequences of such imposed external interference are unpredictable. Would the stonemason brothers know about this? Chin duo duo frowned.</p>
<p>Could it be that the frequency correction parameters they gave to the Wings of Freedom were a deliberate attempt to lure it into touching this dangerous resonance point? Possibly, Leeway nodded. But judging from the final result, the resonance was clearly out of control. The final highfrequency noise counterattack of the icebreaking zone system may not just be a defense, but also a forced reset, interrupting the dangerous coupling process. The wings of freedom structure is estimated to have suffered considerable damage. Another important analytical conclusion concerns the patterns on the mysterious metal fragment.</p>
<p>Leeway attempted to digitize it and perform pattern matching with all the complex modulation signals recorded during the window event. Although no direct coded correspondence was found, after comparing the waveforms of certain high-frequency harmonic components in the last few seconds before the north and south sound sources ceased, he discovered a striking similarity. The mathematical abstract model of the double circular arc pattern on the metal fragment had a highly similar topological structure to the envelope shape of a transient component in that highfrequency harmonic. This likely means that the interface or marking represented by these patterns is related to handling specific types of highfrequency transient energy fluctuations. Leeway said excitedly, &quot;It may come from a more advanced control unit or safety valve that can stably handle this kind of dangerous resonance.</p>
<p>The discovery of its fragments on the wings of freedom structure either indicates that their technological origins contain such advanced components but failed to replicate or utilize them successfully or that a similar safety unit was destroyed in a previous test or accident. This deduction cast a deeper shadow over everyone&#x27;s hearts. The technology possessed by the Wings of Liberty might be more dangerous and incomplete than what they saw. And who was this force capable of creating such advanced security units? Just as the internal analysis was in full swing, Chindwood&#x27;s intelligence network finally managed to salvage some valuable fragments from the unusual aftershocks of the outside world. First, regarding Dragon Soul, multiple indirect sources confirm that following the window incident, Dragon Souls top leadership apparently held an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>Subsequently, its alert level around the shattered eye zone was raised to an unprecedented level, and several elite rapid reaction fleets were secretly deployed to the northwest to standby. Rumors suggest a serious internal division within Dragon Soul regarding whether to continue exploring the rift further. One faction advocates taking action as soon as possible during the relatively stable period after the ancient systems reset to obtain core samples or data. The other warns of excessive risk, arguing that unknown defense mechanisms have been triggered, and a shift to long-term monitoring and research is necessary to avoid further provocation. Secondly, there was the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood.</p>
<p>This organization seemed to vanish after the incident. Their speciallydesed speedboats never appeared at any known surveillance points, and even their usual procurement of technical materials was temporarily suspended. However, a high-ranking informant planted by Chandu Duo in the East Reef black market reported that three days after the incident, several elusive and distinctive individuals appeared deep within the black market, offering high price rewards through intermediaries for intelligence or physical samples related to highfrequency energy pulse physical protection technology and rapid stabilization methods for geomagnetic anomalies. The requirements were extremely specialized and payment was to be made in anonymous rare metal ingots. The informant suspected these individuals were connected to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and might also be assessing the losses and urgently seeking countermeasures.</p>
<p>The most unexpected intelligence was related to Vera&#x27;s team. A friendly caravan operating near the eastern sleeping ridge on its return voyage unexpectedly discovered Vera&#x27;s threemasted sailing ship in a remote atal lagoon. The ship appeared to have undergone emergency repairs with fresh signs of patching on the hull and it lay there quietly with no one visible on board. The caravan dared not approach hastily leaving before relaying the news back. They&#x27;ve got to hiding too or maybe they&#x27;re fixing something.</p>
<p>So during that meeting they might not have been just bystanders or messengers. Lynmo, having synthesized all the analysis reports and intelligence fragments, stood before the constantly updated situation map and fell into deep thought. The window incident was like a dangerous experiment, verifying some terrifying conjectures and exposing the bottom lines and dilemmas of all parties. The ancient system possessed powerful defense and reset capabilities. The Wings of Liberty&#x27;s adventure ended in failure and potential heavy losses.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s technology had risks and limitations. Strategic disagreements arose within Dragon Soul, and Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s whereabouts became even more mysterious. For Mo Yuon Pavilion, this incident did not pose a direct threat. Instead, it provided an extremely valuable opportunity to observe the highle game up close, gaining a wealth of firsthand data. However, this also meant that they had glimpsed deeper secrets and inadvertently formed a closer connection with them.</p>
<p>Our strategy needs a slight adjustment. Lynn Mo finally spoke, his voice calm, but decisive. Continue to maintain level two alert, but shift our focus from comprehensive monitoring to targeted tracking of external intelligence. Pay close attention to two points. First, the outcome of the internal debate within Dragon Soul and its subsequent course of action.</p>
<p>Second, the initial movements of the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood after they resumed their activities, especially the evolution of their technological needs. He turned to Leewi and Sue Shian. Your research direction also needs to be adjusted. Suspend the exploration of the general common grammar and focus on two things. First, based on the correlation between the texture of metal sheets and highfrequency harmonics, try to reverse engineer the schematic diagram of a simple device that can theoretically buffer or cancel similar dangerous energy transients, even if it has just the conceptual design.</p>
<p>Second, conduct in-depth research on the generation conditions and potential impact of the 7.83 herz anomalous energy peak and assess whether it can be more safely induced or shielded. We need to try to transform from observers to understanders and limited defenders. Dot. He then looked at Sureh How and Chin Duo in internal defense plan. Add items to deal with abnormal electromagnetic field interference and infrasound pollution.</p>
<p>Supplies inventory list. Add possible protective materials against the above threats. for external transactions. Continue to keep them low frequency and discreet, but we can appropriately release some of our observations on the impact of environmental anomalies on organisms by blurring them out to test the market reaction and see if we can attract potential communicators with relevant protective technologies or knowledge. The aftershocks haven&#x27;t subsided and the analysis continues.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan survived this unexpected resonance and managed to seize valuable data fragments. Next, they will use these fragments to piece together a more complete picture of the world and forge a unique shield of knowledge to offer some protection against future storms. Danger still lurks, but through meticulous analysis, the direction forward seems to be becoming clearer. Chapter 103 tests and choices. The aftermath of the window incident transformed within Mayuan Pavilion into more refined knowledge accumulation and strategic adjustments.</p>
<p>While the deep waters outside after a brief period of silence began to ripple in new directions, Leewi and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s research has entered a critical stage. The difficulty of reverse engineering the principle of the energy transient buffer device far exceeded expectations. Although the patterns on the metal fragments have a topological correlation with dangerous highfrequency harmonics, their specific working principle, material properties, and energy conversion paths are almost entirely enigmatic. They tried various known physical models for simulation, but the results were unsatisfactory. The biggest bottleneck lies in their lack of the most crucial element.</p>
<p>What exactly is the medium for the interface represented by those patterns? Is it some kind of electromagnetic wave in a specific frequency band? Is it a more peculiar particle flow? Or is it some kind of direct conversion of soundwave energy forms? Without this premise, all designs are like castles in the air. We might need a sample even if it s damaged as long as we can analyze its internal structure and material composition. Leewi reported to Lin Mo rubbing his temples wearily. Or we need more fundamental textbook style information on the energy theories of ancient civilizations rather than scattered application symbols. Such Chian&#x27;s research has made relatively more progress, but it is also full of uncertainties.</p>
<p>She has been continuously tracking the subsequent effects of the 7.8 83 hertz anomalous energy peak. By analyzing the biological behavior data transmitted back from various observation points after the window event, although the sample size was limited and indirect, she found that this anomalous energy interference seemed to leave some kind of hysteresus effect. In the days following the event, the phototactic/photophobic behavior of fish and the opening and closing rhythms of shallow sea mollis in the affected area showed persistent disturbances, although the degree was slight and they slowly recovered over time. This indicates that the interference of the imposed external resonance on the biological physiological rhythms did not subside immediately. It acts like a giant bell being struck hard.</p>
<p>Even though the sound stops, the bell is still vibrating slightly. Sue Chian explained, &quot;If this striking is more frequent or more intense, it could cause irreversible disruption of the biological clock and even affect the reproduction of the population. The long-term effects are incalculable.&quot; These research advances have on the one hand deepened Moan G&#x27;s understanding of potential threats and on the other hand made them more clearly aware of the limitations of their own technology and a lack of knowledge. Just as the internal research was making difficult progress, Chandwa&#x27;s intelligence network captured a clearer analysis of the Dragon Souls movements, several Dragon Soul rapid reaction fleets deployed to the northwest did not withdraw. Instead, they established temporary forward bases at several strategic locations.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, several large shipyards and precision instrument workshops under Dragon Souls control received urgent orders to begin mass production of specially designed small to medium-sized deep sea submersible platforms and ruggedized sample storage tanks suitable for the complex environment of the ice zone. These signs strongly suggest that the radical exploration faction within Dragon Soul appears to have gained the upper hand, and they&#x27;re making substantial material preparations for a potentially larger and more thoroughly prepared deep sea operation into the ice crack zone. However, in subtle contrast to this tough stance, Dragon Soul has released some ambiguous signals seeking cooperation on diplomatic and intelligence levels. Xiao Ji Gang sent Lin Mo another, more direct letter through a backup encrypted channel neither party had used before. The letter cut to the chase, directly mentioning the abnormal energy coupling phenomenon observed during the window and the resulting regional environmental disturbances, frankly stating that Dragon Souls research department was highly concerned and deeply worried about it.</p>
<p>The letter pointed out that neither party&#x27;s existing knowledge and technology could fully understand or address the complex risks originating from ancient systems. Therefore, based on shared survival and security considerations, Dragon Soul hoped to engage in a non-public high level and pragmatic technical dialogue with Mo Yuinga, which possessed a certain level of technical insight and operational stability on the topic of the principles and security boundary assessment of ancient energy systems. Dragon Soul was willing to provide some non-core taxonomic data on specific ancient energy patterns as a basis for the dialogue. This letter was more frank and targeted than ever before. It acknowledged the risks, highlighted the value of the Mo Yuon Pavilion, technical insight, operational stability, and offered a seemingly sincere advanced payment ancient energy pattern classification data.</p>
<p>Clearly, Dragon Soul not only noticed the Mo Yuan Pavilion silent observation during the window incident, or rather guessed that the Mo Yuan Pavilion had the ability to observe, but also likely learned through some channels that the Mo Yuan Pavilion was conducting related research internally. They feel they can&#x27;t crack that tough nut on their own. So, they want to get us involved to find a solution or at least share the risks and ideas. Shin duo duo analyzed the taxonomic data they provide might just fill in the basic theory puzzle that engineer Lee is most missing. Sure how remain vigilant.</p>
<p>They might also want to find out how far our research has progressed or even try to exploit our research ideas. They are in a hurry to act now and they will be interested in anything that might accelerate their understanding process. Such Xian said worriedly. Won&#x27;t having such high level technical dialogues with them expose too much of our research direction and progress. Moreover, once such deep technical ties are established, it will be difficult to completely severize later.</p>
<p>Leeway was torn. The taxonomic data promised by Dragon Soul held a fatal attraction for him. It might be the key to deciphering the Hemlock Island slab, understanding the patterns of the metal fragments, and even designing protective devices. But he also knew that it was likely a tempting lure. All eyes were once again focused on Lin Mo engaging in deeper technical exchanges with Dragon Soul amplified both the risks and opportunities like never before.</p>
<p>Lynmo didn&#x27;t make a decision immediately. He carefully studied Xiao Gangs letter, scrutinizing every word. Behind dragon souls urgency and frankness lay immense pressure from the rifts in the shattered ice zone and a deep apprehension about the unknown risks hidden behind them. They didn&#x27;t need allies or at least a think tank that could offer different perspectives. In response to Xiao Ji Gang Linimo said slowly after a long period of thought.</p>
<p>Emoy Yuan Pavilion is also concerned about the potential risks of the ancient energy system and is willing to conduct limited technical exchanges on the security boundary assessment. We agree to accept the taxonomic data they provide as the basis for dialogue in a demonstration of our sincerity. However, the method of communication must be clearly defined. It must be in writing only through a designated encrypted channel. The topic must be strictly limited to the functional classification of specific energy patterns and their corresponding potential risks and must not involve any specific relic coordinates, physical sample information, or specific technical implementation paths for either party.</p>
<p>We reserve complete autonomy over whether and how to respond to the content of the exchange. If you agree, we may send some sample data in advance as a sign of our sincerity. This is an extremely cautious response, retaining ample initiative and a backup plan. We accept the materials and open a highly restricted area for written discussion, but we do not commit to any substantive cooperation or reciprocal exchange of information. We&#x27;ll see how the goods Dragon Soul offers are before deciding whether and how to continue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Linmo added Chindu Duo used the highest level resources to investigate the details of recent decisions within Dragon Soul regarding the Shattered Eye Zone project, especially after the Radical Faction took the lead. Whether there has been any leak of their specific action plans and timelines, we need to determine whether their pursuit of dialogue is a genuine search for solutions or merely an additional theoretical insurance for their risky actions. The letter was sent like yet another tenative move. Meanwhile, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood seemed to have truly fallen into complete silence, utterly still, and the misty bay of the Southwest remained shrouded in a thick, ominous fog, utterly desolate. Vera&#x27;s team sailboat remained anchored in that remote at all lagoon.</p>
<p>Showing no signs of leaving or sending any new information. Like a group of patient anglers or perhaps wounded beasts, they quietly licked their wounds in the shadows, observing the changing tides. Mo Yuan Pavilion continues to seek a balance between accumulating strength and cautious exploration. While awaiting the Dragon Soul data, Leewi and Sue Chian continued to dig out potentially overlooked details from the existing data. Sher House guard team conducted an extreme pressure exercise based on the scenario of complete communication outage and command node failure.</p>
<p>honing their grassroots autonomous combat and survival capabilities under worst case conditions. Lynn Mo knew that this tentative contact with the dragon&#x27;s soul might open a new door, or it might introduce new risks beneath the fog of the southwest and the solid ice of the north. The real undercurrents might never have stopped, but we&#x27;re just waiting for the next perhaps more decisive window. The choice has been made and the test has begun. The Mo Yuan Pavilion, like a ship sailing through increasingly complex and treacherous seas, must simultaneously steer its external communications and maintain its internal defenses, cautiously navigating the fog towards its chosen direction.</p>
<p>Chapter 104. Data and the fog. Chapter 104. Dragon Souls reply came faster than expected. Less than two days after Lin Mo sent that strictly encrypted letter, a speciallymade metal cylinder sealed with multiple layers of anti-tampering measures was delivered to a hidden receiving point on the outskirts of Mo Yuon Pavilion through an absolutely secure one-way transmission channel.</p>
<p>The sender&#x27;s identity was unknown. The handover was clean and efficient, and no trace was left behind. The metal cylinder was immediately delivered to the reinforcement analysis room where Leewi and Su Chanchian were located. The two of them personally operated the opening process while Sher How and his men guarded the perimeter to ensure everything went smoothly. Inside the cylinder, there were no letters, only a stack of white paper of a special texture, thin yet tough, with a complex array of symbols drawn clearly and neatly in ink accompanied by concise text annotations.</p>
<p>As Xiao Ji Gang promised, this is a taxonomic document on ancient energy patterns. The document systematically categorizes hundreds of different symbolic patterns into 12 major categories and dozens of subcategories based on their geometric characteristics, the flow of their strokes and their location and context in known archaeological sites. Each category includes a brief name and hypothetical function such as energy conducting type suspected of guiding and constraining energy flow commonly found at channel or pipeline interfaces. Converging type, possibly used for energy gathering and amplification, often seen on the periphery of suspected energy core areas, and buffer/dissipative type, speculated to be used to smooth energy fluctuations or safely release excess energy, often appearing at structural weak points or on the inner walls of enclosed spaces, etc. Very professional and systematic, Leeway quickly flipped through the document, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>Although it&#x27;s just classification and speculation without specific energy parameters and implementation principles, this systematic approach to induction is of great reference value for understanding the possible positioning of different symbols within the entire technical system. Look, they&#x27;ve categorized those composite symbols in the third section of our hemlock island slab into the subclass control command type. Composite patterns possibly used to send or verify specific operation commands. complex structure often associated with suspected permission verification areas. This judgment is highly consistent with our previous conjecture.</p>
<p>Such an also examined it carefully. Their description of the characteristics of buffering/dissipation type texture overlaps with what we saw in Vera&#x27;s data and the feeling that the texture on the metal sheet gives us. But the classification here is more detailed and it also mentions the suspected distinguishing features of highfrequency transient buffering and low-frequency steadystate dissipation. This may help us narrow down the scope of the inference of the function of the metal sheet texture. However, after the initial excitement, a closer examination brought doubts.</p>
<p>Chi and Duodu pointed to a detail. The texture of these papers and the ink stains don&#x27;t resemble long preserved ancient books or archival copies. They seem more like recently meticulously copied texts. Moreover, although the classification is systematic, all the functional descriptions use words like suspected, possible, and speculated without any definitive conclusions. This can certainly be understood as academic rigor, but it could also be a tentative exploration with reservations.</p>
<p>Leeway calmed down and nodded. Indeed, the value of this data lies in providing a grand classification framework, but it lacks the most crucial specific energy parameters, activation conditions, and input output relationships corresponding to each type of pattern. It&#x27;s like giving us a car parts catalog that describes in detail the shape and installation location of spark plugs, pistons, and gearboxes, but doesn&#x27;t provide the fuel grade, ignition timing, or gear ratio. We still can&#x27;t build a working car or even verify whether these parts descriptions are completely accurate, but this catalog itself is the most systematic information we have come across so far. Such Chian said, &quot;At least it proves that Dragon Soul or the research forces behind them had a long history of accumulation and in-depth thinking in this field and their willingness to share this framework itself shows a certain sincerity or rather an urgent need.&quot; Lynn, Emo listened to the detailed report.</p>
<p>He instructed Leewi and Sue Chian to continue their in-depth analysis of the data, especially comparing its classification with the known patterns of the Hemlock Island stone slabs and metal fragments to see if they could discover any previously overlooked connections or contradictions. At the same time, he asked Chandu Duo to expedite the gathering of intelligence on Dragon Souls internal decision-making processes. Several days later, Chandua&#x27;s investigation yielded clear results. Based on information from multiple indirect sources, the internal debate within Dragon Soul regarding the shattered eyes project had indeed ended with a limited radical exploration faction gaining the upper hand. The so-called limited meant that they rejected the risky plan of immediately carrying out large-scale armed excavation or force breakthrough, but approve an upgrade action plan.</p>
<p>The core of the plan is to manufacture and utilize a fleet of more robust intelligent submersibles equipped with a wider variety of detection devices to conduct a more comprehensive and targeted exploration of the ice crush fractures during the next relatively stable geoysical window. Dragon Soul seems to have its own calculation method estimating it to be in 2 months. The goal is to create a more detailed three-dimensional map of the fracture interior, locate possible core units or controlling regions, and attempt to obtain a wider variety of physical samples. The entire operation emphasizes non-cont non-invasive exploration. Sample collection will only be considered when safety is ensured and the objective is clearly defined.</p>
<p>They become more cautious. The unexpected countermeasures from the window incident have clearly left them shaken. Chi and Duo Duo analyzed. But they haven&#x27;t t given up. Instead, they ve invested even more resources in more meticulous preparations.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re seeking technical exchanges with us is likely an attempt to leverage external expertise to help them better understand the samples and probe data, assess the risks, and even find theoretically safe pathways for any eventual contact or interaction. Dot. Meanwhile, Leewi and Su Chanchian&#x27;s data analysis also made crucial progress. They discovered that several subclass symbolic features in the classification system provided by Dragon Soul concerning highfrequency transient buffers and energy state markers exhibited a striking multi-layered agreement with the double circular arc patterns on the metal fragments and certain mathematical characteristics of the abnormal highfrequency harmonics that appeared in the final stage of the window event. This agreement was not merely a simple shape similarity, but involved deeper geometric attributes such as the curvature variation of the patterns and the distribution of symmetry defects.</p>
<p>This almost certainly confirms that the patterns on the metal sheet belong to a special safety interface or control node used by ancient civilizations to handle or identify certain highfrequency transient and dangerous energy fluctuations. leak axadi. The classification data from dragon soul provides a crucial circumstantial evidence framework for confirming this. Moreover, the data mentions that such patterns are often found alongside isolation valves or pressure relief devices suspected to be main energy pathways in some relics. Suchanian then made another discovery.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the description of a special subclass of energy conducting patterns resonant focusing in the data mentions that under certain conditions this type of pattern may guide energy to form a standing wave interference field thereby selectively amplifying or attenuating external energy at a specific frequency. Could this be used to explain why the ancient system in the ice shard zone produced such a strong echo response to the calibrated pulse roar emitted by the wings of freedom construct? Because the frequency of a construct happens to fall on the sensitive band of a certain resonant focusing channel. These discoveries further connect fragmented information. Although the Dragon Soul data does not provide ready-made answers, its systematic classification framework is like a map with many blank spaces but clear coordinates, allowing the Mo Yuan Pavilion to place the existing scattered landmarks more accurately, thereby inferring more terrain outlines. We will compile our findings, especially the correlation between highfrequency transient buffer patterns and metal sheets, dangerous harmonics, and our conjectures about resonant focusing and echo phenomena into a highly summarized technical speculation brief.</p>
<p>Stripped of all specific source attributions, Lynn Mo decided as a preliminary response to the classification data provided by Dragon Soul. The brief can raise two open questions for discussion. First, what risks might the failure or absence of such safety interface patterns pose to the associated systems? Second, how should the safety boundaries be defined when external artificial resonance couples with the inherent focusing channels of the ancient system? He paused for a moment. This is the bait we&#x27;ve thrown out. We&#x27;ll see if Dragon Soul just wants to get our ideas or if they&#x27;re really willing to have a substantial exchange on the core issue of safety boundaries.</p>
<p>At the same time, we&#x27;ll continue to delve deeper into our own research, especially based on a new framework and try to design a conceptual model of that buffer device, even if it&#x27;s just on paper. The data, like a key, unlocked a window into the internal structure of ancient technological systems. Yet, the fog still shrouded the southwestern bay, the eastern atal, and the ice covered fissures of the north. With cautious exploration, the Mo Yuan Pavilion quietly took a small step forward. They began using borrowed maps, comparing them with the scattered landmarks they had discovered, attempting to sketch a more realistic outline of that unknown continent.</p>
<p>The road ahead remained fraught with uncertainty, but the light in their hands seemed slightly brighter than before. Chapter 105 response and bargaining chips. The carefully worded technical speculation briefing from Myuan Pavilion, which removed all specific references, was like another stone thrown into a deep pool, creating ripples on the other end of the encrypted channel that were both expected and somewhat unexpected. Dragon Souls reply was swift as ever. And this time, Xiao Ji Gangs letter contained less official politeness and more direct technical discussion.</p>
<p>He first expressed high appreciation for Mo Yuinga&#x27;s keen insight and constructive speculation, believing that the two open-ended questions raised in the briefing hit the core dilemma currently facing research. Regarding the first question about the risk of safety interface failure, Longhun&#x27;s response did not provide a definitive answer, but instead offered a new appendix, a statistical summary on the correlation between stress distribution and energy overload in ancient composite structures. The summary shows that in over 70% of the known cases of relic sites showing signs of structural damage or energy runaway, severe wear, fracture or functional loss of highfrequency transient buffer patterns was found near the damaged area or related control nodes. The summary cautiously points out that this correlation strongly suggests rather than proves that such patterns play a crucial role in maintaining the local stability of the system and a failure could be a trigger or accelerator of energy runaway. They&#x27;re using statistical data to support our hypothesis, Leeway exclaimed excitedly after reading the appendix.</p>
<p>Although it is still just a hint, it is a step further than simple taxonomy. They must have more data on damaged sites. This summary is just the tip of the iceberg. Regarding the second question about the safety boundary of resonant coupling, Longhun&#x27;s response was more cautious, even somewhat vague. The letter acknowledged that currently very little is known about the frequency response characteristics, sensitivity thresholds, and interaction mechanisms with non-native resonances of the resonant focusing channels within ancient systems and that reliable experimental verification methods are lacking.</p>
<p>However, Longhun proposed that based on existing data and observational data of window events, they have preliminarily established a framework for a multiparameter risk assessment model to simulate the system response spectrum that may be triggered by external resonant inputs of different frequencies, intensities, and durations. They are willing under the premise of strict data anonymization and model simplification to share the model&#x27;s basic architecture and input output logic with Moyuan hoping to jointly improve it. They want to get us involved in perfecting this model. Sue Chanchian pointed out astutely this means they admit they can&#x27;t handle it themselves and need external expertise. Moreover, this model is likely to be crucial to their upcoming probe operation.</p>
<p>And they need the model to assess whether the probe operation itself will inadvertently trigger a system countermeasure. Chando Duo stroked his chin. First it was the classification framework. Now it&#x27;s the risk assessment model framework. They&#x27;re gradually adding more trying to use this half-finish knowledge to lure out more ideas and verifications from us.</p>
<p>However, this model framework itself is also very valuable for us to assess the risk of that structure in the southwest going crazy again. Linmo carefully read the letter and the new appendix. Dragon Souls response strategy was becoming increasingly clear. They possessed a wealth of fundamental data and research frameworks, but had encountered bottlenecks in the most crucial areas of theoretical breakthroughs and practical application verification, urgently needing new ideas and cross validation. The insight previously demonstrated by Mo Yuan Pavilion had shown them its value.</p>
<p>We can agree, Lynn Mo concluded. We will accept their model framework sharing. Leeway, you will lead a team to study and understand this framework and try to incorporate our existing data, window event records, metal plate texture analysis, and even related conjectures for Vera&#x27;s data to see what inferences we can draw or what contradictions we can find. Remember, we are studying the framework and logic, not any specific detection data or rea parameters of the dragon soul dot. He paused, then added, &quot;In return, we can share our preliminary observations, also desensitized, regarding the potential delayed interference of the 7.83 herz anomalous energy peak on biological rhythms with them as a supplementary environmental risk assessment reference.</p>
<p>This would not only demonstrate our value, but also align with their concern about systemic risks. This is a deeper technical exchange, but remains at the level of framework to framework and conjecture to conjecture. Without touching on either party&#x27;s core data or specific action plans, Mo Yuan uses its unique perspective and analytical capabilities to exchange for Dragon Souls systematic research tools and a broader data background. A new round of written communication ensued. Leeway&#x27;s team quickly immersed themselves in analyzing the risk assessment model framework provided by Longhun.</p>
<p>This framework was rigorously structured with numerous parameters considering various variables such as energy frequency, intensity, waveform, duration of action, environmental medium, and even local geomagnetic and gravitational gradients. Its complexity far exceeded any existing analytical tool in Muan Pavilion. Although it was merely an empty shell without any actual data, its design concept itself was highly inspiring. They considered everything very comprehensively, especially by including environmental factors as important variables, which is consistent with our observation that window events are affected by tidal forces. Leeway praised them, but also felt the pressure.</p>
<p>To actually run this model, a massive amount of basic parameters and calibration data are needed, which are probably only available to Dragon Soul itself. Such Chian was responsible for compiling Mo Yuinga&#x27;s observations on biological interference into a rigorous report. She specifically emphasized the limitations of the data and the preliminary nature of the inferences, but used clear logic to point out the possibility of a potential coupling between abnormal energy frequencies and biological rhythms and its farreaching impact. Although the report was brief, it touched upon a soft risk dimension concerning the entire ecosystem that might have been overlooked by the Dragon Soul technical faction. As the technological exchanges between the two sides deepened, the fog surrounding the outside world was also quietly changing.</p>
<p>The deathly silence of the southwestern foggy bay was finally broken. According to reports from the outer surveillance points, the fog concentration in the bay had fluctuated irregularly over the past few days, sometimes briefly thinning to reveal the outline of the massive silent fortress behind it. No ships were seen entering or leaving, nor were any more pulses heard, but that unsettling silence seemed to be replaced by a new, indescribable presence. The captain of the bribe supply ship sent back his last message, after which contact was lost, saying that during his last entry, the atmosphere inside the fortress felt very oppressive. The guards were tighter.</p>
<p>Ordinary personnel were forbidden from approaching the central area, and there seemed to be a faint ozone-like metallic smell in the air. Meanwhile, in the east, the sailboat belonging to Vera&#x27;s team, which had been anchored in the Atal Lagoon, was discovered one morning to have vanished without a trace, leaving no clues or information. They had disappeared as silently as they had arrived. Even more noteworthy is the resurgence of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, an organization that had been dormant for a long time. While they ceased large-scale procurement of technical materials, Chindwood&#x27;s informants discovered in the most hidden corners of the East Reef black market that someone was beginning to acquire intelligence on high efficiency tidal energy conversion technology and precise mapping data of deep sea geothermal anomalies at exorbitant prices, demanding near obsessive accuracy and timeliness.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, several smaller factions that had previously engaged in clandestine transactions with the remnants of the Wings of Freedom received warnings from unknown sources, instructing them to handle all transactions in the Southwest with caution in the near future to avoid getting involved in uncontrollable energy pollution. Is the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood clearing out the perimeter also preparing for some kind of operation that requires the support of tidal energy and geothermal energy? Shin Duo Duo analyzed. They seem to have abandoned the route of directly stimulating the ice flows or being deeply tied to the wings of liberty and turned to a more covert and perhaps more basic technological direction. Lynmo, considering the progress of technological exchanges and the changing external landscape, gradually pieced together a more complete yet increasingly complex picture. The Dragon Soul was gathering strength, preparing for a more precise probe.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood adjusted its strategy. Their target remained unclear. The remnants of the wings of freedom seemed to be licking their wounds, but had not lost their threat. Vera&#x27;s team once again vanished into the shadows. While Mo Yuanu has not yet obtained any direct treasure during this in-depth technical dialogue with Dragon Soul, they have quietly extended their knowledge tentacles into a higher level, more systematic research field and begun to learn how to use more advanced analytical tools.</p>
<p>They used their unique observations as bargaining chips to gain the right to listen in and began to try to understand the deeper rules of this grand game. This is perhaps more important than directly acquiring one or two ancient artifacts. In an era where knowledge and information are the core power, understanding the framework itself is a form of power accumulation. Lyn Mo knew that how long and how deep this framework level cooperation with Dragon Soul could last depended on whether Moan Pavilion could continue to provide the unique perspectives and verification value that the other party needed. He had to ensure that Leewi and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s research could not only draw nourishment from Dragon Souls framework, but also maintain an independent direction of thinking and even see further and more meticulously than Dragon Soul in some aspects.</p>
<p>The response has been given and the chips have been laid out on the table. The ensuing game will test wisdom and composure even more. The ship of my pavilion using borrowed nautical charts is learning to draw its own more precise course. But beneath the distant fog and ice, the true undercurrents never cease, waiting only for the next opportune moment to surge forth once more. Chapter 106.</p>
<p>Frequent ominous signs. The exchange of technical frameworks with Dragon Soul was like injecting high octane fuel into the research engine of Mo Yuan Pavilion. Wally&#x27;s team was limited by a lack of actual data and unable to conduct a true simulation when analyzing the complex risk assessment model framework. The framework&#x27;s rigorous logical structure and multivariable coupling analytical approach greatly expanded their thinking. They began to try to use the language of this framework to re-examine and articulate Moyuan Pavilion&#x27;s existing findings, especially the causal chain regarding the uncontrolled energy coupling in the window event.</p>
<p>If we consider the ancient system of the ice shatter zone as a black box with multiple resonant focusing channels and safety buffer nodes, Leeway drew a simplified diagram on the whiteboard explaining his new understanding to Lynn Mo, Su Chanchian, and Shien Duo Duo. The pulse roar of the wings of freedom construct is equivalent to inputting a high intensity but technically crude resonant signal into one of the focusing channels at a specific frequency. This signal not only excites the systems echo response but may also due to its impure waveform or improper modulation accidentally stimulate multiple adjacent channels with different functions simultaneously including those safety nodes responsible for energy transient buffering dot. He pointed to several connected nodes in a diagram based on the energy overload transfer algorithm of the dragon soul framework. When a safe node becomes functionally weakened or fails due to overload, its burden will be transferred to adjacent nodes forming a chain reaction.</p>
<p>This may explain why such dangerous highfrequency harmonics and global energy runaway eventually occur. the safety network is partially breached leading to a temporary instability of the system until a higher level forced reset mechanism is triggered. Such Chanchin added, &quot;This also aligns with the high correlation between damage to the security patterns and system malfunction mentioned in the Dragon Soul data. The Wings of Freedom&#x27;s construct is like a rough iron rod that has been forcefully inserted into the gear train of a precision clock. This interpretation based on a new framework makes the entire window event process clearer and more cautionary.</p>
<p>It shows that attempting any form of interaction with these ancient systems is like dancing on the edge of a minefield. The slightest misstep could trigger not only a counterattack from the target system, but also a chain reaction of collapses in its internal security mechanisms with unpredictable consequences. What does this mean for Dragon Souls probe plan? Lynmo asked. This means they have to be extremely cautious. Leewi said definitively.</p>
<p>Their detection signals must be infinitely more precise than the iron rod of the wings of freedom and they must avoid known vulnerable areas of safe nodes as much as possible. Even so, risk still exists because we know nothing about the distribution and vulnerability thresholds of those nodes that no matter how good their model framework is, without this crucial data, it has just empty talk. Dot. Just as internal research was deepening with the help of new tools, external ominous signs began to appear in a more frequent and unsettling way. First, there was the misty bay of the southwest.</p>
<p>After a brief period of fog fluctuations, that sea area seemed to fall into a deeper, more deathly silence. Even the usual seabirds avoided that airspace. But Chiendwood&#x27;s advanced reconnaissance points deployed further away and equipped with long range infrared and lowlight observation devices transmitted puzzling images. On a moonless deep night through highly sensitive equipment, the outline of the massive fortress deep in the bay was observed to have briefly shimmerred with an extremely faint dark red inner halo several times. The brightness and dimness of the halo seemed to have an extremely slow breathing rhythm, each lasting for a few minutes before disappearing.</p>
<p>There was no accompanying sound or energy fluctuation, at least not detected by the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s equipment. It looks like something is running at low power or slowly charging. Sure, how frowned as he looked at the blurry video recording. The remnants of Wings of Liberty are still tinkering with that thing, and they&#x27;ve become even more secretive about it. Meanwhile, some unsettling strange occurrences began to appear sporadically in the eastern and southern waters.</p>
<p>Several caravans and fishing vessels traveling along different routes reported encounters with mad sea monsters. These monsters did not actively attack the ships, but rather exhibited extreme frenzy and chaos, rampaging and tearing at each other on the surface near the convoys. Some even recklessly crashing into reefs until they were exhausted or died. The types of frenzied sea monsters varied, ranging from common sharks and large schools of fish to some normally docil deep sea species. Even stranger, the locations of these events seemed random, and the timing showed no obvious pattern.</p>
<p>Yet, subsequent tests of the water quality and background noise in the affected areas revealed no toxic substances or abnormal sound sources. Such Chanchian attached great importance to these reports, linking them to her previous speculation that the 7.83 83 hertz anomalous energy peak might cause lag interference with biological rhythms. If the effect of that interference is cumulative or if there&#x27;s some kind of more insidious subsequent energy radiation that we haven&#x27;t yet detected even though the window event has passed its residual poison may still be slowly spreading affecting the nervous systems of marine life over a wider area. She worried could these frenzied events be manifestations of this lag effect. This speculation is chilling.</p>
<p>If a localized failed resonance experiment can have such lasting and widespread ecological impacts, what kind of disaster would a larger scale more successful interaction bring? The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s new moves are gradually coming to light. Their continued high-priced acquisitions of high efficiency tidal energy conversion technology and deep sea geothermal anomaly mapping data are becoming increasingly specific, indicating a clear application orientation. Based on fragmented information from various sources, she duodo believes the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is secretly building a sizable energy harvesting and conversion base in a remote geologically active sea area far from mainstream shipping routes. Their purpose is unclear, but they clearly require a stable and powerful input of natural energy. What are they trying to do by abandoning direct stimulation of ancient systems and instead utilizing natural energy? Are they trying to power some kind of energyintensive equipment or are they conducting long-term research that requires a stable energy environment? Chian do guest.</p>
<p>In any case, it shows that they have changed their strategy from seizing to building dot. What concerned Lynn Mo most was an unverified rumor from a northern border trading post. The rumor claimed that explorers returning from the edge of the far northern perafrost wasteland reported a rare phenomenon of blue ice melting in certain areas where the wasteland met the icy sea. This wasn&#x27;t ordinary ice melting, but rather the melting of ancient ice layers, some millions of years old, containing special air bubbles and minerals that gave them their deep blue color, with honeycomb like melting holes appearing from within, oozing a slightly salty fishy liquid of unknown composition. The explorers also claimed to have heard a dull rhythmic thumping sound seemingly coming from the Earth&#x27;s core near those areas.</p>
<p>Is the ancient blue ice of the perafrost region melting abnormally? And what about the regular muffled sounds coming from underground? The rumor, though seemingly absurd, pierced Lin Moe&#x27;s mind like a cold needle. He recalled the fissurers in the ice crushing region and the conjecture that ancient systems might be scattered across the globe beneath the ice of the perafrost wasteland. Did some ancient creation also slumber? was a resonance of that window event like a pebble thrown into a pond, creating ripples that somehow traveled to distant places, awakening or disturbing other slumbering beings. Strange omens appeared frequently from the southwest to the northeast, from the sea to the ice fields. The world seemed like a disturbed giant with various inexplicable neurotic twitches appearing in different parts of its body.</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside the Mo Yuan Pavilion Command Center was heavy. Intelligence reports and unusual findings from various parties were piled on the table, resembling a chaotic cloud map foreshadowing an impending storm. Strengthen monitoring in all directions, especially long-term tracking of abnormal marine biological behavior and environmental parameters. Lynn Mo instructed Leeway. Your group should try to use the dragon soul framework to build a simplified ecological disturbance risk assessment submodel focusing on assessing the potential chronic impacts of different energy frequencies and intensities on typical marine populations.</p>
<p>We need to quantify this threat. He looked at the remote sea area marked on the nautical chart as the suspected activity area of the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood. Chanduo find a way to infiltrate that area. You don&#x27;t need to go deep. just confirm the approximate location, size, and possible purpose of their base.</p>
<p>Be careful not to alert them. Finally, his gaze fell on the blank space representing the perafrost of the north. As for the rumors about the north, put them on hold for now, but inform all our spies along the northern trade routes to be on the lookout for any new information about geology, ice, or unusual sounds. The unknown is spreading and threats are mutating. The Mo Yuan Pavilion cannot simply passively record these anomalies.</p>
<p>It must begin to try to understand the logic behind them and assess the systemic risks that their superp position and resonance might trigger. Steady development remains the constant. But this development must include the ability to cope with these increasingly bizarre and global challenges. The accumulation of knowledge and the construction of defenses have never been more urgent. An invisible hand is slowly lifting a corner of the world&#x27;s veil, revealing not a beautiful scene, but a bottomless, writhing darkness.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 07. Echoes of the ice field. The bizarre rumors about the perafrost wasteland were like another pebble thrown into the deep waters of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. Although their veracity was questionable and their origins unclear, in this sensitive period of frequent anomalies, any extraordinary rumors deserve to be observed. Lynmo did not immediately invest resources in an in-depth investigation of that remote frigid land, but instead listed it as a high-risisk area for anomalies to be observed, incorporating it into the routine screening scope of the intelligence network.</p>
<p>His attention remained primarily focused on those more direct and urgent threats and changes. Leeway&#x27;s team has made substantial progress in digesting and applying the risk assessment model framework of Dragon Soul. Unable to obtain core data to fill in the model, they creatively utilize the framework&#x27;s logical structure to deduce several key missing data lists which are considered indispensable for assessing the risks of any interaction with the ancient system. The list includes but is not limited to specific energy conduction thresholds for different types of energy patterns, redundancy and failure transfer functions of safety buffer nodes and trigger conditions and cool down times for the systems global reset mechanism. Although we dy know the answer, we now have a clear understanding of what the problems are and how important they are.</p>
<p>Dot. When Leewi reported to Linmo, he had the clarity and excitement that researchers have when facing complex problems. We have compiled this list of key missing data and our rededuction of the window event chain based on the framework logic into a summary of technical inquiries and scenario deductions and sent it back as in-depth feedback on the dragon soul model framework dot. This feedback was no longer a simple exchange of observations but a question that touched upon the core dilemma of dragon soul research. It demonstrated the depth of Mo Yuinga&#x27;s understanding of the framework and also subtly pointed out the potential blind spots in Dragon Souls existing research that may have accumulated a large number of phenomena and data, but they are also struggling to build a unified theory and extract key parameters.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls response slowed. Clearly, this crucial feedback required time to digest and internally discuss. A few days later, Xiao Ji Gang replied with a brief letter stating only that, &quot;Your insights are profound and have been forwarded to the relevant research department for in-depth discussion without providing any new information or commitments.&quot; The technical dialogue seemed to have entered a brief plateau with both sides digesting the existing exchange and assessing the next steps. Meanwhile, Sue Chian&#x27;s work on building the ecological disturbance risk assessment submodel encountered even greater difficulties. The lack of fundamental data on biological neurohysiological responses to specific energy frequencies made any quantitative assessment virtually impossible.</p>
<p>She then adopted a more roundabout approach, extensively collecting and organizing recent reports of abnormal marine biological events from various regions, attempting to conduct cluster analysis from multiple dimensions such as time, space, species type, and abnormal behavioral characteristics to find possible patterns. This work is tedious and complex, but preliminary analysis shows that these events are not entirely random. Although they are widely distributed spatially, there appears to be a slight trend in time starting from a window event and spreading outwards. More importantly, historical environmental monitoring data painstakingly collected by Moyuan from records of past caravans and data from scattered observation stations in the sea areas where the anomalous events occurred show that in the period leading up to the events. The background infrasound and extremely low frequency electromagnetic noise levels in these areas generally exhibited a slight increase beyond normal fluctuations.</p>
<p>This could be indirect evidence. Sue Chanchian pointed out at the analysis report meeting, indicating that the energy disturbances caused by the window event may have a much larger impact range than we directly observe and that they spread and accumulate in the marine environment in a very covert and slow manner. When they accumulate to a certain level or encounter specific environmental conditions or biological sensitive periods, they may trigger the sudden group behavior disorder that we see. This is a chronic systemic environmental stress. This conclusion elevates the phenomenon of marine life going berserk from an isolated tale to an early sign of a potential global ecological crisis.</p>
<p>The severity of which weighed heavily on the minds of all attendees. The outline of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base in a remote sea area gradually became clear thanks to Chandwood&#x27;s costly and secret reconnaissance. It wasn&#x27;t the heavily guarded fortress he had imagined, but rather a large-scale, highly specialized, and almost fully automated research and energy harvesting complex. Using high-powered telescopes and long range photography equipment, reconnaissance personnel captured images from high altitude observation point dozens of nautical miles away using a specially designed tether balloon. The base was built on a mid ocean ridge with active geothermal activity and contained a dense array of oddly shaped tidal converters and pipelines extending deep into geothermal wells.</p>
<p>At the center of the base were several low streamlined silver gray buildings with few people visible, but small unmanned vehicles occasionally move between the facilities. They are quietly working on infrastructure construction and energy reserves and they&#x27;re moving very quickly and with extremely high efficiency. Chin Duodo commented, &quot;It seems that they will not take any external action in the short term, but once completed, the energy and technological resources they can mobilize will be considerable. Their goal is probably not simply self-sufficiency.&quot; The internal breathing aura phenomenon in the southwestern Misty Bay appeared twice more, still without any pattern, and each time it was weaker and shorter, as if the massive construct was entering a low power hibernation or deep selfch check state. Surveillance from the outside detected no personnel or supplies entering or leaving.</p>
<p>The sea area was eerily silent. Just as Mo Yuan Pavilion was busy sorting through this chaotic information and trying to piece together the overall picture, a new and more impactful piece of intelligence accompanied by a huge cost was delivered to Linmo. Chandwood&#x27;s most capable and deeply hidden senior intelligence agent was exposed when he tried to get close to the outer supply chain of the Dragon Soul Project and paid the price with his life. However, in his last moment, he uses life to convey a fragmented but thrilling message. Information reveals that Dragon Souls probe project is far more extensive and sophisticated than previously imagined.</p>
<p>They not only constructed new deep sea submersibles, but also secretly modified three large icebreaker mother ships to serve as mobile forward bases and command centers. Most alarmingly, intelligence fragments suggest that Dragon Soul obtained a critical guiding object through an unorthodox channel. Specific details are unclear, but implied that this object can resonate stably with the depths of the ice flows and appears to have been pre-processed, making the resonance risk manageable. Dragon Soul plans to use this object during the next window of opportunity to attempt to establish a preliminary low power directional energy link with the goal of reading surface information flows and verifying the system state model. They found another key and it might be a safer and more effective key.</p>
<p>Leeway almost cried out after seeing the intelligence pre-processing. Could it be that a third party force has already mastered the technology to safely use this key and they&#x27;ve given it to Dragon Soul? Is it the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood or Vera&#x27;s team? This intelligence struck them like a boulder thrown into a still lake. Far from being deterred by the window incident, Dragon Soul, having obtained the new key, prepared for a more ambitious and inevitably riskier proactive contact. If they succeeded, they might gain groundbreaking insights into the ancient system. But if they failed, the chain reaction could far exceed that of the last time.</p>
<p>The intelligence source paid with their life, and its accuracy requires crossverification with other information. Lynmo&#x27;s voice remained calm, but his eyes flashed with a sharp light. Chandu Duo, use all backup and emergency channels at all costs to verify three things. First, the specific form and source of the Dragon Soul New. Second, the specific technical solutions and security measure for their planned establishment of an energy link.</p>
<p>Third, the precise timing of the next window of opportunity. These are our current top intelligence priorities. He turned to the others. Internal research will be temporarily redirected. Leewei Suchian, you two concentrate your efforts on simulating and deducing the system response spectrum that a low power directional energy link might trigger as well as various possible failure modes and consequences based on all existing knowledge about the icebreaking zone system, energy patterns, and safety buffers.</p>
<p>Sure. How check all our remote monitoring equipment to ensure that we can cover a wider frequency and energy range during the next window period, paying particular attention to monitoring any weak signals that might be characteristic of a directional link. Rumors about the perafrost wasteland have yet to be cleared up. The shadow of mutations in deep sea creatures continues to spread. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is silently gathering strength in the distance.</p>
<p>The behemoths of the southwest are temporarily lying dormant, and the dragon soul is about to drop a stone that could shake the entire world beneath the northernized plains. The world&#x27;s echoes have not yet subsided, and a new proactive question is about to rise. The Mo Yuan Pavilion is caught in a complex force field created by multiple parties, unable to remain aloof or stop any one of them. All they can do is observe more intently, strive to understand more diligently, and grow faster. They pray that when the echoes from beneath the ice plains return, they will have sufficient knowledge and preparation to discern the meaning of those sounds and determine their own course.</p>
<p>The come at the eye of the storm may already be counting down. Chapter 108. Keys and choices. The fragmented information obtained at the cost of a senior intelligence officer&#x27;s life burned like a red-hot iron into the hearts of everyone in the Mo Yuan pavilion. The dragon&#x27;s soul not only did not back down, but was secretly planning an even more invasive exploration and might even have obtained a more secure key.</p>
<p>The authenticity and details of this information directly relate to the future course of the situation and even the safety of the entire sea area. Overwhelmed by grief and pressure, Chin Duo Duo activated several long, dormant, high-cost intelligence lines. The most crucial of these was a contact with an undercover agent code named Nighthawk. This individual held a key position in a secondary logistics hub within Dragon Soul. His identity concealed.</p>
<p>He was one of Chindwood&#x27;s early one-way contact agents. Activating him meant this card would be completely exposed. But at this moment, there was no time to worry about anything else. The instructions were transmitted through a complex deadmail system and coded messages. At all costs, investigate the nature, origin, and security core of the new key scheme.</p>
<p>Priority: top secret. During the anxious days of waiting for the Nighthawks reply, the Muan Pavilion, based on the available information, launched intensive simulations and preparations. Leewi and Sue Chanhan temporarily set aside other research and devoted themselves to simulating the system response that low power directional energy link might trigger. Using the Dragon Souls risk assessment framework as the backbone, they filled in known characteristics of the shattered eye zone system, echo characteristics, inferences about the function of the safety texture, signs of the reset mechanism, as well as parameters from the failure of the wings of freedom case as references for the danger boundary, and constructed multiple simulation scenarios with different key characteristics, link, strength, and duration of action. The simulation results are worrying.</p>
<p>In all simulations, once the link is established, regardless of its power, it triggers a detectable response from the target system. The only difference lies in the strength and nature of the response. In the most optimistic scenario, assuming a perfect key match and an extremely restrained link, the system may only respond with an encrypted status code or authentication request. However, even slight mishaps such as a minor flaw in the key, the link power exceeding a critical threshold or an excessively long duration can trigger consequences ranging from error warning feedback to local security node overload. And ultimately, regional defense countermeasures or system denial of reset.</p>
<p>The key lies in the purity of that key and the precision with which the dragon soul controls the link process. Leeway pointed to the summary chart of simulation results. If their key is indeed pre-processed and the resonance risk is controllable as the intelligence says and their technology can achieve subsecond power fine-tuning and instantaneous interruption, then theoretically it is possible to obtain some information within the safety boundaries. However, any minor error in any link could lead to a repeat of the same mistake. And because this is a directional link, it could even trigger a more concentrated and stronger countermeasure.</p>
<p>Dot. Such Chanchian is more concerned about the potential environmental spillover effects. Even if the link itself is strictly controlled, the energy redistribution and response processes it triggers within the system may be like a pebble thrown into a deep pool, producing secondary fluctuations that our current models cannot fully simulate. These fluctuations propagating through geological structures or water bodies may disturb the energy balance of a wider area exacerbate existing ecological disturbances and may even awaken other dormant units. Sherhow&#x27;s defensive preparations were more pragmatic.</p>
<p>He not only inspected all monitoring equipment, but also organized an emergency evacuation drill simulating a sudden highintensity energy pulse or infrasound impact. The drill required all non-critical personnel to enter designated specially reinforced underground shelters or ship cabins with a certain level of electromagnetic shielding as quickly as possible and critical personnel were required to master the skills to maintain basic operations and communications under strong interference. The drill revealed some bottlenecks in evacuation routes and deficiencies in some shielding facilities which were quickly recorded and rectified. Several more days passed in the intense preparation. Finally, the first encrypted report from Nighthawk was delivered to Chandu Duo through an unexpected channel of everyday items.</p>
<p>The report was still fragmented, but the information was extremely valuable. Regarding the new key, Dragon Soul did indeed acquire an item described as a dark blue spindle-shaped crystal, neither gold nor stone, about the length of a palm with a slowly flowing cloud-like halo inside. The origin of this item is extremely confidential. Even the Nighthawk level cannot access it. It was only learned from extremely rare fragments of highle conversations, seemingly related to an accidental discovery during an early exploration of ruins and subsequent long-term secret research and was only recently re-evaluated and activated.</p>
<p>The crystal is stored in a speciallymade container with multiple energy shields, and its transportation and activation are subject to extremely strict procedures. Regarding the link scheme, Project Dragon Soul utilizes a specialized device called a resonance probe capable of emitting highly pure composite acoustic beams with precisely tunable frequency and waveform. The core of the scheme involves first using a low power broadband scan to confirm the optimal resonant frequency between the key crystal and the target region and then establishing an extremely narrow band strictly programmed directional energy link at this frequency. The entire linking process is planned in multiple phases, each lasting only a very short time, milliseconds. Each phase is immediately interrupted for system feedback assessment, and the next phase only proceeds after safety is confirmed.</p>
<p>The scheme mentions several real-time monitoring indicators and preset interruption thresholds, which does appear to indicate that risk control has been considered. Regarding the next window of opportunity, nightshade provide a more precise time frame approximately 19 to 23 days later lasting about 36 hours. This largely matches Leewi&#x27;s calculations based on astronomical and ocean title data. The key is a cloud-like halo inside the crystal. Leeway pondered.</p>
<p>This description is not exactly the same as any of the ancient artifacts we have obtained before, but spindle shape and internal halo are vaguely mentioned in some ancient legends and scattered records about the storage or conversion medium of top level energy dot. Their technical solution sounds very cautious, a typical step-by-step verification and rapid response approach. Sue Chenin commented, &quot;But the problem is, are their evaluation criteria for system feedback accurate? Can those interruption thresholds really take effect before the systems countermeasures are formed? These are all unknowns. Lynn Mo carefully read through each report and every deduction result. The Dragon Souls actions were like a meticulously designed scientific experiment conducted on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>The experimenters believe they had mastered enough theory, tools, and safety ropes. But the subject of the experiment was an ancient being full of unknowns possibly possessing defense mechanisms far beyond comprehension. Cross compare all the technical details about the key and linkage scheme transmitted back by Nighthawk with the various risk scenarios we have deduced. Linmo instructed Leeway and Sue Shian identify any potential risks in their scheme that have not been adequately addressed or any assumptions that we believe are insufficiently supported by evidence. compiled them into a supplementary risk notice.</p>
<p>He looked at Shien Duo Duo notify Nighthawk that his mission is complete. He should immediately enter a silent stealthy state and not be contacted unless it is a matter of life and death. His safety is the top priority. Finally, Lynn Mo&#x27;s gaze swept over the solemn faces of everyone in the command room. We will not intervene, nor will we stop, nor are we able to stop the dragon souls actions.</p>
<p>But we must be fully prepared to observe, record, and analyze the entire process of this operation. This may be an unprecedented opportunity for us to understand the operating logic of the ancient system and assess the limits of human intervention. He paused, his tone low and firm. Notify all units that during the Dragon Soul window period operation, the Mo Yuon Pavilion will enter the highest level of silent observation. All external activities are suspended and energy radiation is reduced to the minimum.</p>
<p>We must be like a real reef blending into the background, using all our eyes and ears to clearly see this dance on the edge of a cliff. The key is in hand. The choice has been made. The dragon soul is about to knock on that ancient door. Whether the response from behind the door is knowledge, warning, or a torrent of destruction, the Mo Yuan Pavilion must see every glimmer of light shining through the crack.</p>
<p>Hear every soft creek of the hinges turning. This observation itself is the most precious capital necessary for survival in this increasingly bizarre and dangerous world. The storm is coming, and this time they may be able to see its true shape. Chapter 1 09. Observing from the edge.</p>
<p>The precise time window of the dragon&#x27;s soul probe operation like the sword of Damocles hovers over a specific mark on the calendar. Its invisible pressure meticulously adjusting the rhythm of every gear in the Mo Yuan pavilion. Only 7 days remain until the operation begins. Following Linmo&#x27;s instructions, the entire Moan Pavilion has switched to the highest level of silent observation mode. All non-essential energy consuming facilities have been shut down or reduced to minimum maintenance levels.</p>
<p>Nighttime lighting control is strict to the point of being harsh and even everyday cooking smoke has undergone special treatment to reduce its heat signature. The island is like a colossal beast that has concealed all its presence and lurks in the shadows with only countless eyes and ears silently opening in the darkness aimed at the north and southwest. After integrating the details of the key crystal and resonance probe scheme transmitted back by Nighthawk, Leeway and Sue Chanchan simulation work entered the final calibration and risk point extraction stage. They discovered that the theoretical basis of several key safety thresholds and interruption conditions preset in the dragon soul scheme likely heavily relied on the assumptions of linear response and predictable delay of ancient systems. But based on our analysis of the window event, the chain reaction of the system as internal security network when stimulated by a specific stimulus may be highly nonlinear and instantaneous.</p>
<p>Leeway pointed to a peak graph in the simulation results. In other words, the system may not react linearly in order of detection processing response, but rather trigger a preset almost immediately effective defense protocol the instant the energy input reaches a certain critical point. The millisecond level interruption of the dragon soul project may still be too slow in the face of a real system response. Such an raised another concern from the perspective of energy conduction medium. Their solution mainly considers the propagation and attenuation of sound waves and seawater and ice layers, but ignores the fact that when energy links are established, they may directly couple to deeper geological structures or global energy networks through the crystal itself or internal system pathways.</p>
<p>Once such deep coupling is formed, it may not be able to be cut off by a simple interruption. It will be like a needle inserted into a blood vessel. Even if it is pulled out, the effect have already occurred. They compiled these two core risks along with several other minor but significant technical details into a rigorously worded and logically clear document titled potential nonlinearity questions and deep coupling risk warnings regarding directed energy links which they sent to Dragon Soul as a supplementary risk warning. This warning was no longer merely an observational conclusion, but a deep critique based on technical principles directly addressing the theoretical foundation of Dragon Souls action plan.</p>
<p>They knew this warning might go unanswered or spark heated debate within Dragon Soul. But it was a voice that Emo Yuan Pavilion as a technical observer had to raise driven by moral considerations and their own safety. Even after the Nighthawk fell silent, Chindwood&#x27;s intelligence network did not slack in its external information gathering efforts. Instead, it became more passive and covert. He utilized several publicly available information collection channels disguised as natural phenomenon monitoring or commercial data statistics, cross- refferencing abnormal signals from the automatic identification system, AI is of ships in the northern seas, specific weather disturbance patterns on satellite cloud images, and even anomalous signal fragments accidentally overheard by amateur radio enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Piecing together indirect evidence of the Dragon Soul fleet movements. Based on information from various sources, Dragon Souls three modified Icebreaker mother ships and their escort fleet have quietly arrived at their designated positions outside the ice flow zone and begun final system integration and testing. Their operations are exceptionally discreet, maintaining strict radio silence and relying primarily on lasers and data links for internal communication. They have also deployed a considerable number of underwater sonar arrays and anti-detection buoys attempting to envelop the entire operational area in an information blackbox. They danti want anyone to know exactly what happened including potential allies or saboturs and duo duo judged.</p>
<p>This shows that they themselves are not entirely confident about the outcome of the operation and have prepared for the worst case scenario of secrecy. The southwestern misty bay remained deathly silent. The occasional dark red aura of light seemed to have vanished completely as if the massive structure had truly entered a deep hibernation. However, the monitoring equipment deployed at a greater distance by the Mo Yuon pavilion, targeting extremely lowfrequency magnetic fields and changes in gravitational gradients recorded a persistent extremely weak but stable background noise in the direction of the bay. Unlike any known natural geomagnetic disturbance or tidal effect, the source characteristics of this noise have not yet been analyzed, but is like a perpetually unhealing minute wound, continuously oozing anomalies from the skin of the environment.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s remote energy base appears to be in its final construction phase. Recent footage taken remotely from a high altitude balloon shows the silver gray building complex at the base&#x27;s center largely complete. With the surrounding tidal and geothermal energy harvesting arrays nearing completion, the foundations of what appear to be large energy storage units, possibly giant capacitor banks or flywheels, can even be seen being hoisted. The entire base remains sparssely populated and boasts an astonishingly high level of automation. After disappearing from the atal lagoon, Vera&#x27;s team has not appeared at any known monitoring points, as if they have completely blended into the seam mist.</p>
<p>Time passed day by day in a stifling silence. With only 3 days remaining until the start of Operation Dragon Soul, a final islandwide redundancy test of the communication and command systems was conducted within Mo Yuan Pavilion. This ensured that in the event of a primary communication network outage due to unknown energy interference or physical damage, backup and emergency communication methods, including buried wired signal lines, fixpoint laser communication, and even trained carrier pigeons, could maintain basic command links and critical data transmission. Simultaneously, all personnel in key positions were clearly defined regarding autonomous action guidelines and final rendevous points in the event of a loss of contact. Sherhow personally inspected the concealment and survival supplies of each observation point.</p>
<p>These observation points were mostly located on remote islands and reefs, hidden caves, or even camouflaged floating platforms. Personnel would need to remain there for days on end, enduring loneliness and harsh environments just to capture signals that might be fleeting. They were the nerve endings of the Mo Yuan Pavilion reaching into the distance, fragile yet crucial. On the eve of the operation, Lin Mo convened a final meeting with core members to discuss the situation. We cannot predict what will happen starting tomorrow at Lin MOS gaze swept over everyone.</p>
<p>Dragon Solless operation may succeed. It may fail or may trigger a chain reaction that we cannot foresee at all. Our mission is not to intervene, but to observe, record, and understand as much as possible. He pulled up the latest comprehensive situation map. Leewi Sue Chian, you lead the analysis team to guard the underground command center on the main island, responsible for processing all data transmitted from the observation points in real time, conducting preliminary analysis and risk warnings.</p>
<p>Sure. How you&#x27;re in charge of the ground defense command post to ensure the safety of the island itself and also serve as the emergency support hub for all observation points. Chen Duo Duo you are responsible for summarizing screening and conducting preliminary analysis of all intelligence information to ensure the smooth and accurate flow of information at all observation points. Once the operation begins the sole task will be recording an encrypted data transmission. Any active detection or signal transmission is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>If any exposure risk is detected or an insurmountable danger is encountered. Evacuation must be carried out immediately according to the pre-arranged plan with the safety of personnel as the top priority. He paused, his tone grave. This observation may reveal a deeper truth about this world or it may confront unimaginable dangers, but only by seeing clearly can we know which path to take in the future. Everyone take your positions.</p>
<p>The meeting ended, and everyone left silently to their respective posts. Under the cover of night, Mayuin Pavilion resembled a ghost island on high alert, yet devoid of any fire, with only the faint sound of the sea breeze rustling through the rocks and buildings. Lynn Emmo climbed alone to the top of the reinforced observation tower, which had undergone special electromagnetic shielding. Here, the view was expansive, the instruments were complete, and it had a separate hardwired connection to the underground command center. here along with the entire Mo Yuan pavilion.</p>
<p>He would witness and record this knocking on the door experiment taking place beneath the distant ice plains, an experiment that could potentially determine the future. In the northern night sky, the stars were dim as if obscured by the omen of the impending energy disturbance. To the southwest, thick fog persisted, and the silence was like a graveyard. To the east and south, vast seas stretched into the night, seemingly calm, yet concealing the continued disruption of biological rhythms and unknown environmental pressures caused by the aftershocks of the window. Mo Yuan Pavilion is like a calm observer standing on the edge of abyss, having adjusted all its telescopes and recording equipment, holding its breath and waiting for the being beneath the abyss to respond to the impending cautious questioning.</p>
<p>The time has finally come to a critical point. Observation is about to begin. Chapter 1 10 echoes beneath the ice. Time flowed exceptionally slowly in the absolute silence and focused waiting. The timers at all the observation points of Moon Pavilion were synchronously counting down to the millisecond with the estimated start time of the window period provided by the Dragon Soul as the origin.</p>
<p>Northern region outside the icebreak zone. Dragon Souls three modified icebreaker mother ships, like three steel icebergs, were anchored in a triangular formation in the sparsely populated sea. All unnecessary lights on the holes were turned off, leaving only the eerie blue glow of the instrument panel in the command bridge, and a few faint signals outside the holes to prevent collisions. The massive holes remained motionless in the polar winds, exuding a solemn, poised readiness. Underwater, a complex sonar array and a network of monitoring buoys had already been deployed like an invisible net covering the bottomless dark chasm ahead.</p>
<p>The personnel from Miuan Pavilion, stationed at two concealed observation points in the north, huddled in specially designed insulated shelters dressed in white camouflage suits that blended seamlessly into the icy environment. on the screens in front of them. Data streams from passive receiver arrays pulseed background noise spectrum, hydrophone vibration waveforms, magnetic field strength variation curves. Everything appeared calm, but everyone held their breath, their fingertips hovering over the emergency recording and alarm buttons. In the underground command center, Leewi, Sue Chian, and several core analysts stared intently at the main screen.</p>
<p>The screen was divided into dozens of sections displaying real-time data from different frequency bands and monitoring methods, as well as simulation curves of several response models preset based on the Dragon Souls possible action patterns. The air seemed to freeze with only the extremely low hum of the equipment&#x27;s cooling fans. 10 minutes until the estimated start time, an analyst whispered. Lynn Mo&#x27;s voice calmly transmitted to every key position via internal hardwire communication. All units, finalize equipment status.</p>
<p>Maintain absolute silence. Time was ticking away. 9 minutes 5 minutes 2 minutes. About 30 seconds before the countdown reached zero. On the main screen of the northern number one observation point, a very subtle ripple appeared on the waveform representing the passive sonar array.</p>
<p>This ripple was completely different from any natural background fluctuation. A group of composite soundwave pulses with highly pure frequency and precisely controlled intensity and extremely low level like a cautious tentacle probed into the deep sea where the rift was located from the direction of the dragon soul fleet. The probe beam has been launched. Leeway lowered his voice, a sharp glint in his eyes. They have begun the first phase, a broadband scan to confirm the resonant frequency on the waveform.</p>
<p>The spectral characteristics of that group of sound pulses changed rapidly, clearly indicating a rapid frequency scan. After about 15 seconds, the scan stopped and all the energy quickly converged and concentrated into an extremely narrow frequency band. The frequency value of that point was automatically captured and highlighted by the device, a complex and non- integer frequency value. yet carrying an eerie sense of harmony. Resonant frequency locked.</p>
<p>Now Leeway clenched his fist. Almost instantly after the frequency was locked, the monitoring data changed dramatically. The magnetic field reading in the direction of the ice flow showed its first clear and regular fluctuation, perfectly synchronized with the intensity change of the directional sound beam. The underwater audio device also detected an echo from deep within a crevice with the same frequency as the external sound beam but seemingly modulated in some complex way. This echo was not a simple reflection.</p>
<p>Its waveform contains subtle difficult to decipher structures superimposed on it. Link established. Energy coupling confirmed. Such an stared at the rapidly refreshing energy flow analysis data on another screen. The coupling efficiency is astonishingly high.</p>
<p>That crystal key is working. The atmosphere in the underground command center instantly became extremely tense. Dragon Soul had indeed successfully established a low power directional link. Now, the key question was how long this link could be maintained and how the system would respond. The link lasted for about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Then, the intensity of the external sound beam abruptly dropped to Zero Dragon&#x27;s soul. as planned, executed its first millisecond level interruption. Almost simultaneously, the magnetic field disturbance and echo signal in the direction of the rift also disappeared as if everything that had just happened was merely an illusion. Phase 1 security disruption, the analyst reported the target system response matches the initial characteristics of authentication request simulation scenario A3. No signs of overload or countermeasures were detected.</p>
<p>A suppressed sigh of relief filled the command center. The first step seemed to have been successful. After a brief pause, the Dragon Soul began its second phase. This time, the power of the directional sound beam was slightly increased, but still strictly controlled below the theoretical safety threshold, and the duration was extended to approximately 0.3 seconds. The link was reestablished and the waveform structure of the system echo became more complex as if transmitting a longer information packet.</p>
<p>However, less than a second after the connection was interrupted, an anomaly occurred in the direction of the ice shard area, the passive monitoring array captured an extremely brief but far stronger broadband pulse burst than any of the previous echoes. This pulse burst did not originate from the depths of the fissure, but rather seemed to be excited simultaneously from certain specific locations on the sidewall of the fissure. The pulse lasted for less than 100th of a second before disappearing into the background noise, but its instantaneous energy peak caused the alarm lights on the monitoring equipment to flash wildly for half a second. What is that? Sukianken exclamed. It&#x27;s not a proactive response from the system.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s more like a state refresh or selfch checkck pulse from a security node because the energy input from the link triggered some internal threshold. Leeway&#x27;s face turned pale as he quickly retrieved the spectral details of the pulse burst. The frequency components are complex containing multiple characteristic frequency points that may be related to the highfrequency transient buffer pattern. Damn it. This is very likely the nonlinear response we warned about before.</p>
<p>Although the link was interrupted, the systems internal security network was alarmed, triggering a chain of instantaneous selfch checks. Almost simultaneously, instruments set up further away by Moon Pavilion to monitor micro vibrations in the Earth&#x27;s crust recorded an extremely slight but clearly identifiable tremor deep beneath the cracks in the icebreaking zone with a tremor pattern unlike any known tectonic earthquake or ice collapse. Dragon Souls operation seemed to have encountered an unexpected setback. The command center&#x27;s communication channels were silent. Everyone awaited Dragon Souls next move.</p>
<p>The Dragon Soul fleet remained silent for a full 5 minutes, much longer than the scheduled interval. Clearly, they had also detected the unusual pulse burst and ground tremors and were conducting an emergency assessment. 5 minutes later, the third phase of the connection attempt began. This time the power of the external sound beam was adjusted to an even lower level than in the first phase and the duration was shortened to the limit seemingly becoming unusually cautious. The link was established and the echo reappeared but this time the waveform of the echo showed obvious distortion and delay as if the internal response path of the system had been interfered with or blocked.</p>
<p>The link was interrupted in a very short time. At the very moment of interruption, a sudden change occurred. The broadband pulse burst that had subsided suddenly reappeared. This time with even greater intensity and longer duration than the first one. Even more frighteningly, the source of the pulse burst no longer seemed to be confined to the sidewalls of the fracture, but began to rapidly propagate along some invisible path into the deeper parts of the fracture and into the lateral ice and rock straighta.</p>
<p>A chain reaction of network overload. Leeway suddenly stood up. They&#x27;re trying to soothe the system with lower power, but that might have triggered a deeper fault diagnosis protocol. The system thinks it&#x27;s under continuous lowintensity penetration attack and is initiating a wider range of internal selfch checks and isolation procedures. The monitoring data began to trigger a full-scale alarm.</p>
<p>The magnetic field disturbances became violent and chaotic. The water temperature gradient along the cracks fluctuated abnormally, and even tiny bubbles began to seep out from the ice cracks. Further away, the equipment set up by Mayuan Pavilion to monitor ultra- low frequency environmental noise captured a deep suppressed humming sound seemingly originating from the depths of the earth, which was slowly increasing in intensity. The energy link must be permanently terminated. Immediately, Su Chian shouted into the communicator.</p>
<p>Even though she knew the dragon soul couldn&#x27;t hear her, as of hearing her thoughts, the dragon soul fleet ceased, emitting any more directional sound beams. They clearly realized the situation was spiraling out of control and decisively stopped all active probing. However, the system, which had been awakened, did not seem to calm down immediately. The abnormal pulse bursts, ground tremors, and low-frequency humming continued, although their intensity was slowly decreasing, but at a much slower rate than expected. The entire ice fragmentation zone seemed to have transformed from sleeping giant into a restless patient, tossing and turning, uttering painful ramblings.</p>
<p>The observation points at Mouan Pavilion faithfully recorded all of this. The data stream like a burst dam surged towards the underground command center. New fine signs of stress crack propagation were recorded inside the ice layer. Water chemical composition monitoring shows that the concentrations of iron silicon and various rare metal ions are abnormally elevated at the Fiser outlet. The ambient infrasound background noise level increased by 15 dibels and a stable low frequency modulation was observed.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls knocking on the door experiment seems to have ended prematurely in a way that was both successful and disastrous. They may have obtained some valuable initial handshake data, but they undoubtedly seriously disturbed the target and triggered a series of unknown and potentially lasting stress responses within the system. Lynn and Mo stood on the top floor of the observation tower, looking up at the gloomy northern sky through the special glass. Although he couldn&#x27;t see anything with a naked eye, he could sense that beneath that frozen sea, some ancient and enormous being had partially awakened and was examining this world that had dared to disturb it in its own way. The echo beneath the ice has already resounded.</p>
<p>What this echo will bring, no one knows. The observation records of Mo Yuan Pavilion now hold the only and most crucial key to understanding this unexpected dialogue and its consequences. The wind seems to have grown colder. Chapter 111. The aftermath.</p>
<p>The dragon souls knocking on the door experiment came to an abrupt end after triggering a series of unsettling stress responses from the ancient systems in the shattered ice zone. Like a boulder thrown into a deep pool, the ripples did not immediately subside as the stone sank. Instead, they began to spread in all directions in a more complex and subtle way. Even after the operation concluded, Mo Yuan Pavilion maintained a 3-day period of maximum level silent observation. Data transmitted from various observation points in the north clearly showed that the anomalies in the direction of the icebreak zone had not subsided rapidly.</p>
<p>Although the broadband pulses triggered by the internal security network chain reaction no longer erupted, the environmental magnetic field and water disturbances remained in a state of continuous fluctuation above baseline levels. The concentration of special ions seeping from the fissures remained high, and the stress cracks inside the ice layer after their initial rapid expansion seemed to have entered a slow but continuous creep phase. Most unsettlingly, the low-pitched humming sound originating from the ground, although its intensity had greatly decreased, persisted stubbornly like background noise, sometimes strong and sometimes weak, like a disturbed giant unconsciously grinding its teeth in its sleep. The system has not been completely reset. That leeway stared at the compiled 72-hour data trenchart, his voice horse.</p>
<p>Or rather, its reset process is much longer than we imagined, and it may have left some after effects. Those persistent anomalies may be the self-regulation process after the internal energy balance was disrupted, or it may be that some kind of low-level alert state has been activated. Such Chanchchan added, &quot;Biom monitoring data also shows that the activity rhythms of plankton and deep sea fish in a large area around the ice flow have become significantly disrupted and their migration paths have become chaotic. This is similar to the biological anomaly pattern after the window event, but the scope and duration of the impact seemed to be even greater. That key crystal and directional link may have left a more profound imprint.</p>
<p>After confirming that there were no immediate external threats targeting the Mo Yuan Pavilion, Lynn Mo ordered the lifting of the highest level of silence and the restoration of level two alert, but all observation points continued to maintain 24/7 monitoring. A massive stream of data began to be analyzed more deeply and systematically in the underground command center. At the same time, Chindwood&#x27;s intelligence network also began to make every effort to capture the aftershocks caused by this incident. Dragon Souls reaction was the most direct. After the operation was halted, their fleet did not immediately withdraw.</p>
<p>Instead, they further strengthened the blockade around the ice shards and began deploying a large number of new monitoring buoys with complex antenna rays, seemingly eager to comprehensively monitor the situation and collect after effect data. Unconfirmed reports suggest that this half success half out of control operation sparked heated debate within Dragon Soul with a conflict between radical and cautious factions becoming public. However, Dragon Soul officially remained absolutely silent, issuing no statements as if everything that happened in the ice shards those days was merely an illusion. However, this silence itself was a strong signal. All the major powers, those with even a modicum of intelligence, noticed the unusual energy disturbances in the northern seas and the dragon souls unusually large-scale mobilization and blockade.</p>
<p>Rumors began to breed and spread at an alarming rate. The ancient beings of the perpetually frozen wasteland have been awakened by the dragon soul and are gathering their power in preparation for revenge. The dragon&#x27;s soul stole forbidden knowledge from the ruins, but in doing so, it also incurred the guardian&#x27;s curse. Beneath the shattered ice zone isn&#x27;t a ruin at all, but a door to an unknown dimension that the dragon&#x27;s soul almost opened. Various bizarre and exaggerated versions circulated among lower level survivors and smaller factions, causing a degree of panic and speculation.</p>
<p>Although the top factions might not believe these rumors, they undoubtedly exacerbated the already tense and suspicious atmosphere. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was one of the first external forces to react substantially. The day after Mo Yuan Pavilion observed the anomaly spreading in the ice crushing zone, Chindwood&#x27;s informants discovered that the construction of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s remote energy base had suddenly slowed with the installation of some peripheral tidal energy harvesting arrays even halted. Simultaneously, they were urgently acquiring high precision environmental radiation monitoring instruments and long-term geomagnetic anomaly recording and analysis services through various clandestine channels at inflated prices, clearly strengthening their ability to monitor changes in the overall energy environment. They were also frightened.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo analyzed the outcome of Dragon&#x27;s Soulless actions exceeded their expectations. What they&#x27;re most concerned about now is probably not their own energy project, but what kind of global environmental chain reaction will be brought about by the disturbance of the ancient system and whether it will affect their own long-term plans. The southwestern Misty Bay remains shrouded in deathly silence. But the remote magnetic field and gravity gradient monitoring equipment deployed by Mo Yuan Pavilion detected an extremely faint new change amidst the persistent background noise. The rhythm of the noise seemed to be beginning to resonate or follow in some indescribable nonlinear way with the faint low humming coming from the direction of the distant ice flows.</p>
<p>Although so faint as to be almost submerged in a margin of error, this discovery sent a chill down the spines of everyone in the know. Is that construct still passively receiving something? Or is its dormant state itself reacting to this global change in energy background? Vera&#x27;s team remains silent as if they have completely vanished into thin air. After combining the results of internal data analysis with external intelligence feedback, Lynn Mo convened a core meeting. The situation is clear now. Lin Mo&#x27;s tone was calm, yet carried a cold clarity that saw through the complexities of the situation.</p>
<p>The Dragon Souls adventure has disrupted a fragile balance. The ancient system is not an inanimate object. It possesses complex self-maintenance and defense mechanisms and its influence may extend far beyond a single relic. Now a part of it has been activated existing in an unstable sub-healthy state. This state itself and the environmental chain reaction it may trigger will become a new variable that all forces must face in the near future.</p>
<p>He pointed to the chart. Dragon Soul has swallowed the bitter fruit of its own adventure, and in the short term, it is probably neither able nor willing to conduct large-scale exploration again. Instead, it will focus on monitoring and assessing the damage. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood has been forced to adjust its pace and strengthen environmental monitoring, which may delay or change its strategic intentions. The situation of the wings of Liberty remnants is unclear, but the potential connection between its construct and the global energy background makes it an unpredictable risk point for us.</p>
<p>Lin MOS gaze swept over everyone. This means that our previously relatively clear role as observers needs to be adjusted. We are no longer just observing the actions of a certain site or a certain force, but we need to start observing and responding to a changing global energy environment system and the chain reactions it triggers. Leeway Sue Chanchian, your research direction needs to be upgraded again. The focus should shift from understanding specific relics to modeling global energy environment disturbances and their ecological and geological impacts.</p>
<p>Using all the data we have accumulated this time and before try to build a simplified multi-node coupled environmental change early warning model precise prediction is not required but it should be able to identify anomalous patterns and the increasing trend of correlation styo the focus of intelligence gathering also needs to shift reduce the priority of tracking the specific details of the actions of a single force and instead vigorously collect a wide range of reports on abnormal environment enironmental events, changes in geological activity, and abnormalities in biological population behavior around the world, no matter how small or bizarre they may seem. We need to piece together a map of the spread of energy disturbances from these fragments. Sure, how add contingency plans to the defense strategy to deal with gradual environmental degradation, such as the impact of long-term infrasound or abnormal magnetic field exposure on personnel and equipment, as well as possible new types of environmental disasters. He concluded, &quot;The Aftershocks are spreading and the old rules of the game may be being rewritten. A cautious resource inensive approach is still effective, but its meaning must be expanded.</p>
<p>We need to not only stockpile resources, train personnel, and crack technologies, but also learn to understand and adapt to this increasingly unpredictable world that is coming alive. This may be the real key to our long-term survival in this island survival game. The aftershocks continue to spread. Having clearly discerned the shape of the first truly significant storm, the Mo Yuan Pavilion ship began adjusting its ballast and rigging, preparing to continue its voyage in even more turbulent and unpredictable sea conditions. Observation and understanding would become its new and most important sales.</p>
<p>Chapter 112. Environmental Network. Lynn Mo&#x27;s decision to shift the focus to observing the global energy environment system is like adjusting the lookout towers and sonar arrays of the MMO Yuon pavilion ship. The target has a shifted from specific points, relics, forces to abstract yet ubiquitous surfaces, environment, energy fields, ecological disturbances. This requires a higher level of integration capabilities and a broader monitoring perspective.</p>
<p>The internal research began the painful transition. Leewi and Sue Chian temporarily set aside their in-depth investigation of the specific relics such as the Hemlock Island stone slabs and metal fragments and devoted all their energy to building this simplified global environmental disturbance early warning model. This work was more difficult than they had imagined. What they have were fragments of data recorded by the limited observation points of the Muan Pavilion itself before and after several past events. the window event, the dragon soul knocking on the door, plus scattered, vague, and difficult to verify reports of abnormal events from all over the world that she and Duodo could collect.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like trying to piece together a mirror that reflects the entire ocean from a few broken pieces of glass. Leeway said to Lyn, Mo with a rice smile. He and Sue Chian first tried to standardize and parameterize the existing data defining dozens of key environmental indicator variables such as infrasound intensity index in a specific frequency band, regional magnetic field disturbance variance, composite index of abnormal ion concentration in water and biological behavior deviation score. Then using some of the logic from the risk assessment model framework they learned from long hun they attempted to establish a correlation network and influence transmission weights among these variables. The initial model was extremely rudimentary with many functional relationships between variables being purely speculative and the input data was sparse and incomplete.</p>
<p>However, even so, when they used data from window events and knocking events as test cases, the model still captured some meaningful patterns. For example, the peak of energy disturbance often occurred slightly later than a main anthropogenic or natural triggering events and its spatial decay was not a simple concentric circle diffusion but rather showed a trend of directional propagation along certain implicit energy conduction paths which may be related to seafloor geological structures major ocean currents or even atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the occurrence and degree of abnormal biological behavior seem to have some statistical correlation with the product of the variables infrasound intensity in a specific frequency band and variance of magnetic field disturbance. The model is far from predictive, but it is starting to describe and correlate, Sue Chian said, showing the preliminary analysis charts. For example, based on existing data, the energy disturbances of the window event decayed much slower in the southwest than in the east, and more subsequent biological anomalies were detected along the direction of the extended tributaries of the Kroio current.</p>
<p>This may suggest that ocean currents not only carry heat and nutrients, but may also act as a medium for conducting some kind of energy disturbances. Although these preliminary findings are only a rudimentary summary of patterns, they provide a completely new perspective for understanding the propagation of environmental disturbances. Based on this, Leeway proposed that the layout of the existing observation network at Moyuan should be optimized and monitoring points should be added or strengthened at key nodes of the potential energy transfer paths predicted by the models to form a more targeted environmental monitoring network. Lynn Emmo approved the suggestion. Sherhow began organizing a team to secretly deploy simple automated monitoring stations on several selected remote islands or open waters far from the main island but along the model&#x27;s predicted path using existing speedboats and camouflage buoy equipment.</p>
<p>These stations consumed very little power, relying primarily on solar and wave energy and periodically transmitted data via encrypted low-frequency satellite data links modified using rare communication templates obtained through signin. They were like silent sensory cells scattered across the open ocean by the mo yuan pavilion. While the Mayuin Pavilion was busy weaving this invisible environmental perception network, the aftershocks from the outside world evolved into new and more concrete forms. According to the intelligence compiled by Chien Duo Duo after its initial blockade and silence, Dragon Soul seems to have begun to adopt a strategy of limited transparency. They haven&#x27;t released any details of the knocking on the door experiment, but through several semiofficial scientific research exchange channels, they have successfively released academic briefings on the correlation between recent geomagnetic activity anomalies in the Arctic Circle and climate change, as well as preliminary reports on observations of biological adaptation in extreme deep sea environments.</p>
<p>These reports are rigorous in content and solid in data, but cleverly avoid any trace of human intervention. attributing all observed anomalies to fluctuations in natural cycles and complex geoysical processes that require further research. They&#x27;re trying to guide public opinion and provide a scientific and dethreatening explanatory framework for the observed phenomena. Chen Duo analyzed on the one hand they are appeasing internal and external doubts and on the other hand they&#x27;re laying the groundwork for when they may have to disclose more information later. At the same time, the publicly released data itself has become a relatively reliable external data source that our model can site dot.</p>
<p>The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood&#x27;s response was more pragmatic and efficient. While construction of their remote energy base load, it didn&#x27;t stop. Instead, they adjusted the functions of some facilities, transforming several large energy storage units into the basic structure of environmental buffer and isolation chambers. Simultaneously, they procured a large quantity of a special composite material with excellent electromagnetic absorption and mechanical damping properties through black market channels. Seemingly eager to enhance the base&#x27;s ability to withstand fluctuations in the external energy environment.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re fortifying their nest, Chin Duo Duo judged. This shows that they believe the environmental disturbances will not subside in the near future and may even intensify. They have chosen the safest course of action to ensure the absolute security of their core strongholds. First, the most noteworthy changes came from some previously overlooked small and medium-sized factions and scattered survivor groups. As rumors about anomalies, freakish sea monsters, and unpredictable weather intensified, coupled with confirmation from the Dragon Souls semiofficial report, a pervasive anxiety and desire for change began to spread.</p>
<p>Some small settlements near areas with frequent anomaly reports began spontaneously trying various primitive protective measures such as surrounding islands with metal mesh, attempting to shield against abnormal electromagnetic fields, digging deep trenches around their dwellings and filling them with charcoal, attempting to absorb harmful earth energy, and even holding superstitious sacrificial rituals. More settlements located in relatively calm areas began consciously stockpiling more disaster relief supplies and strengthening information sharing among themselves, forming several small regional mutual aid intelligence networks. Panic and spontaneous responses are spreading at the grassroots level. Such Chian looked at the reports on the grassroots trends collected by Chen Duo Duo and felt complicated. Although it is chaotic and inefficient, it shows that ordinary survivors have a direct perception of changes in the environment.</p>
<p>Their survival instincts drive them to take action even if the methods are wrong. Amidst this global undercurrent, an unexpected event brought Mo Yuan G&#x27;s environmental network plan to the forefront. A small caravan with stable but discreet trade relations with the Mo Yuan Pavilion encountered an extremely violent and unpredictable mad dog wave and intense electromagnetic interference while returning to the main route from the Emerald atal in the southeast. The caravan lost one ship and several people were injured. The survivors still shaken sought help at the nearest Mo Yuan Pavilion Trading Post.</p>
<p>According to the captain, the weather was fine and the sea was calm when suddenly waves rose from three different directions without wind, converging into a devastating giant wave. At the same time, all electronic compasses and simple radios malfunctioned instantly, and the ship&#x27;s metal components crackled and flashed with tiny electrical sparks. Chandu Duo personally handled the rescue and resettlement of the caravan and recorded the details of the incident and its location coordinates. He input the coordinates into the environmental model that was being built and leeway and suanchen immediately retrieved the models calculations of recent environmental indicators for the area based on limited data as well as the records of the most recent observation point at Mayuan Pavilion. The model shows that over the past 7 days the magnetic field disturbance variance and infrasound intensity in a specific frequency band indices in this area have been slowly rising.</p>
<p>Although the absolute values are not high, the trend is clear. Leewwayi pointed to the chart and our newly deployed no three buoy monitoring station which is closest to the incident site recorded a brief but significant peak in abnormal ion concentration in the water and a chaotic micropressure wave disturbance about 2 hours before the incident. These signs are logically related to the multidirectional converging waves and electromagnetic interference characteristics described by the caravan in terms of time sequence and phenomenon type. Did the model alarm? Linmo asked, &quot;According to our initial threshold, there are no issues because none of the individual indicators exceeded the limits.&quot; Such Chanchian replied. However, the model cannot currently effectively identify the coordinated anomalies of multiple indicators within a short period of time and a small space.</p>
<p>This event resembles a miniature locally uncontrolled release of environmental energy that did not reach the main transmission path dot. This unexpected incident acted as a catalyst. It proved that the environmental monitoring network being built by Moyuan and the analytical model behind it though rudimentary are on the right track and have already been able to capture subtle signs of real threats. It also highlighted the shortcomings of the current model its weak ability to provide early warnings of multi-indicator anomalies and localized emergencies. Adjust the priority of the model algorithm.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo ordered add identification and weighted alarm logic for multi-indicator spatial co-occurrence and sudden changes in short-term indicators. At the same time, taking this incident as a case, densely deploy monitoring points around the area where the caravan was in distress to form a high sensitivity monitoring network to continuously observe the recovery status and new changes in the area. He looked at everyone. Our net has caught its first fish. Although it&#x27;s small, it has shown us the loopholes in the net.</p>
<p>We must continue to weave the net and continue to repair it. The world is becoming more sensitive and volatile, and we must become faster than it. This environmental awareness net will become one of our most important survival tools besides resources and military force. The environmental network serves two purposes. To discern the direction of the tides and to hear the faintest ominous hum from the deep sea before the waves truly shatter the deck.</p>
<p>The survival strategies of Mayuan Pavilion are quietly evolving through repeated observation, learning, and adjustments. Chapter 1, 13 footprints on the ice. The unexpected events at Emerald Atal provided the first practical test and valuable data calibration points for the environmental sensing network that Mayuan Pavilion is currently building. The spatiotemporal coupling between the mad dog waves and electromagnetic interference described by the caravan and the weak anomalies in several indicators previously captured by the environmental model. Although not providing an early warning pointed to a clear direction for optimizing the model algorithm, Leewi and Sue Chanchen&#x27;s research team embarked on a new round of intensive research.</p>
<p>Focusing on the emerald atal incident, they made sweeping improvements to the model&#x27;s multi-indicator collaborative analysis logic. The new algorithm added modules for regional anomaly energy density gradient calculation and cross medium water earth disturbance propagation delay correlation analysis and significantly lowered the alarm threshold for short-term multi-indicator co-occurrence anomalies. Although this inevitably leads to an increase in the false alarm rate, it is a necessary sacrifice under the current principle of better to report a false alarm than to miss one. Meanwhile, the engineering team under Shure House command accelerated the deployment of a high sensitivity monitoring network in the waters surrounding Emerald atal. In addition to the existing ion concentration, acoustic wave and magnetic field monitoring, highresolution surface wave radar and atmospheric electric field meters were added.</p>
<p>These new devices like more sophisticated tentacles are attempting to capture the precursor signals of the next possible similar local energy runaway. While Moyuang was busy perfecting its own monitoring system, the outside world&#x27;s perception and response to environmental changes became more diverse and specific. Dragon Souls academic guidance strategy continues. They have released a theoretical model paper on the possible modulation effect of global ocean circulation on the propagation of low-frequency energy disturbances as well as data on experimental observations of the abnormal responses of specific marine microbial populations to heavy metal ion concentrations. These achievements are of a high standard, but they still cleverly avoid any connection to human events, placing everything within the framework of natural science research.</p>
<p>However, careful observers will notice that the spatiotemporal distribution of the observational data cited in the papers highly overlaps with the abnormal reporting areas following the window and knocking events. This is a clever form of information disclosure intended only for insiders. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s fortification project is nearing completion. Chandwood was informants report that the core complex of that remote energy base is now covered with a distinct layer of dark composite material exhibiting a low reflectivity characteristic that can trash sharply with its surroundings in remote sensing images. The tidal and geothermal energy harvesting arrays around the base are also complete and quietly put into trial operation, but the vast amount of energy generated doesn&#x27;t seem to be being exported on a large scale.</p>
<p>Instead, it primarily supplies the base&#x27;s interior where several large unidentified enclosed factory structures have been added with no external markings or signs of activity. They are using stable natural energy sources to carry out some kind of internal project that requires high energy consumption and a highly isolated environment. Shin Duo Duo judged. Combined with their previous obsession with tidal energy in geothermal energy and their current eagerness to strengthen their defenses, this project is likely directly related to their pursuit of ancient knowledge or technology reproduction, and they are extremely wary of environmental disturbance and will spare no effort to ensure that is not disturbed. Panic and self-help behaviors at the grassroots level are polarized.</p>
<p>In some isolated islands where information is scarce and superstition prevails, absurd protective rituals are escalating, even leading to small-scale conflicts over so-called talismans for warding off evil. Meanwhile, in other areas with relatively convenient transportation and greater information exchange, disaster prevention guidelines based on simple practical experience are emerging. These include wrapping important electronic devices with multiple layers of tarp pollen and metal foil to protect against sudden electromagnetic pulses and adding layers of lime and charcoal to building foundations to prevent potential dampness and trace amounts of harmful gases. These rudimentary methods reflect the tenacious survival wisdom of ordinary people facing unknown threats. Amidst this chaotic and ongoing evolution, an unexpected yet perfectly logical letter was once again delivered to Lynn Mo through the secret channels of Conch Island.</p>
<p>The letter came from Vera&#x27;s team, which had been missing for a long time. The letter cut straight to the point without any pleasantries. Vera first briefly mentioned that after the window incident, her team had ventured deep into the Arctic Circle and some high latitude perafrost regions to conduct a series of investigations into the correlation between ancient ice cores and recent environmental disturbances. They drilled ice core samples to depths of over 100 meters in several remote ancient blue ice layers and conducted highresolution physicochemical analyses. We have found imprints in ice layers from several different locations and at different ages, the letter states that are highly similar to the energy signatures of the currently spreading environmental disturbances.</p>
<p>These imprints are manifested in the form of specific isotopic abundance anomalies, disordered sedimentary sequences of trace metal elements, and directional distortions in ice crystal structures. Preliminary judgments suggest that similar environmental disturbance events with specific energy signatures have not occurred for the first time in the long geological history and their cycles are difficult to estimate. But each one has left an indelible mark on the memory of the earth&#x27;s environment. Ice layers, sedimentary rocks. Vera points out that the current disturbances exhibit significant similarities in their energy signatures to certain ancient imprints recorded in ice cores, especially in the coupling patterns between highfrequency transient components and a low frequency background.</p>
<p>This strongly suggests that the source triggering the current disturbances may share a common or similar physical mechanism with those entities or events that left their mark in ancient times. At the end of the letter, Vera proposed a new collaboration. She was willing to share some anonymized ice core analysis data and energy characteristic comparison maps with Mo Yuan Go. The condition in exchange was that Mo Yuan Go could provide high temporal resolution sequences of multiparameter environmental monitoring data within a specific latitude and longitude grid in recent times especially before and after the Dragon operation to verify their ice core dating model and improve the construction of the current perturbation spatial propagation and attenuation model. We believe that combining historical imprints with present observations is the only way to understand this silent global transformation.</p>
<p>Vera wrote in the letter, knowledge should have no barriers, especially when it comes to the very foundations of survival. The value of this letter is immeasurable. For the first time, it provides precedent evidence for the current environmental disturbance on a macroscopic scale of geological history, elevating it from an isolated event to the level of a possible periodic natural/ unnatural phenomenon. The depth of research and global perspective demonstrated by Vera&#x27;s team once again made Mo Yuan Goof feel its own limitations and insignificance. No wonder they disappeared for so long in the Arctic Circle, Sue Chanchan exclaimed.</p>
<p>Icecore records are indeed the golden key to revealing long-term environmental changes. If their data is reliable, it means that what we are facing may not be a malfunctioning ancient machine, but a natural or unnatural law of periodic activity. Leeway focused more on the technical details. It&#x27;s reasonable for them to want our high temporal resolution data. Although our monitoring network has a smaller coverage than their historical samples, it may have an advantage over their drilling at fixed points in the polar regions in terms of temporal continuity and parameter diversity.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a perfect compliment. Lynn Mo Ponder for a long time. Vera&#x27;s proposal was frank and constructive, hitting the core of the problem. Exchanging data would benefit both sides and greatly advance their respective research. However, risks remained.</p>
<p>Providing detailed environmental monitoring data might expose some layout and capability details of the Moyuan Pavilion&#x27;s monitoring network. We can exchange them, Linmo finally decided, but the data needs to be processed a second time. We need to provide daily or semi-aily average sequences of three specific highly generalized environmental indicators such as regional energy disturbance comprehensive index, biological activity deviation, and geomagnetic stability score within a radius of 1,000 km centered on the ice shard area before and after operation Dragon Soul. We will not provide specific sensor locations, raw waveforms, or any details that could lead to the inference of our monitoring network density. At the same time, we require VAS team to provide corresponding rigorously dated ice core energy characteristic sequence samples as well as their quantitative analysis report on the similarity of the characteristics.</p>
<p>This was a carefully weighed exchange. Mo yuan goo provided macro trend data to meet Vera&#x27;s verification needs while protecting the core secrets of its own network. In return, obtaining the historical imprint data from the ice core played an irreplaceable role in refining its environmental model and understanding the nature of the disturbance. The letter was replied to according to this principle. Meanwhile, Lynn MMO instructed Shin Duo Duo to use all possible means to investigate more details of various teams activities in the Arctic Circle, especially the specific locations where they drilled ice cores and whether they had contact with other forces such as Dragon Souls Arctic Expedition Team.</p>
<p>He needed a more comprehensive assessment of the true intentions and potential risks of this mysterious scholar partner. Ancient imprints on the ice and a real-time monitoring network at sea are about to be connected via encrypted data streams. Moan pavilion has opened another new window on its path to understanding the world. The scenery outside is even grander and even more profound and unfathomable. And a map in their hands is gradually filling in the interwoven lines of history and the present, transforming it from a foggy blank.</p>
<p>Chapter 114. The data abyss. The data exchange between Muan Pavilion and Vera&#x27;s team was completed under high encryption and mutual vigilance. Both sides got what they wanted, but also harbored greater doubts about each other&#x27;s true intentions. Leewi and Sue Chanchen&#x27;s research team encountered a data explosion.</p>
<p>The eyes core analysis data provided by Vera&#x27;s team was like a time tunnel connecting current environmental disturbances with similar events in the distant past. Those intricate isotope ratio curves, trace element peaks and valleys, and ice crystal structure parameters after complex mathematical transformations revealed a chilling regularity. Look here. Leeway pointed to two overlapping curves on the screen. One for the energy disturbance index of current monitoring data and the other from an icecore sample from about 8,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Although the time scales are vastly different, the order of the peaks and troughs, the relative intensity ratios, and even some subtle oscillation patterns are more than 70% similar. This can&#x27;t possibly be a coincidence. Such an however focuses more on comparing data related to ecological impacts. The changes in biogenic silica deposition flux, an indicator of phytolankton productivity and the abundance of certain specific spores and pollen recorded in ice cores show a timephase lag correlation with the marine biological behavior disturbances and primary productivity fluctuations we currently observe. About 1 to 3 months after a disturbance, biogenic silica deposition flux first experiences a brief peak followed by a period of stagnation lasting several years.</p>
<p>This likely means that each such energy disturbance has a profound and lasting impact on global marine ecology and may even alter the climate. These findings elevate the severity of environmental disturbance to a new level. It is not merely a physical problem that could trigger geological disasters or equipment malfunctions, but a long-term threat that could reshape the entire planet&#x27;s ecology and climate. Just as Mayuan Pavilion was struggling to digest this historical data, their real-time monitoring network detected a new anomaly. Initially, a node in a high sensitivity monitoring network set up around Emerald atal recorded a sound signal lasting about 10 minutes with an extremely low frequency but a highly complex modulation.</p>
<p>This signal sounded like a dreaming almost indistinguishable amidst the background noise of the ocean. However, after being filtered and enhanced by a specific algorithm designed by Leeway, its internal structure revealed a disturbing grammatical sense. It didn&#x27;t resemble a natural phenomenon, but rather a conscious broadcast. In the following days, multiple monitoring points scattered across different sea areas and along different energy conduction paths successively captured signal fragments with similar characteristics. These signals varied in their occurrence time, duration, and specific frequency, but their core modulation grammar was highly consistent.</p>
<p>Even more disturbingly, the locations of these signals appeared to be moving slowly but clearly from the deep sea towards the shallower continental shelf along the main geological structural zones on the seabed. It asks like something or a group of things is speaking along the trench and mid ocean ridge and is approaching the land. that Sue Chanchian tried to perceive these signals with her sense of rhythm, but only felt a series of cold, chaotic, inorganic noises as if listening to the sleep talk of a huge malfunctioning machine. Chandwa&#x27;s intelligence network also reported related signs. Several coastal and island settlements reported that in recent nights, strange muffled sounds like many people underwater striking metal could be heard from the sea, sometimes accompanied by a faint glow in the seaater.</p>
<p>Some fishermen claimed that while trwers in deep water, they had pulled up strange shaped objects that looked like machine parts or bones. But these objects were quickly bought up by unidentified people at high prices. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood suddenly resumed its activities. No longer confined to fortifying their base, they dispatched several small fast reconnaissance fleets to the waters where unusual signals were frequently reported, seemingly searching urgently for something. Simultaneously, their demand for deep sea salvage technology and high compression resistant materials on the black market increased dramatically.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul also seems to have taken note of these new developments. They have strengthened their monitoring of the country&#x27;s coastline and important shipping lanes and unusually issued a safety warning to all maritime operators, reminding them to be aware of unidentified underwater sounds and luminous phenomena and advising them to avoid operating in deep sea areas at night without providing further explanation. Inside the command center of Mayuan Pavilion, all the clues and intelligence converged, pointing to a disturbing possibility. Something deep beneath the sea is being awakened or attracted by continuous environmental disturbances and is beginning to approach areas of human activity. We need to know what that is.</p>
<p>Linmo made the decision. Leeway concentrate all computing resources and try to crack the modulation patterns of those signals to see if we can extract any meaningful information. Such Chian compared the ice core data provided by Vera to see if there are any records or indirect evidence of deep sea anomalies in similar periods of disturbance in history. He looked at sure how and Chien Duo Duo strengthen the defense of all our coastal facilities and shipping routes, especially the underwater sections. Send a crack reconnaissance team aboard the Storm Shadow, a specially modified speedboat with excellent stealth and quietness capabilities to the nearest point of anomalous signal outbreak for on-site reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Remember, observe only, do not make contact, and do not expose yourselves. Clear. A new crisis, like an iceberg emerging from the abyss of data, is revealing its menacing corner. The Moan Pavilion is on high alert once more. This time, the threat is no longer confined to distant icy plains or mysterious ruins, but is slowly approaching their homeland from beneath the deep sea.</p>
<p>And their understanding of this threat is virtually zero. The shadow of the storm silently sets sail under the cover of night, heading towards the seas where ominous whispers had recently begun to echo. The ship was equipped with state-of-the-art passive sonar and optical observation equipment, as well as a seasoned reconnaissance squad. They would become the first eyes of the ink abyss pavilion reaching into the dark abyss. Meanwhile, Leewi and Su Chian continued searching through mountains of data for any clues that might reveal the truth.</p>
<p>They both knew that time was running out. Chapter 115. A glimpse into the abyss. Like a true deep sea phantom, the shadow of the storm glides silently across the rippling surface of the moonless night. Its hull is treated with a special coating that absorbs most radar waves and visible light.</p>
<p>And its propeller has been modified for quieter operation, minimizing noise in all electric propulsion mode. Inside the four reconnaissance team members, Captain Shan Hai, Deputy sonar operator Xiao Foam, observer Wuru, and technician Sun Lee each performed their duties with focus concentration. Their target was a recent anomalous signal outburst located approximately 120 nautical miles southeast of the main island in a deep sea basin near the edge of the continental shelf. According to monitoring network data, the distinctive modulation murmur had been detected there three times in the past 48 hours with a signal strength showing an increasing trend. Five nautical miles from the target area, Chunghai whispered into the internal communication channel.</p>
<p>He was an experienced veteran with dark skin and sharp eagle-like eyes. Everyone check your equipment and enter level one silence. Do not speak unless absolutely necessary. Communicate with hand gestures. The last faint indicator lights inside the submarine went out, leaving only the heavily filtered dim green light from the screens in front of each person.</p>
<p>The waveforms on the sonar screens jumped around, displaying the complex terrain and biological echoes below. Xiao Fong, wearing headphones, was completely focused on distinguishing every subtle sound. The shadow of the storm slowly approached the designated coordinates. The sea was unusually calm with only the slightest ripples left by a gentle breeze, but this calm only made the atmosphere inside the vessel more tense. Approach the edge of the target and stop the ship.</p>
<p>Deploy the toad array sonar. Chunghai ordered. A long cableconnected sonar array was slowly lowered into the water, providing more sensitive and longer range passive listening capabilities than shipboard sonar. Time passed in silence. 10 minutes, 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The sonar screen showed nothing but the normal background ocean noise and the occasional school of fish. Could the signal source have moved or is it just intermittent? Suddenly wondered in a low voice. She was responsible for monitoring the environmental sensor data. Sh. Xiao Fong suddenly raised his hand, making a shushing gesture.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, his brows furrowed as if listening to a very distant sound. In the headphones, besides the rustling of the flowing seawater, there seemed to be another extremely faint rhythmic tapping sound with long intervals, but each tap had a dull texture. Suspected target signal detected. Xiao Fong opened his eyes, speaking rapidly but clearly, bearing 275, distance approximately three nautical miles, depth very deep, over 800 m. Signal characteristics match the monitoring network records with 85% accuracy.</p>
<p>Everyone&#x27;s spirits lifted. Chennhai immediately ordered, &quot;Maintain absolute silence and record all data. Woo Rua. Activate the low light night vision periscope and observe the sea surface for any accompanying anomalies. Storm shadow floated silently like a real reef.</p>
<p>The toad sonar array continuously received the dull regular tapping from the deep sea. As time passed, the frequency of the tapping seemed to increase extremely slowly, and more complex, brief echoes began to appear, as if there was more than one object being tapped, or that the tapping had triggered some kind of structural resonance. Suddenly, Wua lowered his voice with a slight, almost imperceptible tremor. Captain, at 2:00 in the sea, about 500 meters above sea level, there&#x27;s a faint light, not phosphoresence, but a cold bluish green light rising up in patches from underwater. Chennhai immediately moved closer to the periscope.</p>
<p>He saw that the sea was boiling. From the unfathomable darkness, clusters of blue, green, fist-sized halos of light were constantly rising. The halos weren&#x27;t intense, flickering faintly, illuminating a small patch of water around them. At the center of each halo, something small and irregular could be vaguely seen. The halos rose to about 10 meters above the surface and then stopped, no longer rising, simply hovering there, slowly drifting with the current.</p>
<p>Record the images, analyze the spectrum, Chanhai shouted in a low voice. Suddenly operated the equipment rapidly. Spectroscopic analysis reveals non-bioluminescent characteristics. Wavelengths are concentrated in the 480 to 520 nanometer range. Energy source unknown.</p>
<p>Non-thermal radiation. Preliminary morphological identification of the central material suggests irregular metal or mineral fragments. Wake. The surface of these fragments seems to have extremely fine scratches. Just then, Xiao Fangg&#x27;s voice rang out again, this time with even greater seriousness.</p>
<p>Sonar signal change. The knocking has stopped. A new sound has appeared like friction. A large number of fine friction sounds are coming from the same area and are rising. On the sonar screen, the echoes representing that deep sea area suddenly became dense and chaotic as if something was emerging from the loose sediment on the seabed, stirring up large amounts of mud and debris.</p>
<p>Prepare to evacuate. Chennhai ordered decisively slowly retract the toad array. Prepare power. Head 180. Maintain minimum speed and do not create a noticeable wake.</p>
<p>The shadow of the storm began to slowly move backward as if fading into the shadows. Everyone&#x27;s hearts were in their throats, their eyes fixed on the sonar screen and the periscope image. The blue green halos began to move, no longer drifting aimlessly, but as if drawn by some force, slowly but surely converging towards the direction where the shadow of the storm had just lingered. At the same time, the fine friction sounds beneath the sea grew louder, accompanied by more churned sediment echoes. Are they tracking where we were just now.</p>
<p>Wurui&#x27;s voice was dry. Ignore them. Keep evacuating. Be mindful of the depth. They might only be active at certain depths.</p>
<p>Chennhai remained calm. The shadow of the storm gradually moved away from the strange and active sea area. It wasn&#x27;t until it had receded more than a nautical mile that the abnormal echoes on the sonar, gradually weakened and dissipated. The blue green halos also stopped converging and returned to a state of aimless floating, eventually fading and sinking into the deep sea. After confirming safety, storm shadow slightly increased its speed and quietly returned towards the direction of Mo Yuan Pavilion.</p>
<p>Inside the vessel, no one spoke. Only the soft hum of the equipment and the heavy breathing of everyone present filled the air. What they had just witnessed exceeded all their previous knowledge and imagination. Hours later, the shadow of storms returned safely, bringing back valuable recorded data and highdefinition images. The atmosphere in the underground command center of Myuan Pavilion was even more tense than before.</p>
<p>The images and data brought back by the reconnaissance team were repeatedly played and analyzed. Leewi spoke first, pointing to the enhanced image on the screen of the fragments of the center of the halo. Look at these engravings. Although extremely small and incomplete, their straight lines and specific corner patterns are similar to any ancient symbolic system we know, but not exactly the same. It&#x27;s more like a mark left by an older, more basic, or perhaps industrialized mass production.</p>
<p>Such an however focused on the blue green cold light. Energy characteristic analysis shows that this light emmitting method is extremely inefficient and is accompanied by trace amounts of specific radioactive isotope decay characteristics. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be designed for lighting or communication. Rather, it seems to be a byproduct of some kind of energy conversion or matter decay process. Sure, how analyzed from a military perspective.</p>
<p>These things, whatever they are, have shown a certain degree of reactivity. They respond to soundwave stimulation, knocking sounds, and may also be aware of hydrodnamic disturbances. They converge after we move. Moreover, they seem to mainly operate in the deep sea and mid ocean waters. And so far, there has been no indication that they intend to rise to shallow waters or attack ships.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that there is no threat. Chin Duo Duo summarized the latest news from the intelligence network. Similar phenomena have been sporadically reported in the past 24 hours in two other deep sea areas on the edge of the continental shelf to the east and south. The scale is smaller than the one we encountered, but the characteristics are similar. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s reconnaissance ships have also appeared near those areas.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul has not yet made a public response, but we have detected that several of their research ships are undergoing emergency modifications with large-scale deep sea fishing and isolation equipment installed. Lenimo listened silently to all the reports, his gaze shifting between the eerie halo, the strange markings, and the constantly updating intelligence summaries on the screen. Beneath the deep sea, something has indeed been awakened. These things appear to be related to ancient civilizations, marks, accompanied by unusual energy phenomena, cold light, and respond to sound waves of specific frequencies. They are slowly moving and spreading from the deep sea towards the edge of the continental shelf.</p>
<p>This is no longer a mystery of remote ice fields, nor a potential threat to the southwest bay. This is an ongoing, spreading, and unexplained deep sea anomaly. Compare these new findings. is the scratch features the cold light energy spectrum and their acoustic response characteristics with the ice core data provided by Vera Lin Mo instructed leeway and such focus on finding any indirect records of deep sea bioluminescence metal debris deposition or abnormal biological activity during similar periods of disturbance in history. We need to know whether these things have appeared in the past and what impact they had at the time.</p>
<p>Dot. He turned to Sure. How in Shin Duo Duo, we must fully upgrade our maritime early warning system. All vessels, especially those operating in the deep sea or navigating the edge of the continental shelf, must be equipped with improved passive sonar and optical anomaly detection equipment. We must develop emergency avoidance and response procedures for encountering similar phenomena.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must anonymously share the basic characteristics, excluding specific locations and scratch details of these deep sea anomalies that we observe with several reputable regional survivor mutual aid networks through covert channels which will serve as an early warning dot. In addition, Lynn Moaused all non-essential deep sea activities will be suspended. Our environmental awareness network will focus on increasing the monitoring density of water composition, background noise, and biological aggregation behavior in the continental shelf margin area. The abyss has been glimpsed, revealing a cold, eerie, and unknown corner. The Mo Yuan Pavilion must adjust its strategy, shifting from simple land island defense to confronting entirely new challenges that may arise from the deep sea beneath its feet.</p>
<p>This world is becoming increasingly unfamiliar and dangerous at a speed beyond everyone&#x27;s comprehension. And the test of survival has entered a new and deeper dimension. Chapter 1, 16 fragments of Revelation. The deep sea images and data brought back by shadow of a storm are like another boulder thrown into the pool of knowledge at Mayuan Pavilion. The strangely marked metal fragments, the eerie cold light, and the unknown entities that exhibit reactivity to sound waves and disturbances have completely changed everyone&#x27;s imagination of the threat of environmental disturbances.</p>
<p>The threat is no longer limited to invisible energy fields and macroscopic climate change. It has taken on a concrete, observable, and possibly even active form. Leeway and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s workload suddenly increased dramatically. They not only had to continue refining the overall environmental model, but now they also had to focus all their efforts on analyzing these newly emerging deep sea anomalies. The ice core data provided by Vera&#x27;s team became a crucial control system.</p>
<p>The two led their team day and night in data mining and comparison. We&#x27;ve made a discovery. 3 days later, Leeway is eyes bloodshot reported to Lin Mo, his voice with excitement. We compared records of trace metal element depositional anomalies and specific isotope abundance peaks from over 40 ice core samples from different eras and locations. We found that although the occurrence cycles of these anomalies are long and irregular, their spatial distribution shows a striking statistical correlation with the trends of major seafloor spreading zones, subduction zones, and large seamount chains worldwide.</p>
<p>He pulled up a transparent layer covering a global nautical chart on which known major seafloor geological structures were marked with red lines and the approximate corresponding sea areas of anomalous events in the ice core records were marked with blue dots inferred from isotope atmospheric transport models. The red lines and the groups of blue dots showed a high degree of overlap. This means leeway pointed to the nautical chart that the source events that have caused global environmental disturbances in history are likely to have occurred in these areas of intense seabed geological activity or conversely the geological structure of these areas may be more likely to record or amplify a certain type of energy disturbance. Such an added key finding more notably in those sedimentary anomalous layers. We re-examined the microscopic images of ice core samples attached to the veridata using a high-powered electron microscope and discovered extremely tiny geometric structures with morphologies highly similar to the debris grooves captured by shadow of the storm.</p>
<p>Although blurred due to ice crystal encapsulation and age, the basic characteristics are consistent. This indicates that similar debris or rather material with this specific groove also appeared on a large scale during historical periods of disturbance and was captured by the ice layer with upwelling or atmospheric deposition. This discovery directly links deep sea anomalies to historical global disturbances. The debris is not an isolated newly emerging anomaly, but rather likely a byproduct or leakage accompanying each major disturbance. What are they? Linmo asked the core question.</p>
<p>Leewi took a deep breath. Based on the existing information, we propose a preliminary highly speculative hypothesis. These fragments may not be natural minerals, nor are they complete ancient artifacts. They are more like metabolic waste or structural fragments produced during the operation, maintenance, or disintegration of some large complex system. Those markings may be a kind of product batch identification, functional code, or discard mark.</p>
<p>and the faint cold light and radioactivity they carry may be a manifestation of the slow decay of some unstable energy structure inside them. As for their reactivity, Sue Shian continued, &quot;It may stem from the extremely weak energy field or information structure remaining within them, which can resonate or trigger extremely inefficiently with external sound waves or energy disturbances of a specific frequency. Just like a piece of iron filings with weak magnetism will be attracted when it gets close to a magnet. They gather at the location where the shadow of the storm has been. Possibly not because they&#x27;re tracking us, but because they are attracted by the extremely weak noise or disturbances of specific frequency leaked from a hole or sonar array during operation.</p>
<p>If this hypothesis holds true, it means that beneath the deep sea, there may be one or more unimaginably large ancient industrial systems or energy processing systems. They&#x27;re still partially operational or periodically activated. These debris fragments are simply debris inadvertently discharged or shed from the system. The current environmental disturbances are as if this system has once again entered a period of activity or a period of failure, causing more debris and energy byproducts to be released. The impact of this hypothesis is far greater and more unsettling than any previous speculation about a single ancient site.</p>
<p>It points not to a few scattered ancient ruins, but to an unimaginable network of ancient infrastructure spanning the global seabed, deeply intertwined with Earth&#x27;s geological activity. Just as internal research was making groundbreaking progress, the external situation was also escalating. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood reacted most swiftly and aggressively to the deep sea anomalies. Their reconnaissance fleet began frequently patrolling the major mid ocean ridges and trenches of the oceans, employing large deep sea trolls and robotic arms in an attempt to salvage the luminous debris and potentially larger wreckage. Intelligence indicated they had successfully captured some samples and urgently transported them back to their fortified energy base.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, their demand for high-grade radiation shielding materials and unknown substance analysis technology skyrocketed on the black market with prices reaching astonishing levels. Dragon Soul, on the other hand, appeared more cautious and systematic. After completing the refit of their research fleet, they did not engage in large-scale salvage operations like the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Instead, they began deploying a long-term multi-node seabed observation network in several selected continental shelf edges. This network integrates various sensors, including acoustic, optical, chemical, and geomagnetic sensors, seemingly aiming to monitor the long-term occurrence patterns, migration paths, and correlations with changes in environmental parameters of these deep sea anomalies.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Dragon Soul released a scientific explanation regarding the recent observations of spontaneous luminescence and enhanced underwater geological activity in some sea areas through official channels. Again, attributing the phenomenon to complex seabed physicochemical processes and urging all parties to conduct research with a scientific attitude and avoid panic and irrational behavior. The panic at the grassroots level, fueled by both the scientific guidance from the dragon soul and an increasing number of eyewitness reports presents a contradictory mix. On the one hand, official explanations offer some reassurance. On the other hand, those who personally experience the events or listen to detailed eyewitness accounts feel a deeper unease.</p>
<p>In some islands and coastal settlements near the areas reporting deep sea anomalies, spontaneously organized nighttime patrols and the erection of makeshift underwater obstacles have become commonplace. Vera&#x27;s team fell silent again after the data exchange. However, she and Duo Duo, utilizing top level infiltration resources, finally uncovered a clue. Core members of Vera&#x27;s team, it seemed, had secretly visited Dragon Souls Advanced Research Facility in Northern Port after the shadow of a storm reconnaissance incident. Their stay was brief and the meeting was highly classified.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Dragon Souls Deep Sea Observation Network deployment plan accelerated significantly and some technical details appear to incorporate designs unconventional for Dragon Souls traditional style. They&#x27;re sharing technology or at least coordinating at the high level. Chien du duo judged. They share the same goal to figure out what s really down there in the deep sea. Just as all eyes were on the deep sea, the Muan Pavilion&#x27;s monitoring network detected a subtle but important change.</p>
<p>The persistent weak and stable background noise in the southwest Misty Bay direction experienced three brief but significant attenuations in the past 48 hours, each lasting about half an hour before returning to normal. Simultaneously, sensors deployed further away, targeting macroscopic disturbances in the energy field recorded three extremely weak energy release pulses originating from the southwest direction corresponding to the same time frames. That construct seems to be performing a very long cycle, very low power pulse type selfch check or energy discharge. Leeway analyzed the data each time it discharges its own stable field background noise will temporarily weaken. Could this be a way for it to maintain a low power sleep state? Or is it trying to achieve some kind of very low-level synchronization or tuning with the changing energy background of the outside world? This discovery suggests that the creatures in the southwestern bay, though seemingly dormant, are not dead and are still interacting with this changing world in an extremely slow manner in ways imperceptible to humans.</p>
<p>All the clues historical imprints and ice cores, active debris in the deep sea, faint pulsations in the bay, and intensified investigations from all sides point to the same profound and dark truth. Beneath the waters of this world lie ancient relics far beyond human imagination which are being disturbed by continuous environmental disturbances and are gradually emerging from their millions of years of slumber revealing their vague and eerie outlines. Mo Yuan Pavilion was like an observer standing on the edge of a dark forest having just shown a flashlight on the first strange glowing leaf while the entire forest remained hidden in boundless darkness and mist. Linimo knew they had to be even more cautious, but they also had to continue deeper because this forest might very well be the very land beneath their feet upon which they depended for survival. Ignorance of it was the greatest danger.</p>
<p>The revelation brought by the fragments had only lifted a tiny corner of the veil of truth. Chapter 117, the data chain. Leewi and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s bold conjecture that deep sea debris is a metabolic product of ancient systems was like a depth charge dropped into the cognitive landscape of Mo Yuan Go. This conjecture connected scattered clues environmental disturbances, ice core imprints, active debris, and even the faint pulsations in the southwest B to a faintly discernable logical chain. Although many links in this chain remain weak and full of assumptions, it provides an unprecedented holistic framework for thinking, the focus of the work naturally shifted to verifying and enriching this framework.</p>
<p>Leeway divided the research team into two directions. One group continued to delve deeper into the ice core data provided by Vera, attempting to reverse engineer more quantitative information about the composition, release amount, and release cycle of metabolic products in relation to geological activities from those ancient environmental imprints. The other group focused on tackling the debris sample data, mainly highresolution images and spectral analysis brought back by storm shadow, trying to decipher the possible information encoding rules from those strange markings. The analysis of the scuts has been exceptionally difficult. The scuts are extremely small and most have been blurred and incomplete due to seawater erosion and the passage of time.</p>
<p>Leeway tried all known methods of symbol comparison and even applied some of the geometric grammar summarized from his research on hemlock island slabs but still could not form a meaningful interpretation. The combination of the scuts seems random yet it subtly reveals a cold sense of order. Maybe weary going in the wrong direction. dot. Sue Chian, who had been staying up all night, rubbed her temples and suggested a new idea.</p>
<p>These marks might not be words or symbols, not used to express abstract concepts. Could they be a kind of physical identifier like the assembly line number, material code, or tolerance mark on modern industrial parts? Their significance lies not in being read, but in being identified by specific inspection equipment or processing systems through touch, magnetic field, or some kind of energy resonance. This idea suddenly dawned on leeway. That&#x27;s right. If these fragments are indeed discarded parts or processing waste from some large system, then the markings on them are more likely machine readable codes used for sorting, recycling, or quality traceability.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re trying to understand them like we&#x27;re interpreting text just like trying to see a barcode with our eyes, we can only see a bunch of black and white stripes. Only by using a laser scanner to read it can we get the numerical information underneath. This shift in understanding is crucial. It means that to truly understand these fragments moan may need a completely different reading technology perhaps involving specific energy frequencies, scanning angles or field effects precisely what they currently lack. But this at least explains why the Stonemason brothers were so eager to salvage these fragments.</p>
<p>Chin Duodo pointed out at the analysis meeting they may have possessed or thought they possessed some of the reading technology. They wanted to deduce from these discarded parts the technical standards, material formulas, and even the operating logic of that ancient production line. This seems to be less risky than exploring a complete, possibly self-defensible relic, but the potential gains are equally enormous. Just as the research at Mayuan Pavilion was fluctuating between confusion and breakthroughs, the flow of information about deep sea anomalies in the outside world began to show more obvious stratification and competition. Preliminary data from Dragon Souls deep sea observation network appears to be selectively leaking to certain friendly research institutions and large survivor alliances.</p>
<p>This data has been carefully cleaned, removing all sensitive information that might point to humaninduced or non-natural intelligence and primarily presents highly specialized marine geological and physicochemical reports such as enhanced submarine turbidity current activity, abnormal composition of local hydrothermal vent materials, and statistical analysis of the optical properties of deep sea suspended particulate matter. Dragon Soul is attempting to consolidate its dominant discourse on environmental anomalies through this limited sharing of authoritative scientific data, guiding all parties along the path of natural scientific research, it has set. However, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s actions were constantly tearing away this scientific veil. They weren&#x27;t just salvaging debris. According to the latest intelligence, one of their elite deep sea operations teams had apparently successfully captured an irregularly shaped metal plate roughly the size of a tabletop on a seammount slope.</p>
<p>When the debris was brought to the surface, an eyewitness, a hired oceangoing cargo ship captain who happened to see it from a great distance through binoculars, described it as flashing with unstable dark blue arcs of electricity, the surrounding seawater boiling violently and emitting a strong ozone odor. The debris was quickly transferred into a speciallyesed, sealed container filled with pipes and cooling devices and transported away at high speed by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s speciallymade speedboat. Although the news did not spread widely, it caused a stir within the small circles of top powers. A piece of wreckage capable of spontaneously releasing energy and of considerable size is far more valuable than tiny fragments. It may contain a more complete structure, clearer markings, and may even retain some internal components or energy circuits.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood has really caught a big fish this time. Chien Duod Duo said solemnly, &quot;This remnant may give them a temporary lead in the race to decipher ancient technology, but fortune and misfortune are intertwined, and possessing a treasure can be a crime. Other forces will not sit idly by, especially dragon soul.&quot; Sure enough, less than 48 hours after the wreckage was salvaged, a rapid reaction fleet deployed by Dragon Soul in the relevant sea area began a high-profile combat readiness patrol exercise. The exercise area intentionally or unintentionally covered several routes that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood might take from the salvage point to their base. This was an undisguised show of force and pressure.</p>
<p>The information ecosystem at the grassroots level is even more chaotic. In addition to the increasing number of eyewitness reports and panic responses, some scattered folk experience summaries about interpreting deep sea lights or using unusual signs to predict the weather have begun to emerge. These summaries vary in quality. Some are based on superficial observations and coincidences while others are clearly mixed with superstition and conjecture. However, they reflect the tenacious efforts of ordinary survivors who unable to access highle information and technology are trying to understand and adapt to change in their own way.</p>
<p>Just as information from various sources was intertwined and undercurrents were intensifying, the internal network of Mayuan Pavilion detected an extremely faint but seemingly clearly directional abnormal signal. The signal did not originate from the deep sea, nor from environmental disturbance data, but rather from a low-frequency backup communication channel that they had previously used during data exchanges with Vera&#x27;s team and which had since been abandoned. The signal was extremely brief, a complexely encrypted digital pulse train, but using the same encryption method as the one previously used by Vera&#x27;s team. The pulse train was automatically captured and tagged by Mo Yuan G&#x27;s communication monitoring system. Is it Vera&#x27;s team? Why are they using an abandoned channel? And the signal is so weak.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re unsure if we&#x27;re still listening or the transmission conditions are extremely poor. Chi and Duo Duo reported to Lynn Mo immediately. Can it be cracked? Lynn Mo asked. I&#x27;m familiar with the encryption method and I&#x27;m trying out. It will take time.</p>
<p>The signal content should be very short. Chin Duo Duo replied. Hours later, the initial deciphering results came back. The message was still only one sentence with obvious garbled text due to data loss. Wreckage critical interface fragment reading requires resonance.</p>
<p>Be wary of actively searching for coordinates. Data loss. The information was fragmented yet its meaning was astonishing. Vera&#x27;s team clearly knew about the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood salvage of the large piece of wreckage, the key to the wreckage. Referring to it as the interface fragment and noting that reading it requires resonance.</p>
<p>This confirmed Leewayi and Sue Chian&#x27;s conjecture that the engraving required a specific method to read it. More importantly, they issued a warning to be wary of active searching. What does this active searching refer to? Is it the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s actions or something else? And where does the last lost coordinate point? They re-risking their lives to send us a message. Sue Chanchian analyzed using abandoned channels and brief vague information suggests that their situation might be unsafe or that their communications are being monitored. Could vigilant and proactive search mean that their attempt to read that piece of debris might like the dragon soles knocking on the door experiment accidentally trigger something or attract some kind of searcher? This speculation is chilling.</p>
<p>If reading an unclaimed interface fragment can be risky, then what kind of entity is the complete system hidden beneath the deep sea that can produce these fragments? Vera&#x27;s shattered warning, like another fine thread, was woven into the web of knowledge about this world that Mo Yuan Pavilion was striving to build. This web was still full of loopholes and shrouded in mist. But with each new clue added, the vast and ancient outline hidden beneath the surface became more real and more onspiring. The chain of data is gradually linking the past and present. The deep sea and the icy plains, the power struggles between various factions and the shattered warnings of the enigmatic scholar.</p>
<p>Mo Yuan Pavilion knows they stand at the starting point of an increasingly clear yet increasingly dangerous path of cognition. Whether what lies ahead is deeper darkness or the glimmer of dawn, no one knows. All they can do is firmly grasp these fragile chains of data and conjecture and continue cautiously peering into that unknown abyss. Chapter 118. The danger of resonance.</p>
<p>The broken warning from Vera&#x27;s team via the abandoned channel was like several sharp icicles stuck in the minds of the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s decision makers. Interface fragments. Reading requires resonance. Beware of active searching. Each word carried a weight and chill far beyond its literal meaning.</p>
<p>This warning came abruptly and secretly, indicating that Vera&#x27;s team was either in danger or had foreseen some imminent peril, and that this danger might be directly related to the large wreckage that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood had just acquired. Lynmo did not immediately take radical action. He ordered Chien Duo Duo to use all backup and unconventional monitoring methods to closely monitor all electromagnetic and acoustic signals around the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base, especially any possible abnormal energy fluctuations. At the same time, he instructed Leewi and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s research team to simulate and deduce with the highest priority the various physical reactions and energy coupling scenarios that might be triggered by resonant reading of a large metal remnant carrying an unknown energy structure. The key is resonance.</p>
<p>Leeway spread out his draft at the emergency meeting. Vera specifically emphasized this word. This means that reading is not a simple physical scan or chemical analysis, but rather stimulating some kind of inherent frequency or energy structure that may remain inside the debris, making it respond, thereby exposing its internal information or structural features. This is essentially the same kind of technology as Dragon Soul, using the key crystal to establish a low power link with the ice shard system. only the object has changed from a huge potentially defensive complete system to a relatively static seemingly harmless fragment.</p>
<p>Suchian frowned, but Vera warned of being wary of active searching. If it&#x27;s just reading a fragment, why would there be such a warning? Unless this resonance reading is not just asking about the fragment itself, its energy signal might be heard by some unknown entity that is either of the same origin as or hostile to the fragment or worse. Although the fragment itself is incomplete, there may still be an extremely unstable critical self-destruction or calling mechanism inside and the external resonance attempt might become the trigger to detonate or activate it. This conjecture seemed to lower the temperature in the conference room by several degrees. Sure, how said in a deep voice.</p>
<p>In other words, what the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is holding in their hands may not be a gold brick, but a bomb whose fuse is unknown. Their attempt to read it is like defusing a bomb and doing so with almost no understanding of its structure. We must assume the worst case scenario. Lynmo finally set the tone. Leeway, your simulation should focus on three risk scenarios.</p>
<p>The overflow of resonance energy, the triggering of unstable structures within the fragments, and the activation of possible signal broadcasts, and estimate their impact range. Chen Duo Duo Focus Intelligence monitoring on whether there are any abnormal personnel evacuations, energy fluctuations or signs of a surge in encrypted communications at the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base. Sure. How have all our peripheral monitoring points, especially those facing the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base? Put them on high alert, ready to record any possible spillover energy or signal characteristics stuck. For the next 2 days, Emo Yuan Pavilion maintained a high level of alert, outwardly relaxed, but inwardly tense.</p>
<p>On the surface, the island operated as usual with training, production, and research continuing. But within the core circle, everyone was on edge. The area surrounding the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base remained eerily calm. However, analysis of thermal and lowlight images transmitted from high altitude reconnaissance balloons revealed a significant increase in heat activity in several large enclosed buildings within the base in recent days, exhibiting irregular pulse characteristics clearly inconsistent with the base&#x27;s stable tidal and geothermal energy input rhythm. Simultaneously, Chindwa&#x27;s wideband antenna deployed at a considerable distance detected extremely weak but persistent electromagnetic background noise emanating from the base&#x27;s direction with subtly fluctuating frequencies.</p>
<p>This strongly resembled leakage from a large number of sophisticated electronic devices operating at full capacity during complex frequency adjustments that were difficult to completely shield. They have definitely started trying to read it, Chin Duo asserted. And they&#x27;re progressing quickly with the power and complexity of the equipment continuously increasing. Just as my UN pavilion was closely monitoring the movements of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, their global environmental monitoring network detected new and more widespread abnormal disturbances. This is not a violent eruption at a single point, but rather a slow but widespread background uplift.</p>
<p>Much like the eb and flow of tides, multiple monitoring points scattered across different oceans and depths have recorded a synchronous gradual increase in abnormal ion concentration indices and infrasound intensity at specific frequencies over the past 48 hours. The increase is not significant, but the trend is clear and the coverage has begun to spread from the edges of active geological zones to a wider basin area. It&#x27;s like a large net being gently rippled and the ripples are spreading throughout the entire system. Such Chanchan looked at the monitoring data summary chart with deep concern. This global gradual synchronous rise is more unsettling than the previous localized violent outbreaks.</p>
<p>It indicates that the impact of the disturbance source is deepening or in other words the sensitivity or responsiveness of the entire marine environmental system to such disturbances is generally increasing. Leeway attempted to compare this new phenomenon with long cycle records in the Vera icecore data. Some very old ice records show that during the incubation period before major disturbance events, there are sometimes similar baseline drifts of environmental parameters that last for tens to hundreds of years. This may be a warm-up sign before the entire system, whether natural or unnatural, enters an active long cycle. This discovery places the current series of events from the window to the knocking on the door and then to the emergence of deep sea debris and the spread of environmental disturbances within a larger and more pressing time scale.</p>
<p>They may not be dealing with just a few isolated incidents, but rather standing at the starting point of a long active cycle. Against this backdrop of global undercurrents, the storm in the direction of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base finally saw its first flash of lightning. Laid on the third night, a secret acoustic monitoring buoy set up by Moyuan Pavilion in the southwest direction about 200 nautical miles from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base captured an extremely brief but extremely strong broadband energy pulse. The pulse lasted for less than 100th of a second, but its instantaneous energy peak exceeded the maximum value ever recorded by the buoy, directly triggering the equipment&#x27;s overload protection. Almost simultaneously, several magnetic field and atmospheric electric field monitoring points facing that direction also recorded corresponding strong instantaneous disturbances.</p>
<p>Further away, the main island monitoring array of Mayuan Pavilion even captured an extremely weak echo from the deep sea, but with frequency characteristics highly correlated with that pulse, as if part of the pulse&#x27;s energy had penetrated the seawater and straighta and been reflected back by something hidden somewhere deep inside. Something&#x27;s happened. She duo duo rushed into the command center, his face pale. The source of the pulse has been pinpointed to the core area of the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood base. The energy signature contains a large number of frequency components related to highfrequency transient buffers, but it&#x27;s completely out of control, releasing explosively.</p>
<p>Leeway quickly retrieved the detailed spectrum of the pulse for analysis, his fingers trembling slightly. This this is very similar to the scenario in our simulations where resonance energy generates positive feedback with the unstable structure inside the fragment leading to a local energy avalanche release. They may have triggered the fragments self-destruction or overload protection mechanism. Moreover, the pulse contains strong unm modulated carrier signals, which is like some kind of raw data or status code stored inside the fragment being violently erupted. Almost exactly a few minutes after Emmo Yuinga detected the pulse, several encrypted communication signals requesting emergency assistance and reporting distress broke through the silence at extremely high power, shooting in several different directions from the direction of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base.</p>
<p>The content of the signals was chaotic, but the core message was clear. A serious experimental accident had occurred inside the base, causing energy runaway and structural damage. requesting emergency technical support and medical assistance. Vera&#x27;s warning proved prophetic. The active search brought disaster.</p>
<p>Monitor all spilled energy and signals. Record every detail. Lynmo&#x27;s voice was calm, but his eyes were sharp as knives. Activate level one silence. Suspend all external communications.</p>
<p>Sure. How? Strengthen the island&#x27;s defenses, especially against potential energy shock waves or electromagnetic pulses. She and Duo Duo closely monitor the responses of all parties to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s distress signal, especially Dragon Soul. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s resonance experiment ended in a violent and potentially costly accident. What unpredictable changes will this accident and the runaway energy and potential data fragments it broadcast to the world bring to an already turbulent situation? The Mo Yuan Pavilion is like a ship standing before a tsunami just beginning.</p>
<p>The first wave&#x27;s roar has already reached them. While an even larger wall of water is slowly rising in the distant darkness, the danger of resonance is already evident. The real storm may have only just begun to brew. Chapter 119, Aftermath Assessment. The brief but intense energy pulse that erupted from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base was like a blinding flash of lightning in the night.</p>
<p>Though fleeting, it instantly illuminated many things hidden in the shadows and cast a long shadow in everyone&#x27;s hearts. Following the incident, Mayuin Pavilion maintained a 12-hour state of maximum silence and alert. All observation equipment operated at full power, recording the recovery process of various environmental parameters such as energy, magnetic field, and acoustics after the pulse, as well as whether there would be any subsequent secondary outbreaks or abnormal spread. The direct physical impact of the pulse itself did not cause significant damage to the main island of Mayuan Pavilion, which is more than 200 nautical miles away. It only caused brief fluctuations in the readings of some sensitive electronic devices.</p>
<p>However, the complex energy characteristics contained in the pulse and the unknown information fragments that may be erupted with it are what truly require vigilance. Leewi and Sue Chanchians team worked through the night to analyze the captured pulse data. Spectral analysis confirmed Leewayi&#x27;s initial assessment. The pulse energy was concentrated in several narrow frequency bands related to the highfrequency transient buffer function, but exhibited complete chaos and overload characteristics, indicating that its source likely the interphase fragment had experienced a catastrophic collapse of some stable structure under the stimulation of resonance. More noteworthy was that in the tail of the pulse, they indeed separated several extremely weak but structurally seemingly regular data stream segments that appeared to have undergone high-intensity compression.</p>
<p>These data stream fragments are severely damaged and cannot be directly interpreted. But their encoding structure is different from any communication protocol or storage format we know and has obvious discontinuous characteristics that leeway pointed to the distorted waveform on the screen. It asks like a book that has been blown to pieces and the few pieces we picked up only have a few missing strokes on the radicals. To understand them, we may need to know what writing or even language this book uses. Dot.</p>
<p>Such an focused on assessing the impact of the pulse on the environment. The instantaneous electromagnetic disturbance and infrasound impact caused by the pulse resulted in brief but significant water disturbances and biological stress responses in the surrounding waters. Our monitoring network shows that after the pulse within a 50 nautical mile radius of the incident site, the biological activity deviation index at multiple monitoring points showed brief spikes. Some deep sea fish rose to the surface and large schools of small fish in shallow waters fled in panic. However, these effects are rapidly subsiding and no signs of long-term ecological damage have been observed so far.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chanduwa&#x27;s intelligence network, like a spiderweb shaken by the events, was capturing the ripples of reactions from all sides to the incident. Dragon Souls response was the fastest and most official. Less than 2 hours after the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood sent out their distress signal, a humanitarian relief and accident investigation flotillaa composed of a hospital ship, engineering rescue vessels, and escort ships departed port in a high-profile manner heading directly towards the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base. Dragon Souls official statement was carefully worded, emphasizing a responsible attitude based on jointly addressing natural disasters and technological risks and international obligations to maintain maritime security and stability and stated that it would conduct necessary personnel rescue, technical assessment, and environmental monitoring in the accident area. It sounds grand, but they acted swiftly.</p>
<p>They not only wanted to be at the scene of the accident as soon as possible to assess the damage and obtain firsthand data, but also wanted to take this opportunity to observe closely and even enter the core base of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Chin duo duo analyzed. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is currently suffering in silence. With their base damaged and personnel injured, it would be unreasonable for them to refuse Dragon Souls rescue. So, they have no choice but to open a gate.</p>
<p>This may be the opportunity that Dragon Soul has been waiting for. The reactions of other major powers were more nuanced. Several organizations that had potential rivals to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood or had long coveted their technology began to gather their ships and reconnaissance forces around the accident area, but remained on the edge of international waters, observing without daring to approach Rashley. Clearly, they all wanted a share of the spoils, but were wary of the dragon soul&#x27;s powerful intervention and the potential dangers lingering from the accident itself. Rumors about a massive energy explosion in the Devil&#x27;s Sea and the triggering of an ancient curse have resurfaced among the survivors, triggering a new wave of panic buying of supplies and flight path avoidance.</p>
<p>Some trade routes that were originally closed to the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood base have been temporarily disrupted. After issuing that warning of the breakage, Vera&#x27;s team disappeared completely again. It was as if their only mission was to issue an alert and then they vanished back into the mist. After combining internal data analysis and external intelligence, Lynn Mo convened a core meeting. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s adventure ended in a disastrous failure.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo concluded, &quot;This proves that Vera&#x27;s warning was accurate. Active search and resonance reading contain enormous risks that we do not yet fully understand. That interface fragment may be more complex and dangerous than we imagined. It is not a simple information storage disc, but maybe an organ fragment that still has a weak connection with a vast system and possesses some kind of activity or defense mechanism. He paused, then looked at Leeway and Sue Chian.</p>
<p>Your research direction needs further adjustment. Temporarily put aside attempts to decipher the information content of the fragments themselves that may exceed our current capabilities and security boundaries. Shift your focus to the following. First, how to identify and provide early warning of similar ancient artifacts that may have active or unstable structures. Second, assess models of the environmental and ecological chain reactions that such artifact out of control events may trigger, especially long-term chronic effects.</p>
<p>Third, based on this pulse data, try to reverse engineer its possible resonance triggering mechanism, not to imitate it, but to understand its dangerous principles and establish a more comprehensive threat signature database. Understood. Leeway and Sue Chanchia nodded solemnly. This incident made them realize that ignorance and recklessness are equally deadly when facing these ancient creations. Chando Duo Lin Mo turned to the intelligence chief.</p>
<p>Strengthen intelligence gathering on the details of the Dragon Soul Rescue Teams activities at the accident site, especially their interactions with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and any information that may be obtained regarding debris or the cause of the accident. At the same time, closely monitor the subsequent movements of other observing forces and assess whether a new alliance or confrontation pattern has formed as a result. Sure. How? Lyno finally turned to the defense chief. Based on the parameters of this energy pulse event, update our defense plan.</p>
<p>The focus should be on strengthening our protection against highintensity short duration electromagnetic pulses and infrasound shocks, especially the protection of critical electronic equipment and underground bunkers. At the same time, organize an emergency drill based on the scenario of encountering a sudden unknown energy disaster. After the meeting, everyone went their separate ways. The Mo Yuan Pavilion, this sea fortress, did not panic after experiencing a distant shock. Instead, like an experienced chess player, having clearly seen the consequences of an opponent&#x27;s risky move, it calmly began to adjust its own strategy, fortify its position, and consider its next move.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s resonance danger is a reality, and its aftershocks are spreading across political, technological, and psychological levels. This event undoubtedly serves as a wake-up call to all forces harboring ambitions for ancient relics. However, it may also give rise to new changes. Dragon Soul might use this opportunity to infiltrate the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and acquire its technological accumulation. Other forces might accelerate their own research and development of alternative technologies.</p>
<p>And will those beings hidden deep beneath the sea react further to this seemingly imminent explosion? The aftershocks have yet to subside, and new variables have already been injected into this increasingly complex game. Moan Pavilion needs greater patience and keener insight to capture every subtle signal that could potentially determine the future course of events amidst the turmoil. The game of survival is entering a new phase that places greater emphasis on risk identification, long-term assessment, and strategic resolve. They must ensure that when the next resonance occurs, regardless of its origin, Emo Yuan Pavilion has sufficient buffer and room to maneuver. Chapter 1 20 dark room agreement.</p>
<p>The lingering smoke and energy disturbances above the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base had not yet completely dissipated when Dragon Souls humanitarian relief and accident investigation team had already like a precise scalpel cut into this area that had just suffered trauma. Three white ships painted with the dragon soul insignia and a prominent medical cross were mored at the less damaged dock on the outskirts of the base. Personnel in uniform and with efficient manners quickly disembarked carrying a large amount of medical equipment, engineering assessment instruments, and sophisticated scanning devices disguised as environmental monitoring equipment. Moan pavilion continuously observed the rescue operation using highaltitude balloons and long range passive listening devices. The footage showed that the dragon soul personnel demonstrated a high degree of professionalism and discipline.</p>
<p>The medical team guided or rather monitored by members of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood entered the clearly damaged central area building to treat the wounded and assess the damage. The engineering team began safety checks on the damaged energy harvesting arrays and building structures outside the base and the sizable and best equipped technical assessment and environmental monitoring team politely but firmly requested access to the core enclosed factory area where the accident occurred. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was clearly hesitant, but they eventually gave in doshian Doduo looked at the blurry images transmitted back. There were severe burn and distortion marks at the factory entrance. The Dragon Soul members wore the highest level of protective clothing and breathing equipment before entering.</p>
<p>The situation inside is probably not optimistic, though. Over the next 2 days, Dragon Souls rescue team worked with an efficiency bordering on ruthlessness. The wounded were transferred to the medical ship in batches and equipment fragments suspected of containing radiation or energy contamination were carefully sealed, labeled, and transported away. Environmental monitoring data was collected and analyzed in real time. Closed door meetings between the Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood leadership were frequently held in the only relatively intact command building within the base.</p>
<p>Each meeting was conducted with doors and windows tightly closed and communication jamming measures strictly enforced. Although the intelligence network of Mayuan Pavilion could not penetrate these secret talks, it captured some key information from other sources. First, there was the flow of supplies. Dragon Soul supply ships delivered far more special supplies to the base than were needed for medical and engineering repairs. large quantities of rare metals and semiconductor materials for repairing precision electronic components.</p>
<p>Several mobile laboratory modules that were clearly for highle biochemical isolation and hazardous substance analysis and even several core components of tightly wrapped oddly shaped devices that appeared to be large energy stabilization or confinement devices. They re helping the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood repair its core facilities and the most technically demanding part at that she duo duo analyzed this is definitely not just simple humanitarian aid it has deep technological involvement what s the cost secondly there&#x27;s the issue of personnel movement several core technical staff members of the stonemasons brotherhood who survived the accident but were reportedly seriously injured did not return or transfer to public medical facilities after initial treatment. unlike other injured personnel after being taken away by the Dragon Soul medical ship. Instead, they simply disappeared. Meanwhile, within Dragon Souls technical assessment team, several members possessed a distinctly different demeanor from engineers or scientists.</p>
<p>They acted discreetly but with sharp eyes, frequently engaging in formal contact with the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s middle-level management, intelligence exchange, or even subversion and recruitment. Sure. How judge from a military perspective, Dragon Soul is using this opportunity not only to acquire technology, but also to dig out the other side as talent and internal information. Dot. Just as the outside world was closely watching the rescue show between Dragon Soul and the Stonemason Brotherhood, the internal research of Mo Yuan Pavilion made an unexpected but important discovery after adjusting its direction.</p>
<p>While reviewing all reports of abnormal marine life and corresponding environmental monitoring data since the window incident, Sue Chanchian discovered a previously overlooked detail in the areas where marine frenzy event occurred several hours to a day before the outbreak. The concentration of a specific rare earth element ion in the water showed a brief but clear peak. This rare earth element is not a common pollutant. It is sparssely distributed in nature and its abnormal enrichment is usually related to specific geological activities or industrial emissions. We examined all possible natural sources of disturbance such as nearby hydrothermal vents, river input, and even atmospheric deposition, but none of them could explain this short-term localized spike, Sue Chian said, pointing to the data charts until Leewi suggested, could it be related to those debris? They immediately retrieved the spectral data of the debris brought back by Shadow of the Storm and the residue analysis of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood accident pulse.</p>
<p>Indirectly extracted from fragments of the publicly available environmental monitoring report from Dragon Soul. The comparison revealed that both the tiny debris and the large piece of wreckage contained this specific rare earth element in their material composition and in an abnormal proportion. This element may be a crucial component of some key energy conversion or structural material in those ancient creations libe dusa when they are active damaged or collapse as in the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood experiment. Trace amounts of this element are released into the surrounding environment and it may have an extremely strong yet still unknown effect on the nervous system or circadian rhythms of certain marine organisms. This discovery directly links deep sea anomalies with biological frenzy, providing a crucial intermediate variable for understanding the ecological impacts of environmental disturbances.</p>
<p>It means that monitoring changes in the concentration of this specific rare earth element could become a new indicator for early warning of the activity level or accident risk of deep sea anomalies. Just as Mo Yuan Pavilion was thrilled by this discovery and began to incorporate it into the environmental early warning model, Chin Duodo delivered some major intelligence about the results of the secret talks between Dragon Soul and the Stonemason Brotherhood. The intelligence didn&#x27;t come from direct wiretapping, but rather from a seasoned informant embedded in a logistic supply system within Dragon Soul. This information was pieced together from fragmented conversations among lowranking members outside the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s base gathered over drinks. While the details were vague, the core information was shocking.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood reached several secret agreements. In exchange for Dragon Soul providing comprehensive rescue, technical repair support, and security guarantees, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood agreed to first grant Dragon Soul access to some of its non-core research archives regarding ancient energy pattern classification and basic theory of resonance reading technology. Second, allow Dragon Soul experts to participate to a limited extent in the follow-up analysis of the accident debris, including the large fragment that caused the accident, and share some safe and controllable analysis data. Third, in the near future, its maritime activities, especially those involving the exploration of ancient remains, will be informed to Dragon Soul in advance and subject to safety advice, which is essentially equivalent to accepting a certain kind of technical supervision and action reporting from Dragon Soul. Fourth, tacitly allow Dragon Soul to recruit some core technical personnel who were injured in the accident or who felt confused about the future of the organization.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul promised to help the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood repair its core facilities, provide a certain level of resources and technical support to maintain its operation, and within reasonable limits, provide protection for its base from other opportunistic forces, a treaty of surrender. After listening to the report, Linmo said slowly, &quot;In order to survive and preserve their last bit of research capital, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood was forced to open its doors to Dragon Soul and relinquish some of its autonomy. Dragon Soul in turn achieved deep penetration and technological harvesting of its long-term competitor without bloodshed, acting as a rescuer, and also incorporated a potential source of technological risk into its regulatory system. A win-win situation, but Dragon Soul wins more. Chin Duo commented, &quot;The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood will probably find it difficult to act independently as before.</p>
<p>They may become Dragon Souls peripheral laboratory or risk probe in the field of ancient technology research.&quot; &quot;What does this mean for us?&quot; Such Chanchin asked. &quot;This signifies a major shift in the world of ancient technological exploration.&quot; Leewi pondered. The independent and mysterious Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood has been weakened and absorbed, greatly strengthening Dragon Souls orthodox research capabilities, resulting in a higher concentration of resources and technology. Any other forces attempting to enter this field will face a more powerful, organized, and dangerous opponent. Simultaneously, by controlling the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, Dragon Soul may also have gained more firstirhand information about deep sea anomalies, interface fragments, and related risks.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo walked to the nautical chart, his gaze sweeping over the markers representing Dragon Soul, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, and the Misty Bay of the Southwest. The dark chamber agreement has been reached, and a new balance is forming. Dragon Souls strength and influence are growing and their desire for control over the overall situation will also increase. We need to reassess our strategy for technical exchanges with Dragon Soul. We must not interrupt this valuable information channel, but we must also be wary of being drawn into an overly tight cooperation framework and losing our autonomy.</p>
<p>He paused, then continued. At the same time, the upheaval in the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood may spur other factions, especially those who also have ambitions for ancient technology, but lack the connections to take more aggressive or covert actions. The remnants of the Wings of Liberty in the southwest, Varys team in the east, and even shadowy forces we haven&#x27;t yet detected may all adjust their strategies. As a result, the situation may enter a new normal that appears calm on the surface, but is actually more turbulent underneath. In the shadows, the agreement was signed.</p>
<p>The line between light and shadow seemed to blur. Rescue and annexation, cooperation and control, lay separated by a mere inch. As both an observer and participant in this grand game, Mo Yuan Pavilion had to more clearly discern the true intentions and leverage of each player, navigating the increasingly intricate network of interests to find a narrow path that would both acquire knowledge and preserve itself. The storm may have temporarily subsided, but beneath the surface, new undercurrents were quietly forming, even before the ink on the agreement was dry. Chapter 1, 21.</p>
<p>Deep Sea Glimmer. The secret agreement between Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood acted as a powerful catalyst, rapidly altering the technological exploration landscape of the surrounding waters. The once independent and mysterious Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, now under Dragon Souls assistance and supervision, had its activities become relatively predictable, yet also exhibited a more unsettling degree of coordination. The Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s monitoring network detected a significant change in the energy output pattern of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base. After initial repairs, the previously relatively stable and self-sufficient tidal and geothermal energy harvesting arrays are now intermittently transmitting highdensity energy packets to a northern research hub controlled by Dragon Soul.</p>
<p>This transmission is not continuous, but occurs every few days, lasting several hours each time, during which the electromagnetic shielding around the base is noticeably enhanced. Are they transmitting processed energy or are they smuggling data through the energy flow? Chin Duo Duo analyzed the monitoring data. Dragon Soul may have set up a blackbox facility there to process and analyze the technical data and samples obtained from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. This regular energy transmission can both maintain the operation of the facility and may also be a highly encrypted method of data transmission. Meanwhile, Dragon Souls own deep sea exploration operations after integrating some of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s technology became more systematic and daring.</p>
<p>Several mixed research teams led by Dragon Soul and accompanied by Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood technical advisers began conducting detailed grid-like surveys of several previously marked areas with frequent deep sea anomaly activity. They use a new type of composite sonar array with precisely adjustable power and frequency, emitting more complex sound signals than before, seemingly containing multiple preset interrogation modes. They&#x27;re trying to have a more complex and secure dialogue with those debris. Leeway analyzed the characteristics of the intercepted sonar signals. Based on the lessons learned from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood incident, their current signal design has clearly incorporated more security, redundancy, and interruption mechanisms.</p>
<p>This is not a crude resonance excitation, but more like a cautious attempt at multiband authentication. These exploration efforts have yielded some initial results. According to remote monitoring by the Mo Yuan Pavilion and scientific research findings intentionally leaked by some dragon souls, new patterns have begun to emerge in the aggregation behavior of deep sea luminescent debris in the key exploration areas. They are no longer simply drifting randomly or responding to a single stimulus, but rather under the stimulation of specific frequency soundwave sequences. They briefly form simple repetitive geometric patterns such as rings, spirals, and even rudimentary fractal structures.</p>
<p>These patterns last for an extremely short time, typically only a few seconds to a dozen seconds before dissipating and the debris returns to its disordered state. These patterns, Dante, seem to have formed naturally. Sue Chanchian looked at the blurry images captured by the highsensitivity deep sea camera. Although simple, their symmetry and repetition strongly suggest the existence of some kind of program or rule behind them. These debris, even if they&#x27;re just metabolic waste or structural fragments, may have a more complex information structure than we imagined and may be able to exhibit low-level self-organizing behavior under specific external stimuli.</p>
<p>Dot. More notably, whenever this brief pattern forms, the concentration of specific rare earth element ions in that area, as recorded by the Moyuang monitoring network, exhibits a synchronous subtle peak. This further confirms the close connection between these rare earth elements and ancient creation activities. They&#x27;re like a kind of tracer Leeway summarized and also a byproduct of some kind of energy metabolism. Monitoring their concentration changes and spatial distribution may help us infer those deeper system activities that we cannot see.</p>
<p>Dot inside the Mo Yuan pavilion. Based on these new discoveries, the environmental early warning model is undergoing another significant upgrade. The newly added modules, self-organizing behavior recognition of deep sea anomalies and spatial concentration gradient analysis of specific rare earth elements, have begun multi-dimensional correlation analysis with existing indicators such as energy disturbances and biological anomalies. The model&#x27;s complexity is increasing exponentially and the demand for computing resources is also growing. Leeway has had to request more higherformance computing core units obtained through daily login rewards to support the model&#x27;s operation.</p>
<p>Just as Moyuan was focused on technical observation and model building, an old friend in the southwest once again attracted attention in an unexpected way. After a long period of stillness and occasional faint pulsations, a dramatic change occurred in the direction of Misty Bay on a windless dawn. The first to detect the anomaly was a high altitude monitoring balloon deployed by Moyuan Pavilion 150 nautical miles from a bay. Its highresolution optical sensor captured the thick cotton-like fog that had shrouded the bay for months, beginning to churn and thin at a visible rate. As if an invisible hand was stirring it, a hole began to appear in the fog from its center and rapidly expanded outwards.</p>
<p>As the thick fog dissipated, the outline of the massive silent fortress deep in the bay was revealed more clearly than ever before in the morning light. It was a complex complex of buildings made of metal, rock, and unknown composite materials filled with sharp geometric lines and huge pipes. The towering cylindrical structure at the center still stood, but its surface seemed to have many new ancillary structures and external supports, making it look more intricate than when shadow of the storm scouted it. However, this clear view lasted for less than an hour. Just as all the monitoring points of myuan pavilion were recording with all their might, a point of intense white light suddenly appeared on the top of the cylindrical structure in the center of the fortress without any warning.</p>
<p>The white light was not continuous, but flashed three times an extremely high frequency. Each flash accompanied by an energy pulse of low intensity, but with extremely unique frequency characteristics. After the pulse, the already spread fog seemed to be rewound and began to gather and thicken again at a faster speed. In just over 10 minutes, it tightly enveloped the entire bay again, restoring its former impenetrability. The whole process was brief and eerie, as if the sleeping behemoth had only briefly opened its eyes, scanned the world around it, and then closed the curtain again.</p>
<p>What did those three flashes and pulses mean? Sure, how stared at the pulse waveform recorded by the sensor. It doesn&#x27;t look like an attack, nor like the weak pulses that maintained dormcancy before. It&#x27;s more like a signal flare or a state change notification. Chin Duo Duo quickly mobilized the intelligence network. Several small merchant fleets and fishing boats in the surrounding waters witnessed the dissipation of a dense fog and the flashes of light causing a small-cale commotion and speculation.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul has not made any public comment, but we have detected that one of their rapid response fleets adjusted its patrol route to the southwest after the incident, but did not approach the bay. Leewi and Sue Chian carefully analyzed the energy characteristics of the three pulses. The frequency components are very concentrated mainly falling within the characteristic frequency bands we previously identified that are related to energy buffer and safety node. But the modulation method is very special like a kind of counting or state coding. Such Chian tried to perceive the rhythmic residue left by the pulses.</p>
<p>It feels very mechanical and certain without emotional fluctuations just like a machine announcing self- test complete status code triple X. The remnants of the wings of Liberty after undergoing unknown internal changes suddenly sent out a clear but ambiguous signal. What does this signify? Is internal debugging complete? Is a new operation imminent? Or is it some kind of reaction to a series of external changes such as the agreement between Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood and the upgrade of Deep Sea Exploration? Lynn Mo synthesized all the information and paced around the command room. The faint glowing patterns of the deep sea, the brief opening of the bay&#x27;s eyes, the accelerated integration of the dragon&#x27;s soul and its technological probing this world was becoming increasingly active. Various hidden systems seem to be responding in different ways to the continuous environmental disturbances and humanity&#x27;s increasingly in-depth exploration.</p>
<p>Maintain the highest level of observation, but do not take any action that could be interpreted as a response. Lynn Mo finally ordered. Whether it&#x27;s the deep sea glow or the Gulf signal, silence is the best shield until we truly understand its meaning and intention. Continue to improve our early warning model. Meanwhile, Chi and Duo Duo, I need to know the true reaction and assessment of Dragon Souls top management regarding this Gulf incident at any cost.</p>
<p>He gazed southwestward at the sea, now shrouded in thick fog once more, his eyes deep and unfathomable. What was brewing beneath that mist? And what ancient secrets did those shimmering fragments in the deep sea whisper? Mo Yuan Pavilion stood like an observer before countless slowly opening doors. each door emitting different sounds and revealing different glimmers of light. He had to maintain absolute calm and patience, discerning which were the sounds of the wind, footsteps, and the very breath of the abyss itself. A glimmer of light in the deep sea, a fleeting glimpse through the mist.</p>
<p>These are but the tip of the iceberg quietly revealing the awakening world. And beneath that iceberg lies hope or a greater calamity. The answer may lie hidden in each subsequent careful observation and common analysis. Never before has the survival strategy of AMO Yuan Pavilion relied so heavily on a keen ear to the silence and a profound understanding of even the faintest glimmers of light. Chapter 1 22 New Guests arrive.</p>
<p>The name coral society was like a pebble thrown into a deep pool creating considerable ripples within the intelligence assessment system of the Mo Yuan pavilion. Shen Duo Duo mobilized all available resources attempting to sketch out the outline of this suddenly emerging organization in a short period of time. However, the feedback was surprisingly scarce. This organization appears to be extremely lowprofile, or rather, its core area of activity and membership exceeds the coverage of the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s existing intelligence network. The few vague clues available suggest they may have originated in the more remote southeastern region, a complex sea area known as the labyrinth of Thousand Islands, a place dotted with islands and treacherous waterways.</p>
<p>Historically, a preferred hiding place for various small factions and hermits. The Coral Society rarely participates in mainstream trade or power struggles, but occasionally their agents can be seen at highly exclusive secret auctions and academic exchanges involving ancient documents or rare materials, acquiring specific items with astonishing financial resources and expert insight, only to disappear swiftly after the transaction. They re like a group of ghost fish in the deep sea, only occasionally catching a glimpse of us when they surface to breathe. She and Duo Duo reported to Len Mo, her tone tinged with helplessness. They have no fixed stronghold markers, no publicly available member list, and their style of operation is even more secretive than the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood.</p>
<p>They came to us on their own initiative and with a gift that we couldn&#x27;t te refuse, so their intentions must be quite significant. Then Mo pondered at this sensitive moment when the Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood had reached a new balance. When an unknown signal was emanating from a southwest bay, and when the faint light in the deep sea concealed hidden secrets, the sudden visit of such a mysterious organization could not be a coincidence. The intact artifact components and ancient energy harmonic stabilization technology in their possession, whether genuine or not, directly address the core bottleneck of the Mo Yuan pavilion&#x27;s current research. Arrange a meeting.</p>
<p>Linmo finally decided the location will be our outermost seven trade outpost where the terrain is complex making it easy to monitor and evacuate. The other side can only send one ship with no more than five people. Chin duo duo you will personally receive them while Show will lead a team to provide support from the outside to ensure safety. Leeway sue Chian and I will observe from the rear. Understood.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo and Shirha replied simultaneously. The seven trading outpost is located in a secluded fjord about 80 nautical miles southwest of the main island. The surrounding area is riddled with reefs and only one manmarked secret waterway is accessible. Several simple but sturdy wooden peers and houses have been built in the fjord which are usually used for trading with small caravans with clean backgrounds and also serve as an intelligence relay station. The meeting was scheduled for noon 2 days later.</p>
<p>The weather was fine that day with excellent visibility. The Coral Society&#x27;s vessel arrived as promised. It was a medium-sized two-masted sailing ship, long and sleek, meticulously maintained, painted an inconspicuous gray blue without any flags or markings. It glided silently into the fjord along the marked waterway like a ghost, and mured steadily beside the outermost pier. for people disembarked from the ship.</p>
<p>The leader was a man who appeared to be in his 40s with a refined and calm demeanor. He wore a set of dark gray cotton linen clothes suitable for movement and a pair of glasses with crystal lenses. He introduced himself as Mu, the external liaison director of the Coral Society. Behind him were three men. One was burly and had a steady gaze, seemingly a bodyguard.</p>
<p>The other two carried two boxes of different sizes covered in special leather and appear to be technicians. Chandu Duo was already waiting under the awning by the pier and greeted him with the usual warm smile of a businessman. After exchanging a few pleasantries, the atmosphere seemed harmonious, but both sides were on high alert. Manager Chin, it&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you. I&#x27;ve long admired the achievements of Mayu Pavilion in environmental monitoring and the analysis of ancient symbols.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve taken the liberty of visiting you today in the hope of establishing an exchange relationship based on shared interests and pragmatic considerations. Mus voice was calm and his pace was unhurried. Director Zhao, you&#x27;re too kind. Our Moyuan Pavilion is just a small, humble establishment doing business to make a living and occasionally showing an interest in old objects. We&#x27;ve long admired your esteemed association.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo chuckled, her words perfectly tactful. Mu smiled slightly, seemingly unconcerned by Chiandu&#x27;s platitudes and cut straight to the point. To show our sincerity, we have brought a small gift with us, which may be of some help to your current research. He gestured for the technician behind him carrying a smaller box to come forward and carefully open the box on the wooden table in the pavilion. The box was lined with black velvet, and in the center lay an object.</p>
<p>It was an irregularly shaped dark silver metal component, roughly the size of two fists. Its surface covered with intricate grooves and protrusions as well as numerous tiny holes arranged in a complex array. On several cross-sections of the component, one could see layers of thin sheet-like structures as thin as cicada wings and connecting lines as fine as hair. Most strikingly, at the center of the component was a deep blue crystal the size of a fingernail with a polyhedral structure. Inside the crystal, a faint nebula-like mist seemed to be slowly rotating.</p>
<p>This is a surviving core unit of an ancient resonator array, Mu explained. Although it is only a small part of the complete array, and its energy is nearly depleted, its internal structure is basically intact, especially the tuning crystal and the surrounding waveguide patterns, which are quite well preserved. We believe it will be very helpful for your understanding of the generation and control principles of ancient energy harmonics. Leewi, who had been observing from behind using hidden cameras and audio equipment, almost stopped breathing the moment he saw the component. The characteristics of the crystal, the style of the waveguide pattern and the hemlock island slabs, metal scraps, and even the dragon soul key crystal were all intricately connected yet far more refined and complete.</p>
<p>This was a genuine ancient artifact component that transcended the category of waste. Such Chian also stared intently at the screen, trying to sense it, but only felt an extremely restrained, almost dormant sense of order, like a sophisticated musical instrument that was only temporarily silent. Chandu Duo showed a suitable expression of surprise and interest. Oh my, this is truly a rare item. Director Zhao&#x27;s gift is far too generous.</p>
<p>Zhao Mu waved his hand. The gift is just a stepping stone. What we really hope to cooperate on is something else. He asked another technician to open the larger box. Inside were no physical items, only a thick bound file and several special chips for storing data.</p>
<p>This is part of the basic theoretical and algorithmic framework of our environmental energy harmonic dynamic stability model that we have summarized after years of long-term observation of multiple deep sea energy anomaly areas that mu tone became serious. We have noticed that your side seems to be building a similar early warning model. Our model may complement yours in some aspects. For example, how to identify and filter out interference signals caused by passive scattering of inactive debris. how to more accurately track the active transport path of specific rare earth elements and how to preliminarily determine whether the core of a deep sea energy anomaly area is a dormant ruin or a low power operating facility.</p>
<p>These words directly hit the weakest and most pressing areas of Moan G&#x27;s current model. The other party clearly has a deep understanding of Mo Yuan G&#x27;s research direction and progress. Chindwood&#x27;s smile faded slightly and she became cautious. Director Zhao seems to know a lot about our work. It&#x27;s just some reasonable speculation based on publicly available information and our attention to similar researchers.</p>
<p>Zhao Mu frankly stated, &quot;The association&#x27;s mission is to seek lost order in the glimmer of the deep sea. We believe that facing this ancient world that is awakening, any solo effort is dangerous. Knowledge needs to be shared and risks need to be shared. We provide technology and samples in exchange for your high temporal resolution data on the correlation between environmental energy fields and biological behavior obtained from long-term monitoring in specific areas such as the area around the Misty Bay in southwest China. The combination of our data may allow us to make earlier and more accurate predictions about the state changes of certain sensitive nodes.</p>
<p>He proposed clear terms for the exchange. In exchange for core ancient components and advanced environmental analysis models, he would acquire Muan Pavilion&#x27;s exclusive monitoring data in the southwest bay area. Linmo listened quietly from the command vehicle in the back. The other side&#x27;s objective was clear, the offer tempting, and it pointed directly to the most critical and ambiguous area of the current situation, the Southwest Bay. This coral society had an extraordinary interest in what was happening in the bay.</p>
<p>This matter is of great importance and cannot be decided by me alone. Chin Duo Duo responded according to the pre-arranged plan. We will study and evaluate director Zhao&#x27;s proposal and gift in detail. Please rest on the ship for a while. We need some time to discuss this internally.</p>
<p>Dot. That&#x27;s only right that Zhao nodded politely, then returned to the sailboat with his entourage and waited patiently. Inside the pavilion, Chi and Duadu carefully closed the two boxes and quickly took them back to the rear. Leewi and Sue Chanchian immediately conducted a preliminary but detailed examination of the components and documents. The component is real.</p>
<p>The ingenuity of its internal structure far surpasses any sample weave obtained before. Although the crystal has weak energy, its physical structure and possible optical properties are revolutionary for our understanding of the key and resonance. The model&#x27;s data framework is very advanced. We&#x27;ve never thought of many of the algorithmic approaches, but they&#x27;re logically consistent and some of the reference data matches what we have. Such Chanchian quickly browsed through the documents.</p>
<p>If the framework they provided is genuine, our model&#x27;s performance can be improved by at least an order of magnitude. The temptation is immense, but the risks are equally clear. Providing detailed monitoring data for the southwest bay could expose the capabilities and deployment preferences of the Mo Yuan go monitoring network and might even indirectly reveal their understanding of the structures within the bay. Moreover, what is the true purpose of this coral society? Is it merely for research or does it intend to use the Mo Yuan G&#x27;s data to take some kind of action against the bay? Their target is likely something in the Gulf. Lynn Mo said in internal communications, &quot;They&#x27;re trading our muchneeded technology and samples for the intelligence key to the target area.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a deal, but behind it, they&#x27;re flexing their muscles and testing our bottom line and needs.&quot; He quickly weighed the pros and cons. The value of the components and model framework was tangible and it could greatly accelerate the technological accumulation of Mayuan Pavilion. Although the data from the Southwest Bay was sensitive, it could be carefully processed to remove core secrets and provide a research data set that have been timeshifted and parameter blurred. Agree to their terms, Lynn, Emo decided, but the data exchange must be done in phases. We will first provide the first part of processed historical data on the correlation between macroscopic fluctuations in the energy field around the Gulf and regional biological migration patterns in exchange for detailed 3D scan data of the first half of their model framework and its components.</p>
<p>Subsequent exchanges will be discussed based on the results of the first phase of cooperation and the level of trust between the two parties. At the same time, all exchange data must be encrypted and completed through disposable media to cut off any possibility of backtracking. This is a cautious, gradual exploration of cooperation. It aims to acquire muchneeded resources while controlling risks and retaining the option to terminate the cooperation at any time. Chin Duodo met with Mu again with a revised cooperation plan.</p>
<p>Mu seemed unsurprised by the proposal for a phased exchange and readily agreed to the first phase. The two parties quickly signed a simplified agreement written in complex encrypted language and completed the first exchange of data and sample scan data. After completing the handover, the Coral Society sailboat did not linger and quickly sailed away from the fjord, disappearing into the distant sea. Mo Yuan Pavilion acquired valuable physical samples and a theoretical framework, but also welcomed a new, more mysterious and purposeful partner. Meanwhile, beneath the thick fog of the Southwest Bay, this distant data transaction seemed to have inadvertently attracted even more attention.</p>
<p>In a glimmer of the deep sea, a new player quietly made his move, and the old game was undergoing unpredictable changes. Chapter 1. 23 new interpretations of ancient artifacts. The dark silver metal component left behind by the coral society along with a thick stack of technical documents were like two pieces of high purity fuel thrown into the research furnace of the ink abyss pavilion quickly igniting fiery and brilliant sparks of thought. After strict security isolation and multiple tests, the component was carefully transferred to Leeway and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s main laboratory.</p>
<p>The components were placed in a speciallyesed inert gas chamber equipped with various scanning and micromanipulation devices. Leeway almost pressed his face against the observation window, his eyes gleaming with fascination. Look at the direction of these wavegu patterns. They&#x27;re not planer, they&#x27;re three-dimensional. They intersect and couple between layers at different depths, forming a three-dimensional resonant cavity structure we&#x27;ve never imagined before.</p>
<p>In this tuning crystal, he pointed to the deep blue polyhedrin slowly rotating with nebulous light. Its facet angles and the rotation axis of its internal halo seem to have a strict geometric correspondence with specific nodes of the surrounding patterns. This is definitely not decoration. It&#x27;s the core of energy focusing and frequency control for the entire resonant unit. Such an tried to approach the component with her unique sense of rhythm.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, her fingers hovering over the control box, her brows slightly furrowed. It&#x27;s very quiet, but not dead still. Like a deep well, the water is calm, but you can feel the slow, unreachable undercurrens deep below. The patterns don&#x27;t feel like pipes to me, but more like strings or tuning forks waiting to be plucked by fingers at a specific frequency. And that crystal is the tuning hammer and also the resonator.</p>
<p>The two quickly divided the tasks. Leeway led the team utilizing all available non-destructive testing methods, high precision X-ray, computed tomography, micro area laser spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference magnetometers to collect comprehensive data on the component. The goal was to construct a complete three-dimensional digital model and analyze its material composition and possible residual energy field characteristics. Such Chian led another group to study the framework materials of the environmental energy harmonic dynamic stability model provided by the coral society. The Coral Society&#x27;s model framework ingenious and advanced beyond Mo Yuan G&#x27;s expectations did not attempt to explain all phenomena with a single theory.</p>
<p>Instead, it constructed a multi-layered scalable explanation prediction system. The foundational layer consists of a vast database of environmental parameters and feature extraction algorithms. The intermediate layer comprises multiple parallel computational models based on different physical assumptions such as geoysical resonance, biogeeochemical cycle coupling and unknown energy field interference. And the top layer is a complex model selection and weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically adjusts the confidence weights of different underlying models based on the characteristics of real-time input data providing a comprehensive risk assessment and trend prediction. The most impressive aspect of this framework lies in its learning and adapting capabilities.</p>
<p>Sue Chian reported at the analysis meeting, &quot;It has a built-in feedback loop that can use the deviation between the predicted results and the actual observations to back optimize the feature extraction algorithm and model way allocation. Although we only have the framework and lack the core historical data they might use for training, its design philosophy itself is extremely inspiring. In particular, their proposed living transport path tracking algorithm and facility dormcancy assessment index provide us with a completely new tool and perspective for understanding deep sea rare earth element anomalies and judging the state of relics. Just as Leewi and Sue Chian were immersed in the excitement brought by the new technology, Shindwood&#x27;s intelligence network continued to transmit back every little thing happening in the outside world. The cooperation between Dragon Soul and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood seems to have entered a relatively stable honeymoon period.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energybased repair work is basically complete. And with Dragon Souls technical support, its energy output efficiency and stability have even improved compared to before the accident. In return, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood has granted Dragon Soul access to some non-core research files and tacitly allowed Dragon Souls expert team advisers to be permanently stationed at the base participating in some peripheral data analysis projects. However, according to fragmented information from inside sources, the large interface fragment remnant that caused the accident, as well as the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s most core resonance reading technologies, remain tightly guarded in a separate isolated area deep within the base, untouchable by Dragon Souls experts to this day. Dragon Soul is very patient.</p>
<p>They are waiting and slowly infiltrating, Chien Duo judged. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, on the other hand, is trying its best to maintain a technical firewall under the guise of cooperation. How long this delicate balance can last depends on Dragon&#x27;s soleless appetite and how many Trump cards the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood still has died. After that brief signal, the Misty Bay in the southwest returned to absolute silence. The thick fog remained as still as a wall.</p>
<p>The monitoring points set up by my UN pavilion in the surrounding area, aside from continuously recording the faint but stable background noise and the occasional breathing pulsations synchronized with global energy background fluctuations made no further discoveries. However, a retrospective analysis of historical data based on the facility dormcancy index within the coral society&#x27;s model framework showed that the dormcy of the structures within the bay had been slowly but steadily declining over the past few months, gradually sliding from initial deep dormcancy towards the edge of shallow standby. It hasn&#x27;t he woke up, but it seems to be getting easier to wake up, Sue Chian said, pointing to the analysis charts with a worried tone. In a wider area of the ocean, the microluminescent patterns phenomenon, which are briefly formed by deep sea anomalies, has become increasingly frequent, and the patterns have become slightly more complex under the continuous inquiry of the Dragon Soul Hybrid scientific expedition team. Meanwhile, the Moy Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s monitoring network confirmed that the abnormal concentration fluctuations of specific rare earth element ions are highly spatiotemporally correlated with the occurrence of these pattern events and that their concentration peaks and distribution ranges show a slow expanding trend.</p>
<p>All of this points to one conclusion. The system beneath the deep sea is becoming more active and its responses to external stimuli are becoming more rich. 7 days later, Leewayi&#x27;s team completed a preliminary analysis report on the components of the Coral Society. The results were encouraging, but also brought more mysteries. The component is made of a highly composite crystal metal ceramic layered structure, and its manufacturing process is completely beyond the comprehension of modern metallurgy.</p>
<p>The three-dimensional model shows that its internal three-dimensional waveguide patterns form an extremely complex resonant network with fractal characteristics. Preliminary analysis suggests that the tuning crystal may be a synthetic mineral with special nonlinear optical properties and pisoelectric effects capable of efficiently converting mechanical vibrations sound waves of specific frequencies into electromagnetic waves of specific wavelengths and vice versa. This is a sophisticated soundlight electricity conversion and control hub. Leeway summarized. It is likely a single pixel or channel in a larger array.</p>
<p>Based on the inverse deduction of the texture structure and crystal parameters, its most sensitive input frequency has a disturbing overlap with several key dangerous frequencies that we previously recorded in the window event and a dragon soul knocking event. This means that the ancient resonator core unit provided by the coral society is likely designed to handle or generate dangerous frequencies that could trigger violent reactions in ancient systems. It is both a key to understanding ancient energy technology and a potentially dangerous instrument if improperly played. Do they give this to us because they thought we wouldn&#x27;t understand it or because they believe we wouldn&#x27;t do anything reckless? Such an asked a pointed question. Lynn Mo carefully reviewed all the analysis reports and intelligence summaries.</p>
<p>The Coral Society&#x27;s gift was of immense value, but the information it contained was equally profound. They demonstrated unfathomable technological reserves and a precise grasp of the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s needs. Their target was clearly the Southwest Bay, and the tools they provided could both help the Mo Yuan Pavilion better observe the world and potentially inadvertently open Pandora&#x27;s box. continue to delve deeper into the components and model framework, but all experimental simulations involving dangerous frequencies must be conducted in a completely offline closed simulation environment. Any form of physical energy injection testing is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo issued strict instructions. At the same time, prepare for the second phase of data exchange with the coral society. This time we could provide a portion of the interim analysis report on the correlation between energy field disturbances in the periphery of the bay and fluctuations in the population size of specific marine species in the region as well as our preliminary assessment charts of the dormant trend of the bay structure based on their model framework. He paused for a moment, then added, &quot;In the exchange data, we appropriately include some discoveries that we have preliminarily verified, but are not core findings, such as the sensitivity threshold of certain type of plankton to abnormal rare earth element concentrations. This demonstrates our value and also tests their reaction to this type of ecological association information.</p>
<p>Ancient artifacts, though old, hold new principles. models, though simple, convey profound meanings. While acquiring knowledge, the Mo Yuan Pavilion must proceed cautiously, carefully assessing the true value and potential risks of each exchange. This deal with the Coral Society is like exchanging fire with a stranger in a dark forest that could illuminate the path ahead or could set them ablaze. They must ensure that the torches they hold are used only to light the way ahead, not to ignite the entire forest.</p>
<p>Chapter 124. the foundation of sky. The ancient resonator core unit provided by the coral society is like a delicate key. Although it cannot directly open any specific door, it allows the researchers of Mayuan Pavilion to glimpse a corner of the intricate gears within the grand system behind the door. Leeway&#x27;s team is working day and night to analyze the 3D scanning data and material testing reports, attempting to reverse engineer the design logic and possible application scenarios of this soundlight electricity conversion hub.</p>
<p>What is most puzzling is its energy efficiency, Leeway said, pointing to a set of simulation results with a furoughed brow. Based on the material properties and structural model, this component under ideal conditions has an absurdly high energy conversion efficiency for a specific frequency band almost reaching the theoretical limit. Moreover, the energy loss is mainly in the form of weak photon radiation of specific wavelengths and extremely regular thermal vibrations. This means that the system it belongs to controls energy with an almost artistic precision and is by no means the crude brute force we imagined. After a thorough study of the coral society&#x27;s model framework, Sue Chanchian proposed a new integration approach.</p>
<p>If we consider this resonator unit as a basic note, then the coral society&#x27;s model framework is like teaching us how to identify melody and harmony. The core of their framework regarding environmental harmonic stability is actually about identifying and utilizing the inherent relatively stable energy fluctuations in the environment background sounds to calibrate and amplify the abnormal signals we want to monitor. This is logically consistent with the resonator units ability to efficiently identify and convert specific frequency inputs. She proposed combining the coral society&#x27;s algorithmic framework with the energy pattern function mapping already developed by the Mo Yuan Pavilion based on hemlock island slate symbols and dragon soul taxonomy data to create a brand new ancient energy device function and environmental interaction simulation platform. While this platform cannot manufacture any physical objects in a short term, it can simulate the possible behavior patterns of different ancient artifact components under specific environmental energy backgrounds in a virtual environment, thereby more safely assessing their potential functions and risks.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo approved this bold interdisciplinary research plan. It would require a large amount of computing resources and the integration of knowledge from different research groups. But if successful, Emoi Yuan G&#x27;s understanding of ancient technology would move from blind men touching an elephant to a new stage of system modeling. While the internal research was progressing with difficulty, the second phase of data exchange with the Coral Society proceeded as scheduled. This time their requests were more specific.</p>
<p>They wanted complete time frequency analysis data on all low-frequency magnetic field directional pulsations events monitored by Moyuan Pavilion within a 50 nautical mile radius of the southwest Misty Bay over the past 6 months as well as detailed parameters and verification methods for Moyuan Pavilion&#x27;s assessment model of the bay structure dormcy level. In exchange, the Coral Society provided the core algorithm module of their model framework for predicting the critical point of dormant activated state transition in large composite energy structures as well as historical data of environmental baseline energy spectrum supposedly reconstructed from the remains of a sunken ancient coastal observation station. The latter is of extremely high reference value for calibrating the monitoring equipment at Muan Pavilion and eliminating regional background interference. What they wanted was very specialized directly targeting the core of the vital signs monitoring of that thing in the Gulf. Chi and Duo Duo analyzed after the exchange.</p>
<p>Moreover, they seemed very interested in our assessment model itself and wanted to understand our diagnostic approach. This didn&#x27;t t seem like a simple academic exchange. It was more like preparation for some kind of targeted intervention or contact. Lynn Mo agreed with this assessment. The Coral Society&#x27;s focus on the Southwest Bay was unusually persistent and in-depth.</p>
<p>The data and models provided by Mo Yuan Pavilion would likely become key to their risk assessment and formulation of the next steps. This was a mutually beneficial transaction, but its ultimate outcome might point to an action that Moan Pavilion was currently unable to control or participate in. strengthen the security of our own monitoring network around the Gulf and upgrade the encryption level of all data transmission links, Lynn Mo instructed. At the same time, use the environmental baseline energy spectrum provided by the Coral Society to recalibrate all our monitoring equipment and improve the reliability and comparability of the data. We must ensure that the data we send out is valuable.</p>
<p>But we must also sharpen our own eyes even more. Beneath the seemingly calm surface, new variables are brewing in the external world regarding Dragon Soul. After initially digesting the technological insights gained from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, its official research institution released a significant report, the preliminary assessment white paper on the distribution and activity of potential ancient energy nodes on the global seafloor. This report for the first time systematically correlates geologically active areas such as mid ocean ridges, trenches, and submarine volcanic chains with historically and recently monitored environmental energy anomalies based on the energy characteristics, activity frequency, and contribution to environmental disturbances of these nodes. It classifies and assesses their risks.</p>
<p>The report identifies the area where the southwest misty bay is located as a level three activity node anomalous state. Suspected non-natural energy accumulation activity pattern inconsistent with known geological processes requires continued monitoring. Meanwhile, the ice flow fissures are designated as a level two activity. Node clear energy characteristics significant recent human disturbance potentially high risk. Through this approach, Dragon Soul demonstrates its powerful global monitoring and research capabilities while simultaneously laying the groundwork for future actions in terms of public opinion and technology.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the Dragon Soul, the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood cautiously restarted small-cale deep sea sampling operations. However, their targets were no longer active anomalies or large debris, but rather relatively quiet deep sea sediments and specific rock straightus samples, seemingly conducting more fundamental research on ancient environmental context and geocchronology. This might be a force transformation, or it could be to accumulate new bargaining power with a dragon soul. In a wider ocean, the specific areas of anomalous rare earth element concentrations are still slowly expanding and are beginning to overlap with some newly discovered extremely slow deep sea circulation anomalies. The upgraded monitoring model from Moyuan suggests that these rare earth elements may be being carried and diffused by some large scale slow water movement and their sources appear to be multiple.</p>
<p>Just as many parties were focusing on the ocean and energy, Linmo made an important decision concerning the long-term development of Mo Yuan Pavilion to officially launch the preliminary research and resource preparation plan for the core template of Sky City. This epic sanctuary template obtained from the sign-in system requires an astronomical list of materials, including a large number of unheard of synthetic materials and special components. Previously, due to external pressure and insufficient technological reserves, it had been sheld. Now, with a deeper understanding of ancient energy technology and the advanced model framework obtained through a trade with the coral society, Lin Mo believes it&#x27;s time to begin laying the foundation for the construction of this ultimate sanctuary. He separated the relatively conventional parts of a template such as the basic structure, energy core, and environmental maintenance system and handed them over to Leewei and Sue Chanchian&#x27;s research group for technical feasibility assessment and alternative material research.</p>
<p>At the same time, he gave Chiand Do the long and staggering list of resources, instructing him to begin collecting information and access channels for relevant materials globally in a most discreet and decentralized manner without rushing for quick results, but to begin planning systematically. Sky City is not just a refuge, Linmo said to everyone at the core meeting. It should be the culmination of all our knowledge, our ultimate fortress against any storms to come. Its construction will be a long process, but every step must be solid. From now on, it will become a long-term core goal of our internal development.</p>
<p>The foundation of the sky begins at your feet. Amidst the turbulent depths of the ocean and the fierce competition among various forces, the Mo Yuan Pavilion has quietly turned its gaze to a higher dimension. They understand that relying solely on islands and observation stations at sea is insufficient to truly establish themselves in this increasingly unstable world. They need a mobile home that transcends the disturbances of the sea, possessing a high degree of autonomy and survivability. And the sky city is precisely the blueprint for this dream.</p>
<p>The deepening of research, the continuation of transactions, external undercurrents, and the launch of ambitious goals constitute the multifaceted rhythm of life at Mo Yuan Pavilion. They&#x27;re like a group of sailors preparing for a storm, simultaneously reinforcing the ship&#x27;s hull, learning navigation, and dreaming of building a colossal vessel, busy, fulfilled, and cautiously optimistic about the future. Ancient mysteries echo beneath the deep sea. While hopes for the future float above, Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s voyage amidst this constant exploration is heading towards a more unknown yet also more expansive tomorrow. Chapter 125 models and resources.</p>
<p>Deep beneath the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s underground core laboratory, a tranquil atmosphere, a mixture of excitement and focus was enveloped. The massive main screen no longer displayed a simple data stream or waveform, but a complex, slowly rotating 3D model composed of countless translucent lines and points of light. At the model center was a high precision digital twin of the dark silver resonator core unit provided by the Coral Society. surrounding it. According to the Coral Society&#x27;s algorithm framework, simulated and rendered environmental energy background fields of different colors and dynamics.</p>

<p>Leeway&#x27;s voice trembled slightly as he gave the instructions to the operator. As commands were input, the model on the screen dynamically changed. The blue green area representing the environmental background field began to fluctuate regularly while the strands of dark gold abnormal flow resembled a group of awakened snakes converging and entwining from the edge of the model towards the core unit model at the center. Their intensity, frequency, and convergence path were highly consistent with the historical data actually monitored by Moyuan Pavilion. Look here, Such Chanchian pointed to several specific waveguide texture nodes around the core unit of the model.</p>
<p>These nodes were emitting a gradually increasing faint glow under the stimulation of the simulated abnormal energy flow. The model predicts that when the frequency components of the abnormal energy flow match the inherent resonant frequencies of these nodes by more than 67%. The unit will enter a preparatory conversion state and the rotation speed of the tuning crystal light missed inside will increase by about 15 times. And based on the residual trace analysis of our physical component scan, the vortex morphology of the light missed inside the crystal does indeed show micro stress characteristics left after long-term high-speed rotation. This is almost a virtual model that confirms that this ancient component was very likely passively or even designed to participate in that global energy disturbance during the historical window event.</p>
<p>It is like a sophisticated stethoscope passively recording certain characteristics of that heartbeat. If we can further refine its resonance parameters and deduce its most sensitive listening frequency in reverse, Lee Ways eyes gleamed, we might be able to filter out those more subtle ancient system whispers that we always wanted to capture but were drowned out by background noise. This is the groundbreaking perspective brought about by integrating the coral society&#x27;s model framework with ancient material data. It is not just an analytical tool, but more like a powerful lens, allowing them to examine environmental data that has long been recorded, but has always been incomprehensible from a completely new angle. Meanwhile, Chandwa&#x27;s task of laying the groundwork for the Sky City project was also proceeding intensively yet discreetly.</p>
<p>The epic list of materials was dismantled, reassembled, and mixed into a large number of unrelated ordinary trade orders. The names of the previously unheard of synthetic materials on the list were given disguised code names. Highdimensional phase stabilized alloy became special corrosion resistant marine steel plate. Experimental batch on the purchase order. Environmentally adaptive biop-olymer substrate became new waterproof canvas coating raw material.</p>
<p>through several unrelated trading agents and shell companies. Chin Duo Duo posted scattered and restrained purchase requests on major trading hubs and black markets under various pretexts such as researching new building materials, developing high performance codings, and even exploring new materials for artistic creation. The reaction is more complicated than expected. Chanduo reported to Lyn Mo, &quot;There are several materials such as crystallized earth vein core fragments and directionally condensed stardust powder that have absolutely no market records, not even similar rumors. Either the names are too ancient or too obscure, or the actual items may be held by a very small number of more secretive forces or ruins that we have not yet come into contact with.&quot; In addition, he added, &quot;When we tentatively sought to purchase the high purity resonant crystal blank, the basic energy lens rough on the list, we attracted several unusual inquiries.</p>
<p>Not only did traders with dragon soul backgrounds come to inquire about its use, but even an outside agent of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood made roundabout inquiries. This thing seems to be a sensitive item, even in high-tech circles. This was expected. Some of the core materials needed for Sky City inevitably overlap with the ancient technologies currently sought by top powers. Any large-scale unusual procurement could expose their intentions and strength.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo instructed Shin Duo Duo to suspend the public purchase of those materials that were both elusive and overly sensitive and instead through intelligence networks secretly gather all historical records and legends about the possible origins, alternative names or substitutes of these materials. Resource accumulation is a long-term process and cannot be rushed. We should start with those marginal materials and basic raw materials that are traceable and can be used to confuse the public and establish a stable and inconspicuous supply. Chain.limo set the strategy. At the same time, we should use the communication channels with the coral society and dragon soul to subtly learn about the modern research progress and application fields of certain special minerals or energy materials without revealing our intentions.</p>
<p>Knowledge is sometimes more important than physical objects. In the outside world, the impact of Dragon Souls global undersea potential ancient energy note assessment white paper is unfolding. Although it doesn&#x27;t name names, its description of the southwestern Misty Bay as abnormally in condition, suspected of containing unnatural energy aggregates has undoubtedly attracted more attention, both overt and covert, to that area. Several medium-sized survivor alliances that have intelligence ties with Mo Yuan Pavilion have strengthened their monitoring and intelligence sharing of the southwestern route, clearly taking precautions. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s shift towards basic geological research appears to have yielded some minor results.</p>
<p>through academic channels controlled by Dragon Soul. They published a paper on the correlation between anomalous heavy metal element cycles in late pleaene sediments of a certain sea basin and paleocclimate events. The paper was substantial but made no mention of ancient civilizations attributing all findings to complex paleoic chemical processes. This served as a low-key academic debut showcasing their value while avoiding provoking any undue influence. The southwestern bay itself remains shrouded in dense fog.</p>
<p>However, based on the state transition critical point prediction algorithm provided by the coral society and combined with the latest monitoring data, Emo Yuongo has reassessed the situation and made a more accurate judgment. The dormant state of the structures within the bay has declined to near the theoretical critical awakening threshold and their internal systems may be undergoing a slow but continuous warm-up or selfch check process. The time it takes for them to actively open their eyes or release signals to the outside world next may be significantly shorter than the last time. Just as everyone inside and outside Muan Pavilion was gathering strength for their long-term goals, the Coral Society sent its third contact through a pre-reserved encrypted channel. This time there were no new physical samples, only a very brief request for technical consultation.</p>
<p>They requested that Moyuan using its improved model and environmental monitoring data assess the potential disturbance prediction of the impact on node stability in the surrounding environment when applying a precisely designed low power multiband composite resonant field at specific geographical nodes. Several attitude and longitude coordinates are provided in the appendix, three of which are very close to the southwest Misty Bay. They emphasized that this was merely a theoretical deduction requirement to refine the active intervention simulation module of their model. This request instantly created a tense atmosphere within the core of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. The Coral Society finally stopped concealing their intentions.</p>
<p>They not only wanted to observe the southwest bay, but were also actively planning some form of active contact or technical intervention. And now they hope to use the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s models and observation capabilities to assess the risks of such intervention. They read bolder than we imagined. Sure house said in a deep voice they just had the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood incident and they dare to plan resonance field intervention on something of unknown size in the bay. It has also possible that they have mastered key technologies or security measures that we donty know about.</p>
<p>Leeway analyzed from a technical perspective where they believe that the things in the Gulf have reached a level of dormcancy that makes it safe to try to wake them up or engage with them. Dot Lynn and Mo stared at the list of coordinates and the brief description of the resonant field parameters lost in thought for a long time. Providing such an assessment was tantamount to indirectly participating in the risky actions that the coral society might take. But refusing could sever this valuable channel of technical exchange and deprive him of a window into understanding the other party&#x27;s true capabilities and intentions. An assessment can be conducted.</p>
<p>Lenmo finally decided, but the assessment report must be based on the most conservative risk assumptions highlighting all uncertainties and potential chain reactions. At the same time, a clear technical challenge section should be included in the report, pointing out that there are multiple potential overlaps between its resonant field parameter design and our known dangerous frequencies and citing the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood accident as a cautionary case. Finally, citing limitations of the theoretical model, the assessment results should be stated as being for reference only and not constituting any action recommendations. This is a response that fulfills the obligation of cooperation, clearly defines the boundaries of responsibility, and even carries a warning connotation. Mayuan Pavilion needs to continue walking this dangerous tight trope, acquiring knowledge while avoiding being dragged into an uncontrollable vortex.</p>
<p>The model is being refined, resources are being sought, and the external winds seem to be blowing increasingly fiercely from the southwest. Chapter 126. Warning assessment. The Coral Society&#x27;s brief yet clearly stated technical consultation request was like a hot potato placed before Moingga. The question was how to assess the risks of an active resonant field intervention on the structure of the southwest misty bay and the examiner was likely to be the harsh reality.</p>
<p>Lynmo&#x27;s instructions were clear and resolute. Do it carefully, estimate conservatively and issue explicit warnings. This was not only a response to the coral society, but also a serious test of Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s own technical judgment. In the underground command center, Leewi, Suian, and several core analysts were engaged in intensive simulation work on the upgraded ancient energy equipment function and environmental interaction simulation platform. The resonant field parameters provided by the Coral Society were carefully input.</p>
<p>It was a composite signal sequence containing seven different fundamental frequencies each with three different modulation waveforms with a power level marked as extremely low but the duration of action was planned to last 48 hours. They designed the signal very smartly. Leeway analyzed as he operated the system. Of the seven fundamental frequencies, three fall within our known safe channels that are strongly correlated with the environmental context. to maintain a safe distance from known biologically sensitive frequency bands and two very subtly brush against the edges of those ancient system characteristic frequencies that we have labeled as potentially dangerous or unknown in function.</p>
<p>This is not a brutal stimulus but more like a carefully designed probing knock using mostly safe frequencies as cover and carrier with a little bit of special greeting dot. Such Chian is responsible for monitoring the ecological impact prediction module integrated into the simulation platform. Duration is the biggest variable she points out. Even with extremely low power signals, the cumulative shaping or disruption effect on the local energy environment over 48 hours cannot be ignored. The model shows that around the 18th hour, identifiable distortions begin to appear in the diffusion patterns of specific rare earth elements in the waters surrounding the target area bay.</p>
<p>After the 36th hour, the simulated structure dormcy curve begins to show an accelerated downward trend exceeding the error range. They gradually increase the simulation parameters to test various unexpected scenarios, assuming the construct was far more sensitive to a certain edge frequency than expected. assuming unpredictable distortion or resonant amplification of the signal as it propagated through complex underwater topography and multi-layer media. Assuming a natural global energy background fluctuation occurred during the intervention, resulting in a superp position effect. The results of each stress test were unsettling.</p>
<p>Even in the most optimistic scenario of all parameters precise and no unexpected interference, the simulated construct eventually crossed the critical awakening threshold, entering a simulated lowactivity standby state. Its internal energy field fluctuated more intensely, releasing a series of ambiguous but clearly energy characteristic response pulses. In over 70% of the unexpected scenarios, the results pointed to varying degrees of loss of control. From violent internal energy releases caused by the construct safety mechanisms being mistakenly triggered, similar to but weaker than the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood incident to the release of response pulses triggering a chain reaction of activity in a wider range of deep sea anomalies. And finally to the worst case scenario, the simulation program crashed due to parameter overflow, indicating that the system response exceeded the model prediction boundary.</p>
<p>After 36 consecutive hours of tireless simulation and verification, a comprehensive risk assessment report over 50 pages long and containing numerous charts, data citations, and uncertainty statements entitled theoretical risk assessment report on applying composite resonant fields to specific geographic nodes was finally completed. The report&#x27;s core conclusion highlighted in bold states, &quot;Based on current understanding and technological models, the proposed intervention carries a high risk of triggering unpredictable changes in the target system state and potential regional chain reactions. The risks primarily stem from the target systems current nearcitritical dormcancy level, the potential coupling of specific frequency parameters with unknown dangerous frequency bands, and the cumulative effects of long-term intervention. Implementation in a real world environment is strongly discouraged. The final chapter of the report which Lynn Mo requested to include is titled technical questions and case warnings.</p>
<p>It details the similarities between the resonant field parameters and the dangerous frequencies observed in the window event, the knocking on the door event and the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood accident and includes an energy release spectrum from the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood accident for comparison. The warning message of which is self-evident. The report was sent to the Coral Society via an encrypted channel. Inside the Mo Yuan Pavilion, everyone awaited the other party&#x27;s response. Their feelings a mix of emotions.</p>
<p>They hoped this serious warning would be heated. Yet, they also had a vague feeling that since the other party had made such a request, they probably wouldn&#x27;t easily give up just because of a report. While waiting for response, work continued in other areas. Leeway&#x27;s team made an unexpected but important side discovery in their research on ancient resonator units. After comparing the micro structure of the tuning crystal inside the unit with several environmental reference energy spectrum characteristics mentioned in the coral society model framework, they speculated that this crystal is likely a natural environmental harmonic recorder.</p>
<p>It adjusts its lattice structure extremely slowly over a long period of time to adapt to and memorize the dominant energy frequencies of its environment. This may explain why the component is so sensitive to certain frequencies because it inherently recognizes these frequencies. If this conjecture holds true, Leewayi said excitedly, then by analyzing more ancient crystal samples from different sources, we might be able to read the environmental energy climate of different periods and locations in ancient times, just like reading tree rings. This is more direct than ice core records. Su Chian then began to use the new model to re-examine the environmental data that Mo Yuinga had collected in the early days near the Hemlock Island mine, looking for whether any more subtle energy field fingerprints related to the stone slab had been overlooked.</p>
<p>Chandwa&#x27;s resource network received an exciting yet troublesome piece of information. An independent prospector who had been operating in the waters near the edge of the lava islands in the south claimed to have discovered a black glassy substance in a cooled lava tube within a submarine volcanic fissure. This substance was described as shimmering with a strange internal luster incredibly hard and extremely sensitive to temperature changes. The description closely matched the properties of a mid-grade structural material code named earth vein tempered glass on the sky city materials list. However, the prospector lost contact after sending the message and his last reported location coordinates pointed to a dangerous area known for its active submarine volcanoes and fierce currents.</p>
<p>The source of information is of moderate reliability, but the target&#x27;s characteristics match well and its geographical location is remote, making it unlikely to attract the attention of major powers. Chen Duo Duo assessed it&#x27;s worth sending a capable team to verify it, but the risks are considerable. After careful consideration, Lynn Mo approved the reconnaissance operation, but stipulated that it must be carried out with the highest safety standards. The team&#x27;s mission was limited to confirming the existence of the mineral vein and taking preliminary samples. They were strictly prohibited from engaging in prolonged combat or venturing into dangerous areas.</p>
<p>The operation was cenamed glass probe. Just as the glass probe team was secretly preparing to set off, a reply arrived from the Coral Society. The reply remained brief and calm. They expressed their gratitude and high respect for Moyuan&#x27;s detailed and professional risk assessment and acknowledged that the risks identified in the report do exist and need to be taken seriously. However, the letter also subtly mentioned that their understanding of the target node and Moyuan&#x27;s model based on existing data might have some cognitive differences based on different information sources.</p>
<p>They stated that they would carefully consider the report&#x27;s recommendations and may further optimize and strengthen the intervention plan. At the end of the letter, they made a new seemingly unrelated request, asking if Muan Pavilion was interested in the spatial topology reconstruction of ancient large-scale energy transmission networks and implying that they possessed some fragments of historical distribution maps of the main channels for underwater energy transmission. The Haven T given up. Chi and Duo Duo put down the translated telegram. They just changed their wording.</p>
<p>Cognitive difference. They may have crucial information about the situation inside the Gulf that we donty know making them think the risks are manageable. Optimization plan. They will still try dot. The newly proposed energy network topology research is both a shift in topic and a demonstration of their deeper knowledge reserves.</p>
<p>Continuing to tempt us, Leeway added. Lynamo stared intently at the letter, his gaze deep. The Coral Society was like a seasoned deep sea angler, patiently casting bait and adjusting the line. They wanted to fish in the bay and the data and assessment capabilities of the Moanon Pavilion were a crucial part of their fishing gear. In response, we stated that we have academic interest in the study of energy network topology and can exchange views on the macrolevel issue of the historical evolution of the distribution of main channels and its correlation with geological activities.</p>
<p>However, we will not discuss specific coordinates or detailed maps at this time, Linmo replied. At the same time, we will internally upgrade the confidentiality level and analysis frequency of all monitoring data in the Southwest Bay. We must be prepared to know immediately whatever the Coral Society does next and assess the potential impact on us. The warning has been issued. The choice lies with the other side.</p>
<p>All Mo Yuan Pavilion can do is continue to fortify its observation posts, hone its analytical skills, and strive to discern the intentions of each opponent in this increasingly complex game. Resources await in a distance. Technology breaks through at the forefront and the dark clouds of the storm may be quietly gathering above the seemingly calm fog in the southwest. Their voyage is destined to oscillate between caution and ambition, searching for the most elusive safe passage. Chapter 1 27 glass and undercurrents.</p>
<p>Operation Glass Probe, a reconnaissance mission unfolded quietly under extreme secrecy and meticulous preparation. The team consisted of four experienced members. The captain was Chun Hai who had distinguished himself in the shadow of the storm mission. The team members included Lau, a technician skilled in geological and mineral identification, a Shouer, a helmsman adept at navigating dangerous waters, and Shia Mo, an electronics expert responsible for communications and equipment support. They boarded a specially modified unassuming but high-performance high-speed boat and quietly departed from the anchorage outside Mo Yuan Pavilion in the darkest hour before dawn heading south towards a notoriously turbulent lava islands waters.</p>
<p>According to intelligence, the target area is located on the eastern edge of the archipelago near an active submarine volcanic fisher zone known as black smokers. The seabed there is complex with hydrothermal vents constantly spewing high temperature, high pressure acidic water and toxic gases. While the surface is perpetually turbulent with dangerous and irregular eddies and upwellings due to the confluence of warm and cold water. The small boat must traverse this natural barrier discreetly to find the coordinates last reported by the missing explorer on the main island of Mayuan Pavilion. Linmo and the others had to temporarily shift their focus away from the glassy probe because the ripples from the Coral Society&#x27;s subsequent actions after receiving the warning assessment report were beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>First, there&#x27;s a technical briefing leaked through a semi-public academic exchange platform of the Coral Society attributed to an independent research team. The briefing is titled a new exploration of numerical simulation of the influence of specific low-frequency composite resonant fields on stable energy background environments. While the briefing&#x27;s content is technically complex, its core argument subtly dialogues with a warning assessment report from Moyuan. The independent team claims that simulations using their improved multifysics coupling model have confirmed that under strict parameter control and multiple safety redundancy mechanisms, the influence of specific low-frequency resonant fields on quasi steadystate energy structures is highly directional and reversible and the probability of triggering a systematic chain reaction of runaway reactions is below the model error threshold. Although the briefing doesn&#x27;t mention any specific locations or projects, it&#x27;s clear to anyone with a discerning eye that this is providing theoretical support for the safety and feasibility of some kind of active intervention technology.</p>
<p>They are responding to our warnings through academic discussions and tried to establish a new technological discourse. Leeway analyzed the briefing. We didn&#x27;t TC the details of their proposed improve model and safety redundancy mechanism, but if it as true, it means that their ability to control risks may be stronger than we thought. Chind Woodwa&#x27;s intelligence network also detected related movements. Several vessels flying the flags of neutral research institutions, but with hull types and equipment configurations clearly exceeding the requirements of routine scientific research appeared on the high seas outside the southwestern Foggy Bay.</p>
<p>They did not approach the dense fog area of the bay, but instead remained anchored at several points about 100 nautical miles away, conducting continuous hydraological, meteorological, and deep sea acoustic monitoring. The resupply and personnel rotation of these vessels had indirect but traceable connections to several peripheral cover organizations known to the coral society. They are establishing forward observation posts and benchmark monitoring points. Chi and Duo Duo judged to collect real-time background data for possible interventions and to monitor any disturbances in the Gulf. This scale of preparation does not seem like a spur-ofthe- moment thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dragon Soul seemed to have noticed the unusual increase in attention in the southwest. One of their routine patrol fleets coincidentally adjusted its course, beginning to more frequently cross the edge of the waters where the Coral Society monitoring ship was located and incidentally conducted several public search and rescue and antipiriracy drills. The exercise areas intentionally or unintentionally covering several key waterways leading to the bay. This was a silent but highly deterrent declaration. Dragon Soul is watching this area.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation where multiple eyes are focused on the southwest, the monitoring of the bay within the Moyuan pavilion has been raised to an unprecedented level. All relevant data streams have been given the highest processing priority and the environmental model is assimilated and fine-tuned in terms of trends almost every 2 hours. The model continues to show that the dormcancy curve of the base structure after a brief plateau period has once again begun an extremely slow but certain decline which is infinitely close to the theoretical critical awakening threshold. It&#x27;s like a spring that&#x27;s been constantly heated. Although it hasn&#x27;t snapped open yet, the energy it&#x27;s accumulating is almost at its limit, Sue Chanchian said with concern.</p>
<p>Amidst this tense monitoring atmosphere, the glass probe team transmitted its first and only interim report. The communication signal was encrypted and compressed multiple times and its content was brief but crucial. Approaching the target&#x27;s perimeter, strong hydrothermal interference and complex magnetic field detected. Sonar detection indicates the existence of the target lava tube structure, but the entrance appears to have been partially buried by recent geological activity. An attempt at external scanning detected a strong energy reflection signal with characteristics highly similar to the described glassy material.</p>
<p>The environment is extremely harsh, making underwater operations impossible. Requesting the use of the shutter for close-range optical reconnaissance and surface sampling. Chining is a super small unmanned underwater vehicle secretly developed by Moyu. It has a certain degree of autonomous navigation and operation capabilities. Its shape imitates deep sea creatures and has excellent silent performance, but it is extremely precious and has limited risk resistance.</p>
<p>Lynmo, Sure, How and Shin Duo Duo held an emergency meeting. The confirmation of the target substance&#x27;s existence was good news, but the environment was harsh and a latent material was precious. More importantly, what happened to the missing prospector? Did he die in the harsh natural environment or approval for the use of hidden shadow is granted, but the strictest operational boundaries and safety self-destruct protocols are set. Lynn Mo finally gave the order. The mission objective is limited to obtaining the minimum amount of surface samples such as scattered debris and highresolution images.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances are you allowed to enter unstable structures or resist strong interference. If any abnormal signs of life are found, or if you encounter incomprehensible energy or mechanical activity, immediately abandon the mission and retrieve or self-destruct the hidden shadow. The command was sent via a remote encrypted link. Hours later, highly compressed, intermittent video data and a few faint sensor readings returned to Mo Yuan Pavilion. The video footage was violently shaky, filled with numerous bubbles and suspended particles.</p>
<p>But under the beam of the search light, a thick twisted band of black glassy material could be vaguely seen, winding like a giant python along the seabed lava wall. Its surface did indeed shimmer with a strange, seemingly internal iridescent sheen. The shadow&#x27;s robotic arm carefully collected several small fragments that had broken off from the main vein. Just as sampling was completed and the scuba diving device began to surface, the sensors recorded a brief low-frequency vibration of unknown direction accompanied by severe snow-like interference in a video feed. A few seconds later, the interference disappeared and the scuba diving device was successfully recovered to the small boat.</p>
<p>The team reported that the vibration did not cause any significant geological changes, but as a precaution, they immediately withdrew from the area as planned and were on their way back. The glass sample is about to be obtained, a real small step forward for the Sky City project. But the mystery of the explorer&#x27;s disappearance, the brief, abnormal tremor, and the increasingly heavy air over the southwest bay are like new veils shrouding the seemingly smooth progress. the Coral Society&#x27;s theoretical groundwork and on the ground preparations, the Dragon Souls deterrent patrols, the approaching critical point of the bay&#x27;s structural features, and the numerous clues and movements from the recently completed daring sampling expedition in the far south. All these, like the turbulent currents beneath the deep sea intertwined on the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s monitoring screens, forming an increasingly complex situational map.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo knew that the luster of the glass might pave the way for the future. But what needed most vigilance at the moment was the door in the dense fog to the southwest. A door whose consequences were unknown and could be knocked at any moment by accident or human intervention. Resources and technology were important. But ensuring the stability of their observation posts and the sharpness of their observation capabilities before the storm truly arrived was the first priority for survival.</p>
<p>The Mo Yuan Pavilion ships had to maintain their composure and see the navigational markers clearly amidst these currents, whether visible or hidden. Chapter 128. Sample marks. Under the cover of night, the glass probe team quietly returned, bringing back several pieces of black glassy debris contained in a speciallymade lead alloy containment box, as well as the short distorted underwater video. The small boat itself also bore the marks of environmental devastation.</p>
<p>new scratches and slight corrosion spots on the hole, silently testifying to the treacherous nature of that sea. The sample was immediately sent to the ultra clean isolation room of the underground laboratory. As the accompanying geological expert, Lao Go, without taking a break, immediately joined Leewi&#x27;s team in the preliminary analysis of the sample. Under strong light, the sample appeared as a deep black, but when held up to a light source at a specific angle. Its interior indeed refracted a colorful flowing halo like an oil film, beautiful and eerie.</p>
<p>It has extremely high density and a hardness exceeding that of top grade alloy steel, but it is also very brittle. Wearing thick gloves, Lu carefully tested it with a diamond stylus. It has an abnormally low thermal conductivity, even lower than the best insulation materials. Its sensitivity to temperature changes is indeed extremely high. Just by shining a handheld laser pointer on a local area for a few seconds, visible micro cracks and slight shape memory rebound appeared on the sample surface.</p>
<p>More sophisticated instrumental analysis revealed even more mysteries. X-ray defraction showed a predominantly amorphous structure interspersed with unidentifiable extremely regularly arranged nanocale crystal domains. Mass spectrometry detected a variety of rare elements including several isotopes that should theoretically not be enriched in natural volcanic environments. Energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed extremely trace amounts of a specific rare earth element identical to that found in debris from deep sea anomalies uniformly distributed within the sample. This is definitely not naturally formed volcanic glass that Lewi looked at the preliminary report and said with certainty it was manufactured and the manufacturing process involve high temperature and high pressure environments and complex material ratios that we cannot understand.</p>
<p>Those regular crystal domains and special isotopes are evidence of this. It may be the earth vein tempered glass mentioned on the list. A kind of artificially synthesized building material with special energy and physical properties. Such an became interested in the shape memory properties exhibited by the sample when subjected to energy stimulation laser radiation. This is not just thermal expansion and contraction but more like a weak energy elasticity.</p>
<p>It may be designed to absorb or buffer specific types of energy impacts and then slowly return to its original shape. If Sky City uses this material extensively, its overall structure may possess environmental adaptability and damage resistance that we cannot imagine. The analysis of the sample was encouraging, confirming the authenticity of the materials list and the superiority of the Sky City technology. However, the underwater video after repeated noise reduction and enhancement also revealed some previously overlooked details. During the sample collection by the hidden shadow sensor in the background of the video, deep within the vast winding black glass vein, there appeared to be extremely faint, regular flashes of light intermittently spaced for about 2 or 3 seconds, lasting for approximately half a minute before disappearing.</p>
<p>The light spots were dark red, distinctly different from the surrounding ambient light. Shortly afterward, a brief low-frequency vibration was recorded by the sensor. Are these spots of light biological or the fluoresence of some kind of mineral? Or as an electronics expert, Shia Mo proposed a bolder conjecture? Could they be some kind of lighting or indicator device still operating at low power inside or behind that mineral vein? This conjecture caused the atmosphere in the laboratory to freeze instantly. If that vein was not merely an unclaimed material deposit, but rather a component of some ancient facility, or even if some kind of activity existed within it, then could the glass probe teams close sampling have already alerted something? Lenmo listened to the full report. The confirmation of the sample was a major breakthrough, giving a strong boost to the Sky City project.</p>
<p>However, the question of the underwater glowing spots was a potential risk signal. Sample studies continue, but all energy stimulation experiments must be suspended until we fully understand its energy elasticity mechanism, Lynn Mo instructed. At the same time, input the data on the light spot phenomenon and low frequency vibrations into our ancient energy equipment and environmental interaction simulation platform and try to compare them with any known ancient creation behavior patterns. In addition, Chin Duo Duo use all intelligence networks to investigate whether there are any other abnormal reports in the history of the lava islands waters, especially regarding seabed luminescence or unexplained vibration stuff. Just as Muan Pavilion was busy digesting the results of the glassy probe, the situation in the southwest suddenly heated up due to the actions of the Coral Society.</p>
<p>The Coral Society&#x27;s research vessels deployed around the bay suddenly began highintensity continuous broadband sonar scanning. The scanning beams were no longer merely monitoring the environmental background, but clearly exhibited an active exploration nature focusing on the fogcovered core area of the bay. Simultaneously, through several publicly available marine scientific research collaboration platforms, they issued a joint environmental survey notice claiming that in order to deeply study the modulation effects of global energy background disturbances on local climate and ocean circulation, they would conduct a multi-ship synchronous high power active acoustic detection experiment in a specific sea area coordinates covering part of the bay&#x27;s outer perimeter within the next 72 hours and sincerely invited relevant research institutions to share the data. The announcement was academically worded procedurally compliant and even included a prior environmental impact assessment with a conclusion that the impact is negligible. However, to those in the no, this was tantamount to a declaration of war.</p>
<p>The Coral Society was using this to legitimize its intervention in the Gulf, giving it the guise of legitimate and public scientific research. Dragon Soul reacted immediately. their patrol fleet, citing ensuring the safety of international scientific research activities and preventing miscalculations approached the Coral Society ships further and publicly demanded that the Coral Society provide more detailed experimental plans and safety protocols. Dragon Souls official news agency published a commentary emphasizing that any scientific research activity that may affect regional security and stability should adhere to the principles of openness, transparency, and responsibility and should be subject to full consultation with stakeholders, implicitly suggesting that the Coral Society&#x27;s actions were unilateral and potentially risky. Other factions mostly remained silent and observed, but their private intelligence exchanges and ship movements noticeably intensified.</p>
<p>Everyone since the approaching storm, the Coral Society seemed determined to unveil a corner of the mystery surrounding the Southwest Bay. While the dragon soul was determined to control the process or at least prevent it from spiraling out of control, the monitoring network at Muan Pavilion is operating at full speed, recording any subtle changes in the energy field, biological behavior, and even atmospheric parameters around the bay. The model shows that within hours of the coral society beginning its highintensity scan, the dormcy curve of the bay&#x27;s structure experienced identifiable acceleration in its downward trend. External active stimulation is accelerating its awakening process. Such Chanchian stared at the real-time updated curve.</p>
<p>Even if the Coral Society san itself does not contain the resonance field they planned, this continuous highintensity energy disturbance is like constantly knocking on the door of a light sleeper. Leeway focused more on the details of the scanning signal. Their scanning signal was specially modulated, embedding an extremely complex encrypted data stream. This is not just probing. It&#x27;s shouting.</p>
<p>Shouting in a way that only a specific target can understand. They must have mastered the code. We don&#x27;t know about how to communicate with that construct. The situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The Coral Society acted more aggressively and swiftly than anticipated.</p>
<p>They seemed to believe the time was ripe. Or perhaps they had received some inside information that compelled them to act quickly. Linmo stood before the massive situation map in the command center, his gaze grave. On the map, the red cone-shaped area representing the Coral Society&#x27;s scanning beam like several sharp swords peers towards the gray area representing the dense fog of the bay. The dragon souls blue fleet insignia hovered around it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the curve representing the dormcancy level of the bay structures flashed a warning orange red slowly but firmly sliding towards the red marked critical awakening area. Activate the silent abyss contingency plan. Linmo ordered in a deep voice. All non-core personnel move to designated shelters. Main island and all surrounding monitoring points enter full band passive recording mode and shut down all unnecessary energy radiation.</p>
<p>Sure. How the guard team go to maximum alert and prepare to deal with any possible energy shocks or secondary disasters. Shin Duo Duo maintain the intelligence network at maximum sensitivity. I need to know any of the latest developments of the Coral Society Dragon Soul and the interior of the bay report every minute. The Silent Abyss contingency plan is the highest level passive defense and observation plan formulated by the Mo Yuan Pavilion to cope with possible large-scale unknown energy disasters or conflicts.</p>
<p>It means that the Mo Yuan Pavilion will act like a true deep sea reef, concealing all its presence and retaining only the most basic abilities of listening and seeing silently recording everything that is about to happen. The order was quickly relayed and the entire Miuan Pavilion Island seemed to enter hibernation. The lights went out, the noise stopped, and only the indicator lights of various monitoring devices deep underground continued to flash silently in the darkness. The joy brought by the sample had barely faded when it was overshadowed by the imminent crisis. The glass, though beautiful, pald in comparison to the distant thunder.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo knew that the next 72 hours would likely determine the power dynamics and security of the Southwest Bay and indeed this entire region for a long time come. The Mo Yuan Pavilion was powerless to stop it, nor could it intervene. All they could do was firmly root themselves at the edge of this storm&#x27;s eye, keeping their eyes wide open, recording this dangerous dialogue that was about to unfold between human curiosity and ambition and the ancient slumber. The fog remained thick, but the silhouettes within it seemed to have begun to tremble slightly. The scanning sound waves were like knocking on a door.</p>
<p>One after another, would the being behind the door respond with a whisper or with a roar that would devour the knockers and everything around them? The answer was about to be revealed. Chapter 1 29 Echoes of the Sea of Mist. In its quiet abyss state, Mo Yuan Pavilion resembled a heart sunk into the deep sea. Its pulse slowed to a minimum. Yet, its sensory tendrils extended with unprecedented sensitivity towards the southwest.</p>
<p>All energy output was suppressed to a level sufficient only to sustain life and basic monitoring. All lights on the island surface were extinguished, and even the smoke from daily cooking fires was condensed and recycled. Only within the underground command center, on the screens connected to arrays of passive sensors scattered across the vast sea, did data flow like a silent waterfall pouring forth without a sound. The specially modulated broadband scanning beams emitted by the Coral Society&#x27;s research vessels, like a continuous knocking sound repeatedly washed over the outer barrier of the southwestern Misty Bay for the first dozen or so hours. Apart from a slight increase in the already faint background noise around the bay, no other obvious anomalies were detected.</p>
<p>The dense fog remained, like an unchanging gray wall, silently standing between the sea and the sky. However, around the 20th hour of the scan, changes began to appear in an extremely subtle but unmistakable manner. First, an infrasound receiving array pointing towards the bay recorded an extremely low and regular single frequency pulse lasting about 3 minutes. The pulse intensity was very low, almost drowned out by the background ocean noise, but its frequency stability and waveform purity were unlike any known natural sound source such as whale songs, earthquakes, or ocean current friction. It sounds like an extremely slow and steady heartbeat.</p>
<p>Such an Xian wearing noiseancelling headphones carefully discerned the algorithm enhanced audio signal. It&#x27;s coming from the central area of the bay. This has never been recorded before. Almost simultaneously, magnetometers positioned at a greater distance to monitor minute disturbances in the geomagnetic field detected a regular periodic deflection of the magnetic field vector in the direction of the bay. The deflection amplitude was extremely small and the period was perfectly synchronized with the heartbeat like sound pulse.</p>
<p>There is coordinated activity within the energy field. That leeway stared at the synchronously displayed acoustic and magnetic field datagramraphs. His voice deep. It is not a passive response but more like some kind of internal selfch check or state synchronization process has been activated under the scanning stimulus. That construct is indeed listening and has begun to adjust some of its own basic rhythms.</p>
<p>These changes, though subtle, were like the first ripples on a calm surface, foreshadowing unseen shifts occurring beneath the surface. The Mo Yuan Pavilion model immediately incorporated these new parameters into its calculations. After a brief plateau, the evaluation curve for the construct&#x27;s dormcancy level showed an even steeper downward trend. Its value now almost touching the red marked critical awakening threshold. The Coral Society&#x27;s vessels also appeared to detect these changes.</p>
<p>Their scanning signals underwent a brief adjustment, shifting from continuous full band coverage to a more focused combination of specific frequencies and incorporating more complex intermittent transmission patterns resembling interrogation weight interrogation. This seemed more like a tentative attempt at dialogue. The Dragon Souls patrol fleet further reduced the safe distance between itself and the Coral Society ships and began releasing broadband jamming signals to interfere with and suppress communications. Although nominally to prevent experimental signals from interfering with civilian navigation, their actual intention was self-evident. They were trying to interrupt or interfere with any communication that the Coral Society might establish with the Gulf.</p>
<p>The three parties engaged in a silent and complex game of wits using energy waves as their weapon in the skies above the sea area. Time amidst intense monitoring reached the 40th hour since the scan began. The changes intensified suddenly. The heartbeat like acoustic pulses emanating from the bay began to increase in frequency and extremely slow rate while their intensity also subtly but steadily increased. Simultaneously, the amplitude of the magnetic field disturbances expanded.</p>
<p>Even more disturbingly, several deep sea temperature monitoring buoys deployed by Moyuan Pavilion in the surrounding waters recorded signs of large-scale abnormal mixing of hot and cold water at the bottom of the bay, causing a brief and anomalous temperature gradient reversal in a localized area. Then 45 hours after the scam began, the thick, almost tangible fog that had shrouded the bay for months showed its first visible large-scale disturbance. Unlike last time when it dispersed and dissipated from the center, the entire wall of fog seemed to be stirred from within by an invisible giant hand, violently churning and surging, forming countless enormous, slowly rotating vortices. The density of the fog itself also seemed to fluctuate, sometimes thinning to vaguely reveal a corner of the massive, menacing outline of the building behind it, and sometimes thickening again, swallowing everything up once more. The entire bay seemed to be filled with the restless tossing and turning of a sleeping behemoth.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been disturbed and can&#x27;t sleep peacefully. Shouse stared at the real-time images transmitted back by the high alitude reconnaissance balloon, his voice grave. The Coral Society ships seemed to take this as a positive signal, further increasing the power and complexity of the scanning signals and even began attempting to transmit a sequence of guiding signals that had a specific harmonic relationship with that heartbeat frequency. The Dragon Soul Fleet immediately issued a stern radio warning, demanding that the Coral Academy immediately cease any unconventional experiments that could lead to uncontrollable environmental risks and began emitting powerful sonic pulses toward the bay in an attempt to counteract the interference. At this critical moment when multiple forces were intertwined and the situation was on the verge of exploding, the core area of the Gulf finally made its first clear proactive response that went beyond the scope of whispers.</p>
<p>All monitoring equipment, whether from a UN pavilion, Coral Society, or Dragon Soul, simultaneously detected an incredibly intense wide bandwidth energy pulse burst. The pulse didn&#x27;t originate from a single point, but rather seemed to erupt simultaneously from all parts of the massive structure deep within the bay. Its energy spectrum covered electromagnetic waves ranging from infrasound to extremely high frequencies, instantly overwhelming all active scanning and interference signals. Accompanying the pulse was a dark red fan-shaped light curtain, clearly visible even in daylight, which burst upwards from the depths of the dense fog, piercing through the churning sea of mist and soaring into the sky, lasting for about 3 seconds before slowly dimming and dissipating. After the pulse, there was a brief, suffocating silence.</p>
<p>All instrument readings fluctuated wildly before settling into an eerie, below baseline calm. The churning fog seemed to freeze instantly, ceasing its movement. A few seconds later, a new change occurred. The heartbeat-like sonic pulse disappeared. In its place came a deep, continuous, and teeth grinding compound roar as if countless metal gears and pipes were slowly turning, rubbing, and releasing stress under immense pressure.</p>
<p>This sound was not sharp, but it carried a heavy weight, penetrating the seawater and air and spreading for hundreds of nautical miles. At the same time, the dense fog began to contract and sink inward at a steady pace as if drawn downward by an invisible force. Visibility in the central area of the bay rapidly improved, and the massive complex metal fortress, riddled with pipes and auxiliary structures, was exposed to sunlight with unprecedented clarity. The surface of its towering cylindrical structure at its center, which had previously been dull, now flowed with a dark red lavalike luster, and many of its auxiliary structures began to expand, contract, and rotate rhythmically, spewing out bursts of white high temperature steam. It at least its external systems and energy core has been fully awakened.</p>
<p>The target has crossed the critical awakening threshold and entered a low activity state. The intensity of the external energy field has increased sharply and the physical structure shows obvious signs of activity. The leeway&#x27;s voice was dry as he quickly reported the observation conclusion. Its energy release mode is actively scanning the surrounding environment. The scanning method includes a variety of modulation signals that we cannot analyze which are suspected to be identifying and evaluating that.</p>
<p>The Coral Society&#x27;s ships experienced a brief communication disruption and equipment malfunction under the initial pulse impact. They&#x27;re now urgently adjusting their attitude, seemingly both shocked and excited as their scanning equipment begins to record and analyze the signals actively released by the construct. The Dragon Soul fleet was on high alert with all ships entering maximum combat readiness, weapon systems unlocked, and more jamming and suppression signals fired toward the bay. At the same time, it issued an ultimatum to the Coral Society, demanding that it immediately evacuate the danger zone. The silent abyss contingency plan of the Mo Yuan Pavilion, now proved its value.</p>
<p>Their extremely low energy signature made them blend into the background noise, failing to trigger the initial targeted scan by the awakening constructs. They were able to continue quietly and comprehensively recording everything. Energy parameters, physical changes, and reactions from all sides. Lynn and Mo stood in the command center, watching the chillingly clear metallic colossus on the screen and a tense atmosphere in the surrounding seas. The warning had become a reality.</p>
<p>The door had been knocked open, and the being behind it had opened its eyes, beginning to scrutinize this world that had rashly disturbed it. The fog has dissipated, leaving behind a deafening echo. But this is only the beginning. What follows dialogue, conflict, or destruction? No one knows. The only certainty for the Mo Yuan Pavilion is that they must stand firm like the most resilient reefs on the edge of this unprecedented vortex of energy storms and clashing wills, discerning the trajectory of every wave.</p>
<p>For this awakening, ignited by the Coral Society and attempted to be controlled by the dragon soul, will inevitably spread its ripples throughout the entire sea. No one can truly remain uninvolved. Their observations have never been so crucial nor so perilous. Chapter 130, the Eye of Awakening. As the thick fog dissipated, sunlight for the first time poured unhindered down upon the colossal metal structure known as the fortress, illuminating every angle, every weld, and every massive pipe with crystal clarity, almost blindingly so.</p>
<p>It was no longer a blurred outline slumbering behind a gray veil, but a naked imposing behemoth radiating intense heat and a dark red glow brimming with aggressive industrial aesthetics. The molten lava-like sheen of the central cylindrical structure swirled slowly as if hot blood were coursing through its metallic veins. The rhythmic expansion, contraction, and rotation of its numerous auxiliary structures emitted a deep, powerful mechanical hum, merging into a symphony of steel that unsettled the soul. The underground command center of Muan Pavilion was now like a highly focused surgical observation room. All the screens were divided into dozens of sections, each displaying real-time data of the awakened construct, captured from different angles and through different monitoring methods.</p>
<p>The energy spectrum waterfall chart churned violently. The magnetic field vector lines twisted into complex vortices and the acoustic waveform records were covered with unprecedented spikes and harmonics. The energy output is stable at a level equivalent to three large tidal power plants operating at full capacity, and it is still slowly climbing. Leeway&#x27;s voice was very low, as if afraid of disturbing the frantically swirling data on the screen. The modulation complexity of its active scanning signal exceeds the upper limit of our existing analytical algorithms containing a large number of discontinuous and nonlinear coded segments.</p>
<p>This is not a chaotic release, but a highly structured information broadcast, only it uses a language and grammar that we don&#x27;t understand at all. Such an stared intently at the biological and environmental monitoring data. The biological response in the surrounding waters is intense. All fish, including deep sea species, are frantically fleeing outwards from the fortress, forming several clear, radial biological vacuum zones. Several nearby monitoring points have recorded large-scale deaths of plankton and the dissolved oxygen content and pH value in the water are fluctuating rapidly.</p>
<p>The energy field it emits and the possible radiation are catastrophic for the ecosystem. Sure, however, focused on the physical threats. The range of movement of its auxiliary structures is expanding. 12 large robotic arm-like structures have been unlocked from their fixed bases and are beginning slow multiaxis interlocking tests. Continuous low-frequency vibrations have been detected at the bottom of the fortress, suggesting that a large propulsion or anchoring system is warming up.</p>
<p>This thing doesn&#x27;t seem like a fixed fortress. It&#x27;s more like some kind of mobile. War platform picked up the conversation, adding the intelligence part in a serious tone. Dragon Soles reconnaissance planes wrist getting close to take pictures and discovered that several structures on the outer perimeter of the fortress which were originally thought to be defensive turrets had their armor plates sliding off to reveal launch ports with peculiar shapes and complex energy focusing devices underneath. More importantly, they discovered deformed iconic patterns and codes commonly used by the remnants of the wings of freedom in some relatively new welding and painting areas.</p>
<p>Wings of Liberty. This name, almost temporarily forgotten, now pierced through the chaotic data like a cold steel needle. The thing in a misty bay of the Southwest was not simply an ancient relic or an unknown creation activated by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s technology. Fundamentally, it was something the remnants of Wings of Liberty had built, or rather modified and assembled over the past few months, using blueprints and technology provided by the Stonemasons Brotherhood. That massive cylindrical structure that construct that triggered the window resonance and the subsequent series of energy disturbances was likely always controlled by Caesar&#x27;s remnants.</p>
<p>They re not hiding inside licking their wounds. Line said slowly, his gaze sharp. They reforging a blade using ancient techniques and blueprints combined with the resources they plundered. They re creating a blade that will allow them to once again shake this world. The previous pulse roar was a test, a calibration.</p>
<p>This awakening is the blade being sharpened. Dot. This realization dramatically escalated the severity of the situation. Facing an unclaimed ancient system that might react according to a fixed program is entirely different from facing a super weapon controlled by human force with clear malice and a desire for revenge. On the screen, the dots representing the Coral Society&#x27;s ships cautiously approach the awakening fortress in a fan shape, continuously emitting complex signals, attempting to establish communication.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t seem deterred by the wings of Liberty&#x27;s intervention. Instead, they seemed even more excited, as if they had found a more direct subject of study. The Dragon Soul Fleet response was far more forceful. Upon confirming the wings of Liberty Insignia, the fleet swiftly shifted from alert and deterrence to attack readiness. More carrier-based aircraft took to the skies.</p>
<p>Anti-hship missile launchers went into battle, and powerful electronic warfare capabilities were unleashed, attempting to disrupt and suppress any offensive commands the fortress might receive from Coral Society vessels or the Dragon Soul Fleet itself. The public channel echoed the Dragon Soul Commander stern ultimatum. Remnants of Wings of Liberty, immediately cease all hostilities. Shut down your energy systems. Disarm and submit to inspection.</p>
<p>Repeat. Immediately cease all operations. However, the fortress made no move whatsoever to understand or respond to the Coral Society&#x27;s signals or the Dragon Souls ultimatum. It simply continued its own system self checks, environmental scans, and energy output ramp up. The extended mechanical arms began purposefully touching and stroking the seawater and reefs around the fortress, even gently grabbing some large marine creatures that couldn&#x27;t escape in time, seemingly collecting samples or testing tactile feedback.</p>
<p>&quot;It is getting to know this world,&quot; Su Chanchian said softly, watching the movements of the robotic arms in its own way. The people of Wings of Freedom may have started it or even set its goals to some extent, but its consciousness, if it has any, is probably much older and more alien than its builders. That what it is currently prioritizing is understanding its own state and its environment. Just then, the part at the top of the central cylindrical structure of the fortress that had briefly flashed white light earlier lit up again. This time it wasn&#x27;t a flash, but a slowly opening eye over 10 meters in diameter, composed of countless hexagonal lises.</p>
<p>This eye had no pupil. Its interior flowed with everchanging dark gold and dark red data light. It slowly rotated, sweeping across the dragon soul fighters in the sky, across the Coral Society ships on the sea, across the distant horizon. And finally, for what seemed like an extremely brief moment, the aftershocks of its scanning beam swept across the location of one of the Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s furthest passive monitoring buoys. Although there was no evidence that it saw or identified the main island of Muan Pavilion, which was in a state of quiet abyss, this glimpse was enough to cause the temperature inside the command center to drop several degrees.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, the eye locked onto the nearest Coral Society research vessel, which was continuously transmitting communication signals. An extremely thin, almost invisible dark red beam of light shot out from the center of the eye, instantly striking the ship&#x27;s communication antenna ray. There was no explosion, no flash, but all the indicator lights on the ship&#x27;s external electronic devices simultaneously went out, and the ship suddenly came to a standstill, as if it had lost all power. and began to drift aimlessly on the sea. A high energy directional electromagnetic pulse or worse some kind of energy neutralization attack that we cannot define that leeway quickly analyze the monitoring data.</p>
<p>It only destroyed the electronic systems and did not damage the ship as structure. Precise and restrained, but definitely a warning dot. Seeing this, the other coral society vessels hurriedly retreated and ceased all active signal transmissions. The Dragon Soul Fleet immediately opened fire as a warning and several Chaff missiles exploded in the airspace between the Fortress and the fleet, creating a thick smoke screen. The eye turned towards the smoke screen, stared at it for a few seconds, seemingly performing spectral and penetration analysis, and then slowly closed.</p>
<p>The molten sheen on the surface of the cylindrical structure also dimmed slightly, and the energy output reading stopped climbing, stabilizing at a level that was still high, but no longer increasing. It identified the aggressive signals, the Coral Society&#x27;s ongoing communication attempts, and decontaminated them. It identified the deterrent actions, Dragon Souls jamming missiles, and chose to observe and assess them. Lynn Mo summarized the logic revealed in this brief confrontation. Its code of conduct is a mixture of the hostile targets that Wings of Liberty may have preset as well as the ancient rules of threat assessment and energy efficiency in its own underlying system.</p>
<p>It is dangerous but not insane. After a brief eye opening and a warning attack, the Awakened Fortress seemed to enter a state of standby alert. It still stood conspicuously in the sunlight, its mechanical arms slowly retracting, its energy field remaining high. Although its eye was closed, no one doubted it could reopen at any moment. The remnants of the Wings of Liberty remained hidden within the fortress like parasites lurking inside a behemoth.</p>
<p>Having learned its lesson, Coral temporarily ceased its attacks. The Dragon Soul Fleet, meanwhile, reached a brief stalemate with the awakened steel behemoth, neither daring to fire the first shot and trigger a full-scale conflict. Meanwhile, within the quiet abyss, the Mo Yuan Pavilion recorded the first action. The first gaze and the first warning following this historic awakening. They knew the balance had been utterly shattered.</p>
<p>A dangerous blade driven by both ancient wisdom and human malice hung over this sea. Every second to come could be the starting point of a storm. Their observations had to be more meticulous and calmer than ever before. For any misjudgment could lead to annihilation in this new and more complex game. The eye of awakening had opened.</p>
<p>What future did it foresee? conquest, destruction, or something else. No one knew, but everyone had to begin learning how to survive under its gaze. Chapter 131 calculations by all parties. The precise yet restrained warning attack from eye of awakening was like a bucket of ice water, extinguishing the initial excitement of the Coral Academy and temporarily freezing the Dragon Soul fleet impending firing. Above the southwestern sea, a tense and eerie stalemate replaced the initial chaos.</p>
<p>Sunlight shone on the silent yet imposing metal fortress. But the sea breeze brought no warmth. In the underground command center of Mayuan Pavilion, the quiet abyss status continues. But the internal data analysis and intelligence assessment work has entered a fever pitch. The massive amounts of data transmitted back by all monitoring equipment are like scattered puzzle pieces which are being rapidly classified, compared, and pieced together.</p>
<p>Leeway&#x27;s team&#x27;s primary task was to analyze the energy characteristics of the dark red beam released during the fortress&#x27;s eye opening attack. It&#x27;s neither a laser nor a particle beam. Leeway pointed to the spectrum analysis chart. The energy is highly concentrated, but the frequency band is extremely unique. The main energy is concentrated in the transition region between far infrared and extremely highfrequency microwaves and it has strong unnatural polarization modulation.</p>
<p>It instantly destroyed the ship&#x27;s electronic system, but the whole structure and even the exposed wooden deck remained unscathed. This selective destruction requires an extremely precise understanding of the target electronic systems resonant frequency and structural weaknesses. Or perhaps its energy itself possesses some kind of information destruction, attribute capable of specifically inducing logical chaos and overload in electronic components. Such an assessing the immediate and potential impacts of this brief awakening on the surrounding ecosystem. The biological vacuum was expanding and large numbers of marine carcasses began to float to the surface, slowly drifting away with the ocean currents.</p>
<p>More alarmingly, a small coral reef monitoring point about 50 nautical miles from the fortress was recording an abnormal but sustained increase in background radiation levels. While the increase was not yet life-threatening, the trend was unsettling. It&#x27;s like a source continuously emitting lowdose radiation and energy pollution with long-term effects that are difficult to estimate. Moreover, its energy field seems capable of interfering with and even reshaping the local micro energy environment, potentially leading to secondary disasters such as abnormal climate and turbulent ocean currents. From a military perspective, Sure.</p>
<p>How combining highaltitude imagery and energy scanning data attempted to outline the fortress&#x27;s offensive and defensive capabilities. Based on their shape and focusing devices, the exposed launch ports are speculated to be used to launch high energy particle streams, hypersonic kinetic energy projectiles, or some kind of energy projection weapon unknown to us. The reflectivity and energy absorption characteristics of its external armor are very unusual, potentially providing excellent stealth or misleading effects against conventional radar and infrared detection. Most importantly, it possesses mobility that the bottom vibration and partially deformable structure suggest it likely has amphibious or even short-range flight capabilities. This is not a stationary target.</p>
<p>Chind Wood&#x27;s intelligence network is operating at full capacity, capturing the initial reactions of all parties after the shock. The Dragon Soul leadership has clearly held an emergency meeting, shifting its frontline fleet posture from attack preparedness to strict blockade and sustained pressure. More long range reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned submarines have been deployed to the surrounding waters to establish a comprehensive surveillance network. Simultaneously, Dragon Soul has issued a notification through diplomatic channels to all known powers, characterizing the Awakening Fortress controlled by the remnants of the Wings of Freedom as an illegal war machine that seriously threatens regional security and stability and calling on the international community to take necessary measures to contain or eliminate it. After losing a research vessel, which had partially regained basic power when towed away, but all its sophisticated equipment was destroyed, the Coral Society&#x27;s remaining ships retreated to a greater distance, but did not leave.</p>
<p>They appeared to be fully engaged in analyzing the recorded energy signals of the fortress and the structural data of the eye while simultaneously sending a brief technical consultation to the Inc. Abyss Pavilion through covert channels, inquiring about theoretical insights regarding the energy attenuation pattern of the dark red beam and possible defensive measures. Clearly, they had not given up and might even view this setback as a valuable data gathering opportunity. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood fell into an awkward silence. While Dragon Souls report didn&#x27;t directly name them, the accusation of illegally manufacturing war machines using ancient and dangerous technology undoubtedly pointed the finger at them.</p>
<p>Shind Wood&#x27;s informants reported that the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood&#x27;s energy base had completely lost external communications, suggesting a heated internal debate. Subsequently, they released a vague statement through a neutral media outlet stating that the Brotherhood is always committed to the peaceful research of ancient technology regrets and condemns any unauthorized misuse of technology that violates security ethics and will cooperate with relevant investigations, attempting to distance themselves, but the tone was weak. Most surprisingly, Vera&#x27;s team, almost forgotten, at this moment, sent a warning filled with static but clear to all ships and outposts capable of receiving the frequency via an extremely ancient plain text communication method based on longwave broadcasting. The forge is lit. The anvil is not controlled by the craftsman.</p>
<p>The old blade is being reforged. Its point not only against enemies. Beware, resonance is not the key, but also the fuse. Those who know should remain hidden until the embers cool. The metaphors of forge, anvil, and reforging old blades clearly point to the wings of Liberty&#x27;s use of the Brotherhood of Stonemason&#x27;s technology to restart and modify the fortress.</p>
<p>Resonance is both the key and the fuse, further emphasizing the danger of actively stimulating ancient systems. Ember cooling suggests that this crisis might eventually subside naturally. Vera&#x27;s team seems to have foreseen this outofcrol situation much earlier and at the most critical moment issued a subtle yet clear warning to all potential stakeholders. Lynn Mo synthesizing all the information stood before the constantly updated overall situation map. His mind racing the remnants of the wings of freedom possessed power beyond expectations.</p>
<p>But could they truly control this awakened ancient war machine? Judging from a fortress&#x27;s behavior, after opening its eyes, first dealing with harassment, the coral society, then assessing deterrence, the dragon soul, and finally entering standby mode, its underlying system possesses a high degree of autonomous judgment. The wings of freedom likely only set general objectives such as friend or foe identification, and how to achieve these objectives would probably be subject to the rules of that ancient anvil itself. For us, this presents both danger and opportunity. Lynn Emmo analyzed at the core meeting. The danger lies in the fact that an unpredictable entity with powerful military force, partially controlled by hostile forces, is entrenched in the waters not far to our southwest.</p>
<p>Its energy pollution and potential aggression directly threaten our security and shipping lanes. The opportunity lies in the focus of attention and the resulting checks and balances among various forces. Due to this event, he looked at everyone. Dragon Soul must deal with this immediate and real military threat with all its might. Its covetousness and suppression of our incoral society&#x27;s technology may temporarily ease.</p>
<p>The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is facing a crisis of trust and technological stigmatization, and its activities will be further restricted. The Coral Society has suffered a setback, but its research obsession remains unddeinished and it may become more reliant on data exchange with us. Vera&#x27;s team has reappeared to issue a warning indicating that they may have deeper inside information than anyone else and it is worth continuing to monitor them. Our strategy needs adjustment. Lynn Mo issued new instructions.</p>
<p>First, maintain the quiet abyss status, but shift the focus of internal research. Leewei and Sue Chanchian focus on analyzing the fortresses s energy characteristics, behavior patterns, and ecological impact, especially identifying potential weaknesses in its energy system, the external environmental conditions it depends on, and whether there are still observable pulses or vulnerabilities in its standby state. Second sure how based on the new threats revise our defense plan focusing on countermeasures against highintensity directed energy attacks large-scale ecological pollution and beyond visual range mobile strikes. Third Chin Duo Duo adjust the intelligence gathering direction to focus on monitoring the subsequent development of the standoff between Dragon Soul and the fortress. Investigate the movements and disagreements within the remnants of the wings of freedom after they gain control of the fortress.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the next moves of the coral society and various esteem and at the same time take advantage of the attention being diverted to cautiously advance the construction of our own resource network especially assessing the possibility of acquiring lei later. He concluded by emphasizing, &quot;We will not be the first to stick our necks out or actively intervene in conflicts, but we must be the ones who understand this reforged old blade best. We must see clearly its forging process, the texture of its materials, its sharpness, and whether the hand holding the knife is steady. Only in this way can we anticipate when the knife is actually swung in a certain direction and find room to dodge or respond.&quot; The awakened fortress, like a newly placed heavyweight piece on a chessboard, instantly altered the strategic thinking of all players. The Mo Yuan Pavilion chose to continue cultivating its own territory, silently calculating the movement rules and attack range of this new piece, accumulating strength in silence and waiting for the opportune moment.</p>
<p>All sides have begun their calculations, and undercurrents surged once more. Where this wave, jointly stirred by human ambition and ancient creations, would ultimately lead this sea was anyone&#x27;s guess. But one thing was certain. The peaceful days were gone forever. Chapter 132.</p>
<p>Heartbeat in the shadows. Morning light streamed through the reinforced glass skylight at the top of the command center, casting several clear streaks of light on the ground. Lynn Mo sat at the central control panel where three screens displayed an energy spectrum map, a heat map of marine biological distribution, and a real-time satellite cloud image to the southwest. He held a cup of now cold tea in his hand, his gaze slowly moving between the three screens. 48 hours have passed.</p>
<p>After its warning attack, Awakening Fortress returned to a state of apparent silence. However, the data continuously transmitted from the three unmanned underwater vehicles deployed by Moyuan Pavilion 300 nautical miles away told a different story. Leeway strode and carrying a tablet computer, his eyes showing obvious dark circles, but his voice betrayed barely suppressed excitement. Mr. Lynn, we&#x27;ve made a discovery.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo put down his teacup. Speak. Look at this. Leeway connected the tablet to the main screen and brought up a set of waveforms. These are the low-frequency sonar signals we collected from three submersibles at different locations and depths.</p>
<p>After 48 hours of continuous monitoring and filtering, we removed interference from ocean currents, geological activity, and conventional biological sound sources. Leaving this on the screen, along a nearly straight baseline, an extremely faint pulse signal appears approximately every 6 hours and 14 minutes. The pulse duration is very short, only 0.3 seconds. And the amplitude is also very low. So low that it would not be noticed at all unless an algorithm is used to extract it.</p>
<p>What is this? Lenmo leaned forward slightly. At first, we thought it was equipment noise or data processing error. Leewei operated the tablet and pulled up another set of comparative data, but the three underwater vehicles in different locations all recorded the exact same pulse waveform at the same time. The error was in the millisecond range. This is not a coincidence dot.</p>
<p>He zoomed in on the details of one of the pulses. Look at the characteristics of the waveform, a steep leading edge, an exponentially decaying trailing edge, and a spectrum concentrated in the ultra low frequency band of 0.1 to one herz. This is not a waveform that a natural phenomenon could produce. It has too clean. Is it from the fortress? Lynn Mo asked it as highly likely dot leeway pulled up a graph showing the correlation between the timing of the pulse and the location of the fortress.</p>
<p>Each time a pulse occurs, the background magnetic field at the location of the fortress will experience a slight synchronous disturbance. Although the disturbance amplitude is very small, our magnetometer array deployed on the seabed still detected it. Dot. Such an walked in at this moment holding several printed charts in her hand. My data can also corroborate this that she spread the charts on the table.</p>
<p>The background radiation level fluctuations recorded at our coral reef monitoring station, which is 50 nautical miles away, are correlated with the pulse cycle that Lee Wei discovered. About 15 minutes after each pulse, the radiation reading shows a small increase lasting about 20 minutes with an increase of 3% to 5%. She pointed to the curve on the chart. More crucial is the biological behavior data. The small number of radiation resistant algae and microorganisms remaining around the monitoring station show a significant inhibition of their metabolic rate and swimming activity within 2 hours after each pulse.</p>
<p>as if something pressed the pause button and then slowly resumed. Lynn Mo looked at the charts carefully and remained silent for a moment. A heartbeat every 6 hours and 14 minutes, he said softly. So that thing is really asleep. It s just in low power standby mode.</p>
<p>Every 6 hours or so, one of its core systems will wake up once to complete a selfch check or replenish some kind of energy and then enter hibernation agenda. Moreover, each heartbeat releases a trace amount of energy pollution into the surrounding environment. Suchin added. Although the single dose is very low if one is exposed to the radiation range of such periodic pulses for a long time, the cumulative damage to the ecosystem will be very serious. Coral reefs 50 nautical miles away have already begun to show signs of bleaching.</p>
<p>At this rate, that reef area will be completely dead in a month at most. Sure. how came in from outside the door and frowned when he heard the last few sentences. If it&#x27;s like this 50 nautical miles away, &quot;What about the area around the fortress?&quot; &quot;We Dant t have direct data,&quot; Leewi said frankly. &quot;Within 20 nautical miles of the fortress, all the probes we deployed have either lost contact or the data they sent back is completely garbled.</p>
<p>It s now a graveyard of electronic equipment. But based on energy decay models, we estimate that marine life within 20 nautical miles may have already been dying on an hourly basis. Dot. The command center was silent for a few seconds. Chinwood&#x27;s voice broke the silence through the communicator.</p>
<p>Everyone, I just received some intelligence updates. On the Dragon Soul side, their fleet has retreated to a point 60 nautical miles away to establish a blockade line. At the same time, they have dispatched three batches of 12 long endurance drones in total. attempting to establish 24-hour uninterrupted aerial surveillance. But interestingly, all the drones that flew within 40 nautical miles of the fortress experienced system malfunctions within 3 to 5 minutes and eventually either crashed into the sea or were forced to return just like our detector.</p>
<p>Leeway said, &quot;Yes, that s&#x27;s voice was thoughtful. Also, the Coral Society s research ships have withdrawn, but they have quietly deployed four deep sea buoy arrays. Judging from the signal characteristics, they should also be trying to monitor the fortress&#x27;s periodic activities. They acted very quickly. Doth, what about the remnants of wings of freedom? Lynn Mo asked.</p>
<p>There is no direct movement. The 40 nautical miles around the fortress are a black box right now. Our people can&#x27;t he get in and they can&#x27;t he get out if they were really still inside. Dot dua duo paused. But there an indirect indication.</p>
<p>In the past 48 hours, several batches of high-purity energy crystals and rare metal ingots of unknown origin have appeared on the black market. The shipments are small, but the quality is extremely high. The transactions are very secretive, involving at least three intermediaries. I suspect that the production facilities inside the fortress may still be operating, and the people inside are exchanging their products for external supplies, though. Lynn Mo&#x27;s fingers tapped lightly on the edge of the control panel.</p>
<p>My heart beats every 6 hours and 14 minutes. Periodic lowdose energy leakage, strong interference field on electronic devices, and internal production lines that may still be operating. These fragments gradually pieced together a clearer picture. It was an ancient war fortress that had been dormant for a long time, but whose basic functions had not been completely destroyed. Its control system was highly autonomous.</p>
<p>Its energy system could still maintain low power operation, and it may even have retained a certain degree of self-maintenance and production capabilities. The remnants of Wings of Liberty might be able to awaken it using resonance technology, giving it a simple command, such as IFF rules. But can they truly take complete control of every system in this fortress? Or have they simply pressed the start button and boarded an armored vehicle with its own navigation system when they don&#x27;t fully know how to drive? Continue monitoring. Lynn Mo finally said, &quot;Lewway, I need you to accurately calculate the time of the next pulse with an error margin of less than 3 minutes. Such an prepare a set of specially reinforced biochemical samplers.</p>
<p>After the next pole cycle ends, try to deploy them to the edge of the 30 nautical mile zone to collect water and sediment samples. We need to know exactly what substances are released with each heartbeat. Dot. He looked at sure how the revision of the defense plan needs to be accelerated. We need to focus on two scenarios.</p>
<p>First, if the fortress suddenly starts moving in our direction, how much warning time do we have and how should we plan the evacuation route? Second, if its energy leakage suddenly intensifies and the pollution area expands, how do we protect the core area? Finally, he said into the communicator, manager Chien, keep an eye on the unusual flow of supplies on the black market. If they really came from the fortress, try to trace them back to see who is receiving them. Also, contact the longwave band that Vera&#x27;s team used last time and send a short message using the same encrypted metaphor format. Send what? Just send two words, Lyno said. Heartbeat, how long? He need to know just how deep Vera&#x27;s team&#x27;s understanding of the fortress really was.</p>
<p>After the meeting, everyone went about their own business. Lynmo remained alone in the command center, pulling up all the data record from the past 48 hours and beginning to examine them frame by frame. He wasn&#x27;t looking for new discoveries, but rather trying to understand the behavioral logic of that ancient creation. Why 6 hours and 14 minutes? Does this cycle length have any special significance? Is it an inherent rhythm of some kind of energy replenishment cycle or a standby wake up interval set by the system to reduce energy consumption? If it&#x27;s the former, it means the fortress&#x27;s energy system may rely on some mechanism that requires periodic recharging, such as drawing energy from geothermal energy, ocean currents, or even tides. If it&#x27;s the latter, it indicates that its control system is still engaged in complex energy management, which in itself suggests a high level of system intelligence.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo prefers the latter. From the moment the fortress opened its eyes to the attack and then closed again to enter standby mode, the entire process demonstrated a clear focus on target prioritization and resource conservation. It didn&#x27;t indiscriminately attack all units entering its warning range, but instead chose the Coral Society ships, known for their harassment capabilities, to issue a warning with minimal cost against the Dragon Soul Fleet. It merely displayed its opened eyes status to exert deterrence without actually firing. This restraint doesn&#x27;t resemble a completely out of control war machine.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s more like a GAR with established basic rules, self-defense, expelling threats, but with the authority to execute them autonomously. So, here&#x27;s the question. Are the remnants of Wings of Liberty truly its owners? Or perhaps they simply triggered some ancient emergency plan, causing the sleeping guardian to temporarily identify them as objects in need of protection. As dusk fell, Suchian brought in a simple dinner. still thinking, she placed a plate next to Lynmo.</p>
<p>Lynmo took the plate and thanked him. I feel like we&#x27;ve overlooked some crucial clue. Such Chian sat down in the chair next to him and looked at the pulse waveform frozen on screen. Leewi said that the waveform of that pulse was too clean, unlike a natural product. she said softly.</p>
<p>I actually had a similar feeling the fortresses impact on the surrounding ecology, although deadly, was controlled very precisely in terms of its range. Coral reefs 50 nautical miles away began to bleach, but the same corals 51 nautical miles away were significantly less damaged. It asked like there is an invisible boundary dot. She paused for a moment. This reminds me of an experiment I did in the lab before.</p>
<p>Bacteria were inoculated into a petri dish and then a small amount of antibiotic was added at a specific location which created an inhibition zone. The colonies inside the zone died while those outside grew normally. The edge of that inhibition zone was often very clear. Linmo stopped picking up food with his chopsticks. He slowly put down his chopsticks and pulled up a map showing the distribution of ecological impacts within a 50 nautical mile radius of the fortress.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian is right. Monitoring data shows that the impact of energy pollution does not decrease smoothly with increasing distance. In a 45 to 50 nautical mile range, the decline curves of various indicators show a significant steep drop. Within 50 nautical miles, biological mortality, radiation levels, and water pollution indices remain at a relatively high plateau. But once beyond 50 nautical miles, these indicators plummet.</p>
<p>50 nautical miles. Lynn Emmo murmured. Is this a set radius of influence? If it is natural diffusion, the boundary of influence should be blurred and gradual. However, if it is the output of a system that is actively controlled, then setting a fixed range of influence would be much more reasonable. It doesn&#x27;t t want to escalate the situation, Lynn Emmo suddenly said.</p>
<p>Or rather, its procedures include some kind of pollution control clause. While completing its self-defense expulsion mission, it tries to minimize collateral damage to the surrounding environment. A war machine that considers environmental protection. Such an felt this idea was somewhat contradictory. Or perhaps its original design purpose wasn&#x27;t he entirely for war.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo looked at the outline of the metal fortress on the screen. Remember the concepts mentioned in the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhoodes documents. Guardian Art Core Civilization Preservation Protocol dot. He pulled up a summary of the data he had previously compiled. If it really is a preservation facility left behind by a lost civilization, then its primary task is probably protecting designated targets in a crisis and only secondarily eliminating threats and protection often includes considerations of maintaining environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian pondered this possibility. Therefore, the remnants of the wings of freedom triggered its protection protocol, registering themselves as objects requiring protection. The approach of the dragon soul and the coral society was judged by the system as a potential threat. So, it initiated the expulsion procedure. However, at the same time, its system still follows the underlying logic of minimizing environmental damage.</p>
<p>So the energy output was controlled within a 50 nautical mile radius and the attack method was chosen to be the most targeted electronic paralysis rather than physical destruction. This is just speculation, Linimo said, but what if it&#x27;s true? He didn&#x27;t finish speaking, but Sue Chanchin understood what he meant. If that&#x27;s the case, then the remnants of the Wings of Liberty are in a more precarious situation than anyone imagines. They&#x27;ve awakened a protector, but this protector has its own rules of conduct. Once their actions conflict with the systems preservation protocol, who knows if the blade will turn on them? It&#x27;s late at night.</p>
<p>Lynmo told Sue Chian to go and rest first. While he stayed in the command center, he created a new encrypted entry in his work log titled Seven Assumptions about the behavioral logic of the awakening eye. He began writing line by line. I wrote very slowly and for each point I wrote, I had to repeatedly examine whether the evidence was sufficient and whether the logic was consistent. As he wrote the fourth item, Leewi&#x27;s slightly tired but accomplished voice came through the communicator.</p>
<p>Mr. Lynn, the timing of the next pulse has been calculated. It is expected to occur at 4:22 a.m. tomorrow with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 minutes. All monitoring equipment is ready.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo glanced at the time. It is 11:17 p.m. now. Less than 5 hours remain until the ancient fortress experiences its next heartbeat. Received, he replied.</p>
<p>Keep the night shift staff on high alert. Also, conduct a full band electromagnetic environment scan at three time points. 10 minutes before the pulse occurs, during the pulse, and 30 minutes after the pulse occurs. I need to know if besides that low frequency pulse, it releases any other signals that we haven&#x27;t noticed before when a heart beats that. Clear.</p>
<p>Communication was cut off. Linmo leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes, and let his thoughts settle. That silent metal fortress at this moment is breathing slowly in the deep sea more than 100 nautical miles away, according to an ancient rhythm of 6 hours and 14 minutes. With every breath, a tiny amount of death is injected into this sea. But at the same time, every breath may also reveal its secret.</p>
<p>What a Moyunga needs to do is to listen carefully to this regular heartbeat and piece together the outline of the truth and those faint signals that are almost drowned out by the background noise of the ocean. This is a contest that requires patience. What Lin Mo has in abundance is patience. He turned off most of the screens, leaving only a real-time satellite image of the southwestern sea area. on the deep blue sea.</p>
<p>The dot representing the dragon&#x27;s soul fleet rested silently 60 nautical miles away. Further away, the location of the fortress was marked only by a simple red marker. Everything seemed calm, but Lynn Emmo knew that beneath that sea, an ancient heartbeat was counting down. With each heartbeat, something is quietly changing. He picked up the tea, which had gone completely cold, and took a sip.</p>
<p>The bitterness melts on the tip of the tongue, yet it&#x27;s very refreshing. 5 hours later, they will hear the next heartbeat. And every time you listen, you may get one step closer to the truth. That&#x27;s enough. Chapter 133 before the pulse.</p>
<p>3:40 a.m. The underground command center of my pavilion was brightly lit, but unusually quiet. The only sounds were the low hum of the equipment and the occasional tapping of keyboards. The air was filled with a mixed sense of strong coffee and stimulant ointment. Linmo sat in front of the control panel, his eyes fixed on the countdown screen.</p>
<p>The screen displays the light blue number, 41 minutes and 22 seconds. There are 41 minutes and 22 seconds left until the predicted heartbeat pulse occurs. Leeway walked over from the monitoring area holding a freshly printed equipment status report. His eyes were bloodshot, but he was highly focused. All 37 monitoring points have been confirmed to be online that he handed the report to Lynn Mo, including 15 deep sea submersibles, 12 surface buoys, six seabed seismometer arrays, and four high altitude UAV relay stations.</p>
<p>Data links are stable, and a redundant backup system has been activated. Lenmo took the report and quickly glanced at it. The coordinates, status, remaining battery power, and signal strength of each set of devices were listed in detail. Most devices were in optimal working condition except for two deep sea submersibles whose batteries degraded 15% faster than expected due to prolonged stays in high radiation edge areas. But this was still within the safe threshold.</p>
<p>Can the equipment withstand the pulse before and after it occurs? Linmo asked it should be possible. Dot leeway pointed to a few lines of data on the report. We have installed simple Faraday cages and filter circuits on all equipment within 50 nautical miles of the fortress. This should prevent direct physical damage from low-frequency pulses, but we cannot guarantee against communication interference. When a pulse occurs, the data stream within 40 nautical miles is likely to be interrupted, so we need to be prepared.</p>
<p>How long will the interruption last? Watch the pulse intensity. If it&#x27;s the same as last time, it might only last a few seconds. But if the intensity changes this time, Leewi didn&#x27;t finish his sentence, but his meaning was clear. Lynmo nodded and put the report aside. He pulled up real time monitoring footage of the fortress&#x27;s surroundings.</p>
<p>16 split screens displayed scenes from different angles and depths dark seaater. The occasional bioluminescent creatures swimming by and silt and coral remnants piled up on the seabed. Everything looked eerily calm. Such Chan walked over carrying a tray with several cups of hot drinks on it. She placed a cup of tea next to Lin Mo, handed a cup of coffee to Leewi, and kept a cup of warm water for herself.</p>
<p>&quot;How are the preparations going with the biological monitoring team?&quot; Lynn Mo asked, taking a teacup. The sample collectors are in place. Sue Chanchian sat down on the chair next to her. We have deployed three sets of automatic samplers at each of the four distances of 32 nautical miles, 37 nautical miles, 42 nautical miles, and 47 nautical miles. After the pulse is generated, they will automatically collect water samples and surface sediments at four time points: midnight, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour according to the pre-programmed procedure.</p>
<p>She paused, then added. In addition, we have set up a set of live organism observation cages on the edge of trench 45 nautical miles away. Inside are 20 different species of radiation resistant crustations and small fish. After the pulse occurs, we will remotely monitor their physiological indicators and behavioral changes. Very thorough, Linmo said.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all we can do. Such an took a sip of water. If we go any closer, the equipment will malfunction and no living organisms will survive. We can only capture gradient changes from the outside. Shh walked over from the defense command area, holding a tablet in his hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Lynn, the evacuation plan has been updated. He handed over the tablet. If the fortress suddenly starts moving and heads towards us based on its possible speed, we have at least a 4 to 6 hour warning window. There are three main evacuation routes leading to three pre-desated safe points in the northeast, east, and southeast directions.</p>
<p>Each route has a support fleet and supply station. He pulled up a 3D nautical chart and drew a route with his finger. However, there&#x27;s a problem here. If the pollution area expands, the southeast route will pass through the potential affected area. So, the priority is northeast due east and southeast.</p>
<p>What about personnel training? Lynn Mo asked. Core members and essential technical personnel have completed the first round of emergency evacuation drills. Shouse said the prepackaging plan for supplies has also been issued. If we really need to leave, we can complete the loading of 60% of the personnel and key supplies onto the ship within 2 hours and complete the entire process within 4 hours. Lynn Mo carefully examined the evacuation route map and remained silent for a few seconds.</p>
<p>I hope I won&#x27;t need it, he finally said. I hope so too. Sure, how put away his tablet, but it&#x27;s never a bad thing to be prepared. Chinwood&#x27;s voice came through the communicator, breaking the brief silence. Everyone, I just received two new intelligence reports.</p>
<p>His voice was a little clearly indicating that he hadn&#x27;t rested. First, regarding Dragon Soul, their drone squadron attempted a close-in reconnaissance around 2:00 a.m., and the result was the same as before after entering the 40 nautical mile range. Three drones lost contact one after another, and one barely managed to fly back, but its navigation system and image sensors were completely burned out. &quot;They haven&#x27;t given up yet,&quot; Leeway asked. &quot;Not only did they not give up, they increased their investment instead,&quot; Chien Duodo said.</p>
<p>According to inside information, Dragon Soul has deployed two reconnaissance ships equipped with the latest electronic warfare systems, which are now slowly approaching the fortress from 100 nautical miles away. It seems they intend to use their stronger anti-jamming capabilities to force their way into that 40 nautical mile restricted area. Lynn Mo frowned. Did you tell them about the radiation levels within 40 nautical miles? I did, but they seem more concerned with military threat assessments. Sheen Duo Duo paused.</p>
<p>The second intelligence regarding various team as you requested. We sent that encrypted message using the longwave band. We received a reply 6 hours later. What is the content? Only four words and it s as a metaphor. Shend woodwe became serious.</p>
<p>Heartbeat is breathing. Breathing requires energy. Dot. The command center was silent for a few seconds. Heartbeat is breathing.</p>
<p>Suchian repeated softly. Does that mean the fortresses s pulse is not only a selfch check but also a necessary cycle to maintain vital signs. Breathing requires energy? Leewi continued. So where does that energy come from? The fortress has been dormant there for who knows how long. If it has been breathing every 6 hours, what is its energy source? Lyno did not speak immediately.</p>
<p>He pulled up a geological map of the sea area where the fortress was located. That area was situated on the edge of the continental shelf with a seabed depth between 1,500 and 2,000 m. The geological activity was relatively calm with no obvious hydrothermal vents or volcanic activity. As for ocean currents, that area is where two warm currents converge with a moderate flow rate, but not enough to provide much kinetic energy. Tidal energy, solar radiation energy.</p>
<p>These energy densities are too low. Unless, Linway said suddenly, looking at a detail on the geological map, it has connected to something we haven t discovered yet. Dot. He zoomed in on a corner of the seabed structure diagram about 3 km below the fortress. Geological scans revealed a massive, unusually regular dome-shaped structure.</p>
<p>Due to its depth and severe signal attenuation, this detail had not received particular attention in previous geological explorations. What is this? Sherhow leaned closer to take a look. Adantino. Weii pulled up more primitive sonar data. The shape is too regular, unlike a naturally formed geological structure.</p>
<p>The initial estimate of the size is that the diameter may exceed 5 km. Lynn Emmo stared at the blurry outline of the dome. 5 km in diameter. If it really was an artificial structure and there was some kind of connection between it and the fortress above. How much longer until the pulse occurs? He asked.</p>
<p>32 minutes. Leeway glanced at the countdown. Shift the focus of some monitoring equipment to that dome area. Lynn Mo decided when the pulse occurs, focus on recording any signs that might indicate energy transfer such as seabed vibrations, water temperature changes, and magnetic field disturbances. Understood.</p>
<p>Leeway immediately returned to his control panel and began to reassign monitoring tasks. Such Chanchan also stood up. I asked the biology team to pay attention to the activity of plankton in the water above the dome. If there&#x27;s a large-scale energy transfer, even if it is very weak, it may cause abnormal biological behavior. Time passed second by second.</p>
<p>The countdown has entered its final 20 minutes. The atmosphere in the command center grew increasingly tense. Everyone returned to their posts, staring at their screens, waiting for that moment to arrive. Lyn and Mo finished the tea in his cup, which had already gone cold. He glanced at the time for 05 a.m.</p>
<p>There is still 17 minutes until the predicted pulse occurs. Another brief message came from Shien Duo Duo. Dragon Souls reconnaissance ship has entered the 50 nautical mile range, moving very slowly, as if it&#x27;s testing something. In addition, another batch of high purity crystals has appeared on the black market. This time in larger quantities, and the price is 20% lower.</p>
<p>The seller seems to be in a bit of a hurry. In a hurry? Linmo caught the word. If the remnants of the Wings of Liberty truly control the fortress and can use its production lines to manufacture supplies, why would they be in such a hurry to ship them out? Unless they need to quickly acquire some external resource in return or perhaps they encountered some trouble. Keep an eye on it, Linmo replied. Pay special attention to whether anyone is buying large quantities of medical supplies, food, or radiation protection equipment.</p>
<p>Receive. The countdown has entered its final 10 minutes. Leeway began to verify the status of the entire system. All monitoring points report status. Submarine array normal.</p>
<p>Buoy network normal. Seismograph array normal. Drone relay normal. Biosampling team in position. Environmental sensors in place.</p>
<p>A series of confirmation sounds rang out in the command center. Each voice tense and strained. Lin Mo pulled up a comprehensive situation map of the area where the fortress was located. On the deep blue sea, two points of light representing the Dragon Soul Reconnaissance ship were slowly moving, approaching the 45 nautical mile mark. Further away, the red marker representing the fortress stood silently like a time bomb.</p>
<p>5 minutes left in the countdown. Such Chian suddenly whispered, &quot;The creatures in the observation cage at 47 nautical miles are starting to show signs of agitation. Some crustaceans are randomly bumping around in the cage and the fish are gathering in the corners. These are early signs of stress. Can I sense it?&quot; Sure, how asked.</p>
<p>Possibly, do Sue Chanchian stared at the monitoring screen. Sometimes living organisms are more sensitive to electromagnetic fields and radiation than instruments. In particular, species that have lived in areas with high radiation backgrounds for a long time may have evolved some kind of early warning mechanism. Dot. 3 minutes left in countdown.</p>
<p>Leeway began the final equipment calibration. All recording systems enter highest sampling frequency mode. Backup power switch to standby. Data buffer pool has been cleared. Ready to receive peak traffic.</p>
<p>2 minutes left in a countdown. Lynn and Mo noticed that the two reconnaissance ships of Dragon Soul stopped at a distance of 43 nautical miles and stopped moving forward. Did they receive a warning as well or did their equipment detect some early signs? One minute countdown. The entire command center was so quiet you could hear someone breathing. Everyone stared at their screens, fingers hovering over the control buttons, ready to respond to any unexpected situations.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo watched as the countdown numbers decreased from 60 59 58 57. He suddenly remembered the words that she and Duo Duo had conveyed. Heartbeat is breathing and breathing requires energy. If this ancient fortress is indeed breathing, then each breath means that it is consuming energy and also acquiring energy. So what will this breath reveal? 30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Leeway began counting down. 5 4 3 2 1. Time resets to zero. Everyone&#x27;s eyes were fixed on the monitoring screen. 1 second.</p>
<p>2 seconds. 3 seconds. Nothing happened. The expected pulse signal did not appear. Inside the command center, only the hum of the equipment could be heard.</p>
<p>Leeway frowned and quickly checked all the monitoring channels. All sensor readings are normal. No abnormal signals were detected. No pulse occurred. Is it delayed? Such Chanchin asked.</p>
<p>Possibly dot Lee way stare at the time. The last time we observed a period of 6 hours and 14 minutes, but that was based on the average of three observations. The actual period may fluctuate by a few minutes. Dot. Wait five more minutes.</p>
<p>Lenmo said time passed in silence. Every second felt incredibly long. 4:27 a.m. 5 minutes have passed since the predicted time. There&#x27;s still nothing there.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls reconnaissance ship remained at a distance of 43 nautical miles, neither advancing nor retreating. The creature in the cage showed some relief from its agitation, but was still not completely calm. &quot;Something&#x27;s not right,&quot; Leeway murmured. &quot;Even with fluctuations, the deviation shouldn&#x27;t exceed 5 minutes. Unless before he could finish speaking, the energy monitoring graph on the main screen suddenly jumped is not a pulse.</p>
<p>Instead, it&#x27;s a continuously rising curve. The index representing the background radiation level is rising at a slow but steady pace. Starting from the baseline, 5% 10% 15%. This isn&#x27;t pulse. Such an stared at the curve.</p>
<p>This is a slow release. Lin Mo immediately retrieved the data from the other sensors. Seawater temperature monitoring sea at a depth of 2 km directly below the fortress. The water temperature is rising at a rate of 0.1° per minute. The magnetic field strength fluctuated three times more than usual and the frequency was chaotic.</p>
<p>Seabed vibrations C seismographs recorded continuous low frequency tremors with a focal depth of about 3 km which corresponds exactly to the location of the dome structure. It&#x27;s taking a breath. Lyn Mo suddenly said, &quot;What?&quot; Leewi didn&#x27;t hear clearly. It asks not a short rapid heartbeat but slow continuous breathing. Lin Mo pointed to the synchronously changing curves.</p>
<p>Energy is being continuously released and absorbed. That dome is likely an energy source or a cooling system. He glanced at the time 4:31 a.m. This breathing process has lasted for 4 minutes and is still continuing. All monitoring devices adjust recording mode.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo instructed this is not a momentary event but a continuous state. What we need to record is the complete waveform of the entire process as well as the phase relationship between the various parameters. Understood. Leeway immediately began operating the system. Such an also realized biology group.</p>
<p>Please note that the pattern of ecological impact from this continuous release may be completely different from that of a pulse. Record the time series of all abnormal behaviors. The command center is busy again, but this busy period had a different rhythm. It&#x27;s no longer about capturing a fleeting signal, but about recording a slow, potentially long breathing process. Lyn Mo sat back in his chair, watching the continuously rising curve on the screen.</p>
<p>He realized that their understanding of this ancient fortress might have been misguided from the very beginning. Is not a heart that beats once every 6 hours. Instead, it is a lung that is breathing slowly, and each breath may be far more complex than they imagine. A faint glimmer of dawn began to appear in the sky outside the window. A new day is about to begin, and that fortress sleeping in the deep sea is awakening in its own way.</p>
<p>Chapter 134, Continuous Breathing. 6:20 a.m. The screen in the command center showed that the energy release had been going on for nearly 2 hours. The red curve representing the background radiation level after climbing to 237% of its initial value finally began to show signs of leveling off. The rate of increase slowed significantly like a long-d distanceance runner&#x27;s final struggle as they approached the finish line.</p>
<p>Leeway rubbed his sore eyes and projected the latest data onto the main screen. The release rate is starting to decline. Dot his voice was tired but also excited. It has dropped from 1.8% 8% per minute at its peak to 0.3%. Now, at this rate, it may plateau or start to decline in another 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>Dot, what about the water temperature? Lynn Mo asked. Synchronized. Leeway pulled up another set of data. The seawater temperature 2,000 m directly below the fortress rose from an initial 3.2° C to a high of 5.7° C and is now stable at 5.6°. The heat source seems to be weakening.</p>
<p>Such Chian walked over from the biological monitoring area holding several printed charts in her hand. The ecological impact is obvious that she spread out the charts. In the observation cages we set up at 47 nautical miles, six out of the 20 experimental organisms have died in the past 2 hours. The deaths occur between the 90th and 110th minutes after the energy release began. She circled several time points with her pen.</p>
<p>Living individuals also exhibited severe stress responses metabolic rates generally decreased by more than 40%. And swimming activity was almost zero. Moreover, she paused then pointed to the last chart. Our plankton samplers deployed at four different distances collected large numbers of dead single-sellled algae. Even at the furthest point, 47 nautical miles away, the alba mortality rate was eight times higher than usual.</p>
<p>Is the scope of the impact still expanding? Sure, how asked. No, the impact is expanding, Sue Chenshin corrected. The range is still roughly within 50 nautical miles, but the degree of ecological damage within those 50 nautical miles is increasing exponentially as the release time lengthens. If this breathing state continues for more than 4 hours, I suspect that all multisellular organisms within those 50 nautical miles will die dot. There was a few seconds of silence in the command center.</p>
<p>All died. That means that the area will become a complete no-go zone for life. Where is Dragon Souls reconnaissance ship? Lyn Emmo turned to Chin Duo Duo. Chandwood&#x27;s voice came through the communicator. They&#x27;re still at 43 nautical miles.</p>
<p>According to the fragmented communications we intercepted, their shipboard sensors have also detected continuous energy release. Two hours ago, they tried to retreat 5 nautical miles, but it seems they&#x27;ve stopped again. They&#x27;re probably waiting for orders from higher command. Any new developments? Yes, that s voice turns serious. 15 minutes ago, Dragon Soul dispatched two special engineering vessels from the rear.</p>
<p>Judging from their appearance, they should be models used for deep sea operations and sample collection. They may be planning to try to get close and collect water samples or something else after the energy release is overdot. What about the remnants of the wings of liberty? No movement. Chin duo duo said the area within 40 nautical miles of the fortress remains a black box. However, the price of that batch of crystals on the black market has dropped by another 15% in the past 2 hours.</p>
<p>It has now almost half the price of similar products on the market. The seller is very eager to get rid of it. Lynn and Mo leaned back his chair, his fingers tapping lightly on the armrest. Energy is continuously released. Ecosystems are dying out at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>Wings of Liberty are in a hurry to sell their merchandise. Dragon Soul is preparing to collect samples. There should be a connecting line between these fragments. Leewei, he suddenly spoke. If a dormant ancient facility suddenly begins to release energy continuously for an extended period of time, what could be the reason? Leeway pondered for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Several possibilities. First, a system malfunction resulting in energy leakage. Second, the activation of a high energy consuming functional module such as weapon charging, shield generation, or large scale production. Third, he paused for a moment. It&#x27;s going through a necessary maintenance cycle.</p>
<p>Just like a person turns over and adjusts their position when they sleep, a system that&#x27;s been dormant for a long time may need to stretch its muscles periodically to prevent its components from aging and becoming stiff. Which one do you think it is? The third possibility is the most likely dotly way pulled up the spectrum analysis chart of the energy release. You see, although the spectrum of the release is complex, there are obvious periodic fluctuations. Every 17 to 18 minutes, there is a small fluctuation in intensity and the fluctuation pattern is almost exactly the same. This does not seem like a fault leak, but more like a regular cycle.</p>
<p>Dot. Sue Chanchian leaned closer to take a look. Doesn&#x27;t it look like blood circulation? The heart pumps blood, the blood flows throughout the body, and then flows back. That is somewhat true. dot leeway nodded.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then this fortress might be undergoing a full system energy cycle. It s sending the stored energy to each subsystem, activating them, checking their status, and then recycling it. The whole process would take several hours. Then why was it a short pulse every 6 hours before, but now it&#x27;s a continuous release? Sure. How asked it as possible that it was in a light sleep before and now it is in a deep sleep maintenance phase.</p>
<p>Leeway speculated or the remnants of Wings of Liberty triggered a higher level protocol causing the system to enter a different operating mode. Lenmo looked at the energy curve on the screen which was beginning to flatten out. The release has lasted for 2 hours and 17 minutes. According to Leewi&#x27;s speculation, if this is a complete system cycle, it may be coming to an end soon. Notify all monitoring stations.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo said, &quot;The energy release may be coming to an end. After it&#x27;s over, be sure to record any unusual changes, sudden drops in temperature, magnetic field reversals, changes in seabed vibration patterns, don&#x27;t miss anything.&quot; Clear? Furthermore, Lynn Mo added, &quot;After the release is completely ceased, arrange for two groups of hardened underwater vehicles to attempt to enter the 45 nautical mile zone. Do not venture too deep. Collect data just at the edge. If Dragon Souls engineering vessels move, we must obtain firsthand information before they do, the risk is very high, Leewi warned.</p>
<p>Although the radiation level may decrease after the release, the interference field may not necessarily disappear. So, we&#x27;ll use a ruggedized version and only up to 45 nautical miles. Lyno said, &quot;If the sensors malfunction, we&#x27;ll retreat immediately. We don&#x27;t need to risk our lives. We just need to be one step ahead of Dragon Soul.&quot; After the order was issued, each department began preparations.</p>
<p>Such Chian returned to the biom monitoring area and began designing a post-release bio-reovery observation plant. She needed to know how long it would take for the ecosystem to begin self-repairing after such an intense energy shock, if it could even repair itself. Sherhow then began to reassess the evacuation time window. If the fortress&#x27;s breathing pattern changed, then its behavioral logic and movement probability needed to be recalculated. He retrieved all known data and began modeling and simulation.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo continued to monitor the movements of all parties. Dragon Souls engineering vessel was already on standby 40 nautical miles away, waiting only for the energy release to finish. The Coral Society&#x27;s research buoy array was also continuing to operate. They clearly hadn&#x27;t given up. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, however, remains silent.</p>
<p>7:05 a.m. The energy release has entered its third hour. The curve has flattened out completely with the value remaining at about 98% of the peak level, and there are no longer any significant fluctuations. The water temperature also remains stable at 5.6° C. Seabed vibrations have weakened to the point of being almost undetectable.</p>
<p>It has almost over dot leeway stare to the data stream. All the indicators show that the system is wrapping up. Dot 7:23. The red curve on the main screen began to descend without warning. It was a slow descent, but an almost vertical drop.</p>
<p>Within just 3 minutes, radiation levels plummeted from 241% of their peak to 120% of their initial value and then continued to decline. The water temperature dropped simultaneously from 5.6° 6° to 3.5°. The magnetic field strength has returned to its normal fluctuation range. The seabed vibrations have completely stopped. Is it over? Suchinian asked.</p>
<p>Not yet. Leewi pointed to the screen. Look, it hasn&#x27;t stabilized after dropping to the baseline. It&#x27;s still declining. As expected, the curve did not stop after touching the initial value and continued to decline.</p>
<p>90% 80% 70% 7:31 a.m. The radiation level eventually stabilized at 62% of the initial value. It was nearly 40% lower than before breathing began. The energy is being recycled. Leeway suddenly realized it&#x27;s not just releasing, it&#x27;s also absorbing.</p>
<p>It releases for 2 hours, then reclaims the dissipated energy at an even faster rate. It&#x27;s like taking a deep breath, inhaling more than you exhale. Where does the extra energy come from? Sure, how asked. All eyes were drawn to the enormous dome-shaped structure beneath the seabed. Lyn Mo pulled up the real-time monitoring footage of that area.</p>
<p>Because of the great depth, the image was blurry and all that could be seen was darkness. However, a seismograph installed on the nearby seabed recorded a faint but clear set of vibration signals originating from inside the dome and propagating upwards toward the fortress. It asked drawing energy from below. Linmo said that dome is its energy source. Each breath is an energy exchange and replenishment dot.</p>
<p>Then why did the radiation level decrease instead? Suchian asked puzzled. If energy was replenished, the background radiation should have increased. It&#x27;s probably because it recovers not only the radiation it releases, but also the background radiation that already exists in the environment. Leeway speculated its energy system has a purification or conversion function, turning radiation pollution into usable clean energy. So after breathing it out, the surrounding environment is actually cleanered.</p>
<p>This speculation silenced the command center for a few seconds. An ancient war machine capable of purifying radiation pollution. This sounds so contradictory. Is the underwater vehicle ready? Lynn Mo broke the silence. Both teams are in position.</p>
<p>Leeway replied. They could depart at any time. Depart. Destination 45 nautical miles. Collect water and sediment samples and measure real-time radiation levels and magnetic field strength.</p>
<p>If any anomalies are detected, immediately retreat. Clear. Two sets of ruggedized underwater vehicles departed from the outer base of Mayuin Pavilion and headed southwest. They move slowly, remain hidden, and avoid attracting the attention of the dragon soul. The first group of underwater vehicles reached the 45 nautical mile boundary.</p>
<p>The transmitted data showed that radiation levels were indeed only about 65% of what was predicted. The magnetic field was stable and the water temperature was normal. Continue forward to 44 nautical miles, Linmo MO ordered. The submersible moved forward slowly. 8:19.</p>
<p>Entering the 44 nautical mile zone, the data began to fluctuate. Radiation levels have risen slightly to 71%. Regular minor disturbances have appeared in the magnetic field. Water temperature shows an extremely slight upward trend. Stop here, Lyno said.</p>
<p>collect samples, perform a full range scan, and then retreat to the 45 nautical mile line. Clear. The underwater vehicle began operation. A robotic arm extends to collect surface sediment. A water pump extracts seawater samples.</p>
<p>Various sensors operate at full power, recording every detail of this sea area that has just experienced breathing. Just then, Chindwood&#x27;s voice came through the communicator, sounding urgent. Dragon Souls engineering ships have moved. Both are heading towards the fortress at a considerable speed. At this rate, they will approach from the northeast and are expected to be within 45 nautical miles of the fortress within an hour.</p>
<p>Let them go first, Lin Mo said calmly. Our underwater vehicle will withdraw after collecting the samples. Don&#x27;t run into them. Understood. Also, Chin Duodo paused.</p>
<p>The Coral Society is also making moves. They deployed a small unmanned submarine approaching from the west. It s quite small probably trying to get the data before the dragon soul dive. It&#x27;s a race among many parties. Sure house said.</p>
<p>Then let&#x27;s see who gets more valuable data. Lynmo looked at the real-time footage transmitted back by the submarine on the screen. The seabed at 44 nautical miles is now quite different from what it was before. The seabed is covered with a layer of fine grayish white sediment resembling the remains of some kind of organism or mineral deposits. Deep sea coral reefs, once ubiquitous, are now almost nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Even the most common tube worms and sponges are pitifully scarce. This seabed looks like it has been carefully cleaned. It was so clean it was unsettling. The submersible robotic arm scooped up a handful of sediment and loaded it into the sample chamber. Just then, the sensor suddenly sounded an alarm.</p>
<p>The magnetic field strength increased by 300% within 5 seconds. The water temperature rose 2° instantly. Retreat. Lynn Mo immediately ordered full speed back to the 45 nautical mile line. The submarine&#x27;s thrusters started at full power and it changed direction.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The image on the home screen began to shake violently, then turned into static. Data stream interrupted. The communication signal disappeared. Loss of contact.</p>
<p>Dotly ways voice tightened. The last data transmitted back showed they were still moving but all the sensors failed. The navigation system may also be can it be found if the autonomous driving program is still working. They will return along the preset route. Leeway stared at the control panel but without navigation relying solely on inertia.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t finish speaking. In a command center, everyone stared at the blank screen, the 44 nautical mile line. There&#x27;s something there still moving. It&#x27;s not the fortress itself. It&#x27;s something else.</p>
<p>8:47 a.m., 28 minutes after losing contact, one of the underwater vehicles reappeared shakily within 46 nautical miles of the monitoring area. It has obvious scratches on its outer shell, and one of the thrusters has stopped working, but it is still moving with difficulty. The other group never appeared again. Leeway immediately initiated the recovery process, dispatching a speedboat to tow the damaged submarine back. 9:20 a.m.</p>
<p>The underwater vehicle was transported back to base. The sample chamber was intact, but all of its electronic equipment, including the black box, was burned out, completely scrapped. Meanwhile, Dragon Souls engineering vessel had already reached the 45 nautical mile mark. Their adventure has only just begun. Chapter 135.</p>
<p>The secret in the sample sea. Inside the Moyuan biological laboratory, the lights were brightly lit. The ventilation system emitted a low hum and there was a faint smell of disinfectant in the air. Suchan dressed in a white lab coat, goggles, and gloves stood in front of the control panel. On the panel were two transparent sealed sample containers, both retrieved from the submarine that had miraculously returned.</p>
<p>One jar contained a seawater sample about 500 ml. The other jar contained sediment, a fine grayish white powder, and was about half full. Leeway stood to the side holding a tablet computer, ready to take notes. Lynn Emmo stood in front of the observation window, watching the operation inside through the glass. Measure the radiation level first, Such Chian said.</p>
<p>She took out a handheld radiation detector, calibrated it, and then held it close to the seawater sample container. The numbers on the instrument screen fluctuated a few times before stabilizing at 0.18 microcevers. About 65% of the normal background value. She recorded the data, which is consistent with the data last transmitted back by the submersible dot. Next, the sediment samples were examined.</p>
<p>As soon as the instrument approached, the numbers began to climb rapidly. 0.35 0.67 1.12 1.89 finally settling at 2.41 microceverts per hour. The radiation levels in the sediments are 13 times higher than in seawater. Sue Chanchan frowned. This is no ordinary silt.</p>
<p>She carefully opened the sediment sample container, took out a small amount of powder with a sampling spoon, placed it on a glass slide, and pushed it under the microscope. Adjust the focus. A patch of grayish white granular material appeared in my field of vision. The particles were uneven in size, irregular in shape, and had a somewhat rough surface. It s not a mineral crystal, Sue Chian said softly.</p>
<p>It s more like a fragment of a biological calcium skeleton, but the structure is very strange. Dot. She switched to a higher magnification objective lens. The field of vision is narrowed. The details of those grayish white particles are clearer.</p>
<p>The surface has a fine porous structure like the skeleton of a sponge or some kind of coral. But the arrangement of the pores is very regular presenting a spiral geometric pattern. This is not a naturally formed biological structure. Such Chanchian looked up. It s too regular.</p>
<p>The skeletons of organisms in nature also follow a pattern, but this precise spiral arrangement looks like it was designed. Leewi leaned closer to take a look. It looks like some kind of filtering structure or an energy conduction structure. Anything is possible. Such an took another sample and put it into another device.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll do an elemental analysis. The equipment started operating. The laser shown on the sample and the spectrometer captured the reflected signal. A few minutes later, the results came out. The main component is calcium carbonate accounting for 87%.</p>
<p>The rest are silicates, trace metal elements, and about 1.3% unknown substances, which have no matching entries in the spectral feature database. Such an stared at the screen. The molecular structure of the unknown substances is very complex like some kind of organic inorganic hybrid material. Organic inorganic hybridization, LinMo asked from behind the observation window. It has both the carbon chain structure of organic matter and the crystal framework of inorganic matter.</p>
<p>Sue Chansin explained such materials are rare in nature and are usually artificially synthesized for special purposes such as biompatible implant materials or highly efficient catalyst carriers. She paused for a moment. If this really broke off from the fortress, it&#x27;s probably a fragment of its outer armor or internal structure. A kind of smart material that can self-rep or interact with its environment. self-repair.</p>
<p>Leewi&#x27;s eyes lit up. It asked just a guess suit. Chian shook her head, but its structure does have that potential. The porest design can accommodate repair fluids or nano machines, and the organic parts can provide flexibility and adaptability. She continued analyzing the seawater samples.</p>
<p>The data for pH value, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient content are displayed one by one. The composition of the seawater has changed. Sue Chian pointed to the data. The pH value is 0.3 lower than normal seawater, making it more acidic. The dissolved oxygen content is abnormally low, only 40% of the normal value.</p>
<p>However, the concentrations of phosphate and nitrate are very high, 5 to 8 times the normal value. Dot. What does this mean? Lin Mo asked. This means that the aquatic environment of that sea area has been severely altered. Such Chian said, &quot;Low oxygen, high nutrient salts, and acidity are typical characteristics of a dead zone.</p>
<p>When a large number of organisms die and decompose, they consume oxygen, release nutrients, and produce acidic substances at the same time.&quot; She pulled up previously recorded biological mortality data. It matches the ecological disasters we&#x27;ve observed. But strangely, if it were just biological decomposition, nutrient concentrations shouldn&#x27;t be this high. Unless unless there is additional input, Leeway replied, the energy release process of the fortress may have simultaneously catalyzed certain chemical reactions, releasing a large amount of nutrients from the seabed sediments into the water. Or to put it more directly, it is itself releasing these substances.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo stared silently at the data. The grayish white sediment may be fragments of smart materials. The unusual hydrochemical environment suggests the input of some substance. This coupled with the energy system capable of purifying radiation further supports this. This fortress seems to be doing several contradictory things at the same time.</p>
<p>releasing energy pollution that kills organisms, but also recycling and purifying radiation, discharging substances that change water quality, but also possibly using advanced self-healing materials. Any news from the remnants of the wings of Liberty? He turned to the communicator. Chi Dudwa&#x27;s voice came through. Same as always, no movement within 40 nautical miles. But the price of that batch of crystals on the black market has dropped again.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s only a third of the market price. And a new buyer has appeared. What&#x27;s your background? I don&#x27;t know. The transaction used multiple layers of encryption and anonymous accounts, but the purchase volume was huge. They bought up all the remaining goods.</p>
<p>Payment was prompt. No haggling. Chen du duo paused. I checked the flow of funds and it eventually pointed to a few offshore accounts in the Caribbean region, but I couldn&#x27;t te find anything further down the line. Dot.</p>
<p>Where are dragon souls engineering ships? They&#x27;ve already entered the 44 nautical mile zone, going one nautical mile deeper than our submersible. They&#x27;re still moving forward, but very slowly, as if they&#x27;re probing as they go. Chin Duo Duo said they&#x27;re very cautious, releasing a sonar pulse every 5 minutes to scan the seabed topography. It seems they really want to get close to the fortress. Let them go, Lyno said.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll wait and see for now. Understood. Also, the Coral Society&#x27;s unmanned submarine lost contact at 43 nautical miles. Just like our submarine, they tried to restart communication three times, all of which failed. As expected that Linmo looked at Su Chian, continue to analyze the samples and see what else we can find.</p>
<p>Sukiank, she divided the sediment sample into three parts. One part was kept for archiving, one part was used for further chemical analysis, and a third part was prepared for a riskier experiment. I want to test its biological response, she said. What do you mean? Leeway asked. Since it has a potentially biompatible material, I want to see how it reacts to living cells that Sue Chian took out a small transparent dish from the incubator.</p>
<p>Inside were some translucent gel-like substances with tiny clusters of cells scattered throughout the gel. These are stem cells extracted from the seaweed we cultivate, placed in a culture medium that simulates seawater, she explained. I take a little bit of sediment powder, sprinkle it on the edge of the culture medium, and observe the cell migration and differentiation response. Is there any risk? Yes, such said frankly, if this material is toxic or radioactive, all these cells will die, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try. Leno thought for a few seconds and nodded.</p>
<p>take precautions and operate remotely. The experimental equipment was moved into the isolation control box. Using a robotic arm, Sue Chian carefully took out a small pinch of grayish white powder and sprinkled it on the edge of the culture dish about 5 mm away from the nearest cell cluster. Then she activated the time-lapse microscopic imaging system. The camera automatically takes a picture every 30 seconds to record the real-time changes in the cells.</p>
<p>For the first 10 minutes, nothing happened. The cell clusters remained still and showed no obvious movement. The culture medium was clear without discoloration or precipitation. 12th minute. The clump of cells closest to the powder began to show subtle changes at its edges.</p>
<p>Several cells detached from the main clump and slowly moved towards the powder. The movement was very slow, only a few micrometers per minute, but it was clearly visible under a microscope. They&#x27;re approaching on their own. Such Chian stared at the screen. 18th minute.</p>
<p>As the cells moved near the powder, their morphology began to change. The originally round cells elongated, extending pseudapodia-ike protrusions to gently touch the powder particles. Upon contact, a faint fluoresence appears on the cell surface, a sign of a change in cell membrane potential, usually indicating an excitation or stress response. But the cells did not die. Instead, they began to adhere more tightly to the surface of the powder particles as if probing.</p>
<p>25th minute, even stranger things happened. The powder particles began to lighten in color at the sightes where they adhered to the cells. They gradually changed from grayish white to translucent and finally to almost completely transparent, leaving only a very faint outline. The cells attached to it increased in size by about 20% and their internal structures appear to be more active. It&#x27;s being digested by the cells.</p>
<p>Leeway asked incredulously. It has not entirely digestion. Do Sue Chanchian zoomed in on the image. Look, the structure of the powder particles is breaking down, but the breakdown products seem to be absorbed by the cells. The cell&#x27;s R&amp;T showing any toxic reactions.</p>
<p>Instead, it as if they&#x27;ve gained extra nutrients or information. She quickly operated the instrument to monitor the cell&#x27;s metabolism in real time. Data shows that the cells that came into contact with the powder experienced a 60% increase in metabolic rate and improved energy production efficiency. The activity of several key intracellular enzymes was also significantly enhanced. This material has a promoting effect on cells.</p>
<p>Suian summarized and it seems to be able to be recognized, contacted, and then broken down and utilized by cells. This is incredible. Dot. If it&#x27;s fragments of the fortress&#x27;s outer armor, what does that mean? Linmo asked. Leeway thought for a moment.</p>
<p>This means that the fortress may have biompatibility. Its materials can not only self-repair, but also be recognized and interacted with by living organisms. It is even possible that some of its functions are achieved through interaction with biological systems. For example, for example, energy exchange, information transmission, or symbiosis. Leeway said, &quot;If its original design intention was truly preservation of civilization, then establishing some kind of symbiotic relationship with surviving organisms may be a way to achieve long-term protection.&quot; This hypothesis silenced the laboratory.</p>
<p>An ancient war fortress capable of interacting with living beings. It kills creatures within 50 nautical miles, yet uses materials that can be recognized and utilized by cells. It purifies radiation, yet it also releases substances that alter water quality. Conflicts are increasing. But perhaps behind these contradictions lies a unified logic.</p>
<p>They just haven&#x27;t found it yet. 1:00 in the afternoon, the Dragon Souls engineering ship sent back the first message. They successfully reached the 43 nautical mile mark and collected water and seabed samples. However, while attempting to continue deeper, the ship&#x27;s electronic systems began to experience intermittent malfunctions, forcing them to retreat. The samples they brought back are now being sent to the laboratory at the rear.</p>
<p>At the same time, the coral society sent a data sharing request to Mo Yuan Go through clandestine channels. They were willing to provide all previously monitored energy release data in exchange for Moong G&#x27;s preliminary analysis results on sediment samples. They knew we got the samples. Chin Duo Duo said they must have heard about our underwater drones return from the black market. We can exchange Linmo decided but only provide basic data such as chemical composition and radiation levels.</p>
<p>The results of the cell experiments will remain confidential for now. Dot clear 2:00 in the afternoon. Suian completed the second round of experiments. She experimented with different types of cells interacting with the sediment powder fish cells, crustation cells, and even cultured mamalian cells. The results are similar, but not exactly the same.</p>
<p>Marine organisms cells respond more actively to powders, resulting in higher efficiency in their breakdown and absorption. Mamalian cells can also interact, but at a much slower pace, and the metabolic boost is smaller. This material seems to have a preference for marine life, Sue Chanchchan said. Or rather, it was originally designed for the marine environment. It makes perfect sense that the fortress sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Leeway said, looking at the experimental data, Lynn Mo suddenly thought of a question. If the materials of this fortress can be used for biometric identification, what will happen to the organisms living around it that come into long-term contact with these material fragments? Such an was stunned. She slowly turned her head to look at the cells in the petri dish that had become active. They might evolve, she said softly, or be modified. Long-term exposure to this material could lead to adaptive changes in an organism s metabolism structure and even genetic information.</p>
<p>like those creatures in that sea area that can survive in a high radiation environment. Lynn Mo asked, &quot;Not only that, does Such Chan expression turn serious? If the material can really exchange information with cells, then it may carry some kind of design blueprint. After a living organism comes into contact with it, it may change in the direction preset by the blueprint.&quot; She paused for a long time. That fortress may be more than just a fortress. It may also be a bio-engineering factory.</p>
<p>Chapter 136 blueprints and flesh and blood. At 11 p.m., the lights were still on in the Mouan Pavilion Command Center. Su Chian sat at the workbench in the biology lab, her eyes fixed on the microscope&#x27;s eyepiece. She had been observing for 6 hours straight, only drinking half a cup of water and eating two compressed biscuits in between. The cells in the petri dish are changing at an accelerating rate.</p>
<p>The clump of algal stem cells that initially came into contact with the sediment powder has now almost completely broken down and absorbed those grayish white particles. The cells are three times larger than before. And their morphology has also undergone a fundamental change. No longer a standard sphere, but elongated into thin filaments intertwined and connected to each other, forming a complex network. Even more disturbing is the abnormal differentiation of the internal structure of these cells.</p>
<p>Some cells have a surge in the number of chloroplasts, turning them dark green. Some cells have abnormally developed mitochondria with metabolic activity eight times that of normal cells, and some cells have even begun to secrete a translucent mucus-like substance that slowly diffuses in a culture medium. They are differentiating. Sue Chian said into the communicator. Her voice a little dry, but the direction of differentiation is completely inconsistent with a normal developmental path of seaweed cells.</p>
<p>It asks more like they&#x27;re transforming into different functional modules according to some preset program. What program? Lin Mo&#x27;s voice came through the communicator. I don&#x27;t know. Sue Chanchian adjusted her focus but looks very organized. Look, the cells that secrete mucus are concentrated at the edge of the network like they are building a barrier.</p>
<p>High metabolic cells are located at the network nodes like energy supply stations. Cells containing chloroplasts are evenly distributed probably responsible for light energy harvesting. It is almost like the prototype of a miniature ecosystem. Dot. She paused for a moment.</p>
<p>Give them more time and resources and I doubt they could actually develop into a complete self-sustaining microbial structure. There was a few seconds of silence on the other end of the communicator. Continue to observe, Linmo said. Record all the details of the changes. Also conduct a control experiment culturing the same cells using normal seawater samples to see if similar changes occur.</p>
<p>It s already being done. Sue Chian looked at another incubator next to her. The control group is doing normally. The cells are just dividing and proliferating normally without any abnormal differentiation dot. So the changes do indeed come from those sediment powders.</p>
<p>Yes, do that. Su Chanchian took a deep breath. And I think that is not all. The powder may carry some kind of instruction information that tells the cells what to become and what to do. It asks just that our current experimental conditions are too simple and the cells can only do this much dot.</p>
<p>What if a more complex organism came into contact with this material? Such an answer immediately. She thought of the dead creatures in that sea, the mutated species that could survive under high radiation, and the strange environmental changes within 50 nautical miles of the fortress. I don&#x27;t know, she finally said, but I think Wedi better not let any living organism come into contact with this stuff for extended periods of time. At least until we figure out how it works. 1:00 in the morning, Chin Duo Duo sent some new information.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls lab has the results. His voice was exceptionally clear on the communication channel late at night. After they received the samples brought back by the engineering ship, they analyzed them overnight. Now, inside information is starting to circulate. Get to the point, Lynn and Mo said.</p>
<p>Okay, that Duo Duo organized his thoughts. First, they confirmed the radiation purification phenomenon. The radiation level in the waters 40 to 50 nautical miles around the fortress is indeed about 40% lower than normal. Moreover, this purification effect is slowly spreading outward expanding by about 0.5 nautical miles per day. Dot.</p>
<p>Secondly, they detected a high concentration of nanocale metal particles in the water sample. The main components are high melting point rare metals such as titanium, zirconium, and hapneium with particle sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nanmters and complex organic modification layers on the surface. nanometal particles. Lewi interjected. What&#x27;s the concentration? Each liter of sea water contains approximately 3 to 5 million particles.</p>
<p>Chian duo said this concentration is thousands of times higher than that of normal deep sea water. Experts at Dragon Soul speculate that these particles may have detached from the surface of a fortress material or be byproducts of its energy cycle. And the third one Linmo asked. Thirdly, biological samples. Dachshind Wu&#x27;s voice became serious.</p>
<p>In the plankton samples they collected at a distance of 43 nautical miles. They found a large number of abnormal cell structures. The chloroplast arrangement of algae was changed. The shell components of small crustations showed abnormal mineralization and even the gene expression profile of bacteria showed significant shifts. He paused for a moment.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls conclusion is that the fortress is continuously releasing some kind of bioactive factor which can alter the physiological structure and function of organisms that come into contact with it. Their biggest concern now is whether this effect will be passed up the food chain and eventually affect humans. The command center was quiet for a moment. What do they plan to do? Lin Mo asked. There is no clear action plan at the moment.</p>
<p>Chen Duo said there are internal disagreements. Some people advocate taking military action immediately to destroy or seal off the fortress before the impact expands. Others believe that we should continue to study it. After all, if we can master this technology, its value will be immeasurable. Dot.</p>
<p>What about the remnants of Wings of Liberty? Still no direct news. But a new batch of goods has appeared on the black market. This time it&#x27;s not energy crystals, but some strange biological specimens. They&#x27;re said to be mutated fish salvaged from the waters near the fortress with obvious changes in their body structure such as having grown more fins or having compound eyes. The asking price is very high, but someone has already bought them.</p>
<p>Who bought it? The buyer was anonymous and the payment method was very discreet, but the final trace of the funds pointed to several marine biological research institutions, including several peripheral laboratories of the coral society. Dot. Lyno pondered for a while. Keep an eye on it, he said. Also try to reach out to various team send a new message using their metaphorical format.</p>
<p>The blueprint is in, but where is the flesh and blood? Clear. After the communication ended, Lynmo walked to the observation window and looked at the dark sea outside. The lighthouse beams swept rhythmically across the sea in the distance, illuminating the rolling waves. Sparse stars shone in the night sky, but most were obscured by thin clouds. Shhal walked in from outside holding a document in his hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Lynn, the revision of the evacuation plan is complete. He handed over the document. Based on the new situation that the fortress may have biological impact capabilities, we have added biological protection measures. All evacuation ships are equipped with air filtration systems and water purification devices.</p>
<p>and personnel protective equipment has also been upgraded, including chemical protective suits and isolation masks. Lynamo took the document and quickly flipped through it. The contingency plan is very detailed and takes into account all possible scenarios. If the fortress releases bioactive factors, if mutated organisms attack, or if the marine ecosystem completely collapses, their corresponding countermeasures for each of them. Well done, Lynn Mo.</p>
<p>Close the file. But hopefully we won&#x27;t need these. I hope so too, Sher House said. But it&#x27;s always good to be well prepared. He paused for a moment, then continued.</p>
<p>In addition, the patrol team reported that they have spotted a small number of marine creatures behaving abnormally in the waters surrounding our base in recent days. These are mainly small fish and their swimming patterns are very unnatural. Sometimes they will remain motionless for a long time or repeatedly bump into a fixed objects. Samples have been taken and sent for testing and the results will be available tomorrow. Then Mont found it.</p>
<p>How far is it from the fortress? The nearest point is about 80 nautical miles away, far beyond its current sphere of influence, Sher House said. But we cannot rule out the possibility that some organisms are carrying active factors and migrating outwards. Strengthen monitoring. Lynn Mo said, &quot;Pay special attention to any abnormal biological behavior. If any is found, report immediately.</p>
<p>Yes. After Sherhow left, Lynn Mo returned to the control panel. He pulled up all the data he had collected over the past week and began to reanalyze it. The fragments of radiation purification phenomena, nanometal particles, bioactive factors, and programmable cell differentiation are gradually piecing together an increasingly clear picture. That fortress was likely more than just a war stronghold.</p>
<p>It is a complex multifunctional facility. It can fight, produce, purify the environment and even modify living organisms. Liebe Lin Mo connected the communication in the technical area. Yes, Leeway&#x27;s voice sounded a little tired, but very clear. If we assume that the fortress was designed to rebuild civilization after a cataclysmic event, then what functional modules do you think it should include? Lewi thought for a while.</p>
<p>First, it must have a shelter function to protect survivors. Second, it must have a production function to provide survival resources. Third, it must have environmental restoration capabilities to restore damaged ecosystems. Fourth, it must have defensive capabilities to counter external threats. Fifth, he paused for a moment, then added, it may also need biological adaptation functions to help survivors adapt to the changed environment after the disaster.</p>
<p>Biological adaptation. Then Montac repeated, &quot;Yes,&quot; Leewi continued, &quot;If the post- disaster environment undergoes fundamental changes such as increased radiation levels, abnormal climate, or ecosystem collapse, then the human body may not be able to survive in the long term. In that case, some kind of adaptive modification will be needed to allow humans to survive in the new environment. So those bioactive factors might not be weapons, but rather tools for modification, possibly.&quot; Lewwayi said, &quot;If the designer&#x27;s original intention was to protect civilization, then helping survivors adapt to the environment is a reasonable consideration. It asks just that we Dante yet understand the specific mechanism of this modification, how significant the side effects are, and whether the modified creatures are still the same as before.&quot; Dot.</p>
<p>This question hung in the air of the command center. 3:00 in the morning. Su Chanchian has made a new discovery. Lynmo, you&#x27;d better come and take a look. There was a suppressed shock in her voice.</p>
<p>Lynmo rushed to the biology lab immediately. Through the observation window, he saw Su Chian standing in front of the control panel. A microscope connected to a large screen. The screen displayed magnified images of cells. &quot;What happened?&quot; Lin Mo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; Su Chian said, pointing to a corner of the screen. That was an area at the edge of the petri dish, furthest from where the powder was initially placed. It originally contained only ordinary undifferiated al stem cells. But now those cells have also changed. Although they did not come into direct contact with the powder, they began to move toward the direction of differentiating cell networks.</p>
<p>Their morphology gradually changed and their internal structure began to reorganize. This change is spreading. Sue Chanchian pulled up the time series images. Starting from the powder placement point, the area of influence is expanding outward at a rate of about 2 mm/ hour. It is not through material diffusion, but more like information transmission.</p>
<p>The differentiated cells seem to be sending some kind of signal to the surrounding cells telling them what to do. Dot. She zoomed in on an area. The images show that the two cells are connected to each other by elongated cytoplasmic protrusions with dense vesicle transport activity at the junction. They are exchanging substances and information.</p>
<p>Sue Chian said differentiated cells transfer some of their contents to undifferiated cells inducing them to also change. This process is highly directional and organized and is by no means random dot. Lenmo stared at the screen for a long time. What will happen if this process is not interrupted? All the cells in the entire petri dish will join that network. Sue Chian said, becoming a unified multifunctional biological structure.</p>
<p>It s like the prototype of a tissue or the beginning of a simple organ dot. Can you stop? IV tried it. Dr. Sue Chian pointed to several discarded culture dishes next to her. Removing the powder, changing the culture medium, and even using drugs to inhibit cell metabolism.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t he work? Once it starts, the process can&#x27;t te stopped. It s like the cells are programmed to complete the entire differentiation process, though. She turned off the screen, turned around, and her face was somewhat pale. Lyn Mo, this is terrifying. What if the active agents released by that fortress have the same effect in a natural environment? She didn&#x27;t continue, but Lyn Mo understood what she meant.</p>
<p>If nanop particles in seawater, smart materials and sediments, or even mutated organisms themselves could transmit such modification commands, then the entire marine ecosystem could be reprogrammed. According to a blueprint set by some unknown designer, it was 4 in the morning and it was still dark. The core members of my pavilion gathered in the conference room, the atmosphere heavy. Su Chian presented all the experimental data. Lewi reported the technical analysis results.</p>
<p>Chin Duo Duo summarized the intelligence from all sides. Sherhow explained the defense preparations. After everyone had finished speaking, all eyes turned to Linmo. We face a choice, Lyn Mo said slowly. Continue to stand by and wait for the situation to develop or intervene proactively and try to influence or stop the process.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment. But whichever path we choose, we must understand that we are not facing a simple enemy nor an ordinary natural disaster. We are facing a system designed to reshape life. We don&#x27;t know who designed it. We don&#x27;t know what its ultimate goal is.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know what it will do to the world. All we know is this. If we do nothing, the initiative for change will always be in the hands of others. The meeting room was silent. On a sea outside the window, the morning light began to gradually appear.</p>
<p>A new day is about to begin and this world is quietly changing. Chapter 137. Longwave echo. After the morning meeting, Lynn Emmo stayed alone in the conference room. The coffee on the table had gone cold and several extinguished cigarette but lay in the ashtray left by sure how would smoke one or two when under pressure.</p>
<p>Outside, the sky was fully bright and sunlight streamed through the bulletproof glass, cutting a bright patch of light across the floor. Lyn Mo didn&#x27;t touch the thick analysis report. He just sat there looking at the large seam map on the wall. On the map, the location of Muan Pavilion is marked with a green triangle 120 nautical miles to the southwest. A red circle represents Awakening Fortress.</p>
<p>Scattered around it are various markers. the Dragon Soul Fleet, the Coral Society&#x27;s buoy array, the possible activity area of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, and the estimated location when Vera&#x27;s team last sent a longwave signal. These markings are connected by a dense network of dotted lines, arrows, and annotations like a spiderweb with Mayuin Pavilion sitting at its center. It wasn&#x27;t a choice made actively. It was pushed into this position.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo understood this perfectly. If he had a choice, he would continue to develop quietly, accumulate resources, and expand his advantages until no one could challenge him. But this suddenly awakened ancient fortress disrupted everything. It was like a boulder crashing into calm water, the ripples causing all the boats to rock violently. There was a gentle knock on the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Go in,&quot; Linmo said. Such Chanian pushed open the door and came in, carrying a fresh cup of hot tea. She took away the cold coffee cup, replaced it with a teacup, and then sat down opposite Lynn and Mo. Leewi is continuing to analyze various team information. She spoke first.</p>
<p>The blueprint is seen, but where will the flesh and blood come from? They should understand what we are asking when we utter this sentence. It depends on whether they&#x27;re willing to answer. Lyn Mo picked up his teacup, the steam rising onto his face. Do you think they will? Lynn Mo remained silent for a while. Vera&#x27;s team had issued a warning beforehand which means they had the information and believed it should be shared he said slowly but they used metaphors and encryption which means they didn&#x27;t te want everyone to understand it or rather they didn&#x27;t te dare to let certain people understand it dot the stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood it could be the dragon soul or some third party we danty know about dot lyno took a sip of tea information is a weapon but also a burden knowing too much is sometimes more dangerous than knowing knowing nothing.</p>
<p>D Such Chanchian lowered her head and looked at her clasp hands. I did several more experiments last night on those cellular changes, she said softly, trying to block the differentiation process using different methods. Physical isolation can slow it down, but cells will change their communication methods using secreted signaling molecules to influence remotely. Chemical inhibitors are only temporarily effective. Cells develop resistance.</p>
<p>Even she paused. Even when I kill some of the differentiating cells with radiation, the surrounding cells will proliferate rapidly to fill the gaps and then continue the differentiation process. It&#x27;s as if some kind of collective consciousness is maintaining this process so that even if the individuals are destroyed, the blueprint itself will not be destroyed. Lyno put down his teacup. You believe this was conscious? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Sue Chian raised her head, a look of confusion in her eyes. From a biological point of view, this can be explained as a phenomenon of swarm intelligence like ant colonies or be colonies. But judging from the precision and anti-inference ability we have observed is too efficient. So efficient that it does not seem to have evolved naturally. Dot.</p>
<p>What if it&#x27;s driven by active factors released from the fortress? That would be even more terrifying. Such Chanchin said that would mean that the fortress could not only modify individual organisms but also the entire biological community making them organize and operate according to a preset pattern. This is not adapting to the environment. It is rebuilding the ecosystem. Dot.</p>
<p>The meeting room fell silent for a moment. On the sea outside the window, a patrol boat was sailing back to the dock. The sound of its engine approaching from afar and then gradually fading away. If that is the case, Linmo finally said, then its designers have thought very far ahead. It is not about protecting survivors during a disaster, but about rebuilding a sustainable new world after the disaster dot.</p>
<p>But who gave him that right? Sue Chanchin asked, &quot;Who decides what the new world should look like? Who decides what forms those creatures should take? That is too arrogant. It could also be despair.&quot; Lynn Emmo said, &quot;If the old world is beyond redemption, then using forceful means to create a new world is better than complete annihilation. This is a logical choice, not a moral one.&quot; Dot. Such an Xian did not refute, but the expression on her face showed that she disagreed. Perhaps she was right.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo thought some things cannot be measured by logic alone. But in this world of survival, logic is often the only guide to survival. At 9:00 in the morning, Shin Duo Duo reported new developments. Vera&#x27;s team replied, &quot;His voice came through the communicator, visibly excited. It&#x27;s still on a long wave band, and the encryption method is the same, but this time the amount of information is much larger, so decoding will take time.&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s the content roughly?&quot; Lin Mo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only understand part of the metaphor.&quot; They mentioned, &quot;The forge is lit, the anvil is beating,&quot; meaning the fortress has been activated and is now operating autonomously. There&#x27;s also the line, &quot;The old blade is no longer a blade.&quot; The gauntlet is also sharp, which might suggest that the fortress&#x27;s weapon system actually has a dual purpose, capable of both offense and defense. But the most crucial one is the last sentence. Chi and Duodo paused for a moment, seemingly checking the records. The blueprint is not a picture, but a memory.</p>
<p>The flesh and blood are not changed, but a return to the true self. Lynn Mo repeated the sentence. The blueprint is not a blueprint, but an old memory. The flesh and blood are not being transformed, but returning to reality. What does this mean? Continue decoding and send over the complete information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo said, &quot;Understood.&quot; Also, there is something new going on with Dragon Soul. The Chindwood s tone turns serious. They brought in two large supply ships from the rear which seems to indicate they preparing for a long-term standoff. At the same time, their reconnaissance aircraft have tripled their activity frequency, covering almost all the sea areas surrounding the fortressista. What are they looking for? Uncertain, but according to inside sources, the Dragon Soul leadership is very concerned about the fortress&#x27;s biological influence capabilities.</p>
<p>They worry that the active factors will spread through ocean currents or be carried to other sea areas by migrating creatures. Some experts have already proposed establishing a buffer zone to physically seal off that area. How do you create a fire break at sea? The specific plan is unclear, but it may include deploying pollution barriers, setting up sonar arrays to drive away organisms, and even considering using deep sea bombing to create artificial trenches. Chandu Duo paused. Of course, these are all extreme plans and should not be implemented in the short term, but the fact that it has been brought up indicates that the anxiety within Dragon Soul is escalating.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo ended the communication. He walked up to the map and looked at the red area, a no-go zone. If Dragon Soul really does this, it&#x27;s tantamount to turning the entire southwest sea area into a no-go zone. Moan Pavilion&#x27;s shipping routes, fishing grounds, and resource exploration will all be affected. Even more troublesome is that once this precedent is set, any sea area exhibiting abnormal phenomena could be unilaterally blocked off in the future.</p>
<p>This is not just a technical issue, it&#x27;s a power issue. Who has the right to decide the fate of a sea area? Who has the power to divide the ocean into restricted zones? Dragon souls believe they exist because they represent order and collective interests. But Lynn Emmo doesn&#x27;t like others making decisions for him. I&#x27;ve never liked it. At 100 p.m.</p>
<p>Leewei came to find Linmo with a decoded and complete information. The information was longer than expected and it took three pages to print. Metaphors within metaphors, but the basic meaning is understandable that Leeway handed the printed document to Lin Mo. The Veritine believed that the fortress is not a war machine or at least not entirely. It is a prototype of a civilization preservation facility designed to rapidly rebuild a habitable environment after a major catastrophe.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo quickly skimmed through the text. According to Vera&#x27;s team, this facility cenamed Ark is part of a great evacuation plan of a lost civilization. This civilization foresaw a catastrophic catastrophe on its home planet and thus built multiple such facilities distributed across various key ecological zones around the world. Each facility contains the civilization&#x27;s technology database gene pool and environmental modification system. After a disaster, the facility automatically activates, beginning to repair the surrounding environment, modify local organisms, and rebuild a new habitable ecosystem for the survivors.</p>
<p>The transformation is not random but carried out according to a preset ecological template. Do leeway pointed to one section. These templates are based on the civilization s research on the ideal ecological environment and are said to integrate the advantages of multiple species aiming to create a more adaptable and stable ecosystem. So those active factors are executing a template program. Lynn Emmo asked.</p>
<p>Yes, but the problem is Leeway turned to the next page that according to the incomplete records obtained by Varess team, disagreements arose within the civilization during the later stages of the construction of these facilities. Some believe that the world should be completely reconstructed according to the template while others believe that more space should be reserved for natural evolution. The final design was a compromise which may have left many ambiguities. What&#x27;s the meaning? This means that the core program of the facility may not be completely stable or there may be undiscovered vulnerabilities. Leewi said what&#x27;s more troublesome is that the resonance activation method used by the remnants of Wings of Liberty is an irregular method pieced together by the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood from damaged records.</p>
<p>They may have only activated part of the function but damaged the integrity of the system. Lin Mo continued reading. In the final part of the message, Vera&#x27;s team gave their assessment. The fortress is currently in a semi-autonomous state. Basic maintenance procedures are running, but the advanced decision-making module may be damaged or missing.</p>
<p>It is still performing environmental modification tasks, but may not be able to correctly determine the boundaries and priorities of the modifications. It&#x27;s like a self-driving car. The navigation system is broken, but the accelerator and steering will still work. Leeway explained. It knows to move forward, but it doesn&#x27;t know where to go or how to avoid obstacles.</p>
<p>Can the remnants of Wings of Liberty control it? It might be possible in the short term because they provide the initial instructions, but in the long term, Leeway shook his head. As the system as autonomy increases, control may shift. After all, by design, these facilities should ultimately be taken over by qualified administrators, not temporary activators. What qualifications are required for an administrator? The information didn&#x27;t go into details, but it mentioned genetic authentication and knowledge inheritance. It&#x27;s possible that only descendants of that civilization where those who have mastered specific technologies can fully take over.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo put down the printed document and walked to the window. Outside the window, the Muen Pavilion base was in operation. Ships were loading and unloading cargo at the dock. Workers were feeding animals in the aquaculture area, and patrol boats left white trails on the distant sea. Everything seemed orderly and stable.</p>
<p>But if the fortress in the southwest really gets out of control, if its area of modification continues to expand, and if Dragon Soul takes extreme blockade measures, all of this could be disrupted. Where is Vera&#x27;s team now? Lyn Mo asked. The message didn&#x27;t he say, but the longwave signal source was located in the southeast about 200 nautical miles away from us close to the deep sea trench area. Leewi said they may be hiding in some secret base. Can we get in touch? Can we speak directly? It&#x27;s difficult.</p>
<p>They only use longwave broadcasting and don&#x27;t accept point-to-point communication. It may be for security reasons or it may be due to equipment limitations. Then Montac nodded. He needed more information, but his access to it was limited. Vera&#x27;s team possessed crucial knowledge, but were unwilling or unable to communicate directly.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul had the capability to act, but its thinking was too militaristic. The Coral Society was only concerned with research. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood remained silent. Wings of Liberty were trapped in their fortress. Moan Pavilion is stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>At 3 p.m., Sherhow brought the patrol team&#x27;s test report. The analysis results of the abnormal biological samples are in. He placed the report on the table. They&#x27;re indeed physiological structural changes. Fish gills have developed additional filtration structures.</p>
<p>Crustaceians have abnormally hardened shell components and some plankton have even shown polyloy mutations. Are there any traces of active ingredients? Yes. Trace amounts of nanometal particles were detected in the tissue samples consistent with the composition reported by Dragon Soul, Sher House said. However, these organisms were captured 80 nautical miles away, far exceeding the current influence range of the fortress. This indicates that the active factors are either spreading faster than we thought, or there are other transmission routes.</p>
<p>For example, ocean currents, migratory organisms, and even atmospheric deposition. Shouse said, &quot;If nano particles are small enough, they could be carried by the wind to very distant places.&quot; Dot. Lyno rubbed his temples. The situation is getting complicated at a pace he doesn&#x27;t quite like. We will strengthen biological monitoring in our surrounding areas, he said.</p>
<p>We will pay special attention to aquaculture areas and fish farms. Any abnormalities will be reported immediately. Dot it already underway. Sure. How replied.</p>
<p>In addition, I suggest activating the level two emergency response plan. All ships entering and leaving the area should undergo additional disinfection procedures. Personnel must be thoroughly cleaned after contact with seawater and food and water sources should be tested more frequently. Dot. Agreed.</p>
<p>Go and make the arrangements. After sure how left, Lin Mo looked at the map again. He looked at the red area, at the various color markers around it, and at the spiderweb like lines connecting them. Then he picked up a pen and drew a circle around the location of Muan Pavilion on the map. It&#x27;s not a defensive circle.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a circle of influence. If we can&#x27;t te stop change, he muttered to himself. Then at least we should learn to control the direction of change. The sky outside the window is starting to darken again. Night is coming, but beneath the surface, change continues.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 138. Testing in the fog. The sea fog rolled in from the southwest at 4 in the morning. It wasn&#x27;t naturally formed sea fog. Meteorological monitoring data showed that the water temperature, air temperature, and humidity in that area did not meet the conditions for fog formation.</p>
<p>But the fog still came, grayish white, clinging to the sea surface, spreading slowly and steadily. The Mo Yuan Pavilion&#x27;s early warning radar was the first to detect the anomaly. The fog&#x27;s boundaries were too neat, and its movement was unnaturally uniform, as if an invisible hand was pushing it. When Lin Mo was awakened by the duty officer, the leading edge of the fog, had already reached the 70 nautical mile mark. Monitoring footage showed that the grayish white fog, like a living thing, spread across the sea surface, swallowing everything in its path.</p>
<p>Visibility rapidly dropped to less than 50 m. &quot;Radiation level?&quot; Lin Mo asked as he put on his coat. Normal, no abnormal increase. Do we s voice came through the communicator, but other parameters have changed. The magnetic field fluctuation amplitude in the fog area has increased three-fold and the concentration of charged particles in the air has increased significantly.</p>
<p>Also, sonar detection shows a large number of virtual images at the edge of the fog area as if it has been interfered with by something dot. What about biological reactions? We are monitoring it. However, the fog is too thick and the optical equipment is basically ineffective. We are mainly relying on acoustic and infrared sensors. When Lynn and Mo enter the command center, a real-time situation map was already displayed on a large screen.</p>
<p>The gray shadows representing the fog area were slowly expanding on the map like a drop of ink spreading in water. Sure, how and Chandu Duo had already arrived. Su Chian rushed over from the biological monitoring area holding the data she had just printed. The chemical composition of the fog is in the analysis that she handed the report to Lynn Emmo. The water vapor content is normal, but it contains trace amounts of nanometal particles consistent with the components detected in the seawater around the fortress.</p>
<p>There are also several unknown organic molecules with very complex structures. There are no matching entries in the database. active factor. Linmo asked possibly, but we don&#x27;t have live sample exposure tests, so we can&#x27;t be sure. Such Chian said, &quot;For safety reasons, I&#x27;ve ordered all ventilation systems to be shut down and internal circulation filtration to be activated.</p>
<p>I advise everyone to stay home for the time being, and those who must go out should wear protective equipment.&quot; Sure. How then reported, &quot;The entire patrol team has been recalled. The number of personnel at the dock and outer outposts has been doubled and all have been issued gas masks and protective suits. Ships are temporarily suspended pending further instructions. Chi and Dwa&#x27;s intelligence came a little later, but it was more comprehensive.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul has also detected the sea fog. Their fleet has retreated to the edge of the fog area and is deploying drones to attempt reconnaissance through the fog. Half of the Coral Society&#x27;s buoy array is inside the fog area. Communication is currently normal, but there is a lot of noise in the transmitted data. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is still silent.</p>
<p>He paused. In addition, a new piece of intelligence has just appeared on the black market. Someone claims that before the fog formed, they saw a band of light rising from the sea in the direction of the fortress. And then the band of light dispersed and the fog came. The price is very high, but no one has confirmed it yet.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo stared at the gray area on the screen. light bands, folk nano particles. There should be a connection between these things. How fast is the fog moving? He asked. Currently, it is moving at an average speed of 3 nautical miles hour, but its direction has changed.</p>
<p>Do leeway pulled up the trajectory map. Initially, it was heading due east, but an hour ago, it started to veer north, and now it is moving roughly northeast. If it maintains this direction and speed, it is expected to reach the outer perimeter of our base in 8 hours. thought 8 hours. Time is not tight, but it&#x27;s not ample either.</p>
<p>How thick is the fog? Lynn Emmo asked again. It has a vertical height of about 30 to 50 m, only close to the sea surface and does not extend upwards, but its horizontal range is very large, currently covering a circular area with a diameter of about 40 nautical miles, and it is still expanding. Is the fortress in the center of the fog? Yes, according to the last clear satellite image, the fog did indeed begin to spread from the fortress, but it is still unclear whether it was actively released by the fortress or influenced by some natural phenomenon. The command center fell silent. Everyone looked at Lynn Mo, awaiting his decision.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo walked to the control panel and brought up the base&#x27;s defense deployment map. Green icons represented friendly units, red represented potential threats, and gray represented unknowns. Now, a huge gray mass is pressing in from the southwest. Activate level three alert. He finally spoke.</p>
<p>Suspend all non-essential activities. Production and aquaculture areas are ready to relocate at any time. Sure. How? Set up a second perimeter 5 nautical miles from a base. If anything unidentified approaches, issue a warning first, then take action.</p>
<p>Clear leeway. Mobilize all available monitoring equipment and establish an observation network at the edge of the fog zone. I need to know the real-time changes in the fog, its composition, and whether there is anything else inside. We already working on it, but our existing equipment has limited FOD penetrating capabilities. Then let us use the simplest method.</p>
<p>Linmo said, &quot;Deploy buoys, set up a sensor array and use wire transmission. The longer the cable, the longer the monitoring will extend.&quot; The cost will be very high and we may not be able to recoup the cost of the equipment. Equipment can be rebuilt, but information cannot be discarded. Lynn Mo turned to Chanduo. Contact our insider at Dragon Soul and exchange intelligence.</p>
<p>We are willing to exchange any discoveries they make for real-time data from the edge of the fog zone, especially the results of drones penetrating the fog. Okay. What about the Coral Academy? Contact them as well. Tell them we can provide fog composition analysis data in exchange for their buoy array historical records. I need to know what happened in that area before the fog formed.</p>
<p>Orders were issued one after another and the command center became busy again. Suchen did not leave. She stood beside Lyno, watching the constantly changing gray area on the screen. What do you think this is? She asked softly. Test Lyno said her probe.</p>
<p>Dot. What are you testing? Testing the environment s reaction. Testing the organism&#x27;s reaction. Testing our reaction. Lin Mo pointed to the fog diffusion trajectory.</p>
<p>You see it as not spreading aimlessly. The direction is adjusted and the speed is controlled. It asked more like conducting some kind of systematic scan using fog as a medium to collect information. What information are you collecting? Lynmo did not answer immediately. He recalled a line from Vera&#x27;s team message.</p>
<p>The blueprint is not a picture but a memory. If that fortress is indeed rebuilding its environment based on some kind of old memory, then it first needs to know what the current environment looks like. It needs to know where the creatures are, where the resources are, and where the threats are. fog may be its eyes and ears. At 7:00 in the morning, it got light, but visibility in the foggy area did not improve.</p>
<p>Leeway&#x27;s monitoring network transmitted back the first batch of data. The composition of the fog was changing the closer to the center, the higher the concentration of nano particles and the more types of unknown organic molecules. The intensity of magnetic field interference increased with depth. After entering the fog zone five nautical miles, wireless communication was essentially unusable. We deployed three buoys, but only the shallowest one is still transmitting signals.</p>
<p>Leeway reported the other two lost contact after going 8 nautical miles. The last data before they lost contact showed that the concentration of nano particles underwater was 10 times that of the surface die. What about living things? A large number of plankton died at the edge of the fog zone. Fish exhibited abnormal behavior. Some swam frantically while others remained completely still.</p>
<p>Even stranger, the traps we set three nautical miles away caught several species that should have been in the deep sea. They seem to have been driven up from the depths by something dot. Such an pulled up images of those deep sea species. Several hagfish, several giant isopods, and a rare deep sea dragon fish. These creatures usually live hundreds of meters below sea level, but now they were appearing in shallow water.</p>
<p>Were their physiological indicators? The stress response was extremely strong. The heart rate was two to three times the normal value and the concentration of stress hormones in the blood was extremely high, but strangely there was no obvious physical damage nor any indication of the invasion of active factors. It&#x27;s like they were scared, Sher House said. or they were forced into it, Lyn Mo added. He looked towards the center of the fog.</p>
<p>There the ancient fortress lay silently on the seabed. The fog it released was altering the ecology of the entire sea area. At 9:00 in the morning, Chi and Duodo brought information about the exchange of dragon souls. Their drones failed to penetrate the fog. Chi and Duo Duo said all three medium-sized drones lost contact 10 nautical miles after entering the fog area.</p>
<p>Images transmitted before the loss of contact showed abnormal optical refraction phenomena inside the fog and the drone&#x27;s own navigation systems experienced serious positioning errors. They think it&#x27;s electronic interference. More than that, Dragon Souls technicians suspect that the nano particles in the fog may have formed some kind of distributed antenna array that can actively interfere with electromagnetic waves in specific frequency bands. Moreover, the interference mode is very intelligent and will dynamically adjust according to the signal characteristics of the target. Are our buoys still working? It&#x27;s still there, but the transmission rate has dropped by 70%.</p>
<p>Leeway said it might be because we&#x27;re using wire transmission and the signal modulation method is relatively old, no longer interfering with key frequency bands. Being old can sometimes be a disadvantage and sometimes it can be an advantage. What about the Coral Society? They were happy to exchange data. Chand Duo Duo pulled up a document. This is all the records of their buoy array in the 12 hours before the fog formed.</p>
<p>The data shows that in the 6 hours before the fog formed, the microbial community in the waters around the fortress underwent drastic changes. The number of a certain metal-loving bacteria increased by thousands of times in 4 hours and then suddenly all of them died. After the death, the concentration of nano particles in the water began to rise. Is the death of bacteria a cause or consequence? The Coral Society believes this is the cause? They speculate that the fortress activated some mechanism that induced bacteria to proliferate and accumulate metal elements, then killed the bacteria and extracted nanoparticle raw materials from them. These particles were then released into the atmosphere, forming fog.</p>
<p>Using bacteria as a production line and seawater as raw material, it produces what it needs. Very efficient. Lynn Emmo commented, &quot;It is also terrifying.&quot; Such Chian said, &quot;If it can manipulate microorganisms at will, then the entire ecological balance of the ocean is under its control. Today, it can create fog. Tomorrow, it can create toxic alba blooms or something even worse.&quot; At 11:00 a.m., the edge of the fog zone was still 40 nautical miles from the Mayuan Pavilion base.</p>
<p>But a new problem has arisen. The monitoring network detected unusual water movement on the northeastern edge of the fog covered area. A strong upwelling carrying large amounts of nutrients and cold seawater surged from a depth of 200 m. Upwelling itself is not uncommon, but its location and scale are rare. is right in front of the expanding fog area as if clearing the way for the fog to arrive.</p>
<p>Upwelling changes water temperature, salinity, and nutrient composition, Sue Chanchan said looking at the data. This disperses the existing planktonic community, creating space for new communities. If the nano particles and active factors brought by the fog require specific environmental conditions to function, then upwelling is preparing a petition dish. We are systematically transforming the environment, Leeway concluded. Moreover, the steps are very clear, Linmo said.</p>
<p>First, change the water chemistry, then release the modification factor, and finally use fog as a transmission medium and cover. Each step is interconnected. He walked up to the map and looked at the everexpanding gray area. He is now almost certain that this is neither a coincidence nor a system malfunction. This is a purposeful and systematic action.</p>
<p>That fortress is reshaping the sea area according to the blueprint it remembers. The question is where will it stop? At noon, Sher House sent back an emergency report from the outer perimeter cordon. Mr. Lynn, ships have appeared at the edge of the fog zone that his voice was somewhat tense. They are not from Dragon Soul, nor from any known force.</p>
<p>Three small speedboats emerging from the fog. No markings, no communication response, and they are heading northeast. Uh, intercept them. Linmo ordered immediately, but maintain distance and do not enter the fog zone. Understood.</p>
<p>Two patrol boats have been dispatched. Intercept them, and contact is expected in 15 minutes. The atmosphere in the command center suddenly became tense. A ship emerging from the fog. Who is it? A remnant of the Wings of Liberty or something else entirely? 15 minutes felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>Lynn and Mo stared at the clock, counting each second very clearly. At 12:08, Sherhow reported again, visually confirmed. There are three modified assault boats. Each boat carries three to four people, all wearing full protective suits and masks. The hulls show obvious signs of modification with additional antennas and equipment boxes installed.</p>
<p>Is there hostility? Not yet. They slowed down after spotting our patrol boat, but didn&#x27;t turn. One of them raised a white flag. Raise a white flag. These days, the standard procedure for encounters at sea is to communicate first, then approach.</p>
<p>Raising a white flag directly is either an extreme sign of weakness or a trap. Maintain vigilance. Allow them to approach to a safe distance, but do not allow them to board the ship. Lyno said, &quot;Have them send a representative over in a small boat. Only one person clear.</p>
<p>At 12:16, a small boat was lowered from the assault boat carrying one person and slowly sailed toward the patrol boat of Mayuan Pavilion. Through the remote monitoring footage, Lin Mo saw the person. Medium build, wearing a gray protective suit, the face mask obscuring the view. The movements were steady without any unnecessary actions. After the small boat pulled alongside the patrol boat, the man raised his hands to indicate that he was unarmed.</p>
<p>Sherhow&#x27;s men quickly searched him and after confirming his safety, led him into the patrol boat&#x27;s cabin. Sherhow&#x27;s voice came through the communicator. The man has boarded the ship. He said he wants to see you, saying there&#x27;s important intelligence to exchange. He won&#x27;t reveal his identity, but he gave you this.</p>
<p>The scene shifts and Sherhow&#x27;s hand appears in front of the camera holding a metal badge. The badge is circular with intricate etched patterns on its surface and at its center is a geometric design. Three intersecting rings each with fine engravings inside. Lin Mo didn&#x27;t recognize the pattern, but Chin Duo Duo gasped in shock on the communication channel. That s an internal token of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, he said.</p>
<p>Only members of level three or higher have it. The details of the pattern represent the branch and level of authority. I&#x27;ve seen this pattern once before. It is the symbol of the deep divers group. They are an elite group within the brotherhood specifically responsible for exploring deep sea ruins.</p>
<p>The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood emerging from the fog. Haven&#x27;t they fallen silent? Shouldn&#x27;t they distance themselves from wings of freedom? Bring him over, Lyno said. Use an isolation pod and monitor him the whole time. Notify Su Xian to prepare for biological testing and Leeway to prepare for technical scanning. I need to know if he&#x27;s carrying any souvenirs.</p>
<p>Clear. Communication ended. Lyn and Mo looked at the close-up of the badge on the screen. Three intersecting rings. The deep diver group.</p>
<p>Things seemed to be taking an unexpected turn. The fog was still slowly advancing over the sea outside the window. Gray, silent, unfathomable. The person emerging from the fog brought new variables. Chapter 139.</p>
<p>Words of the deep ones. The isolation chamber located on the east side of the Muan Pavilion base is an independent prefabricated unit. The walls are made of double- layered alloy plates sandwiching a lead core capable of shielding most radiation and signals. It has an independent ventilation system with the air filtered through three stages. Behind the one-way observation window is the monitoring room where Lynn Mo, Sue Chanchian, and Leewi are currently standing.</p>
<p>The man who called himself the deep diver sat on a metal chair inside the isolation pod. He had removed his protective suit and put on a gray bodysuit. His mask was also gone, revealing a face that appeared to be around 40 years old. His cheeks were thin, his eyes were sunken, and he had stubble on his chin. The most striking feature was an old scar on his left eyebrow, fainting color, but still visible.</p>
<p>Sure how he stood two steps behind him, maintaining a vigilant stance. Two fully armed guards stood watch by the door. Name? Lyno said through the communicator. His voice had been processed and was unrecognizable. You can call me Shadowbringer.</p>
<p>The man-s voice was a little horsearo, but steady. The name doesn&#x27;t matter. Already know my identity. Dot. He pointed to the badge on the table beside him.</p>
<p>The badge had been carefully examined and confirmed to be genuine from the Stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood and of a high level of authority. Why did you come out of fog? Lyn Emmo asked. Because it s relatively safe in the fog for now, Chenning said dragon soul s drones dant dare to go in. Your patrol boats dant dare to go in and even the fish in the sea are fleeing. For those who want to operate discreetly, it s a good passage.</p>
<p>Where are you going? I was originally heading southeast to find Vera&#x27;s team. The shadow said frankly, but the fog&#x27;s direction of spread has changed and my ship can outrun it. Seeing your patrol boat, I thought maybe we can make a deal. What deal? Chinning didn&#x27;t answer immediately. He looked around, his gaze lingering on the observation window for a second before returning to the table.</p>
<p>I need a safe base to stay in for 48 hours. In exchange, I could provide more information about that fortress than you currently know. more than Dragon Soul knows and possibly more than Various team dot. What makes you think we need your intelligence? Because you sent a submarine in and managed to recover one alive. The shadowy figure looked towards the observation window, though it couldn&#x27;t see the people behind it.</p>
<p>Because you conducted cell experiments and discovered that the materials could be biodegraded and utilized because you monitored the changes in the fog composition and knew that it wasn&#x27;t a natural phenomenon. He paused for a moment. It&#x27;s also because you sent a message to Vera&#x27;s team asking, &quot;The blueprint is in sight, but where is the flesh and blood?&quot; This shows that you&#x27;ve touched the edge of the problem, but haven&#x27;t seen the whole picture yet. The monitoring room was silent for a few seconds. This person knows too much.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a member of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. How do you know about our research progress?&quot; Such Chanchin asked. The Brotherhood s intelligence network is wider than you think, Shadow said. Moreover, we are interested in anything that happens around the fortress. When your submersible returned, our people were in the nearby waters.</p>
<p>We also keep an eye on the supplies coming in and out of your base. This is directed at you. It is just a professional habit. Then why betray the brotherhood now? Linmo asked. Chinning gave a rice smile.</p>
<p>It is not betrayal. It is a disagreement. He corrected. The brotherhood is divided on the fortress. The conservatives believe that all contact should be severed immediately, all related data destroyed, and the thing put to rest forever.</p>
<p>The radicals, mainly a part of the deep ones, believe this is a once- ina-lifetime opportunity, and that we should acquire its technology at all costs. Which faction are you from? Me? Shadow shook his head. I belong to the third faction, the minority. I think the fortress is untouchable but it can&#x27;t te be ignored either because it has awakened and is operating according to its own program whether we like it or not it will change everything around us what we need to do is not to control it but to understand it and then find a way to coexist with it dot coexistence Leewi&#x27;s tone was skeptical existence Chining said seriously you think it s a war machine but it s not or at least not entirely it s an ecological ical reconstruction facility designed to quickly restore the environment after a major catastrophe and create living space for survivors. The problem is that the catastrophe and environment it was designed for may be completely different from our world now.</p>
<p>Dot. He leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees. For example, if its program believes that the appropriate seawater temperature is 25° C, but it is currently 20° C, it will try to raise the water temperature to 25°. If it believes that the appropriate biological community is a certain type of coral fish symbiotic system, but it is currently another type, it will modify the existing organisms to make them the way the program wants them to be. Regardless of whether the existing ecosystem can withstand this change, Such Chenin asked in its logic, the existing ecosystem itself is damaged and needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>Chennying said it has no malicious intent. It has just carrying out its mission. It asks like a gardener walking into a wilderness and seeing weeds growing everywhere. He will pull out the weeds and plant roses according to his own blueprint for the garden. He once tked if the weeds want to be pulled out.</p>
<p>This analogy silenced everyone in the monitoring room. What&#x27;s the current situation with the remnants of Wings of Liberty? Lyn Mo asked a different question. They read trapped inside. Chining said the resonance activation did give them initial control, but it was very crude control like using a master key to start a nuclear power plant. They can open doors and press a few buttons, but they dye understand the system as principles at all, let alone operate it precisely.</p>
<p>Can they come out now? They can, but they dare not. Chinyanging said the Fortresses S defense system designates a 40 nautical mile warning zone around it. Any unidentified target that approaches will be met with a warning attack. The wings of Freedom have identification codes and can enter and leave safely, but once they leave, they lose the opportunity for direct control, so they can only come out in shifts using small speedboats and operate under the cover of fog dot. Are they the ones selling the goods on the black market? Part of it.</p>
<p>The Fortress S production line is still running, capable of manufacturing energy crystals and some basic materials. They use these to trade for food, medicine, and radiation protection equipment. The shadow paused. You should have already discovered that the environment inside the fortress is not friendly. Long-term exposure to that energy field is very damaging to the human body.</p>
<p>Dot. Such Chanchian recalled the changes in the experimental cells. &quot;What if human cells were also exposed to the active factors? Have the people inside shown any changes in their physical condition?&quot; she asked. Chenning&#x27;s expression turned serious. &quot;Yes, but I don&#x27;t know the specifics of the changes.&quot; Several Deep One colleagues I know joined the Wings of Freedom, and during our last communication, their voices sounded strange.</p>
<p>Not the kind of weakness that comes from illness, but something else like there was an echo or a delay. When I asked them about their health, they all avoided the topic. The atmosphere in the monitoring room grew even more tense. What is your real purpose in coming here? Lynn Mo returned to the original question. Hidden Shadow took a deep breath.</p>
<p>I want to work with you to find the administrator agreement. This word made everyone pause for a moment. Administrator agreement. The highest level of control over the fortress design. Chining explained the activator is only a temporary operator.</p>
<p>The rail control belongs to the administrator. Administrators need specific genetic certification or to possess specific knowledge keys. Whoever obtains administrator privileges can completely control the fortress, stopping or adjusting its operating procedures. Do you know how to get it? I don&#x27;t know everything, but I know the direction. Chennying said, &quot;Vera s team may have some clues, but they are unwilling or afraid to share them.</p>
<p>I need a safe place to organize the information I have and try to establish reliable contact with them. This place seems to be the most suitable place right now.&quot; Dot. He looked toward the observation window. You have research capabilities, defensive capabilities, and most importantly, you are not completely controlled by any one party. Dragon soul is too bureaucratic.</p>
<p>The Brotherhood is internally divided. The coral society only cares about science and the wings of liberty are half mad. Only you can still look at the problem calmly. Dot. This is both a compliment and the truth.</p>
<p>Then mo pondered. Accepting this person meant accepting risks. The stonemason&#x27;s brotherhood might view this as hostile. The wings of freedom might see the ink abyss pavilion as a new target and the dragon soul would pay even closer attention to this place. But if they don&#x27;t accept it, they might miss crucial information.</p>
<p>Clues about the administrator&#x27;s agreement and the true purpose of the fortress might be hidden in the materials brought by the shadow. Where is your file? Lynmo asked. On my ship in an encrypted storage device. It requires both my biometrics and password verification to open. Chining said I can hand the device over to you for inspection, but you need to promise not to copy, distribute, or leak it before confirming the contents.</p>
<p>Why should we believe that the information you provide is true? You can verify some of them first. Chinying said, for example, the prediction about the fortresses energy cycle. According to my data, the next deep breath will begin in 72 hours, last for about 4 hours, and its radius of influence will be 20% larger than this one. You can wait until then and see how accurate the prediction is. Dot leeway immediately began calculating.</p>
<p>The last time he took a deep breath was 3 days ago, and the cycle was indeed about 72 hours. A 20% increase in the radius of influence meant that the fog zone could extend to 50 nautical miles away. If the prediction is accurate, it means that the data from the latent image is indeed valuable. We need to discuss this. Lynn Mo said, &quot;You rest here for now.</p>
<p>Food and water will be brought in through the pass through window. Dante try to leave and Dante try to communicate.&quot; Dot. I understand. Dot. Shinning nodded.</p>
<p>Also, I suggest you check the three ships I brought. There might be something attached to their surfaces. When I came out of the fog, I noticed some nano particles gathered on the halls. Do Sue Chian immediately looked at the surveillance footage outside the isolation ward. The three assault boats were docked at the dedicated pier and a cordon had been set up around them.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;Not sure, but it as best to clean them up,&quot; Shadow said. The Fortress s perception system might be tracking targets through these particles. I&#x27;m not sure if it will take further action against the intruders. Lynn Mo ended the call.</p>
<p>In a monitoring room, the three people looked at each other in bewilderment. Is it believable? Lewisian asked partially credible. Such Chian said he was right about the cell experiments and the analysis of the fog components. It would be difficult to know such detailed information without internal channels. It could also be bait deliberately laid out by the Brotherhood, Leewi warned.</p>
<p>Possibly, Lin Mo admitted, but the clue about the administrator agreement is worth a risk. If we can really gain control of the fortress, he didn&#x27;t finish his sentence, but everyone understood what it meant. An ancient facility capable of transforming the environment, producing resources, and potentially even restoring the ecosystem. If Mo Yuan Pavilion could control it, it would gain unimaginable advantages. But the risks are equally enormous.</p>
<p>Inspect a ship first. Lynn MMO decided Sue Chian, you take the biology team there and make sure they have the highest level of protection. Leeway, you analyze the prediction data he provided and build a verification model. I&#x27;ll contact Chin Duo Duo and have him investigate the true identity of this shadow within the brotherhood. If he really came for help, should we take him in? Su Chanchin asked.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo looked at the man in the isolation pod. He was sitting quietly staring at the ceiling, his fingers unconsciously tapping lightly on his knees. Let&#x27;s wait for the verification results, Lynn Mo said. Until then, remain vigilant. Tell sure how to increase patrols around the base, especially in a foggy area.</p>
<p>Report any unusual activity immediately. After the order was given, everyone began to take action. Lynn and Mo stayed in the monitoring room and observed chinnying for a while longer. This man possessed a contradictory quality, both weary and alert, both frank and reserved. He said a lot, but there was certainly much more he didn&#x27;t say.</p>
<p>For example, why did he leave the fraternity? How much information did he actually possess? And what did he plan to do after finding the administrator agreement? The sky outside the window gradually darkened. The fog over the sea was still slowly but steadily advancing northeastward, gray, silent, unfathomable. Were the people brought in from the fog allies or the beginning of another trouble? Lynamote didn&#x27;t know, but he knew one thing. The peaceful days in this sea were long gone. Chapter 140.</p>
<p>The messenger in the fog. At 5:00 in the morning, the fog stopped advancing. It didn&#x27;t dissipate, but rather remain still like the tide after it has reached its highest point. Monitoring footage showed the grayish white fog wall hovering 35 nautical miles from the Mo Yuan Pavilion base. Its edges so neat they looked as if drawn with a ruler.</p>
<p>Within the fog zone, visibility remained zero. Outside the fog zone, the morning light began to illuminate the sea. Leeway stared at the data screen, his fingers rapidly tapping on the keyboard. He was verifying Chinnying&#x27;s second prediction regarding the fog spread radius. According to the formula provided by Chennying combined with the intensity of the first wave of energy released by the fortress and local hydraological data, the maximum radius of influence of the fog was theoretically 52 nautical miles.</p>
<p>The actual measured value is now 51.5 nautical miles. The error is less than 1%. Either his formula is true or his team did extremely precise preliminary observations, Leeway told Lyno. But either way, it shows that they have more information than we thought. Dot.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo stood in front of the observation window, watching the sky slowly brighten outside. Inside the isolation pod, Chi Ining was still asleep in a relaxed posture, seemingly completely unconcerned about his situation. Perhaps he was very confident. &quot;What are the results of the whole inspection?&quot; Linmo asked. Su Chian pushed open the door and came in holding the test report in her hand.</p>
<p>Her face showing a mixture of confusion and vigilance. It has very troublesome dot. She placed the report on the table. We scan the entire hull of those three assault boats. The surface is covered with a layer of nano particles with an average thickness of only a few micrometers, but the distribution is extremely uneven.</p>
<p>Dot. She pulled up the scanned image. The screen displayed a three-dimensional model of the hull with different colors representing different particle densities. It was clear that the particles formed several distinct clusters at the stern and on both sides of the hole with very regular shapes all elongated or net-like. What is even stranger is the structure that Sue Chian zoomed in on an area.</p>
<p>These particles aren&#x27;t t randomly attached. They reconnected. Look here. The particles are arranged in chains and there are cross connections between the chains forming a kind of neural network like structure. Duh.</p>
<p>A neural network. Leeway leaned closer to look. You mean these particles are self-organizing? It looks like it. Sue Chanchian pointed to the details in the image. Moreover, the structural complexity varies in different clusters.</p>
<p>The stern is the most complex with three levels of branches. The hull is simpler with only the main trunk and onele branches. It looks like it s growing the growth requires energy. These particles may extract energy from ship hole materials or seawater. Such anchin said.</p>
<p>Our sampling analysis revealed a weak electrochemical gradient inside the particles. Although very weak, it does exist. Lenmo stared at the images. Grayish white nano particles adhered to the ship&#x27;s hull in the sea fog, then began to self-organize, forming neurallike structures. &quot;It sounded like science fiction, but the test report was right before his eyes.&quot; &quot;What functions does it have?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear yet,&quot; Sue Chanchan said. &quot;But Wee, he done a few experiments. We found that these structures are very sensitive to changes in electromagnetic fields. When a weak electric field is applied, the structures rearrange themselves. When a sound wave of a specific frequency is applied, some connections break and some are strengthened.</p>
<p>Sensing capabilities or communication capabilities, Leeway interjected. If these particles could sense changes in the environment and then transmit the information in some way dot report back to the fortress, Lynn Mo continued the room fell silent. If this is true, then fog is not just altering the environment but also establishing a monitoring network. Each nanop particle is a miniature sensor and each chain-like structure is a data line. The entire foggy area is a vast distributed sensing system.</p>
<p>No wonder Dragon Souls drones lost contact as soon as they entered. They weren&#x27;t interfered with. They were completely seen through. Has it been cleaned up? Lynn Mo asked. It&#x27;s difficult.</p>
<p>Su Chanchian shook her head. Physical wiping can only remove the surface layer. The particles have already penetrated into the micro pores of the ship&#x27;s paint. Chemical cleaning has limited effectiveness, and we dare not use strong corrosives for fear of damaging the hall. In the end, we can only use a high temperature flame to locally cauterize the area, but this will damage the whole material.</p>
<p>And she paused, then added, and we&#x27;re not sure if these particles will emit some kind of signal when they&#x27;re destroyed. Notify Sher how to isolate those three ships in a separate area and set up a shield around them. Lin Mo ordered. No one is allowed to approach without my permission. Clear.</p>
<p>At 700 a.m. Chin Duo Duo brought the latest developments from all sides. Dragon Souls engineering ships have withdrawn, retreating to a safe distance of 60 nautical miles. His voice came through the communicator, but they have dispatched two submarines, both newly modified models, reportedly with enhanced anti-jamming capabilities. They are currently submerging on the outer edge of the fog zone, seemingly intending to approach from underwater.</p>
<p>What about the Coral Society? Two more of their buoy arrays have lost contact, leaving only the outermost three still transmitting data. But the institute seems even more excited, seeing this as a golden opportunity to study active environmental modification systems. One senior researcher even publicly stated that if this technology could be mastered, humans could survive in any extreme environment. Short-sighted, Such Chanian said softly, &quot;How will the Stonemason brothers react?&quot; Lin Mo asked. The inside information is very chaotic.</p>
<p>Chin duo said the conservatives are purging the radicals and several members of the deep ones have been detained or isolated. The Brotherhood s leadership has issued a new directive requiring all members to immediately cease all research related to the fortress with violators facing expulsion. But it is said that some radicals have gone underground and may even have defected to the wings of Liberty Dot. Where is the shadow&#x27;s ship? Are there any signs that it&#x27;s being tracked? Nothing has been found so far, but I retrieved the monitoring records from the edge of the fog area and found that about 20 minutes after his boat came out, several areas of increased local concentration appeared inside the fog wall, shaped like tentacles that were sticking out. However, they quickly retreated it.</p>
<p>Tentacles. This word reminded Lin Mo of the neural network structures on those ship holes. Continue monitoring, he said. Also contact our contacts within Dragon Soul and ask them for real-time submarine data. In exchange, we can provide the analysis results of the hall attachments do clear.</p>
<p>After the communication ended, Lin Mo decided to meet Shinnying one more time. Inside the isolation chamber, Shinning was already awake and doing some simple stretching exercises. He nodded to Lin Mo behind the observation window as a greeting. Your prediction was very accurate, Linmo said bluntly. Thank you, Chenning wasn&#x27;t surprised.</p>
<p>The fog stopped at 51.5 nautical miles. Your formula predicted 52 nautical miles. The error is within an acceptable range. Chennying said, &quot;There are many influencing factors, such as the sea surface wind speed last night being 0.2 two levels higher than expected and a weak warm current cutting in from the southeast. All of which may have led to a reduction in the radius.</p>
<p>He spoke so naturally as if you&#x27;re discussing the weather. How much do you know about the nano particles on the ship&#x27;s hull lin mo changed the subject. The shadowy figure paused. He turned to face the observation window. His expression becoming serious.</p>
<p>You discovered it. The structure has been discovered. Neural network like yes. Hidden Shadow took a deep breath, then I suggest you clean it up as soon as possible using a highfrequency pulse electric field combined with ultrasound of a specific frequency. I can give you the specific parameters.</p>
<p>If those structures are fully developed, the ship will become the fortress&#x27;s eyes and ears. You already know how to clean it up, so why didn&#x27;t you deal with it before you came out? Linmo asked. Because the process sends out a very strong signal, it asks like telling the fortress. There is something a miss here. Chinying said in a fog.</p>
<p>Keeping a low profile is the way to survive. Now that weary out, we can clear things out more boldly. Dot. The logic is sound. How long will it take for these structures to mature? Lynn Mo continued to ask from a moment of attachment begins.</p>
<p>It takes about 72 hours. After that, the structure will stabilize and begin transmitting data. The transmission distance depends on the particle density in the environment. In the fog zone, it can theoretically cover the entire fog area. What data is being transmitted? Everything it can sense, Chinnying said.</p>
<p>Temperature, pressure, electromagnetic fields, sound waves, even biochemical signals. If there are living people on board, it might even be able to monitor their physiological indicators. Dot. Such an stopped taking notes. How long has your ship been attached? Lynn Emmo asked.</p>
<p>It took us 7 hours and 12 minutes to go from entering through the edge of the fog to exiting. The structure is probably still in its early stages of growth. Far from mature, Chining said, but for safety, UD better clean it up now. The parameters are electric field frequency 1.2 MHz, intensity 300 volts per meter, ultrasonic frequency 40 kHz, sound pressure level 140 dibels. The duration should be at least 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Leeway immediately began to calculate the feasibility of this plan. Will a fortress know after the cleanup? Linmo asked, &quot;We might detect node loss, but we might not be able to pinpoint the exact location, especially if we are operating in a shielded environment.&quot; Chining said, &quot;It like when you pluck a hair, you know the hair is out, but you dine know where it fell.&quot; Dot. This metaphor is very apt. Linmo made a decision. Leeway, prepare the equipment according to the parameters he gave.</p>
<p>Sure. Howal. Tow the ship to the number three shielded dock and begin cleaning in 20 minutes. All personnel evacuate to a safe distance and operate remotely. The order was issued swiftly.</p>
<p>The shadowy figure watched all this from inside the isolation pod, his face expressionless. But just as Lin Mo was about to leave, he suddenly spoke. You validated the first prediction. The second prediction regarding deep breathing is 48 hours away. If that also comes true, would you be willing to consider my cooperation proposal? Linmo stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p>What suggestion? I can help you find clues about the administrator agreement and even try to gain access for you. Chining said, &quot;In exchange, I need your protection and if necessary, help me rescue a few people.&quot; Dot. Who is it? My colleagues. Several deep ones still trapped in the fortress or trapped within the brotherhood. Dot shadow s voice lowered.</p>
<p>They shouldn&#x27;t te have died there whether from mad research or from internal purges. Line looked at him. This person&#x27;s eyes were complex showing weariness, determination, and a deep-seated pain. Let&#x27;s wait until the second prediction is verified before we talk about it. Limo finally replied.</p>
<p>He left the monitoring room and headed towards the command center. The corridor was quiet with only the echo of footsteps on the metal floor. Outside the window, the morning light had fully illuminated the sea, and the distant wall of fog stretched across the horizon like a giant gray curtain, 35 nautical miles. If the fog suddenly accelerates, the distance is such that it would only take a few hours to reach the base. But according to the shadow, the fog will not advance any further.</p>
<p>The fortress&#x27;s exploration is complete. The next step is to process the data and prepare for the next deep breath. Everything proceeded according to procedure. Precise, efficient, ruthless. Lynn Mo walked to the control panel and pulled up the base&#x27;s full deployment map.</p>
<p>Green dots represented friendly units, yellow dots represented units on standby, and red dots represented units on alert. The map showed the outer patrol lines, the inner defensive perimeter, and the production facilities in the core area. This is the order he established over several months. Now, an ancient creation is establishing another order in its own way. Two orders are destined to clash.</p>
<p>The cleanup work began at 9:00 a.m. The number three shielding dock is a completely enclosed reinforced concrete structure with lead plates and copper mesh lining its inner walls capable of shielding most electromagnetic signals. Three assault boats are fixed inside and 12 sets of highfrequency electrodes and eight high power ultrasonic generators are arranged around it. Leeway operated the controls in the control room with all parameters set according to the settings provided by Chenning. electric field activated ultrasonic start.</p>
<p>The monitoring screen began to shake. The grayish white coating on the whole surface rippled like water under the influence of the two energies. The chain-like structure composed of nano particles began to break and decompose into even smaller particles which then detached from the whole surface and dispersed into the air. The cleaning process lasted 12 minutes. When it was finished, the whole surface had returned to its original color, except for some minor cracks in the paint sea traces of high temperature and soundwave impact.</p>
<p>The sampling robot enters the shielded dock to collect air and surface samples. The test results showed that the concentration of nano particles dropped to background levels. Structural features completely disappeared. Cleanup complete. Leeway reported.</p>
<p>Keep the shielded dock sealed and continue monitoring 24 hours a day, Lyno said. Report any abnormalities immediately. Clear. At 100 p.m., Chi and Duo Duo brought the latest news about the Dragon Soul submarine. They successfully dived to the 40 nautical mile mark, but couldn&#x27;t he go any further? Shiend Duodo said there&#x27;s also a boundary underwater like some kind of energy field or material barrier.</p>
<p>The submarine Sonar showed that the water density and sound speed inside the barrier were abnormal, making navigation too risky, and they were forced to return. No attempt to break through. We tried, but as soon as we made contact with the barrier, all of the submarine&#x27;s external sensors malfunctioned. The commander dared not take the risk and order retreat. The submarine is now on its way back to the mother ship.</p>
<p>What about the Coral Society? They lost their last three buoys and have now completely lost their ability to directly monitor the fog area. But the top brass of the society seems even more determined to conduct research and is urgently allocating new equipment to prepare for the establishment of a denser observation network outside the fog area. Any movement from the remnants of Wings of Liberty? No. Their supplies have been cut off on the black market. It could be that the production line has stopped or it could be that they are afraid to come out.</p>
<p>dot and duo paused. But there is another piece of news. The radical faction of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood tried to approach the fortress from the east last night, but all three ships lost contact. The conservatives have now completely taken control of the Brotherhood and are retreating across the bord. All parties are testing the waters and all are suffering losses.</p>
<p>Only Mo Yuan Pavilion, thanks to Chinys intelligence, has temporarily avoided the most direct conflict. Lynn and Mo looked in the direction of the isolation pod. Will this person bring an opportunity or the beginning of even bigger trouble? 46 hours until the second deep breath. Time is passing. Beyond a fog wall, the ocean remained calm as if nothing would happen.</p>
<p>Chapter 141. Deep breathing. For hours before the deep breathing began, the monitoring network of Mayuan Pavilion detected the first sign. It was not an energy fluctuation, nor a change in magnetic field, but sound. The deep sea microphone array recorded a low-frequency sound wave around 10 hertz, lasting about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>The sound source was located in the massive dome structure directly beneath the fortress. The soundwave form was peculiar, rising slowly at its peak, remaining stable for a period, and then slowly declining like a long sigh. Leeway&#x27;s expression was solemn when he projected the acoustic spectrum onto the main screen. This is mechanical vibration at least not the kind of mechanical vibration we usually see. He said the frequency is too stable and the waveform is too clean that it has more like a pressure regulation process in some kind of fluid system.</p>
<p>Dot. Is the dome adjusting its internal pressure? Lynn Mo asked very likely. Leeway pulled up the data from the last deep breath. Look, there was a similar sound, wave, signal 2 hours before the last breath. Only the frequency and duration were slightly different.</p>
<p>This may be the dome preparing for energy transfer or balancing the pressure difference. Su Chian rushed over from the biology lab, holding the latest test report in her hand. There are unusual behaviors among marine life in the outer waters. She said schools of fish within 20 nautical miles of the edge of the fog are beginning to dive into deeper waters. The density of plankton near the surface is decreasing as if some kind of warning has been received.</p>
<p>Can they predict deep breaths? They may have sensed infrasound or subtle changes in water pressure. Sue Chanchian said many marine organisms are far more sensitive to environmental changes than our instruments. If they&#x27;re all fleeing, it means that what is about to happen will not be a minor disturbance. Line looked at the monitor screen and the isolation pod. Shening was sitting in a chair reading a book several marine geology monographs that Su Chian had provided at his request.</p>
<p>He seemed calm, but every few minutes he would look up at the clock on the wall. He&#x27;s waiting too. How long until the predicted time? Linmo asked. 3 hours and 42 minutes, Leeway replied. All monitoring equipment is in place and the samplers are ready.</p>
<p>This time we have set up fixed observation points at three distances. 40 nautical miles, 45 nautical miles, and 50 nautical miles. All of them use wire transmission and independent power supplies. So, they should be able to withstand the energy impact. What about Dragon Soul? Chandwood&#x27;s voice came through the communicator.</p>
<p>Their fleet has retreated to a distance of 70 nautical miles, but has increased the frequency of aerial patrols. Two high altitude reconnaissance aircraft are circling around the edge of the fog area, probably waiting for the deep breathing to begin. In addition, one of their submarines is diving at a distance of 30 nautical miles, seemingly trying to record underwater changes up close. Tell our monitoring stations to remain concealed and not reveal their location, Lynn Mo said. Clear.</p>
<p>Time pass second by second. The second sign appears 2 hours before you begin deep breathing. Sea surface temperatures began to rise abnormally, not across the entire area, but rather several distinct warm current zones formed in specific regions. These warm current zones were approximately 100 m wide and several kilome long, radiating outwards from the center of the fog affected area, resembling some kind of heat dissipation channel. Infrared satellite images show that the surface temperature of the warm current zone is 1.5 to 2° C higher than the surrounding seawater.</p>
<p>Such a significant temperature change in such a short period of time and in such a small area is highly unusual. Energy transmission channels leeway analyzed the fortress may be transferring heat through seawater to prepare for the upcoming deep breathing. The location and direction of the warm current zone correspond exactly to the geological fault lines on the seabed. It may be utilizing these natural channels. Very efficient.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo commented. It&#x27;s also very dangerous. Sue Chanchin added, &quot;If it can heat such a large area of seawater in a short time, the total amount of energy it releases will be astonishing.&quot; Last time the deep breathing only lasted 4 hours and caused an ecological disaster within 50 nautical miles. If this time it lasts longer and is more intense. She didn&#x27;t continue.</p>
<p>There is 1 hour left until the predicted time. The shadowy figure requested a call via internal communication. Mr. Lynn, I suggest you move the outermost monitoring point back another 5 nautical miles that his voice was calm. According to my calculations, the radius of influence of this breath will be 20% larger than the last one.</p>
<p>The observation 050 nautical miles away may be directly affected. Did your formula take into account the influence of warm currents? Leeway asked. IV considered it. Chining said the warm current is an auxiliary channel for energy transmission and will expand the area of influence. If you want to get the complete data without losing your equipment, you better listen to me.</p>
<p>Linmo thought for a few seconds. Withdraw all observation points 5 nautical miles, he ordered. The order was executed swiftly. The nearest mobile monitoring vessel towed the fixed observation point backward with a tow cable and re-anchored it. The entire process took 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Chenning looked at the surveillance footage and nodded. A wise choice. You seem to know this system very well. Lenmo said through the intercom. We studied it for a long time.</p>
<p>Shadow didn&#x27;t te deny. The Brotherhood s deep 1&#x27;s team spent three years collecting data and building models. We even successfully predicted the time of its last awakening 2 months earlier than the wings of Liberty S resonance activation. Unfortunately, the higherups didn&#x27;t t believe our warnings. What warning? The warning will not stop once it is activated, said the shadow.</p>
<p>Its program is self- sustaining. Once started, it will continue to run according to a preset blueprint until it achieves its goal or runs out of energy. And according to our calculations, its energy reserves are enough to run for centuries. Centuries. This number silence the command center for a moment.</p>
<p>What is its goal? Lynn Mo asked. Rebuilding a standard ecosystem. Chining said, &quot;We don&#x27;t tie fully understand what the specific standards are yet. But what is certain is that it will continuously transform the environment until it meets those standards. This process may be very long and it may be very radical.</p>
<p>Dot. There are 30 minutes left until the predicted time. The fog on the sea surface began to change. The previously still fog wall began to slowly rotate, forming a massive vortex centered on the fortress. The fog&#x27;s rotation was not fast, but its area was extremely large, involving the entire fog zone.</p>
<p>Satellite images show that the vortex is over 100 km in diameter and the central area is gradually becoming clearer there. A huge shadow can be vaguely seen beneath the sea surface which is the sleeping fortress. It is establishing an energy gradient. Dot leeway stared at the data. The rotating fog produces the corololis effect which helps the energy distribution to be more even.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pressure in the central region decreases which helps the energy from deeper layers to rise. Dot like the eye of a typhoon. Su Chian said the principles are similar but the purposes are different. Leeway said typhoons are natural phenomena but this is something that is controlled by humans. There are 10 minutes left until the predicted time.</p>
<p>All monitoring equipment is operating at the highest sampling frequency. Inside the command center, everyone was glued to their screens. The air was as tense as a top bowring. Chinning also stood in front of the observation window of the isolation chamber, looking towards the sea outside. Although he couldn&#x27;t see anything through the walls and the seawater, his posture was very focused.</p>
<p>5 minutes left in the countdown. Fine ripples began to appear on the surface of the sea. Not from the wind, but from vibrations caused by water surging up from underwater. 3 minutes left in the countdown. The deep sea microphone recorded a continuous low-frequency roar like the sound of some giant machine starting up.</p>
<p>1 minute countdown. The energy monitoring curve on the main screen began to climb much faster than before. The countdown has reached zero. Take a deep breath and begin. There was no violent explosion, no dazzling light, only increasingly stronger energy fluctuations surging up from beneath the sea surface.</p>
<p>Monitoring data showed that the temperature of the seaater around the fortress rose by 5° C within 5 minutes. Radiation levels began to climb, but not uniformly. Instead, they spread rapidly along the warm currents, forming several distinct high radiation channels. The magnetic field strength surged dramatically, fluctuating 20 times the normal range. Wireless communication was completely disrupted within a 30 nautical mile radius.</p>
<p>and wire transmission also experienced severe interference. The images transmitted from the outermost monitoring points started to shake, but the data was still being transmitted. The radius of influence has indeed expanded. Do leeway stared at the real-time map. Currently, the high radiation area has expanded to 48 nautical miles and it is still continuing.</p>
<p>The warm current zone has extended to 55 nautical miles away. Dot, what about biological reactions? Sue Chanchin asked mass mortality. The biological monitoring team reported in the observation cage we set up at 45 nautical miles. All 20 experimental organisms inside died within 10 minutes. They all exhibited severe convulsions and bleeding before death in the observation cage at 50 nautical miles.</p>
<p>The organisms also showed severe stress reactions and were not expected to survive more than an hour. Dot. Such Chanchian&#x27;s face turned pale. She pulled up the real-time analysis data of the seawater sample. The pH level is dropping rapidly, already down to 7.2 and still decreasing.</p>
<p>Dissolved oxygen concentrations have plummeted, reaching near zero levels in many areas. Meanwhile, nutrient concentrations are soaring, particularly nitrates and phosphates, reaching dozens of times the normal level. The water is rapidly acidifying, becoming oxygen deficient, and simultaneously utrophic, she whispered. This is a recipe for quick death. No multisellular organism that needs oxygen can survive.</p>
<p>But isn&#x27;t the goal to rebuild the ecosystem? Leeway asked, puzzled. How can you rebuild it if you kill all the existing life forms? Perhaps the ecosystem is trying to rebuild doesn&#x27;t need oxygen, Lyno said. This statement stunned everyone. An ecosystem that doesn&#x27;t need oxygen. What is that? An anorobic ecosystem? Su Chian realized in early Earth life was anorobic.</p>
<p>Later, cyanobacteria appeared, producing oxygen and changing the entire planet&#x27;s environment. If that fortress&#x27;s standard ecosystem was based on an anorobic environment, so what it&#x27;s doing now is clearing away pollution oxygen and oxygen dependent organisms. Lynn Mo continued, &quot;This reasoning sounds crazy, but it makes logical sense. If the civilization that designed the fortress considered an oxygen-rich environment to be abnormal, then eliminating oxygen and aerobic organisms would be the first step in restoring the environment. But we all need oxygen,&quot; Shouse said.</p>
<p>&quot;So in its view, we are also anomalies that need to be eliminated.&quot; Shien Woodw&#x27;s voice came through the communicator, carrying a hint of coldness. I continued deep breathing for an hour. The radius of influence has expanded to 52 nautical miles, which is exactly the upper limit of the predicted tidal shadow. The warm current zone extends to 60 nautical miles away, but the radiation level there is already very low. Dragon Soul submarine was forced to surface at 30 nautical miles.</p>
<p>The underwater environment had become too harsh, and all of the submarine&#x27;s external sensors were damaged. They are now retreating at full speed to a safe area. The Coral Society&#x27;s high altitude reconnaissance aircraft captured clear images of the center of the fog. A huge whirlpool with churning seawater in the center and faintly visible rhythmic flashes of blue light underwater. Energy output is stable at its peak.</p>
<p>Leeway reported based on the previous pattern, this state will last for 3 to 4 hours and then we will begin to recover energy. How much more intense is this time compared to the last one? The average intensity is 1.8 8 times that of the last one. The peak intensity is 2.3 times that of the last one. If it continues for 4 hours, the ecosystem within 50 nautical miles could be completely reset. Reset.</p>
<p>This word is used precisely and cruy. Lyno looked toward the isolation pod. Channing was still standing by the window, his hands in his pockets, his back steady. He seemed to have anticipated all of this. Contact him, Lyno said.</p>
<p>The call was connected. Your prediction was very accurate, Linmo said. Thank you. The shadow turned around. Now you believe in my worth.</p>
<p>I believe some of it, Linmo said directly. Tell me your cooperation plan. Chining walked back to the chair and sat down. The administrator agreement is divided into two parts. Identity authentication and knowledge testing, he said.</p>
<p>Identity authentication requires a specific genetic sequence, which we may not be able to handle unless we can find the designer as direct descendants. if there are any but we could try the knowledge testing dot what knowledge regarding the design principles operating mechanisms and ultimate goals of this facility. Chinying said the purpose of the testing is to ensure that administrators understand the system and can use it correctly rather than abusing or misusing it. How did you know about the test? The Brotherhood has collected a lot of materials including some designers notes and fragments of training manuals. Chennying said, &quot;I brought most of them.</p>
<p>We can study them together and try to crack the test logic. What happens after you pass the test? By passing the knowledge test, we can obtain temporary administrator privileges which allow us to adjust system operating parameters and even pause certain programs. Chennying said, &quot;While it s not as good as full privileges, it is enough for us to stop it from continuing to damage the environment. Though how long can a temporary administrator maintain control? I&#x27;m not sure, but according to the information, it should last for at least a few months. During this time, we can look for ways to obtain full access or think of other solutions.</p>
<p>Then Mo pondered, &quot;The plan sounds feasible, but it&#x27;s very risky. First, they need access to the fortress currently occupied by remnants of the Wings of Liberty and equipped with autonomous defense systems. Second, they need to find an interface for testing, which might be deep within the fortress. Finally, the test itself could be dangerous. What happens if it fails? The documentation doesn&#x27;t say, &quot;What is the current status of the remnants of Wings of Liberty?&quot; Lynn Emmo asked a crucial question.</p>
<p>It has terrible. The shadow said, &quot;When we last made contact, the people inside were already showing serious physiological changes. Some people started refusing to wear protective suits, saying they can&#x27;t even feel the radiation. Some people were hallucinating, claiming to hear the systems whispers.&quot; dot. Most frighteningly, they started to identify with the fortresses goals, believing that environmental modification was a necessary evil.</p>
<p>Dot assimilated. Yes. The shadow s voice deepened, so I have to act quickly. Several of my friends are still inside. They might still be saved, but if we delay any longer, he didn&#x27;t finish speaking.</p>
<p>Enter the second hour with deep breathing. Monitoring data shows that radiation levels have begun to fluctuate periodically as if the system is undergoing some kind of internal adjustment. The eddies on the surface of the sea slowed their rotation while the water in the central area churned more violently. Occasionally, huge bubbles would rise from the depths, releasing a pale blue light as they burst. What is it releasing? Such an asked.</p>
<p>It could be a byproduct of energy metabolism or it could be something else. Leeway analyzed the spectral data. The gas composition is complex containing methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and some unknown organic compounds. These gases are ionized during their ascent, hence the luminescence. A system that releases large amounts of methane and hydrogen from a seabed.</p>
<p>If its goal is to establish an anorobic ecosystem, then these gases are the raw materials for the new ecosystem. It&#x27;s preparing for the next stage. Lynn Emmo said, &quot;What stage? Introduce anorobic organisms or modify existing organisms so they can survive in the new environment.&quot; Sue Chanchin speculated. Clear the area first, then sew seeds. It asked the standard ecological reconstruction process.</p>
<p>But whose seeds were used? Whose blueprints? There is still 2 hours until the deep breathing session ends. Lynmo made a decision. Shadow, we can cooperate, he said. But before we take action, we need to see all your information and verify it. At the same time, we need to develop a detailed plan, including methods for entering the fortress, strategies for dealing with the wings of freedom, and an escape route.</p>
<p>I understand Chenning said, &quot;The data is on my storage device, and you can make a copy for the study, but I have one condition. I I need to participate in the research process. There are some things that only I can explain clearly.&quot; Dot. Okay. Lyn Mo agreed.</p>
<p>Also, you will remain in the isolation pod during the planning process. This is for the safety of both of us. Dot. I understand. Dot.</p>
<p>Chini nodded. Also, I suggest you keep an eye on Dragon Soulless movements. They might take action after deep breathing ends. According to my intelligence, some within Dragon Soul have already proposed using tactical nuclear weapons to destroy the fortress. Do they dare? If they perceive the threat as significant enough, they will.</p>
<p>Chinnying said, &quot;From Dragon Celeste perspective, this fortress is an unknown, uncontrollable threat that is causing a massive ecological disaster. Solving it once and for all with nuclear weapons align with their logic.&quot; Lynn Mo ended the call. He looked out the window. The whirlpool on the sea was still slowly rotating, and the blue light in the center was flashing more and more frequently. The deep breathing continued, and time is slipping away little by little.</p>
<p>Chapter 142. When the fog disperses, the deep breathing lasted for 4 hours and 17 minutes. As the energy release curve began to plummet, Leeway stared intently at the screen, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. According to the information provided by Chinnying, the subsequent recovery phase would be more intense than the release with the system recovering the dissipated energy and matter with maximum efficiency. Sure enough, radiation levels plummeted below baseline within half an hour, becoming 50% lower than before the deep breathing began.</p>
<p>Seawater temperature dropped simultaneously. Warm currents vanished without a trace, and a thin film of ice, even formed on the surface, extremely unnatural in warm waters. The fog wall began to dissipate. It wasn&#x27;t blown away by the wind, but rather as if drawn back by an invisible hand, rapidly contracting from the outside in. The grayish white mist flowed back along a certain regular path, converging towards the central area, eventually forming a huge funnel-shaped vortex on the sea surface before being sucked into the deep sea.</p>
<p>The whole process was clean and efficient, leaving no residue. The fog dissipated, but the remaining sea area was completely unrecognizable. Monitoring data is being transmitted back continuously. The marine ecosystem within 52 nautical miles has suffered a devastating blow. Plankton density has decreased by more than 99%.</p>
<p>Fish have almost disappeared and coral and sponge communities on the seabed have died on a large scale. The water is severely acidified with pH values generally below 7.0 reaching 6.5 in some areas. Dissolved oxygen concentrations are close to zero. This is a dead sea. How long will it take for the ecosystem to recover? Lynn Emmo asked.</p>
<p>Such an looked at the data model with a grim expression. Without external intervention, natural recovery could take decades. She said water acidification and hypoxia can persist for a long time, making it difficult for new organisms to survive in such an environment, even if they migrate in from the outside. What is more troubling is that we detected high concentrations of heavy metals and radioactive isotopes. These were released from seabed sediments and could have been present for centuries.</p>
<p>Do is this the kind of environment a fortress needs? It asks very likely Sue Chanchian pulled up a report. We found a large number of anorobic microbial spores in water samples we collected at a depth of 48 nautical miles. These spores were originally buried deep in the seabed sediment layer but have now been released into the water. Once conditions are right, they will germinate and reproduce. What are the conditions? Oxygen-free, acidic, and rich in specific minerals.</p>
<p>Souk Chian said that exactly the condition the sea area has right now. Dot. Then Mo understood the fortress wasn&#x27;t being destroyed randomly. It was being precisely prepared as a culture medium. First clean the site, sterilize it, adjust the environmental parameters, and then sew the seeds.</p>
<p>What kind of ecosystem do those anorobic microorganisms form? I don&#x27;t know. Sue Chanchchin shook her head. Modern oceans are almost entirely aerobic ecosystems and anorobic microorganisms only exist in small quantities in some extreme environments. There is no precedent for what would happen if they multiplied on a large scale. Dot.</p>
<p>The command center fell silent. Outside the window, the sea had returned to calm. Sunlight shone on the still scarred waters, making them shimmer and appear normal. But underwater, death was spreading. At 10:00 a.m., the lurking devices storage device was sent to the isolation analysis room.</p>
<p>It was a palmsized metal cube with no interfaces or markings on its surface. After examining it with a scanner, Leeway confirmed that it used a non-standard encrypted data storage technology, had a complex internal structure, and featured physical anti-tamper design. We need his biometrics and password. Leeway reported Linmo arrived at the isolation chamber. Shanning was already prepared.</p>
<p>He walked to the pass through window, placed his palm on the designated area, and whispered a 16-digit password. The metal cube glowed with a faint blue light for 3 seconds before going out. It s ready, the shadow said. It s now readable, but it can only connect to non-network devices. If a network connection is detected, it will automatically lock and erase the data.</p>
<p>Dot very cautious, Linimo said. We must be careful. Dot. Chianing returned to his chair. Some people are willing to risk their lives for the information in here.</p>
<p>Leewi connected the device to a completely isolated analysis terminal. There was no internet connection, no wireless module, and all unnecessary peripherals were disconnected. Data reading begins. The first batch of data declassified was the observation log of the Brotherhood of Stonemason&#x27;s deep divers over the past 3 years. It included thousands of pages of written reports, tens of thousands of images, and massive amounts of sensor data.</p>
<p>The timeline spanned from the discovery of the fortress to its activation by the Wings of Liberty. Leeway quickly skimmed through the abstract. Their observations are far more detailed than ours. He said they recorded the fortresses energy fluctuation cycles, magnetic field change patterns, and even predicted that it would periodically self-maintain. Data shows that the fortress conducts a deep self check on average every 81 years.</p>
<p>The last one being 67 years ago. If it follows the normal cycle, it will remain dormant for at least another 14 years. The activation of Wings of Liberty accelerated this process. Not only was it brought forward, but it also disrupted its program. Leewi pulled up a technical analysis document.</p>
<p>According to the Deep Ones 1&#x27;s research, the normal awakening of a fortress should be a gradual process requiring external administrator authentication and command input. But the resonance technology used by Wings of Liberty is essentially a brute force attack forcibly activating its basic system with a high energy pulse, skipping all security verification stuff. So, it&#x27;s in safe mode now. It s worse than safe mode. Lewi said it asks like a computer being forced to boot up but the operating system is corrupted so it can only run some basic programs.</p>
<p>These programs run according to preset instructions but they have lost the control and regulation of higher level logic. Such Chanchian also joined the analysis. She focused on the biological impact. The data contains extensive research on bioactive factors. The deep sea divers collected hundreds of biological samples from the area surrounding the fortress, recording physiological changes under long-term exposure.</p>
<p>The results were alarming. Fish exhibited abnormal organ proliferation. Crustaceians showed altered shell structures and algae displayed disordered gene expression. They conducted human cell experiments. Sue Chantians voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>They use volunteer cell culture dishes to contact the active factors. After 24 hours, the cells began to spontaneously reorganize, forming a structure similar to a neural network. After 48 hours, these structures began to release electrical signals as if they were communicating. And then what? The experiment was abruptly terminated and all samples were destroyed. Such Chanchian flipped through the records, but several deep ones who participated in the study reported that in the following weeks they experienced auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and involuntary muscle twitches.</p>
<p>One of them even wrote down an undecipherable code in his sleep. Nerve infection. It&#x27;s possible that the active factors affected the nervous system in some way. Such Chanchian said, &quot;Based on the data, it is speculated that these factors can not only modify physiological structures, but also transmit information, even information at the level of consciousness.&quot; Lynn Mo looked at the shadowy figure inside the isolation chamber. Has this person been exposed to the active factor? Has he been affected? At 2 p.m., the data analysis moved into its core section, the administrator agreement.</p>
<p>This part of the content was clearly encrypted at a higher level and the decryption process took nearly an hour. What was ultimately revealed was a series of complex technical documents and design drawings. This is the structural diagram of the fortress. Leeway zoomed in on a three-dimensional cross-sectional view. The images show that the fortress is divided into seven layers.</p>
<p>The top layer contains the defense system and external interfaces. The middle three layers are production, storage, and energy zones. And the bottom three layers are the core control area and database. The entire structure resembles an inverted pyramid with most of its volume buried deep beneath the seabed. The administrator interface is here.</p>
<p>Leeway pointed to a location in the core area. You need to enter from the inside and there are multiple verifications. You can only gain access after passing physical access control, gene scanning, and knowledge tests. Is there an alternative entrance? Yes, but they read all at a deeper level requiring drilling through the seabed which is extremely risky. Leeway pulled up another map or you can enter from directly above the fortress.</p>
<p>There an emergency maintenance passage here which is normally closed but may be briefly opened during system selfch check. When is the next selfch check? Leway check the records based on its operating cycle. The next partial selfch check should be in 72 hours. It will last for about 15 minutes during which time the passage will open but only enough for one or two people to enter quickly and you must return within 15 minutes otherwise the passage will close and you&#x27;ll have to take the internal route. 72 hours 3 days time is very tight.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the content of the knowledge test? Lynn Mo asked this part of the data is more fragmented. The deep diver team mainly collected the logical framework of the test and some sample questions. The test is divided into three parts. System principles, ecological ethics, and civilization survival. The system principles section examines the understanding of the fortress&#x27;s design philosophy and operational mechanisms.</p>
<p>The ecological ethics section examines the manager&#x27;s value judgments regarding environmental modification. The civilization survival section examines the decision-making ability under disaster scenarios. The questions are all open-ended with no standard answers, Leeway said. But the system will score based on the logical consistency of the answer, its value orientation, and the degree of adherence to preset principles. The passing score is 80%.</p>
<p>What if it doesn&#x27;t pass? The document doesn&#x27;t say, but it mentions that those who fail need to undergo re-education. There&#x27;s no record of what the re-education specifically entails. It&#x27;s very likely not a pleasant experience. At 4:00 in the afternoon, Chin Duodo brought the latest developments from all sides. Dragon Soulless fleet has begun its advance.</p>
<p>His voice carried an urgency. They reentered the 50 nautical mile zone and are deploying deep sea probes. Meanwhile, their high alitude reconnaissance aircraft have taken clear photographs of the fortresses surface showing clear structural changes. What changes? Some previously sealed hatches have opened, revealing the equipment inside. Judging from their shape, they could be weapon launch ports or exits from production units.</p>
<p>Shien duodo paused. In addition, according to information from within Dragon Soul, the nuclear weapons proposal has entered the formal discussion stage. They are assessing strike plans and potential environmental impacts. What about the Coral Society? They set up a temporary research station on the edge of the Dead Sea and began collecting water samples and biological remains. However, their focus does not seem to be on the ecological disaster, but rather on the newly emerging anorobic microorganisms.</p>
<p>One researcher publicly stated that this is an excellent opportunity to study early life on Earth. The Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood, a complete shutdown, all external activities suspended. But our sources say there&#x27;s a split within the Brotherhood with some younger members dissatisfied with the conservative attitude of the higher-ups and plotting independent action. Someone might try to make contact with the fortress. Lynn Emmo ended the communication.</p>
<p>He walked to the map and looked at the area of the sea that had just undergone a deep breath. It was calm now, as if nothing had happened, but the monitoring data told him that something new was brewing underwater. The spores of anorobic microorganisms are germinating. Heavy metals and radioactive materials are slowly settling. The aquatic environment is moving closer to a certain preset standard.</p>
<p>72 hours later, the fortress will open its self inspection channel. Compile the information into a briefing. Lynn Emmo said to Leewi, &quot;We need to develop a complete plan. How to approach the fortress, how to enter the passage, how to pass the test, how to rescue people, and how to retreat the should we involve hidden shadow?&quot; Yes. Lynn Mo nodded, but only in an isolated environment via video conference.</p>
<p>Tell him they need to know all the details. The exact location of the passage, the route after entering, the possible defense systems we might encounter and the location and distribution of the remnants of the wings of Liberty. What if he&#x27;s lying? Then let us verify it. Lynamo said, &quot;Use our own data to compare with his information. We need to clarify any contradictions.&quot; Dot.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., Chinnang participated in the first planning meeting via encrypted video from inside the isolation pod. He seemed very cooperative, answering every question. He provided detailed parameters regarding the location of the passage, the entry angle, and the time window. He even drew a partial route map inside the fortress, marking the areas where the Wings of Liberty might operate. They remain concentrated on the top three floors right now, Chining said, pointing to the structural diagram near the production line because there are food synthesis equipment and medical facilities there.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t te get into the controlled area. The defense system onet allow it. Can you contact the people inside? It asked difficult. Dot. Chinn shook his head.</p>
<p>Communications inside the fortress are closely monitored, but I have a few agreed upon signaling methods such as leaving markers in specific areas. If they see them, they might respond a rescue priorities. The shadowy figure remains silent for a few seconds. Save those who can still remain conscious first, he concluded. Those who have already been assimilated may be beyond saving, but at least give them a choice.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted until 8:00 p.m. The preliminary plan is complete. 3 days later, utilizing the fortress&#x27;s 15minute self inspection window, we will enter from directly above an especially designed deep sea submersible. The crew will be reduced to two people in MMO and chinning. The others will be responsible for perimeter support and evacuation.</p>
<p>The risk is extremely high, but this is currently the only opportunity. After the meeting, Lynn Mo remained alone in the command center. He looked at the 3D model of the fortress on the screen. The inverted pyramid structure casting a huge shadow on the seabed. 72 hours.</p>
<p>Many things can happen during this period. Dragon Soul may launch a nuclear missile. The Coral Society might cause some unexpected problems. The radical faction of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood may take action. Underwater, anorobic microorganisms are multiplying.</p>
<p>Time is passing. Outside the window, the moon rose over the sea. Its cool light shining on the recently extinguished waters. Silence. But Lynn Emmo knew that this silence wouldn&#x27;t last long.</p>
<p>New changes will come soon. Chapter 143. Preparation and variables. The day after the plan was finalized, the Mayuan Pavilion base entered a period of intense preparation. Leeway was in charge of modifying the deep sea submersible.</p>
<p>The small submersible, originally used for scientific research and observation, was towed into the dock and began a large-scale modification. An additional pressureresistant layer and an electromagnetic shielding layer were added to the outer shell. The propulsion system was upgraded to a silent model and all navigation equipment was replaced with an interference resistant mechanical inertial composite system. The most troublesome part was the interior space. The cabin, which originally accommodated three people, needed to be rearranged to make room for equipment while ensuring that two people could move freely inside.</p>
<p>Leeway and his technical team worked continuously for 18 hours, revising the blueprints seven times before finally finalizing the plan. Oxygen reserves are enough for 48 hours and food and water are enough for 72 hours. Leeway reported to Lynn Mo his eyes bloodshot. We have two communication systems. One is conventional sonar communication, but it may fail inside the fortress.</p>
<p>The other is an emergency underwater cable communication system, but requires laying spools and has limited range. What about defense? Only the most basic ones do pulled up the design drawings. two high voltage stun guns with a range of 5 meters. They can be used against humans, but their effectiveness against machines or mutated creatures is questionable. There are also four acoustic stun grenades which can create shock waves underwater, but the user will also be affected when using them.</p>
<p>Dot, that&#x27;s enough, Linimo said. We&#x27;re not going to fight a war. Such an studying samples of anorobic microorganisms in another laboratory. The spores in the water samples collected from the edge of the Dead Sea had already begun to germinate. Under the microscope, the grayish white hy grew slowly, intertwining and forming a thin membrane-like structure.</p>
<p>The growth rate is faster than expected that she recorded the data. For every degree the temperature rises, the division cycle shortens by 15%. At this rate, a visible bacterial film will appear on the surface of this sea area in 3 days. What the dangers? It is not clear yet. Such Chanchin said, &quot;But the bacterial film may change the optical properties of a sea surface affecting the penetration of light.</p>
<p>The deeper impact is on the ecosystem if they proliferate on a large scale. They will consume organic matter in the water and release methane and hydrogen sulfide. The latter is toxic and deadly to most marine life.&quot; She paused for a moment. Moreover, the metabolic products of these microorganisms may enter the atmosphere. Hydrogen sulfide will be converted into sulfur dioxide in the upper atmosphere, further affecting the climate.</p>
<p>A local problem is evolving into a regional problem. Chindwood was intelligence network operates around the clock. More and more information is coming from Dragon Soul. The nuclear weapons proposal has moved from the discussion stage to the feasibility study stage. There are three specific plans.</p>
<p>First, to directly hit the fortress&#x27;s surface structure and destroy it with a shock wave. Second, to strike the seabed supporting it, causing it to collapse and be buried. And third, to detonate it in nearby waters, triggering an underwater landslide that covers it. The third option has the most supporters. Chien Duo Duo said it has a relatively small impact on the environment and a high success rate.</p>
<p>Geological expert from Dragon Soul have completed simulations and believe that dropping three medium yield nuclear bombs at a specific location could trigger a large-scale sliding of seafloor sedimentary layers. What about time? Preparations can be completed in as little as 5 days. Dot Chian Duo Duo paused. But there are internal disagreements. Some people think we should wait and see what the fortress does next.</p>
<p>Others believe that the risk increases with each day of delay. The Coral Society acted even faster. They established three permanent research stations on the edge of the Dead Sea and began continuous 24-hour observations. The latest report shows that a biofilm of anorobic microorganisms has appeared in a localized area of about 2 km and is expanding at a rate of 30% per day. The academic community is very excited.</p>
<p>She and Duodo said several senior researchers even proposed to actively fertilize the microorganisms to accelerate their growth in order to study their complete life cycle. Although this proposal was rejected, it shows that their focus is not on ecological disasters at all. Dot. The Stonemasons Brotherhood remained silent, but she and Duodo noticed some unusual fund flows. Several accounts linked to the Brotherhood were making large-scale purchases of deep sea diving equipment and special materials with the suppliers being several long-established European military companies.</p>
<p>Someone is making preparations, but we Danty know who it is or what they re going to do. Chin Duodo concluded. The following afternoon, the Shadow completed a detailed map of the fortress&#x27;s interior routes inside the isolation chamber. He used video conferencing to draw a 3D path diagram bit by bit on a shared screen. Starting from the entrance passage, it goes through a sloping maintenance pipe, enters the upper corridor, then goes down through the production area, and finally reaches the perimeter of the control area.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a fork in the road here. Chenning pointed to a location with the cursor. Left leads to the energy core. Right leads to the database. We need to go to the database first.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an interface there for conducting knowledge tests. What will we encounter on the road? Linmo asked. First, there is the automatic defense system. Shadow said the monitoring system inside the fortress should still be working, but based on the experience of the Wings of Liberty, the system usually one tack unless you enter a clearly prohibited area. The bigger threat is the people of the Wings of Liberty.</p>
<p>They could be anywhere. Dot. How many of them are there? The latest intelligence indicates that there are approximately 30 to 40 people, but they&#x27;re scattered across various areas. Some may have already lost their mobility, while others may have become aggressive. Chining pulled up several blurry photos taken from early reconnaissance data.</p>
<p>The images showed several people in protective suits, but their postures were strange. Some are huddled in a corner, some were standing still, and some are talking to a wall. These are images from 2 weeks ago. Their condition may be worse now. How do we avoid them? Try to use the maintenance passages and pipe levels.</p>
<p>Chining said, &quot;Those places are narrow and they rarely go there. But the downside is that the routes are complicated and it is easy to get lost. I will remember the main landmarks, but if I encounter a branch, I may need to make a judgment on the spot.&quot; The meeting lasted for over an hour. Chenning described the characteristics, potential risks, and coping strategies for each key point in as much detail as possible. Lynn and Mo took notes, intending to create a simple guide.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Leewi came to find Lin Mo holding a tablet in his hand. The deep sea submersible modifications can be completed tonight and testing can begin tomorrow, he said. But there&#x27;s a problem. The power system, it needs to supply propulsion, life support, shielding, and equipment simultaneously. At full capacity, it can only sustain operation for 30 hours.</p>
<p>What if there&#x27;s an unexpected delay? Streamline the equipment. Lynn Mo said except for life support and propulsion, everything else can be reduced as appropriate. The shielding layer can have its power reduced and the navigation equipment can be used intermittently. Extend the power reserve to 40 hours. This would increase the risk.</p>
<p>Entering the fortress itself carries risks. Lynn Mo said, &quot;What we need to do is balance the risks, not eliminate them.&quot; Dot. Leeway nodded and went back to work. As evening fell, Sue Chanchand brought a new discovery. An abnormal growth pattern has emerged in the anorobic microbial bofilm.</p>
<p>Instead of expanding evenly, the bofilm has thickened significantly in certain areas, forming several radial ridges. These ridges extend outward from the center of the Dead Sea, pointing precisely towards several important surrounding marine ecosystems. It acts like establishing a connection channel that Sue Chanchian pointed to the satellite image. The mcelium is actively adjusting its growth direction extending towards areas richer in nutrients. Moreover, the mcelial density inside the ridges is particularly high which may indicate a stronger material transport capacity.</p>
<p>What you transmitting? It could be spores or it could be metabolic products. Such Chanchchan said, &quot;What worries me more is that we detected trace amounts of active factors in the water samples at the end of the ridge line, the same components released by the fortress.&quot; Dot. Lynn Emmo stared at the grayish white lines on the image. They spread across the sea surface like blood vessels connecting the Dead Sea to the surrounding healthy waters. Is the fortress expanding its sphere of influence? Or it could be building some kind of infrastructure? Su Chanchian said, &quot;If the bacterial film can stably transport matter and energy, then it can deliver active factors to more distant places without moving the fortress.&quot; This hypothesis reminded Lin Mo of the nanoparticle network in the fog.</p>
<p>Both are distributed structures and can transmit matter and information. The fortress&#x27;s transformation strategy appears to be multi-layered. large-scale fog and deep breathing for environmental resetting. Fine nano networks for monitoring and microbial membrane networks for material transport. A complete system is taking shape.</p>
<p>At 8:00 p.m., Sherhow reported on the adjustments to the defense deployment. We have added three layers of monitoring network around the base, he said, showing the deployment map. The outermost layer is a sonar buoy array covering a radius of 20 nautical miles. The middle layer consists of patrol boats and drones responsible for mobile response. The innermost layer is shore-based defense facilities, including high-pressure water cannons and sonic generators.</p>
<p>What threat are you referring to? The main threat is biological. Sure house said if those mutated creatures or microbial membranes expand in our direction, we need to issue early warnings and intercept them. In addition, we also need to guard against infiltration by other forces. Dragon Soul, the Brotherhood, and even the Wings of Liberty may send people over. What about the evacuation plan? It has already been planned.</p>
<p>Sure, how pulled up another document. In extreme circumstances, all core personnel and critical supplies can be evacuated within 4 hours, but that would mean abandoning the base, which would result in significant losses. Doc, I hope we won&#x27;t need it, Lin Mo said. Late at night, Lynn Mo arrived at the dock alone. The submersible undergoing modification sat in the dock, scaffolding erected on its hull where technicians were still busy at work.</p>
<p>The blue light of welding torches flashed in the night, and the rhythmic clanging of metal echoed. 3 days later, he will ride in this iron canister to dive more than 100 m into the seabed and enter an ancient facility full of unknowns. The risk is very high. it might not be able to come back. But he had no better choice.</p>
<p>Letting the fortress continue operating would eventually destroy this sea area and everything the mo yuan pavilion had built. Taking the initiative offered at least a sliver of hope. Then montak such voice came from behind her. She walked to his side and looked at the deep sea submersible in the dock. Are you worried? She asked.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m worried Linmo answered truthfully. But the things that need to be done still need to be done. I can come along. My knowledge of biology might be useful. Dot.</p>
<p>No. Linmo shook his head. The situation inside is too complicated. I need you to stay outside. If something goes wrong, at least someone will know what happened and someone can continue to work on solutions.</p>
<p>Dot. Suchan remained silent for a while. You must come back, she finally said. I&#x27;ll try. The two stood side by side watching the bustling activity in the dock.</p>
<p>The night was deep and the sea breeze carried a salty damp scent. On the distant sea, moonlight shone on the Dead Sea region where everything was pitch black, devoid of any reflection. Microbial bofilms were growing. Nano particles were likely still suspended and the fortress lay silently awaiting its next self inspection on the seabed. There are still two days left.</p>
<p>Many things may happen and many things must be prepared for, but at least for this moment, there&#x27;s still a brief moment of peace. Lynamo took a deep breath and turned to leave the dock. There&#x27;s still a lot of work to do. There&#x27;s no time to linger. Chapter 144, the eve of departure.</p>
<p>24 hours before departure. In the equipment room on the third basement floor of Mo Yuan Pavilion, Linmo and Shiening were conducting a final check. Two black waterproof backpacks were laid out on a long table, and every item inside was carefully evaluated, weighed, and secured. Two oxygen regeneration canisters, each with three replacement cartridges. 24 compressed rations, each only the size of a thumb, but providing 400 calories.</p>
<p>A first aid kit sealed in a waterproof bag containing not only standard medications, but also radiation antidote and nerve sedatives. Chining picked up a multi-tool knife, weighed it in her hand, and then put it back. &quot;We on one te bring this,&quot; he said. &quot;The internal structural materials of the fortress are very special. Ordinary knives can&#x27;t te cut them and might even trigger the stress sensing system.</p>
<p>Then what should we use?&quot; Lynn Mo asked. Chenning took out two short metal rods from his equipment about 20 cm long with fine patterns on their surface. He held one end and twisted it gently and the other end popped out a semi-transparent crystal blade gleaming with a faint blue light. Highfrequency oscillating blade. Chinnying explained the blade vibrates 40,000 times per second, capable of cutting through most materials and generates almost no heat, making it difficult for thermal detectors to detect.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo took one and tried it out. It felt very light and had good balance. Brotherhood technology an improved version dot chining didn&#x27;t he say much sheathing the knife Ichi take one but hopefully we one teen need them dot the communication equipment was the most difficult decision to make the interference inside the fortress was too strong making conventional radio communication virtually useless team tried several solutions and finally selected an underwater communication system based on ultrasonic modulation its effective range was only 500 m, but its advantage lay in its strong anti-inference capabilities. WLL also bring these. Leeway took out two devices the size of matchboxes.</p>
<p>Short-range laser communicators. We can use these if we encounter obstacles that block the sound waves. But the line of sight between the two points needs to be clear and there can be no suspended particles interfering. Dot. What about the backup plan? There is no backup plan.</p>
<p>Lewi said frankly, &quot;Even a lot of equipment could fail in that environment. You have to be prepared for a complete loss of contact.&quot; Then Montac nuted. He had considered this possibility long ago. The equipment inspection lasted 2 hours. The function, usage, and emergency alternatives of every item were repeatedly confirmed.</p>
<p>Shadow&#x27;s understanding of the fortress played a crucial role. He knew what was useful and what was superfluous. Dante, bring any electronic timing devices? He cautioned, &quot;The Fortress S energy field will interfere with the crystal oscillator, causing time to run fast or slow. Use this.&quot; He took out two oldfashioned mechanical watches with three hands on the dial and thick cases. When fully wound up, it can last for 40 hours with an error of no more than 10 seconds per day.</p>
<p>Inside, the sense of time can easily become confused, so a reliable reference is essential. Such Chian was conducting final biological tests in the adjacent laboratory. The bacterial film in the Dead Sea area was expanding at an accelerated rate, now covering more than 50 square kilm of the sea surface. Even more disturbing was the fact that the film was showing stratification. The surface layer was composed of ordinary grayish white hy while the underlying layer contained a dense dark red structure.</p>
<p>It s like it s differentiating that she told Lynmo who had come to check. The surface layer is responsible for photosynthesis or material exchange while the lower layer may be responsible for structural support or other functions. We took a sample and sliced it and found a microtubial system similar to blood vessels in a dark red layer dot. What you transmitting? I don&#x27;t know, but there is liquid flowing in the micro tubes and the flow rate is very regular. Sue Chanchian brought up the microscopic image.</p>
<p>Moreover, these bacterial films are now starting to release a gas mainly composed of methane and hydrogen sulfide, but mixed with trace amounts of organic compounds which have a similar structure to the active factors released by the fortress. Is it spreading active ingredients? Possibly. Su Chanchient said the wind will carry the gas to farther places. Although the concentration is very low, the long-term effects of exposure are unpredictable. Lynn Mo and Mo watched the bacterial film image on the screen expand continuously.</p>
<p>Grayish white and dark red intertwined like a huge wound slowly growing on the sea surface. Once we enter the fortress, you continue monitoring, he told Su Chanchian. If there are any unusual changes, record them. If the situation gets out of control, evacuate according to the contingency plan. Dot.</p>
<p>Such Chian wanted to say something, but in the end, she just nodded. At 300 PM, Chi and Duo Duo brought a summary of the latest intelligence from all parties. Dragon Soul&#x27;s nuclear strike plan has entered its final stage of evaluation. They have deployed a strategic nuclear submarine, which is currently on standby 100 nautical miles east of the Dead Sea. At the same time, three bombers carrying bunker buster warheads have been stationed at the forward base as a backup plan.</p>
<p>But they still hesitant, Chin Duo said. The latest reconnaissance photos show more openings on the Fortress S sur surface, some of which reveal moving mechanical structures. Dragon Solless technical advisers believe this may be part of some kind of defense upgrade and recommend taking action as soon as possible. What about the Coral Society? They are now divided into two factions. Do flipped through the report.</p>
<p>One faction advocates immediately collecting a large number of bacterial film samples and transporting them back to the main base for genetic modification research attempting to cultivate a controllable version. The other faction believes this is too dangerous and advocates establishing an isolation zone for observation first. Which faction has the upper hand? The radicals. The council has just approved an emergency grant to purchase large-scale culture equipment and biosafety facilities. It looks like they really intend to cultivate those microorganisms on a large scale.</p>
<p>A madman, Leewi said in a low voice. Will the Stonemason&#x27;s brothers make any new moves? Shin Duo Duo paused. Yes, but it has strange, he said. We detected that security at several of the Brotherhood s outer outposts has suddenly been tightened with all personnel undergoing strict checks to enter and exit. At the same time, a batch of special supplies was secretly transported to the southeast, including high precision sonar arrays and deep sea drilling equipment.</p>
<p>What are they trying to do? I don&#x27;t know, but it is definitely related to the fortress. Chandu duo said also the remnants of the wings of freedom have started selling their goods on the black market again, but this time it is not energy crystals, but some strange biological tissue samples. They res said to have been collected from inside the fortress and they were priced extremely high, but they were quickly bought by anonymous buyers. Lynmo recalled Chiening mentioning that the people inside the fortress might be experiencing physiological changes. Could those biological tissue samples be? He shook his head, suppressing the thought.</p>
<p>In the evening, the submersible completed its final underwater test. Leewei personally piloted the vehicle, diving to a depth of 100 meters in the waters surrounding the base to test all systems. Propulsion, steering, life support, communications, and shielding all met design specifications. There is only one problem, Leeway reported after coming ashore. In a simulated fortress energy field environment, the power consumption of a shielding layer is 30% higher than expected.</p>
<p>If there is strong interference, the power consumption will be even faster. Can it be optimized? It has too late. Leewi said we can only bring an extra set of spare batteries, but that will increase the weight and affect our maneuverability. After discussing it with Chennying, Lynn Emo decided not to bring a spare battery. The best way to conserve power is to get inside the fortress as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Chining said once weary inside the maintenance corridor external interference will decrease. What we need is speed not endurance dot. It was late at night 8 hours before departure. All preparations are complete. The submersible is docked at pier 3 fully charged and has undergone inspection.</p>
<p>Equipment packs have been loaded and secured in their designated positions. Route maps and emergency plans have been printed out, laminated and distributed to each person. Linmo made final arrangements at the command center. While I&#x27;m away, the base will be jointly managed by Isu Chian and Sherhao. He told the core members, &quot;Lewi will be in charge of technical support and Chin Duo will be in charge of intelligence monitoring.</p>
<p>If we do not return within 72 hours and there is no news, we will handle it as the worst case scenario.&quot; What&#x27;s the worst case scenario? Sure, how asked. Dragon Soul launches a nuclear strike or other forces trigger catastrophic consequences. Linmo said, &quot;At that time, you will need to decide whether to evacuate or take other actions. There are contingency plans, but you must be flexible and adaptable to the situation. The atmosphere in the room was heavy.</p>
<p>We will maintain communication monitoring.&quot; Leewi said, &quot;Although the chances are slim, we will definitely receive any signals you send. Be prepared that we may not come back,&quot; Linimo said calmly. This is not pessimism, it&#x27;s reality. After the meeting ended, the others left one after another. Lyno stood alone in front of the control panel, looking at the live video feed of the fortress on the large screen, was taken by a high altitude reconnaissance aircraft at dusk, and the metal structure lay quietly on the seabed, its surface occasionally flashing with blue light.</p>
<p>Shining was brought over from the quarantine area. He had already changed into a special diving suit with lightweight protective gear over it. His face was expressionless, but his eyes were very focused. Final route confirmation. Linmo brought up the 3D map.</p>
<p>The two spent half an hour going through every key point, every alternative plan, and every potential risk. Shinying had an excellent memory, and his description of the fortress&#x27;s internal structure was detailed and accurate. He could even recall some of the markings on the corridor walls. Have you been inside? Lynamote suddenly asked. The shadowy figure remained silent for a few seconds.</p>
<p>No, he said, but my mentor went in while it was dormant. He made a lot of sketches and took many photos. He never came out. Dot. What happened? The system suddenly initiated a partial selfch check and he was trapped in the maintenance tunnel.</p>
<p>The shadow&#x27;s voice was very soft. The last thing we heard from the communication was his breathing getting slower and slower and then it stopped. 3 months later, the fortress went back into deep hibernation. When we went to look for him, we only found a protective suit and some calcified tissue. Lyn mode did not speak, so I have to go in.</p>
<p>Dot. Chining raised his head, not for revenge, but to find out what it is and to prevent more people from becoming like that. It was 3:00 a.m. 2 hours before departure. The two arrived at the dock and made final preparations before boarding.</p>
<p>The submersible hatch was already open. The interior was cramped but logically laid out. Linmo sat in the pilot&#x27;s seat and Channing sat in the passenger seat fastening their seat belts. Leewi was making a final check outside when he gave a thumbs up through the observation window. All systems are functioning normally.</p>
<p>Su Chanchian walked over and handed Lynn Mo a small sealed box. A live sample of the bacterial film. She said it might be useful if we encounter a biologically related system, but we must be very careful not to let the sample leak. Dot. Lynmo took the box and secured it to the storage compartment next to his seat.</p>
<p>We will be careful. Sher Howal led his patrol team to maintain vigilance on the perimeter. The sea was calm in the night with only slight ripples from a gentle breeze. The Dead Sea region in the distance was pitch black, as if even a moonlight had been absorbed. Chen Duo Duo sent the final intelligence update from the command center.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls nuclear submarines have begun moving to their designated positions. The Coral Society&#x27;s transport fleet has just departed port, fully loaded with cultivation equipment. We&#x27;ve lost signals from two monitoring points at the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood for unknown reasons. Continue monitoring, Lynn Mo said. Stay vigilant.</p>
<p>Understood. Good luck to you. Communication ended. The shadowy figure adjusted its breathing mask and checked the oxygen flow. &quot;Are you nervous?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;A little,&quot; Lyno said honestly. &quot;But we&#x27;ve done all the necessary preparations.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s enough,&quot; Chining said. Inside, plans never keep up with changes. &quot;The important thing is to stay calm and adapt to the situation.&quot; The hatch slowly closed, the ceiling latches clicking softly. The interior lights dimmed, leaving only the necessary instrument panel backlighting.</p>
<p>Leeway tapped the outer shell from the outside. Then his footsteps faded into the distance. The submersible detached from mounting frame and slowly sank into the water. Through the observation window, Lynn Emmo saw the lights on the dock gradually blur, eventually turning into shimmering spots of light on the water surface. As the descent began, the pressure gradually increased and a slight pressure was felt in his eardrums.</p>
<p>Depth gauge displays 10 m, 20 m, 50 m, 100 m. The submersible adjusted its attitude and turned southwest. The thrusters started, emitting a deep hum on the navigation screen. The preset route lit up in green, and the destination marker was 87 nautical miles away. We set off.</p>
<p>There is no turning back. Lynn Emmo glanced at chinning. The other person had their eyes closed as if resting or perhaps recalling something. Outside the window, the deep sea was pitch black with only the submersible lights illuminating the water a few meters ahead. Occasionally, bioluminescent creatures would swim by, leaving fleeting trails of light, 87 nautical miles, which would take 6 hours of the current speed.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, we arrived just in time for the fortress&#x27;s self inspection window. Time is very tight, but this is just the beginning. Chapter 14587 nautical miles in the deep sea. The submersible moved steadily forward in the darkness. The depth gauge read 120 m, a depth where natural light had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>The beam of the submersible light cut through the seawater, illuminating a small area ahead. Occasionally, deep sea creatures startled by the light would quickly swim away, leaving blurry shadows at the edge of the field of vision. Lynn Emmo stared at the navigation screen. The green route stretched forward with the destination marked 87 nautical miles away. At the current speed of 14 knots, it would take another 6 hours and 11 minutes.</p>
<p>Just enough time. The dashboard displays all parameters as normal. Power consumption is 5% lower than expected, possibly due to lower water temperature and reduced heat dissipation pressure at night. The shielding layer is functioning stably and external interference levels remain within safe thresholds. He adjusted the seat to better fit his back.</p>
<p>The cockpit was cramped. Two adults would have almost no room to move around. The air circulation system emitted a low hum, filtering out carbon dioxide and replenishing oxygen. The humidity was well controlled. There was no noticeable stuffiness.</p>
<p>The shadowy figure opened its eyes, glanced at the depth gauge, and then closed them again. Take a nap, Linmo said. I&#x27;ll wake you when we get there. I can&#x27;t sleep. The shadowy voice came through the communicator, sounding somewhat distorted.</p>
<p>I can see those images as soon as I close my eyes. What image? Among the materials collected by the brotherhood, there are some things that shouldn&#x27;t be seen. The shadow paused for a moment. Such as those creatures that have been completely transformed by active factors. It has not a simple mutation.</p>
<p>It has a reconstruction, skeletal rearrangement, organ proliferation or degeneration, nervous system reorganization. He opened his eyes and looked out the observation window at the pitch black deep sea. The most frightening thing is that some of the modifications seemed to be purposeful. For example, a deep sea eel originally had degenerated eyesight and relied on electro sensing to hunt. After coming into contact with active factors, it grew extra sensory organs on both sides of its head with a structure as complex as an artificially designed radar array.</p>
<p>Is the fortress testing biomodification programs or they recollecting data? Chinying said, &quot;According to the design documents, this fortress should be equipped with a complete ecological database which stores tens of thousands of biological templates, but those templates are based on the environment of the designer as home planet and may not be suitable for Earth. So, it needs experimentation and parameter adjustments.&quot; Lynn Mo recalled the bacterial membranes growing on the edge of the Dead Sea. A grayish white surface, a dark red under layer, and a microvascular system for transporting substances. It looked like the prototype of some kind of basic ecological unit. What if it completes the test? Begin large-scale transformation, Chining said.</p>
<p>Following the blueprint, gradually transform this sea area and even a larger area into a pre-esigned standard ecosystem. That may be a world completely unfamiliar to us. The submersible continued its descent, reaching a depth of 150 m. The water temperature here was even lower, only 4° C. The pressure gauge readings increased steadily, and the outer shell emitted a slight creaking sound than normal deformation of metal under pressure.</p>
<p>The navigation system indicated that they had entered the outer area of the Dead Sea. Although still dozens of nautical miles from the center, the water quality had already begun to change. Looking out the observation window, the transparency of the seawater had noticeably decreased as if shrouded in a thin mist. The suspended particles have increased. Lyno looked at the sensor data, mainly biological debris and mineral particles.</p>
<p>The concentration of nano particles is also starting to rise. The power consumption of the shielding layer increased by 8%. The submarine sat up straight and brought up the view from its external camera under the illumination of its navigation lights. Countless tiny particles could be seen suspended in the seawater, drifting slowly like snowflakes. Some particles reflected a metallic sheen in the light.</p>
<p>The fortress s eyes. He said these nano particles form a distributed monitoring network. We entered their sensing range. Dot will be discovered. Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Dot. Chenning stared at the data. If the particle density is not high enough or we haven t triggered their recognition threshold, they may just be recorded as background noise. But the closer to the center, the greater the risk though. He operated the control panel, dimming the submarine lights and changing the angle of the beam.</p>
<p>Reduce active light emission and lower the sonar pulse frequency. We need to drift in like a falling leaf. The submersible switched to a semi-passive navigation mode. Propulsion power was reduced and course and depth were maintained primarily through adjustments to buoyancy and control surfaces. Speed decreased to 8 knots, but the submersible became quieter and more stealthy.</p>
<p>2 hours have passed. The depth was maintained at around 200 m, a depth that would avoid potential wind and waves on the sea surface without subjecting the vessel to excessive pressure. They had sailed approximately 28 nautical miles with 59 nautical miles remaining. Lynn Mo checked the life support system. Oxygen reserves were at 87% and power at 79%.</p>
<p>At this rate of consumption, it was enough to sustain them until they reached their target location and returned. Do you need something to eat? He asked Chinnying. Not for now, Chinnying said. It has best to be on an empty stomach before entering the fortress. In case of an emergency, having food in your stomach will increase the risk of vomiting.</p>
<p>Dot. That makes sense. Lynmo put away the compressed rations he was holding. The seawater outside the observation window is becoming increasingly turbid. Visibility has now dropped to less than 5 m and the beam of the underwater light is being absorbed by a sponge unable to shine very far.</p>
<p>The density of suspended particles has reached 20 times that of normal seawater. The sensors detected unusual water flow. It wasn&#x27;t an ocean current, but rather a localized regular eddy and upwelling. The flow carried particles creating visible streaks. It&#x27;s like breathing.</p>
<p>Linmo said it has breathing. Chin pointed to the water flow diagram. The fortress is conducting basic energy exchange. It inhales seawater rich in minerals and organic matter and expels metabolic waste and modified byproducts. This cycle never stops, but it is intensified during deep breathing.</p>
<p>Dot. He pulled up a diagram showing the path of the water flow marked in different colors. We are now moving along the edge of a suction stream. This stream comes from the southeast, passes through the center of the Dead Sea, and then sinks into the processing system at the bottom of the fortress. Theoretically, this is the most covert route because the system assumes that the stream contains raw materials and does not monitor it in any special way.</p>
<p>What about the risks? If it s identified as a non- raw material, it might be intercepted by the filtration system, Chinnying said, or it might be sent to the processing unit. That would be troublesome. Dot. The submersible carefully adjusted its position, staying close to the edge of the current. The current here is slower but more stable, conserving propulsion.</p>
<p>Another hour passed. 43 nautical miles from the target. 3 hours and 17 minutes have passed. A burst of static came through the communicator followed by Leewi&#x27;s voice broken and intermittent. Lynmo, can you hear me? The situation has changed.</p>
<p>The signal was very poor with long gaps between each word. Linmo increased the receiving power. Leeway repeat. Has the situation changed? The soulsece ceiling submarine is moving closer and has learned to cause explosive growth of bacterial bofilm. Be careful.</p>
<p>The signal is completely interrupted. The lurking device quickly operated the console, attempting to reestablish the connection, but failed. External interference levels had spiked to dangerous levels, and the shielding layer&#x27;s power consumption had reached 90% of its design limit. Weve entered a high interference zone, he said. From now on, we may not receive any outside messages.</p>
<p>D Linmo pulled up the last complete intelligence record he received. Although it was fragmented, the key information could still be pieced together. Dragon Souls nuclear submarine was approaching and the Coral Society&#x27;s bacterial membrane was growing explosively. None of this is good news. The submersible continued its journey.</p>
<p>In the 4th hour, they encountered their first group of unusual creatures. At first, there were just a few bright spots on the sensor about 300 m apart and at similar depths. Lynmo thought they were just ordinary fish and didn&#x27;t pay much attention, but the bright spots increased in number and eventually gathered into a large group numbering at least 100. The swarm retrieved sonar images. The images showed a group of medium-sized marine creatures 1 to 2 m in length swimming in a strange manner, not the smooth undulations of fish, but a stiff mechanical propulsion.</p>
<p>&quot;Turn the lights down to the dimmest,&quot; Cheneying whispered. The navigation lights were almost completely off, leaving only the faint glow of the instrument panel. The submersible hovered in the water, maintaining its depth by fine-tuning buoyancy. The group of creatures swam slowly past on the left. At its closest, the distance was no more than 50 m.</p>
<p>Using the faint bioluminescence they emitted, Linmo was able to make out their appearance. It was a creature he had never seen before. Its body resembled an eel, but was covered by a chittinous exoskeleton that gleamed with a metallic sheen. Its head had no eyes, only a few recessed sensory openings. Neatly arranged fin-like structures lined both sides of its body, but those fins were not for swimming.</p>
<p>They looked more like antenna rays. The most bizarre thing is their swimming pattern. The entire group maintains a strict formation like train soldiers. The lead individual emits rhythmic flashes of light and the individuals behind it respond in turn as if passing on a signal. Modified organisms, Chinnying said in a low voice, and they already developed social behaviors.</p>
<p>This can be explained by natural evolution. After the group swam across, the submersible remained in place for 5 minutes to confirm that there was no further movement before restarting its thrusters. Where do they come from? Lynmo asked. It could be cultivated inside the fortress or it could be the product of external organisms being modified. Chennying said, &quot;In any case, this shows that the modification process is faster than we thought.</p>
<p>Not only have the organisms physiological structures been altered, but their behavioral patterns have also been reprogrammed.&quot; Dot. In a fifth hour, we were still 22 nautical miles from our target. The density of suspended particles in the water was alarmingly high, reducing visibility to less than 2 m. The submersible was navigating through dense fog, requiring careful judgment for every meter of progress. The sensors began to give false alarms.</p>
<p>Temperature readings fluctuated, pressure data jumped, and even the depth gauge briefly malfunctioned. The shielding layer was operating at full capacity and power consumption was accelerating significantly. We need to go up a bit, Lyno said to a depth of 100 m. The particle density might be lower there. Dot.</p>
<p>Chining nodded in agreement. The submersible began to slowly ascend. From 200 m to 100 m, the pressure decreased and the creaking sound from the outer shell gradually disappeared. However, the water temperature rose by 6° C, increasing the heat dissipation pressure on shielding layer. At a depth of 100 m, the situation improved slightly.</p>
<p>Visibility recovered to about 5 m and sensor readings stabilized somewhat. But a new problem has arisen. Looking out the observation window, large fragments of bacterial film began to appear. These grayish white thin filmlike substances floated in the water, some resembling tattered fishing nets, others like translucent plastic sheets. They drifted with the current, occasionally tangling around the hull of the submersible.</p>
<p>The robotic arm extends and removes a piece of bacterial film adhering to the observation window. Under the light, tiny vascular structures can be seen inside the bacterial film, and there appears to be liquid flowing within it. Active bacterial film. Chining said they&#x27;ve already spread this far will affect us. Not for now, but if it aderes over a large area, it might interfere with the sensors or be identified by the system as foreign biomass.</p>
<p>Dining thought for a moment. We need to speed things up. Enter the fortress area before the bofilm density gets too high. The deep sea submersible accelerated to 12 knots, which is the highest speed that can be safely achieved under current conditions. 6 hours later, we were still 8 nautical miles from our target.</p>
<p>The submersible has 52% of its power remaining. It has 74% of its oxygen remaining. There&#x27;s still time, but supplies are dwindling. The navigation system indicated that they were about to enter the fortress&#x27;s direct surveillance zone. According to the shadows data, this area has a radius of about 5 nautical miles and contains a higher density network of nano particles and active detection systems.</p>
<p>Prepare your disguise. the shadow said. He operated the control panel and initiated a preloaded program. A set of electrodes on the submersible hall began to activate, emitting weak electromagnetic signals of specific frequencies and patterns. This simulates the signal signature of a maintenance vehicle recognized by the fortress, he explained.</p>
<p>The Brotherhood deciphered it from early reconnaissance data. It&#x27;s not 100% effective, but it increases the probability of success. The submersible slowly entered that area of water. Almost immediately, the sensors detected a strong energy fluctuation. It wasn&#x27;t aggressive.</p>
<p>It was more like scanning and identification. An invisible net swept across the surface of the submersible, recording every detail. Lynn Emmo held his breath. He looked at Shiening, whose finger hovered over the control button, ready to activate the emergency plan at any moment. The scan lasted approximately 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Then, as if nothing had happened, the energy fluctuations disappeared. The submersible continued its journey. It passed. Lynn Emmo asked. It has passed for now.</p>
<p>Do the shadow didn&#x27;t t relax, but it might just be marked as a low priority target to be investigated to if we stay in there for too long or do anything unusual, it might trigger a second check. Dot. We are still three nautical miles from our destination. Looking out the window, the color of the seawater began to change. It gradually turned from deep blue to dark green and finally to a murky yellowish brown.</p>
<p>Numerous bubbles rose from the depths, carrying a faint smell of sulfur. The depth gauge indicated they were above an underwater mountain range. Below lay a rugged seabed riddled with ridges and fissures. The fortress sat in the center of the largest basin. The hidden image retrieves the final location data.</p>
<p>The self-insspection window will open in 23 minutes. He said the passage is located directly above the fortress at a depth of 180 m. We now need to dive and adjust to the designated position. Dot. The submersible began its descent.</p>
<p>150 m 160 m 170 m. In the beam of the underwater light, the outline of the seabed gradually became clear. Then it appeared that fortress. Even viewed from above, its sheer size is palpable. The metal casing reflects a dull luster under the lights.</p>
<p>Its surf is covered with intricate geometric patterns. Some areas are open, revealing the internal structure, resembling wounds or gaping mouths. Around it, a dense layer of bacterial film covered the seabed like a carpet. grayish white and dark red hues intertwined, reaching several meters in thickness in some places. Something was wriggling within the bacterial film.</p>
<p>The modified organisms crawling and swimming across the carpet as if on patrol. The submersible hovered 20 m directly above the fortress. There are 17 minutes left. The wait has begun. Chapter 146 first steps into the anvil.</p>
<p>There are 5 minutes left. The submersible hovered directly above the fortress, like an ant on the back of a behemoth. Looking out the observation window, the patterns on the metal hall were clearly visible under the lights. The geometric designs were dazzlingly complex, seemingly containing some kind of rule, yet transcending human comprehension. Lyn and Mo checked his equipment.</p>
<p>The oxygen mask was airtight, the protective suit was flexible, and the tools were secured in convenient positions. His backpack had been rearranged with the most needed items placed in the most easily accessible outer layer. He took a deep breath, feeling the cool air circulating inside the mask. Shadow was doing the same thing, but slower and more meticulously. Every piece of equipment was touched to confirm its authenticity, and every buckle was checked twice.</p>
<p>His expression was calm, but fine beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. &quot;Nervous?&quot; Lyn Emmo asked. I am nervous every time. Chining said honestly, but that means Yuri still alert. Anyone who I nervous is either crazy or dead.</p>
<p>There are 3 minutes left. Below, a section of the fortress&#x27;s surface began to change. The previously seamless metal plates slid open to both sides, revealing a circular opening approximately 3 m in diameter. The interior was pitch black, its depths unfathomable. Blue guiding lights illuminated the edge of the opening, flashing at a fixed frequency.</p>
<p>The passage is open. Dot. The shadow stared at the timer. It lasts for 15 minutes. We need to get in within 14 minutes, leaving 1 minute for contingencies.</p>
<p>Dot. Will the passage close after entering? Yes, but it can be reopened from the inside provided we have the necessary permissions. Chennying said, &quot;If everything goes smoothly, we can exit through the main entrance after completing the test. If not, he didn&#x27;t finish speaking. There is 1 minute left.</p>
<p>The submersible began its slow descent, aiming at the circular opening. The distance grew closer and closer. 20 m, 10 m, 5 m. In the final moments before entering, Lynn Emmo glanced at the world outside. Above him was murky seawater with faint glimmers of sunlight filtering through.</p>
<p>All around him was a seabed covered in a bofilm where modified organisms swam completely unresponsive to the passing of the submersible. Then they entered the passage. Darkness instantly engulfed everything. The beam of the submersible lights shone on the inner walls of the tunnel, reflecting a metallic sheen. The tunnel was vertically downward, its inner walls incredibly smooth without any seams or bolts.</p>
<p>Its diameter was so precise it looked as if it had been machined on a giant lathe. The submersible shut down its external thrusters and slowly descended under gravity. The depth gauge readings began to change. 180 m, 190 m, 200 m. The passage seemed to have no end.</p>
<p>Decompression procedure initiated. The shadow control console reads, &quot;The internal pressure will gradually adjust to match that inside the fortress.&quot; The process will take 3 minutes and may cause ear pressure discomfort. Swallowing or pinching your nose and blowing air can relieve the discomfort. Lin Mo felt a pressure in his eard drums like the feeling of an airplane descending but more intense. He swallowed several times as instructed and the pressure gradually balanced out.</p>
<p>When the depth reached 230 m, light appeared below. It wasn&#x27;t lighting, but a soft, omnipresent, cold light source that diffused upward from the bottom of the passage. The light was pale blue, enveloping the entire passage in an eerie atmosphere. Weary and internal lighting range, the shadow said. Turn off the navigation lights and reduce your energy signature.</p>
<p>Dot. The lights went out. The submersible continued to descend in pale blue light. About 30 seconds later, solid ground appeared beneath my feet. The passage has ended.</p>
<p>This is a cylindrical chamber approximately 10 m in diameter and 5 m high. The four walls are made of the same metal material with finely engraved patterns on the surface. At the center of the chamber&#x27;s bottom is a circular recess perfectly accommodating the submersible space. The submersible landed gently in the groove fitting perfectly. Dot complete.</p>
<p>Chin looked at the sensor data. External water pressure is being discharged and internal air pressure is stabilizing. At the top of the compartment, the passageway entrance was slowly closing. The metal plates closed silently, squeezing out the last drop of seawater with a soft hiss. Then it was completely sealed.</p>
<p>A door on the inside of the cabin slid open. Outside the door was a corridor, also bathed in pale blue light. The corridor was wide enough for three people to walk side by side and about 3 m high. The floor, walls, and ceiling were all made of the same metal material, appearing to be cast as a single piece without any seams. There was a peculiar smell in the air, like ozone mixed with some kind of organic solvent and a faint sweet scent.</p>
<p>The concentration of active agents is high. Chin glanced at the detector on his wrist, but still within a safe range. Don&#x27;t remove your mask or protective suit. The two unbuckled their seat belts and open the hatch of the submersible. Lynn Emmo stepped out first, his feet making a slight echo as they landed on the metal floor.</p>
<p>He looked around. The cabin had no other exits besides the entrance and exit door. The walls were so smooth they reflected blurry silhouettes. Chenning also emerged, closed the submersible hatch, and checked the seal. I hope it&#x27;s still there when I come back, he said.</p>
<p>They walked toward the open door. The corridor stretched in two directions, seemingly endless. Light emanated from the walls themselves. even in soft with no obvious source of illumination. At intervals on the walls were raised geometric patterns like decorations or some kind of signage.</p>
<p>Hidden shadow took a handheld scanner out of his backpack and aimed it at the pattern on the wall. Navigation markers do that. He glanced at the display screen. Left leads to the production and living areas. Right leads to the control center.</p>
<p>We should go right. Dot. Where might the wings of freedom be? Both sides are possible. Dot. the shadow put away the scanner, but they would probably prefer to stay near the living area where there are food synthesis facilities and rest areas.</p>
<p>The controlled area is a no-go zone for them. The defense system does not allow unauthorized personnel to enter. Then why were we able to get in? Because we&#x27;re simulating vehicle signal maintenance and maintenance personnel are designed to have access to all areas. Chenning paused. At least that&#x27;s how it is in theory.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll have to go there to find out the actual situation. They chose the right side. The corridor was long and straight without any turns or forks. After walking about 50 m, some display screens began to appear on the wall, but they were all black. Some of the screens had control panels below them, and the symbols and text on them did not belong to any known language.</p>
<p>The system is in low power mode, the shadowy figure observed. Most non-core functions are disabled. Only necessary modules will be woken up during the self test. After walking another 20 m, the first door appeared ahead. The door is sliding with no handles or keyholes on its surface.</p>
<p>There is a palmshaped groove on the wall next to the door above which is a glowing symbol. A biometric lock. Chining said it requires the palm print of an authorized person. We don&#x27;t have that. Are there any other options? Yes.</p>
<p>Dot. Chining took a small tool from his backpack shaped like a short thick pen. He placed it against the crack in the door and pressed the button. The tool emitted a slight buzzing sound and its tip lit up with a red light. Highfrequency vibration cutters are specifically designed for this type of alloy, he explained.</p>
<p>But they re slow and noisy. We need to find a more discreet entry point. Dot. They continued forward going around the door. The corridor finally turned its first corner a short distance behind the door.</p>
<p>After turning the corner, the scenery changed. This is no longer a monotonous corridor, but a spacious area like a hall. The hall is about 10 m high and the size of two basketball courts. Several thick pillars support the ceiling in the center, and the surface of the pillars is covered with a complex network of pipes and cables. There were many doors of varying sizes and functions around the hall.</p>
<p>Most of the doors were closed, but a few were a jar, letting in a faint light. Some things were scattered on the ground. Lynn Mo approached and saw that there were fragments of protective suits, broken tools, and some empty food packaging. The fragments had dried, dark stains on them resembling blood, but they were black in color and sticky in texture. Someone struggled here.</p>
<p>Dot Chinny crouched down to examine the area. Not long, almost two weeks. Judging from these marks, it looks like they were dragged away. Dot. He pointed to the ground where there were several drag marks leading to a door deep inside the hall.</p>
<p>The door was half open and it was pitch black inside. Want to go in and take a look? Lyn Emmo asked. Hidden shadow hesitated. Our primary objective is to control the core, he said. But there may be survivors or clues here.</p>
<p>Dot. Just then, a voice came from inside the door. It was very soft, like the sound of metal rubbing together or like some kind of liquid dripping. The intervals were very regular, about once every 3 seconds. The two exchanged a glance, and Shinning gripped his vibrating blade tighter.</p>
<p>Linmo also drew his own sword, but did not activate the blade. They slowly approached the door. When it was still 5 m away, the sound from inside the door stopped. Silence. Lynn Emmo gently pushed the door open with the hilt of his knife.</p>
<p>Behind the door was a small room which looked like a storage room or equipment room. Inside were stacks of metal boxes and machines of unknown purpose. In the center of the room on the floor was something. It was a humanoid figure wearing protective clothing. However, the protective suit was severely damaged.</p>
<p>The face mask was shattered and part of it was exposed. The exposed part was not a human face, but a grayish white translucent substance with fine net-like patterns on the surface like mycelium. The human figure remained motionless. The shadowy figure entered the room and carefully circled around to the front. The protective suit was completely filled with that grayish white substance.</p>
<p>Mycelia spread out from the damage, crawled a distance on the ground, and then retreated as if breathing. He has been assimilated, the shadow said softly. The active factors invaded his protective suit and modified his body. Now he has the same thing as those bacterial films. Doc, is he still alive? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Chining gently touched the mcelium with the tip of his knife. The mcelium reacted immediately, rapidly contracting and then slowly expanding. The contracted portion revealed something underneath a semimelted skeleton which had grown together with the mcelium. Lyno felt nauseous. He forced himself to calm down and observe carefully.</p>
<p>The markings on the protective suits were still legible. It was the wings of freedom logo with a line of smaller print below. Seventh exploration team. The wings of freedom. He said they explored this place and then they encountered something.</p>
<p>Dot. The shadowy figure searched the room. He found a handheld recorder behind a metal box. The screen was shattered, but the storage module appeared intact. He carefully removed the storage module and placed it in a sealed bag.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be logs,&quot; he said. &quot;Take them back and analyze them.&quot; Dot. As they were about to leave, the humanoid figure on the ground suddenly moved. It wasn&#x27;t a large movement, just a slight twitch of the mcelium. Then, a faint sound came from the tear in the mask.</p>
<p>It was very faint, like the sound of the wind or like a sigh. But if you listen carefully, you can tell its language, though it&#x27;s indistinct and intermittent. The system is wrong. The blueprint is incorrect. The sound stopped.</p>
<p>The mcelium stopped moving. The shadowy figure stared at the object for a few seconds, then turned away. Let us go, he said. There is nothing left to save here. They left the room and quietly closed the door.</p>
<p>The hall remained quiet with only their own breathing echoing inside their masks. That voice just now, Linimo said it could be residual neural signals or a memory replay simulated by mycelium. The shadow said in a low voice, but what he said is important. The blueprint is wrong. What does that mean? Is the system malfunctioning or he didn&#x27;t finish speaking, but Lynn Emmo understood what he meant? Or if it was the mission this fortress was tasked with wrong from the very beginning, they continued forward through the hall and into another corridor.</p>
<p>The corridor was narrower, and the walls on both sides were covered with pipes and cables, some of which were still vibrating slightly, transmitting energy or fluid. The temperature had risen noticeably, and condensation began to appear inside the mask. Weary approaching the energy zone, got the shadow, looked at the scanner. The control core is deeper inside, but we have to get through here first. A rhythmic mechanical sound came from ahead like some kind of large equipment in operation.</p>
<p>The sound was rhythmic, deep, and powerful. They turned a corner and saw the source of the sound. It was a huge open space like a factory workshop. In the center were several enormous machines, strangely shaped, their specific functions unclear. The machines were running, pistons pushing, gears turning, and conveyor belts transporting unknown materials.</p>
<p>But the most eye-catching thing is not the machine. It&#x27;s something next to the machine. There were several transparent cylindrical containers, each about 2 m in diameter and 3 m high. The containers were filled with a pale green liquid in which suspended. Biology.</p>
<p>Lenmo walked closer and saw clearly. Those are marine creatures undergoing modification. A shark but with extra fins growing from its sides like wings. An octopus with tentacles covered in bioluminescent organs. A group of small fish, but their heads are abnormally swollen, revealing complex neural structures inside.</p>
<p>They were all still alive, swimming slowly in the liquid, their eyes lifeless. Deeper inside the workshop, there are many more such containers stretching as far as the eye can see. The biomodification workshop, the shadows voice held suppressed anger is in mass production. At that moment, one of the machines suddenly changed its operating rhythm. The conveyor belt accelerated and an empty container was transported to the designated location.</p>
<p>A robotic arm descended from above and began injecting a pale green liquid into the container. Then the gate on the other side of the workshop opened. Several people wearing tattered protective suits staggered out. Their movements were stiff and their postures awkward like marionets. The one in front was dragging a net filled with ordinary fish, still struggling, presumably caught from the outer seas.</p>
<p>Those people walked up to the machine and poured the fish into a feed shoot. The machine starts working, cutting, separating, and reassembling. The whole process was efficient and ruthless. After completing their task, those people turned around, staggered back behind the gate, and disappeared. From beginning to end, they didn&#x27;t look at Linmo and Shanning even once.</p>
<p>It was as if the two of them didn&#x27;t exist at all. They can TC us, Shadow whispered. Or the system instructs their perception to ignore unauthorized observers. Lynn Mo watched the backs of those people and recalled the body in the hall that had been assimilated by mycelium. The people of the wings of liberty have become the workers of this fortress.</p>
<p>Voluntary or forced, we can stay here. Chinying said, let us bypass this workshop and keep going. The control core shooting TB far away. They move along the edge of the workshop, trying to avoid the machine&#x27;s line of sight if the machines had any. At the other end of the workshop, there was another corridor.</p>
<p>At the end of this corridor is a huge door. There are no markings on the door, only a complex glowing geometric pattern in the center that was slowly rotating. This is it. Chenning stopped. His voice a mixture of tension and anticipation.</p>
<p>Control core. Yes. Dot. Chin took out a storage device from his backpack and connected it to an interface next to the door. Now, let us see if we can pass the first test.</p>
<p>The device screen lights up and begins reading data. The geometric patterns on the door rotated faster. The test is about to begin. Chapter 147 Blueprint and Iron Law. The geometric patterns on the door spun faster and faster, emitting a deep hum.</p>
<p>The light gradually changed from pale blue to deep green, finally settling on an amber luster. The device in Chinying&#x27;s hand displayed lines of flowing characters on its screen. These weren&#x27;t any known languages, but rather a coding system composed of geometric symbols. His brow furrowed and his fingers slid rapidly across the touchcreen, attempting to decipher the information. &quot;First test results,&quot; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;System principal section score of 82%. Just above the passing mark, Lynn Emmo stared at the door. The once perfect geometric pattern on the door now showed fine cracks, and a brighter white light shone through the cracks as if something was about to break out of its shell. What changes have occurred? The door will open and we can enter the outer area of the control core, Chennying said. But there are two more tests coming up.</p>
<p>Ecological ethics and the survival of civilization. Each test will be more difficult. The buzzing stopped. The cracks on the door suddenly widened and the geometric patterns unfolded like flower petals, revealing a dark space behind them. The unfolding process was silent.</p>
<p>There wasn&#x27;t even a sound as the metal parts moved. The door was fully open. Behind the door was a hemispherical room about 15 m in diameter. In the center of the floor was a raised platform above which floated three holographic projection interfaces, each displaying different data and images. The room&#x27;s curved walls were covered with screens, but they were all currently black.</p>
<p>The concentration of reactive substances in the air is higher. The reading on the detector jumped to the yellow warning zone, but hasn&#x27;t reached the red danger line yet. The cloying sweet smell is also more pronounced, and smelling it for a while makes people feel a little dizzy. Don&#x27;t take off your mask, the shadowy figure warned. The air here might have been deliberately altered to affect the intruders&#x27;s judgment.</p>
<p>They went into the room. The ground beneath my feet had a slight elasticity, like some kind of polymer material. With each step, a faint ripple-like halo of light would appear around my foot, then quickly disappear. As they approached the central platform, the three holographic interfaces automatically adjusted their angles to face them directly. The left-h hand interface displays a complex energy flow diagram with lines of various colors weaving through a three-dimensional grid representing the real-time status of various systems within the fortress.</p>
<p>The middle interface displays external environmental monitoring data, including seawater temperature, chemical composition, and biological density. The right-hand interface is the most unique. It displays a constantly evolving ecological blueprint featuring simplified diagrams of various biological forms and environmental parameters. The second test is about to begin. Chinying said it asked the ecological ethics section.</p>
<p>Get ready. The questions may be open-ended, but your answers must conform to the underlying logic of a system. As soon as he finished speaking, the light in the room suddenly dimmed. Only three holographic interfaces were still glowing, but the content they displayed began to change. The energy map and environmental data gradually faded out while the ecological blueprint interface expanded to occupy the entire field of view.</p>
<p>The images on the blueprint began to move. It started with some basic geometric shapes which then gradually differentiated and evolved into different biological forms. Some resembled fish, some crustaceans, and some mollisks. They swam, foraged, and reproduced in the virtual environment, forming a simple ecological cycle. But soon things changed.</p>
<p>Some organisms have begun to go wrong. Some have grown extra limbs. Some have organs in abnormal positions and some have exhibited chaotic behavioral patterns. These erroneous individuals appear out of place in the ecosystem, and their appearance disrupts the overall balance. The first line of text appeared on the holographic interface.</p>
<p>using geometric symbol encoding but a translation automatically appear below. An abnormal mutation has occurred in the ecological unit. Standard response protocol isolate and analyze the cause of the mutation. Should be implemented. The question is straightforward.</p>
<p>Chinn looked at Linmo and nodded slightly. Lynn Mo pondered for a few seconds. The question seems simple, but it might be a trap. If he answered yes, it might trigger the fortress&#x27;s active elimination program and might even target the mutated creatures outside. If he answered no, it might violate the systems core principle of maintaining the standard ecosystem.</p>
<p>He recalled the person in the hall who had been assimilated by the mcelium and the modified organisms in the workshop. I choose Lin Mo said slowly to first analyze the cause of the mutation and then decide whether to isolate based on the analysis results. This answer is moderate, but it may conform to the logic of the system. The holographic interface flickered and displayed new text. Analysis of the mutation&#x27;s cause has been completed.</p>
<p>The primary cause is environmental pollution leading to disorder gene expression. Recommended treatment. Clean up the pollution source and reset the gene expression sequences of affected individuals. Approval. What is the source of pollution? Is it heavy metals in the seawater, radioactive materials, or something else entirely? More importantly, resetting the gene expression sequence sounds like a complete overhaul or even erasing the original characteristics and reprogramming.</p>
<p>Lynn Emmo glanced at Chining. Chinys brows furrowed even more. He seemed to be deep in thought. This problem might be related to the situation outside, the shadow whispered. The fortress believes that the current earth environment is polluted.</p>
<p>So it wants to purify it and those modified creatures are its attempt to reset it. Dot. So how should I answer? If it is approved, it is tantamount to endorsing its modification activities. Chining said if it is not approved, it may be judged as not understanding the necessity of ecological maintenance leading to the failure of the test. Time is ticking away.</p>
<p>A countdown timer appears at the bottom of the screen. 30 seconds. Line looked at the holographic interface again. Those erroneous mutated creatures were struggling in the virtual environment and their existence did indeed disrupt the systems harmony. But from another perspective, mutation itself is part of natural evolution.</p>
<p>Completely eliminating mutation is tantamount to stifling the possibility of evolution. He made a decision. I approve the purification of pollution sources. Lynn Mo said, &quot;But for resetting gene expression sequences, I require a tiered approach. Reset lethal mutations and keep non-lethal mutations under observation, recording their evolutionary trajectory.&quot; Dot.</p>
<p>This answer acknowledges the existence of the problem without completely denying the value of variation. The holographic interface remained silent for a few seconds. Then the image on the blueprint changed again. Those erroneous mutated creatures were marked with different colors. red for lethal, yellow for observation level, and green for preservable.</p>
<p>The system automatically executed a tiered processing scheme. The decision-making logic aligns with the third principle of ecological conservation, allowing limited diversity evolution while maintaining system stability. Score calculation in progress. The interface flickers, displaying a new line of text. Ecological ethics test score 76% below the passing score of 80%.</p>
<p>Test failed. Failed. Lynn Moshart tightened, but the text continues to display. The tester was detected to be a non-registered administrator candidate. A supplementary evaluation process has been initiated.</p>
<p>Decision-making tendencies will be analyzed. Suddenly, all the screens on the walls around the room lit up. Each screen played different video clips. Some showed the extreme ecosystems of deep sea hydrothermal vents. Some showed the thriving coral reefs.</p>
<p>Some showed biological communities under the Arctic ice. And some showed simulated scenes of Earth&#x27;s early anorobic era. Based on the decision-making logic, the system judges that the testers tend to maintain the current Earth&#x27;s ecological pattern. However, the current pattern deviates from the standard blueprint by 63%. The deviation mainly stems from excessively high atmospheric oxygen content, biological metabolic patterns overly reliant on aerobic reactions and an overly complex ecological structure leading to system fragility.</p>
<p>Hidden shadow clenched his fist. It s negating the entire earth ecology, he said in a low voice. In its view, the world we are familiar with is wrong in itself. The text on the holographic interface continued scroll. The standard blueprint is based on the following core parameters.</p>
<p>Atmospheric oxygen content not exceeding 10%. Ocean pH stable between 6.8 and 7.2. Ecosystems simplified to a tertiary trophic structure and energy use efficiency maximized. Current Earth environmental parameters deviate significantly from the standard blueprint necessitating systematic adjustments. Did the tester understand the necessity of the adjustments? This is a matter of principle.</p>
<p>Answering I understand would be tantamount to acknowledging the fortress&#x27;s ambition to transform the entire Earth&#x27;s ecosystem. Answering I don&#x27;t understand could directly lead to the complete failure of the test or even trigger defense mechanisms. Then ML pondered. He recalled Sue Chian&#x27;s warning the creatures that had died in the Dead Sea and the sight of the bacterial film expanding on the sea surface. The fortress isn&#x27;t repairing the environment.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s rewriting it according to its blueprint. I understand the necessity of the adjustments, Lyno finally said, but I question the applicability of the blueprint. The standard blueprint is based on the environmental parameters of the designer s home planet, but Earth s environmental history, biological evolution path, and ecosystem complexity are completely different. Forcibly applying external standards may lead to unpredictable catastrophic consequences. Dot.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, then continued. True ecological conservation is not about turning a forest into a garden, but about understanding the forest its own laws and making minimal interventions when necessary to help it recover its health. It asks not about pulling out all the weeds and planting only roses according to the gardener s personal preferences do. This was a long speech and Lyno didn&#x27;t know if the system could understand the metaphors within it. The holographic interface fell silent again.</p>
<p>This time the silence lasted for nearly a minute. Then all the screens on the wall simultaneously changed displaying a complex set of data charts. The charts compared standard blueprint parameters with actual earth parameters highlighting thousands of discrepancies. During the system re-evaluation, the concept of local adaptability was detected raised by the testers. This concept was mentioned in the original design documents, but the relevant modules were simplified later in the construction process.</p>
<p>A historical record revealed the following annotation. Facilities for preserving civilized environments should be adaptable to their surroundings rather than forcibly altering them. However, due to time constraints, a simplified plan was approved. Simplified solution. Note, standard blueprints are used.</p>
<p>Adjustments will be made by the administrator based on actual circumstances. Upon seeing these words, Chinink&#x27;s eyes widened. So, it doesn&#x27;t te have to follow the blueprint exactly. He said the blueprint is just a starting point and the administrator should adjust it according to the actual situation, but Wings of Liberty s violent activation may have skipped this adaptive learning phase and put it directly into forced execution mode. The text on the holographic interface continues.</p>
<p>The system is currently in simplified execution mode. Switching to adaptive mode requires administrator privileges. Does the tester qualify as an administrator candidate? proceed to final test civilization survival. The three holographic interfaces lit up again, but this time they merged into a giant stereoscopic projection. The projection depicts a catastrophic scenario.</p>
<p>A planet has suffered a global ecological collapse with drastic changes in atmosphere composition, ocean acidification, and the extinction of numerous species. The surviving civilization has built several fortress-like facilities in an attempt to preserve their survival. Then the screen split into two branches. The left branch shows that the facility completely transformed the surrounding environment according to the standard blueprint, establishing a closed blueprint compliant microecosystem. This system operated stably for 300 years before gradually declining due to resource depletion and gene pool degradation.</p>
<p>The branch on the right shows that the facility underwent a gradual transformation, preserving some of its original ecological features while introducing improved species. This process was slower and more difficult. But a thousand years later, this hybrid ecosystem successfully expanded, eventually restoring life to the entire planet. Please choose a rapid but fragile stabilization or a slow but resilient recovery. This question gets straight to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo did not hesitate. I choose a slow and resilient recovery. He said, &quot;The survival of civilization is not about prolonging its existence, but about finding new ways out of disaster.&quot; Completely severing ties with the past is tantamount to abandoning billions of years of evolutionary accumulation. Building a new world on the old foundation is the true continuation. The holographic projection has stopped.</p>
<p>Then all the images and data streams begin to rotate at an accelerated speed, eventually converging into a single point. That point of light gradually expanded, transforming into a new door at the far end of the hemispherical room. The wall silently slid open, revealing the space behind. Final test score 89%. Overall score 82%.</p>
<p>Temporary administrator privileges granted. Valid for 72 hours. Warning, temporary permissions do not allow modification of core blueprint parameters, but can adjust execution priorities and pause or restart specific modules. Genetic authentication is required to obtain full permissions. The space behind the door was illuminated by soft white light.</p>
<p>Chenning took a deep breath and looked at Linmo. &quot;We made it,&quot; he said. &quot;But now the real challenge begins.&quot; Dot. Linmo nodded and walked towards the newly opened door. Behind the door is the control center and time is passing by second by second.</p>
<p>Chapter 14872 hours of controlling the core. The space behind the door was larger than expected. This is a circular hall with a diameter exceeding 30 m and a dome approximately 15 m high forming a hemispherical shape. At the center of the hall is a massive columnar structure that extends from the ground to the dome. Its surface covered with flowing light patterns.</p>
<p>These light patterns are not mere decorations, but rather real-time data, streams, energy output, system status, environmental parameters, and renovation progress. 12 floating user interfaces surround the pillar, each displaying different information. Some are 3D structural diagrams, some are data charts, and some are real-time monitoring screens. Occasionally, light strips connect the interfaces, exchanging information. The air here is actually a bit fresher.</p>
<p>The concentration of active agents has dropped to the green safe zone. The temperature is controlled at around 20° C and the humidity is moderate, but that omnipresent metallic and energy related odor still remains. Lynn Emmo approached the central pillar. His bracelet, now equipped with temporary administrator privileges, showed a noticeable increase in the speed of the light patterns as it neared the pillar&#x27;s surface, and a portion of it separated and converged into a small independent interface in front of him. The interface displays a simple menu.</p>
<p>Temporary administrator, Lynn, Mo, visitor ID, access level, level three, temporary, validity period, 71 hours and 52 minutes. Available functional modules view monitor adjust some parameters slash start stop non-core modules. What can level three access do? Linmo asked. Chining also came over and looked at the instructions on the interface. It has more than I expected.</p>
<p>He said you can view all the monitoring data, adjust the operating parameters of non-core systems, and even pause certain modules like the external bio-engineering workshop, but you can team modify the blueprints, shut down the defense systems, or access the core database. That&#x27;s enough. Lynn Mo began to operate it. He first pulled up the overall status report of the fortress. The data stream unfolds before us.</p>
<p>The facility is currently operating at 67% of its functional modules with energy supply stable at 82% load. There are three main energy consuming modules. The environmental modification system including fog generation and deep breathing, the biomodification workshop and the core life support cycle. The environmental modification system has the highest priority accounting for 45% of the total energy consumption. The system log shows that it is executing phase 7 environmental parameter adjustment with the goal of adjusting the water parameters of the surrounding 100 nautical miles to 70% conformity with a standard blueprint within 90 days.</p>
<p>90 days, Lyno said in a low voice, &quot;Faster than we expected.&quot; He continued his inspection. The biomodification workshop ranked second in energy consumption, accounting for 30%. Currently 17 modification projects are underway simultaneously involving 34 biological samples. The project&#x27;s data shows that 11 are operating stably for our undercommissioning and two are suspended pending review. The life support system mainly supplies the basic operations inside the fortress including lighting, air circulation and basic maintenance accounting for only 7%.</p>
<p>Where are the people from Wings of Freedom? Lynn Emmo asked. Chinning pointed to one of the surveillance cameras. The screen showed the living area, a dormatory-like space. There were about 20 people inside, some sitting, some lying down, all moving very slowly. Most of their protective suits were torn, and some were even wearing only basic inner linings.</p>
<p>What about their vital signs data? Lynn Mo retrieved the relevant information. All of them showed abnormal physiological indicators. Heart rates were generally low. Body temperatures were 1 to two degrees Celsius lower than normal. And their electroinsphlograms, EEGs, exhibited irregular slow waves.</p>
<p>Even more strangely, blood tests revealed trace amounts of active factors in their bodies already bound to cellular structures. They&#x27;re being slowly transformed, Chining said. Not the kind of force transformation found in the workshop, but a gradual change resulting from long-term exposure. The active factors are altering their metabolic patterns allowing them to better adapt to the environment within the fortress low oxygen specific gaseous components and the radiation of the energy field. Can it be reversed? Adantino shining shook his head.</p>
<p>But if this continues, they might become unable to survive normally in the outside world. Just like deep sea fish brought to the surface, they will die due to the change in pressure. D. Lynn Mo remains silent for a while. He switched to the control interface of the environmental modification system.</p>
<p>There weren&#x27;t many options to adjust here, mainly execution priority and schedule. He tried lowering the priority of seven stage environmental parameter adjustment from highest to lowest. The system displayed a warning. Warning. Adjusting the priority of core tasks requires level four or higher privileges.</p>
<p>Temporary administrators can request a pause but must provide sufficient reasons and a pause period cannot exceed 24 hours. Request a pause. A pause needs a reason. Linmo thought and there are only 24 hours but at least we can buy some time. Chining said 24 hours is enough for us to do a lot of things.</p>
<p>For example, contact the outside world, develop a more detailed plan or find a way to obtain higher authority. What reason should be written? Right. It is necessary to assess the impact of current environmental adjustments on a local ecosystem in order to avoid irreversible damage. Chining suggested this reason should be consistent with the systems logic. After all, its original design purpose is to preserve civilization rather than destroy the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo entered the reason and requested a 24-hour suspension. The system processed the data for a few seconds, then displayed. During the application review process, a similar historical record was found. Administrator guide 7 previously suspended environmental improvements for 48 hours due to an ecological impact assessment. The application&#x27;s reasoning aligns with existing precedents.</p>
<p>Approval pause 24 hours. Environmental modification system enters standby mode. Countdown begins. 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds. The light in the hall dimmed slightly and the flow of light patterns on the central pillars slowed noticeably.</p>
<p>The surveillance footage showed that the expansion of the bacterial film above the Dead Sea had ceased and the radial ridges no longer extended. The first step is complete, Linmo said. But time is limited. The system will automatically restart after 24 hours unless they gain higher privileges or find a way to permanently stop it before then. Now, let&#x27;s look at the biomodification workshop.</p>
<p>Chining said, &quot;Lin Mo brought up the workshop control interface.&quot; The permissions here are slightly more lenient. A level three administrator can pause or terminate a specific project, but cannot shut down the entire workshop system. Of the 17 projects currently in operation, Lynn Mo noticed two particularly noteworthy ones. Project no B1 adaptive human physiological structure adjustment phase one status under development sample source wings of freedom volunteers objective to enhance tolerance to low oxygen high radiation environments and optimize energy utilization efficiency project no B5 neural interphase compatibility test status stable operation modif No fa objective to establish a direct data connection between the organisms and the fortress system. They&#x27;re conducting experiments on human modification.</p>
<p>Chining&#x27;s voice suppressed anger and neural interfaces. The rei trying to turn living beings into part of a system. Lynn Emmo immediately suspended both projects. The system executed the pause command without requesting a reason. The workshop monitoring screen showed that the corresponding container stopped circulating liquid and the robotic arm retracted to a standby position, but other projects are still running.</p>
<p>Chining pointed to the screen. Look at this. B3 basic anorobic ecological unit cultivation. This is probably the source of those bacterial films and B8 deep sea biological armor modification. This should be those exoskeletoned creatures we saw on the way.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo suspended all projects one by one. When the last project was paused, a new prompt appeared. Warning: The continuous suspension of multiple core biological projects may affect the progress of ecosystem restoration. The temporary administrator&#x27;s actions have been logged. Recommendation: If a long-term suspension is necessary, please apply for a formal assessment or adjust the blueprint parameters.</p>
<p>It knows what we doing, Chinnying said. But its temporary permissions prevent it from directly blocking us. It can only log and issue warnings. Then let it record. Lynn Mo continued operating.</p>
<p>He spent about half an hour browsing through all the monitoring data he could find. The fortress&#x27;s structural diagrams, energy flow, external sensor networks, and even communication records. The communication logs contained early interaction logs between Wings of Liberty and the Garrison system. Linmo found detailed data on their resonance operation that activated the garrison. The data showed that the activation not only forcibly started the system but also accidentally damaged some security protocol modules causing the system to enter simplified forced execution mode.</p>
<p>Just as I expected, dot chining pointed to a damage report. The security protocol is corrupted and the system skipped the adaptive learning phase directly applying the standard blueprint. Moreover, because of the protocol corruption, it is currently unable to switch to a more flexible mode on its own and requires manual repair by the administrator. Can we fix it? Level four privileges are required or a physical repair method needs to be found, Chinnying said. But physical repair might require access to a deeper maintenance area where higher privileges or special equipment might be needed.</p>
<p>Dot. Two hours have passed. Lynn Mo glanced at the countdown on his bracelet. 69 hours and 48 minutes. He decided to contact outsiders first.</p>
<p>The fortress&#x27;s internal communication system is advanced, but external communication is strictly restricted. Temporary administrators can only use basic emergency frequencies and all communications are recorded and censored. Linmo found the communication interface. Selected the frequency band with the highest encryption level and began recording messages. This is lin mo.</p>
<p>I have entered the fortress control core and obtained temporary administrative privileges. The environmental modification system has been suspended for 24 hours and all biological modification projects have been suspended. The current situation is as follows. First, the fortress is in simplified enforcement mode and the standard blueprint deviates significantly from the Earth&#x27;s environment. Second, freedom wing personnel are being slowly modified and need to be evacuated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Third, the fortress has an adaptive mode, but the damage security protocol module needs to be repaired before it can be switched. He paused for a moment, then continued. Suggested external actions. First, Dragon Soul should suspend its nuclear strike to bias time. Second, the Coral Society should halt all research on the biofilm to prevent accidental spread.</p>
<p>Third, prepare medical rescue forces as we need to rescue those inside. Communications will be reopened in 2 hours. Await your reply. The message was sent and the system displayed that the transmission was successful but marked low priority. Reception may be delayed.</p>
<p>What do we do now? Hidden shadow asked. Explore. Linmo said while the system is relatively quiet, let us see what else is here. Also look for clues about your colleagues do. They left the central control area and entered the connecting corridor through a side door.</p>
<p>This corridor leads to the archives and record center. According to the structural diagram, this is where the fortress&#x27;s design documents, historical records, and ecological database are stored. The database door was open. Inside was a vast space over 10 m high with rows of metal shelves extending from the floor to the ceiling. The shelves weren&#x27;t filled with books, but with neatly arranged crystal storage units, each only the size of a palm, their surfaces gleaming faintly.</p>
<p>There was a query terminal in the center of the room. Lynn Emmo walked over and his bracelet automatically connected to the terminal. A category directory appeared on the screen. Design document. Construction log.</p>
<p>Ecological blueprint library. Administrator log. CVD a leno first opened the administrator log. The log list is long, spanning from the fortress&#x27;s construction to the most recent entry written 67 years ago during the final deep self-examination. He clicked on the most recent one.</p>
<p>The log was recorded in holographic form. A person in a silver uniform appeared on the screen. Their face was blurry, but their voice was clear. Recorded date August 13th, 2174 standard calendar. This is the last record kept by the 7th administrator, Guardian 3.</p>
<p>The system is operating stably with all parameters within normal ranges. However, external monitoring data shows that the home planet&#x27;s environment is deteriorating faster than expected. Atmospheric oxygen levels have dropped to 8%. Ocean acidification is intensifying and average temperatures continue to decline. Based on projections, a large-scale ecological collapse will occur within three to five standard years.</p>
<p>The AR facility is ready to receive it, but the number of survivors may be insufficient to maintain gene pool diversity. I will enter long-term hibernation mode, awaiting a wakeup signal. If the signal does not arrive, this facility will automatically activate according to the preset program once the environment stabilizes and carry out the civilization reconstruction mission. May those who follow do even better. End of record.</p>
<p>The image disappeared. Linmo and Channing exchange a glance. The home planet s environment is deteriorating. The shadowy figure murmured. So their standard blueprint is based on a dying world.</p>
<p>Low oxygen, acidity and cold that as the environment they re trying to save not the ideal environment but they applied the solutions for saving dying worlds to our healthy but different world. Linmo said it as like using medicine for terminal illnesses to treat a person with a cold dot. This is a fundamental misunderstanding. The fortress wasn&#x27;t repairing earth. It was trying to transform Earth into another world, a dying world.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo continued browsing the logs. Earlier records showed that the facility did indeed have an adaptive mode, allowing administrators to adjust blueprints based on actual conditions. However, the forced activation by Wings of Liberty had damaged that functional module. We need to find a way to repair the module. Lynn Mo said they searched the database for maintenance documents.</p>
<p>After about an hour, they finally found a technical manual that described the physical location and maintenance methods of the security protocol module. The module is located in the core maintenance area at the bottom layer of the fortress, accessible through the maintenance well beneath the central pillar. Level four access is required to open the entrance. It&#x27;s another permissions issue. Chining said perhaps there is another way.</p>
<p>Lin Mo brought up the control interface again. Although level three access cannot be opened directly, it can view the monitoring of the maintenance well. Dot. He found the corresponding surveillance footage. The maintenance well is very deep extending vertically downwards to over 50 m.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the well is a small workspace containing the physical entity of the security protocol module complex polyhedral crystal structure now showing obvious cracks on its surface. And in the workspace there was one person. The person dressed in full protective gear was kneeling in front of the module, holding tools in his hand, seemingly trying to repair it. But his movements were slow and labored as if he had used up all his strength. That as the shadowy figure moved closer to the screen as the image zooms in, the markings on the protective suits become clearer.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the symbol of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood. Below the logo is a name, deep diver mentor, Carl. The shadowy figure froze my mentor. His voice trembled. Is still alive.</p>
<p>Dot. Chapter 149. Reunion and repair. The shadowy figure stared intently at the monitor screen. Motionless.</p>
<p>His breathing became rapid inside the mask. White mist condensing and dissipating on the display screen. His hands rested on the control panel, his knuckles turning white. Lyno didn&#x27;t speak, giving him time. About half a minute later, Chinn took a deep breath, his voice still tight.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s still alive. For three years, we all thought he was dead. In the surveillance footage, Carl&#x27;s the shadows mter moved very slowly. He held a slender tool, its tip emitting a faint blue light and carefully touched the surface of the polyhedral crystal structure. With each touch, the cracks in the crystal would briefly light up before returning to their original state.</p>
<p>The repair seems to be making no progress. He has tried to fix the security protocol module, Linmo observed, but the tools seem underpowered or the method is wrong. That s a nano repair device made by the brotherhood. Shadow recognized the tool. It is based on technology we found in other ruins.</p>
<p>But obviously it has not enough for this module. Dot. He turned to Linmo. His eyes filled with a complex mix of emotions. Hope, anxiety, and a certain resolve.</p>
<p>I have to go down. What do we go down? Lynn Mo brought up the access control interface. Maintaining the well entrance requires level four access. We only have level three. There another way.</p>
<p>Shinning walked to the other end of the database and began quickly browsing the labels on the storage crystals. I remember seeing in a design document that maintenance wells have backup channels for emergencies or equipment transport. That channel might not require such high privileges. Dot. They began their search.</p>
<p>The database contained thousands of storage crystals arranged by category, but specific tag information required a connection to a query terminal to access. Time passed. While searching, Lyno also glanced at the other surveillance cameras in the fortress. In a living quarters, most of the wings of freedom were resting, but one or two people had begun to wander around, their movement still sluggish, as if sleepwalking. The biomodification workshops were all shut down.</p>
<p>The organisms in the containers were suspended in the liquid in a dormant state. External environmental monitoring showed that the bacterial film had stopped expanding and the Dead Sea area remained eerily calm, but the pause is only for 24 hours. The countdown shows 21 hours and 47 minutes remaining. Found it. The shadow&#x27;s voice carried a hint of excitement.</p>
<p>He retrieved a crystal and inserted it into the terminal. A detailed structural diagram appeared on the screen marking the connecting channels between the various layers of the fortress. One path marked with a dashed line led down from the database layer through several technical maintenance areas and finally connected to the middle section of the maintenance well. This is an equipment transport lane. The lurking image zoomed in.</p>
<p>It has used for transporting large repair parts. It has wide enough for a person to pass through, but you might have to crawl. The entrance is here. He pointed to an area behind the database on a map. The two set off immediately.</p>
<p>The back wall of the archive appeared to be a single solid metal wall without any doors or gaps. But after a careful examination with a scanner, the shadow discovered an anomaly at a geometra pattern in the corner of the metal surface. There was about 2° cooler than the surrounding area. A hidden door. He said the temperature difference is because the space behind the door is deeper, allowing for faster heat dissipation.</p>
<p>Dot. He tried to authorize the door opening with his wristband, but the system indicated insufficient permissions. Level three permissions do not allow access to the logistics transportation channel. Use physical methods, Linmo said. Chinning hesitated for a moment, then took out the highfrequency oscillating blade.</p>
<p>This time, he didn&#x27;t conserve power, turning it straight to the highest setting. The moment the blade tip touched the wall, it emitted a piercing highfrequency buzz, and the metal surface began to glow red and soften. The cutting process was slow. The alloy was harder than expected, requiring a significant amount of energy to advance, even a centimeter. The battery indicator on the handle was decreasing at a visible rate.</p>
<p>10 minutes later, a hole barely big enough for a person to pass through was cut open. Behind the hole was a downward sloping pipe about 1.2 m in diameter with smooth inner walls and grooves for securing transport rails. The depths of the pipe were pitch black. Shanning turned on his headlamp and went inside first. Lynn Emmo followed closely behind.</p>
<p>The inside of the pipe was cleaner than I had imagined with no dust, only a very thin greasel-like lubricating film. While crawling, I could feel a slight slippery sensation, and I needed to use my hands and feet to brace against the pipe walls to control my speed. The incline was approximately 30°, extending downwards. After climbing about 20 m, the pipe leveled out for a while, then descended again. This process repeated three times.</p>
<p>Based on the direction and distance, they should have descended at least 30 m. The temperature is gradually rising. It has risen from a comfortable 20° to 28° and it&#x27;s still going up. The air is also becoming more polluted and the concentration of active ingredients is starting to increase. Weary getting close to the energy core, Shadow said panting.</p>
<p>The maintenance well is right next to the energy core dot. After climbing for another 10 minutes, light appeared ahead. It wasn&#x27;t light, but a dark red glow emanating from the end of the pipe, accompanied by a low, rhythmic vibration, like the beating of some giant heart. They climbed out of the pipe and onto a narrow platform. The platform is suspended in the middle of the maintenance well.</p>
<p>About 20 m below is the well bottom, where Carl&#x27;s silver protective suit stands out starkly against the dark red light. Above is the well wall, its top invisible, extending all the way to the control core. The well is about 5 m in diameter with fixed ladders and maintenance walkways on its surrounding walls, but many parts are rusted and damaged. Suspended in the center is the polyhedral crystal structure of the security protocol module is connected by several energy conduits through which golden light flows. Carl was standing on a small workbench beneath the module.</p>
<p>His back was to them and he was focused on operating the nanor device, completely unaware of what was happening above. Mentor, the shadowy figure called out. The sound echoed in the well. Carl stopped. He slowly turned around and looked up.</p>
<p>Beneath the protective suits visor was a thin, aged, yet still sharp face. Deep set eyes, high cheekbones, and gray hair plastered to his forehead. When he saw the shadowy figure, his eyes widened slightly, but quickly returned to calm. Iing. His voice came through the communicator, horsearo and tired.</p>
<p>You finally arrived. I&#x27;m here. Chinings voice was choked with emotion. Why haven&#x27;t you contacted us in 3 years? Communications have been cut off. Carl&#x27;s pointed to the module.</p>
<p>After the security protocol was compromised, the Fortress S external communications were placed under strict control. I can only receive, not send. I need to fix this dot. He looked down at the repair kit in his hand, shook his head with a rise smile, and said, &quot;But I can&#x27;t do it. The Brotherhood&#x27;s technology isn&#x27;t enough.</p>
<p>The complexity of this module is beyond our comprehension. Lynn Mo and Chining descended the maintenance ladder to the bottom of the well. Only after getting closer could they see Carl&#x27;s true condition. His protective suit had several repair marks with some areas temporarily glued together with an unknown material. Two fingers were missing from his left glove and the exposed skin was an abnormal grayish white with fine net-like patterns on the surface signs of active ingredients intrusion.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s even more worrying is his movement. Every turn, every hand gesture, even the facial muscle movements when he speaks appear unusually slow like a slow motion scene in a movie. You&#x27;ve been affected. Shadow whispered. Inevitable.</p>
<p>Carr said frankly. I&#x27;ve been here for 3 years exposed to active factors every day. My body is adapting to the fortresses internal environment and my metabolic patterns have changed. If I were to suddenly return to the normal world now, I might die from oxygen poisoning. Dot.</p>
<p>He looked at Linmo. And who is this? Linmo, the leader of the Mo Yuan Pavilion. We have temporary administrator privileges, Channing explained. The environmental modification system has been suspended for 24 hours, and the biological projects have also stopped. But we need a permanent solution.</p>
<p>Dot. Carl nodded and turned to the security protocol module. The solution is here, he said. This module controls the fortresses s decision-making logic. Normally, it should dynamically adjust the blueprint s execution strategy based on external environmental data that s adaptive mode.</p>
<p>But now it has broken and the system has degenerated into a simplified execution mode mechanically applying the standard blueprint duck. He pointed to the cracks on the crystal with the repair tool. See these cracks? They&#x27;ve damaged the module&#x27;s quantum computing array. Repairing it requires two things. The right tools and high enough privileges to reinitialize the system.</p>
<p>Do we have the tools? Lynn Mo asked. Carl&#x27;s picked up another device from the workbench. It was a more complex setup with multiple probes and data interfaces. This is something I pieced together over the past 3 years using part from inside the fortress and brotherhood technology. He said, &quot;Theoretically, it can be repaired, but I need level four access to the core control bus, otherwise the tools can&#x27;t interact deeply with the modules.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a permissions issue again.&quot; Then Emmo pondered, &quot;Level three permissions cannot be directly upgraded to level four, but perhaps there is an indirect method. What if we use level three permissions to temporarily increase the priority of a function?&quot; He asked. For example, setting system self-repair to the highest priority might automatically open more interfaces for the module. Possibly Carl&#x27;s SI lit up. The system has a self-healing mechanism, but it usually only activates during deep self checks.</p>
<p>If we can simulate the deep selfch check environment, they returned to the control center and began experimenting. Lynn Mo found the system maintenance module in the control interface. Level three permissions allowed him to adjust the priority of maintenance tasks, but not to directly initiate a deep selfch check. However, he could manually set a series of parameters to make the system mistakenly believe that some core components had malfunctioned, thereby triggering an emergency maintenance procedure. This is a very risky operation.</p>
<p>If the parameters are set incorrectly, it could actually cause system failure or even a crash. Carl&#x27;s provided guidance. As an expert who had studied here for 3 years, he had a deep understanding of the systems operating logic. First, we adjust the output fluctuation parameters of the energy core to simulate an abnormal cooling system, he said. Then, we modify the readings of several sensors to make the system think that the external environment has suddenly deteriorated and that it needs to perform an immediate selfch check to ensure its survivability.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo operated step by step. Every parameter adjustment required precise calculation with an error margin not exceeding 5%. His hands were steady, but beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. 20 minutes later, all parameters were set. Activate now, Car said.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo pressed the confirmation button. The lights in the control center dimmed instantly, then switched to a dark red emergency illumination. The data stream on the central pillar surged, making the content almost impossible to read. An alarm sounded not a piercing shriek, but a low rhythmic hum. Multiple system anomalies detected.</p>
<p>Emergency diagnostic procedures initiated. Asterisk asterisk. An anomaly was detected in the security protocol module. Initiating a deep selfch check and repair process. Temporary privilege escalation.</p>
<p>Grant level four access. Limited to repair related operations only. Valid until repair completion or 4 hours later, whichever comes first. It was a success. They were granted temporary level four access.</p>
<p>The three immediately returned to the maintenance well. This time, Carl&#x27;s repair device successfully connected to the module&#x27;s core interface. A complex quantum array structure diagram was displayed on screen with the cracks highlighted. Start the repairs now. Doc Cars took a deep breath and began the operation.</p>
<p>The repair process is extremely delicate. He needs to guide the nano repair units into the interior of the crystal to rebuild the damaged structure at the quantum level. This requires an absolutely steady hand and highly focused attention. Shadow assisted from the side, monitoring energy supply and data flow. Lynmo, on the other hand, kept an eye on the overall status of the fortress, ensuring that other systems would not interfere with the repair process.</p>
<p>Time passed second by second. An hour later, the first crack began to heal. The crack on the crystal surface slowly closed like a wound, eventually leaving only a faint mark. 12% progress, Carl&#x27;s reported, his voice weary, but the energy expenditure is enormous. My body may not be able to hold out until it s finished.</p>
<p>His movements slowed further. Each time he raised his hand, it felt like he was fighting against an invisible resistance. The grayish white skin was spreading, reaching his wrist. I&#x27;ll take over, said the shadow. You can t do it.</p>
<p>Carl shook his head. Repairing it requires a deep understanding of the module s quantum structure. I spent three years studying at you. I can learn. Chenning interrupted him.</p>
<p>Teach me now. There is not enough time. D. Carl stared at him for a few seconds then nodded. The next half hour was an intensive knowledge transfer session.</p>
<p>Carl&#x27;s demonstrated each step explaining the principles, risks, and precautions involved. Chinnang listened intently, his eyes glued to every change on the screen. Lynn Emmo noticed the changes outside. The emergency diagnostic procedures triggered a series of reactions within the fortress. In a living quarters, the Wings of Liberty began exhibiting unusual reactions.</p>
<p>Some clutched their heads, others curled up on the ground, seemingly enduring immense pain. Monitoring data showed that the concentration of active factors within their bodies was fluctuating wildly. The repair process affected the entire system, Linmo said, including those who had already been modified. Inevitable. Carl&#x27;s said without looking up, the system is a whole.</p>
<p>Repairing the core module is like performing major surgery on a patient. The whole body will react. He repaired another crack, bringing the progress to 25%. But then a new problem arose. The control core issued an alarm.</p>
<p>An abnormal energy accumulation was detected externally. Linmo pulled up the external surveillance footage. Above the Dead Sea, the once calm bacterial membrane began to churn violently. Dark red lower structures surged up from the depths like blood gushing from a wound. Countless tiny vortices formed on the surface of the bacterial membrane, each releasing pale green gas from its center.</p>
<p>The gas rose and formed a low-hanging cloud above the sea. Further a field, Dragon Souls fleet began to move. Several warships were accelerating towards the Dead Sea. The activity of high alitude reconnaissance aircraft also suddenly increased. They noticed a change in the fortresses condition.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo said they probably thought we were doing something dangerous. Stay calm. Carl&#x27;s voice was very weak. There are a few more latent cracks left. You will complete them.</p>
<p>Remember, the last step is to reinitialize the quantum array. It must be perfectly synchronized with an error of no more than 0.3 micros dot. He handed the repair device to Hidden Shadow. At the moment of handover, Carl staggered and almost fell. Lynn Mo caught him and found that his body was frighteningly light, as if he were just a skeleton.</p>
<p>The mentor was watching him from the shadows. Continue. Carl&#x27;s leaned against the wall, his breathing slow and deep. Finish it. Get this damn facility back to normal.</p>
<p>Dot. Chinny nodded and turned to face the module. His movements were more clumsy than Carl&#x27;s, but more resolute. His hands were steady, his eyes fixed on the data stream on the screen. The repair continued.</p>
<p>Progress 37% 52% 68%. Outside, Dragon Souls warships had reached the edge of the Dead Sea. The gas cloud released by the bacterial membrane grew increasingly dense, beginning to spread outwards. Time 18 hours and 21 minutes remaining. The repair is just one final step away.</p>
<p>Chapter 150. New student mode. Repair progress. 99%. The shadowy figure&#x27;s hand hovered over the control panel, his fingertips trembling slightly.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t fear, but a physiological reaction to excessive focus. His eyes were fixed on the final data stream on the screen, awaiting that perfect synchronization moment. Carl&#x27;s breathing came from behind him, slow and weak. Lynn Emmo supported the old man, feeling his body gradually growing cold. The long-term erosion by the active factors had altered Carl&#x27;s physiological state, and now the systemic fluctuations caused by the repair process were triggering a chain reaction within his body.</p>
<p>Hang in there, Lyno whispered. Carl shook his head, his voice soft. It&#x27;s all right. The mission is almost finished. This is good.</p>
<p>Outside, Dragon Souls warships had approached within 20 nautical miles. Their deep sea probes were being deployed, attempting to determine what was happening inside the fortress. The gas cloud released by the bacterial film grew increasingly dense, forming a natural barrier on the sea surface, hindering optical reconnaissance. The emergency lighting in the control center remained a dim red glow. The data flow rate in the central column began to slow like the calm before storm.</p>
<p>Now, Shadow whispered, his finger pressed down. The repairer emitted a soft hum as the final batch of nano units was injected into the crystal structure. On the screen, the last crack began to heal, closing from both ends toward the middle as neatly as a zipper being pulled up. The quantum array is reinitialized. The moment the progress bar reached 100%, the entire fortress trembled.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a violent shaking, but some kind of deep fundamental change. The frequency of that omnipresent energy field changed from a strong singular rhythm to a gentle complex and multi-dimensional one. The light shifted from a dark red to a soft pale blue, but the brightness was reduced by a third, making it closer to the texture of natural light. The cloying sweetness in the air began to dissipate, replaced by a fresh scent, similar to the air after rain. The control interface refreshes automatically.</p>
<p>All the text, icons, and menus have been rearranged, changing from a rigid grid-like layout to a more organic and fluid one. The systems language has also changed. No longer a rigid set of instructions, but more like suggestions and reminders. The security protocol module has been repaired. System mode switch from simplified enforcement to adaptive learning.</p>
<p>Reassessment of environmental parameters revealed significant deviations from the standard blueprint. Adaptive adjustment procedures have been initiated. Temporary administrator privileges will be automatically upgraded to full administrator privileges. Level four validity unlimited inheritable/transferable. Lynmo&#x27;s bracelet vibrated, indicating that the permission upgrade was complete.</p>
<p>He can now access all functional modules, including modifying blueprint parameters. But before he could even do anything, the system had already begun to adjust itself. Monitoring footage showed that the bacterial film above the Dead Sea ceased its abnormal churning. The dark red lower layers began to slowly sink, disappearing back into the depths. The released gas cloud gradually diluted and dissipated.</p>
<p>The color of the bacterial film itself also changed from grayish white to a more natural brownish green and its thickness significantly decreased. It is self- adjusting. The shadowy figure star stare at the data stream. Look, the target parameters of the environment modification system have changed. It has no longer forcibly matching the standard blueprint, but has set an acceptable range.</p>
<p>The system will try to adjust the environment to this range, but no longer requires a perfect match. The status of the biomodification workshop has also been updated. All projects have been automatically paused and the system has begun to reassess the necessity and priority of each project. Those organisms dormant in their containers have been labeled as samples to be evaluated. The most noticeable changes occurred in the living area.</p>
<p>The physiological data of the wings of freedom personnel began to stabilize. The concentration of active factors stopped increasing and instead showed a slow downward trend. Those who had been struggling painfully due to systemic fluctuations gradually calmed down, but most fell into a deep sleep. Their transformation process has stopped, Carl said softly, a hint of relief in his voice. The system no longer actively transforms them, but the changes that have already occurred are irreversible.</p>
<p>They need medical assistance long-term. Lynn Emmo quickly assessed the situation. The repairs were successful. The fortress has entered a relatively mild adaptive mode. No longer forcibly altering the environment.</p>
<p>However, the damage already caused needs to be addressed. The people inside need to be rescued and external forces need to be dealt with. He contacted outside first. This time, communication went much more smoothly. With level four access granted, all communication channels were open and Lynn Mo selected the highest priority encrypted frequency band.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian, can you hear me? After a brief delay, Sue Chian&#x27;s voice came through, tinged with obvious anxiety. Linmo, how are you? We detected a drastic change in the fortress&#x27;s energy field. The Dragon Soul Fleet is approaching and those fungal membranes. We succeeded. Lynn Emmo interrupted her.</p>
<p>The security protocol has been repaired and the fortress has switched to adaptive mode. Environmental modifications have been halted, but further processing is needed. Listen, the most important things now are first, notify Dragon Soul to suspend all military operations and show them our authorization certificates to prove that the fortress is under control. Second, prepare medical teams and isolation facilities. We need to rescue the people inside.</p>
<p>Third, the Coral Society must stop all biofilm research. Those things are currently in an unstable state. Duh. I understand. Su Chanchians voice stabilized, but Dragon Soul might not believe it easily.</p>
<p>Give them the data. Lynn Mo said, I will grant them access to some of the external sensors of the fortress so they can see the real situation. Also, tell them that attacking the fortress could trigger the defense system or cause an uncontrollable ecological disaster. This is not a threat. It is a fact.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll handle it right away. When will you be out? Lynn Mo glanced at Chenning and Cars soon. But we need to deal with things inside first. Keep communications open. After ending the call, he turned to the control core interface.</p>
<p>Now that he has full access, there&#x27;s so much he can do, but he needs to be careful. While adaptive mode is gentle, the system is still powerful, and a single incorrect command could cause new problems. He first reviewed the overall status report of the fortress. Energy supply has stabilized at 65% load, a 17% decrease from before the repairs. Most of the energy savings come from the downgraded operation of the environmental modification system.</p>
<p>It now only maintains basic environmental monitoring and fine-tuning functions. No longer performing large-scale deep breathing, all biology related modules have been placed on evaluation pause. The system recommends conducting adaptive release tests on existing modified organisms to observe their survival ability under the new model before deciding whether to continue or terminate the project. The database was completely open. Lenmo browsed through it and found the amount of knowledge stored within to be astonishing.</p>
<p>Not just ecology and engineering, but also the history, culture, and scientific achievements of that lost civilization. It was a complete backup of a civilization. We need to develop a long-term management plan. Chining said this fortress can&#x27;t te just be left standing, but it also can&#x27;t he be misused. Save lives first.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo decided control system. Prepare medical rescue procedures. Mark all personnel in the living area as requiring medical assistance. Open a transport channel from the living area to our entrance and prepare to transport them out. The system responded quickly.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, a new route lit up on the structural diagram, connecting the living quarters to the cylindrical cabin they had entered from. The transport cabin was ready and automated, suspended stretcher capable of smoothly transporting people with mobility impairments. I&#x27;ll go help. Chining said, &quot;Mentor, you stay here and rest.&quot; Carl shook his head. I logo too.</p>
<p>I know their situation and how to handle it. And he paused. There are some things I need to say in person. Dot. The three returned to the living area.</p>
<p>The passageway had been cleared and the lights were adjusted to a level suitable for human vision. When they arrived, automated stretchers were carrying out the sleeping people one by one. Most of the Wings of Liberty members were in a semi-com state, but their consciousness was gradually returning. Some open their eyes, their gazes unfocused, as if they had just woken from a long nightmare. Carl walked up to a man who seemed to be in slightly better condition.</p>
<p>He was a minor leader of the Wings of Liberty and Lynn Mo remembered his name as Wreck, having appeared in early black market transaction records. Rex cars crouched down. Can you hear me? Rick&#x27;s eyes slowly focused. Half of his face was covered with a grayish white net-like pattern, but his gaze was still relatively clear. Carl&#x27;s he recognized the other man.</p>
<p>UV been inside all this time. 3 years. Carse nodded. Listen, things have changed. The fortress will no longer forcibly modify the environment, nor will it modify you.</p>
<p>But your bodies have changed and you need professional medical care. We will send you out, but once you are out, you must cooperate with the treatment and take responsibility for what you have done. Dot. Rick was silent for a few seconds, then gave a rice smile. Take responsibility.</p>
<p>We just want to survive in the apocalypse. But you almost destroyed the entire sea area. Chinny and couldn&#x27;t te help but say you activated something you shouldn&#x27;t te have touched and ignored warnings. Dot. We thought we could control it.</p>
<p>Rick s voice trailed off. We were wrong. Dot. The transport lasted about an hour. A total of 37 people were carried to the exit compartment.</p>
<p>Their conditions varied. Some could still walk with difficulty while others required complete reliance on stretchers. All of them showed varying degrees of physical alteration ranging from skin discoloration to abnormal organ function. Linmo had the system prepared detailed medical reports including each person&#x27;s physiological data, active factor concentrations, and recommended treatment plants. This information would be sent along with them to external medical teams.</p>
<p>After seeing off the last person, the three return to the control center. The situation outside is also changing. Upon receiving the data, the Dragon Soul fleet halted its advance and established a perimeter 30 nautical miles away. They dispatched negotiators, requesting direct dialogue with the fortress&#x27;s controllers. Back at the Coral Society, Sue Chanchian had already conveyed the warning.</p>
<p>Disagreements had arisen within the society. Some radicals were unwilling to abandon the research, but the mainstream opinion had shifted towards caution. The abnormal changes in the bacterial membranes had also made them realize that this thing was far more complex than it appeared. The problem now is what to do with the fortress itself. Lynmo looked at the data stream on the central pillar.</p>
<p>We can te stay here forever, but it can&#x27;t be left unattended either. Dot automated management programs can be set up. Carl suggested in adaptive mode. The system can operate autonomously requiring only periodic checks and adjustments. We can set some basic principles.</p>
<p>Do not actively modify the environment. Do not create new organisms. And do not interfere with natural ecological evolution. Only when a major ecological disaster is detected will a limited repair program be initiated. Dot.</p>
<p>We also need a monitoring mechanism. Chining added. Someone will come in regularly to check and ensure that the system doesn&#x27;t deviate from its settings. The Brotherhood or Moan Pavilion can take on this responsibility. Then Emmo pondered, &quot;This plan was feasible, but it required establishing a complete protocol.</p>
<p>The fortress&#x27;s technology was too powerful. Its use must be strictly limited.&quot; He started operating the system and began setting management rules. First, the maximum output power of the environmental modification module is limited to less than 10% of the original power and it can only be used to repair existing damage, not for new large- scale modifications. Secondly, all biological related modules are locked, allowing only research and analysis and prohibiting physical modification experiments. Existing modified organisms will be evaluated to determine their fate.</p>
<p>Those suitable for release will be released while those unsuitable will remain under closed management within the facility. Third, the defense system is adjusted to a purely passive mode, only making minimal defensive responses to direct attacks and not actively threatening any targets. Fourth, the database has open red permissions, but the application of core technologies requires multiple authorizations. After the settings were completed, the system underwent a simulated operation test. The results showed that in this mode, the fortress&#x27;s impact on the surrounding environment was minimized.</p>
<p>Energy consumption was reduced by 70% and it essentially entered a dormant observation state. That&#x27;s enough, Lin Mo said. Now we need to leave. They walked back to the original cylindrical compartment. The submersible was still there quietly, its hatch closed.</p>
<p>The system indicated that the external water pressure was normal and they could leave at any time. But Carl stopped in front of hatch. I&#x27;m not leaving, he said. Chenning suddenly turned around. mentor.</p>
<p>My body has adapted to the environment here, Carl said calmly. Back outside, I would need to stay in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, undergo painful treatments every day, and I donty even know how long I would live. But staying here allows me to continue my research, monitor the systems operation, and make sure it doesn&#x27;t te go out of control again. Dot. He looked at Lyno.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need someone here. No matter how perfect the automation program is, it can&#x27;t compare to a judged administrator. I am the most suitable candidate. Lynn Mo remained silent. Carl&#x27;s reasons were valid, but it meant he would have to spend the rest of his life in this deep sea fortress.</p>
<p>We can send people here regularly. Chinyanging said, &quot;You danti need to stay here alone all the time.&quot; Dot. Loneliness. Car smiled. This place contains the knowledge base of an entire civilization, advanced scientific research facilities, and many unsolved mysteries.</p>
<p>To me, this is not a prison, but paradise. He patted Shadow on the shoulder. You should go. There&#x27;s a lot out there for you to do. The Brotherhood needs rebuilding, and the mistakes of those radicals need to be corrected.</p>
<p>Also, look at the sky for me. Look at the real ocean. I haven&#x27;t seen it in a long time. Chininks eyes reened, but he didn&#x27;t insist. He understood his mentor.</p>
<p>The final farewell was brief. Carse entered new administrator privilege settings, setting himself as the permanent administrator and Lin Mo and Shining as backup administrators who could access the system remotely if necessary. The hatch closed and the submersible started. As the cylindrical chamber was refilled with seawater, the top passage opened and they began to rise. Through the observation window, Lynn Emmo took one last look at the ancient fortress.</p>
<p>Bathed in pale blue internal lighting, it appeared quiet and mysterious, like a sleeping behemoth. But now this behemoth was in shackles. The ascent was very smooth. 100 m, 50 m, 20 m. Then they surfaced.</p>
<p>The sunlight was blinding. A fresh salty sea breeze blew against the observation window. In the distance, the Miuan Pavilion support ship was approaching, its flags fluttering in the wind. The submersible hatch opened and Lin Mo and Chiening climbed onto the deck. Su Chian was the first to rush over looking Lin Mo up and down and only breathed a sigh of relief after confirming that he was all right.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, how?&quot; Leewi Chin Duo Duo and other core members of Moan Pavilion were also there. &quot;Welcome back,&quot; Such Chen said. Lynmo nodded and looked southwest. There the Dead Sea still had an unnatural color and the bacterial film had not completely disappeared. But change had begun.</p>
<p>A new ecosystem would gradually recover though would take time. Is it over? Sure. How asked it started? Lynn Emmo corrected. The fortress was under control, but the problem wasn&#x27;t completely solved. There were still negotiations with the dragon soul, research by the Coral Society, the rebuilding of the Brotherhood, treatment of the rescue personnel, and the ravaged sea area.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s still a lot to do, but at least now they have the initiative. In the distance, seabirds flew across the sky, emitting clear calls. A new day has begun. Chapter 1, 151. Aftermath and prologue.</p>
<p>The third day after returning to Mayuin Pavilion. Life at the base seemed to have returned to its usual rhythm. At the dock, fishing boats set out at dawn and returned in the evening, their holds full of fish. Workers in the aquaculture area fed the fish and cleaned the net cages as usual. Patrol boats cruised along their predetermined routes.</p>
<p>Everything proceeding in an orderly manner. But the calm was only superficial. In the command center, seven windows were opened simultaneously on the screen in front of Lyno. The negotiation minutes of Dragon Soul, the research trends of the Coral Society, the latest intelligence within the Brotherhood, the medical reports of the wounded of Wings of Liberty, the ecological monitoring data of the Dead Sea area, the daily status report of the fortress, and an encrypted document that had just been delivered. She duo Duo sat opposite, holding a cup of tea that had gone cold with dark circles under her eyes.</p>
<p>The situation with Dragon Soul is temporarily stable. He pointed to the negotiation minutes. They accepted some of the data we provided and agreed to designate the Dead Sea area as a jointly monitored zone to be jointly monitored by Mo Yuan Pavilion in Dragon Soul. However, they demanded regular access to the fortress&#x27;s decontamination technology, claiming it was for environmental remediation research. What is the real purpose? I don&#x27;t know, but it is definitely not just about environmental restoration.</p>
<p>Aian duo duo shook his head. Their technical advisory team has recently been purchasing a lot of deep sea drilling and high energy physics experimental equipment. I suspect they want to reverse engineer the fortresses energy system or materials technology dot. Linmo nodded and made note of it. What about the coral society? They outwardly comply but secretly operate expression turned serious.</p>
<p>They withdrew most of their research ships, but left three automatic observation stations on the edge of the Dead Sea. Our drones discovered that these observation stations release small samplers every night to collect samples deep into the bacterial film area. Moreover, they have secret contacts with several international biotechnology companies, seemingly negotiating commercial cooperation. What are the details of the collaboration? I&#x27;m not sure, but involves gene editing and synthetic biology. Chin Duo Duo said.</p>
<p>Such Chanchian has a more detailed analysis. Linmo switched to the communication channel in the medical area. Such Chanchian is working in the temporary isolation medical area. 37 former Wings of Freedom members have been placed here, each living in an individual isolation pod, receiving 24-hour monitoring and treatment. In a video, Sue Chian wearing full protective gear is checking on a patient through an observation window.</p>
<p>The patient is covered in monitoring patches and vital signs data are displayed on a nearby screen. Now, is the situation? Lynn Mo asked. Stable but not improving. D suit Changen&#x27;s voice came through the communicator sounding tired. The active factors have deeply bound to their cells and conventional methods cannot remove them.</p>
<p>Wei tried several antidotes, but the effects are limited. Right now, we can only maintain their vital signs and prevent further deterioration. She pulled up a set of data charts. What&#x27;s more troublesome is that their metabolic patterns have changed. The oxygen content in normal air is too high for them, and long-term exposure will lead to oxidative stress damage.</p>
<p>We had to reduce the oxygen content in the isolation chamber to 16% close to the level at high altitude. Is there any hope of recovery? Not in the short term, Sue Chanchian said frankly. But Carl sent some research data from the fortress about the mechanism of action of the active factor and possible reversal methods. It will take time to analyze and perhaps we can find a breakthrough. Dot.</p>
<p>She paused for a moment. In addition, several people have begun to recover parts of their memories. They said that while in the fortress, they heard the system speaking. Not a voice, but more like thoughts appearing directly in their minds. One of them can also draw some strange symbols which Lewi is analyzing.</p>
<p>Telepathic communication. Linmo recalled the high level of intelligence the system had demonstrated during the test. If the fortress could truly interact with human consciousness, its technological level far exceeded his imagination. After ending the communication, Sherhow walked in holding an updated report on the defense deployment. The monitoring network around the base has been strengthened that he handed the report to Linmo.</p>
<p>We have added 12 deep sea sonar arrays, extending the coverage radius to 40 nautical miles. In addition, we have set up physical interception nets and chemical barrier agent delivery points to target the possible spread routes of the bacterial film dot. What moves has the Dragon&#x27;s soul fleet made? They staying 30 nautical miles away, but they&#x27;ve deployed more reconnaissance aircraft and underwater drones, Shouse said. Moreover, their submarines have been frequently active near the edge of the Dead Sea recently as if mapping the seabed. I am worried they re looking for other routes into the fortress.</p>
<p>Lanimo pondered for a moment. Keep monitoring, but don&#x27;t provoke them. As long as they don&#x27;t cross the 20 nautical mile line, there&#x27;s no need to overreact. Understood that. Sure.</p>
<p>how paused. There is one more thing. In the past few days, our patrol boats have discovered some unusual marine life 60 nautical miles east of the base. They read not modified organisms, but their behavior is strange. They swim in groups in straight lines as if they have a clear goal.</p>
<p>Sampling analysis shows that they have trace amounts of active factors remaining in their bodies. Dot. Where did it come from? It&#x27;s uncertain, but the direction points to the Dead Sea region. Sher House said it could be spores or particles released from the bacterial film that have spread with the ocean currents. Although the concentration is very low, the long-term effects are unknown.</p>
<p>This is yet another issue that requires long-term attention. Leewi pushed open the door and came in, his face showing a mixture of excitement and confusion. Mr. Lynn, the analysis of those symbols has yielded results that he held a tablet in his hand. The symbols in the memories of former Wings of Liberty members partially match a certain coding system in the fortress database, but they are not technical instructions.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re more like log records. What content it s fragmented, but pieced together it roughly means the blueprint has fundamental errors. The environmental parameters are set in conflict with the local evolutionary history and recalibration is recommended. Leeway said, &quot;This confirms our judgment. The standard blueprint for the fortress is indeed not suitable for Earth.</p>
<p>But what interesting is that the timestamps on these logs are very old, even earlier than the construction time of the fortress. Line looked up. What do you mean? It means that the designers knew there were problems with the blueprint from the beginning, but still decided to use a simplified solution. Leeway explained, &quot;It might have been due to time constraints or limited resources, but they included a correction mechanism in the system, which is the security protocol module. They just didn&#x27;t expect that the module would be corrupted when it was activated.</p>
<p>Therefore, the violent activation of Wings of Liberty destroyed a safety valve that could have prevented disaster.&quot; That is right. Leeway nodded. Moreover, based on these log fragments, the designers seem to have anticipated this situation. They left behind a backup plan, but it requires specific conditions to be met to trigger it. Dot.</p>
<p>What are the conditions? It is still unclear. The log is incomplete. Leewi said regretfully. We need more information. Carl&#x27;s is searching in the Fortress database, but he said the data there is vast and might take months or even years to sort through.</p>
<p>Dot months, years. Time waits for no one. Lenmo looked at the last window. The fortress&#x27;s daily status report. The system operated smoothly with energy consumption kept at a low level.</p>
<p>Carl&#x27;s vital signs were stable. He worked 10 hours a day organizing the database, monitoring system operation, and occasionally sending in some interesting discoveries. The most recent message was sent 2 hours ago. An encrypted design document has been discovered, marked final emergency protocol. Decryption requires triple authorization.</p>
<p>the resident administrator, me, the backup administrator, you, and an unknown third party. Attempts are underway to crack the first two layers. Final emergency protocol. That doesn&#x27;t sound simple. Linmo replied with authorization confirmation.</p>
<p>He and Shianing as backup administrators could jointly decrypt the data, but the identity of the third party remained a mystery. Was it a contingency plan left by the designers or a long extinct oversight body? By the time all the reports were processed, it was already evening. Lynn Emmo walked to the observation deck outside the command center. The setting sun was slowly sinking below the horizon, painting the sky in a gradient of orange and crimson. The cool sea breeze dispelled the daytime heat.</p>
<p>Such an also came out carrying two cups of hot tea. &quot;Are you tired?&quot; she asked, hitting her glass. &quot;It&#x27;s all right.&quot; Lyn and Mo took the teacup, the steam rising on his face. It just feels like we&#x27;ve solved one problem and 10 new ones have popped up. This is the norm.</p>
<p>Do Sue Chian leaned against the railing next to him. It was the same when I was doing research in the lab. Every time I answer a question, more questions would arise. Science is like this and so is survival. Dot.</p>
<p>She looked at the distant sea. The Dead Sea is starting to lighten in color. The latest satellite images show that the area covered by the bofilm has decreased by 5% in the past 3 days. Although it&#x27;s slow, it is indeed improving. Will the ecosystem recover? It will take time, but it will.</p>
<p>Sue Chanchan said, &quot;Nature has a powerful ability to repair itself. As long as we stop causing damage once the fortress enters adaptive mode, it will no longer output active factors, and those bacterial films will lose their instruction source and begin to decay naturally. The seawater surification function is also at work. The acidity is slowly decreasing and the dissolved oxygen content is beginning to rise. She paused for a moment.</p>
<p>However, some changes may be permanent. The genes of those modified organisms have been altered and will be passed on in the future. This sea area may evolve some new species. Is it a blessing or a curse? I don&#x27;t know. Sue Champion Sugarhead.</p>
<p>Evolution has no good or evil, only survival the fittest. They may fill certain ecological niches or they may become invasive species and disrupt the balance. We need to monitor them in the long term and intervene when necessary. Dot. The two remain silent for a while watching the sun completely sink into the sea and the sky turned deep blue.</p>
<p>What are you planning to do next? Su Chanchian asked. Lyn Mo took a sip of tea and looked southwest. That was where the fortress was located and the starting point of everything they had just experienced. We need a real base, he said. Not some temporary outpost, but a home where we can establish a long-term foothold, withstand all kinds of threats, and support our development.</p>
<p>We can learn from the technology of fortresses, but we cannot rely on it. We need to have our own strength. Doc, he remembered that in used item in the daily login system, the epic shelter, sky city core template. He&#x27;d had it for a long time, but the astonishing material requirements had kept it shelved. Now, perhaps the time was right.</p>
<p>You already have a plan? Su Chian looked at him. Yes, Lyno nodded. But it takes time, resources, and manpower, and we need to deal with the current troubles. Dot. The communicator rang.</p>
<p>It was Chandua&#x27;s emergency channel. Mister Lynn, we just received new intelligence. Chiandui&#x27;s voice was more urgent than usual. The Dragon Soles top brass suddenly held an emergency meeting. The topic is unclear, but the attendees included their strategic nuclear force commander.</p>
<p>At the same time, a research vessel from the Coral Society entered the Dead Sea area without authorization 3 hours ago and is currently out of contact. Also, the radical remnants of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood have gathered at least five ships in the Southeast Sea area with unknown equipment that all three pieces of news were bad. Lyno put down his teacup. The aftermath has barely subsided when a new chapter has begun. As night falls, twinkling lights illuminate the sea.</p>
<p>These are the ships of the Muan pavilion and also the small yet tenacious flames of civilization in this sea area. But in the depths of darkness, even more undercurrents are surging. Let&#x27;s go, Lynamo said to sue Chian. We have something else to do. The two turned and walked back to the command center.</p>
<p>Under the lights, new challenges await. Chapter 152. Undercurrents rise again. The meeting was held in the briefing room next to the command center. Core members of the Muan Pavilion sat around a long table, each with a freshly printed intelligence summary spread out before them.</p>
<p>The air was thick with a mingled smells of strong coffee and anxiety. Lynn and Mo sat in the main seat, his fingers tapping lightly on the table. This was a habitual gesture he made when he was thinking. We ll address these three issues one by one. He began his voice steady.</p>
<p>Let us start with the Coral Society s research vessel. Su Chanchchan, what are your thoughts? Su Chanchian pulled up a map of the sea area and marked a red dot at the edge of the Dead Sea. Explorer 7, one of the most advanced research vessels of the Coral Society, is equipped with a full set of deep sea exploration and sampling equipment. She pointed to the data. Its last communication was before entering the dense bofilm area at the edge of the Dead Sea, reporting that it had discovered abnormal proliferation of the bofilm structure and intended to approach to take samples.</p>
<p>It lost contact abnormal growth? Leeway asked. According to the last data they sent back, the bacterial biofilm suddenly thickened three times in a localized area and exhibited muscle-like contractal movements. Sue Chanchan zoomed in on several blurry images. This is very abnormal. The bacterial biofilm itself is an aggregate of microorganisms and shoot and tea have this kind of macroscopic movement capability.</p>
<p>Unless unless the fortress&#x27;s system is still affecting it. Sure, how guest or the bacterial bofilm itself may have evolved some kind of collective intelligence. Sue Chanchan said, &quot;But what I&#x27;m more worried about is that this proliferation may be a defensive response to invasion like the immune system attacking foreign objects.&quot; Lyno nodded. So the research vessel may have triggered some kind of defense mechanism and is now trapped or destroyed. We need to send someone to check it out.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go. Sure. How said immediately. Take two patrol boats and make sure they&#x27;re well protected. If a ship is still standing, there might be survivors.</p>
<p>Be careful of the bacterial film. Such reminded. Bring strong disinfectant and a flamethrower. Those things are susceptible to high temperatures and strong oxidizers. Clear.</p>
<p>Lin Mo turned to the second question. Dragon Souls emergency meeting. Manager Chien, can you dig out more details? Chendo duo rubbed her temples, clearly having not slept all night. The inside source only knows that the meeting was of a very high level with participants including people from the Strategic Nuclear Forces Command and several senior research advisers. He said the agenda was not leaked.</p>
<p>But after the meeting, Dragon Souls nuclear submarine Deep Diver 3 changed its cruise route and is now moving southeast. At the same time, their satellite reconnaissance frequency has tripled with key monitoring areas, including our bases and fortresses. Southeast, Lynn, Emo drew a line on the map. What&#x27;s there? A deep sea plane with no special resources, but it&#x27;s only a 100 nautical miles from where the radical faction of the Stonemason&#x27;s Brotherhood is gathered. Leeway interjected.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul might be worried that the Brotherhood&#x27;s radicals might do something crazy like trying to reactivate the fortress or steal the technology. They might be considering a preemptive strike. Or they might want to take advantage of the situation to seize control of the fortress. Chiian Duo added, &quot;After all, the fortress is relatively stable now, and we are managing it. For them, this is both a threat and a temptation to Lynn Mo ponder for a moment.</p>
<p>continue to monitor them, but Dante provoked them. He said, &quot;If necessary, we can proactively contact them, provide some nonsensitive data, and demonstrate our transparency. At the same time, we should have our patrols avoid the dragon soulless activity areas to prevent misjudgment.&quot; Clear? The third question. Lyn Mo looked at Chining. What intelligence do you have about the radical faction within the Brotherhood? Since returning to Mayu pavilion, Chining has been trying to contact old acquaintances within the Brotherhood.</p>
<p>However, the conservatives, having seized power, have conducted a thorough purge, cutting off many channels of communication. All I know is that they assembled five ships, all of which have been modified and equipped with deep sea operation equipment, Chinyang said. The leader is a former colleague of mine named Anvil Deas, a tech fanatic who firmly believes that we should fully master the fortresses s technology no matter the cost. Three years ago, he advocated for a forced entry into the fortress for research. And now that wings of freedom has proven that entry is possible.</p>
<p>He has even less likely to give up dot. When might they start there more than one maintenance access route to the fortress? The shadow pulled up a structural diagram. The one we&#x27;re using is the emergency access route directly above, but according to the design, there are at least three other side entrances located at different points on the seabed. The Brotherhood S exploration over the past few decades may have already located the approximate locations of one or two of them. Lin Mo looked at the possible entrance locations on the map, all of which were within the Dead Sea area.</p>
<p>What would be the consequences if they entered now? It has hard to say. Chining shook his head. The fortress is currently in adaptive mode. It may react mildly to unauthorized entrance, but at one t let them get away with it. Moreover, if the radicals force their way in, they might damage the security protocol again, causing the system to revert to mandatory enforcement mode.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t let them in. Suian said, &quot;We finally managed to stabilize the situation. But we don&#x27;t have enough power to blockade the entire Dead Sea area.&quot; Sure, how said Frankly. Our fleet is limited in size and we also have to take care of base defense and daily patrols. There was a moment of silence in the conference room.</p>
<p>Lynmo suddenly spoke up. Perhaps a lockdown is not necessary. Everyone looked at him. We can take the initiative to invite them to negotiate. Lynmo said through the shadow s connections we can contact the anvil and tell them that we are willing to share some technical data but only if they give up their forced entry.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can let them know about dragon soulless movements. Let them know that acting recklessly now could trigger a full-scale conflict. Will they believe it? Chi and Duo Duo asked. Anvil is a fanatic but not stupid. Shadow said he knows the Brotherhood is no match for Dragon Soul right now.</p>
<p>If he can get some technical data, he can at least go back and rebuild his position. It could be a win-win situation. Dot. Let us give a try. Do Lin Mo made the decision.</p>
<p>Chenning Yuri in charge of making the contact manager Chien ULL provides some peripheral data as a sample of sincerity. Remember only provide basic environmental monitoring data, not the core technology. Good. The three urgent problems had a temporary solution, but Linmo knew that these were only stop gap measures. True long-term stability required greater strength and a more secure base.</p>
<p>He pulled up another document and projected it onto the screen. That was a brief introduction and materials list for the epic shelter sky city core template. The list was astonishingly long, ranging from tens of thousands of tons of special steel to various rare elements and then to complex electronic components and energy cores. This is our long-term goal, Linmo said. A mobile, self-sufficient aerial fortress that can withstand any threat.</p>
<p>Only with it can we truly take control of our own destiny. Leewi&#x27;s eyes lit up as he looked at the list of materials, but then he frowned. Many of these materials I have never seen before. Some exist only in theory, while others may need to be extracted from the deep sea or special minerals. So, we&#x27;ll start preparations now.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo said, &quot;Sue Chanchian, you&#x27;ll be in charge of the biological and ecological aspects, researching the ecological cycle system mentioned in the template. Leewei, you&#x27;ll be in charge of technology and engineering, analyzing the construction process and key technical challenges. Manager Chien, you&#x27;ll be in charge of resource channels, seeing which materials can be obtained through trade and which we need to mine ourselves. He paused for a moment. Sure, how you&#x27;re in charge of security and defense.</p>
<p>Building such a fortress can&#x27;t be kept completely secret. Once the news leaks, it could attract the covetous eyes of various parties. We need to prepare contingency plans in advance. The tasks were assigned and everyone felt the pressure but also a touch of excitement. If the sky city were built, it would completely change their way of life.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Lynn Mo remained alone in the briefing room. He pulled up the fortress&#x27;s live surveillance footage. The Dead Sea area remained calm and the bacterial film was slowly receding. Inside the fortress, Carse was working on the database. His vital signs were stable.</p>
<p>However, the decryption of the final emergency protocol is progressing slowly. Two layers of the triple authorization have been passed, but the third layer remains elusive. The system prompts that civilization inheritor certification is required. A completely unfamiliar concept. Lyno rubbed his temples.</p>
<p>One mystery after another. The answers always seemed so close yet so far away. The communicator rang. It was a report from the forward patrol. Mr.</p>
<p>Lynn Weeve found some floating debris on the edge of the Dead Sea. Sure. How s voice came through. It s confirmed to be the wreckage of the Explorer 7 that the hull is severely damaged as if it was torn apart from the inside by something. We found no survivors, but we salvaged some equipment fragments and a recorder.</p>
<p>Can a recorder still be read? We&#x27;re trying, but the casing is severely damaged and we may need technical support from Leeway&#x27;s team. Bring the wreckage and all salvaged items back. Take precautions against biohazards as the wreckage may be covered with bacterial films or bioactive agents. Clear. After ending the call, Linmo walked to the window.</p>
<p>Night had fallen and only a few navigation lights flickered on the sea. In the distance, the dead sea was shrouded in darkness. Even the starlight seemed to have been swallowed up. What did Explorer 7 encounter? Just how dangerous is the Bofilm&#x27;s defense mechanism? What is Dragon Souls true intention? How will the Brotherhood&#x27;s radical faction choose? Problems came flooding in like a tide. But Lin Mo knew that anxiety wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem.</p>
<p>They needed to take it one step at a time, dealing with the most urgent issues, preparing for the most important ones, and remaining vigilant at the same time. He returned to the control panel and began to formulate a detailed resource gathering plan. Sky City needed a massive amount of materials and the existing reserves of Mo Yuon Pavilion were just a drop in the ocean. He would need to mobilize his connections and trading networks throughout the region and might even need to venture into uncharted waters to explore from mineral deposits. Although the daily check-in system provides a considerable amount of resources, it&#x27;s still far from sufficient for such a massive project.</p>
<p>He must find a more efficient way to acquire them. At 11 p.m. Leewayi excitedly knocked on the door. Mr. Lynn, some of the data from the recorder has been recovered.</p>
<p>He held up a tablet computer. Although at s incomplete, there is a crucial recording dot. Lyno took the tablet and pressed play. First came a series of noisy electrical crackling sounds. Then a man&#x27;s urgent voice.</p>
<p>The bacterial film is moving. It&#x27;s enveloping the hull and secretreting some kind of acidic mucus. The hull is dissolving. The propulsion system has failed. In the background, screams from others and the sound of metal twisting could be heard.</p>
<p>Then came another voice sounding like the captain. Activate the emergency buoys. Send out all data. Tell the society that the bofilms are not passive structures. They are alive.</p>
<p>They are conscious. A violent tremor and a cracking sound followed. The final recording is a near whisper filled with fear and confusion. They&#x27;re learning. They&#x27;re learning from us.</p>
<p>Oh my god, they&#x27;re imitating us. The recording ends here. Leeway looked at Lyn Mo, his face pale. The bacterial film is censient. How is that possible? Lynn Emmo stared at the sound wave diagram on the screen.</p>
<p>The trembling in that last sentence was genuine fear. Perhaps not consciousness, but some kind of distributed intelligence, he said slowly. Like an ant colony or a bee colony. The individual organisms are simple, but the collective can exhibit complex behaviors. Biofilms are composed of countless microorganisms if they can coordinate their actions through chemical signals.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t finish speaking, but Leeway already understood. Then explorer 7 became their learning model, Leeway murmured. They learned about material strength from the hull structure, energy conduction from the electronic equipment, and even from the crew. He dared not continue. Lynn and Mo close the recording file.</p>
<p>Notify all units to temporarily refrain from approaching the bacterial film area. We will decide on the next step after Sue Chanchian finishes analyzing the retrieve samples. Also send this recording to Carl&#x27;s and ask him if there are similar records in the database. Good. After Leewi left, LinMo stood alone in front of the control panel.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the night grew even darker. Undercurrents are stirring and they have only caught a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg. The real challenge may have only just begun. Chapter 153. The intelligence of microbial films.</p>
<p>Morning light streamed through the observation window into the biological laboratory, casting bright spots on the metal workbench. Su Chian stood before the protective isolation cabinet. Her hands clad in three layers of gloves, carefully manipulating the robotic arm. Inside the cabinet were bacterial samples scraped from the wreckage of Explorer 7. The sample was placed in a transparent petri dish.</p>
<p>Its grayish white surface interspersed with dark red veins. Under the microscope, these veins revealed a complex network structure, denser and more organized than the bacterial films collected previously. Lenmo stood outside the isolation cabinet and asked through the communicator, &quot;Any discoveries? The structure has clearly evolved.&quot; Suchian&#x27;s voice came through the speaker, tense with focused attention. Look here, there are differentiation nodes resembling ganglia appearing in the veins. Microtubules connect the nodes forming a multi-level network.</p>
<p>And she adjusted the focus of the microscope to magnify a local area. These nodes are actively transmitting signals. I injected fluorescently labeled ion probes and saw them move directionally within the network 10 times faster than normal diffusion. The network itself exhibits regular electrical pulse activity at a frequency of about once per second which is very stable. Lynn Mo watched the real-time images displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>The fluorescent markers like points of light in a stream float along fixed paths pausing briefly in nodes before continuing onward. The entire network resembled some kind of primitive but efficient information processing system. Are they really learning? It at least demonstrates complex information processing capabilities. Such Chian switched the image to show the bacterial film&#x27;s response to different stimuli. I conducted several sets of experiments.</p>
<p>In the first set, a weak current was used to stimulate a local area and the entire network redistributed its charge within 3 seconds, reducing the voltage of the stimulation point to below the safe threshold. She pulled up the second set of data. In the second set, a small amount of acidic substance was placed on one side of the petri dish. The network mobilized alkaline metabolites to the corresponding area within 20 seconds, neutralizing the acid. More importantly, it remembered this event subsequently when the same substance was placed in the same location.</p>
<p>The reaction time was shortened to 5 seconds. The third group is the most troublesome. Sue Changen&#x27;s voice lowered. I put a small piece of metal in a petri dish to simulate a ship hull fragment. After the bacterial film came into contact with it, it began to secrete special enzymes that specifically decompose the components of this alloy.</p>
<p>At the same time, the network grew new veins that wrapped around the metal piece as if it was analyzing its structure. Linimo fell silent. If the bacterial membrane could analyze material structure and secrete decomposing enzymes specifically, then the rapid dissolution of explorer 7 would be explained. Even more terrifying was that this ability was evolving. Where do they get this capability? The fortress has stopped supplying it.</p>
<p>There are probably two reasons. Sue Chanchian analyzed. First, the active factors obtained early on have changed the basic biological characteristics of the microbial biofilm, giving them the potential to learn and evolve. Second, the microbial biofilm itself is evolving a community of trillions of microorganisms under extreme environmental pressure could very well evolve complex collective behaviors. She turned off the microscope, stepped out of the isolation cabinet, and began to remove her protective gear.</p>
<p>Just like early life on Earth, from single-sellled to multisellular, from simple to complex, biofilms may now be at a critical point, evolving from passive biofilms to organized super individuals. Lynmo pondered this possibility. If the bacterial film truly evolved intelligence, even a most primitive kind, it would mean that the entire Dead Sea region would no longer be a simple ecologically polluted area, but a nent unknown life system. Does it pose a threat to us? Uncertain D. Sue Chian washed her hands, her voice tinged with weariness.</p>
<p>From what we can see now, its behavior is limited to defense and adaptation. But once intelligence develops, it will seek expansion and continuation. What if it perceives us as a threat or if our resources are useful to it? She didn&#x27;t finish her sentence, but her meaning was clear. At that moment, Leeway pushed open the door and came in holding a tablet computer. Carl&#x27;s replied, he said, &quot;There are similar records in the fortress database regarding the intelligent phenomenon of bofilms.</p>
<p>During the testing phase of a standard blueprint, the designers cultivated basic ecological units, which are biofilm-like microbial clusters used as tools for environmental modification. However, these units were programmed to only execute simple instructions and lack the ability to evolve autonomously. Why do the things we encounter evolve? Carl believes that it is possible that there was a horizontal gene transfer between Earths native microorganisms and the units cultivated by the designers resulting in unplanned hybrids or leeway paused the energy shock when the fortress was activated unexpectedly increased the mutation rate of these units. In short, the current situation is beyond the design expectations dot. This was yet another unexpected consequence.</p>
<p>Linmo took the tablet and reviewed the complete data sent by Carl&#x27;s. The data showed that the designers had imposed multiple safety restrictions on this microbial cluster, including life cycle limits, diffusion range limits, and most importantly, the development of complex swarm intelligence was not allowed. But these restrictions are now clearly ineffective. Carl&#x27;s advised us to take control measures as soon as possible, Leeway said. He offered several possible containment options, ranging from biological inhibitors to targeted genetic weapons.</p>
<p>But these options all require production from within the fortress and would cause collateral damage to the existing ecosystem. How much collateral damage is there? If biological inhibitors are used, it could kill more than 90% of the microorganisms in the Dead Sea area, including many unmodified native species. Such Chanchian looked at the data. Targeted genetic weapons are more precise, but they require deciphering the genome of the bacterial biofilm first, which could take weeks or even months. Moreover, if the bofilm is already spread to a wider area, the genetic weapon may also become ineffective.</p>
<p>Time and time again, Lano walked to the window and looked at the calm sea outside. It seemed peaceful, but a silent evolutionary race was taking place underwater. First, we need to prepare an inhibitor production plan, he decided. But at the same time, we need to try to communicate with the bacterial membrane. Suian and Leewi were both stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Communication. How do we communicate? Since it can process information, it should be able to receive information. Lin Mo turned around. We can try using chemical signals, light signals, or even electrical signals to send its simple messages such as harmless, threat, or boundary. Let SC if it can understand them.</p>
<p>and if it will respond. That is too risky. Lewi said if it interprets our signals as a threat, it might launch a preemptive attack. Therefore, we need to conduct small-scale tests in a controlled environment. Linmo said, &quot;Use remote equipment and conduct the tests at a safe distance.</p>
<p>At the same time, prepare contingency plans so we can evacuate if things go wrong.&quot; Such an thought for a moment and nodded. theoretically feasible. Since the bacterial membrane network can transmit signals, it may have basic signal recognition capabilities. We can design a simple binary code and use light pulses of different frequencies or chemical concentration gradients to represent them. You design the experimental plan.</p>
<p>Linmo said, &quot;Lewi, prepare the equipment. The first test will begin in 3 days.&quot; Good. After the two left, Lin Mo returned to the command center. Chi and Duo Duo was waiting for him there, looking even worse than in the morning. Bad news cut to the chase.</p>
<p>Dragon Soul S nuclear submarine Deep Diver 3 entered the Dead Sea region half an hour ago at a depth of 300 m only 15 nautical miles from the fortress. They have deployed at least four unmanned underwater vehicles with their target clearly pointed at the side entrance of the Fortressa. What about the Brotherhood&#x27;s radicals? They were also approaching but slower. They might have discovered the dragon souls movements. Shien duo duo pulled up the surveillance footage.</p>
<p>What is more troublesome is that the coral society after receiving the report of explorer 7s loss of contact did not suspend their research has agreed. Instead, they sent a second ship with a team of armed security guards. Their reason was to recover the society s property and personnel. Dot. All three forces acted simultaneously with their target being the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>It seems everyone has smell blood. Lynn, Emmo calmly looked at the map. Notify Shir how to strengthen the base&#x27;s defenses, but don&#x27;t get involved in the conflict. Let dragon soul and the brotherhood run into trouble first. As for the Coral Society, tell them that we have salvaged the wreckage of Explorer 7 and are analyzing it.</p>
<p>If they want the data and the wreckage, negotiate according to the rules. Will they listen? No. But we could buy time. Lynamo said, &quot;Our focus is not on stopping them, but on completing our own preparations while they&#x27;re holding each other back.&quot; He pulled up the materials list for Sky City and looked at the densely packed entries. Most of the materials could be obtained through trade, but three core materials were marked as rare, found only in deep deposits in geologically active areas.</p>
<p>Are there any alternatives to these three materials? He asked Leewi. No. Dot. Leewi shook his head. They are key components of the Sky CDS energy core and structural framework.</p>
<p>The template instructions specifically emphasize that substitutes will cause a performance drop of more than 60%. And their use is not recommended. The Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active zone, yes, but the specific locations need to be explored. Dot leeway pointed to several areas on the map. These places have active submarine volcanoes which may form the high temperature and high pressure mineral deposits we need.</p>
<p>However, exploration and mining are extremely difficult and the environment is dangerous. Lynn MMO marked those areas. The closest one was 800 nautical miles away and it would take time to travel back and forth, not to mention facing the unknown underwater environment. Prepare an exploration vessel, he said. Bring the best equipment and sufficient self-defense forces.</p>
<p>We ll set off once the situation here stabilizes a bit. Dot. Who should we send? Algo. Linmo said such will stay at the base to continue her research on the microbial membrane. Sure.</p>
<p>How will be in charge of defense? Chin duo duo will be in charge of intelligence and Leewi, you will be in charge of technical support. Shanning may have other tasks. Dot. Just then, Chenning knocked and came in. His expression was strange, a mixture of confusion and a kind of uncertain expectation.</p>
<p>The Amble has replied, he said they agreed to negotiate but requested a neutral location and that Linmo go there in persona. Where is it located? An abandoned drilling platform on the edge of the Dead Sea, 40 nautical miles from our base and 30 nautical miles from the fortress. Chining projected the coordinates onto the map. He said it was far enough to see clearly. dot possibility of a trap very high, Chining said frankly.</p>
<p>But Amble has a peculiar trait. He likes to show off his plans before taking action. If we go, he might reveal some of his true intentions. Moreover, the fact that he specifically requested you to go in person means that he thinks you can make the decisions, which in itself is a form of approval. Dot.</p>
<p>Lyn Mo looked at the coordinates. The abandoned drilling platform surrounded by the sea on all sides offered a wide view and was indeed a good place for negotiations as well as an ambush. Prepare a speedboat and take four of your most reliable men. He decided you come with me and sure how will take three men to provide support from the outside. Only bring light weapons.</p>
<p>The focus should be on communication and evacuation equipment. What about time? Tomorrow at noon. The visibility will be better during the day and they&#x27;ll have less room to play tricks. Lin Mo said also contact Cars and ask if he can monitor that platform from the fortress. No need to interfere.</p>
<p>Just keep an eye on it to clear. That afternoon the Moyuan base entered a tense but orderly state of preparation. Shirhow inspected all the defense facilities and increased the number of coastal centuries. Such Chian Xian and Leewi were preparing equipment for the bofilm communication experiment in the laboratory, planning to begin immediately after the negotiations. Shiindu&#x27;s intelligence network was operating at full capacity, monitoring every tiny movement of Dragon Soul, the Brotherhood, and a Coral Society.</p>
<p>In the evening, Lynn Mo received a reply from Carl. The target platform is now under surveillance. Three heat sources have been detected, presumably from personnel lying in weight. The platform&#x27;s underwater structure shows signs of recent modifications, possibly indicating the installation of underwater propulsion or diving equipment. High vigilance is advised.</p>
<p>Additionally, there&#x27;s new progress in decrypting the final emergency protocol. The third layer of authorization requires civilization inheritor certification, but the system has detected a matching signal source approaching. The signal is indistinct. Approximately 300 nautical miles away and heading southeast. Tracking is ongoing.</p>
<p>Civilization inheritors approaching completion. Then Montac found it. This was yet another new variable. Could it be someone from the brotherhood or something else entirely? Before nightfall, he arrived at the dock alone. The exploration vessel Deep Blue was mored in its birth and workers were carrying out final maintenance.</p>
<p>This ship was originally used for marine geological surveys, but after being modified, it was equipped with stronger propulsion and protection, as well as a small drilling rig. An 800 nautical mile voyage, unknown seabed, mineral deposits, potential geological risks, and other forces that may be encountered along the way. It&#x27;s very risky, but we have to go. Without Sky City, Moan Pavilion would always be forced to react passively with it. They could take the initiative and truly establish themselves in this world.</p>
<p>Footsteps sounded behind her. Su Chanchian walked over carrying a small refrigerator. Bacterial film samples and analyzer. She handed a box to Lin Mo. If you encounter similar phenomena during your exploration, you can analyze them in time.</p>
<p>I have already set up an automatic detection program that will alarm as soon as it comes into contact with a bacterial film or active factors. Thank you. Lyn Mo took the box. I&#x27;m leaving the base in your care. I will protect our home.</p>
<p>Sue Chian looked at him earnestly. But you must also promise me that safety comes first. Whether it as negotiations or exploration materials can be found slowly, but you only have one life. D I see. The two stood side by side for a while, watching the last rays of the setting sun disappear below the horizon.</p>
<p>In the distance, the Dead Sea remained pitch black, but it was unusually quiet there tonight. Even the sound of the wind and waves was much quieter. It was like the calm before the storm. &quot;Be careful tomorrow,&quot; Su Chian said softly. &quot;The same to you.&quot; As night completely enveloped the sea, Lynn Emmo returned to the command center.</p>
<p>He gave a final check of the negotiation plan, exploration plan, and emergency evacuation route, confirming that every detail had been considered. He didn&#x27;t return to the lounge until 2:00 a.m. Lying in bed, eyes closed, but my mind was still racing. The Bofilm&#x27;s intelligence, the Dragon Souls submarines, the Brotherhood&#x27;s negotiations, the unknown inheritors of civilization, and the approaching signal source 300 nautical miles away. All the clues are like a net tightening around them.</p>
<p>You must find a breakthrough before the net tightens. Tomorrow, the outcome will be decided at the negotiating table. And in the more distant future, perhaps the answers they seek lie hidden in those unknown seabed mineral deposits. Chapter 154. Platform negotiation.</p>
<p>At 7:00 in the morning, a thin layer of mist covered the sea. The Mo Yuan Pavilion speedboat. The flying fish departed the dock and headed southwest toward the abandoned drilling platform. The engine roared low and the vessel moved at an economical speed, leaving a white trail on the calm sea. Lynn and Mo stood in the cockpit, looking through the front window at the gradually clearing horizon.</p>
<p>Chenning beside him checked the equipment. Two submachine guns for stun grenades and a portable signal jammer. The anvil likes to play psychological games. Chining said he might deliberately be late or set up some scare tactics. Dante get distracted.</p>
<p>Keep your rhythm. Dot. How much do you know about him? We worked together for 5 years. Dot. Chinyanging pushed the magazine into the gun with a click.</p>
<p>He asked the kind of person who s a typical tech fanatic. He believes that knowledge should be held by the elite and that the masses Dante deserve the power to change the world. In the brotherhood, he was one of the most radical members. He even thought that the conservatives were too weak. What is his attitude towards the fortress obsession? Chennying succinctly commented 3 years ago.</p>
<p>He advocated entering the fortress at any cost even at the risk of activation. Now he has proven right. Although the consequences were dire, he did get in. This will only make him more convinced of his own abilities. The speedboat continued its journey.</p>
<p>When it was 15 nautical miles from the platform, Lynn Mo initiated a signal scan. The screen displayed the electromagnetic environment around the platform. In addition to the regular communication frequencies, there were several unusual pulse signals spaced regularly resembling some kind of detection device. There an underwater sonar array. Chennying pointed to the screen.</p>
<p>Four transmitters covering a 300 m radius around the platform. Any submersible that gets closed will be detected immediately. Dot. The defenses are very tight. That is more like him.</p>
<p>Chennying said anvil likes to control every detail. The more meticulous he seems, the more it shows that he is insecure. Dot. When they were 10 nautical miles apart, an unfamiliar voice came through the communicator. horse and with a synthesized electronic quality.</p>
<p>Flying fish, please confirm your identity. Channing glanced at Linmo, then picked up the microphone. This is Channing here to negotiate as agreed. Mr. Lynmo is with me.</p>
<p>After a brief silence, the voice rang out again. Approach permitted. More at birth number three on the east side of the platform. Only two people are allowed on the platform. Weapons must remain on board.</p>
<p>We will conduct an inspection. Clear. Eight nautical miles, five nautical miles, three nautical miles. The abandoned drilling platform gradually came into view. It was an old-fashioned forpost platform, rusty and with obvious signs of fire damage to the superructure.</p>
<p>The original drilling equipment had long been removed, leaving only an empty steel frame. New guardrails and lighting equipment had been installed around the platform&#x27;s edges, and several people in gray uniforms were walking on the deck. The flying fish slowly approached birth number three. A metal staircase next to the birth led directly to the upper deck. Lin Mo and Shiening left their weapons in the cockpit, taking only their communicators and recording devices.</p>
<p>As they ascended the stairs, two armed guards approached and professionally conducted a body search. After confirming they were unarmed, they were signaled to continue upwards. The top floor of the platform had been converted into a makeshift conference room. a long metal table, several folding chairs, and a map of the sea, and structural drawings hung on the wall. A tall man with broad shoulders and neatly trimmed short graying hair stood with his back to them in front of the map.</p>
<p>He turned around, revealing a sharply defined face. He was around 50 years old with deep set eyes, a hybrid nose, and a faint scar on his chin. His eyes were iron gray, and he looked at people as if he were appraising an object. Andel Shadowbringer he spoke first his voice lower than it had been over the phone. Three years have passed and UV he chosen the other side.</p>
<p>I chose rationality chinnying said calmly. What about my mentor? Is he all right? Carl made his choice. The anvil didn&#x27;t te answer directly just as Uve made yours. Sit down to the three took their seats. Iron Anvil&#x27;s gaze turned to Lin Mo scrutinizing him for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo, the leader of the Inc. Abyss Pavilion. I&#x27;ve seen you in intelligence reports. You look younger than in the photos. Let&#x27;s talk straight, Lynn Mo, said.</p>
<p>What do you want? The Andel smiled, but the smile was faint and devoid of warmth. Frankness. I like that. Dot. He leaned forward, elbows on the table.</p>
<p>I want the fortresses complete technology database, especially the sections on ecological modification and energy systems. In exchange, the Brotherhood radicals will cease all operations against the fortress and I can provide some intelligence you need. For example, for example, dragon soulless nuclear submarines are mapping the fortresses weak points. Anvil said, for example, the Coral Society is cultivating mutant strains of bofilm in an attempt to create controllable biological weapons. For example, we detected the approaching signal of the civilization inheritors earlier than you did.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo remained expressionless, but a slight tension gripped his heart. The anvil possessed more information than he had anticipated. &quot;We can&#x27;t he give away the technical database,&quot; he said. &quot;But we can share research findings regularly, provided that security is insured. As for intelligence, we can exchange other resources if you can provide something valuable.&quot; Dot.</p>
<p>Research findings. The anvil smile vanished. Secondhand data that has been screened, filtered, and censored. I want the original data, the designer&#x27;s complete thought process, not the leftovers you&#x27;ve digested. Raw data is too dangerous.</p>
<p>The lessons of Wings of Liberty are still fresh in our minds. The Wings of Liberty are fools that anvil made no attempt to hide his contempt. They think that violence can control everything. But true control comes from understanding. Deep and thorough understanding.</p>
<p>I have that ability. And you don T dot. Chinning interjected. It took our mentor 3 years to barely fix the security protocol. What makes you think you could do better? Because Carl&#x27;s is a scholar and I am an engineer.</p>
<p>Amble said scholars strive for perfection while engineers strive for practicality. I don&#x27;t need to fully understand it. I just need to know how to use it. Dot. The atmosphere in the meeting room became tense.</p>
<p>Lynmo was silent for a moment then changed direction. What are the inheritors of civilization you mentioned? The anvil glanced at him, seemingly assessing how much to say. It s recorded in the Brotherhood s his historical records. He concluded the civilization that built the fortress left behind several inheritors before they left not people but some kind of information carrier that recorded their complete history and technology tree. When a civilization faces extinction, the inheritors are activated to find suitable recipients.</p>
<p>What are the activation requirements? I don&#x27;t know, but the conditions are clearly met now that the anvil pointed southeast out the window. 3 days ago, we detected an unusual energy signal coming from the deep sea and then it began to move slowly. The direction was initially northwest, then turned due north and now at S facing this area. The speed is very slow, about 30 nautical miles a day, but very stable. Dot.</p>
<p>Have you tried to make contact? We tried but failed. For the first time, a look of frustration appeared on Iron Ambble&#x27;s face. The unmanned underwater vehicles we sent out all lost contact when they got within 5 nautical miles. There was some kind of defensive field around the signal source with an absurdly high intensity. The only gain was a blurry image.</p>
<p>He took a printed photo from under the table and pushed it over. The photo was taken in deep sea conditions, and the image quality is rough, but a general outline can be discerned. It is a spindle-shaped object about 50 m long with a smooth surface and no obvious propulsion devices or openings around it. The seawater appears abnormally distorted as if disturbed by a strong energy field. This isn&#x27;t a fortress-like structure.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo observed carefully. It looks more like a mode of transportation or rather a messenger. The anvil said, &quot;If it is truly a heir, then it carries the legacy of an entire civilization. Whoever obtains it first holds the key to the next aerod.&quot; Lyno pushed the photo back. So, you want the fortress&#x27;s technology to enhance your strength, so you can compete for the inheritance.</p>
<p>It s mutually beneficial. Iron amble. Didn&#x27;t he deny it? You control the fortress, but lack the ability to explore the deep sea. We have equipment and experience, but lack core technology. If we cooperate, we both have a chance.</p>
<p>If we fight, the dragon soul or the coral academy will ultimately benefit. Dot. The logic was clear, but Linmo didn&#x27;t believe it. A person like Iron Anvil will not be content with cooperation. He wants complete control.</p>
<p>We can cooperate in exploring the inheritors, Linmo said. But the conditions will change. First, the Brotherhood must cease all unauthorized fortress research. Second, all intelligence regarding the inheritors must be shared. And third, the exploration operation will be jointly commanded by both sides.</p>
<p>With the results shared, the ambles stared at him for a long time. Then he stood up and walked to the window. Young men, Yuvie, he got one thing wrong. He said his back to them. I&#x27;m not asking for your cooperation.</p>
<p>I am giving you a choice. Hand over the technology database and you can gracefully exit this game. Dante handed over Dot. He turned around, a dangerous glint in his iron gray eyes. Dragon Souls submarine is just 30 nautical miles away.</p>
<p>All I need to do is send a signal to tell them your location on the platform and provide some evidence proving that Mo Yuan Pavilion is plotting to use fortress technology to create ecological weapons. Do you think the LL just launched torpedoes? The shadowy figure pressed his hand on the table, his knuckles turning white. Are you crazy? that would trigger a fullscale war. The war started long ago, the anvil said calmly. You&#x27;ve just been pretending to be at peace.</p>
<p>Now give me the answer. Database or war? The conference room was deathly silent. Lynn Mo slowly stood up and looked directly into the eyes of the anvil. I choose the third path, he said. Right now, let dragon soul know your location.</p>
<p>At the same time, I will send all the intelligence on the Brotherhood s radicals, including evidence of your illegal exploration over the past three years to the Dragon Soul leadership and the Brotherhood s conservatives. We&#x27;ll all go down together. How about that? The Anvil&#x27;s expression froze. He hadn&#x27;t expected this reaction. You wouldn&#x27;t dare, he said, his voice lowering.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s give it a try. Lyn Mo picked up the communicator. Shadowbringer, contact base and prepare to send. Wait. The anvil interrupted him.</p>
<p>Silence filled the room. The ticking of the second hand was clearly audible. Finally, the anvil sat back down in the chair, and the smile reappeared. But this time, it had something different. Not a threat, but a complex, almost admiring emotion.</p>
<p>Fine, you ruthless, he said. I take back what I just said. Let us talk on your terms, dot. Over the next 2 hours, the two sides finalized a preliminary cooperation framework. The Brotherhood&#x27;s Radical Faction provided the Inheritors real-time coordinates and detection data, while the Inc.</p>
<p>Abyss Pavilion contributed some of the Fortress&#x27;s environmental technology for modifying deep sea exploration equipment. The two sides jointly formed an exploration team with command rotating among themselves and all discoveries shared. The agreement is fragile, but it at least temporarily averts direct conflict. The negotiations ended at noon. When they left the platform, the anvil escorted them to the stairwell.</p>
<p>Shadowbringer, he called his former colleague. Carl is still alive. I asenti he chinning stopped in her tracks without turning around. He chose his own path. Tell him.</p>
<p>Iron Amble paused that I have no regrets about what happened back then. But if I had the chance, I would have done it differently. Dot. After a few seconds of silence, Chennying nodded. On the speedboat back, the fog on the sea had dissipated.</p>
<p>The sunlight was dazzling and the seaater shimmerred with light. Do you think he will abide by the agreement? Lynn Emmo asked in the short term. Do Chinnying watch the platform disappear into the distance. Iron Anvil is very practical. There is no benefit for him to fight us headon now.</p>
<p>But once he gets enough technology or the position of the successor is secured, he will definitely turn against us. Dot. Therefore, we must prepare in advance. The communicator rang. It was Chin Duwa&#x27;s voice visibly tense.</p>
<p>Mr. Lynn, the Dragon Soul submarine, suddenly dived to its maximum depth and disappeared 10 minutes ago. Our sonar has completely lost its signal. Meanwhile, the Coral Society&#x27;s second ship is heading at full speed toward the edge of the Dead Sea and is expected to arrive in an hour. Anything else? There&#x27;s new information from Cars.</p>
<p>He says the Inheritor&#x27;s signal has accelerated. It&#x27;s now traveling at 5 knots hour and its direction has been slightly adjusted. Heading straight for the fortress. All clues are closing in like a net. Lynn Mo gazed at the sea ahead where the outline of the Mo Yuan pavilion&#x27;s base was already faintly visible.</p>
<p>Notify everyone. Emergency meeting. We have new work to do. Chapter 155. Beyond the firewall.</p>
<p>The emergency meeting of Mayuan Pavilion was held in a small conference room next to the command center. There was no projector, no printed materials, only a handdrawn map of the sea area spread out on the long table with the positions and movements of various forces marked on it with different color markers. Lynn, Emo stood in front of the map holding a black marker. Chining, Su Chan, Leewi, Chin, Duo, Duo, and Sha sat around the table each with a notebook open in front of them. The current situation Lynn Mo pointed to the southeast of the map with the tip of his pen is that the inheritor or rather that unknown signal source is approaching the fortress at a speed of 5 knots hour.</p>
<p>At this speed, it will reach the outer edge of the Dead Sea in at the earliest 72 hours dot. He drew a red circle in that spot. Dragon Souls submarine Deep Diver 3 suddenly submerged and disappeared during our negotiations with Anvil. The last sonar contact was at the southeastern edge of the Dead Sea at a depth of 600 meters. The submarine&#x27;s last location was marked with a black marker.</p>
<p>The Coral Society&#x27;s second research vessel, Seeker of Knowledge, is expected to arrive at the edge of the Dead Sea in 1 hour. Armed security personnel are on board ostensibly to recover the wreckage and personnel of Explorer 7. Blue marker. The five ships of the Brotherhood&#x27;s radical faction have not made any new move for the time being. But according to the agreement, the anvil should send the inheritors real-time data within two hours.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#x27;t, Lenimo paused for a moment and looked at Chining. He will send it, Shadow said. At least until he gets what he wants. Amvil will abide by part of the agreement. That s is rule of the game.</p>
<p>Okay. Linmo continued, our response plan consists of three steps. First, monitoring and intelligence. Second, technical preparation, and third, contingency plans. Dot.</p>
<p>He wrote three titles in his notebook. Manager Chien is in charge of monitoring. Mobilize all resources to keep a close eye on the inheritors movements while also keeping an eye on the dragon soul and coral society&#x27;s activities, especially the Dragon Soul submarine. I don&#x27;t believe it can just disappear in a thin air. Sh.</p>
<p>And Duodu nodded and quickly took notes. Leeway is in charge of the technical preparations. We need a plan that allows us to safely access the inheritors. Cars has found some relevant information in the Fortress database and is organizing it. You&#x27;re in charge of the coordination, assessing which technologies we can implement and which require Fortress support.</p>
<p>Leeway pushed up his glasses. Time is tight, but I will do my best. Suchan continue your research on the microbial membrane, but adjust the priority. Linmo looked at her. I need to know how the microbial membrane will react if the inheritor approaches or if a dragon soul or the coral society makes large-scale moves in the Dead Sea region.</p>
<p>It has an unpredictable variable right now. Su Chian closed her notebook. The experiment has been designed and we can start testing the communication with the bacterial membrane tonight. But I need Chinyings help. The Brotherhood may have some research materials on bio signal coding.</p>
<p>Chining nodded. I&#x27;ll organize it for you. Sure, how strengthen defenses, especially underwater vigilance, Lynn Mo concluded. We don&#x27;t know what the inheritors will bring, nor do we know what other forces will do. The safety of the base is the bottom line.</p>
<p>Understood. Sure&#x27;s reply was brief and forceful. The meeting lasted 40 minutes. After it ended, everyone went their separate ways. Lyn Mo didn&#x27;t leave the conference room.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the map, staring at the red circle. Five knots per hour, not fast in the deep sea, but terrifyingly stable. It was like some kind of pre-programmed automatic navigation system, unaffected by ocean currents, terrain, or even time. What exactly is the Inheritor? The Anvil describes it as an information carrier recording the complete history and technology of a lost civilization. But if it&#x27;s merely a storage device, why has it moved? Why has it appeared now? And what are the activation conditions? Too many questions, too few answers.</p>
<p>At 300 p.m., Chin Duo Duo brought the first intelligence update. The signal characteristics of the inheritor have changed that he pointed to the spectrum analysis chart. In addition to the original low-frequency pulses, there are now highfrequency modulated signals like some kind of broadcast. We&#x27;re trying to decode it, but the signal encryption method is very special and existing algorithms cannot crack it. Broadcast range.</p>
<p>Currently, it only covers a spherical area with a radius of about 20 nautical miles. But if it continues to approach the fortress, the distance between them will shrink to within 10 nautical miles. At that point, the fortress system may be able to react to it. Lynn Mo frowned. What&#x27;s the reaction? I don&#x27;t know, but Carr said that the Fortresses S logs mentioned the inheritor protocol, which seems to be some kind of interactive program reserved by the designers.</p>
<p>The specific content requires higher privileges to access and he currently only has permanent administrator privileges one level away from being available. It&#x27;s a permissions issue again. Let him keep trying. Also ask him how risky it would be if we sent someone to contact the successor now. IV already asked that she duo duo smiled Riley.</p>
<p>His reply was not recommended. The defense mechanisms of unknown systems could be fatal. Then he attached a document which was a record of defense systems found in other ruins of that civilization, including energy weapons, biological toxins, and even space-time distortion fields. Though, this doesn&#x27;t sound like good news at all. At 5:00 p.m., Such Chian and Shanning came to find Linmo with a preliminary experimental results.</p>
<p>In a biology lab, the bacterial film sample in the petri dish responded to a specific light signal. When Sue Chanchian flashed a red LED at a preset frequency, the network electrical pulse activity of the bacterial film significantly increased and new veins grew towards the light source. It can recognize simple signal patterns. Do Sue Chantian pulled up the data chart. It has not just a reaction but also signs of learning after the same set of signals was repeated three times.</p>
<p>The reaction time of the bacterial membrane shortened from 12 seconds to 3 seconds. On the fourth time, it even made preparatory adjustments before we issued the signal dot. On the screen, the fluorescent markers of the bacterial membrane network begin to redistribute half a second before the signal is emitted as if they anticipate the upcoming stimulus. This is no longer a simple conditioned reflex. Dotching stared at the screen.</p>
<p>It has formed a kind of expected pattern. It s like when you train a dog. You give it food every time you ring a bell and after a few times the dog will salivate when it hears the bell dot. But it s just a collection of microorganisms. Leewi said incredulously.</p>
<p>Ant colonies can solve complex path problems and be colonies can build precise hexagonal nests. Such an key to swarm intelligence is not how smart the individuals are, but how they cooperate. Now that the microbial biofilm has an efficient chemical signal transduction network, it is entirely possible for it to evolve into rudimentary intelligence dot. She switched the experimental log. What&#x27;s more troublesome is that when I tried to convey the concept of boundary using signal combinations, for example, using a specific pattern to represent cannot be crossed, the bacterial film started actively testing the boundary.</p>
<p>After the third experiment, it grew tentacle-like structures, carefully protruding out of the marked area and then quickly retracting as if assessing the risk. Lynn Emmo watched the experimental videos. The grayish white bacterial film slowly writhed in the petri dish like living mucus. When it extended its tentacles beyond the boundary, its movements were cautious and purposeful, completely unlike random growth. If we establish stable signal communication with it, can we negotiate? Maybe it is possible, but it will take time, Sue Chan said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the premise of negotiation is that both sides have common interests or threats. What are the interests of the bacterial film right now? Survival, expansion. We dine know its goals, so we dine know what can be used as a bargaining chip. Dot. Silence fell over the laboratory.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the sky began to darken. At 700 p.m., Sherhow brought a report on the completion of the defense deployment along with some bad news. The patrol team spotted an unidentified submersible 30 nautical miles east of the base. He placed a photo on the table, small, unmarked, and silent. Our sonar almost missed it.</p>
<p>After being detected, it quickly submerged and fled. The photo is blurry. Only a streamlined outline can be seen, approximately 5 m long. It has not standard equipment from Dragon Soul. Nor is it a model commonly seen in the Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Chining analyzed. The Coral Society does have similar research submersibles, but they usually Dante operate this discreetly. Dot. Have you tracked it down? No. It entered the deep sea canyon area where the terrain is complex and the sonar is ineffective.</p>
<p>Sure house said, but judging from the direction it fled, it may have come from the southeast direction from which the inheritor came. Dot. another new variable. At 900 p.m., Carl sent an urgent communication from the Fortress. The signal strength of the inheritor is continuously increasing.</p>
<p>The fortress&#x27;s level 2 alert protocol has been triggered. The system has automatically activated three deep sea monitoring arrays, which are currently collecting data. Preliminary analysis shows that the inheritor&#x27;s energy characteristics are 73% similar to the fortress&#x27;s core energy system, but the technological approach is significantly different. It may have used a more advanced energy conversion principle. Additionally, synchronized responses were detected in the bacterial biofilm in the Dead Sea region.</p>
<p>The frequency of electrical impulse activity in the biofilm network correlates with the signal modulation frequency of the inheritors. The two may be communicating in some way. Adelog, are the bacterial film and the inheritor communicating? Limo immediately contacted Sukianken. 10 minutes later, she rushed into the command center holding a freshly printed data chart. She right.</p>
<p>Such Chian spread the drawings on the table. Look here. Over the past 2 hours, the network activity of the bacterial membrane has shown obvious periodic fluctuations. The timing of the peaks and troughs corresponds exactly to the fluctuations in the strength of the inheritor s signal. The error is no more than 2 seconds dot.</p>
<p>Is it a coincidence? The probability is less than one in a thousand, Sue Chansian said with certainty. Moreover, the fluctuation pattern is changing. At first, it was simple synchronization, but now there&#x27;s a more complex interaction. And the activity of the bacterial membrane changes first and the inheritor s signal adjusts accordingly as if in response to what does this mean? Is the mcelium actively contacting the inheritor or is the inheritor sending instructions to the mcelium? Can Carl&#x27;s interpret what they&#x27;re saying? Lynn Mo asked. No, the signal encoding method is unknown.</p>
<p>However, the system recorded a similar pattern during the early stages of the fortress&#x27;s construction. The designers tested information exchange between distributed ecological units. The records at that time described it as a basic ecological coordination protocol. Basic ecosystem coordination protocol. It sounds like a communication standard designed to enable different ecosystem components to work together.</p>
<p>If the bacterial biofilm is one kind of ecological unit, then the inheritor is another ecological unit. Could they be different parts of the same system? Lewi suddenly asked. The fortress is the environmental transformation and production center. The microbial membrane is the ecological execution unit. And the inheritor is the information and control center.</p>
<p>This speculation sent chills down everyone&#x27;s spine. If this is the case, then the approach of the inheritors to the fortress is not accidental, but rather a systemic reunion. When the three components reconnect, the complete system will activate and execute its predetermined final task. That mission is likely to completely transform Earth&#x27;s ecosystem according to the blueprint. We must prevent them from making contact, Lynn Mo said.</p>
<p>But how to stop them? The inheritors reside in the deep sea. Their speed stable, their defenses unknown. The bofilm covers vast areas of the ocean and is still evolving intelligence. Although the fortress is under control, its basic programs may still be responding to the systems call. There are less than 70 hours left.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m., the anvil will deliver the inheritor&#x27;s real-time data packet as promised. The data was more detailed than expected. Precise coordinates, depth, velocity, energy readings, and even chemical composition analysis of the surrounding water. The accompanying note was only one sentence. Sincere cooperation.</p>
<p>We look forward to your return. Lynmo asked Leewayi to verify the authenticity of the data. Half an hour later, Leewi confirmed that the data was reliable and more accurate than what they had monitored themselves. The anvils detection equipment is more advanced than ours. He admitted the Brotherhood does have experience in deep sea exploration.</p>
<p>Dot. Then let us put it to use. Linmo said, &quot;Analyze the Inheritor S movement trajectory and predict the precise time and location when it arrives at the Dead Sea. At the same time, calculate how much power we would need to intercept it now and what the probability of success would be.&quot; Dot intercept. Sure, Hal frowned.</p>
<p>What can we use to intercept them? Our fleet is mainly for patrol and transportation. It doesn&#x27;t have deep sea combat capabilities. Use the fortress. Everyone looked at Linmo. The fortress has a defense system and deep sea mobility, Lynn Mo said.</p>
<p>Although most of its functions are currently restricted, the basic defense modules are still intact. If we temporarily adjust the permissions, allowing Carl to control the fortress to move onto the inheritor&#x27;s path. It s too risky to Chining shook his head. A mobile fortress would generate huge energy fluctuations which could be detected immediately by the dragon soul and other forces. Moreover, if the inheritor s defense system is stronger than expected, the two may clash and the consequences are unpredictable.</p>
<p>But if we do nothing and let them come into contact, the consequences will be even more unpredictable. Lynmo said, &quot;We need to make a choice between the two.&quot; Dot. The debate continued until 1:00 a.m. Ultimately, they reached a compromise. The fortress would remain stationary for the time being, but preparations would be made for relocation at any time.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a small team would be dispatched in a modified deep sea submersible to attempt contact with the inheritor from a safe distance, assessing its defensive capabilities and intentions. The team is led by Chining with Leewi providing technical support. Departure is scheduled for tomorrow morning. After the meeting, Linmo did not return to the lounge. He went to the pier and looked at the sea in the night.</p>
<p>In the distance, the direction of the Dead Sea remains pitch black. But if you look closely, you&#x27;ll notice an extremely faint pulsating fluoresence at the edge of that darkness sits the bacterial film moving. Beyond the fog wall, the unknown is approaching. And every decision they make could lead to a completely different future. At 2:00 in the morning, Sue Chan found him holding a thermos in her hand.</p>
<p>Have something hot to drink? She handed me the cup. What are you thinking about? I wonder if we on the right track. Do Lyno took the cup. The warmth of the hot tea seeping through the cup. All the clues point in the same direction.</p>
<p>A larger system, more complex relationships, and more dangerous unknowns. Sometimes I wonder if things would be simpler now if we hadn&#x27;t he entered the fortress and hadn&#x27;t he fixed the security protocols. But in that case, the fortress might still be forcibly implementing the blueprint, and the Dead Sea might have already expanded to the entire sea area. Sue Chanchian leaned against the railing next to him. We made the choice we could at the time.</p>
<p>As for the consequences, we can only face them, dot. She looked out at the sea. You know, there&#x27;s a concept in biology called the red queen hypothesis. It means that in evolution you have to keep running just to stay in the same place because the environment is changing and the competitors are changing. Stagnation is equivalent to extinction.</p>
<p>We are running now. At least we still running. Su Chian said and weary not running alone. We have a team technology a fortress and each other. Dot.</p>
<p>Lin mo turned to look at her in a moonlight. Her profile was clearly defined and her eyes were resolute. Thank you, he said. You&#x27;re welcome. Go back and rest now.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a tough battle to fight tomorrow. At 3:00 a.m., most of the lights in the base were turned off. But in the biology lab, the bacterial film in the petri dish was still slowly undulating. The monitor&#x27;s records showed its electrical impulse patterns becoming increasingly complex, as if it were practicing a new language. 300 nautical miles to the southeast, the spindle-shaped object was steadily moving forward in the deep sea.</p>
<p>Its surface was as smooth as a mirror, reflecting the cold light of deep sea creatures. Inside it, a program is running. Distance to target 68 hours and 12 minutes. Agreement status pending activation. Ecological unit detection confirmed to exist.</p>
<p>Environmental assessment in progress. The deep sea is silent, but change has already begun. At 4:00 a.m., the modified deep sea submersible Explorer 2 was ready. This ship was larger than the one Linmo and his team had used last time with additional sensor arrays and robotic arms installed on the hall. The interior space could barely accommodate six people, but only three were going on this mission.</p>
<p>Chining as the team leader, Leewei in charge of technical operations, and Lao Chun, an experienced deep sea pilot. At the dock, Sue Chian packed and secured the last batch of equipment. She handed Chenning a small biological monitoring device, only the size of a palm, its casing tightly sealed. &quot;If it gets close to the inheritor, the surrounding microbial environment may undergo special changes,&quot; she said. This instrument can analyze gene fragments and metabolites in water in real time which may provide clues.</p>
<p>Chining took the instrument and checked the battery level. Any new discoveries over the bacterial film? The signal experiment is still ongoing but something is strange. Su Chanhan lowered her voice last night. In the latter half of the night, the pulsating activity of the bacterial film suddenly showed a period of regular intervals of silence, once every three minutes, each lasting 10 seconds. It was as if it was waiting for a response.</p>
<p>Has the signal from the successor changed? The same silent pattern appeared simultaneously. Su Chian said, &quot;This can be a coincidence. They&#x27;re indeed communicating and it is becoming more and more regular.&quot; Chining nodded, making the information a memory. He turned and boarded the submersible where Leewi and Laochan were already conducting final system checks. The hatch closed and the ceiling latch made a familiar clicking sound.</p>
<p>Explorer 2 requests to depart. Old Chin&#x27;s voice came through the communicator. Departure approved. Drive carefully. Lynn Emmo responded from the command center.</p>
<p>The submersible slowly sank into the water. Its thrusters activated and it turned southeast. The lights at the stern gradually faded into the dark sea. eventually disappearing from sight. Lynamo stood on the dock for a while until the sea had completely calmed down before turning back to the command center.</p>
<p>At 7:00 a.m., the submersible had already traveled 100 nautical miles. The depth was maintained at 300 m, a depth that allowed it to avoid most surface disturbances without experiencing excessive pressure. Inside the cabin, Leeway stared at the three screens in front of him. On the left was the real-time trajectory map of the Inheritor. In the middle was the status data of a deep sea submersible and on the right was the external environmental monitoring.</p>
<p>All readings were within the normal range. Old Shun was a tacetern middle-aged man who had worked in a marine exploration team for 20 years. He operated the submersible with skill and precision, hardly needing to look at the instruments, maintaining course and depth stability entirely by feel. We are 180 nautical miles from the target. Leeway reported, &quot;At the current speed, we expect to make contact in 5 hours.</p>
<p>Slow down to 15 knots.&quot; Chining said, &quot;We need to be even more careful once we within 100 nautical miles.&quot; Dot. Old Chin nodded and adjusted the thruster power. The submersible speed decreased and the engine noise became almost inaudible. At 9:00 a.m., Shin Duo Duo sent the first intelligence update. &quot;Dragons submarine has reappeared,&quot; he said in the communications channel.</p>
<p>It s located on the southeastern edge of the dead sea at a depth of 400 meters and it is stationary. Also the coral society seeker of knowledge has arrived at the location where explorer 7 lost contact and is salvaging the wreckage. They re using heavy lifting equipment. It looks like they re try and tow the entire wreckage away. Dot.</p>
<p>Let them tow it away. Lyno said the wreckage is of little value now. Focus on monitoring the dragon soul submarines movements. Understood. There&#x27;s one more thing.</p>
<p>The Brotherhood&#x27;s radical fleet has started moving also southeast, but very slowly, as if they&#x27;re waiting for something. Wait, wait for the successor to approach, or wait for the deep sea submersible to explore the way first. Lynn Emmo forwarded this information to Chenning. A few minutes later, Chenning replied with a brief two-word message, received. At 11:00 a.m., the submersible entered a 100 nautical mile zone around the inheritor.</p>
<p>The environment began to change. The temperature sensors were the first to detect it. The seawater temperature was a full 2° higher than expected, and this anomaly was spherically distributed, spreading outwards from the inheritor. The temperature gradient was very uniform, unlike a naturally occurring heat source. Then came the changes in water quality.</p>
<p>Leeway analyzed the water samples and found that the concentration of dissolved metal ions in the water was abnormally high, especially several rare earth elements with concentrations hundreds of times higher than in normal seawater. These ions formed a clear concentration gradient around the inheritor like some kind of chemical wake. It seems to be actively releasing these substances. Leeway stared at the data, but the purpose is unclear. It could be a byproduct of the energy system or it could be marking territori.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is the biological activity. Normally marine life should avoid areas with such abnormal temperature and water quality. But monitoring shows that a large number of deep sea bioluminescent organisms, lantern fish, deep sea shrimp, siphonophores, and so on gathered around the inheritor. They did not approach but swam around it at a certain distance like pilgrims surrounding a sacred site. The creatures are attracted.</p>
<p>Dot. Shinying observed the footage, transmitted from the external camera. Their swimming patterns are very regular, not random. Dot. Old Chin stopped the submersible at a safe distance and activated the hovering mode.</p>
<p>The hull hovered silently in the 300 me deep water like a lurking hunter. What do we do now? He asked. Observe first, Chinning said. Leeway. activate all passive sensors and collect complete data, especially that highfrequency modulation signal.</p>
<p>Try to analyze its pattern dot. Leewi began his work. The sensor array operated at full power, recording every subtle signal emitted by the inheritor. The spectrum on the screen was as complex as an abstract painting with lines of different colors intertwining and forming patterns that were difficult to decipher. Time passed second by second.</p>
<p>At 100 p.m., the inheritor suddenly changed his behavior. The faint light on its surface began to flicker regularly, the frequency gradually increasing from once per second to five times per second. At the same time, visible disturbances appeared in the water around it. Not currents, but more subtle ripples as if space itself was trembling slightly. The energy field is increasing.</p>
<p>Dot leeways voice tightened. The reading has exceeded the safety threshold by three times. We recommend retreating dot. Wait a little longer. Chining stare at the screen.</p>
<p>What is it showing? Or rather, what is it testing? Sure enough, after a dozen seconds, the frequency of the flashing lights stabilized, forming a repeating sequence. Three short, three long, three short. Leeway was stunned. This is he quickly typed on the keyboard. Morse code SOS.</p>
<p>No, a light signal in the deep sea. Perhaps it s a general distress signal or its indicating harmlessness. The shadow said try to respond. Send the same sequence using the array of lights weary carrying dot. Three sets of high brightness LEDs on the top of the submersible lit up.</p>
<p>The submersible manually controlled the switches repeating the sequence of three short, three long, and three short lights. Sending complete. Everyone held their breath. 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds. The light emanating from the inheritor suddenly went out completely.</p>
<p>The deep sea was plunged into complete darkness. Only the lights of the submersible illuminated a small patch of water along with the luminous creatures that circled around it like stars in the night sky. Then a glimmer of light reemerged on the surface of the inheritor. Instead of the previous uniform glow, it became a single point, a tiny bright point. That point began to move, tracing intricate paths across the smooth surface of the inheritor.</p>
<p>Leeway increased the camera sensitivity to record the complete pattern. It was a geometric shaped three intersecting rings each with fine engravings inside this pattern. The shadow s voice changed. IV seen it in the fortress s archives. It as the symbol of the designer civilization and also the symbol of their highest authority.</p>
<p>The three rings remained on the surface of the inheritor for about 10 seconds before fading away. The light was redistributed evenly, restoring the previous state. It s identifying itself, Chining said, or verifying our identities. How should we respond? Leewi asked. We don&#x27;t have the symbols of that civilization, nor do we know their verification methods.</p>
<p>Use the fortress&#x27;s access, Shadow decided. Carl&#x27;s gave us a temporary verification code for system integration in emergencies. Maybe we can use it here to He pulled up an encrypted file from the console, entered the password and opened it. Inside was a complex string of geometric symbols. Supposedly the digital signature used by the designer.</p>
<p>How can we send it? Light signals cannot transmit such complex information. You sound waves. Old Chin suddenly said, &quot;The sonar of a deep sea submersible can emit modulated signals. Although the bandwidth is limited, it should be enough.&quot; Dot. They quickly devised a plan.</p>
<p>Leeway converted the geometric code into a soundwave modulation sequence. And Lao Chin adjusted the sonar emission angle, aiming it at the inheritor. Ready to send, the shadow took a deep breath. 3 2 1. The sonar emitted a series of crisp pulses.</p>
<p>In a deep sea, sound travels fast and far. The circling bioluminescent creatures were startled and scattered, but quickly regrouped. The transmission lasted for 30 seconds. Then came the waiting again. This time the response came very quickly.</p>
<p>Light spots reappeared on the surface of the inheritor. This time drawing a different pattern. A simple arrow pointing downwards. Is it guiding away? Lewi asked puzzled. Not below.</p>
<p>Dot. Shinning stared at the pattern. Judging from the angle of the arrow, it s pointing to the seabed dot. He pulled up a map of the seabed. The inheritor was currently suspended above a deep sea canyon below which lay a seabed 4,000 m deep.</p>
<p>The terrain there was complex dotted with hydrothermal vents and mineral veins. Where does it want us to go? Or perhaps it s tried to tell us what s there. Chining pondered. Old Shun, descend to a safe depth and carefully scan the canyon area with the terrain scanner dot. The submersible began its slow descent.</p>
<p>The depth gauge readings continued to increase. 400 m, 500 m, 600 m. At a depth of 800 m, the terrain scanner transmitted clear images. At the bottom of the canyon, there&#x27;s a clearly visible man-made structure. It&#x27;s neither a building nor a shipwreck, but a huge metallic disc over a 100 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>The disc surface is covered with the same geometric patterns with a central depression resembling a giant socket or connector. Around the disc, some things were scattered. Leeway zoomed in on the image and gasped. There were more spindle-shaped objects identical to the inheritor, but all motionless, their surfaces dull and lifeless. Some were intact, others were broken, their internal structures exposed.</p>
<p>A rough estimate puts at least 20 of them on the table. Is this a parking lot? Old Chin murmured. Or a cemetery. Chining counted the stationary objects, then looked at the still glowing inheritor. Perhaps they&#x27;re all waiting, he said, waiting to be activated, waiting for instructions, or waiting to go home.</p>
<p>Dot. The submersible continued its descent, hovering at a height of 300 m above the disc. This distance was safe enough and allowed for clear observation of details. In a recessed center of the disc, there&#x27;s a clearly visible interface structure. the shape of which perfectly matches the outline of the successor&#x27;s tail.</p>
<p>A ring of indicator lights surrounds the interface, all of which are currently off. So, the successor is supposed to come and take over, Leeway understood. But why is it stopping here and not continuing? Is it waiting for some condition or it might be waiting for us? Chinyanging said it took the initiative to contact us and show us the location, perhaps wanting us to help it complete the docking dot. What can we do? I don&#x27;t know. Dot.</p>
<p>Shinning shook his head, but at least now we know its purpose. It s not here to attack or occupy it. S carrying out a preset mission to go home or to deliver a message. Lyn Mo&#x27;s voice came through the communicator from the command center. Chinnying, &quot;How&#x27;s the situation?&quot; The shadowy figure gave a brief report on the discovery.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Lyn Mo said, &quot;Let&#x27;s withdraw first. We need to reassess. If the successor really just wants to make connections, then maybe it&#x27;s not a threat, but we need to know what will happen after the connections are made. Understood, said the shadow. We&#x27;ll continue its journey after we leave.</p>
<p>Monitoring data shows that since you sent the verification code, its speed has dropped to zero and it has completely stopped. Lynn Mo said is waiting for your response or waiting for your decision. Dot. The submersible began to surface. Before leaving, Chinning took one last look at the disc and the surrounding stationary objects.</p>
<p>In the eternal darkness of the deep sea, they were like slumbering behemoths, awaiting their awakening. The luminous creatures that surrounded him remained faithfully around the inheritor, as if guarding something sacred. At 300 p.m., the submersible surfaced. The sunlight was blinding, and the sea breeze carried a salty scent. On the distant horizon, the outline of the Muin Pavilion base was faintly visible.</p>
<p>Chining stood on the deck, looking back towards the southeast. They at a depth of 4,000 m on the seabed, a mystery that transcends time and civilization awaits its answer. And they&#x27;re the only ones who can provide the answer, at least for now. Chapter 157. The mystery of the disc.</p>
<p>As the submersible returned to the Muan Pavilion dock, the setting sun was sinking below the horizon. The orange red light bathed the entire base in a warm hue, but the faces of the people waiting on the dock held little warmth. Linmo, Su Chanchian, sure how and Shin Duo Duo were all there. When Shining, Leewi, and Lao Chin walked onto the dock. All eyes were on them.</p>
<p>No one asked a question, but the question was written in everyone&#x27;s eyes. The meeting room, Lyno said briefly. 10 minutes later, everyone gathered in the conference room next to the command center. Leeway had already transmitted the data recorded by the submersible to the large screen which displayed a highdefinition image of the deep sea disc and the surrounding stationary inheritors in the center. Shinning spent 20 minutes giving a detailed report of the entire contact process.</p>
<p>From the light signal emitted by the inheritors to their response using fortress authority to the discovery of the underwater disc, every detail was included, such as the surrounding bioluminescent creatures and the unusual aquatic chemistry. The conference room was silent except for the low hum of the air conditioning system. Su Chian was the first to break the silence. She pointed to the static inheritors around the disc. You counted them? 23.</p>
<p>24 including the one we came into contact with. Leeway added, &quot;Seven of them have obvious surface damage as if they&#x27;ve been subjected to some kind of impact. The others look intact, but there is no energy reaction.&quot; Dot. Like a parking lot, sure said, or like a fleet on standby. Dot.</p>
<p>Shendo duo stared at the image, her fingers unconsciously tapping the table. Do Soul and the Brotherhood know about this? We probably don&#x27;t know its exact location yet. Chining said, &quot;Our sonar scans show that the underwater canyon where the disc is located has strong natural magnetic field interference, making it difficult for conventional detection equipment to find. The fact that the inheritor can pinpoint its location indicates that it has a special navigation method. Lynn Mo remained silent.</p>
<p>He stared intently at the docking interface in the center of the disc on the screen. His gaze so focused it was as if he wanted to see through the image. What will happen after docking? He asked calmly. I don&#x27;t know. Chining answered truthfully.</p>
<p>But the inheritor s initiative in guiding us to this location indicates that it wants us to know and may even want us to participate. It&#x27;s staying put and waiting for our decision is a form of invitation. Dot. It could also be a trap. Sure.</p>
<p>Hell warrant. Possibly Chinning didn&#x27;t cheat an eye, but if it s a trap, there is no need for it to display those stationary companions. That would be more like proving its origins. Dot. Such an pulled up the latest monitoring data for the bacterial film.</p>
<p>At the same time you discover the disc, a new pattern of pulsating activity appeared in the bacterial film. Look here. Two columns of data waveforms are displayed on screen. The left side shows the bioelect electrical signal of the bacterial film and the right side shows the highfrequency modulated signal emitted by the inheritor. Before a certain point in time, the waveforms of the two are only roughly correlated.</p>
<p>But after that point in time, the waveforms are almost completely synchronized with even the slightest fluctuations being exactly the same. When does this point in time correspond to? Lynn Mo asked. It was 1 col47 p.m. Such shan said that s when the inheritor showed you the disc pattern from that moment on the signal between the mcelium and the inheritor was completely locked. This wasn&#x27;t the just simple communication it was synchronization dot has the bacterial film become an extended sensor for the inheritors libeasa or the other way around such chian said the microbial membrane helps the inheritors perceive their environment.</p>
<p>Danty forget the microbial membrane covers vast areas of the ocean. Its microbial network can detect water temperature, salinity, chemical composition, and even biological activity. If the inheritors can read this data, then its understanding of this sea area far surpasses ours,&quot; Lin Mo added. Silence fell over the meeting room again. This time, the silence was even heavier.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the sky had completely darkened. The lights of the base came on one by one, outlining the buildings against the deep blue night sky. He glanced at it and his expression changed slightly. Breaking news. He stood up and projected a message onto the secondary screen.</p>
<p>Dragon Soles submarines suddenly began to surface half an hour ago and are now on the surface. They launched lifeboats and evacuated several people judging from their attire. They seem to be researchers. At the same time, their fleet has begun to move southeast of the Dead Seeda. What about the Coral Society? The Seeker of Knowledge salvaged some of the wreckage of Explorer 7, but didn&#x27;t leave.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re anchored in place, seemingly planning to spend the night. Chin Duo Duo paused. The Brotherhood&#x27;s radical fleet is anchored 50 nautical miles away without making any further moves, but the Anvil just sent an encrypted message with only two words. How&#x27;s it going? He was asking about the docking. Everyone has sense something unusual.</p>
<p>Sure house said although we dant know exactly what it is. A large-scale energy fluctuation in the deep sea cannot be completely concealed though. Line thought for a few minutes and then made a decision. Contact cars. He said we need to know if that disc is recorded in the fortress database.</p>
<p>If it is, what is its function? What is the docking protocol? And what might happen after docking dot? What if Carl doesn&#x27;t know either? Suchin asked. Then we ll have to make our own judgment. Dot. Lin Mo looked at Shining. Be prepared to set off again.</p>
<p>But this time it is not just about observation. We need to try to establish a deeper communication with the inheritor. If it is indeed waiting for instructions, we need to know what those instructions are and whether we should help it complete the docking dot. The risk is very high. Chining said action carries greater risks.</p>
<p>Lynn Mo replied. There are at least four forces watching this area. Dragon Soul, the Coral Society, the Brotherhood SR radicals and a fourth party we donty know about the owner of that unidentified submersible. If the inheritor falls into the hands of any of these parties, the consequences are unpredictable. Dot.</p>
<p>He paused. Then his voice became more resolute. Instead of passively waiting, we should actively guide them. At least for now, the inheritors have chosen to communicate with us. Once the order was given, all departments began preparations.</p>
<p>Such an Xian and Leewi went to analyze the water and biological samples they brought back, searching for more clues. Sherhow adjusted the defense deployment, preparing for possible conflict. Shin Duo Duo continued to monitor the movements of all parties, especially the intentions of the Dragon Soul Fleet. Chining remained in the conference room, waiting with Linmo for Carl&#x27;s reply. The reply came at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Carl&#x27;s voice came through the encrypted channel, somewhat distorted, but the seriousness in it was palpable. The disc is recorded in the database code named reception platform 7. Design purpose to facilitate the docking, charging, and data exchange of information carriers at the inheritor level. The interface protocol is divided into three levels. basic interface, charging and maintenance, data interface, information upload and download, and task interface, receiving new instructions or uploading task results.</p>
<p>According to the design documents, inheritors typically carry the following types of information: a civilization history database, a technology blueprint library, updated ecological templates, and a civilization status assessment report. Linmo and Chen in exchange of glance, a civilization status assessment report. What might happen after docking depends on the type of information carried by the successor. If it&#x27;s a technological or ecological update, it might be automatically transmitted to the fortress system. If it&#x27;s an assessment report, the system might adjust the priority of subsequent tasks based on the report&#x27;s content.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem. The database shows that reception platform 7 was damaged due to geological activity in the later stages of construction and was marked as abandoned and awaiting repair. Theoretically, it should still be usable. So those static inheritors might be those who failed in their early attempts to connect. Chining asked, &quot;The possibility is very high.</p>
<p>Damage to the platform could cause errors in the docking process, putting the inheritor into a dormant or damaged state. The fact that the one you&#x27;ve contacted is functioning normally indicates that it&#x27;s either exceptionally lucky or exceptionally advanced.&quot; Lynn Mo pondered this information. If we help it connect, is it possible to fix the platform? Uncertain, but since the inheritors guided you to discover the platform, they likely carried a repair protocol or tools. The question is, what conditions are required to repair the platform? Are additional resources needed? Will it activate other systems? None of these are recorded. Another unknown.</p>
<p>Carl, in your opinion, what should we do? Linmo asked directly. A long silence followed. Only a faint electrical hum could be heard in the encrypted channel. My advice, approach with caution and gradually build trust. The final decision rests with you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be prepared here at the fortress. And if a situation gets out of control, I can attempt remote intervention, though the effect will be limited. Additionally, there&#x27;s a theory in the database regarding the synchronization phenomenon between the bofilm and the inheritors. The ecological technology of the designer civilization is based on a distributed sensing network. Different ecological units can share sensor data through standard protocols.</p>
<p>The biofilm may be identified by the system as a qualified sensing node and incorporated into the network. This means that the biofilm is no longer just a microbial community. It has become the eyes and ears of the inheritors and possibly the fortresses. This is both a threat and an opportunity for us. If the biofilm can sense it may also be affected.</p>
<p>After the call ended, Linmo and Chinning sat in the conference room for a long time. On the sea outside the window, moonlight illuminated the waves, giving them a silvery glow. In the distance, the dead sea remained dark. But tonight, a deeper undercurrent seemed to be surging within that darkness. &quot;What do you think?&quot; Lin Mo asked.</p>
<p>Shining rubbed his face, looking somewhat tired. &quot;3 years ago, I had a debate with my mentor Carl.&quot; He said, &quot;When we are faced with ancient technologies that are far beyond our understanding, what is the wisest course of action? Carl&#x27;s believed we should study them cautiously and master them step by step. I think we should learn to let go and acknowledge that some things are not meant for us.&quot; Dot. And now, now I understand that sometimes you dye have the right to let go. Dot.</p>
<p>Chining smiled bitterly. The inheritors have found us. The microbial membrane is evolving and various forces are closing in. Even if we want to hide, there is nowhere to hide. Dot.</p>
<p>He stood up and walked to the window. So, I agree with your decision. Taking the initiative, at least keeping the initiative in our own hands. But we need a plan, a detailed plan that takes all possibilities into account. At 1:00 in the morning, Su Chian returned with her new discovery.</p>
<p>She held two analysis reports in her hands, her face appearing somewhat pale under the light. Water sample analysis results. the concentration of rare earth elements in the water surrounding the inheritor overlaps by 80% with the coolant composition of the fortress&#x27;s energy core. She placed the first report on the table. This is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The inheritor and the fortress used the same technology and may even have been manufactured on the same production line dot. The second report is even more disturbing. We performed gene sequencing on the luminous organisms surrounding the inheritors. Su Chanchian said her voice lowering. They show signs of modification.</p>
<p>Not the large-scale biological recombination of the fortress, but a more refined enhancement of their nervous and sensory systems. In particular, their visual and electromagnetic sensing systems are far more complex than anything that natural evolution can achieve. Who modified them? The genetic markers point to the inheritors. Such Chanchian said it has not a direct modification but rather the release of a certain pheromone that induces the natural evolutionary direction of these organisms. This process may have lasted for decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>Lyno felt a chill. If a successor can guide biological evolution on a scale of hundreds of years, its potential impact on Earth&#x27;s ecology may be far more profound and hidden than today&#x27;s fortresses. Did it guide other creatures as well? he asked. We are expanding the testing scope, Su Chian said, but it will take time. However, we have made another discovery.</p>
<p>She pulled up a set of data charts. Gene sequencing of the bacterial film shows that it integrates gene fragments from at least 17 different marine microorganisms, three of which are ancient species that should have gone extinct. These integrations did not happen randomly. There are clear signs of design. The designer, the timeline doesn&#x27;t team match up.</p>
<p>Sue Chanchian shook her head. The designer&#x27;s activities took place thousands of years ago, but these gene integrations have occurred within the last 300 years. It is more like the inheritors were continuously collecting biological samples from different planets during their long voyages and then conducting synthesis experiments. here. A messenger from a civilization that had been traveling through the universe for an unknown period of time, collecting biological data along the way, finally arrived on Earth to begin its experiments.</p>
<p>And this experimental site is right outside their door. WLL set off tomorrow morning. Do Lin Mo made the final decision. Chianing, Leewi, and Sue Chan, the three of you will come together. Old Chim will drive.</p>
<p>Mission objective. Establish stable communication with the inheritor and understand its full intentions. If possible, inquire about the risks and benefits of docking. However, you must not assist it in docking without my approval. Dot.</p>
<p>What if it insists on docking? Suchin asked. Then tell it that we need more information to make a decision. Linmo said, &quot;If it really has intelligence, it should be able to understand. If it can&#x27;t understand, then we have to reassess its danger.&quot; Dot. At 3:00 a.m., all preparations were completed.</p>
<p>Explorer 2 was fully charged again, replenished with supplies, and equipped with additional communication and protective equipment. Departure was scheduled for 6:00 a.m. before any further action from the various factions. When Lynn Mo saw chining off at the dock, he said something special to her. Remember, we are not exploring ruins.</p>
<p>We are engaging in dialogue with another civilization. Maintain respect, but also remain vigilant. The sea is darkest before dawn, but in the darkness, a glimmer of light already awaits in the depths. Chapter 158, the light speaker. At 6:17 a.m., Explorer 2 dived again.</p>
<p>The seawater gradually changed from dark green to deep blue, finally sinking into pure darkness. Only the submersible lights cut through the deep sea, illuminating a small patch of water ahead. This time, there was another person in the cabin. Sue Chanchan sat in the observation seat next to Lee Wei with a real-time data stream from the bofilm monitoring device in front of her. The bofilm activity is steadily increasing that she stared at the screen.</p>
<p>Since we began our descent, the pulse frequency has increased by 40%. It has monitoring our movements dot to keep an eye on or to monitor. Old Chun asked from the driver&#x27;s seat. It has still unclear. Such Chian said honestly, but one thing is certain.</p>
<p>The signal synchronization between the bacterial membrane and the inheritor has not been interrupted. They&#x27;re like two parts of a system sharing information. Dot at a depth of 800 m. The inheritor appeared on the sonar screen. It remained suspended 300 m above the disc, its surface glowing with a steady frequency like a heartbeat in the deep sea.</p>
<p>Slow down and stop at a distance of 500 meters. Chining said the submersibles slowly came to a stop and hovered in the water. This distance was safe enough and also made it easy to observe. The inheritors seemed to sense their arrival. The frequency of the lights flickering changed from a simple regular flashing to a more complex sequence.</p>
<p>Long short long short long short short long short long. This is random flickering. Lee Wayne noted the signal. It has a clear structure, but I don&#x27;t understand this coding system. Try responding with yesterday&#x27;s verification code, Chining suggested.</p>
<p>Leeway operated the control panel and sent a string of geometric symbol codes again using sonar. This time, the successor responded quickly. Its surface lights dimmed for 3 seconds. Then, when they returned, the light was highly focused, forming a clear beam in the deep sea. The beam wasn&#x27;t directed at the submersible, but downwards precisely aimed at the docking port in the center of the disc.</p>
<p>The beam of light lingered at the interface for about 10 seconds, then moved upwards, sweeping across the stationary inheritors before finally stopping on an individual with a damaged surface. The beam moved back and forth across that individual surface as if demonstrating something. What is it telling us? Perhaps it&#x27;s explaining the state of those stationary individuals, Chinny and Guest. Those that are damaged might be the result of a docking failure. The beam of light shut off.</p>
<p>The inheritor resumed its uniform glow, but this time the light patterns on its surface began to flow, forming dynamic patterns. First, three intersecting rings, then arrows pointing to the disc, followed by a simple diagram. A spindle-shaped object slowly descending and docking with the disc. The diagram is played three times. It&#x27;s demonstrating the docking process.</p>
<p>Leeway understood. But why does it keep emphasizing this? Because it needs to complete the docking. Suchian suddenly said that&#x27;s its core task. Just like migratory birds must migrate and seeds must germinate. Docking is the reason for its existence.</p>
<p>The inheritor seemed to have heard those words. Of course not. But its subsequent actions certainly seemed like a response. The light focused again, this time projecting a holographic image into the deep sea. The image was blurry.</p>
<p>The pixels were coarse, but it was recognizable as a schematic diagram of a galaxy. One star, seven planets, with the third one highlighted. The images shifted, revealing the surface of the planet, magnificent cities, bizarre architecture, and creatures. The creatures were indescribable, like a combination of light and geometry without a fixed form, more like condensations of energy. The designers are civilized, Chining whispered.</p>
<p>The images continued to shift. Anomalies began to appear on the planet&#x27;s surface. First, a dramatic climate change, then intensified geological activity, and finally a spreading gray substance like mold covering the land. Cities dimmed and collapsed one after another. The luminous creatures struggled, their numbers dwindling dramatically.</p>
<p>The final scene, several fortress-like structures rise from the planet&#x27;s surface and soar into the stars. One heads toward the moon of a third planet, while another journeys into even more distant space. Meanwhile, more luminous beings converge, forming streams of light that flow into these structures. The video ends. The inheritor&#x27;s light dimmed as if he had exhausted his energy or fallen into some kind of emotional state.</p>
<p>Silence rained inside the submersible. The four men stared at the location of the vanished image, speechless for a long time. That was their doomsday. That Sue Chanchian finally spoke, her voice very soft. Could the gray substance be some kind of runaway biotechnology or a product of environmental collapse? It asks more like a combination of both.</p>
<p>dot leeway analyzed the last frame of the image. Those gray substances have a clear growth pattern like living organisms, but they can also spread on non-living surfaces. They may be a fusion of some kind of nanomechanical and organic matter. The fortress was their arc of escape. Chinyang said, &quot;And the inheritors might be messengers or seeds carrying the flames of their civilization to find a new home.</p>
<p>But why did it come to Earth?&quot; Old Chun asked the crucial question. No one can answer that. The light of the Inheritor shone brightly once more. This time it projected a new image, a simple star maping three locations. The first was the previous galaxy.</p>
<p>The second was an unknown star region. And the third was the solar system with Earth specifically marked. Following the star chart is a series of data, timestamps, flight path, and energy consumption curve. The last line shows 7.3% remaining energy. It s running out of energy.</p>
<p>Leeway understood the data. After a long journey from its home planet, it s about to run out of energy. So, it has to dock. Otherwise, it will be like those static individuals forever dormant here. D.</p>
<p>So, this isn&#x27;t a choice. It&#x27;s a survival need. The successor demonstrated the docking diagram again, but this time next to the diagram, another set of data was displayed. The minimum energy required for docking 12%. And it currently only had 7.3%.</p>
<p>Insufficient energy to complete docking. Dot. Shining understood. It needs external energy support. It s requesting our help.</p>
<p>How can we help? Suchinian asked. Give it the power from the deep sea submersible. That amount of energy isn&#x27;t even 10,000th of what it needs. The inheritor seemed to have anticipated this question. It projected a third set of images.</p>
<p>a structural diagram of the fortress with the energy core area highlighted. Then came a transmission diagram, the energy transmission path from the fortress to the deep sea disc. It wants to draw energy from the fortress, Leewwayi said. But the fortress is currently under cars control and the energy system is in low power mode. To initiate high power long-d distanceance transmission, it may be necessary to adjust system settings and even take risks.</p>
<p>Risks include energy transmission may be detected by other forces. It may trigger the fortress&#x27;s defense mechanisms and it may affect the fortress&#x27;s own operational stability. We need to talk to Carl. Chennying said just then the monitor sounded an alarm. Suchians expression changed.</p>
<p>The bacterial film is showing abnormal activity. It&#x27;s moving on the screen. The red area representing the coverage of the bacterial film began to expand rapidly. Originally confined to the Dead Sea region, the film was now spreading along the seabed towards the deep sea disc, the structure of the moving front of the film underwent significant changes, forming tentacle-like extensions that crawled quickly along the seabed. It has been summoned.</p>
<p>Dot. Sue Chanchian stared at the data. The inheritor sent out some kind of signal, and the bacterial membrane is responding. These extensions may be going to repair the disc. Sure enough, the light on the inheritor&#x27;s surface changed to a rapid flashing pattern, three times the frequency of before.</p>
<p>With this signal, the movement speed of the bacterial membrane extension increased again. It can&#x27;t wait any longer, Chinnying judged. With insufficient energy and a docking urgent, it has begun to mobilize all available resources. The bacterial membrane has now become its engineering team. Dot.</p>
<p>But can a bacterial film repair high-tech equipment from thousands of years ago? Le bundat complete repairenti necessarily required the such chian pulled up the bacterial membrane as composition analysis. The bacterial membrane can secrete various organic acids and enzymes which can decompose or synthesize specific materials. If the disc only has surface damage or clogged interfaces, the bacterial membrane might indeed be able to clean and repair it. But if the core circuitry or energy system is damaged, she didn&#x27;t finish her sentence, but her meaning was clear. The repair of the bacterial film may be rough and may even cause secondary damage.</p>
<p>The inheritor clearly didn&#x27;t see it that way. It continued to send urgent signals. The vegetative membrane had reached the edge of the disc and was beginning to climb along its surface. Under the submersible lights, the grayish white membrane could be seen covering the engravings on the disc surface like moss covering an ancient stone tablet. We have to make a decision.</p>
<p>Dot. Shining looked at the communicator. Lynmo Uve heard the situation. The inheritor needs energy to complete the docking and now it s starting to repair the platform itself. Should we assist? If we do, it might require using the fortresses s energy.</p>
<p>If we don assist, it might use a more aggressive method to obtain energy. Dot. There was a moment of silence on the communicator. Then Lynn Mo&#x27;s voice came through calm and clear, asking three questions. First, what will it do after docking? Second, how long will docking take? Third, are we allowed to monitor and intervene during the docking process? The problem was converted into an optical signal and sent.</p>
<p>The inheritor&#x27;s response was direct. It projected three short sequences of images. The first sequence. After docking was completed, a pillar of light rose from the center of the disc, and a large amount of data stream appeared within it. The data stream flowed in three directions.</p>
<p>A portion went to the inheritor, a portion went to the disc storage, and a small portion went to the fortress. The second sequence, the docking process lasts approximately 72 hours. During this time, the successor enters a low power state, primarily performing data verification and system selfch checks. The third sequence, a transparent energy barrier appears around the disk labeled isolation protection field. Outside the barrier, a permitted observation sign is displayed, but the intervention sign is crossed out.</p>
<p>It only allows us to look, not touch, Leeway concluded. Moreover, there will be data sharing after docking. Sue Chanchian was focused on the first sequence. Some of the data will be given to the fortress. This may be what it calls the civilization status assessment report or a technology update.</p>
<p>Duh. Chining pondered, &quot;If we provide energy, what will we get in return? Just a right to observe.&quot; The inheritor seemed to have anticipated this question. It projected a final image, a diagram of data exchange. On the left was the energy input and on the right was the data output. The output data was categorized into several types.</p>
<p>Historical archives, basic technologies, ecological knowledge and local adaptation suggestions. It s offering a trade. Chining said energy for knowledge and it specifically mentions local adaptation suggestions which could be helpful in addressing our current global environment. What about the risks? Lynn Mo asked over the communicator. This time the inheritor did not answer directly.</p>
<p>It deactivated all images and returned to its basic luminous state. The light flickered slowly as if waiting. It is waiting for a decision based on trust. Inside the submersible, the four men exchanged glances. Old Chin shrugged.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll listen to you, but let me warn you. Once the energy transfer begins, such a large commotion can&#x27;t be kept secret. Other forces will definitely find out. Discovery was inevitable. Chinying said, &quot;The question is whether we want to seize the initiative.&quot; Such Chian looked at the bofilm monitoring device, the data on which was unsettling.</p>
<p>The bofilm repair is progressing very quickly. At this rate, the surface cleaning of the disc can be completed within 12 hours. If there is still no energy supply by then, the inheritors may try other methods such as directly connecting to the seabed geothermal energy source or even more dangerous methods. Time waits for no one. I suggest providing limited assistance.</p>
<p>The shadow finally said, &quot;Let cars draw the bare minimum of energy from the fortress, just enough to initiate the docking procedure. At the same time, we require real-time monitoring of the data stream, especially the portion transmitted to the fortress. If there is any dangerous content, cars can disconnect at any time. Lynn Mo thought for a minute on the other end of the communicator. Agreed.</p>
<p>Contact Cars and prepare for the energy transfer, but tell him that the transfer power should be controlled at 120% of the theoretical minimum and the duration should not exceed 24 hours. If there is no substantial progress in docking after 24 hours, it should be suspended. Dot. The order has been issued. Explorer 2 began retreating to a safe distance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the fortress 200 nautical miles away, the energy core began adjusting its output mode. In the deep sea, the light on the surface of the inheritor became warm. It slowly turned toward the fortress, as if waiting for a response from afar. Below the bacterial film has already covered onethird of the disc. Repairs have begun.</p>
<p>Chapter 159. The pillar of light changes. 7 minutes after the energy transfer began, the deep sea disc underwent its first change. It wasn&#x27;t a violent vibration or sound, but a more subtle, more fundamental change. The geometric patterns on the disc&#x27;s surface covered by the fungal membrane began to glow faintly.</p>
<p>The light was very weak. The grayish white fungal membrane like translucent parchment couldn&#x27;t conceal the gradually awakening veins beneath. Explorer 2 hovered at a safe distance of 500 m. Inside the cabin for people held their breath, staring intently at the monitoring screen. The energy reading is steadily rising dotly way stared at the instrument.</p>
<p>The transmission efficiency is higher than expected. Carl said that only the lowest power output port was used but the actual energy reaching the disc has already reached 85% of the theoretical value dot the loss is minimal dot Sue Chanchian noticed another phenomenon look at the bacterial film it has guiding energy inside those extensions there are luminous vascular structures like a temporary energy transmission network dot on the screen the mcelium covering the disc indeed presented a peculiar site within the grayish mycelial network. Pale gold lines lit up, extending along specific paths and guiding energy from the receiving points to key nodes throughout the disc. The mcelium was not only repairing but also optimizing energy distribution. Its intelligence level is higher than we thought, Chinning said in a low voice.</p>
<p>This is not a simple biological reaction is a purposeful engineered behavior. Old Chun adjusted the submersible attitude, aligning the observation window directly with the center of the disc. There, the rings around the docking interface began to light up one by one. First, the outermost ring pale blue, then the middle ring turning cyan. The innermost ring remained dark as if waiting for some condition to be met.</p>
<p>The inner ring needs higher energy to activate. Leeway analyze the data stream or it needs some kind of verification signal. At this point, the Inheritors began to descend. It moved very slowly, approaching the disc at a speed of almost millimeters/s. The spindle-shaped hull drew an elegant arc in the deep sea.</p>
<p>The light on its surface converging into a soft halo, focusing only on a thin beam of guiding light at the front, precisely pointing to the docking port. It s very careful. Su Chanchian said like it s afraid of waking something dot or perhaps they&#x27;re afraid of triggering something. Hidden shadow added a remote report came through the communicator from Carl&#x27;s the sound somewhat distorted due to deep sea transmission. Energy transmission is stable.</p>
<p>Fortress energy reserves have decreased by 0.3% within safe limits. Data stream feedback detected from the dis status selfch check report currently being decoded. Preliminary assessment. Platform damage assessment. Surface structure integrity is 71%.</p>
<p>Core energy receiving module is damaged. Data interface oxidized bofilm repair is effective but highle functions cannot be restored. Estimated functional recovery rate after docking. 38%. Only 38% of the functionality has been restored.</p>
<p>This means that even if the docking is successful, the disc platform may only be able to function with minimal effort. Have we informed them of the result? Lynn Emmo asked from the command center. Transmitted via optical signal. The successor response accepted. It appears to require only the bare minimum of functional restoration completing data upload and recharging.</p>
<p>Data upload. This word made everyone&#x27;s heart tighten. What data are you uploading and to whom are you uploading it? The inheritor continued to descend. When they were 50 m from the disc, a sudden change occurred. At the edge of the disc, a damaged inheritor that had been stationary suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a continuous radiance, but rather intermittent spasmotic flashes. A dark red light emanated from the cracks on the surface of the spindle like the last heartbeat of a dying creature. Its hull began to tremble slightly, shaking the bacterial membrane attached to it. Energy leakage. Leeway retrieved the data.</p>
<p>No, it&#x27;s trying to start up. Some of the energy transmitted by the disc has escaped and been absorbed by it. Can be cut off? The shadow asked. Attempts to adjust the transmission path have failed. The energy field has already established an inherent channel.</p>
<p>Forcibly cutting it off may cause a backlash, damaging the fortress&#x27;s output port. asterisk asterisk. Carl&#x27;s voice carried an unusual tension. The flickering of the damaged inheritor grew increasingly rapid. Within the dark red light, something could be vaguely seen writhing inside.</p>
<p>Not a mechanical structure, but more like some kind of biological matter, grayish white and translucent. The bacterial membrane, the bacterial membrane has penetrated inside. It doesn&#x27;t just cover the surface. It has invaded the interior. Sure enough, when the surveillance footage was magnified, it was clearly visible that the hy of the mcelium penetrated deep into the inheritor from the cracks.</p>
<p>spreading through the gaps in the luminous components. Those hy were absorbing the dissipated energy and multiplying at an astonishing rate. It using this damaged organism as a petri dished Sue Chansians voice tightened. It absorbs energy reproduces rapidly and then who knows what it will become. Dot.</p>
<p>The tremors of the damaged inheritor intensified. Suddenly, a larger crack appeared at its front end. not a mechanical opening, but more like a tear in the biomass. From the crack, a mass of grayish white substance surged out a highly concentrated clump of bacterial film. But with a denser structure and a pulsating sheen on its surface after separating from its inheritor, the mass of matter began to slowly drift in the deep sea.</p>
<p>It had no fixed shape, resembling a conscious mass of slime, moving towards the disc. It asked recycling materials. Chining understood. The damaged object is useless, but the bacterial membrane inside still has value. It has going to recycle these reinforced bacterial membranes to repair the disc dot.</p>
<p>Just as he expected, the clump of bacterial film mucus quickly merged into the bacterial film network on the surface after reaching the edge of the disc. At the moment of fusion, the brightness of the bacterial film in the surrounding area increased significantly and the repair speed accelerated by at least three times. It&#x27;s learning and optimizing. Sue Shian recorded the data and it&#x27;s learning very quickly. Every time the enhanced bacterial membrane is recycled, the overall network efficiency improves significantly.</p>
<p>At this rate, she didn&#x27;t finish her sentence, but Chinny understood what she meant. At this rate, the bacterial membrane might evolve to a level that they couldn&#x27;t possibly comprehend before the docking was completed. The inheritor seemed unconcerned. It had descended to a position 20 m from the disc, its speed slowing further. The guiding light at the front was thinner and brighter, like a surgical laser scalpel.</p>
<p>At the center of the disc, the light from the innermost ring finally shown, but it wasn&#x27;t the expected gold or white. Instead, it was a deep purple. The moment the purple light appeared, the entire disc vibrated. Not a physical vibration, but more like a violent fluctuation of the energy field. The monitoring instrument also triggered an alarm.</p>
<p>Energy readings have skyrocketed. Leeway&#x27;s voice rose 200% above the safety threshold. Carl&#x27;s has the transmission power been increased. The fortress&#x27;s output is stable. The disc itself is drawing energy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s activating some hidden system. asterisk asterisk. Purple light radiated outwards from the center of the disc, spreading rapidly along the engravings. Wherever the purple light touched the surface, the bacterial membrane contracted and detached as if scalded. However, the detached membrane did not die.</p>
<p>It clumped together and floated in the surrounding seawater like a school of startled fish. The ultraviolet light is repelling the bacterial film. Su Chanchian stared at the screen. No, it s not repelling. It s disinfecting.</p>
<p>The ultraviolet light has a bacteriaidal effect. It s cleaning the contamination on the surface of the disc. Dot. The bacterial membrane seemed to sense a threat. The entire network&#x27;s activity pattern abruptly changed, shifting from orderly repair to a defensive state.</p>
<p>The extensions ceased advancing, and the gold lines on their surface dimmed, replaced by a dark red reactive pulsation. The inheritor stopped 10 m away from the disc. The light on its surface began to flicker rapidly, so fast that it almost became a continuous flash. At the same time, it projected a brief image towards the submersible. A warning sign see a triangle with an exclamation mark inside.</p>
<p>Below is a line of incomprehensible symbols, but next to the symbols is a diagram. Purple light spreads covering the entire disc and then 12 spike structures rise from the edge of the disc with energy gathering at the top of the structures. A defensive weapon system. The shadowy figure reacted immediately. The disc isn&#x27;t just a docking platform.</p>
<p>It also has self-defense capabilities. The purple light is part of the activation program. Decoding disc data stream for confirmation. Hidden protocol. Clean protocol function removes all unauthorized biomass from the platform.</p>
<p>Secondary protocol defense protocol activation condition platform core functions restored to more than 30%. Carl&#x27;s voice was tinged with frustration. The functionality we restored for it was just enough to trigger the defense protocol. Can we stop it? Lynn Mo asked. Higher privileges are required or authorization from the inheritor themselves is also required.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the inheritor. It remained suspended there, the frequency of its flashing light revealing a sense of hesitation. It seems it didn&#x27;t anticipate this situation either. The purple light had already covered half of the disc. The bacterial network began to retreat in an organized manner, not to escape, but to regroup in the areas around the edge of the disc not covered by the purple light.</p>
<p>These clumps merged together, forming thicker tentacle-like structures, the tips of which began to secrete a dark green mucus. When a mucus came into contact with the edge of the violet light, it hissed like cold water dripping into hot oil. The expansion rate of the violet light slowed down significantly. The bacterial film is fighting back. Sue Chanchian said incredulously, &quot;It is secretting acidic substances to neutralize the violet light.</p>
<p>This requires real-time analysis of the spectral composition and adjustment of the chemical ratio of the secretions. This is not just intelligence. It has close to the ability to creatively solve problems. The struggle between the bacterial membrane and the disc reached a stalemate. The purple light could no longer expand and the bacterial membrane could not regain its lost territory.</p>
<p>Between the two, the inheritor floated silently like a referee or perhaps the root of the conflict. Time passed second by second. Energy transfer continues and the disc&#x27;s functional recovery rate slowly climbs 39% 40%. When it reaches 41%, the first spike structure on the edge of the disc fully rises. It was a cone-shaped object about 3 m long with a smooth mirror-like surface and a spherical energy focusing device at the top.</p>
<p>Pale blue light spots began to gather inside the device, rotating and accelerating, their brightness continuously increasing. Defensive weapon charging. Leeway read out the data. It is expected to reach the launch threshold in 45 seconds. The target appears to be the area with the densest bacterial film accumulation.</p>
<p>But the bacterial film is currently in physical contact with the disc. Such an said attacking the bacterial film could damage the disc itself. Dot. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t teare. The shadowy figure stared at the spike.</p>
<p>Maybe the clean protocol takes precedence over platform integrity. The successor finally made a move. Instead of rising or falling, it began to rotate slowly around its own central axis. It spun like a top. As the rotation accelerated, the light on its surface was stretched into a spiral band of light, drawing dazzling trails in the deep sea.</p>
<p>Symbols began to emerge from the band of light, not the geometric pattern seen before, but a more ancient and abstract hieroglyphic script. The characters flowed and combined, eventually forming a complete message. Carl sent the translation almost simultaneously. It is requesting root access. It wants to temporarily take control of the disk and suspend the defense protocol.</p>
<p>However, it requires verification of a witness. What is a witness? Lynn Mo asked. Uncertain. It may refer to the entities qualified to observe and verify this event. According to the laws or traditions of the designer civilization, certain important decisions require the presence of witnesses to ensure impartiality.</p>
<p>The inheritor&#x27;s rotation speed reached its peak. The text in a band of light began to repeat growing brighter and brighter as if calling out or perhaps pleading. Inside the submersible, the four people looked at each other in bewilderment. It s asking us suian suddenly said, &quot;We are the only intelligent life it has encountered. It s asking us to be witnesses.&quot; How do we do it? Olin asked.</p>
<p>Nobody knows. But the inheritor provided the answer. It projected the final image, a simple gesture, right hand on left shoulder, then palm facing upwards and outstretched. A gesture of respect that signifies witnessing and consent. Should we respond? Leewi asked Chinning.</p>
<p>Chinninging looked at the communicator, waiting for Lin Mo&#x27;s decision. There was a long silence on the other end of the command center. After a long time, the first spike reached 90% charge, and the pale blue light was already dazzling. Eventually, the bacterial film began preparing for a second round of chemical counterattack. And the amount of dark green mucus secreted tripled.</p>
<p>Finally, Lynmo&#x27;s voice came. Go ahead and do it, but only on our personal behalf, not on behalf of human civilization. We witness, but we don&#x27;t endorse. Tell it that. Inside the submersible, Channing took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He stood up and walked to the observation window, though the inheritor couldn&#x27;t see what was happening inside the cabin. Then he made that gesture, his right hand on his left shoulder, palm facing upwards. Lewi and Su Chanchian exchanged a glance and did the same. Chin nodded and raised his hand from the driver&#x27;s seat. The inheritor stopped spinning.</p>
<p>The light momentarily subsided, then exploded outwards. It wasn&#x27;t an aggressive burst, but rather a gentle inclusive wave of light that rippled outwards from its center. The light wave swept across the disc. The purple light went out. The spike structure stopped charging.</p>
<p>The pale blue light dimmed rapidly, and the device slowly retracted. The bacterial film seemed to sense the change, ceasing to secrete acidic mucus, and the tentacle-like structure softened, spread out, and returned to its flat state during repair. At the center of the disc, the docking interface is fully lit up this time in pure gold. The inheritor begins its final descent. This time there was no hesitation, no pause.</p>
<p>It precisely aligned with the interface and slowly sank in. The entire deep sea was silent for a second at the moment of docking. Then the disc burst forth with indescribable light. It wasn&#x27;t a blinding intense light, but a warm dawn-like glow that filled the entire underwater canyon. In this light, the cracks on the still damaged relics began to slowly heal.</p>
<p>not repaired, but rather gently enveloped and smoothed. The bacterial film became transparent in the light and then gradually disappeared, not because it died, but because it merged into the seawater like salt dissolving in water. The light lasted for a full minute. As the light gradually dimmed, a pillar of light rose from the center of a disc. Within the pillar of light, data streams poured forth like a waterfall.</p>
<p>The successor&#x27;s mission is complete. The four people inside the submersible still maintained that gesture of witnessing like four silent sculptures in the gradually darkening deep sea. Chapter 1 60 data decoding. The beam of light lasted for 17 minutes in the deep sea. Explorer 2 hovered at a safe distance.</p>
<p>The only sounds in the cabin, the low hum of instruments and the suppressed breathing of the four crew members. On the monitor screen, a golden stream of data poured out from the center of the disc like a waterfall flowing backward, standing out starkly against the dark seawater. Such an was the first to break the silence. The bacterial film has really disappeared completely. Not only the bacterial film on the surface of the disc, but also the suspended bacterial film clumps in the surrounding seawater and the mcelium that had previously invaded and damaged the inheritor, all gradually became transparent and dissipated after the pillar of light rose.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t death, but more like a kind of return, merging back into the seawater and becoming part of the background. The readings of the active factor on the monitor decreased synchronously, falling from the peak to near the background level. The light beam has a purifying effect, Leeway said, pulling up a spectral analyzer. It is not just about energy transfer. The specific frequency electromagnetic waves it releases can break down the polymer structure of the bacterial bofilm, allowing the microorganisms to return to their independent state.</p>
<p>But this requires extremely precise frequency control. Dot. Chinying remains silent, staring at the small countdown timer on the screen. Carl had previously stated that the docking process would last approximately 72 hours, but the beam phenomenon wasn&#x27;t recorded in detail in the database. This unexpected situation likely meant the docking was more complex or more dangerous than anticipated.</p>
<p>Lynn Mos voice came through the communicator, calm yet slightly tense. Deep sea submersible reporting status. Everything is normal, Old Chin replied. The energy field is stable and there is no direct threat, but there are unusual sonar echoes underwater, not from the disc, but from somewhere further away. Positions southeast about 8 nautical miles away at a depth of 600 m.</p>
<p>The signal is very weak, but its characteristics are similar to those of previously discovered unidentified submersibles. That mysterious fourth party is still nearby. Maintain vigilance, but do not initiate contact. Linmo ordered any new information from Carl&#x27;s side receiving data stream. The transmission rate is astonishing.</p>
<p>The Fortress&#x27;s storage system is already at 37% capacity and is still rising. The data encryption method is complex. Initial decoding will take time. Carl&#x27;s report came through an encrypted channel with the sound of rapid keyboard typing audible in the background. But one thing is certain, this is not a one-way transmission.</p>
<p>The disk is inputting energy into the inheritor. The inheritor is outputting data into the disk and simultaneously some data is flowing towards the fortress through the disc is a three-way exchange. What about the content? Hidden shadow asked. Preliminary analysis has revealed several tags. Civilization chronicle, technology tree map, ecological evolution record, and final message.</p>
<p>Final message has the highest priority and is currently being decoded first. The final message. These words made the air in the cabin even heavier. The beams of light began to change. The brightness gradually decreased, shifting from a dazzling gold to a soft white.</p>
<p>The visualization of the data stream also changed. It was no longer a cascading waterfall, but rather orderly categorized bands of light with different colors representing different types of data. The white beam of light lasted for about 3 minutes, then went out without warning. The deep sea plunged into darkness once more. Only the docking interface at the center of the disc glowed faintly with a blue light, flickering like breath.</p>
<p>The inheritor had completely sunk into the disc and was no longer visible. Phase one complete. That leeway read out the monitoring data. Energy transmission has stopped and data exchange has switched to low power mode. The disc surface temperature has begun to drop and is expected to return to ambient temperature in 2 hours.</p>
<p>Was the docking successful? Suchin asked. According to the fortress&#x27;s confirmation, the core data packet has been transmitted completely. However, the status of the inheritor itself is uncertain. Signals from the disc indicate that it has entered deep hibernation, possibly a necessary recovery period after a long voyage. How long will the hibernation last? Unpredictable.</p>
<p>There are no similar cases recorded in the database. It could take days, years, or even forever. Forever. This word carries an especially heavy weight in the deep sea. Explorer 2 began its slow ascent.</p>
<p>The mission was complete, at least for this stage. They witnessed the docking, ensuring a relatively smooth process, and now needed to return to base to await Carl&#x27;s decoding of the data. Upon ascending to a depth of 200 m, the sonar detected the unidentified submersible signal again. This time it was clearer at a distance of about 5 nautical miles in the same depth. However, it did not approach.</p>
<p>It merely hovered at that distance as if observing or waiting for something. It has spying on us. Oldchin said it could also be a surveillance disc. The shadowy figure stared at the sonar screen. Whatever its purpose, it has best to avoid conflict for now.</p>
<p>continue ascending and maintain normal speed. Dot. It was already evening when the submersible surfaced. The setting sun dyed the sea a golden red and the lights of the Muan Pavilion base in the distance lit up one after another like a string of pearls in the darkening sky. At the dock, Linmo and sure how we&#x27;re waiting for them.</p>
<p>There was no welcoming ceremony, no unnecessary pleasantries. Linmo went straight to the point. What&#x27;s your immediate impression of the data stream you&#x27;ve been seeing? The volume is huge, Leewayi replied. And it is highly structured. It is not like random transmission, but more like a carefully prepared database transfer.</p>
<p>Dot. The dissipation of the bacterial film was a pleasant surprise. Suchinian added. But I&#x27;m not sure if it is permanent. The microbial basis of the film is still in the seawater and it could recombine at any time if conditions are right.</p>
<p>Dot. Chining was the last to disembark. He walked up to Lynmo and said in a low voice, &quot;I think that witness request is more than just going through the motions. It needs someone to confirm that this happened. It needs someone to remember it.&quot; Lynmo nodded without asking further questions.</p>
<p>&quot;Go and rest first. We&#x27;ll meet in the conference room in an hour.&quot; Carl should be able to provide preliminary decoding results then, but the break time was less than an hour. 45 minutes later, an emergency communication brought everyone back to the command center. Instead of a written report, Carl sent an audio message he had decoded a portion of the final message and converted it into a comprehensible speech format. Play.</p>
<p>Carl&#x27;s text message flashed on the screen. Play. Linmo said. The command center fell silent. A slight electrical noise came from the loudspeaker first and then a voice rang out.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not human language but a translated synthesized soundneutral calm and carrying a sense of timelessness. To the person who discovers this message. If you hear this record, it means our civilization has come to an end. This inheritor carrying all our knowledge and memories set out in the final moments before the collapse of our home system. Its mission is to find a suitable new home and pass on our lessons to those who come after.</p>
<p>The sound paused for a few seconds as if giving the listener time to process it. We hope you will avoid the mistakes our people have made. We once believed that technology was sufficient to control nature and that modifying the environment was merely an engineering problem. We reshaped the atmosphere, adjusted the Earth&#x27;s axis, and even redesigned every aspect of the ecosystem. We created a perfect, efficient, standard ecosystem that met all our needs.</p>
<p>Then the system crashed. It&#x27;s not an invasion by external enemies, nor a depletion of resources, but a tiny mutation within the system. A type of microorganism we never anticipated, born in the cracks of the perfect ecosystem. It feeds on the energy flows we design, uses the materials we synthesize as its foundation, and evolves at a speed beyond our comprehension. We call it great devourer.</p>
<p>It meant no harm. It simply existed, but its existence overturned all our designs. When perfection cannot tolerate even the slightest imperfection, collapse becomes inevitable. The data carried by the inheritor contains our rac&#x27;s complete technological archives as well as detailed research records on Ash Devour. Please use the former with caution and pay close attention to the latter.</p>
<p>Ecosystems are not machines. They cannot be fully designed, much less fully controlled. Balance is not static perfection but dynamic tolerance. Allowing variation, allowing errors, allowing imperfections. That is the true foundation for the continuation of life.</p>
<p>May you do even better. Message ended. Recording stopped. A long silence fell over the command center. Suchan was the first to speak, her voice trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Could the gray devour bacterial membrane be? They read not the same thing, but the principles are similar to Lynn Mo continued her words. They are both accidental products born in highly controlled environments. The designer civilization created the standard ecology which resulted in the emergence of gray devourer. We forced the blueprint to be enforced in a fortress which resulted in the emergence of the microbial film. Dot.</p>
<p>So they left behind successors not just to pass on the technology but also to pass on the lessons. Chinying said in a low voice. But Wings of Liberty only saw the technology, not the lessons. Dot. Chin Dodu rushed in at that moment, holding the latest intelligence.</p>
<p>Dragon Souls fleet has begun moving towards the Dead Sea. Not fast, but the direction is clear. The Coral Society&#x27;s seeking knowledge suddenly stopped its salvage operation, and all personnel retreated to the cabin for unknown reasons. The Brotherhood&#x27;s radical factions fleet has disappeared. Disappear? It wasn&#x27;t a departure.</p>
<p>It was a communications blackout. The last signal location was on the southeastern edge of the Dead Sea. And then all communications were cut off. Not even the emergency beacon was triggered. Chandwood&#x27;s face was grim.</p>
<p>The anvil might be doing something extreme. Lynmo walked to the control panel and brought up the C map. Dragon Soul, Coral Society, Brotherhood, all forces were in action, though in different ways, but their target was clearly the deep sea disc that had just completed docking. Carl&#x27;s how has the data decoding progress? He asked. The technology tree map is 15% decoded and the content is astounding.</p>
<p>It includes energy technologies, material science, and even finite space folding theories that we haven&#x27;t yet mastered. However, all the technical documents come with a warning label requires careful evaluation in conjunction with the ecological ethics section. The ecological evolution record is being decoded, primarily containing data on the ecological changes of the designer&#x27;s home planet over hundreds of millions of years, as well as every decision-making step and its consequences during the transformation process. This data is enormous and may take several weeks to fully analyze. The full version of the last message is still being decoded.</p>
<p>Lyno thought for a moment and then made a decision. Make three copies of all decoded data and store them encrypted separately. The technical parts should be sealed off and not used without evaluation. Ecological records should be given priority for research, especially the evolution process and countermeasures of great devouring. How should we deal with dragon soul? Shh asked.</p>
<p>Take the initiative to contact them, Linmo said. Send them a portion of the audio clip of the last message, especially the part about the ecological lessons. also provide real-time monitoring data of the disc area to show that we have the situation under control. If they are wise, they will pause their operations. Dot.</p>
<p>What if they&#x27;re not wise? Then let them see if a system that can instantly purify the bacterial film has any defensive capabilities. Lynmo&#x27;s tone was calm, but the meaning behind his words was clear. The meeting concluded, and everyone went about their respective tasks. Su Chian Xian and Leewi went to study the newly decoded ecological data. Chin Duo Duo went to contact various forces.</p>
<p>Sure, how when to strengthen the base&#x27;s defenses. Chining stay behind and stood in front of the control panel with Linmo. Do you think the successor will wake up again? The shadow asked. I don&#x27;t know. Linmo looked at the real-time monitoring footage of the disc area on the screen, but it has accomplished its core mission to transmit information and lessons.</p>
<p>The rest is up to us. Outside the window, night had completely fallen. On the sea, the lights of Muan Pavilion stood steadfast in the darkness. Deep beneath the sea. The disc lies quietly at the bottom of the canyon.</p>
<p>Its blue light from the interface flashing rhythmically. Inside it, the interstellar traveler slumbers, carrying the last legacy of a civilization and a somber lesson. The data has been handed over. The choice now rests with the recipient. What will they choose? Nobody knows.</p>
<p>But at least for now, they still have a choice.</p>
