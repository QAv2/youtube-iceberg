            <p>Nicola Tesla is often wrapped in stories of secret power and stolen discoveries. But the truth is far more extraordinary. He didn&#x27;t promise magic. He delivered reality. Tesla reshaped the modern world by creating the polyphase alternating current system, allowing electricity to travel across vast distances and light entire cities.</p>
<p>He revealed the rotating magnetic field, giving rise to motors that drive factories, trains, and the beating heart of modern civilization. He reached into the invisible, pioneering radio, wireless communication, highfrequency electricity, and remote control. Decades ahead of his time, Tesla dreamed of wireless power not as fantasy, but as engineering bound by nature&#x27;s laws, limited not by enemies, but by efficiency. His true legacy is not a hidden miracle, but something far greater. The electrical foundation of the world we live in today.</p>
