            <p>on july 9th 1947 there was an incident in north hollywood in hollywood california where people saw a flying saucer crash into this woman&#x27;s yard and burst into flames this is roughly the same time as the roswell incident which is roughly the you know the week of july 7th through the 10th through the 9th of 1947 so a flying saucer crashes in los angeles but what&#x27;s amazing about the case which is now listed under the freedom of information act request on the fbi&#x27;s website this is a real case what you&#x27;re about to see are real photographs they retrieve the flying saucer and it&#x27;s only 30 inches in diameter 30 inches and it&#x27;s made of aluminum and what really got my attention is that when you look at this thing when they cut it in half and they opened it up it&#x27;s got a v-shaped notch and a black hole in the center and if you look at the nasa sts-75 ufo which i estimated two to three miles wide it looks identically the same on on the cameras they can see into the invisible ultraviolet you can see a dark hole in the center you can see these strobing waves coming out of it and you can see this notch cut out of the side of it i mean it&#x27;s really quite remarkable but when we actually look at what was found inside the craft when we read the actual fbi documents it says on the evening of july the 9th 1947 a report was received in the los angeles office that a so-called flying disc had landed in the vicinity of redford and magnolia streets in north hollywood california and described it as approximately 30 inches in diameter it weighed about 22 pounds and in fact we even have the address here where it crashed 11858 magnolia boulevard north hollywood i mean this is a very detailed report but when they took the flying saucer and they cut it in half and you look at these photographs they found that it had a radio tube it mounted in the center so this thing was producing some kind of a magnetic field or some kind of waves and produced anti-gravity and they claimed when the fbi actually researched this a bunch of kids claimed that they were actually it was an experiment kids this is what they&#x27;re claiming in this fbi report i mean 16 years old this kid was 16 years old he said he built this thing and when you really look at it if a 16 year old kid could build a flying saucer in 1947 the same day as the roswell crash where did he get the information was he having telepathic dreams you know in in the last couple of months he decides to build this thing is is is this really not uh you know this is really an extraterrestrial satellite that&#x27;s connected to the main crash uh craft at roswell and when the craft at roswell crashes down in the ground it loses contact with its satellite the little probe and they both crash but why a 16 year old kid why is a 16 year old kid claiming this and if a 16 year old kid did this where is he today where&#x27;s anti-gravity research today and then why aluminum is there something about aluminum that interacting with electromagnetic fields that causes antigravity when we look at boyd bushman the lockheed senior research scientist he actually shows us an experiment and he tells us that both copper and aluminum when they&#x27;re interfaced with certain electromagnetic fields and magnetism produces anti-gravity okay this is good this is my anti-gravity action and i believe if we make these out of aluminum and we follow the rules the droid is saying this car will revolutionize the future when you don&#x27;t these are my anti-gravity thrusters right here which are actually my coils and my fields and my aluminum thrusters the car would be made out of aluminum and you have a bubble kind of glass dome here and you know the driver sits right here and you know you you basically what happens once you can cancel out gravity i mean no more tires down here you know produce friction on the road when you go up a hill you don&#x27;t have to fight gravity going up the hill because you cancelled it out the amount of energy that it would actually take to drive this car once you&#x27;re defying gravity is so small is so small that basically to go forward you would have thrusters in the back of the car here which you can&#x27;t see they&#x27;d be inside the car that would send out magnetic pulses backwards and forwards you go you go zooming off and you could be going hundreds of miles an hour you know flying over the atlantic ocean pacific ocean over the mountain ranges no more highways no more pavement you can land your car anywhere you want to go nope well i yeah because i think one two three four five notice that it floated above the aluminum i mean something mystical inside the aluminum was doing something like happened inside of copper you can&#x27;t run current through aluminum like a wire and traditionally it said it&#x27;s non-conductive but actually you&#x27;re saying it is conductive well something occur actually what&#x27;s happening is that this only works if it&#x27;s ac electricity alternating current alternating current okay notice that this only worked if it was moving in other words i when i was when i&#x27;m working with this it doesn&#x27;t care a thing about each other but when i have motion something happens right when we discover that we reach this this epic and civilization where we get off the ground and we can hover we can be free we can levitate icebergs we can end droughts we can change our architecture we can build pyramids again and levitate giant pieces of stone anti-gravity will revolutionize revolutionize life on this planet it is the answer to sustainability it is what al gore is looking for but al gore doesn&#x27;t know about</p>
