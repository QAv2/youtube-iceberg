            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>The government [music] says they don&#x27;t know the origin of these drones. &gt;&gt; There are still a lot of questions about not just what they are, but also how [music] to respond to them. &gt;&gt; These mysterious objects aren&#x27;t just flying anymore. They are even in the ocean. [music] &gt;&gt; The skies are not classified.</p>
<p>They could be from the oceans. &gt;&gt; We are not alone. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re definitely not alone. If the American public knew how deep this lie went, we would have a crisis on our hands. [music] What is lurking in the depths of the oceans? Explorers have reported anomalous sightings in the water since the 11th century.</p>
<p>I think it is something that is probably reconstructed on the spot. Not surprised that we have found a scratched UFO in the Baltic Sea &gt;&gt; soaring above it. &gt;&gt; I saw something strange, [music] a tic tac incident. &gt;&gt; It was something that couldn&#x27;t be explained. And then they saw it enter the water.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What we saw, we have nothing close to it. I told my buddy I wanted to fly it. &gt;&gt; Members of the US government are blowing the whistle. What you&#x27;re saying is that these objects underwater, these bases underwater, they are nonhuman. You&#x27;re clear about that? &gt;&gt; That would be my belief? Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And are we being sabotaged from exploring it? Are you now saying there is a portal, a tear in the sky? &gt;&gt; Our GPS with that&#x27;s broadcasting what our ADSB data we call it keeps disappearing. &gt;&gt; We keep disappearing. &gt;&gt; We now have more evidence that there is something strange in the Catalina area &gt;&gt; tonight. Is the water something to be feared? s out there the rest of the night with a gun in my hand waiting for something to come creeping out of the water. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve seen some crazy stuff today.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Or does it hold the answers to the great UFO mystery? Do you think we are being lied to by the government of the United States? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I do. In this special edition of Reality Check with Ross Kulart, underwater UFOs. Good day and welcome to a special edition of Reality Check on News Nation.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart, reporting to you from Australia. In fact, near one of my favorite Sydney beaches, Koji, Los Angeles is 7 and a half thousand miles in that direction. I&#x27;ve reported extensively for News Nation on unidentified anomalous phenomena, UAPs, that great existential question, are we alone? In this special hour, we&#x27;re turning our focus from the skies to the depths of the ocean across this planet to another great mystery. Unidentified submerged objects. We&#x27;re taking you underwater with reports for you from an explorer in the Baltic Sea showcasing footage never before seen on television.</p>
<p>Plus, a correspondent in Southern California taking us on camera into depths like never before with a UFO witness sharing mysterious video and never before heard stories about what&#x27;s happening off the coast of the United States. A bombshell new report and videos from a prominent UFO reporting app. And we hear from a retired Navy Rear Admiral and a congressman who believes there is so much more to this planet than we understand. We start by turning to Dennis Asberg, a Swedish deep dive explorer and co-founder of the Ocean X team, renowned for discovering the mysterious Baltic Sea anomaly in 2011. This strange massive underwater formation is perhaps the biggest underwater UFO mystery to date.</p>
<p>Approximately 200 ft wide and resting on the ocean floor. Debunkers say it must be a natural rock formation. But Dennis Asber and his team say what they felt in the area is truly anomalous. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re still out there in the water, hunting now in the Baltic Sea near Russia and Finland for underwater UFOs. On his recent expedition, diving into the depths, finding underwater submarines, shipwrecks, &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t even know what it is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And seeing strange things in the sky. &gt;&gt; Okay. In 2011, Asberg and his Ocean X team discovered something mysterious on the ocean floor. A possible nonhuman structure. &gt;&gt; I mean, the first time we saw it, that was experience because we have never seen anything like that before.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The object now known as the Baltic Sea Anomaly. In the decades since making the discovery, only more questions have been brought than answers. What is it? How old is it? How did it get stranded at the bottom of the ocean? But the hardest question of all to answer, where did it come from? And are there others in our oceans? When we got close to the area, suddenly we had several ships on on the radar or it looked like several ships on the radar, but there were no ships there. &gt;&gt; The strange thing was before we start filming, they were there all the time. They did not get away or disappear or anything.</p>
<p>Asberg and his team have been documenting the strange occurrences and phenomena he and his team encounter when they approach the site of the anomaly. I recently talked to Dennis Asber about the Baltic Sea anomaly. I asked him if he thinks the anomaly is something that can be naturally occurring or if he believes the objects an interstellar mystery. Lots of people have sent messages to me that um this is Millennium Falcon you have found and and yeah it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not but it is something for sure that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m struggling with it. &gt;&gt; Tell me the story of how you discovered this object.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are explorer company treasure hunters you can say also um diving we salvage shipwrecks around the world and cargo from ships wrecks we have scan for like two and a half hour and then this thing popping up on the monitor and I remember we were quite surprised and Peter my colleague is looking at me and say Dennis you know here it&#x27;s a UFO and I just what &gt;&gt; why couldn&#x27;t it be just a big lump of rock. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a very interesting rock. Then nothing my I have seen before, not my colleagues around the world that are explorers as me. Uh you know, I put lots of time to to um see uh if I can get any answer from people that work with the same thing as I do. Uh and nobody have really come up with a good answer.</p>
<p>You noticed other anomalies when you were on site. You had all sorts of weird things happening over the object. Can you talk me through what happened? &gt;&gt; Yeah, lots of things have happened out there. Um the first time we were out there, we noticed that we have problems with our equipment. Um the ROV start did not work properly.</p>
<p>Even his um camera stopped working. Uh the light stopped working. And and I I I when we talked about that I said okay we have the same problem with the ROV with the robot u the compass not working properly and and it feels like this thing or whatever it is don&#x27;t want us to come near it. It&#x27;s not just happening in the depths of the ocean. Hundreds of miles from land, people all over the world are seeing mysterious orbs hovering around large bodies of water.</p>
<p>From large coastal cities to small town beaches, &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s no strobe lights on it, which is weird. That video came from Enigma Labs, which builds itself as the first realtime UAP sightings alert network, allowing users to upload their sightings to the video sharing platform. They recently released a report detailing thousands of strange sightings in waters around the world. They say their goal is to collect evidence in hopes of one day explaining the inexplicable. Congressman Tim Burchett is a vocal skeptic of the official US government position on UFOs that all of these sightings are some kind of gigantic hoax perpetrated by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>This is the law maker who wants to expose the truth. The congressman from Tennessee believes in USOs. He&#x27;s the co-chair of the bipartisan UAP caucus, which he launched to look into allegations UFO whistleblower David Grush made in his interview with me about a legacy crash retrieval program being hidden by the US government. Burchette has helped lead multiple congressional hearings [music] looking into an alleged cover up, working to strengthen whistleblower protections. He&#x27;s very keen on the idea that some or many of these UFOs are coming from underwater.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve been quite outspoken on the subject of UFOs. Why is that? What What prompted your interest? Well, my conversations with with um pilots and they seem to always be over water and then um a chance conversation I had with a former admiral who or I guess you&#x27;re always an admiral if you&#x27;re one um about these five or six deep water areas and it just seemed to make sense. That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re seeing a lot of the um the observations of the UFOs. And then when I&#x27;m told something big as a football field is um moving at 200 m an hour underwater when I know um the best we have is is around 30. It lends itself to a lot of um a lot more questions than answers.</p>
<p>I understand you&#x27;ve spoken to people who are direct witnesses to claims that there are objects that have been detected underwater moving at hundreds of miles an hour. What more detail can you give me on these particular incidents? Well, of course, it&#x27;s done by sonar and that the fact that we have nothing in those capabilities and if you shoot a bullet literally into a a swimming pool, it&#x27;s going to go just a few feet before it just it just stops that you can shoot it through the air and it can go over a mile. And it just shows you the amount of friction and the amount of power that that would have to have. But also it lends itself to why we keep seeing these things overwater and then things that dive into the water. One of the things you&#x27;ve spoken about is the speculation of underwater bases, not human bases, but bases by nonhuman entities.</p>
<p>What can you tell me about what you&#x27;ve been told? Well, that that the concentration would be such that that&#x27;s where they would be and that and that we have not been able to explore any of these areas. If you just look at the numbers of of sightings um out over the ocean, it just seems to lend itself to that. And if you wanted to be undisturbed, where you wouldn&#x27;t go in the middle of New York City or Knoxville, Tennessee, you&#x27;d go, although there&#x27;s some strange things I&#x27;ve seen here, um you would go where you would be least disturbed. And so the most unexplored area and the vastness of our great oceans is is kind of hard to comprehend at some point. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve speculated about five or six bases of nonhuman entities.</p>
<p>Where did you get that number from? from some Navy officials that had in fact um had broached that subject to me. I always remember the last thing this one fell said because you&#x27;ve been in my office, but you come in one door and you can go out the other if you choose and nobody ever does. They just go out the entrance that came up. He chose to go out the the other door so he could kind of get away from all the other. And the last thing he said was he looked at me and said, &quot;Tim, they&#x27;re real.&quot; And I&#x27;ll never forget that.</p>
<p>And I I you know it it led me to believe that he had more information. &gt;&gt; And to be very clear about this, Tim, what you&#x27;re saying is that these objects underwater, these bases underwater, they are nonhuman. You&#x27;re clear about that. &gt;&gt; That would be my belief. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Again, um we don&#x27;t have the capabilities of of traveling there or doing anything else. Clearly something is operating in our oceans very close to the continental United States and as you&#x27;ve speculated it&#x27;s it&#x27;s perhaps using it for some kind of surveillance &gt;&gt; 100%. That&#x27;s the only reason they would be doing it when they, you know, they the numbers go up and then they drop off to almost nothing and then they you have these clusters that occur and that would lead you obviously to believe that that something is observing us or we&#x27;re observing some and we&#x27;re observing them. But, you know, I I guess it still just bothers me that our government won&#x27;t come forward with it because, you know, and I&#x27;ve and the guys on the intelligence committee, um I think I I think and gals, I think you have a few in there that just want to um dissuade us from finding out what the real truth is. &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s go to basics.</p>
<p>Tim, do you think we are being lied to by the government of the United States about the nature of these threats from the ocean? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I do. I think we&#x27;re being lied to about a lot of things with our I don&#x27;t I am the go part of the government and I don&#x27;t trust it. I don&#x27;t trust what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself, why are we being told to keep quiet? Why why the secrecy? Um, and it lends itself to Washington in itself. It&#x27;s about power. It&#x27;s about control. It&#x27;s about secrecy and therein lies some of the power and control over all of us and I suspect all governments across the globe are the same way. &gt;&gt; What do you think is President Trump&#x27;s position on this? Do you think he&#x27;s still amanable or open or receptive to the idea of being more open about UAPs as he promised during his uh campaign for the second administration? &gt;&gt; I think he is.</p>
<p>I still think he is. I&#x27;ve put a lot of faith and trust in in mine and his relationship. I don&#x27;t bother him about stuff all the time. Um I&#x27;ve asked for a a 15minute meeting with him and I would like to discuss. There&#x27;s two or three things I want to bring up to him that [clears throat] I think would would go a long way and one of those is this issue.</p>
<p>Still to come on this special edition of Reality Check, we head to Southern California with special instructions to map deep caverns off the coast of Los Angeles and why this former Trump administration official says California could be home to a secret underwater UFO [music] highway. Welcome back to this special edition of Reality Check. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart. Our correspondent, Ben Hansen, is a UFO hunter in his own right. We sent him off the coast of Southern California with a mission to interview witnesses and use high techch equipment to take us under ocean waters.</p>
<p>Now, we have Rear Admiral Timothy Galidet. Now, he&#x27;s uh been a member of our team for quite some time because of his expertise in so many things. I mean, uh I News Nation is not a stranger to the Rear Admiral here. Um he was the the admin of Noah. He&#x27;s uh has a doctor in oceanography and for these reasons, uh we&#x27;d like him to weigh in on what we&#x27;re about to do here.</p>
<p>So, um Tim, thanks so much for joining us. Um, we&#x27;re here actually oh, a couple miles offshore of Roondo Beach and the information that you sent me about the Roondo Canyon. I I&#x27;d like to ask you a couple questions um about that. &gt;&gt; Well, so I I did some research here and a fairly recent paper on the sedimentary processes uh in this region was published in about 10 years ago here in marine geology. And this is a really interesting paper because these authors used all the modern instruments that that uh are at our disposal.</p>
<p>So we&#x27;re talking what they call multi-beam bethimemetry or multi-beam sonar and also uh autonomous underwater vehicles that have sides scan sonar on them. So they&#x27;ve they have some highly resolved data sets that are worth digging into. So first off, here&#x27;s the big overview of the area we&#x27;re looking into. You have Santa Monica Bay and then it&#x27;s got yet one canyon, Santa Monica Canyon and then the Roondo Canyon and then another view straight on is here. And so yeah, there&#x27;s wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If I were a USO and I wanted to hide somewhere, this is a great place to do it. And you see the steep &gt;&gt; structures here on the these canyon walls. Now granted, there is one thing. These are very active areas. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re often these these turbidity flows or or landslides underwater.</p>
<p>So uh a lot of activity to conceal any movement uh by any craft. So this would be the place to be. &gt;&gt; And Admiral, doesn&#x27;t this connect the end of this uh Roondo Canyon connects to the wider Catalina channel? Is that correct? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Let&#x27;s go back a little bit. And this is really interesting.</p>
<p>So, first off, this red circle is is the reason region I recommended you go dive on. And you can see it. It&#x27;s just pretty much goes right to the offshore region, the Santa Monica Basin and Catalina Channel where I showed you earlier. Uh, this is the area where a lot of UAPs have been seen by Navy ships and others. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, it&#x27;s basically a it&#x27;s kind of like a mono rail route right into the region UAPs have been cited.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I think it would make for an ideal place of concealment coming from offshore and going into this canyon. And so I know Navy pilots well and their and their attitudes. And he he joked, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what it is, but I sure would like to fly it.&quot; We have Ocean Botics with us. Um they&#x27;ve been very gracious to lend us their latest and greatest. We will let you know if we find anything.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been told we even have sonar and a grabber arm on the bottom. Now, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to grab anything at the bottom, but who knows? So, we&#x27;re about 5 miles offshore of Rondo Beach, and we&#x27;re following the GPS coordinates that uh Admiral Galardet gave us. We&#x27;re hoping to put in here at about maybe 900 ft and start drifting so that we can get somewhere uh your tether goes to about a th00and. We need a couple hundred feet though to maneuver in. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s correct.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And it looks like it has some pinchers on there. &gt;&gt; It does. is we have a mechanical grabber. So if we see something of interest and we want to bring it up to the surface, we can to inspect it. &gt;&gt; Can it grab a 20 or 30 foot saucer disc and bring it up? &gt;&gt; Depending on the weight in water, yes, it can.</p>
<p>[laughter] &gt;&gt; I think the main goal here is to see from our perspective how far and fast this canyon drops off and what it looks like. All we have are are maps from the top side. &gt;&gt; All right, on three. &gt;&gt; One, two, three. You are free little ROV.</p>
<p>Go forth and find us UFOs. &gt;&gt; Our field of view right now, I&#x27;d say is probably 20 ft there. And then on the sonar, we have it set to 80 100 ft in front of us. &gt;&gt; 100 ft. But can the lights let us see about what 20 ft? &gt;&gt; About 20 ft of visibility right now.</p>
<p>Right now we are 8 ft from the surface. We&#x27;re all the way down now. Look at all those fish. Wa. That is awesome.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a whole school right there. 5 ft from the bottom. &gt;&gt; Wa. Everywhere. They&#x27;re coming to the light probably.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think so. I&#x27;m in I&#x27;m in it. &gt;&gt; Look at that. Everything I&#x27;m seeing around is very silty. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um viz is really quite bad until you get right down to it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we&#x27;re we&#x27;re so deep that there&#x27;s no light from the sun anymore. So, as you&#x27;re going along there, is your is it going deeper? What are we&#x27;re heading back towards into the canyon from the shallow end? &gt;&gt; It is getting deeper. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. And then you just hit bottom and it created a cloud of dust. &gt;&gt; I can see why the admiral says, you know, like inside the canyon itself, this has experienced probably a lot of like landslides. I could see that um over thousands of years and and their erosion has just created like a silty bottom. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s perching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. Which also causes it to to be really low viz, I imagine. Right. When I think canyon, I&#x27;m thinking like rock walls, which probably there there are those as well, but the actual inside of a canyon looks very silty to me. &gt;&gt; A lot of sand and silt.</p>
<p>Yeah. Which which further adds to the theory that something could hide here quite easily. It&#x27;s not just the depth of it. It&#x27;s the fact that our lights, as powerful as they are, we&#x27;re only seeing about, you know, 20 ft ahead of us, if that. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s natural camouflage, you know. &gt;&gt; Oh, somewhere to grab. Yeah. I&#x27;ll pull it. &gt;&gt; There you go.</p>
<p>All right, that&#x27;s it. &gt;&gt; We launched it and retrieved it. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a good sign. So, this is a great example of what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish today. You can see on the side profile of the sonar here.</p>
<p>This indicates where we&#x27;ve been. And this was about uh 250 ft. That was the uh the level of the kind of like um I guess you could say the planes where it dropped off and we put the ROV was right here right at the drop off. You can see now it goes all the way down to 800 ft right here. And then there&#x27;s another little canyon and then this as we&#x27;re progressing back to shore now comes all the way back up to the surface.</p>
<p>So we have this huge canyon that&#x27;s not too far off from the shore and that leads right up literally to the Rodna Beach Pier. Did Ben find a UFO? No. But he exposed how easy it is for them to hide there. Even with worldclass underwater video equipment, it&#x27;s practically impossible to get a true look inside the underwater canyons below the famous military UFO sighting, the Tic Tac. Who knows what else could be lurking below? When anomalies leave the ocean, they head towards the sky, which is where viewers like you and military pilots often spot and [music] report them.</p>
<p>Next up, a UFO witness called Thor with a wild story. [music] And he&#x27;s also got a cute dog. That is his name is my puppy. He goes everywhere with me. &gt;&gt; Has my puppy been on a lot of your journeys and and everything on [music] &gt;&gt; the past eight years? Yeah.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s been there every time with me. Welcome back to this special edition of Reality Check on News Nation. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart. The military videos of possible UAPs known as the tic-tac, go fast, and gimbal have captivated us all for years and gone without acceptable explanation by the Pentagon. And there are countless sightings of strange lights and possible UFOs over the waters of our oceans every week.</p>
<p>Thor Lizen is a boat captain who frequents the waters near Catalina Island. &gt;&gt; These lights started appearing up in the sky. &gt;&gt; Hard to find where the hell. &gt;&gt; Okay, where&#x27; the third one go? &gt;&gt; On the 13th of September 2021, Thor was on the water when he recorded this video showing three orange orbs. This is the same general area where the famous tic-tac video was recorded by the US military.</p>
<p>And above the deep and mysterious ocean caverns that Tim Galedet pointed us to. While I was actually filming these lights, my friend called me on the telephone, asked me if I was okay. I&#x27;m like, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; She said, &quot;Well, I see lights out there and I thought they might have been flares. Like you were shooting flares out.&quot; cuz she knows my past and that I&#x27;ve had like I&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve been stuck on boats stranded out in the ocean before. So, she&#x27;s just reassuring that I wasn&#x27;t stuck on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; She could see them all the way from Catalina. &gt;&gt; You know that Catalina is very rich in UFO history. &gt;&gt; Thor&#x27;s video was first tested for some kind of logical explanation by Discovery Channel investigators. So, the first thing we did was check the Marine Casualty Database to see if anybody had an emergency or they had to shoot off an emergency flare. &gt;&gt; The Marine Casualty Database tracks emergencies on the water.</p>
<p>And that night, nobody was firing flares. Nearby Camp Pendleton also telling this Discovery Channel investigative team there were no nighttime drills. Vandenberg Air Force Base did launch a SpaceX rocket with Starlink satellites that night, 155 miles north and 25 minutes before Thor&#x27;s sighting. But these investigators say that doesn&#x27;t explain this UFO based off the trajectory of the rocket and the timing. &gt;&gt; So, we don&#x27;t know what it is.</p>
<p>I personally think this is one of the most compelling cases that we&#x27;ve seen. &gt;&gt; And Thor tells NewsNation&#x27;s Ben Hansen in a brand new interview that was far from his only sighting. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. They came back. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll talk about the video first.</p>
<p>So, you have this amazing video of these kind of Would you describe them as orang-ish amberish &gt;&gt; spheres? Orbs? Yeah, they look like miniature galaxies. Tell you the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Like when you&#x27;re looking inside of them or what do you mean they look like a &gt;&gt; like if you look at saw a picture of a galaxy there&#x27;s like this spiral spiral like I don&#x27;t know misty looking of stars and or whatnot going on in there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what they look like. &gt;&gt; Your day job you&#x27;re a boat captain correct? &gt;&gt; Yeah I do sport fishing charters here out at Dana Point Harbor. &gt;&gt; Okay. How long have you been um piloting boats? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been taking boats out of this harbor since I was a little kid.</p>
<p>So like there&#x27;s the houses on the cliff right over there. Those were always blocking my view. You know, I grew up in this neighborhood. So this is like my backyard right here. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So many many years of doing this. And that&#x27;s what really interests us with your case because how long would you say the total duration from when you saw these things? You have a couple minutes on that video, but if you were to say from start to stop on one set of those orangish lights, how long were they up in the air? &gt;&gt; Probably I was witnessing them flying close to my boat for about 10 minutes. There was some smaller ones off in the distance. you don&#x27;t see in the video, but uh it start out like as three orbs that were close together like in a triangular pattern and they&#x27;d all kind of be they were changing colors from red, black, orange, uh some weird oddball stuff and they would merge together as one and then they&#x27;d split off. There&#x27;d be two of them, then there&#x27;d be one, then there&#x27;d be three of them.</p>
<p>And at certain points they&#x27;d just disappeared all together and would just reappear. They dropped down close to the water, like right above the water, and started coming towards me &gt;&gt; really &gt;&gt; until they finally just disappeared. And it looked like they disappeared down into ocean at that point. &gt;&gt; And the reason I I fully believe you is because I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people. Uh we we&#x27;ve had other witnesses, very very similar orang-ish lights.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re always trying to figure out could they possibly be flares. Uh that&#x27;s why because of our connections here, Silverado did contact some some friends. And what did we learn then about the actual Navy exercises that night? &gt;&gt; So we were able to establish at least a month prior to your sighting. There was a large scale Navy exercise going off the coast, but it ended a month before your sighting happened. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re pretty confident in saying that this was not military exercises.</p>
<p>uh it was nothing that was um officially done by them. And if you do something unofficially, you you&#x27;re still probably going to use your exercise training area there. There would be no point to alarm, you know, regular citizens or cause safety issues because as a pilot, if someone&#x27;s dropping an air flare in front of me, I am blinded, right? And that is that is not cool. &gt;&gt; So, you also had a pretty incredible event take place. So, we&#x27;re probably right around five, seven miles off of Avalon towards this coast in a little bit south of there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And uh we drove over something and I know the water&#x27;s like probably like 13,400 ft deep or it it drops off really deep out there into the abyss basically. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And somewhere&#x27;s along the line we drove over something. I have no idea what it could have been, but as we drove over it for those few moments, it flashed lights up at us.</p>
<p>Like I&#x27;m talking like it looked like like baseball stadium lights just surrounding the boat just beaming up all around us. &gt;&gt; When you say drove over, was it already lit up and then you went over the top of it or it came up after you were over? &gt;&gt; It wasn&#x27;t until we got directly over whatever it was [snorts] when these lights came and just beamed all around the boat. middle of the night, probably around 12:00. &gt;&gt; So, it lit everything up. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Could you estimate kind of what the radius how how big it was around the boat? &gt;&gt; I would say um quite possibly half the size of a field &gt;&gt; of a football field. &gt;&gt; 50 yards. &gt;&gt; Yeah. About 50 yards, 25 in all direction, and sat there the rest of the night with a gun in my hand waiting for something to come creeping out of the water. I was that scared.</p>
<p>Like I don&#x27;t get scared easy, but that was a it was a moment. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a ridiculous question, but what would you tell people who said, &quot;Oh, well, it&#x27;s probably phosphorus and algae and and the the blooms we get, you know, that sparkle.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, the the phosph fluoresence, I&#x27;ve seen it all my life since I live right here. I mean, you catch like a a little mackerel that&#x27;s like a foot long and it looks like it&#x27;s 10 feet when you&#x27;re catching it at night with the fossil fues and it glows a green color. Like I said, baseball stadium lights that were bright white beaming up from the bottom or where however deep it was down there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I even got some information from an air traffic controller. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Who said they they had jets scrambled somewhere between here and the channel because I believe a pilot had witnessed something under the water. They said it was like the size of a city. All right.</p>
<p>A light the size of a city. And so they went to check it out. So, just know, well, you don&#x27;t need, you already know. You&#x27;re not the first or the last to witness that type of phenomena. What it is, I don&#x27;t know, but we&#x27;re going to look into it further.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They uh recorded something in the sky, like an anomaly. &gt;&gt; They did. Um I was actually there in the sky. They captured something on their IR camera. It was kind of like this dark part of the cloud and these um objects that look like they&#x27;re around it.</p>
<p>Right. the same time, this same device, the cosmic watch, picked up an anomaly. &gt;&gt; This is where they did research and found that that anomaly, they isolated it to somewhere within this um very large area. [music] I&#x27;m Ben Hansen and this is Reality Check with Ross Colart on News Nation. So, we are at Long Beach Airport and we&#x27;re going to be taking off in this plane in just a minute.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to be exploring a couple of areas very unique to Southern California where dozens if not hundreds of witnesses have seen strange objects coming up out of the water. USOS [music] tower frequency 12.5 &gt;&gt; long beach 765 537 aces high for 26 right with India &gt;&gt; traffic is 133 land operations &gt;&gt; 26 right tax kilo thank you 57 all All right, ready. Cool. All right, gauges are alive. Airspace is alive.</p>
<p>Go. All right, so uh Newport Beach is just to the left of us under here. We&#x27;re at 5,500 and we&#x27;re cruising over the top of the uh the airspace of &gt;&gt; So from here about this location over to Catalina is where Dr. Can Zag Zedaski never say his name right? He&#x27;ll hate me for that. Anyways, this is where they did research and found that that anomaly, they isolated it to somewhere within this um very large area all the way out to Catalina.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And so it&#x27;s really hard for us to pinpoint an exact area. So, we&#x27;re going to fly a track kind of back and forward down in this area to see if we have any anomalous sort of a reading show up in the uh the particle detector. We&#x27;re trying to stay out of the airspace of John Wayne Airport.</p>
<p>And um our GPS with that&#x27;s broadcasting what ADSB data we call it keeps disappearing. My plane &gt;&gt; 67 navigation says thank you for &gt;&gt; he keep disappearing. &gt;&gt; So my my icon and my ADSB data keeps disappearing. Now that&#x27;s not totally uncommon but in that same spot as we went down and as we came back &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; um it&#x27;s malfunctioning. If we go back and we see if there&#x27;s any strange anomaly readings with particle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So this this was weird, guys. Uh Ross is going to love this. Um no joke, in this one area around Laguna Beach, it was just in this area as we&#x27;re going back and forth on this track. I lost GPS data. Now, that&#x27;s not too uncommon with device.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#x27;ll go out, but it returns when I leave the area. &gt;&gt; So, Ben, these detectors that you were using, what are they? How do they work? &gt;&gt; I went to uh Dr. Jadagas and I said, &quot;Look, we&#x27;re going to be going up in a plane. Our interviews, everything kind of pointed us to uh the idea that I think we should get up in the air and try to do a survey, but what do you survey with? We&#x27;ve got EMF fields, um, radiation, which which I I really know very little about. So, the expert, Dr.</p>
<p>Jadaga, said, &quot;Well, we&#x27;ve got these particle detectors.&quot; So, he lent them to me, gave me some basic instructions, and uh, I had one of my team members, John, run that. And, uh, I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll let Dr. Jadagus explain when we turned over the data to him uh, what he actually found. Professor, &gt;&gt; what happened was um crazy in my opinion. So, first of all, one of them didn&#x27;t work at all.</p>
<p>That was not anomalous because equipment just doesn&#x27;t work. Equipment fails. It&#x27;s not anomalous. But one was working. But very strange is that when he got close to the area, you know, on our famous pole in the sky, he didn&#x27;t just experience GPS issues.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a separate story. But he al we also found when I looked at the data from the cosmic watch, it seemed to start rising faster than I would have expected naturally from cosmic rays with altitude. And then all of a sudden the device just stopped working. And I&#x27;ve never seen it stop working in this exact failure mode. It just stopped taking data.</p>
<p>And then when he left this roughly rectangular area and when he&#x27;s landing the plane, it resumed normal operation. And despite multiple attempts for me of testing the exact same unit that he shipped back to me, I could not replicate this failure mode where it just stopped taking data. I I cannot explain this right now. &gt;&gt; So, professor, what&#x27;s the takeaway from that? Are you now saying there is a portal, a tear in the sky, some kind of wormhole? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d love to be able to say that, but we don&#x27;t have sufficient evidence of that because we don&#x27;t have um gravitational anomalies, gravitational waves like you would see from something like that. We are very far from being able to confirm something like that.</p>
<p>I would love to be able to confirm something like that, but we are still in the scientific process, which is slow. Science is slow and boring. We are still not there. But where we are is we&#x27;re better off than we were. We now have more evidence that there [clears throat] is something strange in the Catalina area.</p>
<p>Next up, is there a secret underwater base near Catalina Island? [music] One of the leading experts on underwater UFOs is author and investigator Richard Dolan. Richard&#x27;s the author of a series of books on USOS, unidentified submerged objects. He and I talked about the speculation, the possibility that there&#x27;s some kind of secret underwater base off the coast [music] of Catalina Island. Catalina Island is clearly a UAP hotspot. What&#x27;s going on? &gt;&gt; What I can definitely say to you is that there is a an inordinate inordinate number of truly fascinating um UAP and USO cases in that area.</p>
<p>One thing I wonder is is what kind of military if any connection is there. Uh Catalina Island is not far from the area where of course the USS Nimitz had its encounter with the the famous tic-tac UFO. We all know about that. And there are a number of other US Navy um operations going on down there by San Diego and all across the California coastline in fact. So that&#x27;s a factor that uh I often wonder like how does that fit into all of this? And I don&#x27;t know if we have the full answer, but I I can definitely say with confidence that there is a a definite strangeness going on with that area without a doubt.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Is it possible, Richard, that there&#x27;s a base of non-human intelligences that&#x27;s located itself somewhere underwater? &gt;&gt; I definitely think it&#x27;s possible. Yes, Ross, I do. There are a few places on the planet where it seems to me that you&#x27;ve got a real potential for a non-human base, and I do think the Catalina Island or somewhere around that is a real possibility. &gt;&gt; Well, that concludes our special edition of Reality Check on News Nation, investigating UFOs, unidentified submerged objects. It&#x27;s interesting when you consider that 70% of the Earth&#x27;s surface area is covered by our oceans and we know so little about them.</p>
<p>Small wonder then that so much of attention now is being directed towards our oceans as a possible explanation for the UFO UAP mystery. It&#x27;s a very intriguing question. Are there some kind of alien life form living inside our oceans? [music] Maybe the answer lies in the deep. Thank you so much for joining us. I&#x27;m your host, Ross Kulart.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll see you again soon sometime. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]</p>
