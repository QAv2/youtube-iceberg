            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>All right, this is an interesting one. So, Red Panda Koala had posted um something that a Reddit user I posted around two years ago and it was David Grush, as you saw in the thumbnail. David Grush had spoken at this event around two years ago and it was a private event. He didn&#x27;t get paid for it. He went there to speak to a bunch of bigwigs about the things that were happening um that he went through.</p>
<p>He he had some huge details and this Reddit user who was there posted about the stuff that was said that Grush said. So I thought it was interesting to kind of go through and then we can kind of discuss the overall of what it means because we still don&#x27;t really know where Grush is. We still haven&#x27;t seen that oped. We still haven&#x27;t seen a lot of these things. We know that he&#x27;s consulting on that um that movie with Kazinski, but we don&#x27;t know where he is.</p>
<p>And this if it was again around two years ago, it was right at the height of when everybody was talking to him. He was speaking to more people. So, a breakdown a little bit more of what he was discussing I find to be interesting because a couple of details that I had never heard before and again it&#x27;s two it&#x27;s been two years so maybe it&#x27;s been floated out there. But check this out. Check out this post from Red Panda Koala.</p>
<p>So again, Red Panda Koala here. David Grush was speaking privately for wealthy people. According to Reddit, Brush worked for a secret program that figured out how to track UFOs in the atmosphere. The US has recovered a UFO 40T on the outside, 400 feet on the inside. Recovered UFO generates and uses a terowatt.</p>
<p>So let&#x27;s listen to this. This is kind of broken down and then we&#x27;ll uh we&#x27;ll talk about it afterwards. Here it is. &gt;&gt; I actually went to a private 60 person presentation with David Grouch as the speaker. This was mostly all private citizens as in professors, lawyers, business people, a few scientists, retired military, current FBI, and other government agency members.</p>
<p>In the end, we were allowed to ask questions. Some asked him about this and what he said was that he was part of an extremely secret program that had figured out how to track and find UAPs in our atmosphere in near Earth orbit. He said his OPED will include much more details regarding this. It was hosted by a Wall Street big wigs and his lawyer friend. It was sort of a small saloon style tom.</p>
<p>David also did it for free. Even went as far as to fly in to NYC just for this. He had arrived only a few hours beforehand and then left first thing the next day. The idea was to get a group of both skeptics and believers from all these different walks of life for a talk regarding David and the things he had said. Most of the people that left had left as believers or at the very least believed that David was not lying and truly believed everything he said.</p>
<p>He also mentioned a few other things that I haven&#x27;t heard him say before. Like that he was told about a UAP that was in our possession that had a diameter of around 40 ft, but once you went inside, it was the size of a football field. They believed that the object was somehow able to manipulate both space and time. He also said that the object was both using and creating energy that was more than a terowatt when measured, which is an absolutely ridiculous amount of power, something along the ions of 1 trillion watts. He also mentioned that he had recently been informed that a US adversary was considering full disclosure to get out ahead of the US and that he passed this information along to the US government.</p>
<p>He also alluded to the retaliation that WQS had taken against him. It sounded pretty terrifying. And he wasn&#x27;t the only one to be retaliated against. Multiple people involved in not only his investigation, but also his fellow peers in the UAP task force, such as Jay Stratton, were also threatened. He wouldn&#x27;t go too much into since it&#x27;s an open investigation, but these people pretty showed him that they could touch him or his family anytime they wanted.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that the US has taken part in a fair amount of crash retrievalss before 1933. Also that we wouldn&#x27;t be surprised by what the NHI look like such as they look like the typical gray and they aren&#x27;t sure where these being have come from. There is also a chance that they are extradimensional but that it could also just seem this way because of the technology they use rather than them being actual extradimensional beings. Interestingly, he also mentioned how many people know the full scope of the phenomenon to be no more than 50 people, but it wasn&#x27;t clear whether this meant 50 people currently alive or 50 people ever in history. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll tell you, life has been moving at 175 miles hour for me lately.</p>
<p>But one of the ways that I&#x27;m able to chill out, unwind is cornbread hemps CPD gummies. I mean, I really have been able to chill out, relax with these gummies. They&#x27;re formulated to work with your body. Not against it. I&#x27;m not a spring chicken, but I care about maintaining my physical and mental wellness.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get myself uh healthy, and cornbread hemp CBD gummies, they&#x27;re a huge part of my wellness plan. They really make me relax. Cornbread hemp CPD gummies, they&#x27;re made to make you feel better. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s stress, it&#x27;s discomfort, or you just need to chill out, relax. They use the best part of the hemp plant, which is the flour, for the purest and most potent CPD.</p>
<p>All products are third party lab tested and USDA organic to ensure safety and purity. So, right now, DTE listeners can save 30% off of their first order. You got to head on over to cornbreadmp.com/dte. Use the code DTE at checkout. It&#x27;s cornbread hemp.comdte.</p>
<p>Use the code DTE. I promise you, you will thank me. All right. So, that was actually from two years ago. Um, redpandquala wrote inside of that.</p>
<p>So, he there&#x27;s just something he wanted to go over, wanted to discuss, things that that Reddit had posted. So, it was again, it was two years. This is in the height that that&#x27;s the end of 2003. Um, and at that point in time, it shows you how much, we&#x27;ve talked about this recently, how much things have changed in just about 2 years, right? So, if it was 2 years ago and it was after the hearing, it&#x27;s when everybody wanted to talk to Gush and he was doing a private event for people. I like the fact that he didn&#x27;t get paid for it.</p>
<p>Um, he was just there to talk to people about it. I think that was when I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s still I assuming they were talking about Danny Sheen at that time. I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s still running around with Sheen. I don&#x27;t know. But at that time, you look at from what 2023 was to then the farce of the hearing in 2024 to what we got in 2025.</p>
<p>Um, and things have just kind of not been that uh cooperative, if you will, but he was in a very different place. And as he mentioned, I remember him being on Rogan. Um it might have been around the same time as this thing where they were talking and really getting excited about the UAPDA bill that could get passed, but he had grush on Rogan mentioned how Mike Turner could get involved and if he did then there would be a problem and that&#x27;s ultimately what happened and that seems to be this thing seems to be before any of that went down. So so much has gone down since then but it&#x27;s the stuff that he&#x27;s talking about in general which is fascinating, right? like all of it. And I I do believe brush.</p>
<p>I believe brush what he says, the things that he&#x27;s talked about in general. Um, and I do have the question that I really just don&#x27;t know the answer to. and my whether it&#x27;s him, Lacatsky, um Lu Alzando, uh Jay Stratton, why are they able to talk about these things that happened, whether it&#x27;s a 40-foot UFO, all these different things that they can talk about at these private meetings, they can talk about Eric Davis, right? Talk about it at a at these at these place. They talk about it whether it&#x27;s on a podcast or whatever it might be. But when it comes to testifying in Congress, they don&#x27;t do it and they won&#x27;t do it and they and there&#x27;s certain times that and Lozano did testify, right? But then certain things I can&#x27;t tell you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you about a big 40 foot thing that I saw in the water or I saw footage of I saw this, but I can&#x27;t go into specifics on that. I can&#x27;t go into specifics on that. I can tell you this, but he just told me about this. Why can&#x27;t you tell me about that? Grush going into all these details. How come he didn&#x27;t say this stuff that he&#x27;s talking about here? How come he didn&#x27;t talk about that at the hearing? I don&#x27;t know the answer to it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty naive to why or why not he can&#x27;t say the things that he&#x27;s able to say. Um, you know, some people will say, &quot;Well, then one of the reasons that he&#x27;s not doing it is because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s under oath. You can get in more trouble that way if anything&#x27;s proven to be untrue.&quot; Um, because I I don&#x27;t understand the whole well, it&#x27;s classified thing, but I can talk about it here, but I can&#x27;t talk about it there. I just don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t get it. Uh, and the op-ed is the other thing that was mentioned inside of this, which is fascinating, right? And to me, we have been waiting for that thing for a while, and it seems like it&#x27;s being held up.</p>
<p>People don&#x27;t want it to come out. Remember, there are certain parts, I can&#x27;t remember which, it all blends together at this point. What show it was that said that there was there was a particular It might have been Matt Brown. Was it Matt Brown? Matt Brown who said that if you even brought up David Gush&#x27;s name, it was like it was like taboo and you get in trouble for even bringing up his name. So clearly they were trying to shut him down at all costs.</p>
<p>So that oped is is another one. They&#x27;re just going to shut it down at all costs. Um so I don&#x27;t know what it means overall for the future of Gush. What I do know is that he&#x27;s consulted on this movie. Now he was working with Berles.</p>
<p>He was working with Burles. It doesn&#x27;t seem like he&#x27;s working with him anymore. You don&#x27;t hear about them in cahoots anymore. And it seems like he&#x27;s off making this movie. Now, this is the other thing, and I&#x27;ve mentioned this many times over, where we were talking about Age of Disclosure leading into the Spielberg movie, leading into the Kazinski movie, leading into the Travaro movie.</p>
<p>um this movie that he&#x27;s working on. Do they take stories like this? If he&#x27;s out there at private events talking about this type of stuff, well then why couldn&#x27;t he tell Kazinski this is the type of stuff that was recovered. These are the type of things that we saw. These are the type of things that I was told. And Kazinski goes, &quot;Well, damn.</p>
<p>We got to put that in the script.&quot; It reminds me of like the Sopranos. I I don&#x27;t know if people are fans of the Sopranos. There was episodes where Christopher Malttoanti was talking to his writer buddy about some of the things that went down and happened and he&#x27;s this is great stuff and they put it into the script and I think and it was like it was real stuff and you have some of these mobsters are looking going oh my god you putting that what what are you doing? putting that into the script. And that&#x27;s what maybe they&#x27;re going to do this time around where we see this movie, this Kazinski movie comes out to the average Joe, oh that&#x27;s Hollywood being Hollywood, but to somebody in the agency going, &quot;This guy&#x27;s still talking because that [ __ ] went down.&quot; Like the 50 people who worked on it. I mean, you could just from that meeting alone, from that summary of the Reddit user, you could craft a whole movie out of that of all the different things.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. The energy that&#x27;s used inside of the ship, like those types of things. It&#x27;s it it is that same conversation we&#x27;ve been having for the last two and a half years since David Grush went public of if there is a way for other people to prove true the stuff that David Grush was told, the other stuff that has been insinuated. If you get more people out there, this but you need you need more people and you need this type of 2023 energy to be happening today and that&#x27;s not where we&#x27;re at. I was in the chat room for Jeremy Corbell&#x27;s uh weaponized earlier today and the topic of his show is is disclosure dead and you know clearly he and George Knap do not believe that and you know he answered me in in the comments section uh something that I had said and I was because well George Knap had was quoting Carl Nell and Carl Nell said something along the lines of that the last hearing was disappointing because it just seemed like the same beats were being repeated and nothing new was happening.</p>
<p>George Knap did not agree with that. He thought there was some fascinating things that happened. Um, and I said I I happen to agree with Carl Nell. I think that there&#x27;s for the, you know, out for this circle, there&#x27;s really not a lot new, and it didn&#x27;t push it towards the mainstream media, which I know some people still don&#x27;t agree with me with, but it&#x27;s how a lot of people get their news. And when they&#x27;re focused, like if I keep if if every day the news is covering um a cat with a hamburger hat and he just dances all day long and it was a story on every news for a week straight talking about the cat.</p>
<p>Oh, the cat with the hamburger hat is back. Everybody on the street is talking about the stupid cat with the hamburger hat. If a couple of Tik Tok videos are talking about it, the word starts to get spread. There&#x27;s a couple of YouTube videos, the word starts to get spread and there&#x27;s community, but it&#x27;s not as widely spread. So, inside of that thing, I said, you know, I happen to agree with Carl Nil.</p>
<p>I think that there was some good testimony and other things, too, but I don&#x27;t think it moved the needle. And we kind of went back and forth and he said, &quot;Well, I understand where you&#x27;re coming from. I see it a little bit differently.&quot; And the point he made that I didn&#x27;t really consider although probably thought about it but didn&#x27;t really I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t mention it when I often enough car um George Knap and Jeremy Carbell are constantly speaking to people who are getting more confidence now after that stuff to say you know what maybe it&#x27;s time for me now because the more you do it and the more you see more of your peers we might not be getting the information out the way that we maybe we hope for. But to those people who have been sitting on the sidelines just waiting, that gives them that extra boost of confidence to go out and do stuff because look at what Grush did for other people in general. And you even like Matt Brown, my my story today was going to be about Matt Brown.</p>
<p>Um, our good friend Pavell uh was had posted a video and Matt Brown quote tweeted his tweet and Matt Brown said that there&#x27;s some information coming from him. He hopes soon. So, we&#x27;ll have to see. There&#x27;s a lot of information, a lot of things coming. I mean, Hellman, the AI Atlas supposed to be here in like 7 days.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s that going to be? Going to be a whole lot of nothing? We&#x27;ll cover it on the channel and we&#x27;ll see. So, what&#x27;s your thoughts? Like I said, I know this is a um this is around a 2 and 1/2 year or you about 2 year old thing, but I think that it is interesting that this is brought to light now. And it also is relevant to what&#x27;s happening in general and where is Grush overall. So, what do you make of all of it? Put your thoughts in there. Let us know.</p>
<p>We want to hear from you.</p>
