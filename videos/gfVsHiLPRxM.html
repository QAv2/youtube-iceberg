            <p>have you ever dreamt of a world where gravity could be manipulated at will this was the vision of American inventor Thomas towns in brown welcome to the channel we are trying to reach a th000 subscribers please like And subscribe born on March 18th 1905 Brown was a curious mind from the get-go while tinkering in a laboratory his parents had set up for him he made a startling Discovery using a coolage tube a type of X-ray vacuum tube with Asm electrical electrodes Brown noticed that the tube&#x27;s Mass seemed to decrease when power was applied with the Positive electrode facing upward and increase when the electrode faced downward convinced that he had found a way to electrically influence gravity Brown attempted to share his theories with the scientific community at Caltech in 1923 inviting instructors to his home lab he was met with skepticism under deterred he published his findings in the Los Angeles evening Express the following year under the headline claims gravity is a not a pull Brown&#x27;s pursuit of this groundbreaking idea did not stop there he continued his experiments at Dennison University even claiming collaboration with Professor Paul Alfred beeld though no records of such collaboration exist unfazed Brown developed an electrical device he called a gravior or gravitator which he patented in Britain in November 1928 Brown was relentless in his advocacy for the potential of his inventions he presented his gravitator as a means of propulsion to General Motors Executives in 1930 and argued for its use in ship propulsion at the naval research laboratory in 1932 after the second world war he continued to promote his inventions for aircraft and spacecraft propulsion coining the term electrogravitics to describe his theory however despite demonstrating his devices to scientists and military officials across the US England and France subsequent Research into his inventions revealed no evidence of anti-gravity effects instead the OB res erve movement was attributed to Electric wind or ionic Drift from air particles casting doubt on Brown&#x27;s claims regardless Brown&#x27;s Legacy remains a subject of Fascination and debate his tireless dedication to unconventional propulsion Technologies continues to Intrigue researchers and enthusiasts alike sparking imagination and fueling the pursuit of knowledge in the boundless Frontier of science</p>
