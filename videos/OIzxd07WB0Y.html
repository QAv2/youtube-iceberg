            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you might want to triple clench your butt cheeks for this one because apparently they are talking about the aliens disclosure. Yep. Hide your kids, hide your wives. We got to actually talk about it. We also got a lot of the clips going around of UFOs, some new stuff coming out.</p>
<p>So, I want to show you that, too. So, needless to say, you&#x27;re going to get some tonight. All right, but first of all, check this one out. Roll it. &gt;&gt; Analysis at the central bank has urged Governor Bank of England must plan for [music] financial crisis sparked by aliens.</p>
<p>And then again and again. [music] Bank of England warned to prepare for aliens due to imminent US disclosure. &gt;&gt; This is a hot topic right now. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re cautious.</p>
<p>[music] A former &gt;&gt; check this out. &gt;&gt; Securityory of the UK&#x27;s central bank has written to Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England&#x27;s governor, urging him to set out contingencies in case the White House confirms the existence of alien life. It&#x27;s going to. It&#x27;s going to. &gt;&gt; Disclosure will be here soon.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been saying this. I&#x27;ve been ridiculed about the piss taken out of me a long time now. I&#x27;ve tried to just talk about this on my podcast and I&#x27;ve had the piss taken out of me. &gt;&gt; What do you know about aliens? I know a lot. I know a lot.</p>
<p>Paranoid &gt;&gt; comes in useful sometimes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So yeah, I mean looks like that a lot of people kind of went bat crazy at him. So yeah, he&#x27;s having one of those episodes.</p>
<p>But now this is this news is batshit crazy, bro. Honest to God, what a start to a year we have. Honest to God, check this. Shout out to Christina Roll. Who&#x27;s making this claim? Helen Macau spent 10 years at the Bank of England as a senior analyst in financial security.</p>
<p>Her job was to prepare for events that could impact the economy. &gt;&gt; Bank of England must plan for a financial crisis sparked by aliens. &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; What a what a start to a year we&#x27;re getting. Man, that&#x27;s crazy. Now, a lot of people are saying banks need somebody to blame.</p>
<p>So, they&#x27;re like, &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s blame them damn aliens.&quot; Imagine the aliens are watching this and they&#x27;re getting hella mad right now. They&#x27;re like, &quot;Yo, why blame us, bro? We minding our we we&#x27;re just minding our business. Y&#x27;all need to do better uh as a as a banking system.&quot; So, yeah, why us? Imagine they get mad and they actually show up because of it, not because they wanted to show up, but they might show up because they got hella mad by these by by Bank of England. And maybe because of Bank of England, they might show up and Reagan the hell out of us, bro. Hopefully not.</p>
<p>But and she just wrote to Governor Andrew Bailey urging him to prepare for a scenario that really sounds like something that just came out of a movie. In her letter, she states that the US government appears to be halfway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information. &gt;&gt; I mean, that doesn&#x27;t come off as a shocker. America want to be number one in everything. And we know this bro for a long ass time that and we&#x27;ve had so many whistleblowers come forward say that the AMERICAN THE US GOVERNMENT GOT THEM ALIENS UNDER AREA 51.</p>
<p>YOU KNOW THE DELI BASE YOU KNOW THE PHOENIX lights the Roswell CRASH THEY ARE HERE. THE MARTIANS are here. Lock yourselves in the basement. We have been hearing about it for ages. I guess it&#x27;s time.</p>
<p>I mean when I first heard the story I got hyped up. Not going to lie. But hopefully it&#x27;s not going to be a nothing burger. Hopefully it&#x27;s not going to be blue balls. on the existence of a technologically advanced nonhuman intelligence.</p>
<p>She warned that if UAP proves to be of nonhuman origin, humanity may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government with potentially unknown intentions. Her predictions are pretty specific. Extreme price fluctuations in financial markets. A collapse in confidence if people feel uncertain about how to price things. a rush for safe havens like gold and government bonds or possibly a rush to Bitcoin if people lose trust.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s all about money and it always has been about money, right? Power and greed. Obviously, like duh, we know that. We&#x27;ve been known that for a minute now. But this begs the question, I mean, what she&#x27;s saying actually makes sense when you think about it, right? Cuz if let&#x27;s just say hypothetically tomorrow they come out and they give us the disclosure. Yep, aliens are real.</p>
<p>You know, they give us full honest truth. Let&#x27;s just say President Trump comes tomorrow or any president comes out tomorrow and talks about gives us disclosure. Yeah, people going to react. I don&#x27;t know how people going to react. I mean, if you&#x27;re a believer, then you&#x27;re going to be like, &quot;Holy smokes, it ain&#x27;t no dang joke.&quot; Cuz I mean, you&#x27;re going to be excited, but you&#x27;re also going to be a little nervous.</p>
<p>I guess that&#x27;s how everybody&#x27;s going to feel about it, regard irregardless of whether you&#x27;re a believer that we&#x27;re alone or not alone. And the first thing that&#x27;s going to happen is yeah, people not going to have confidence in terms of yeah, people going to pull out their money. And realistically though, regardless if the the disclosure is good or bad, the stock market likely going to go down, right? Economy is probably going to plummet. Uh and then if it turns out that the aliens are good, yeah, market&#x27;s going to recover. Everything&#x27;s going to be fine.</p>
<p>But if it turns out that we got green little men running around shooting everybody with ray guns, oh my god, that&#x27;s uh going to be chaos everywhere for sure. But that&#x27;s like the worst case scenario &gt;&gt; in governmentbacked currencies entirely. But has Bitcoin ever really been trusted? &gt;&gt; However, her worstc case scenario is very very blunt. Within hours of a clear announcement, there will be total financial instability. The reason I believe this is because guys, we&#x27;ve look at World War I, World War II, you know, uh 2008 fin 2008 financial crisis, right? Or housing market cr uh crisis.</p>
<p>Uh [laughter] the COVID 2020, we all saw the markets crash like crazy. But it always recovers. It always recovers. Long-term, it always goes up. But with the aliens situation, it&#x27;s definitely going to crash.</p>
<p>But if it but if it turns out they&#x27;re good and everything is good, yeah, the market&#x27;s going to recover like every other time. But if it turns out that they are actually the the bad guys, yo, [laughter] then uh it&#x27;s going to be a different scenario. So basically panic&#x27;s going to kick in and uh yeah, there is that. And then you know what happens, right? Everybody&#x27;s going to hoard on those toilet paper. Cannot forget the toilet paper though.</p>
<p>Real quick though, I got to take a second to shout out the homie Michael for the $2 super thanks. He says, &quot;Hey Skizzle, mankind is doomed with this AI stuff. Skynet anyone.&quot; So, basically, he saw this video that you&#x27;re seeing the thumbnail of, right? If you haven&#x27;t seen it, definitely check out a crazy one. Crazy video to say the least. Uh, the homie Jean Leon for the $5.</p>
<p>Super thanks. The homie Ben Ireland for the five as well. Thank you guys so much for liking the video, subscribing, super thanks, tips, becoming members, supporting the channel the way you do helps out. Helps the channel out tremendously. 10 10 over and out.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get back to the content here. Boo, check this. banks failing, payment systems collapsing, rioting because people cannot buy food or fuel. And this connects to a white paper she wrote in May of 2024 for the Soul Foundation, a policy group focused on preparing for a postUAP World. In that report, she called on the Bank of England to raise UAP issues with the Financial Stability Board as global regulator can include a disclosure scenario in their extreme stress testing alongside pandemics and cyber attacks.</p>
<p>And she&#x27;s not the only one preparing documentation. In that same month, May of 2024, the Vatican published guidelines covering supernatural occurrences and the possibility of contact with aliens. The document advises bishops on how to respond to findings of an organic nature requiring scientific investigation. &gt;&gt; Yeah, why now, right? Why now? I guess we we&#x27;ve been long overdue, but why now? I guess it is time. Maybe that&#x27;s what it is.</p>
<p>But yeah, I guess they have been preparing and but and uh for I guess ever since 2017 2018, you know that that UFO that night go night night vision goggle footage where where there&#x27;s a fighter jet chasing a UFO. Uh yeah, ever since that clip, the New York Yeah, New York Times actually leaked it. Then the Pentagon confirmed it. Yep. The Pentagon UFO clip.</p>
<p>I believe it came out back in 2017 or 2018. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. But ever since then, yeah, every year we have gotten bigger and more stuff. Although not as much, but you know, more sightings back in 20 uh 2024 with the New Jersey drones, but they were drones, right? Yep. That&#x27;s what they said.</p>
<p>Uh so we had that. We had the Las Vegas backyard crash. We had the Miami Mall situation. On top, we had whistleblowers coming out left and right talking about it. We&#x27;ve had UAP hearings.</p>
<p>And in one of the UAP hearing, they even confirmed, yep, the the Nordic aliens are here. There are four alien species here. That&#x27;s what they said. Whether it&#x27;s real or not, that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s a different point. But they&#x27;re talking about in they talked about it in in a UAP hearing that rep reptilians, the insecttoids, the mantis, the gray aliens, and the Nordics, right? The tall whites and the Nordics.</p>
<p>Two different species. So, but I believe they said Nordics. I could be wrong. I always get mixed up with the Nordics and the the tall whites. that plus David Gush.</p>
<p>You had uh that eyes wide open guy as well. I&#x27;m always forgetting his name. News Nation did a video. Uh they they revealed that eggshaped UFO video and a lot of people made fun of that. But okay, but yeah, point is point is for for a long ass time now.</p>
<p>It has been overdue and for years now they have been giving us bite size information. They&#x27;re spoon feeding us and maybe now it is time that we get something. ations. The interpretation is that the Vatican is positioning extraterrestrial life as being children of God. According to the Metro UK, the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology also issued an advisory report to the government on contact with aliens.</p>
<p>It recommended increased funding for radio astronomy, expanded SETI programs. Remember that one? And advanced signal processing for analyzing signals from space. &gt;&gt; Christina, just a bad right. Shout out to Christina out here. Check this out.</p>
<p>Shout out to the homie secure team. We&#x27;re going TO MOVE THE HELL ON. We got a massive UFO here. Roll it. I want to start our dive down the rabbit hole today with [music] our first eerie piece of UFO sighting footage that occurred and was recorded out of Prospect, Connecticut, [music] where you guys are about to see what appears to be a cluster of glowing lights hovering silently over a wooded area, changing formation, breaking apart.</p>
<p>Love it when they break apart and silent over my house silently. Why not my house? I mean, somebody&#x27;s house on Connecticut. I wish it was my house, but &gt;&gt; and moving in ways that [music] just don&#x27;t line up with anything conventional. So, before we go further and analyze this [music] footage, go ahead and check this out. &gt;&gt; Is it picking you up? &gt;&gt; Whoa.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s kind of flashing. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Is it moving? &gt;&gt; What is [music] that? It&#x27;s freaking me out. That&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Yeah, freaking me out. &gt;&gt; Okay, guys. So, [music] that one&#x27;s pretty bizarre, I have to say.</p>
<p>And I think most of you will agree. And this is one of those clips where the longer you watch it, [music] the less comfortable the conventional explanations become. But somebody&#x27;s just going to say it&#x27;s AI and then you know the rest, right? But now interesting question. AI or not? I don&#x27;t. Yeah, this one is hard to say.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems legit. Don&#x27;t it does not feel like it&#x27;s AI but there are clever ways to make an AI video and make it look insanely real especially with you can always you know take the video from AI edit it out and add background audio where it feels like that&#x27;s somebody in this case like there was a woman talking right so makes it even it feel it makes it feel real so there&#x27;s always ways like that you can always make AI videos sound and look even more real so there&#x27;s always going to be that aspect to it But otherwise, yeah, looks legit. I guess &gt;&gt; this footage captured just after 1:00 a.m. on October 31st, 2025 [music] in Prospect, Connecticut by a couple who were standing out on the deck of their parents&#x27; home looking toward the wooded mountain behind the property in the distance. And according to the witness, she first noticed a glow in the distance and tried to explain it away, wondering if someone might be up there with maybe like a fire [music] or something like that.</p>
<p>But that idea didn&#x27;t last long. What she was looking at wasn&#x27;t static. It wasn&#x27;t sitting still in the sky, and it wasn&#x27;t natural. Not to her or any of the other witnesses. The light began as a flickering clustered glow as you guys are seeing here as I replay this uh morphing into [music] a straight structured line and then almost deliberately uh breaking into four or five [music] separate orbs uh each moving off on its own path in different directions or was described [music] as such and that alone rules out a lot of the mundane explanation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is it like one object in the sky or five different objects just sitting together, chilling together with their parking little ass parking brakes on or something like that? Yeah, hard to say though. &gt;&gt; The object was described [music] as being roughly the size of a small car emitting colors that shifted between white, purple, and [music] green. Those kinds of color changes are often reported in cases involving [music] either extremely advanced propulsion systems or some form of luminous [music] energy field surrounding the craft. Something we&#x27;ve seen repeatedly in encounters [music] involving silent low visibility triangular platform.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We had a similar uh kind of sighting with the triangle-shaped UFO I believe somewhere around Pentagon a couple of years ago. You you know what I&#x27;m talking about, right? If you&#x27;ve seen it, you probably know, but we had that. Yeah, it was quite similar to that &gt;&gt; forms and [music] craft. And the silence here is key. There was no engine noise, no rotor sound, no jet wash, [music] nothing for nearly 4 minutes.</p>
<p>As reported, this object hovered, [music] pulsed, reconfigured itself, and then vanished completely. The witness says that she was genuinely terrified while her husband [music] was left absolutely speechless. That&#x27;s not how people react to airplanes or [music] hobby drones. That&#x27;s the reaction of people who know that. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, somebody&#x27;s going to say it&#x27;s AI and that&#x27;s it. How do you What&#x27;s the best way to know if a video is real or not? I would say we need to have an AI that can tell us if the video is legit or AI. We need that anti- AI kind of AI if that makes sense. So that&#x27;s number one. Secondly, I would say if you got a lot of people recording it and posting it from their angles, from their viewpoints and the the videos going viral on the internet, uh, and you got multiple people in the comments saying, &quot;Yeah, I saw that, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw that, too.&quot; and they share their images, their videos. I guess then, you know, it&#x27;s going to have a lot more validity and credibility and uh there&#x27;s that. But I guess the but yeah, what do you do when you don&#x27;t have that? I guess that&#x27;s when you need this so-called like anti- AI. So, it can it can tell us whether the video is AI or not. Yeah, we need that.</p>
<p>And I do believe somebody&#x27;s going to make it. I guess they&#x27;re they&#x27;re leaving a lot of money on the table. I mean, somebody can make that and be like, &quot;Yeah, give me $10 a month.&quot; You know, somebody can always do that crap and do the subscription thing. So, upload videos after videos into it and find out if the video is genuine or not. I guess that&#x27;s going to be useful for sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If you&#x27;re seeing something that [music] doesn&#x27;t belong. So, yeah. uh whether we&#x27;re seeing something here [music] that is a nonhuman technology or a deeply classified sky. The lights [music] are so close together that they almost look like they&#x27;re touching and from certain angles they partially obscure one another as [music] if the object itself is rotating rather than the lights moving independently. So before we go any further, check this out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is a secondary clip. Yeah. What if that&#x27;s the TR3B? Now, the thing with with TR3B, knock it off, you little prince. [groaning] Oh, dang. Uh, yeah, my Bob is not working.</p>
<p>Just emptied out the entire mag. Oh, dang. It ain&#x27;t working. Or maybe Yeah, I got you right there. I I guess I I I I got it.</p>
<p>At least one light that. Okay, that small function. I I guess I got it. My aim&#x27;s good, bro. My aim&#x27;s good.</p>
<p>I learned from Call of Duty. &gt;&gt; What is happening? &gt;&gt; Those little cheeky buggers, man. They fix their light. They fix their light. Yeah.</p>
<p>Damn. They do it real time. They don&#x27;t wait, bro. They don&#x27;t wait. They don&#x27;t need their technicians.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re like, &quot;We&#x27;re going to do it on the spot right now.&quot; Yeah. Back to normal. Damn it, bro. I mean, I tried, but they fixed it. Yeah.</p>
<p>You got to be flipping my flapjacks. Now, that one is disappearing. So, is it rotating? This footage was captured on the night of August 30th, 2025 at around 10:30 [music] p.m. in Clinton, Utah. And it was witnessed by multiple people, not just one observer trying to make sense of &gt;&gt; I love that.</p>
<p>I love to hear that. But do we have different videos? &gt;&gt; Something fleeting. According [music] to the details provided, the object was first seen as a single glowing light before two additional lights suddenly appeared, snapping into formation and forming a perfectly balanced [music] triangle overhead. Each light was described as having an intense bluish white glow roughly 10 ft across and the [music] object hovered at an estimated 45° elevation in the [music] sky. At times it appeared completely stationary and then without warning it would shift position with movements ranging from slow and deliberate to extremely fast.</p>
<p>But what really stands out here is the cohesion of these [music] lights. They&#x27;re not drifting independently and they aren&#x27;t blinking in a navigation pattern. They move as a single unit maintaining space orientation and symmetry. And at moments the top light appears to change shape or rotate briefly passing in front of or behind the others. [music] That kind of motion strongly suggests a solid structure, not three separate objects.</p>
<p>[music] And once again, there&#x27;s no sound, no engines, no rotors. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like a TR3B. Now, some believe that TR3B is basically the the US military. You know, it&#x27;s dark ops. call it lock heat skunk works or dark operations.</p>
<p>Yeah, possible. Big possible. And I remember hearing about a conspiracy a long ass uh time ago too that uh people that usually get abducted. It&#x27;s basically like the US military coming in the TR3B to abduct people, bro. There was that too.</p>
<p>Um and it&#x27;s also the gray aliens, the real ones. And then you also had this thing called Graya Treaty which I obviously made a video on which you know the the the short version is back in I believe around the 50s u I don&#x27;t remember the exact time uh but let&#x27;s just say around the 50s with President Eisenhower the gray aliens made their uh their treaty so they they were like okay so we&#x27;ll give you technology and weapons in return we just want to have a base here and then the dual say base was also kind of part of it. Uh then you know that that conspiracy also kind of ties in with it too. So you had the dulce based situation but yeah so with Eisenhower they made the treaty and they were saying that yeah we&#x27;ll give you weapons technology and all that and apparently the processors the the the chips that we have in our phones and computers apparently comes from them. So they gave us a lot of technology and all that but in return they needed a small price because nothing is free.</p>
<p>So the price was they said we need a base. So Dulce say base and uh you know they want to work here and also they want to abduct some people as well &gt;&gt; because they want to do what they want to do and they would always give they were nice right so they said we&#x27;re nice we&#x27;ll always give the US military data and names of the people that we will abduct. So you know there was that conspiracy too. I&#x27;ve made a video on it. I&#x27;ll I can link you that later on if you want to.</p>
<p>But yeah, so you had that. Is it real? Is it fake? I&#x27;m not even talking about that. But we had that. Uh, insane if uh if real. But there&#x27;s also have been conspiracy theories and whistleblowers coming out and saying that while TR3B is essentially ours, it&#x27;s reverse engineer engineered based off of real UFOs.</p>
<p>Uh, but it&#x27;s basically, you know, us like the the America. It&#x27;s us humans. It&#x27;s uh and some of the US military has been abducting people just so I guess they want to have fun, right? They want to scare people. They want to have fun. So they have been doing that.</p>
<p>But sometimes it&#x27;s actually is real and people get abducted by those gray little those gray aliens. &gt;&gt; Noise, just a silent object [music] hanging in the sky behaving in ways that don&#x27;t match anything publicly acknowledged. And this is where the [music] comparison to the classic black triangle craft becomes unavoidable. For decades, people around the world have reported massive silent triangular objects often marked by three lights at the [music] corners, moving slowly over cities, hovering over rural areas, or gliding low and quiet [music] through the night. craft that appear to use light as a functional element, not just illumination.</p>
<p>Craft that don&#x27;t rely on wings or visible propulsion. And that some have said the light with which we&#x27;re seeing here is just some sort of after effect or glitch in between our dimension and another or the sort of bubble being created around the unidentified. &gt;&gt; How could you imagine that &gt;&gt; object? Now, whether this represents nonhuman technology or an extremely &gt;&gt; Yep, that one. Oh &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a classic one, right? Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s real or not, but remember seeing it. I&#x27;ve seen this a ton of tons of times, bro.</p>
<p>Vintage clip of TR3B style silent black triangle craft. So, we got three lights and one red light in the middle. The advanced black budget terrestrial platform. This is still open to discussion, but what isn&#x27;t open to debate [music] is that this is not a misidentified airplane. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be drones.</p>
<p>Does not seem to be a satellite or satellites. These explanations simply don&#x27;t hold up when you look at the formation stability, the silent operation, and controlled movement on display here. And as &gt;&gt; man, if we actually get a disclosure this year, my god, that&#x27;s going to be in the history books. That&#x27;s going to be insane based off of everything that&#x27;s going on right now. I mean, you would think that we&#x27;re going to have a disclosure.</p>
<p>I mean, people do I believe that we&#x27;re going to have eventually. Do I think it&#x27;s going to happen this year? I don&#x27;t know. Nobody knows, right? Uh, and yeah, if you&#x27;re a believer and based off of the stuff that you&#x27;re seeing, you&#x27;re probably questioning to yourself, is it project blue balls, project blue beam? Uh, is it going to are we going to get a real disclosure? And what are we going to get? Are they going to come out and just say, &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re not alone in the universe and that&#x27;s it. We&#x27;re learning about it and that&#x27;s it.&quot; Are they going to say, &quot;We&#x27;re not alone in the universe. We&#x27;re learning about it and we have made contact.&quot; And here&#x27;s the video.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the pictures. This is how they look like. Guys, don&#x27;t panic. Don&#x27;t panic. we&#x27;ve been working with them.</p>
<p>Or are they&#x27;re going to be like, &quot;Yeah, we don&#x27;t know where they come from. Uh, you know, they&#x27;re pretty bad. Run to the hills. Hide in your bunkers.&quot; I don&#x27;t know. Yeah.</p>
<p>But eventually something got to give. Eventually, we&#x27;re going to have the disclosure. Kind of excited. Kind of excited. And based on uh based off how based on how it goes.</p>
<p>Yeah. It might be nerve-wracking. Might be a bad ending. We might have a bad ending. Or we might actually have a pretty good one.</p>
<p>But the entire world will change the day that happens. Will it actually happen? That that&#x27;s the question though. Let me know in the comments. And did you see this video? Yep. If you have not seen this one, definitely check out because uh UFO crash retrieval programs pretty pretty insane.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a pretty uh insane one. Check it out and I&#x27;ll see you there.</p>
