            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In early 2026, the state of Michigan did something unprecedented. They didn&#x27;t just sue big oil for climate change. They sued them for antitrust. The allegation that for decades, a cartel of energy giants didn&#x27;t just compete with renewable energy. They actively conspired to kill it in its crib.</p>
<p>Imagine if the solar revolution didn&#x27;t start in 2010, but in 1980. Imagine if the electric car wasn&#x27;t a new luxury, but a standard feature of the &#x27;90s. We&#x27;ve been told for years that green energy was too expensive or not ready. But history tells a different story. A story of artificial scarcity.</p>
<p>Today we reooking at the suppressed innovations that could have saved the planet and why we repaying the price for a 40-year delay. The most effective way to kill a technology isn&#x27;t to burn the blueprints. It&#x27;s to buy them. Take the nickel metal hydride battery. In the &#x27;90s, this was the gold standard for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>It was durable, efficient, and ready for mass production. In 1994, GM&#x27;s battery division was sold to Texico, now part of Chevron. What did Texico do with this breakthrough technology? They didn&#x27;t build it. They sued anyone else who tried to. They used patent litigation to prevent large format NIMH batteries from being used in any electric cars for a decade.</p>
<p>By the time those patents expired, a generation of EV Progress had been wiped off the map. the tactic. This is called defensive patenting. You own the idea not to use it, but to ensure no one else can. In the late &#x27;7s, Exxon wasn&#x27;t just an oil company.</p>
<p>They were a solar company. They held some of the most advanced patents in photovalttaic technology. Their own scientists warned them in 1979 that to avoid global catastrophe, renewables would need to make up 50% of the world&#x27;s energy by 2010. What happened? Exxon didn&#x27;t pivot. Instead, they shut down their solar research, sold off the divisions to companies that would let them wither and began a 30-year campaign to convince the world that solar was unreliable.</p>
<p>This created artificial scarcity. By slowing down the learning curve of solar, they kept fossil fuels as the only affordable option, making trillions in the process. It wasn&#x27;t just patents, it was the law. In the 1960s, the oil industry lobbed Congress to block state backing for electric car research, claiming they were already on it and that government interference would slow them down. They used their trade associations to weaken fuel efficiency standards and block the infrastructure needed for EV charging.</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t just business, as the 2026 lawsuits alleged effort to synchronize assessments and align responses to competitive threats. The result, a regulatory moat that made it nearly impossible for a new energy startup to survive the valley of death between invention and mass production. So what is the true cost? It&#x27;s not just the price of gas, it&#x27;s the time cost. If we had adopted the battery and solar tech suppressed in the 70s and &#x27;90s, the energy transition would be finished by now. We wouldn&#x27;t be debating carbon taxes, we&#x27;d be living in a post scarcity energy world.</p>
<p>The scarcity was never about a lack of sun, wind, or ingenuity. It was a manufactured product designed to keep us paying a monthly bill to the status quo. But the bubble is bursting. From the 2026 antitrust cases to the collapse of solar costs, the suppressed history is coming to light. The question is, now that the secrets are out, how fast can we make up for lost time? Which innovation do you think was the biggest loss? the 100 m per gallon carburetor, the NIMH battery.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments. Don&#x27;t let the truth stay scarce. Like, subscribe, and share this with someone who still thinks green energy is new. I&#x27;ll see you in the next</p>
