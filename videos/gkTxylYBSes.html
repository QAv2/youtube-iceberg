            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>episode 249 with bethany rolando orlando rolando a fundraiser at a non-profit who we know through a mutual friend but more importantly are equally obsessed with ufos and we are both huge fans of dr steven greer&#x27;s movie and book unacknowledged it was on joe rogan episode 331 and i like it because it&#x27;s like the least it&#x27;s like the least sexy ufo it&#x27;s not you know abductions and this that it&#x27;s just a bunch of military officials talking about actual craft in the sky that have military that have radar returns that affect magnetic i guess receptors receivers it&#x27;s just a very you know it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a phenomena and it&#x27;s real and i hate it because most people look at it and roll their eyes and say take off the tinfoil hat or you know all right man yeah past the shrooms right but you mentioned it with our mutual friend and i was like holy [ __ ] friends ever since yes yes exactly exactly best friends ever since and i was like oh my god someone that likes this because normally i bring it up and they&#x27;re like you know go away and stop talking to me you brought it up and i was like oh my god someone who&#x27;s equally as crazy as me but that&#x27;s probably true it&#x27;s probably true but introduce yourself please well you already did i already did but you know i have to give you a chance to i&#x27;m bethany rolando and i&#x27;m a fundraiser for a non-profit and obsessed with stephen grier&#x27;s unacknowledged yes exactly who all of his films i went back and listened to his episode 331 he&#x27;s talking on this is back in like 2012. and please interrupt if because i will not shut up he was back is 331 i think it was 2012 and i&#x27;ve listened to it not that i&#x27;ve listened to it 100 times but he talks about talks about how that the film that he was doing at the time sirius s-i-r-i-u-s was all crowd-funded blah blah blah and then i remember him talking about the next movie which came out in 2017 unacknowledged that was all crowdfunded and then his most recent movie was all crowdfunded i haven&#x27;t seen this recent movie yet neither why close encounters are the fifth kind yeah how can you watch it is it on any on youtube is it just on youtube or can you i mean i definitely didn&#x27;t buy it the day came out on amazon prime but it&#x27;s i think it&#x27;s i think it&#x27;s on youtube now and yeah i&#x27;m not clocking because i didn&#x27;t do that i&#x27;ve been i haven&#x27;t watched it yet though i&#x27;ve had it for like i haven&#x27;t had it since it came out it came out right at the beginning of covid but i am literally like an evangelist for unacknowledged i think i&#x27;ve watched it the documentary like seven or eight times right now yeah and i remember one time i was traveling for work and i was out at a bar eating dinner and i became friends with all these strangers and then i literally got them back they were in the same hotel and i got it like up and running like on their tv i&#x27;m like if you could do one good thing today watch unacknowledged and then share that with at least one other person yeah it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like butters with the dmv like have you heard of our lord and savior like that&#x27;s what it is like can i show you wanting knowledge like what is that knowledge like well i&#x27;m happy you asked without the pamphlet here&#x27;s some literature but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve argued not argued yeah i&#x27;ve argued with myself on it because i&#x27;m a psychopath but also with my friend trey carney who i&#x27;ve known since middle school we&#x27;ve talked about it and uh our mutual friend who is very skeptical on it he was like i don&#x27;t get the point of it and the reason why i like dr grier&#x27;s work so what skeptical whenever he brought we brought it up i don&#x27;t remember if it was you or me who brought it up first but then the other of us chimed in and then he was like he was like but he&#x27;s a perfect example of someone that was like you know okay like i believe like you know the cia does shady stuff and you know there&#x27;s probably secret cabals but he was like ufos he was like uh-uh and you know like to normal because if you watch unacknowledged you look at thousands upon thousands upon that not in the documentary but i mean they have a whole filing cabinet full of government-issued documents yes acknowledging yes there is the thing is as ufos yeah and this is from people in different countries it&#x27;s not just for america yeah and and the most important thing is it&#x27;s not people like you and me who are just like aliens are real and it&#x27;s like well what is that based on these are i mean they had on john i had on larry holcomb the author of um um presidents and ufos in february i&#x27;m having on dr lynn katai who stephen greer mentions extensively in unacknowledged and when he was on joe rogan i&#x27;m so jealous it&#x27;s gonna be awesome i&#x27;m gonna hang out for that and just watch it absolutely you can i&#x27;m having on nick pope in december i wasn&#x27;t supposed to say that i was saving that as a secret whatever i&#x27;m having on nick pope in december who was the head of the ministry okay good everybody listening keep it a secret it&#x27;s gonna be all of our collective secret it&#x27;s all of my million viewers right but nick pope is was the head of the ministry of defense which is which is the uk&#x27;s department of defense of course it&#x27;s a ministry but their ministry of defense he was the head of their ufo program for like 10 years he&#x27;s coming on the podcast in december and i&#x27;m saying that to say the these it&#x27;s not just bethany and i sitting here yelling like ufos are real these are people that are incredibly incredibly high up i mean the least of not the least of which are presidents truman ufos or flying saucers given that they exist are not constructed by any power of earth jimmy carter i know ufos are real because i&#x27;ve seen one president gerald ford the u.s air force is doing the public a disservice by not declassifying everything they know about unidentified flying objects fife symington former governor of arizona during the phoenix lights march 13th 1997 who was also a former air force pilot said well it&#x27;s this is either a highly secret dod craft or it&#x27;s an alien craft and there&#x27;s no in between it&#x27;s also important to know that these are elected officials on both sides of the aisle yes yes uh or then not even like john podesta the head of hillary&#x27;s campaign he was pushing for ufo disclosure senator harry reid and then you have you have guys like i mean i don&#x27;t even know andrew rogers interview on one of those late night shows i can&#x27;t remember if it was jimmy fallon or jimmy kimmel um not like talking about the expansion of the universe and how bill clinton yeah become more and more likely that there is evidence of another life out there yeah um hiding it in plain sight that&#x27;s probably one of my favorite parts about the documentary is how the government is really and how they&#x27;ve worked with the mainstream media which i would really like to get into eventually this is hiding the whole idea in plain sight yeah and also you see from hollywood this um like slow oncoming slew of uh all these alien movies that come out around that period of time so but go ahead with what you&#x27;re saying yeah well no it&#x27;s but that&#x27;s but that&#x27;s exactly right i mean i think i was i don&#x27;t remember who i was with might have been with my friend matt in in baltimore shout out matt i love you but we were watching someone yeah shout out matt i love you matt we are watching some i&#x27;ve known matt since fifth grade matt knows how crazy i am but we are watching some oh it was crazy yeah right i know we&#x27;re all insane it was some like 80s action movie just run whatever but we were looking at them and it was like all these just like nordic like you know like square jaw blonde hair blue eyes guys with machine guns and it was like they were the bad guys and you just knew it watching the movies like they were the killer americans and it was like oh my god the bad guys and then like and then we watched like a we watched like a i think it was transformers 2 which came out in like the 2000s right why the difference between transformers and transformers too though like what no no no no no no the first one wasn&#x27;t transformers the first one was like a die hard movie okay yeah and then we watched like later that night we watched transformers too because we were having a really productive night and not and we were not smoking pot and but we were looking at it and like they were made like 30 years apart and in the second one they&#x27;re going to take down this evil bad guys and so you know it&#x27;s like optimus prime he&#x27;s like oh symbol and they they drive through some security checkpoint they blow everything up but what does it say on the bottom you know the words come out and it&#x27;s like you know unapproved nuclear program iran and we kind of paused and i was like and we just just stoned to [ __ ] and i was like isn&#x27;t it kind of funny how whoever the enemy is at that time you can tell 80s who was it it&#x27;s clearly soviet bloc nations right right 2000&#x27;s who is it clearly all the guys sitting on a bunch of oil in the middle east and as it goes on you can slowly see it start to shift to what china and it&#x27;s like but so we looked it up and the department of defense no [ __ ] has a liaison office in hollywood and their incentive is for a movie like say transformers hey you want all these realistic props instead of using shitty cgi right you want a real hum or a real f-22 we&#x27;ll let you use all that [ __ ] for free we&#x27;ll cover all the cost but if you could just send us your script ahead of time and maybe we make a couple edits and you know make sure that flag&#x27;s waving nice and well and oh there&#x27;s a guy with brown skin he&#x27;s the bad guy and just but there&#x27;s an actual incentive to do that and it&#x27;s kind of like what frank zappa said he was like uh things that like politics and hollywood are just the inner entertainment arm of the the military industrial complex like it&#x27;s all one big corporation and i was like that&#x27;s [ __ ] brilliant yeah right yeah but that&#x27;s what it is is you can sort of kind of push this id i mean we&#x27;re seeing it right now and today november 7 16 november 16th 2020 12 33 p.m eastern time right now we&#x27;re seeing it with big tech and but it goes every which way and one of the white ones it goes to hollywood too so like you know celebrities that i&#x27;ve never seen so much involvement with the election for instance from hollywood as i have you know trying to get everyone to go out and vote and they make their personal mission and they have these hashtags with all these non-profits that are tied to definitely one side of the aisle more than the other but i mean this has been going on for a very long time and it&#x27;s becoming more prominent with the increase in our usage in social media and social media by itself is a huge giant that needs to be um you know and i kind of go along with joe rogan on this and how they&#x27;re trying to claim that they&#x27;re a private business but then they&#x27;re also trying to seek out help and safety from the government yeah and that&#x27;s like you can&#x27;t prostitute you can&#x27;t intercept it too yeah so if you&#x27;re gonna be a private company by all means do that but if you&#x27;re gonna try to seek safety um and then claiming that you don&#x27;t censor because you know mark zuckerberg went on the record a few years ago saying that he wasn&#x27;t censoring anything on one side of the aisle over the other and then there was a lot of evidence of that actually happening in the years that came from that yeah and it definitely is something that the government needs to address and they need to establish moving forward because social media is a huge part of our life and it&#x27;s becoming even more part of our life and it&#x27;s going to continue to become more of a part of our lives and whenever you&#x27;ve got you know kind of that video i sent you about like the great reset and what they&#x27;re trying to do through the world economic forum and um so yeah but that&#x27;s me going on a rant no no no no it&#x27;s absolutely true because it&#x27;s not going back in the box right it&#x27;s not like this is some fad like pokemon go or something right where it&#x27;s like all right like this is you play pokemon go no i never did but so i played it briefly but i actually wasn&#x27;t allowed to play pokemon growing up well yeah no no we both both grew up in heavy christian households yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s devil warship right it was really weird whenever it first came out and you&#x27;d be walking around the park like i live in richmond virginia and you go out to like belle isle and then you just see a whole slew of people that are just all together like in a circle pre-copen obviously like just looking down at their phones just kind of walking around like zombies like trying to catch these pokemon and i don&#x27;t judge those people whatsoever if you&#x27;re out and you have the time to go and catch pokemon by all means go for it but as somebody who doesn&#x27;t play it it was just really interesting yeah it was yeah i remember when i wanted to do stand-up comedy in like 2016. comedy i did when yeah i never knew that yeah no i wanted to in like 2016 i was so psyched to do it right like right when my life was just like pretty much just like off i was like i had like one one wheel on the rails and i was just like i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just like a maybe that&#x27;s a microcosm of stand-up comedy is that my most [ __ ] up point i was like i&#x27;m just gonna go talk to people and yeah with that you can it&#x27;s a coping mechanism too yeah yeah mom always thought i would actually be really good at stand up because i&#x27;m like i have a very dry sense of humor and i love to pick on myself and other people yeah she thought i would always be really good at that yeah i think that&#x27;s i was just at like a [ __ ] up point but i remember like one of the jokes i wrote down was like pokemon hoe instead of pokemon go and it was like you can finally find those hot singles in your area and like a [ __ ] i was like this is gonna be the joke that brings me to the stratosphere and then i showed up at the place in athens georgia shout out athens and they were like you have the wrong day man you&#x27;re up next week and that was enough for me to be like well this isn&#x27;t meant to be [ __ ] this isn&#x27;t that what yeah yeah i was that was i&#x27;m not in a good spot that&#x27;s i remember me and my buddy kirby i love you kirby i was he was like i was like trying to stop drinking at that point in my life this is like summer 2016. and he like he was like i was like let&#x27;s go back and like play video games and like he was like i know we&#x27;ll make the night better and we like stopped at taco bell we picked up like sixty dollars of food is my favorite fast food chain ever and i&#x27;ve been i was an og fan of taco bell like i was going to taco bell back in the day my grandma used to take us when she would watch us and her post office was right across the street and so anytime i stayed with her i was like four or five six years old we would go to the post office and then we&#x27;d go through the drive through a taco bell so whenever people talk about oh how taco bell is so cool i should have definitely been one of the vips when they opened up that like resort down in florida or wherever it was like i should have gotten a ticket i did it and i was very sad but go ahead i&#x27;m pretty i&#x27;m all right well i guess i don&#x27;t like taco bell as much as you but point no fun guys [Music] i was like what the why am i going on taco bell rant media social media um but yeah pokemon hoe pokemon go yeah but it&#x27;s but they talk about to bring it completely back around but they talk about like using hiding it in plain sight right to keep people from bringing it up because you know it&#x27;s kind of like 1984 what was the party&#x27;s final command to not believe what your eyes and ears were telling you there&#x27;s something along those lines right and the ci and this is all declassified sounds like alex this is all the classified [ __ ] i&#x27;m saying yeah yeah you actually got your impression yeah it&#x27;s all the culture you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s under classified [ __ ] you can look it up i&#x27;ve got i&#x27;m just saying i have good sources it&#x27;s if you look at it it is declassified especially from like the chief of counterintelligence james jesus angleton we talked about hey we can because we can only cover up so many of these ufo sightings and again to classified air force things project blue book project sign project grudge all these things to say basically that&#x27;s where the kind of the trope of like um dr j ellen heineck you know that was swamp gas right and it&#x27;s in men in black which you saw was swamp gas bouncing off of jupiter but they realized there was like we can only do this to so many cases and they&#x27;re happening more and more frequently july 1952 12 saucers fly over dc they scrambled starfighter jets or sabers after them they&#x27;re like we can only do this with so many things so why don&#x27;t we just come up with a psychological warfare campaign and that campaign was just ridicule people and it&#x27;s worked fantastically because i mean what&#x27;s that guy um that that pilot for um japanese airlines flight i think 1628 over not that i know this over alaska where they spotted that huge ufo in like the late 80s and john callahan in unacknowledged who was like the number three in the faa yeah that that pilot was laid off despite having like 20 000 flight hours and he eventually got hired again because some professor um what the [ __ ] is his name some professor in the united states like made it his mission to get that guy rehired because he was like you have a fantastic pilot here but this guy got fired because he was like i&#x27;m a pilot like i know what i saw and this was this was a ufo and so there&#x27;s there is ridicule to where like you people don&#x27;t want us it&#x27;s something that actually leads me the one thing i don&#x27;t understand or know and maybe you do is how did you know dr greer get all of these people who witnessed it on his documentary like are they i mean a lot of them are older and so they&#x27;re probably you know retired in some sense you know i wonder if they felt or feared for their lives in any capacity after the release of the documentary because the government is not in favor of letting people know about this obviously that&#x27;s the whole point of talking um and so like do you know or do you have any thoughts on um so i know that he said of for every person for every person that&#x27;s like in the and also so running knowledge is like an hour it&#x27;s maybe i don&#x27;t know like an hour and 43 minutes long but like two hours long right oh my gosh i thought it was is it is it less than two hours i don&#x27;t know i mean i definitely don&#x27;t have the exact time like memorized but it&#x27;s his actual yeah yeah i know and it&#x27;s but so i know you know what that&#x27;s unexcusable podcast over thank you for showing up guys the link&#x27;s in the description in the bio but he actually does have on his uh youtube page serious disclosure is he has all of the witnesses that were on unacknowledged he has all of their full interviews up and it&#x27;s something like i think it&#x27;s 35 or 65 hours of all so like in unacknowledged like having to agree to do that how did it get them to agree to do that yeah are they agreeing to like protect them or are they just you know risking it is there any is there going to be any fall back are we are they worried about any fall back that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m curious about like yeah you know or is it because it&#x27;s unclassified materials that were pretty much discussed in the documentary there really is no we need an attorney here like to come and talk to us about this yeah i yeah yeah i know really right i guess what i need is yeah i don&#x27;t know but i do know he said for every one of those he said there are about a hundred that he has video of that said you can&#x27;t put it out until i&#x27;m dead so he said there&#x27;s a so unacknowledged is about one percent of the video he has so my answer your question is is i think 99 of them are like there&#x27;s going to be retribution they&#x27;re going to [ __ ] kill me and one one percent were just like you know whatever like big dick energy like i don&#x27;t care come at me bro and i don&#x27;t know some of the guys were really old they were probably just like i don&#x27;t [ __ ] care you know it&#x27;s in my opinion exactly exactly a very brave person because aliens is not an issue that is taken lightly and so let&#x27;s go into that because our mutual friend when we gave him our whole you know our whole uh cult speech it was so do you remember which of us brought it up first i said something i think we were talking about you know normal conversations like jfk was absolutely whacked by the cia because he did you know a normal tuesday conversation because because he didn&#x27;t want us to go to vietnam and you know the military industrial combats was like [ __ ] that guy like we want our cash and he was like do you really think they would do that just for an energy like just for like profit and i was like well i mean think about like the ufo idea it&#x27;s all like an energy conspiracy and he was like what and you were like have you seen unacknowledged and i was like yeah and he was like what is unacknowledged and we&#x27;re both like what and yeah so our dear friend that we are slowly red pilling we are taking we are we&#x27;re literally going to red tell him we are we have been in the process for everyone listening we have been in the process of taking his red pill virginity for the last month we have just that&#x27;s probably true and it&#x27;s funny though because like the first time we saw him he was like do you i think he likes it though he actually likes it he absolutely likes it yeah he&#x27;s never seen like bad people yeah he&#x27;s never said no he he no he he he&#x27;ll says the last time we&#x27;re all hanging out he said i&#x27;m still struggling with the ufo thing yeah yeah further explain this to me and i&#x27;m like i feel like out of everything that you know tommy and i have talked about like ufos are like the number one thing that you can totally jump on the bandwagon about yeah if you watch unacknowledged which i don&#x27;t know if he has maybe we should just keep pushing that but if you watch it they present so many government documents yeah really it&#x27;s it&#x27;s indisputable in my opinion yeah about the fact that ufos exist that they visited this planet that aliens exist and why so then the question becomes for me why aren&#x27;t we acknowledging it for the public and i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for our own safety i think it&#x27;s to protect you know corporate lobbyists creeds special interests because we could totally eliminate with energy that they have which is eons beyond what we have you know we could eliminate world hunger we could have water for everyone to drink it would just help us progress so rapidly yeah you know i don&#x27;t even think we would be ready for how well we could progress if we were just too you know welcome i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re here to harm us and i think that&#x27;s the number one portrayal that hollywood the narrative is trying to push out is that aliens are here to hurt people and they want to go to war with us but if you look at the fact that they were here on ufos and just trying to catch like see what&#x27;s going on yeah you know i mean if they wanted to hurt us because of the energy that they have and the technology that they have i feel like they could have done that i would have done it i&#x27;m a go yeah and you know i think that there are other planets as well in addition to the ones wherever they&#x27;re coming from and they might not even all be from the same planet you know they&#x27;re probably trading inner trading inner planets are planetarily interplanetary trading okay they&#x27;re doing that with each other sure and so we&#x27;re missing out on a huge opportunity that could really advance our entire society you know everyone in the world would benefit from yeah it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just the next level of evolution and and yet pharma go out of business and you&#x27;d have monsanto go out of business they would all go out it would be it wouldn&#x27;t even be comparable i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any i don&#x27;t i think it&#x27;s like a singularity i don&#x27;t think we can look past what it would be it&#x27;s just like this vertical wall of progress then they wouldn&#x27;t want to let that in and because lobbying is so heavy up on the hill you know and special interest and everyone has everyone in everyone&#x27;s pocket there&#x27;s no way that they would like they&#x27;re not going to go down without swinging no absolutely not i mean it&#x27;s kind of like what i had him on yesterday an undercover atf guy vince cheffalo and he and he said in this book you know every once in a while you&#x27;d be undercover and like a biker will put a gun to your head and try to get you to like you know crack because your reflexes to like grab your badge and be like you don&#x27;t want to kill an agent so they have to train to not grab their badge because what would an actual non-cop do you would just be like yo man why are you putting a gun on my head and then he addressed the the next thing he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s like to you like mr reader like in the answer to your question is well how did i not freak out and it&#x27;s not that i&#x27;m so badass he was like i figured by the time they had a gun at my head and i was acknowledging that there was a gun on my head they would have already pulled the trigger if they&#x27;re going to so the fact that i&#x27;m now aware of them having it to my head shows they&#x27;re not gonna do it and that&#x27;s what i kind of think of like ufos it&#x27;s like by the time we see them and they&#x27;re here like dude if they wanted to ice us they would have you know like what do we do to like tense at night yeah like what do we do to like tense in iraq we drop lasers here probably if they wanted to no exactly we wouldn&#x27;t like think if you&#x27;re just like a mujahideen fighter in the middle east and you&#x27;ve got sandals and a 50 year old ak in a tent and a laser-guided bomb from above the clouds probably over the horizon takes you out you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s coming it&#x27;s just you&#x27;re just not there one second and we&#x27;re what maybe 30 40 years ahead of them technologically what would a race do thousands of years ahead of us we just we just wouldn&#x27;t be here so to our mutual friend and to everyone listening is are you know i think that there&#x27;s almost like a straw man argument against aliens because it&#x27;s like okay what you know the people would freak out they&#x27;d jump out of their windows and it&#x27;s like no to me although there is philosophical implications i have more faith in people than that so do i but i look at like how bob lazar talked about it on joe rogan he was like sure you know he&#x27;s like it&#x27;s crazy to think okay there&#x27;s another society out there in the universe he&#x27;s like but i&#x27;ll be honest like i didn&#x27;t really care about that i just cared about the technology i didn&#x27;t care where it came from right and it&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of how i look at it is like that is a whole argument religiously philosophically every single sure but i try to just so what i try to do though is to the skeptic i try to bring it down to one level i&#x27;m like well let&#x27;s look at something we do know right we know oil companies don&#x27;t like electric cars we know that although florida is the sunniest state we know that they they uh they lobby heavily to not allow solar panels there or they put up a lot of red tape to get them we know that happens we know that dick cheney&#x27;s company halliburton made 43 billion dollars in profit off the invasion of iraq on the deaths of 1.5 million civilians we know that happens none of this is a conspiracy we know that apple throttles your battery life so you have to buy a new one if we know all of that if 2008 we know these [ __ ] just take money and just cut people home they don&#x27;t care if we know that what is the single biggest vice grip they have on the balls of the world is our they can literally and figuratively turn the lights on and off the petro dollar the fossil fuels that is they have that over everyone right it&#x27;s like human trafficking why do they give these girls like heroin because make them addicted so even if they want to run away they can only go like an hour before they&#x27;re like i have to get because i&#x27;m having withdrawals i&#x27;m freaking out they have us on the petro dollar they could shut off your laptop they could shut off your car just the oil shipments stop we know that&#x27;s real so if something showed up theology spirit philosophical all that aside of oh my god there&#x27;s another living species if they showed up from light years away in any sort of meaningful time we would have to go okay there&#x27;s clearly a power source no pun intended that is out of this world for them to get here again don&#x27;t even worry about the philosophical implications but object or ufo came from planet a to place b that requires a lot of power right what is that power source well if that power source subverts your petro dollar grip on the balls of the world well if you&#x27;re in charge and you&#x27;ve worked really hard over the last century or two to build up this grip on the world are you gonna are you gonna give it away no and that to me that is the easiest explanation for why you&#x27;re covering it up when you think about it that way you go oh it&#x27;s not something people can&#x27;t handle it you&#x27;re like oh no it&#x27;s just these same [ __ ] that have been [ __ ] us in the ass every day for the last century yeah this was par for the course and that i hate this because like you&#x27;re giving i made that claim and then you&#x27;ve not backed it up with all these different examples yeah but but we know that&#x27;s the truth right i mean think of like music industries right early 2000s like limewire it has to go because it was taking other money right it&#x27;s not that they cared that you know it&#x27;s not like we can&#x27;t have five-year-olds listening to you know little john like you know to the windows to the walls to sweat drops down my balls no they&#x27;re like we&#x27;re losing money to me that&#x27;s all it is we&#x27;re losing money that&#x27;s all it is right so if a ufo shows up and there&#x27;s some guy like bob lazar it&#x27;s like hey man we can reverse engineer that and just have clean drinking water for everyone because desalinization of the ocean&#x27;s water is an energy-intensive process but if we just have limitless energy right i mean why was eisenhower so obsessed with nuclear energy because it would be quote energy to cheap to meter it&#x27;s just the entire thing is this free power source so if there&#x27;s a power source that shows up and is essentially free well you got all these guys who their grip on the world is it&#x27;s certainly not their personalities it&#x27;s certainly not a a product they offer you know they&#x27;re not winning us over because they&#x27;re great you know speakers they&#x27;re winning us over because when you step out of line your country gets destroyed right if someone comes down it&#x27;s like hey here&#x27;s the alien battery just [ __ ] plug it in your house runs for the next thousand generations well now all of a sudden you don&#x27;t need to vote for the guy who&#x27;s taking money from you know exxon mobil or something it doesn&#x27;t matter to me that&#x27;s just when you break it down to that to me i&#x27;m like oh that&#x27;s like the least sexy most realistic most plausible explanation and rant but right i mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what i think and again for everyone that&#x27;s still skeptical don&#x27;t listen to bethenny bethany and i watch unacknowledged acknowledgements unacknowledged holy [ __ ] it&#x27;s i mean it was a five-star admiral lord hill norton from uh from uh from britain&#x27;s ministry of defense who&#x27;s the head of mi6 mi5 they&#x27;re the raf everything well even beyond that though look at the documents that dr greer brings up which are how they&#x27;re working with mainstream media to make sure they avoid mentioning anything about sightings or trying they literally say that they are working with the media to dissuade the public from looking into the issue yeah but that&#x27;s i mean we&#x27;re all skeptical about government i don&#x27;t care about what side of the aisle you&#x27;re on or not we&#x27;re at a place in our in america where we don&#x27;t trust government you know trump&#x27;s in office people hate him if a democrat&#x27;s in office people hate him and no one is trustworthy of government and so for me i think this is the best time for people to be watching something like unacknowledged because there&#x27;s a natural skepticism there yeah so whenever he pulls out all of these files from decades ago right like i mean this is not happening like i mean it probably is happening yesterday but i mean this is from like a while ago yeah and just talking about how they&#x27;ve had mainstream media wrapped around their finger from then and then that ties into how government mainstream media have this relationship into today and then you look at what mainstream media is trying to do yeah and one should be trusting mainstream media either i don&#x27;t i also don&#x27;t care what side of the aisle you&#x27;re yeah yeah and yeah and you&#x27;re right then the whole thing with social media and then them trying to seek out safety but then they&#x27;re trying to operate like a private company but then they&#x27;re working and pushing a narrative i mean it all ties together yeah and that&#x27;s why i ultimately am really passionate about it because government has too much power yeah and i don&#x27;t think it is within their rights to hide something that the public could benefit from that the world could benefit from and then you take it a step further and you look at how we&#x27;re probably not there we&#x27;re definitely not afforded to unacknowledge the only government that&#x27;s aware of this yeah and so then you look at the fact that all of these governments are working together to hide it from the public all over the world what else are they hiding from the public all over the world that&#x27;s how my mind works yeah yeah no it&#x27;s no it&#x27;s exactly it is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of what like george carlin said it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a big club and you ain&#x27;t in it like that&#x27;s just that&#x27;s what it is right because you don&#x27;t want because that frees everyone from under the thumb of the government and not only that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s i think they bring it up and unacknowledge i know larry holcombe brings up that&#x27;s another insane book um presidents and ufos who&#x27;s been on here and another one leslie kane how long ago did you have that podcast because i think i missed it i think um i&#x27;ve had him on twice and i think both in like the last four weeks i&#x27;m gonna go back in and watch them i love i love your guests that you have on your products they&#x27;re very fascinating i can&#x27;t believe that you just started it last year and like the caliber people that you&#x27;re getting on is very impressive to me making me blush thank you it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s definitely yeah it&#x27;s definitely definitely working better than i ever thought i would not to like not sell confident about it yeah i hope so meant to do i fully believe that yeah and i&#x27;m fully going to use this to just it&#x27;s all a front just to get closer to the ufo that&#x27;s what the whole it&#x27;s a long time it is it is absolutely true the long the long long term the long con is hey if there&#x27;s like an eight decade conspiracy to keep ufos secret well hey you gotta fight the long con with the long kong so i&#x27;m just coming in here here you are yeah right in the game right i mean i mean [ __ ] what it what does joe rogan do you can go back to his first episodes he&#x27;s obsessed with ufos to having on commander fraver having on ball bazaar having on george knapp jeremy corbell having on all these guys talking about ufos that&#x27;s what actually got me on to joe rogan was i can&#x27;t remember which one it was but it was about aliens and ufos and i was hooked yeah ever since yeah yeah and that&#x27;s so now we&#x27;re kind of getting thrown a curve ball though right because we just went on this long rant about why they&#x27;re keeping it secret but then this past i won&#x27;t say july maybe june there&#x27;s a new york times article by co-authored by leslie kane the author of ufos generals and government officials who have tried to get on this podcast but she said no thank you very politely but it&#x27;s podcast miss kane please come on my podcast now i&#x27;ve messaged her a lot and she&#x27;s very respectfully said no so hopefully soon but it&#x27;s she she co-authored that new york times article that rogan screenshotted and posted on his instagram that the military or the pentagon has in its possession quote craft not of this world and that kind of just went under the radar right right right it&#x27;s right of course it did yeah but it did yeah also just like how you sent me an article about what happened in beirut oh yeah right and so that this is different this is sex trafficking or human trafficking or allegedly but like that i totally miss that story i don&#x27;t know if that was on the front page of any paper or like a friend of mine i read the news all the time yeah and so like the fact that i didn&#x27;t even see that story happen and you were asking me about you know what do you think about this and that i&#x27;m like i honestly have no idea the fact that you just sent me this and i&#x27;ve never seen it is blowing my mind and i need to do research before i come to any conclusions about like when it actually happened but it&#x27;s just another example yeah now that does blow my mind because i was a there&#x27;s a huge [ __ ] explosion i actually got on an eod tech explosive ordnance disposal guy who worked with the secret service i had him on to talk about the beirut explosion and i came in and i was like was it a government operation was this black ops and he was like i mean probably not and i was like oh but i was like [ __ ] but yeah he went on to something there i know i was like i was like this is and he was just like i mean no he was like there&#x27;s and i was like [ __ ] but this guy was in the secret service and uh did bomb detection when like i think under bush and obama whenever they&#x27;d go to like china they&#x27;d bring him up i think i heard that episode yeah will will ellie will healy he&#x27;s a cool guy he uh he taught me on air how to uh make homemade explosives from home depot so well let&#x27;s not do that because you don&#x27;t want that well i mean wave to the nsa because i think that episode really put me on there he&#x27;s just like you gotta go and just buy you gotta buy like acetone you gotta buy and i was just like all right just i&#x27;m on that list now not that i haven&#x27;t already been but it&#x27;s yeah but it gets weird because episode 151 with my buddy trey carney we discussed this and we&#x27;re like isn&#x27;t it kind of weird how there&#x27;s this story in the new york times posted by joe rogan and it just it kind of just it was like the emperor has no clothes everyone just kind of looked away and i was not trey and i trey and i were freaking out and i was like i had him on and he was like did you read it and i was like i read it and we were going back and forth but it does seem weird because that that completely goes in the face of my whole argument that like they&#x27;re keeping it quiet why would they post why would they make that is is it like a chess move in the long con because 2020 is so crazy they&#x27;re like let&#x27;s throw it out there now no one&#x27;s even gonna pay attention so you&#x27;re thinking that the media is in on it too so they&#x27;re like if we&#x27;re gonna so is that your assumption so assuming that media is also in on it they&#x27;re like because 2020 is so crazy let&#x27;s go ahead and publish the story and it doesn&#x27;t actually gain traction yeah or are you of the mindset that media is not as involved with government dealings at her level necessarily i&#x27;m not talking about the executives but maybe as a journalist you know i would like to think although i am very skeptical about a lot of journalists today i would like to think that there is that there are still journalists out there that aren&#x27;t a part of the smoke screen like the um the back room dealings and that they would want to get a story out there if they had the information yeah you know like that&#x27;s what happened with amy robock at abc news i mean she had the jeffrey epstein story for three years and abc news would not let her put it out there and you know by some way somebody who worked there caught her on tape in between the segment and she had talked about everything that she had and then she ended up being punished yeah and it&#x27;s like on one hand i totally see what you&#x27;re saying about you know media and it&#x27;s kind of you can see it as one and that they&#x27;re in with the government and i do believe that but then on the other hand i do think that there are journalists out there that are really passionate about journalism and that if they&#x27;re if they have a story they want to be just because you&#x27;re naturally competitive i mean if you&#x27;re a journalist and you have to break the story first and so like if you want to have a career in that you you have to be very aggressive in pursuing that so it&#x27;s like i could see it both ways i could see it where they would want to publish it because they think no one&#x27;s paying attention because of 2020 but then i cannot also see them wanting to publish it because maybe it is 2020 and people are paying more attention to the news than they otherwise would have been okay yeah i i definitely what do you think no i don&#x27;t know i i definitely see that it&#x27;s i think did it gain traction with anyone else and what what on paper again was this this was in the new york times new york times yeah which is why it gets hairy the god of all yeah which is why it gets a little hairy because it&#x27;s like why why was that there right but then but then we also have the pentagon acknowledging uh commander fravors i guess flir forward-looking infrared the like the camera tape of the ufo off the coast of excuse me san diego in 2004 saying that&#x27;s not ours just the pentagon just saying that&#x27;s not ours like okay and like you know just but they just that that was just something so like a few months ago the pen it wasn&#x27;t the pentagon that like admitted that they had seen ufos yeah because they can definitely publish that like on my own social media i know you know 2020 is a crazy year yeah went for the you know government admitting that they acknowledge ufos and no one is paying attention to it and it&#x27;s not getting any coverage on msnbc fox news um and then by the way if you haven&#x27;t seen it yet go watch that acknowledge yeah yes but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s but no that&#x27;s yeah that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m talking about like the pentagon just just you know just like nothing yeah that&#x27;s not ours that&#x27;s definitely an alien there&#x27;s a video of it that&#x27;s an alien and it just kind of flew under the radar maybe it&#x27;s cognitive maybe no one maybe nobody really does give a [ __ ] maybe it&#x27;s not so i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true i think you have so many people who are so passionate about human rights and social activism that if they understood what would happen if we introduced interplanetary trade that we like i can i mean i would go out and protest that yeah like i mean it&#x27;s it helps everyone in the end on the entire planet yeah and i understand it&#x27;s not a strict black and white issue either i&#x27;m sure that they would have their wants and needs and then we&#x27;re trying to present our wants and needs but you know there needs to be a discussion of it yeah and i think i have more fees than people around the world that if we made it an open topic of discussion that they could they could handle it i don&#x27;t see people going and jumping off buildings exist we&#x27;re so desensitized to it we&#x27;ve seen how many but hence hollywood and in movies and media and how often they push how many alien movies came out in the last 20 years yeah so like i mean i think that we&#x27;re desensitized enough to it that we could totally introduce it and for the most part everybody would be okay with it and they&#x27;d be like okay yeah that makes sense and then okay now let&#x27;s go to the next level like what do we do next yeah that&#x27;s how i think about it yeah i don&#x27;t think people would freak like we have rovers on mars like we have phones that beam live video into our pockets super computers like we know the universe is expanding we you know we watched on live tv as two passenger airplanes hit the world trade center like there&#x27;s covid like there&#x27;s for the most part people are like that&#x27;s crazy go look at the great reset like you should like people to go watch that too because i mean that&#x27;s something that is put out and you can watch their own videos and it freaks me out whenever it&#x27;s them talking it&#x27;s not even like some conspiracy theorists seriously there is talking it&#x27;s not me and you and it&#x27;s not i did send you a video i think of a guy that i really like and i&#x27;m blanking on his name or else i give him a shout out i&#x27;m so sorry um but and he uses their videos and then kind of breaks it down in like 20 minutes and they talk about you know it&#x27;s we already helped people with limbs and being able to walk again and all the best think about what we can do people are so afraid to think um to speak freely because they&#x27;re afraid of like what their thoughts are and then they start talking about how they want to infiltrate our thoughts yeah we want to create space for free thought and it was like [ __ ] what the [ __ ] did you just say yeah that&#x27;s scary it terrifies me um i i really have to pee i&#x27;m going to pause this i&#x27;m not going to make you monologue i&#x27;ll pause it and we&#x27;re back sorry i had to piss because i have the bladder of a pregnant woman or a racing what&#x27;s the saying i have to piss like a racehorse i have to piss like a pregnant woman i have no idea i&#x27;ve of course of course all right you guys are weird up in maryland but you also have wild horses in maryland we do we do have [ __ ] yeah i was telling you about how i went to puerto rico and that i saw this horse like on his way to go meet his buddies and that was like the coolest thing ever just to think about the life of a horse that is wild and it&#x27;s like okay he like goes and eats some hay he goes and meets up with his like girlfriend and then he&#x27;s like all right girl i gotta go i gotta give my buds and so then i was driving a golf cart on like down this pathway and then on to the beach and then there were like a whole slew of horses that he eventually like caught up to and was just like hanging out with and they were just chilling do you think i think so commander fravor was on lex friedman&#x27;s podcast yeah talking about ufos and how they were like hovering over water when he saw them i&#x27;m just thinking of horses because he was like what if they were just talking to dolphins like what if we&#x27;re not like the smartest thing here well i mean we don&#x27;t even know anything about the ocean right like we talk about face all day long but the fact that we don&#x27;t even invest enough money into yeah we can&#x27;t even explore the deepest of the deeps of the ocean we only have access to places like antarctica yeah we&#x27;d be able i think to what the [ __ ] is going on in antarctica what is going on and again you know for every this wasn&#x27;t an unacknowledged so anyone that was hoping to just stay on ufos now this is your stop i hope you enjoyed the train you can get off now for everyone else you know put up your tray seats and or your tray backs and from the ceiling are now going to fall tinfoil hats so put them on and uh because what the [ __ ] is going on in antarctica dude i have no idea it&#x27;s crazy i have a thousand different conspiracies running through my head um but like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s astonishing to me that every single country has a flag down there but then they all agree that there&#x27;s no way to like massively like you can&#x27;t just i mean you can go down there and you can tour it and all of that but you can&#x27;t get to certain places yeah and i i always ask you know what&#x27;s going on in those certain places yeah and well it&#x27;s the perfect like denied territory right i mean because it&#x27;s every country has in common yeah you know yeah not the north pole no one cares about the north pole north pole is just like there&#x27;s a lot of oil up there so we&#x27;re out there like you know everyone&#x27;s trying to stake a claim but the south pole is like no one will go there we all it&#x27;s like the one thing we can agree on like we will kill each other at the millions but all of a sudden we&#x27;re all just coming together like well let&#x27;s hey south pole like come on you know we can all be adults and i&#x27;d like to see it is there an actual agreement written up about xact if there isn&#x27;t i haven&#x27;t read it i think there&#x27;s an agreement that no one will stick a claim to it that could be complete horseshit i might be fake news i might be yeah i might be fake news like i said hey everyone that all citation-backed discussion stopped at minute 51. this we are now this is now you know you are now here at your own volition we&#x27;re we&#x27;re not staying on track there&#x27;s no citations don&#x27;t use it against us there is no citations backed up by nothing this is wild speculation this is but you know what at least at least we say that because most mainstream news places they do that anyway and just throw it off as news at least right and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s crazy to me is that you have actual news outlets that are going out there and they release videos of people moving their lips and you see what they&#x27;re saying and then they try to discredit it or label it as disinformation but then a lot of journalists they don&#x27;t want to give up their sources i understand that but then they just say like our source and then we just take that automatically as truth yeah or we read the story in the paper yeah yeah we&#x27;re online who reads a paper these days yeah well i always get that when i post project veritas [ __ ] on facebook my friends are like i&#x27;ll just have you know that he&#x27;s a well-known right-wing conspiracy theorist i&#x27;m like i don&#x27;t think so but let&#x27;s i&#x27;ll just humor you let&#x27;s say he is what is the video of the man&#x27;s mouth saying you know and it&#x27;s that who was it scott fogle who was the guy in 2016 like yeah man like we we yeah we use mentally ill people to do [ __ ] for us make no mistake i remember posting that and that was yeah that was a guy working on hillary clinton&#x27;s campaign and i remember that and mind you i was still pretty left at that point but i remember thinking this was two two and a half years after i lost my brother&#x27;s suicide i was like i&#x27;m last i was i was but this was two and a half years after i lost my brother&#x27;s suicide number thinking i was like [ __ ] that&#x27;s evil that&#x27;s pure evil we pay mentally ill people to do [ __ ] for us make no mistake i remember posting that and one of my friends was like dude james o&#x27;keefe is a fart i didn&#x27;t know anything about him at the time and i was like that may be true ma&#x27;am but i remember i was like but i was like if you just if you just go to you know time stamp four minutes and 11 seconds what is the man in the in the video saying but i&#x27;m just saying they edit and i&#x27;m like what is he saying what is that man saying think if i sat here and just started screaming the n-word and saying kill all jews and someone said well okay but you know what cnn aired it and i&#x27;ll have you know cnn&#x27;s pretty left they&#x27;d be like what did tommy say at this time out of context or not that wouldn&#x27;t happen though nobody would look at cnn and say oh that&#x27;s too last well that&#x27;s what i think don&#x27;t pay attention to it if it comes out on cnn if it comes out on you know any mainstream media um then it&#x27;s pretty much just taken as the truth yeah and that&#x27;s my plea to people and anybody watching is you know there is a love hate that i have with technology and social media and the internet but one thing that it has done is given we the people the power to go and do our own research and you can you know there&#x27;s a lot of fake stuff out on the internet too but you&#x27;re smart enough to like go and read it and and decide for yourself um what actually is true and what isn&#x27;t true and now we we really as people need to harness that to our advantage and that comes with any topic not just aliens or not just antarctica yeah or not just you know whatever video james came out with um that&#x27;s for anything yeah yeah and it&#x27;s that&#x27;s one thing i always think is like people that think like that needs to be censored and it&#x27;s like why and so because people might believe it like that right there i&#x27;m like do you dick you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re not the babysitter yeah we&#x27;re out of precipice i guess is that the right word where impasse precipice crossroads crossroads where we have to decide do we want to help people think for themselves or do we want to free people to where they can come up with their own conclusions and i know government doesn&#x27;t want that they want sheeple that&#x27;s what i call them people who you know if you&#x27;re driving down the road and you get to a stop light and you see like six cars and one lane and then the other lane is totally empty and it&#x27;s like you know i&#x27;m like sheeple they just follow along you know why not just get in the left lane there&#x27;s less cars in the left lane or right lane it can be vice versa too yeah but it&#x27;s right it&#x27;s well it&#x27;s yeah it&#x27;s listen to what well they said that it&#x27;s not real or this didn&#x27;t happen and it&#x27;s like like but who said that like i always look at it as like you know well so and so yeah well snopes said i&#x27;m like dude snopes is a guy and his wife no different than me and that&#x27;d be like if you and i started we just called them who&#x27;s backtracking snobs and who made them that that&#x27;s like going to wikipedia and colleges don&#x27;t even let you for the most part use wikipedia as an information source if snopes was like einstein neil degrasse tyson and like carl sagan and they had like a whole like panel of like researchers and they live streamed they&#x27;re fact checking okay snopes is just a guy and his wife that&#x27;s it if that&#x27;s i could make something called hopes that i&#x27;d be like well you know are you checking out because it&#x27;s like an actual like yeah we&#x27;ll be like you could you could just check okay [ __ ] it tommy&#x27;s podcast well uh thomas podcast said that there&#x27;s election fraud so and what&#x27;s the first thing well that&#x27;s just a guy&#x27;s podcast exactly it&#x27;s just snopes it&#x27;s just cnn it&#x27;s just fox news like these these people aren&#x27;t like they&#x27;re not a cut above like they&#x27;re not you know sure i respect them for building like a multinational corporation like i&#x27;ll respect the games yeah right but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re just they&#x27;re just people like they&#x27;re just people like they go home and they like yawn and like look in the mirror like pop a pimple like take a [ __ ] you know go home and you know lay in bed and they&#x27;re just like ugh i don&#x27;t want to do this tomorrow they&#x27;re not some like almighty like you know deity and like a high pillar on top of the mountain like i will tell you truth my child it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re just [ __ ] [ __ ] like you and me and so if you can say snope said well be yourself like me not like you it&#x27;s it&#x27;s i guess i can&#x27;t be sometimes no it&#x27;s but you know it&#x27;s but and it starts so it starts so slowly with we can&#x27;t have alex jones yelling and ranting because it&#x27;s dangerous to the population oh my god so that is why i love joe rogan so much and we&#x27;re giving him all these shout outs i don&#x27;t know if you can link it down in your description for joe rogan i don&#x27;t think he needs my help that&#x27;s true but he actually says whenever he brings alex jones on he&#x27;s like you know we&#x27;re friends and i get a lot of hate for being friends with you but you say a lot of things that are true and alex struggles with his strategy of getting information out there and i do think he&#x27;s incredibly obnoxious yeah but i mean there were things that i was looking into that alex jones was like exposing back in the day i mean i like they talked in that last podcast about you know um i&#x27;m not gonna call it the brewery like i did the other night with you guys uh bohemian girl yeah yeah and so like that was actually something that i was looking into and then i found i was looking into it after alex jones released it but then i found his uh video about it and like the news that he had like released and i&#x27;m like oh my god like alex was literally ahead of the curve yes and he but because he is he doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s hard as someone who claims to be i don&#x27;t know if alex claims to be a journalist does he claim to be a journalist i don&#x27;t think so but you know it&#x27;s hard to red-blooded american how much do you yeah i know you&#x27;ve got that down how much do you care about what the public thinks of you versus just getting the information out there and he&#x27;s clearly built a following of those that are on the right um even though he claims to not be because he was actually very anti-bush and i was great he was incredibly anti-bush that&#x27;s the thing as was i though yeah and so like he i think it&#x27;s interesting that joe brings that up and i&#x27;m glad he brings out that talking point because i think it helps alex amongst like the people the millions of people that listen to joe rogan in terms of you know joe gets in trouble for being friends with them but he&#x27;s friends with him anyways because you know he&#x27;s a i think he&#x27;s probably a good person but like also the stuff he puts out there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that he puts out that is legitimately true yeah because he&#x27;s described by a lot of people no one pays attention to it except for his followers and he&#x27;s not given a lot of weight but he i mean he&#x27;s ahead of the curve on a lot of this stuff yeah and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very easy to discredit him because you just gotta pull up a clip of him being like you know interdimensional aliens are here they&#x27;re sucking the life energy from our kids i&#x27;m telling you joe i know there&#x27;s a post-human error coming it&#x27;s very easy to look at him and go this guy&#x27;s [ __ ] crazy but then you know that&#x27;s also something that like you have to ask yourself too like if you&#x27;re going to be like a professional podcaster which you should you&#x27;re really good at this um you know how much do you want to care about what what people think of you versus you actually saying and i know you have zero cares in the world but you know and joe rogan&#x27;s able to get away with it alex jones is able to get away with it but with really only the right side of the aisle and so that&#x27;s something that you&#x27;re gonna have to consider as you start to gain more followers and gain more traction um you know how much are you gonna care versus like what you put out it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s fascinates me yeah like inside of the business and like how old that works yeah no i don&#x27;t i i don&#x27;t care at all and it&#x27;s not even some edgy like you know i mean i&#x27;m very open that i lean more right but i&#x27;m also open that i voted for obama and then i voted for romney and that is just like i don&#x27;t know if i missed this story but you&#x27;re gonna have to follow me a little bit on i voted for i voted for obama when i was 18 in high school because it just seemed like a good idea i don&#x27;t know i was 18.</p>
<p>like a good idea hey man i&#x27;ll give him upgrade credit where credit&#x27;s dude he&#x27;s a good speaker and i think he&#x27;s hooked up half black president yeah i didn&#x27;t give a [ __ ] i was like [ __ ] yeah i was i was randy marsh from south park i was like hope it&#x27;s rage i was like it&#x27;s gonna be better still ahead like that&#x27;s what i was just admit that&#x27;s what i was 2012 after being pre-med as a bush though was it because of like i think so yeah probably like yeah because that seemed objectively bad i was like we aren&#x27;t supposed to be in iraq like even i was like a 15 year old i was like why are we in iraq like and then 2008 the financial crisis i remember i was really the primary reason i actually voted for obama is i can remember now this is when i first kind of getting obsessed with like biotechnology this was like two years before i decided i want to be a doctor and i was really interested in like stem cells and like i was like a one issue voter i was just like one guy wants to make it legal to do research on stem cells and advance advanced medicine and i looked at it as sort of like american exceptionalism i was like i hated that you know like germany and france and china were getting ahead and i was generally like 16 when i was like reading all this and i was like why aren&#x27;t we at the forefront and that&#x27;s what i wanted i was like i just wanted to see stem cell research and that&#x27;s why i voted for i can honestly say that&#x27;s why i voted for obama and in 2012 after being pre-med for like three years just studying non-stop around the clock i was like i like i want to help people i was like dude i like i want i also want a huge paycheck like that&#x27;s what&#x27;s getting me through this and i had two uncles who were surgeons and they both said they&#x27;re like if you know like this is gonna make your life hell on earth and when a bunch of not other people are going like it&#x27;s going to be great when a bunch of like lifelong physicians were telling me like this is going to be hell on earth i remember thinking i was like i don&#x27;t i was like [ __ ] that and so i voted for romney solely because i was like i don&#x27;t like the idea of obamacare aimed at romney yeah and then every party well that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re a cool person who actually has yeah deeper and more awesome callers are going to be like wasted who&#x27;s gonna vote [ __ ] off vote for the [ __ ] i want you know eat a bag of dicks or dirty commies but in 2016 i was had in a really bad place in my life as two years after i lost my brother to suicide i was doing and smoking a lot of weed and doing a lot of psychedelics and not a lot four times but that&#x27;s i mean i&#x27;m not even trying to like throw shade at bernie like but that&#x27;s why i vote for him because i was just like like i just you know maybe there&#x27;s some truth in that i was in like the worst spot in my life and i was like i need help and i moved home and as i started to get my life back to and i didn&#x27;t vote in the presidential election in 2016. it was that was right when i moved home and i just wasn&#x27;t in a good spot and then as i sort of started you know getting sober over the next coming years losing weight not all of it but losing weight working hard at graphic design working hard on this podcast i started to kind of become like pre-med me again i started to you know no one&#x27;s going to give me anything i have to pursue i have to go take what i want and i&#x27;m gonna get it but i&#x27;m not gonna let anyone stand in my way and that&#x27;s i just started resonating with trump and i know it&#x27;s like you know oh you [ __ ] nazi but i was like look like yeah sure he&#x27;s an [ __ ] he&#x27;s got an ego and a half but i was like i just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with putting your country first just like france should put france first and china i hate them china should put china first right it&#x27;s because to me i&#x27;m like the big thing that happened to me at that time in my life was self-love was like really i&#x27;m like i&#x27;m not a piece of [ __ ] it&#x27;s not my fault my brother killed himself and i was like and it&#x27;s not my fault you know friends around me aren&#x27;t happy like i need to take care of me so on a bigger scale i was like america needs to take care of america canada needs to take care of canada like because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s i mean it&#x27;s like an airline right when the emergency oxygen drops down please fix your mask before anyone else because if you pass out you can&#x27;t help anyone but if one person in the plane gets their mask on they can put on someone else&#x27;s mask who can do another person and it can take off but if everyone tries to help everyone else we&#x27;re all gonna pass out and we&#x27;re gonna die so that was my mindset was like i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with taking care of america like trump says a lot of crazy [ __ ] and yes unlike the surface i think he&#x27;s funny the memes are great but i mean ultimately i mean i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with like his second day in office he scrapped the was it the tpp the trans-pacific partnership which by the way the left and as a lefty at that time had been screeching against for four years as it was in the pipeline the trans-pacific partnership act hillary clinton a hemispheric western open market without borders i was like that&#x27;s objectively bad like i don&#x27;t and so i was just like get it away get rid of it i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything we&#x27;re gonna bring back troops oh but we&#x27;re the carbs the curds i&#x27;m like no one you didn&#x27;t know who the kurds were yesterday but now that trump is saying i&#x27;m like i don&#x27;t because look we can keep our troops there and they can die or we can bring them home and these people can die it&#x27;s cold but someone&#x27;s going to die yeah i&#x27;m gonna stand by what i think bring him home i don&#x27;t give a [ __ ] don&#x27;t get in george washington don&#x27;t get caught up in foreign affairs and i know the world&#x27;s a lot more complex now but still so there are some things that i it&#x27;s the why i voted for obama are the same things why i voted for trump and that&#x27;s the truth is i was like hey let&#x27;s put all because what was obama and said we&#x27;re going to put money in again stem cells i don&#x27;t care what anyone thinks we&#x27;re going to do this so we don&#x27;t fall behind the rest of the world that&#x27;s just another way of saying america first that&#x27;s just he said hope and change but that&#x27;s another way of saying make america great i&#x27;m going to shut guantanamo he didn&#x27;t do it but he said it and to me i&#x27;m like that was i&#x27;m like we didn&#x27;t do it but no no he didn&#x27;t but still i&#x27;m i&#x27;m justifying his my draw to him i&#x27;m gonna take us out of iraq i&#x27;m like good we spent five trillion dollars over there we don&#x27;t need to do that these are all the same reasons why i voted for trump a week ago are the same reasons why i initially voted for obama so to me i&#x27;m like that&#x27;s so that being said that&#x27;s my whole like left and right jump so it&#x27;s when it comes to circle way around to your question my idea of how am i going to go forward doing a podcast to me it&#x27;s very simple i&#x27;m going to say what i believe in and i try to have on guests that challenge my belief so that i don&#x27;t become rigid and calcified in my position and ultimately at the end of the discussion even if we&#x27;re at each other&#x27;s throats agree to disagree man agree to disagree what a great country we live in that we can say that right my buddy ernie who is the antithesis of me me white skin looking like an aryan from new england republican ernie dark-skinned from mexico immigrant who worked in the democratic party like but we also used to drink vodka together in college and play mario kart and we&#x27;re still friends and we text each other and we get heated sometimes but we always texture i&#x27;m like love you brother and he&#x27;s like love you too man like you know keep working on the podcast i&#x27;m like i hope you&#x27;re like you know i know your dad&#x27;s sick i hope your dad&#x27;s doing better i&#x27;m i love having people on like that because at the very least the fact that we can agree to disagree to me is amazing the fact that kathy griffin can hold a severed head of trump i&#x27;m like you know what god damn no other nation in the history of the world are you allowed to do that and not be put put against the wall and it&#x27;s terrible and it&#x27;s offensive snoop dogg has a video where he kills donald trump offensive and terrible god damn there is no other nation in the history of the world as progressive as us that would allow you to do that and the reason why i am currently what you would call right even though i don&#x27;t think my position has changed in the last decade and a half is because i want our right to agree to disagree and right now there is one side that doesn&#x27;t want you to agree to disagree say this or you get cancelled ice him shut him up he&#x27;s a nazi he&#x27;s pariah he&#x27;s not allowed to have a job [ __ ] him destroy his property dox him put a mask on scream anti-fascist and beat him with a bike lock [ __ ] that two things one i don&#x27;t think i can say anything else until i feel better now i don&#x27;t think i can say anything else without acknowledging the fact that i think you&#x27;re a very strong person you&#x27;ve been through a whole lot and so yeah i just i give you so much kudos for that and coming out on the other side and for not even being on the other side but like wanting to to be here for a better and higher purpose and to add value to other people to help other people and i think that you&#x27;re going to do that and so like i just i commend you for that two you should watch the hidden agenda i think i&#x27;ve texted it to you like a thousand times but um it&#x27;s a really great documentary and it&#x27;s very boring but it was the guy who actually um and i&#x27;m liking his name to him the worst um he came up with the red pill convention and he&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s the author of jekyll island and it talks about you know the federal reserve and and all of that but he goes into how one political party was infiltrated by the communist party whenever the communist party found out it wasn&#x27;t going to make it as a party of its own you know here in america and so i think it&#x27;s a really great educational um tool kit for you and i&#x27;m gonna keep annoying you about it until you watch it so you just need to go ahead and add that to your list because i do think that there are people who the majority of people who are involved on one side of the aisle or the other are very good and genuine people who want to help their fellow man and one side thinks that it&#x27;s you know with less government and then another side of it is they think is with more government that&#x27;s why i also recommend it to you like a trigger warning killer mic is because if you look at without mentioning political affiliation if you look at the exact issues me and keller mike agree on like almost everything and that isn&#x27;t like it&#x27;s so funny but then he talks about getting government involved and me personally i&#x27;m like well no government doesn&#x27;t necessarily make everything better we need to give more power back to the people um and handle it from that approach but we still want the same yeah and so i i can totally see you know you going from like one side of the aisle to the other i mean would i i couldn&#x27;t vote for obama 2008 i was not old enough in 2012 i couldn&#x27;t vote for obama or romney because i thought that they were both two sides of the wrong point yeah yeah yeah so like i just you know that&#x27;s why i went through a party because i i really try to vote on on principal and you know i did not think that donald trump was gonna be the nominee for the republican party the way i thought the establishment of within the republican party was going to allow that um i thought it was going to be marco rubio i&#x27;m not going to lie to you like that&#x27;s who i thought it was going to be um and when i voted for marco rubio probably not if i&#x27;m gonna be honest um so the fact that donald trump got to where he was from like got to where he is now like from where he was is a big question mark for me i mean we can talk about like kind of how that happened from the from the jump but i totally agree with you in the fact that he kind of came in and said i don&#x27;t care about whatever is going on you know we have to get america back on track and we have to put america first and people can say anything they want to about his personality would i necessarily want to hang out with him probably not um yeah we could be like whatever we want about his own ego and his motivations for what he&#x27;s doing it could be for his own self-interest i actually think that that&#x27;s not even a legitimate argument you can be in for your own self-interest or not because his own self-interests are also still for the betterment of the businessman the majority of the you know economy here in america and so yeah he could be in it for his own selfless interest but he&#x27;s actually helping make the economy better and we&#x27;ve seen nothing but you know like the minorities um and then unemployment has gone down more than any other administration and like i mean he&#x27;s breaking records left to right and not only that he&#x27;s kept a lot of his promises that a lot of other people have not you know i would say like double the amount maybe even triple the amount of promises no new wars i mean holy [ __ ] i mean how low can our bar be but there it is no new awards really disappointing to see that there was not a lot of mainstream coverage on the the peace deal i know that no one thinks that there will ever be peace in the middle east and that could be true that could be true however when is the last administration to actually put forward a document that these countries have signed to where they agree to peace like how long ago was that yeah and you ask yourself that question so there&#x27;s no coverage of that there&#x27;s no coverage of that none like yeah and there&#x27;s this weird it&#x27;s 141 i&#x27;ll keep you for a couple more minutes okay there&#x27;s this weird that you can&#x27;t admit anything he does is good like he&#x27;s not allowed to have one to me that is like a stalemate that at the very get-go like well then we can&#x27;t progress past that if we just everything orange man does is bad like why we could lay off the self tanner a little bit yeah absolutely absolutely no he looks like a [ __ ] [ __ ] like let&#x27;s just he really looks like a [ __ ] dude but yeah actually so before we go on to trump any longer because i really don&#x27;t want to talk about trump that much okay just cause i talk like i just don&#x27;t want to happen yeah yeah yeah yeah okay the election&#x27;s going on see i was just like i feel the worst for melania trump because melania is gorgeous beautiful self-made knows how many different languages five or six different languages has taught her son the same he knows multiple languages and she has stood by his side and they chastise her and demonize her and refuse to give her anything like she doesn&#x27;t get front front page of you know vogue magazine or any of these girly magazines that people like me like to read you know they did that for michelle obama i mean hillary clinton think about like what she actually put up with with bill clinton and you&#x27;ve interviewed um juanita broderick who i am a big fan of and like hillary still stood by his side yeah and media still defended yeah bill murray defending my man that&#x27;s right yeah and he had hillary&#x27;s back on that and then with melania they literally just demonize her and make her look so negative in every angle and she one didn&#x27;t ask for any of this she wasn&#x27;t trying to be in political office unlike hillary clinton that has made it her life mission starting as a republican and then going towards the democratic party and then being married to bill clinton i think just to stick it out so that way she could run for president you know melania is the opposite the antithesis of that and so i just i hate to see her being drunk through the mud over something what has to do with her husband whenever i think she&#x27;s handled herself with grace and dignity and she&#x27;s still out there and she&#x27;s really big on helping children and you know she i just i am such a fan of melania i think that she&#x27;s just a boss yeah and she doesn&#x27;t go out and she doesn&#x27;t say anything negative about anybody she just sticks to herself she does what she stays in her lane she does what she does and i think that she&#x27;s an example that every single woman can look up to because if you&#x27;re a woman working in a professional world you know you&#x27;re gonna have to deal with a lot of a lot of stuff that comes your way yeah you know believe it or not and so like she&#x27;s somebody that i think should be an example over somebody who&#x27;s like a hillary clinton or even kamala harris um so there&#x27;s that yeah it&#x27;s you&#x27;re right is if she was any other party no i agree with you if she was any other party she&#x27;d be painted as like you know the 2020 jacqueline isn&#x27;t she the first immigrant like first lady i don&#x27;t know for sure so i don&#x27;t want to say yes or no yeah i know let&#x27;s just but i mean yeah i mean and then not only that if you can see like attacks on her and you go to any youtube video or any reddit post or any facebook posts they&#x27;re like any comments and it&#x27;s always like this [ __ ] can&#x27;t even like she has like she can barely speak english and it&#x27;s like like how quickly the tables turn right you&#x27;re anti-immigrant and then she&#x27;s like i love like america and they&#x27;re like oh she can&#x27;t even talk and it&#x27;s like jesus christ right and so it makes me very upset how is that not the american dream you taught yourself six languages and you married the president right yep and she was a career she had her own career i mean making that she married donald trump you know and i don&#x27;t know her motivations for that i&#x27;m not going to claim to it could have been for love because of something else however she married who she married yeah and like she&#x27;s sticking by him and she&#x27;s supporting him and i think that she&#x27;s like such a good example of somebody in her position that any little girl should look up to [ __ ] yeah yeah well let&#x27;s wrap it up on that note one friend i think that was a perfect that was a perfect podcast everything from ufos to melania to antarctica which we are going to do uh another episode purely on antarctica and that will be that i call it who are you doing an episode on antarctica with you oh that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m saying i was like no one else no one else is going to have this conversation with me but you are i will happily do that we should both wear like uh that i was gonna say or just like that like like um [ __ ] what we&#x27;re wearing like eskimo jackets you know what i&#x27;m talking about uh parkours parkours they&#x27;re getting my brains frying yeah eskimo jackets yeah we&#x27;ve been talking for a very long time have been thank you for doing it man thank you so much for your help thank you i hope you had fun isn&#x27;t it a blast much fun i
