            <p>Downs in research already put together the research that is going to be done is already specified you don&#x27;t have any choice about it it tells you what you&#x27;re going to do and they&#x27;re done up at the level of you know the advice comes from the level of the National Academy of Sciences and National Science Foundation and so forth but the advice comes from the very Community that&#x27;s trained in U1 in a classical electrodynamics which basically the definity paper was written in 1865 during the time of the Civil War it was modified it actually was curtain to lesser models two times later one by heavy side in the 1880s just after Maxwell was dead and then further his version of the equation which is what is taught today as Maxwell&#x27;s equations were then further symmetrized by symmetrical region by Lin in the 1880s and that&#x27;s what added the Symmetry and threw out all the systems out of symmetry it was an arbitrary decision made by Lin in the 1860s because it made the equations easier you see otherwise the equations are so nonlinear the variables are not separated you&#x27;ve got to use numerical methods you can&#x27;t separate the variables and solve the equations in most cases so it was horrible when you didn&#x27;t have computers today it&#x27;s not that big a problem they problem for an old guy like me but for small for younger guys who go to a good University and get numerical methods in Mathematica and so forth on computers give me a good computer give him a good program okay numerical methods is no problem he can number crunch the computer will do it he doesn&#x27;t have to sit there and painfully to do it like they had to do it back in the 1880s so they did it for a reason but they threw out the baby with the bath water they threw out exactly a whole class of maxwellian system permitted by Nature that are not in equilibrium with their external environment the external environment being precisely the other two components of the super system the active local vacuum and uh the curved SpaceTime see we didn&#x27;t have the the electron hadn&#x27;t even been discovered that the atom hadn&#x27;t been discovered none of this non abalan stuff except maybe as an idle curiosity none of that was even born yet we didn&#x27;t have the models what we had was a problem of trying to understand anything at all about electromagnetics and trying to communicate as heide pointed out with what were then called electricians not electrical engineers and they were about the education of electrician today and uh he said you&#x27;ll never get quaternium across to them that Maxwell wrote his stuff in you got to get it simpler so he chopped it with a broad ax and then when uh Len came in and further symmetry he chopped it again and it only main those systems assumed to be in equilibrium or very near equilibrium with their external environment so we have built a whole class of systems and and procedures and models throughout physics and throughout chemistry and all these other things depending on electromagnetics based on equilibrium conditions and as long as that system restores its equilibrium very rapidly then the present physics model is quite sufficient and the present uh U1 electrodynamics model is quite sufficient and the present chemistry model is quite sufficient when it doesn&#x27;t recover symmetry almost immediately very quickly so that there&#x27;s not much effects at all from uh disequilibrium if it minimizes all its disequilibrium effects the other models are adequate if it does not minimize disequilibrium effect particularly if it stabilizes the disequilibrium structures and the Dynamics then the other models fall apart they are incapable of describing that kind of condition so we&#x27;ve got to go to the models that can handle it and that&#x27;s the higher symmetry electromagnetics which haven&#x27;t been factored into chemistry very much yet either so we&#x27;re we&#x27;re caught in a situation where we&#x27;re using 10 and something year old stuff and it&#x27;s been modified and curtailed there&#x27;s been one hell of a lot of physics discovered since then there&#x27;s been a lot of things discovered in electrodynamics since then so that we could model some of this higher physical phenomena and it hasn&#x27;t been added into the standard uh electrodynamics model and it hasn&#x27;t been added into chemistry that&#x27;s your problem</p>
