            <p>all right everyone hello I am Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos and uh today we were again looking at The Theory of Everything that is called the reciprocal system of theory that is um that was discovered by Dewey B Larson um and uh over the course of the most of the 20th century he died back in 1990 we&#x27;re actually looking at his final book that came out posthumously in 1995. it&#x27;s called beyond space and time and this is Larson&#x27;s attempt to go into metaphysics the religious the philosophical uh the psychological uh whereas most of his earlier books were on uh chemistry and physics and astronomy and heart heart the hard Sciences uh this is a was a departure and some of his adherents would were even embarrassed by it and were angry at his wife for publishing it after he died because they didn&#x27;t think that he would have wanted it to be published be that as it may uh the basic idea of the reciprocal system is that it is a universe of motion the world&#x27;s not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it is made out of motion matter and energy are in fact just kinds of motion as is uh just about all the all of the scientific phenomena out there including um gravity and magnetic flux and capacitance and electric current and electric charge and pressure and um obviously acceleration speed Force these are all forms of motion and uh they are all representative representable um uniquely and exclusively in terms of space and time that&#x27;s because uh the way that Larson defines motion is that motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other hence the reciprocal system uh basically the same as two-thirds and three halves are reciprocals of each other um in motion you have a time component and you have a space component uh you you don&#x27;t you don&#x27;t get time or space without the other they come they come in a package deal just like I was saying with the box if you have a box you have the inside of the box and you have the outside of the box they they come together you don&#x27;t have one without the other and uh you really don&#x27;t have one without all three and um uh so space and time are reciprocals of each other uh therefore they have the same general qualities what we know about space is that it&#x27;s uh three or more dimensions and uh so therefore time is also three or more Dimensions what we know about time is that it&#x27;s flowing and progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and therefore space also has that quality it&#x27;s flowing and progressing always getting farther and farther apart uh which you could see um if you took a balloon and you put a bunch of dots on the balloon with a magic marker and you blew up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that is an analogy of the progression of space Larson calls that clock space uh to uh correspond with clock time and that is what Larson calls a scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no particular direction you can think of it as no direction or all directions and then the three-dimensionality or three or more dimensionality Larson refers to as coordinate space and then also coordinate time now time and space are also similar in that they are in discrete units only there&#x27;s no con continuity of space and time they come in chunks and units of the size of uh of a discrete unit in space is approximately uh 4.5 times 10 to the minus 8 meters and with time it is the incredibly small amount of 1.5 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds that means every second that goes by uh there were approximately 6.6 quadrillion units of time per second so they are so these discrete units are so small that there&#x27;s no way we could you know make them out or resolve them they are so that&#x27;s why everything appears to be smooth but if you really good get down to the uh you know infinitesimal level then uh you will see that they are uh discrete and um you know they build one after another not there are no half units or a third of a unit or three tenths of a unit or anything like that now uh when you have one unit of space in one unit of time now you know that space over time is motion the car is moving space over time is speed I&#x27;m sorry speed um which is a kind of motion but space over time just like the car is moving 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time that is speed well one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light and uh so in Larson&#x27;s Universe the speed of light is the midpoint or the null point or even the origin of the universe whereas in Einstein&#x27;s Universe the speed of light was the maximum speed of the universe so for Larson uh there is an entire universe out there that is moving faster than the speed of light which corresponds with this familiar universe that we have uh that we recognize is moving slower in the than the speed of light the slower than light speed University calls the material sector or sector one this is the realm of uh you know chemistry and physics and then over on the other side the side that&#x27;s faster than the speed of light we have um what Larson calls sector two or the cosmic sector and these are all inverted relationships so this would actually be the realm of inverse matter um inverse chemistry and inverse physics um now uh in sector one matter Grows by aggregation bonding until it gets to its most complex level which is DNA at that point DNA becomes eligible to be controlled overall by uh sector 2 entity and uh that is what Larson calls the life unit life is a combination of material and uh Cosmic entities and then this life unit begins as a single-celled organism and it evolves and develops till it gets to its most complex level which Larson calls the intelligent human being at that point the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector 3 entity now sector three is what Larson refers to as the uh the region that is beyond space and time independent of space and time he calls that metaphysical and uh the metaphysical uh area is also maybe what I would uh think of as the speed of light as the um midpoint and the origin of this universe of these two universes and uh this uh metaphysical region Larson says is always good it&#x27;s always right and it communicates with the intelligent human beings but since the intelligent human beings are basically the equivalent of single-celled uh spiritual organisms they haven&#x27;t quite yet developed most of them anyway haven&#x27;t quite yet developed the tools and the preparation for decoding the messages that we&#x27;re getting from sector three and so at many times those messages are incorrect uh the way that we translate them now that&#x27;s where his his final book is coming in uh beyond space and time it has to do with metaphysical um you know metaphysical processes and and Communications and again a sector three communication is motivating us toward the good or the just or the ethical Behavior whereas sector two is controlling us in terms of survival it&#x27;s motivating us towards survival or animal behavior uh at times those work in harmony at times they work in conflict and that&#x27;s where Free Will comes in so now uh it we are in chapter 24 of this book which is called um outlook for communication I think this is chapter 25 outlook for communication and uh he was just talking about telepathy which is another um sector three communication uh that is um along with you know things like intuition uh religious Revelation ESP uh scientific Insight beatific visions and uh he was noting that uh a key aspect of telepathic communication is that in general the uh the the ones that have been authenticated uh have uh come under conditions of extreme emotional stress and so that&#x27;s where he&#x27;s going to take over right here it is possible that this predominance of highly emotional cases in the records is the result of a selection process experiences that seem to be well outside the limits of plausible explanation as mere coincidences are not at all uncommon but most of these receive little attention they are not even mentioned to anyone or even remembered for any extended period to say nothing of being recorded in any way records of any kind even Recollections are therefore confined to the most spectacular instances the seeming preponderance of highly emotional situations is thus misleading nevertheless the frequent occurrence of telepathic transmission under stress seems to rule out calm and peaceful contemplation as a prerequisite for the sector 3 type of communication it will be necessary however to examine the possibility that the transmitter and the receiver of telepathic met of the telepathic message are subject to different considerations in the communication process previously discussed intuition scientific insight and revelation we have been dealing only with receivers and our finding that quiet concentration is conducive to success in achieving communication applies specifically to reception and not necessarily to transmission experience with the reception of telepathic messages does not contradict this finding as it is or ordinarily the transmitter of the message who is under emotional stress not the receiver at this point then our tentative conclusion is that the circumstances that we have previously found to be favorable for the reception of communications of an intuitive nature applied to the reception of all Communications from sector three but that some special mental or emotional state the nature of which is not yet clear is a requirement for successful transmission of a message through sector 3 channels now remember when a person is under the influence of sector three Larson refers to that as level three so you could have a sector 3 communication between two uh intelligent humans uh it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to come from sector three because sector three kind of uh controls the intelligent human if if uh if the intelligent human allows that to happen and so uh you can&#x27;t have a telepathic communication between two humans and it would still involve sector three okay back to Larson at first glance the second part of this conclusion would seem to be contradicted by the fact that there is another form of sector 3 communication which can take place under a great variety of circumstances in which the transmitter may be anywhere from perfectly calm to highly emotional this is the religious activity known as prayer in secular life a prayer is a petition or Earnest request religious prayers extend over a considerably wider range of attitudes and subject matter but for the purposes of the present discussion their essential characteristic is that they are attempts to communicate with the existence or existences in the metaphysical region this is an activity of vast proportions carried on by hundreds of millions of people in all parts of the earth and over the entire span of recorded history a more extended consideration of this activity indicates that there are some significant differences between prayer and the forms of non-physical communication previously examined that should be taken into account in arriving at our conclusions one point is that while telepathy attempts to communicate with another human being an intuition receives information from sector three prayer attempts to transmit a message to sector 3. we may logically conclude then that prayer has the advantage of dealing with a vastly more sensitive receiver which or who is capable of receiving Communications from less efficient transmitters thus the previous conclusion that the transmitter must be in some special mental or emotional state in order to be successful in sending his message does not have to be discarded it merely needs to be modified to apply only to Communications between human individuals uh we will take a look uh at this later in this chapter it should also be noted that while we know that prayers are being offered under conditions in which the supplicants attitudes range all the way from casual to highly motivated we have little or no evidence as to what effect if any these attitudes may have had on the success of the attempts to communicate indeed we have very little reliable information about the results of prayer and it may be very well that the casual and perfunctory prayers and perhaps the ritualistic prayers are wholly ineffective from a scientific standpoint this and other uncertain aspects of prayer would seem to be subjects that call for a thorough and searching examination as expressed by Weatherhead we have a lot of research to do into the laws which govern intercession back to Larson religious authorities have generally been opposed to anything of this kind ostensibly on the ground that raising questions about or attempting to analyze such intimately religious matters verges on sacrilege we may surprise surmise however that this opposition is also motivated by fear that one of the major questions that would be addressed in such an investigation is whether communication of this nature is possible at all obviously the ecclesiastics must maintain with all of the positiveness at their command dogmatically if one wishes to use that term that such a question cannot be entertained even for a moment since religious Doctrine in its entirety is based on the premise that such communication does take place this objection should not be should not apply in the same degree to the investigation that is now being suggested in this work inasmuch as the findings upon which the study would be based uh definitely confirm the existence of communication with the metaphysical region and hence the question to which the religious authorities are the most sensitive would not come up at all this being true it would seem that science and religion have every reason to make this a common cause and to join forces for a thorough inquiry into the details of the process obviously if anything can be discovered that leads to more effective and efficient communication by the prayer route the primary benefit accrues to religion if anything can be discovered that improves the process of gaining scientific Insight the primary benefit accrues to science but the findings of this work indicate that these two processes are essentially nothing more than different manifestations of the same thing this in turn makes it all together likely that any significant Discovery in either area will be applicable to both of course such cooperation will be impossible if those on the religious side insist that all of their doctrines are infallible and not subject to question for example it will be necessary before any appraisal of the relative effectiveness of different procedures can be undertaken to come to some conclusion as to what kinds of petitions are admissible it will be particularly essential to examine the question as to whether it is in order to request that one or more of the governing laws or principles of the universe be set aside in a particular circumstance this is another sensitive point to be sure since most religions have utilized what they classify as miracles for the purpose of bolstering their case for their particular doctrines and they have encouraged their adherence to ask the ruling powers for concessions which in effect call for miracles or their equivalent no doubt some of the ecclesiastics will be adamant in opposition to any inquiry into this situation but it would seem that by this time a substantial segment of the religious community should be willing to participate in an exploration of this kind particularly since the findings of the present investigation are not adverse to certain classes of Miracles okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there um and we will take over tomorrow in the middle of this chapter 25 where he&#x27;s getting into talking about uh prayer and miracles and uh and how those uh relate to sector three so uh thanks for tuning in and we hope to see you tomorrow uh have a great day</p>
