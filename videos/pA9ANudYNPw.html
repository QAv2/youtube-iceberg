            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>a number of strange happenings have been reported. Everything from sightings of prehistoric beasts and poltergeist activity to shape-shifting monsters and mysterious orbs of light in the sky.</p>
<p>But one detail seems to be consistent: the manner in which these frightening phenomena suddenly come about, as if out of thin air. Could it be that some sort</p>
<p>of portal through space and time really does exist in this area, as many ancient astronaut theorists believe? And while most of Robert Bigelow&#x27;s activities on the property have remained top secret, investigative journalist George Knapp was able to learn of at least one</p>
<p>extraordinary encounter. There was one night, the... one of the most dramatic things that happened, there, two of the scientists-- these are PhD-level people. They walk around</p>
<p>the middle homestead and two guys are up on Skinwalker Ridge looking down. They&#x27;ve got infrared equipment, watching. And one of them with the</p>
<p>infrared sees what looks like a dirty snowball of light just hovering a couple of feet off the ground and he walkie-talkies these guys down there, &quot;Hey, do you see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, we see it, it&#x27;s kind of vague.&quot; Then he says, &quot;Hey, something&#x27;s happening, it&#x27;s changing.&quot; Our guys are on the ridgeline</p>
<p>looking down, and you see a light appear above the ground expand. KNAPP: This ball of light was stretching out.</p>
<p>It became a tunnel of light. Into this tunnel comes a humanoid figure. Some kind of monster reached up, pulled his shoulders and come out.</p>
<p>KNAPP: Seven or eight feet tall, black, featureless. When it gets out, the tunnel collapses into a ball again.</p>
<p>It was almost as if it was a dimensional tunnel, that it was coming from some other reality. NARRATOR: According to both</p>
<p>the Navajo and Ute tribes, such portals do exist. You have to go back to the story of the emergence of the Navajo. The story there is that they went through several underground worlds, and in coming to this world,</p>
<p>through a hole in the ground, or through a portal, if you may. CESSPOOCH: There are holes-- portals, if you want to call them that-- within the universe that allow you to go into different dimensions, and those have existed for eons.</p>
<p>So those who know about them can travel back and forth. REDFERN: Quantum physics, essentially, allows for the existence of multiple dimensions that coexist with ours.</p>
<p>What we&#x27;re seeing at places like the Skinwalker Ranch are strange creatures, unusual entities coming through the portals and the doorways. It&#x27;s entirely possible that creatures and beings from other realms of existence could quite literally jump from</p>
<p>their dimension into our world. More and more, scientists are talking in these extraordinary esoteric terms about very powerful places where realities blend or blur together.</p>
<p>From the descriptions of Skinwalker Ranch, this could well be one of those bleed-over places. NARRATOR: While the theory of a portal</p>
<p>at Skinwalker Ranch may seem incredible, futurist Caroline Cory takes it even one step further. CAROLINE CORY: We know that the physical universe is based on geometry.</p>
<p>We are now predicting that there is a matrix, a grid patterning system around the planet that is a web-like structure with specific entry and exit points that allow certain phenomena to happen that seem supernatural</p>
<p>or paranormal. If there are tears exactly at these locations, you&#x27;re going to have all kinds of anomalies that would happen because of these tears. You&#x27;re going to perhaps,</p>
<p>uh, see an anomaly in the sky or you could also see a prehistoric animal cross over because there&#x27;s a tear in this fabric of space itself. NARRATOR: A tear in the fabric of space? Could it be</p>
<p>that Skinwalker Ranch is not only home to a portal, but some sort of cosmic tear through which entities from other dimensions, other parts of the universe and even other points in time could be entering our world? Local tales and traditions do, in fact, support this theory.</p>
<p>DOVER: A lot of our investigations have found that these things are coming in, uh, through unknown portals. Whether the portals are in the sky or on the ground.</p>
<p>What we&#x27;ve seen from people describing this to us is they hear a loud pop. That the sound actually travels through your body physically, and it jolts you. NARRATOR:</p>
<p>Could there truly be a scientific explanation for the various phenomena at Skinwalker Ranch? One that humans are not yet equipped to fully understand? Maybe a more important question is should we seek to get to the bottom of this mystery at all? Or are we better off just</p>
<p>leaving Skinwalker Ranch alone? There are some who believe that while Skinwalker Ranch is a dangerous place, it may also hold the key to humankind&#x27;s ultimate survival.</p>
