            <p>hello viers in this video we are going to speak about Zer Point Energy accessing of Zer Point Energy and in this video I&#x27;ll explain a Floyd Suite so vacuum tube amplifier not to waste time let&#x27;s get to the drawings and see what I prepared okay now as you can see this is the complete system it&#x27;s it consists of as little components as possible so now we see uh so this wires this uh you can see this brown uh uh these blue and red wires are mounted around a pher pherom magnet yeah so this is the ferit magnet so I&#x27;ll select it now inside is the ferit magnet and around there&#x27;s a threee coil in three in three axis so x x Epsilon and Z yeah so in three axis there is a um wires are wounded around the magnet in three axis so what do we what else do we need to start this system so you can see there are some capacitors here on the image totally six of them but many there is more of them but according to the patent we should apply um 20,000 volts on this inner coil now so this the primary coil should be supplied when with 20,000 volts shortly uh after that or in time with that in parallel we should apply 1 Amper 50 HZ so alternate current so alternate voltage yeah and uh what what will be then uh done to get some output over here on the third coil so with this high amount of voltage yeah from the capacitors and the AC alternate current um through the secondary coil we will get that the ferit uh magnet inside uh creates an resonance so it will resonate on on frequency of this 50 HZ and with the with the uh in this system uh with such approach we should access the Z Point Energy and then we should get an output yeah which will resonate with the same frequency as the input we with this one Amper and after that so in in B based on invention we should get 1 kilow output here and we should only then continuously uh put input of I don&#x27;t know few Watts few mwatts or whats and it should work indefinitely yeah so that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the idea or that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s described by Mr Floy yeah so we are accessing with this uh with this system 0 point energy and you will get continuous output of 1 kilowatt by giving only 50 or 20 M at input with the same frequency so basically if later output will be connected to the input it will be used to continuously Supply the system and this is it uh can this really works who knows but there are many experiments of this also on the Internet available you can read about it but uh real patent was of course not disclosed so there&#x27;s only speculations about that yeah okay so that&#x27;s it yeah that&#x27;s it okay viewers so that was a Floyd vacuum tube amplifier so or popularly called sweet yeah and by getting an energy by accessing the0 Point Energy until next video please stay tuned on my channel</p>
