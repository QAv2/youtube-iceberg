            <p>Minecraft, but I can&#x27;t touch a random color. Okay, we can&#x27;t touch the color green. Are we freaking serious? We&#x27;re completely surrounded by green. That means I can only walk on this for now. Hey guys, every time you like the video, my color changes.</p>
<p>Well, good thing we spawned right next to a village because our only goal is to find a diamond. We just can&#x27;t touch the grass because if I touch it just a little bit, I&#x27;m going to die instantly. Actually, you know what? LET&#x27;S TEST IT OUT. BRO, WHERE&#x27;S the golem? We need to kill him to get some iron. Oh, I see him.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s right there. You know what? I guess we can parkour over. Oh, wait. The color spinning again and we can&#x27;t touch the color yellow. At least I can walk on grass.</p>
<p>This is super helpful. Well, we should probably get some wood and make an ass. We just need Oh my gosh. Why is there so much of these yellow flowers everywhere? There&#x27;s iron golem. Let&#x27;s hit you.</p>
<p>And run, run, run, run, run. And you&#x27;re dead. Let&#x27;s go. Now, let&#x27;s make the iron pickaxe. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Our color is changing again. And we can&#x27;t touch the color brown. Good thing I&#x27;m getting out of the village. We just need to find a cave somewhere. I think I found something.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going down here. Okay, you know what? I&#x27;m just going to mine straight down. Hopefully, we don&#x27;t touch dirt or anything brown on accident. Uh-oh, our color&#x27;s changing again. We can&#x27;t touch the color orange.</p>
<p>Okay, that&#x27;s not too bad. I mean, what&#x27;s orange in Minecraft? Oh, good thing our color changed. That was way too close. Come on, bro. Get me in a cave, please.</p>
<p>No. No. No. No. Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I&#x27;m going to die. I&#x27;m going to die. to the diamond.</p>
