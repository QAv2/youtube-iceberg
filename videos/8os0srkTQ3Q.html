            <p>foreign [Music] Rife and his frequency machine firstly before we begin let&#x27;s understand resonance [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] Dr Royal Raymond Rife and his frequency machine between 1926 to 1933 Dr Rife worked on developing his Rife frequency machine that utilized resonant light and Crystal frequencies to penetrate the body and Destroy pathogens Dr Rife worked on the premise that every pathogen has a resonant energy and when we introduce a matching Resonance of a particular pathogen you can devitalize and neutralize that problem resonance is similar to how an opera singer can shatter a crystal glass with their voice there is a 313 page report plus videos available in the information below if you&#x27;d like to dig deeper also the 1987 book by Barry Linz the cancer cure that worked 50 years of suppression delves deep the universal microscope developed in 1933 consists of 5682 parts and is so called because of its adaptability in all fields of microscopical work being fully equipped with separate substage condenser units for transmitted and monochromatic beam dark field polarized and slit Ultra illumination including also a special device for crystallography the entire Optical system of lenses and prisons as well as the illuminating units are made of block crystal quartz quartz being especially transparent to ultraviolet radiations a monochromatic beam of light corresponding exactly to the frequency of the organism is then sent up through the specimen and of the direct transmitted light thus enabling The Observer to view the organism stained in its true chemical color and revealing its own individual structure in a field which is brilliant with light the Rays of light refracted by the specimen enter the objective and are then carried up the tube in parallel rays through the 21 Light bends to the ocular a tolerance of less than one wavelength of visible light only being permitted in the core beam under the universal microscope disease organisms such as those of tuberculosis cancer sarcoma streptococcus typhoid staphylococcus leprosy hoof and mouth disease and others may be observed to succumb when exposed to certain lethal frequencies coordinated with the particular frequencies peculiar to each into individual organism and directed upon them by the Rays covering a wide range of ways now directly above reich&#x27;s head is the ray tube which will be turned on later to kill the virus the black instrument to the left of Reich is the ray tube instrument and consists of a transmitter on which Rife could tune the frequencies which he knew would kill the virus just like an opera singer&#x27;s voice can shatter glass looking through the microscope as he applied various frequencies that he was able to kill these microorganisms proving his theory to be correct in order to determine which frequencies would kill a particular organism it was absolutely essential that he be able to see the organisms in a living state so that he could observe the effect of various frequencies in real time life later called a frequency which killed an organism it&#x27;s m-o-r or Mortal oscillatory rate in 1931 Dr Milbank Johnson invited 44 prominent scientists and doctors to a dinner at his residence the end to all disease dinner was in Royal rife&#x27;s honor and a photograph was featured in newspapers at the time meanwhile Morris fishbein was the sole stockholder and president of the American Medical Association AMA and a journalist for the AMA Journal of Medicine fishbein along with drug companies put pressure on all licensed doctors to ignore rife&#x27;s machine under threat of losing their license and livelihood the 44 doctors who attended Johnson&#x27;s dinner denied ever meeting Rife a few years later Dr Milbank Johnson was about to announce to newspapers about the success of rife&#x27;s machine in a 1934 study involving 16 cancer patients who were all cured using rife&#x27;s machine however Dr Johnson was fatally poisoned and died just hours before making his announcement fishbein tried unsuccessfully to buy the rights to rife&#x27;s machine eventually fishbein funded a court case against Rife and Rife turned to alcohol which didn&#x27;t end well in rife&#x27;s own words having spent every dime I earned in my research for the benefit of mankind I have ended up as a pauper but I achieved The Impossible and would do it again in 1931 rife&#x27;s frequency machine cost two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to build around five million dollars in today&#x27;s money foreign [Music] [Music]</p>
