            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel focused on uh getting you up to speed on some of the great theories of everything that are out there that I&#x27;ve uncovered uh usually accidentally uh in my uh years of research and uh today is video number 35 57 on dwey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory Larson lived back in the 20th century and around 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates and uh after that he took his two postulates and um you know kind of uh went through a process of deduction and came up with a theoretical Universe of how the universe would look if his two postulates were correct and um then he spent some time writing books and more or less comparing uh his theoretical Universe with the uh Universe At Large uh that was observed D and hypothesized by Legacy science and um very interesting study uh Larson died back in 1990 um leaving behind a dozen or so books maybe a little bit more than that I don&#x27;t haven&#x27;t counted about 50 articles a lot of talks a lot of um you know other ephemera and uh handful of an organization a journal and a handful of other researchers who were Keen to um put their contributions in on the reciprocal system and we&#x27;re going to be talking uh hearing from one of those people today Dr Bruce pet who came up with this thing called rs2 reciprocal system 2 along with Dr kvk neru and uh that is the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system he has about nine articles here that are called rs2 101 102 103 we&#x27;re on number 107 today which is called mass and gravity and so we&#x27;re going to look into uh Dr Pet&#x27;s evaluation of uh at least mass and gravity in terms of the reciprocal system now the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe that is made out of motion and um it&#x27;s not made out of matter not made out of energy it&#x27;s not even uh made out of any fundamental forces but is made out in fact all three of those things are merely different varieties of motion as our all of our scientific qual uh quantities are a um expressions of motion and can be um expressed exclusively in terms of space and time because that is how Larson defines motion motion is the relationship between space and time motion for LaRon is basically a fraction with time or space as the numerator space or time as the denominator uh such as speed uh speed is space over time the bicycle is moving t miles hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time and you can see the reciprocal relationship between space and time there in Speed uh say if you want to double the speed if you double the speed you can then you can say the bicycle is moving 20 miles per hour you&#x27;re doubling the space and keeping the time the same but you can also say that the bicycle is moving 10 miles per half hour so you can half the um the time it&#x27;s the same as uh doubling the space there is a reciprocal relationship between time and space that&#x27;s why lson calls it the reciprocal system of theory because of this um reciprocal relationship between time and space in motion time and space are reciprocals of each other and as a result uh just like all other reciprocals they have the same uh symmetrical qualities um what we know best about space is that it is is threedimensional XYZ coordinates I will just say multi-dimensional I think it also can be four-dimensional uh but uh Larson uh goes with three-dimensional XYZ coordinates and as a result time is also three-dimensional and Larson refers to this as coordinate time coord coordinate space and coordinate time then also um time and space both progress Larson refers to this as clock time and clock space now this progression is uh important because this is the mo this is the fundamental motion that the universe is made out of the coordinate time and coordinate space is somewhat of a uh an illusion that has to do with really being in a gravitational field uh it appears uh when you have this coordinate time or coordinate space you are uh you have stationary space or stationary time but in a universe of motion the uh the real aspect is the progression of of space and the progression of time clock space and clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later and later and in space that means that space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in both cases uh neither space nor time is moving in any particular direction uh this is what uh is known as scalar motion uh lson calls it scalar motion and it scalar motion is a kind of motion that has been noticed and documented by other researchers but they have never really seen scalar motion to be of any importance and have never given it any type of centrality to their theories on like Larson now a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction the clock is always getting later and later and later but it&#x27;s not getting later in any specific Direction and um time is clock uh the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart also not getting farther apart in any particular direction you can Envision this using a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other and that is um a scaler motion um the farther away the dots are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other and um you are not able to actually notice any type of direction or specific Direction each dot is moving away from each other Dot and in fact the spaces between the dots are also moving away from uh the other dots and the other spaces between the dots all points on the balloon all locations on the balloon are moving away from each other so it&#x27;s uh no specific direction of really every direction the only way that you get any type of Direction ality out of this is when you arbitrarily decide that one of the dots or one of the locations is motionless when you arbitrary that would be what you would call a reference point when you arbitrarily decide that one of these points is motionless then you can start to uh determine directions to to the other dots uh now this was also recognized uh by the astronomers looking through their telescopes noticed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other but still they didn&#x27;t recognized this was a significant kind of motion instead they decided that this was uh the argument for the Big Bang and that the Big Bang meant that um at one point in a time all of these different dots all these different galaxies were located in a singularity all jammed together and then that whole thing blew up and that&#x27;s why all the all the galaxies are moving away from each other because uh they are the product of this huge bang that occurred uh 13 billion years ago or whatever it is and uh so that is um jumping to conclusions um but this is actually a scalar motion and it is a product of a universe of motion and um now the other other part that Larsson includes in his first postulate about space and time is that they both come in discreet units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time uh if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space or time then you don&#x27;t have any space or time you have to have a full unit and if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light space over time is speed one unit of space and one unit of time is the speed of light Larson ref refers to this as unit speed 1/ 1al 1 this is the place where space equals time they both equal one and um this is really what lson refers to as the null point or the state of rest or the zero point or the origin uh The Ether um of this universe of motion is the speed of light moving outward in all directions in both space and time and Larson refers to this as the progression of the natural reference system so this progressing is kind of the nature of this universe this contrasts sharply with the Legacy scientists who say that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and that nothing can go faster than the speed of light Larson is saying that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe the neutral point and that half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light which he refers to as the cosmic sector and that there&#x27;s half of the universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light the material sector and the material sector is really the only sector that uh the Legacy scientists know about and they that&#x27;s where they make their measurements that&#x27;s where we all make our measurements that&#x27;s where we reside and that&#x27;s um but because of the reciprocal relationship between space and time we can determine what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector all we have to do is invert the role RS of space and time so in the material sector we&#x27;re accustomed to the idea of coordinate space three dimensions of space stationary space and clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later in the cosmic sector once we cross that unit speed boundary we move into the cosmic sector and observe coordinate time 3 dimensions of stationary time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart like on the surface of an expanding balloon so that is um how that reciprocity works out and now there uh there&#x27;s a second postulate also which basically says that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its uh primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian this uh this prostate has been uh actually rejected by Dr Bruce pet for one not entirely rejected he gets rid of the idea of the commutative mathematics he gets rid of the idea of the primary magnitudes and he gets rid of the idea of the ukian geometry to replace it with projective geometry which is a kind of geometry that includes a ukian geometry okay now let&#x27;s start up with uh Dr Pet&#x27;s uh paper here now we went through the beginning of this paper yesterday so this is the second installment so if you want to get uh go from the start go back to yesterday&#x27;s episode and listen to the you know the second half of uh the episode okay this section is called gravity of the situation as we know space and time are reciprocals of each other in the reciprocal system everything has its reciprocal which also includes Direction velocity and geometry Inward and outward motion are reciprocals as are linear and angular velocities and points and volumes so this is uh something that per uh that Larson didn&#x27;t really get into uh the reciprocity especially the geometrical reciprocity um and also the um linear and angular velocities being also reciprocals of one another so we have mass defined as an outward angular velocity in time defining a volume let&#x27;s take a complete reciprocal of mass and see what we have as a natural Consequence the aspect of time becomes space outward motion becomes inward motion angular or circumferential velocity basically like rotation becomes linear or radial velocity uh which is like the radius of the circle so you know you have the radius and you have the circumference the radial motion is linear the circumferential motion is angular or circular I suppose it might also be elliptical I&#x27;m not sure about that okay volume becomes a point location these are the reciprocities volume and uh a point three-dimensional and Zero Dimensional the reciprocal of mass is therefore an inward linear velocity in space that can be expressed through a single point that is the definition of gravity an inward linear velocity in space that can be expressed through a single point definition of gravity where the point is the center of gravity mass and gravity are the same thing from inverse perspectives um yeah I I have trouble with that concept um that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong it just means that I&#x27;m slow to grasp that um but uh because I I I am under the impression that gravity is like the sucking in of the balloon when you uh move the you know if you have the balloon with dots on it you blow it up and all the points move away from each other that&#x27;s what you call the progression but when you take the balloon and you suck in the balloon and uh all the points start moving toward each other that&#x27;s what I thought was gravity and that doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with reference point you still need to have a reference point before you can have any type of center of gravity so I&#x27;m a little bit lost about that okay so this section is called massless particles all material motions have a rotation in time and therefore all material motions particles and atoms must have mass the problem with massless particles lies in the way we indirectly measure mass through the measurable gravitational pull in space not unmeasurable angular velocity in time and that brings up another reciprocal relation that of the inverse relationship between step measure how we measure things in a straight line and growth measure which is how we measure angles step measure is the conventional method of measuring finite quantities just like pacing off steps to measure distance this is associated with the first unit of motion speed with the range of um 0 to one coordinate time can also be step measured but unfortunately our mechanics and Technology only allow us to measure space not time we can only see space not time so temporal measurements must be made by their projection into equivalent space as an angular change or growth measure growth measure is is associated with the second unit of motion energy uh with the range of one to Infinity so as far as I know this is really talking about like a cosmic sector kind of thing this is you know um the mass or the um speed aspect goes from zero to one one being the boundary the unit speed boundary and then energy goes from one to Infinity the um greater than one but I could be wrong about that so let&#x27;s keep going since we cannot do a finite count to Infinity growth measure is done with the calculus concept of infinitesimals the integral to transform this growth measure in equivalent space to a step measure in linear space the natural logarithm must must be used as um uh the log of um delta T the consequence of this is um that the magnitude of gravity appears as a logarithmic curve whereas the magnitude of mass is linear the reciprocal system works with discrete units Quant so until the magnitude of a temporal rotation becomes Mass no uh until the magnitude of a temporal rotation Mass becomes high enough to produce a single unit of inward spatial magnitude gravity does not exist in space yeah okay and that occurs with a net temporal speed of three displac of three displacement units since the log of three uh is greater than one if you have a log of two that&#x27;s less than one and the log of one is zero so you have to have a full three units before your log is one or greater enough for a um discrete unit of space of time so any rotating system that has a net displacement of zero one or two will have no effect as gravity in space giving them the appearance of being massless specifically the massless particles are photons positrons electrons and neutrinos the proton is the first particle with mass having a temporal displacement of three units two for the proton plus one for the rot rotational base the electron volt masses that are associated with these massless particles are an attempt to determine the actual rotational speeds of the particles rather than inferring it from their gravitational influence okay that&#x27;s the end of that section we will uh stop it off there and move into this next section uh tomorrow which is called uh particles moving at the speed of light so we&#x27;re going to look at uh some more about these massless particles the basic idea I think is just that uh in larsson&#x27;s notation you know atoms and particles are um rotational motions uh and um they come in three different um you can have a two-dimensional primary rotation a two-dimensional secondary rotation and a one-dimensional rotation and uh you need to have a total of three of those um well actually two uh plus the rotational base in order to create Mass because Mass requires a discrete unit and um he talked about a lot of other stuff there sometimes pet overloads you with Concepts and sometimes he doesn&#x27;t um flesh those out particularly well uh I&#x27;m not sure why he even got into talking about these inverses the inverse of of volume is a point and the inverse of a um or the reciprocal of of um velocity and the reciprocal of linear velocity is angular velocity um and uh it can be a little bit overwhelming and confusing again my advice is just to let it wash over you and uh you know take what you need leave the rest but leave it in your head so that you might be able to get it later and don&#x27;t reject anything out of hand uh let uh give Larson the opportunity or give the reciprocal system the opportunity to um State their case um and the case cannot be stated in like one episode of this you need to have a holistic picture of the reciprocal system which requires um you know a number of different different repetitions um the the reciprocal system is very multifaceted and it go it goes into every subject and so if you just kind of learn one subject you&#x27;re not getting the full picture it&#x27;s it&#x27;s much more powerful to understand that the reciprocal system uses the same rules regardless of the subject and so it&#x27;s using the same equations uh in many cases um if you&#x27;re looking at Atomic physics or if you&#x27;re looking at astrophysics um you know it uses the same basic equations and the same Concepts to deal with atoms as it does dealing with G galaxies and so it&#x27;s powerful to see the consistency involved whereas Legacy science is using fragments you know they have one Theory for the atom and they have another theory for um you know um macro things and then an entirely other theory for astronomical things but Larson is using the same concepts for everything and so you have to kind of stick with it until you see the whole picture okay uh thanks for tuning in today we&#x27;ll be back tomorrow to to uh continue this article on mass and gravity</p>
