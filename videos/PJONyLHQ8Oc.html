            <p>okay and everyone glenn tony robertson has over 40 years of experience in propulsion holds 10 patents and has published over 20 papers on propulsion and power generation he&#x27;s also chaired numerous professional and technical conferences and played an important role in emerging and alternative propulsion research tony was also a key figure in nasa&#x27;s experimental replication attempt of the poglanov rotating superconductive gravity shield experiment and more recently he&#x27;s been a regular attendee and presenter at the apec conference tony is far too humble to call himself a legend so i will do it for him everyone let&#x27;s please welcome tony robertson and let me hand it over to you sir okay you guys want to know about the uh slipknot experiment that we did at nasa but i want to give you a first a history of it ning lee uh wrote wrote that paper uh when she was at the university of alabama in huntsville she apparently met the center director marshall space flight center who probably invited her to come talk to him which she did and she got sent down to uh the primary design office to try to get funding and ended up in uh whit brantley&#x27;s office who eventually ended up being my boss there in preliminary design and he called me up and so we got together with ning lee and decided to do a a center director&#x27;s discretionary fund to do an experiment that she proposed and what she came to the experiment she came to nasa to propose was actually to spin a superconductor about this size it&#x27;s about three inches high about an inch in diameter with about a half inch hole up to about 35 000 rpm and uh the the we we thought the speed was too high so we focused the uh center discretionary fund on the spinning device for that uh and so the first so in 1996 we spent about a year making some of these and uh looking into doing a magnetic uh levitation spinning thing and stuff and then at the end of the year when we went to propose for a second year of funding uh we found out about the clinton off experiment and so we discussed it and decided that that might be a better experiment to do since he was only spending it at about 5000 rpm instead of 35 000 rpm that uh he suggested but what i want to point out was this device the supernatural she wanted to rotate is actually an experiment that was proposed by rocker can y&#x27;all see my screen hey tim can y&#x27;all see my screen let me share a screen here there we go can you all see this screen i don&#x27;t hear anybody well anyway robert becker the master of science thesis uh actually proposed the experiment that ningley came to marshall for uh and uh so she actually wasn&#x27;t her experiment with somebody else&#x27;s experiment um guys if nobody doesn&#x27;t talk to me i don&#x27;t know if i even you guys can even hear me but uh we went on to to to do the clinton off experiment and set up this experiment because of the solar speed and spend about a half a year doing that and then our management decided to turn it over to the science directorate and when they went to the science directorate they brought in [Music] a group of people from the science directorate and uh this is the team that was formed from the science directorate this is me this is ning lee ron kozar was put in charge of the team mrs whit brantley my boss at the time this is the big super like this we we we we had built to to do this 11 or 12 inch disc uh there&#x27;s a paper that was put together that discusses some of the stuff we were doing at the time uh but um the but we never really did much of anything once this team was formed there was really no organization there was no accountability for what we&#x27;re doing whatsoever ningley was charged with building the superconductor but she never gave us the superconductor she built to even determine if they were viable for doing an experiment uh ron kozar was off doing his own thing of making large superconductors too i was doing off on my own thing doing some superior we all had different other jobs to do so it was really just disorganized uh david novar did a few things in fact there&#x27;s another second paper with nova and uh and um cozar on it that talks about the gravadometer which really was useless to be honest with you um but in the long run we never we built we we pressed superconductors gave them to ning lee she supposedly fired him up i did go to her lab once and saw some of the ones she fired but most of them looked like they were partially in what they call the green phase which is non-superconductive so as far as i know no big superconductor was ever made by ningli that was viable to do an experiment and she never just wanted to prove that so we don&#x27;t know whatever so the program ended basically in failure because of the disarray of the whole program after uh the science director took over uh and then so that ended in about uh either 90 in the 97 or in the 98 well ron kozar was able to get an sbr who uh through a company to relook at it and they spent several years looking looking at it and they had hired pcletnov to help them design the discs and make the discs it did make the disc but they&#x27;re they my opinion wasted a lot of money because once you give money to an sbr contractor they can do anything they want to with it basically they bought a doer for like sixty thousand dollars that was totally useless for the program uh they spent a lot of money on the clinton off and and and because basically use that data to put in his other papers on the impulse experiments that come with conductor data that&#x27;s in there is actually the data that the sbr people actually did did but but they ended up failing too they ended up making a disk they gave us a dis they gave us the dual magnets on it showed that it would levitate but then the program died and nothing happened so basically nasa paid two programs about the same amount of money and they got to the same spot and it never got finished no hey tim can y&#x27;all hear me oh yeah yeah now i can hear you fine yeah i&#x27;m just hearing myself here so i don&#x27;t know what if i&#x27;m talking to anybody or not oh no yeah we&#x27;re we&#x27;re all here we&#x27;re just listening you know i really appreciate sharing this history with us also i mean because this is you know i think it&#x27;s incredibly valuable to have just better understanding of what nasa attempted and and all that and the other thing that people keep saying that that ningli is probably in some secret laboratory and can you see this picture that i get up um it&#x27;s still showing the nasa superconductor gravity team yeah well i&#x27;m you know i&#x27;m on the left side and english on the right side i&#x27;m about 40 years old in this picture and she&#x27;s at least 10 to 15 years old older than i am i&#x27;m 67 now so so she&#x27;s you know around 80 years old right now so if she&#x27;s in some secret lab doing any experiments uh she&#x27;s crawling around i don&#x27;t know what her cane is but so i don&#x27;t believe that she&#x27;s off doing any secret stuff i i ran across a guy about uh about four years ago who said that he had met ningli two years prior to that here in huntsville so at least six years ago or so she was still here in huntsville doing something but uh as far as i know after 2000 something early 2000s i never heard anything more about what she was doing i know she got sick and went back to china for a year or so and came back and i met her after she came back uh we talked a little bit but she was she said she wasn&#x27;t doing anything at that time you know tony if i could interject for just a second i was going to wait on this for later because i think it was jeremy or mark that had told me but um so they had just found an obituary from dr ningli um and and if you want here let me let me stop your uh let me stop your screen share really quick okay and i will let me bring this up and then i&#x27;ll do a screen share on this okay and hope hopefully you guys can see that um so yeah unfortunately what it&#x27;s saying is dr ningli of huntsville alabama passed peacefully on july 27th at 79 years old she was one of the world&#x27;s leading scientists in superconductivity anti-gravity she constructed the first 12-inch htsd in the late 90s and then it said that she&#x27;s survived by her son her grandchildren and let me see they have a plan for a celebration of life and that was back so she passed on july 27th the celebration of life was on august 1st so unfortunately it looks like she&#x27;s passed and that that&#x27;s a tragedy because um you know she she definitely was she had recognized expertise and of course we would have loved to have her on apec as well so let me stop sharing there but yeah my guess about her age was about right she&#x27;s 79 she&#x27;s almost 80. uh but ning lay uh was a odd character to work with uh she she at some point in time she would run to management and and tell them to fire somebody on the team including myself because she would disagree with us or something uh so i don&#x27;t want to disrespect someone somebody but she wasn&#x27;t the angel that everybody thinks she was as far as it goes and um so but if anybody wants to know anymore i&#x27;ve got some of my paperwork for from the center discretionary funds and the sbr but i didn&#x27;t want to share them on the video because i&#x27;m not even don&#x27;t even know if i&#x27;m supposed to even still have them supposed to kind of turn all that stuff into nasa when you uh retire and everything so</p>
