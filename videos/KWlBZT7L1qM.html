            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Big thank you to Nebula for sponsoring this video. [Music] &gt;&gt;Narrator: On the 22nd of July 2023 a preprint  of a physics paper appeared online. It will be   all anyone can talk about for the next month.  It concerns a material called LK-99.</p>
<p>A room   temperature superconductor. Superconductors  were first found in the early 1900s. They’re   remarkable because they have almost zero  electrical resistance when brought down   to frigid temperatures, often close to absolute </p>
<p>zero. And then in 1986 something amazing happened.   Physicists had stumbled onto materials with  critical temperatures as high as 77 Kelvin,   a temp we can reach with liquid nitrogen. It was  a complete upending of the scientific status quo.   In one of the fastest turnarounds in the field’s </p>
<p>history, the discoverers won the Nobel Prize the   very next year. Since then, the path forward  has been obvious. Keep raising the temperature.   Find one that can operate at room temperature.  Without the limitation of cryogenic coolers,   maglev trains could go further, MRI machines would </p>
<p>be cheaper, and even our power grids might be 20%   more efficient. Maybe one day we could end our  dependence on oil and gas. It would fundamentally   change the entire way we lived. And we’ve been </p>
<p>searching for that holy grail for decades. That’s why LK-99 took the world by storm. For  a brief moment, people wanted to believe in   something. LK-99 wasn’t particularly </p>
<p>exotic. A mixture of copper, lead,   phosphorus and oxygen with a hexagonal crystal  shape. It looks like a hunk of unremarkable   grey metal. Two of the paper’s authors, Lee and </p>
<p>Kim, said they’d been working on it since 1999,   hence the name. This made for a great  underdog story. If real, it would almost   guarantee Korea its first ever Nobel prize, a  goal the country had been chasing for decades.</p>
<p>Because it was made of relatively cheap and  easy to find materials the barrier for entry   was super low. It was so accessible in fact, that  everyone from huge national labs to hobbyists in   their basements were cranking out experiments.  Science is most often done out of the public eye,   mostly because it’s difficult, but also because </p>
<p>it’s generally very boring. But with LK-99 this   was something different. Amateurs were  documenting their progress on Twitter.   Reddit threads tracked updates  with meticulous detail.</p>
<p>LK-99 was   a spectator sport because it felt like  history was being made in real time. Part of what really captured people’s imagination  was the videos. The Korean team had shown a piece   of LK-99, about the size of a coin, levitating </p>
<p>in a magnetic field. This was a showcase of the   Meissner effect, one of the two main properties  of a superconductor. Soon, several more videos of   levitating scraps began to appear on twitter,  each one being viewed as further evidence of   confirmation.</p>
<p>On Bilibili, a Chinese social  media app, one levitation video became the most   viewed video of August 1st. The reaction from  many was that there is clearly something here,   it doesn’t take fancy equipment to tell  you what you can see with your own eyes.</p>
<p>With the cryptocurrency market crashing in 2023,  many speculative investors turned their attention   to LK-99 as the next big thing. Korean and Chinese  tech stocks surged for two weeks before returning   to normal in early August. Scams, hype and </p>
<p>misinformation flourished. Fan fiction about   the authors was being published on Twitter  but shared without people realizing it was   completely fake. The language barrier made  it even harder to verify fact from fiction.</p>
<p>But many scientists, from the beginning, had been  skeptical. This was not their first rodeo. They’d   lived through Hendrik Schon, and Ranga Dias  had a paper retracted just the year before.   Everyone and their kitchen sink had claimed </p>
<p>a room temperature superconductor before,   and it was unclear why this one  would be any different. First of all,   the paper hadn’t even been peer reviewed, it was  just a preprint. And second of all, levitation   is not exclusive to superconductivity.</p>
<p>Plenty  of magnetic materials levitate for a variety of   less interesting reasons. And thirdly, no one  had provided the data that actually mattered,   the resistivity. Unless it reliably went to </p>
<p>zero, there was plenty of room for error. The   skepticism was met with pushback. Open minds are  how paradigms are upended. Let’s wait and see.</p>
<p>But as the weeks wore on, the tide quickly  began to change. At least 15 labs found they   couldn’t replicate the effect. A paper  published in Nature on August 16th was   considered by many the definitive final </p>
<p>word. LK-99 isn’t a superconductor. It   is an insulator. Any effect that looked like  superconductivity was inconsistent at best,   and due to impurities in the samples, which arise </p>
<p>due to contamination in the fabrication process.   These effects are not superconductivity, but  rather small instances of regular magnetism.   There was no obvious evidence of fraud, no data  that was knowingly manipulated. They just got   it wrong. None of this controversy needed </p>
<p>to happen, and it can all be traced back   to one key reason. Because the team went public  before their paper was properly peer reviewed. Both Kim and Lee said that the initial paper  was posted online without their permission by   another author.</p>
<p>Lee called it incomplete,  and Kim admitted it was full of flaws. As   for why that author rushed to go public,  the reasons are unclear, but some signs   point to a fear of leaks. But it is clear that </p>
<p>they thought they had something truly real. Even though much of the world stopped  paying attention in August of 2023,   some true diehards persisted. The original Korean  group told anyone still listening that future   papers would fix the issues.</p>
<p>And throughout  2024, groups in Japan and China insist that   they are on the verge of a breakthrough. At the  time of writing it is a little more than a year   since LK-99 had its 15 minutes in the spotlight.  There is something powerful about its promise that   allows it to persist in people’s minds.</p>
<p>They  put aside their usual skepticism because the   potential payoff is so big. Like betting on  the lottery. You know the odds aren’t great.   Astronomical even.</p>
<p>But if it ever paid off  it would change the world. So why not keep   trying. What’s a couple extra months? What’s  one year? What’s two? The longer you keep at it,   the lonelier it gets.</p>
<p>Every day you keep going  your peers lose a little respect for you,   and you may even pass a point where your  credibility is permanently stained. By then,   why not go all the way? You just have to  keep hoping that it will all be worth it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Without some morals, or something to  believe in on this planet, be it god,   or science, or whatever you truly believe  in. And what do you have? What do you have?   What do you have—what reason do you have to  survive? What reason do you have to go on? &gt;&gt; “He that doeth nothing is damned, </p>
<p>and I don&#x27;t want to be damned.” [Music] For the majority of the world, Baltimore  1989 is where cold fusion died. It was so   thoroughly eviscerated, alongside the  credibility of Pons and Fleischmann,   that anyone with just a passing interest gave up  on the dream.</p>
<p>It became just another entry in a   long list of scientific inventions that turned out  to be nonsense. Polywater, N-rays, turning lead   into gold. Shorthand for the impossible. But ideas </p>
<p>are nearly impossible to kill entirely. If it’s   tantalizing enough, there will always be champions  for it. And so began the long, long, summer. If you were in the room itself, cheering </p>
<p>alongside 2000 others to Nathan Lewis’ talk,   you might have been compelled to call cold  fusion dead then and there. But those who   weren’t in Baltimore that day were not  as easily swayed. Dozens of other labs   had reported positive results.</p>
<p>They were also  seeing heat, neutrons, tritium, or some mix   of the three. Many were still on the fence,  and the overwhelmingly negative atmosphere in   Baltimore felt like a witch hunt to some.  A level of skepticism that was crossing the   line into prejudice.</p>
<p>A refusal to even consider  that there may be something new going on here. &gt;&gt; People who have been unable to reproduce  the experiment are not doing it correctly. &gt;&gt; Lewis’ talk had been recorded, but many </p>
<p>scientists were not able to watch it for   themselves, and only heard of it secondhand  from colleagues. Some argued that Lewis had   done what he so many others criticized Pons  and Fleischmann of, going public before they   had a peer reviewed paper. But Lewis and </p>
<p>his group were aware of this criticism,   and so they did what Pons and Fleischmann did  not. They opened themselves up to questions.   Lewis was personally on the phone for  hours each day, speaking to those who   wanted answers. His group sent over their </p>
<p>data and calculations via fax machine to   anyone who wanted them. And in several cases,  his team called up labs with positive results   and pointed out errors in their experiments that  eventually led to retractions. And this is why   ultimately many groups came over to Lewis’ </p>
<p>side. Pons and Fleischmann had spent months   refusing to divulge key information despite  asking for millions of dollars in taxpayer money,   and on the rare occasions they did respond to  questions, they often contradicted past answers. In Dallas, cold fusion’s advocates </p>
<p>were on top of the world. In Baltimore,   its critics struck a near fatal blow.  But you could argue that in both cases,   those were echo chambers. The true decisive  battle would require a confrontation of both   sides.</p>
<p>And that would take place in Los  Angeles on May 8th. This was a special   session of the Electrochemistry Society.  This is the definition of home turf for   Pons and Fleischmann. It’s not just chemistry, </p>
<p>it’s electrochemistry, their exact subfield. &gt;&gt; We visited the Colosseum where  the Christians you know were   fed to the lions. I mean the parallel has occurred to me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Narrator: They’ll be surrounded by allies, in a  smaller arena of just 1600. And the organizers had   made a point of stacking the list of speakers  with only those who reported positive results.   However, as soon as news of this became public  the organizers received massive backlash,   and agreed to accept negative papers too. </p>
<p>The conference itself took place without   much friction. But it was the press  conference that took place after that   caused a PR nightmare. Hugo Rossi, dean  of science at U of U called LA, quote:   “the end of innocence.” After enjoying </p>
<p>an amicable relationship with the press   for over a month, you can tell from the very  first question that the vibes have shifted. &gt;&gt;Reporter: Dr Fleischmann, I was one of the  few reporters that paid the 200 to get in there,   and I think on behalf of the press we&#x27;d like to  object that the session was not open to regular   press coverage.</p>
<p>Are you willing to acknowledge  any possibility at all that your observations   are wrong and you did not have fusion, or  are you completely convinced you had fusion? &gt;&gt; I have always been ready  to acknowledge the fact that   our experiments may be faulty. If we turn</p>
<p>out to be wrong I&#x27;ll be the first to admit it. &gt;&gt; Narrator: Fleischmann shows visible frustration  here. Pons and Fleischmann had done a major pivot   since Baltimore, the lack of neutrons wasn’t bad  news, it was actually good news.</p>
<p>Why? Of the three   radiation branches, they were focusing on the  wrong ones. They shouldn’t actually be seeing   neutrons or tritium, they should be seeing helium.  Here’s the big issue though, the third branch does   not occur nearly as often as the first or second.  Whereas those two occur roughly 50/50, the third   branch is just a fraction of a percent.</p>
<p>You could  make the argument that something about doing it at   room temperature might change these percentages,  but there was no solid evidence to back this up.   In fact, muon catalyzed fusion, which can and  does often occur at room temperature, shows   no significant change in its branching ratios.  And there’s another thing, this branch should   give off gamma rays at 23.8 MeV.</p>
<p>And since they  weren’t seeing those gamma rays, they argued that   those rays are being absorbed by the palladium  lattice. A convenient explanation. But again,   even this would have some visible evidence. </p>
<p>High energy electrons whizzing through water   causes Cherenkov radiation which has a distinct  blue glow, which should be visible to the naked   eye. When asked if they had seen this, Pons said  quote: “To tell you the truth, we haven’t even   looked for it. We’ve turned off the lights in </p>
<p>the laboratory and haven’t seen anything, but   it’s not that dark.” Helium tends to stay embedded  within palladium, and so two labs present at the   conference, MIT and Sandia, called Pons’ bluff.  They said they’d be happy to analyze the palladium   to see how much helium was present. Pons says  they can’t do that for nebulous legal reasons.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That decision is not up to us. We have  a prior commitment and the decision is not   up to us. We will get fast results, we  will get these analyses done forthwith.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Reporter: Can you explain the  nature of the prior commitments? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Narrator: Los Alamos is in talks with U of  U to make a collaboration happen. That deal,   like many more to come, would soon fall apart. </p>
<p>Pons’ ever growing paranoia, and Utah’s fear of   handing the reigns over to the federal government,  meant that negotiations would soon break down. &gt;&gt; Los Alamos laboratory has broken off  negotiations with the University of Utah   to collaborate on the Pons-Fleischmann  experiments.</p>
<p>The lab director says Los   Alamos is tired of waiting for the U and will  continue collaborating with BYU and Texas A&amp;M. &gt;&gt;Narrator: Later on a reporter, Tom Heppenheimer,   angrily asks them why they haven’t been  able to run tests looking for helium. &gt;&gt; Reporter: Where is it? &gt;&gt; Pons: We have not run that analysis yet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Reporter: Why not? &gt;&gt; Pons: It is being run now. &gt;&gt; Reporter: You heard that people  promised a three day turnaround, I can get— &gt;&gt; Pons: I did not—I found out about that an  hour ago okay. I’ve not waited for labratories— &gt;&gt; Reporter: You just dodged </p>
<p>the must essential issue— &gt;&gt; Pons: What? &gt;&gt; Reporter: You just dodged  the must essential issue— &gt;&gt;Narrator: To make matters worse for our duo,  the list of speakers got a last minute addition.   Nathan Lewis had called in a favour, and was going   to commandeer the podium to ensure the  negative side was properly represented. &gt;&gt; We have no evidence for helium.</p>
<p>We have  seen no neutrons at levels 10 to the 7 times   more sensitive than are reported by the  University of Utah results. We have seen   no evidence of gamma rays. We have seen no </p>
<p>tritium in excess of the tritium that would   be obtained by the natural enrichment  of tritium in water. In conclusion,   we have no evidence in our laboratory  with any of our samples for fusion. It   is very difficult to believe that there are </p>
<p>three sets of magic samples in the world. &gt;&gt; One of the more memorable criticisms Lewis  made was the lack of stirring in the cell,   which may lead to hot and cold spots. Pons and  Fleischmann tried to rebut this with a video   presentation.</p>
<p>They showed one of their cells  bubbling, and then added a red dye to it. They   argued that if the dye mixed in uniformly,  then by extension so would the temperature.   Lewis disagreed, and argued they could not know  this for sure unless they had actually measured   this with multiple thermometers.</p>
<p>When they’re  asked some critical questions about their   gamma ray data, Fleischmann, through a bit of  wishy-washy language, retracts the data. Their   most convincing piece of evidence was now  gone, and a key reason many scientists lost   respect for the duo.</p>
<p>And for what felt like  the millionth time, they were asked if they   had run a control with light water. Fleischmann  jumps in to say they never have. Chuck Martin,   who is sitting in the audience, is stunned by </p>
<p>this, as he had spoken to Pons over the phone   one day and heard the exact opposite. But one  moment, more than any other, will be shared on the   news all across the country. While Nathan Lewis  is complaining about the lack of public data,   Fleischmann loses his cool and they have a tense </p>
<p>exchange which requires a moderator to intervene. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m very sorry that professor Lewis  has no information on the tritium levels,   that is available and is available  in the correction list to the paper. &gt;&gt; Lewis: We know the foreground, we don&#x27;t know </p>
<p>the background. I would like to specifically— &gt;&gt; The background—I beg your pardon,   the background is available in  the corrections to the paper. &gt;&gt; Lewis: That might be. I would like to </p>
<p>specifically hear whether or not helium— &gt;&gt; Well then please don&#x27;t—don’t laugh it off. &gt;&gt; Moderator: Could we go  on to the questions please? &gt;&gt; Narrator: Fleischmann claims here that the  info Lewis wants is in the errata. Lewis backs   down in the clip, and Fleischmann appears to </p>
<p>get a win here. But when Lewis later checks   the errata published in April, the data is  nowhere to be found. Fleischmann had been   referring to a second errata, which wouldn’t  be public until June.</p>
<p>While this is going on,   Pons stares into the crowd with an expression  that says he’d rather be anywhere else. &gt;&gt;Reporter: Do you wish now looking  back on what you&#x27;ve been through in   this last month or so, that  you had just published this   quietly instead of holding the news </p>
<p>conference and kicked off this whole. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think the result would have  been any different when the paper came out. &gt;&gt; I think it would have been a very marginal—in  the end a very marginal difference, but I wish   we had been left to get on with our work at </p>
<p>our own pace without the media attention. &gt;&gt; Narrator: This would be their last press  conference in public for almost an entire year.   There had been six major meetings in just two  months dedicated to cold fusion. Unprecedented   for any scientific phenomena.</p>
<p>There will  continue to be meetings hosted all over,   but attendance continues to drop. The next  one in Santa Fe they plan for 1500 attendees,   but only 500 show up. And although they have </p>
<p>their fair share of interesting details,   they can be summed up with the comments of Edward  Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb. Perhaps the   most accomplished fusion expert in the world.  Although he wanted to believe in cold fusion,   he suggested that they needed an entirely new  particle to explain what they were seeing.</p>
<p>The   Meshugatron. A play on the Yiddish word for  crazy. It’s here where we’ll fast forward. [Music] If you wanted, you could tell the story of cold </p>
<p>fusion week by week all the way till the end of   1989. I’ll leave that for the books. Instead, I’ll  cover the highlights. In April the Secretary of   Energy, James Watkins, had ordered all 12 of </p>
<p>the US national labs to work on cold fusion,   and he had asked for weekly progress reports. In  the meantime, he had also ordered the creation   of a dedicated panel to investigate the issue.  This panel was led by John Huizenga, an alumnus   of the Manhattan project. He assembled a group </p>
<p>of 22 members, including Richard Garwin of IBM,   Steve Koonin of Caltech, and Darleane Hoffman  of Berkeley. Their job was to review the data   of all labs reporting positive results, and in  several cases they had members visit in person. To avoid accusations of bias, the </p>
<p>panel consisted of a mixture nuclear   fusion physicists, electrochemists, and  everything in between. Accusations of   bias would be made regardless,  many of them by Stanley Pons. &gt;&gt;News Anchor: Fusion scientist </p>
<p>Stanley Pons previously put his   lab off limits to the committee saying they  are biased against the experiments. The last   minute changes in that committee  cleared the way for this visit. &gt;&gt;Narrator: Despite telling him beforehand they </p>
<p>wanted to see a full calibration dataset for a   working cell, when they arrived Pons said he  didn’t have that, and that none of the cells   were currently producing excess heat because they  had just had a power failure. Notably, when the   panel visited other labs, like that of Texas A&amp;M,  and Stanford, not a single visit happened to occur   when a cell was actively producing heat.</p>
<p>But on  the other hand there was an ever growing list of   labs that had negative results: MIT, Caltech, Bell  Labs, Brookhaven, Yale, Los Alamos, Princeton,   University of Michigan, Sandia, Argonne,  Max Planck Institute, University of Tokyo,   Chalk River. For Fleischmann the most demoralizing </p>
<p>one on a personal level had to be Harwell. &gt;&gt; Britain&#x27;s Harwell laboratory  announced it is giving up its   attempts to duplicate the fusion experiments. &gt;&gt;Narrator: He had personally sent them fusion  cells a month before the announcement banking on   their neutron detectors to see something he </p>
<p>hadn’t. But they declared in June that they   were stopping all cold fusion experiments.  Harwell’s reputation is such that it basically   killed cold fusion entirely in the UK. And  by now many of the labs that had initially   come out in favour had one by one retracted </p>
<p>their results for one reason or another.   It’s worth exploring some of those reasons. On April 10th, two groups had raced to become   the first in the country to confirm cold fusion.  They were Georgia Tech, led by James Mahaffey,   and Texas A&amp;M, led by Chuck Martin. Georgia Tech  later announced an error just four days later.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Fusion researchers at Georgia  Tech have apparently run into a snag. &gt;&gt;Narrator: They realized with horror that  their neutron detector was highly sensitive   to temperature. So much so that even holding it </p>
<p>in their hands doubled the neutron reading. This   is the sort of everyday equipment issue that  would have been identified long before ever   going public. But because this was cold fusion,  and everyone was in a race to get second, basic   mistakes were made due to urgency.</p>
<p>It was such a  miserable experience that Mahaffey described the   retraction as quote: “like going to a hanging,  where I was the hangee.” The oversensitivity   of neutron detectors was a widespread problem  at several labs. At the minuscule scales they   were observing, you could see a neutron spike from </p>
<p>nearly anything. A radiation source one room over,   a sodium lamp, or a sudden power draw in the  electrical grid. Nuclear science labs, more than   most places, would be filled with contaminants  leftover from past experiments.</p>
<p>And even suppliers   of palladium are found to have traces of tritium  in their stocks before they ever get to a lab. Chuck Martin’s group found they were  seeing excess heat in light water as   well as heavy water. They even swapped </p>
<p>out palladium for carbon electrodes,   and they still saw it. After much digging  they realized that their thermometer had   not been properly grounded. It was supplying  extra electrical current, heating the water   slightly.</p>
<p>Their retraction comes two weeks after  their initial press conference. Chuck Martin,   who was a close friend of Pons, spent weeks  in a state of personal agony over the issue,   but eventually decided to retract the paper.  Pons viewed this as a personal betrayal.</p>
<p>Two grad students in Seattle made waves on April  13th when they became the first groups to claim   evidence of tritium production. They were using a  mass spectrometer to count gas molecules. H2 has   a mass of 2.</p>
<p>D2 has a mass of 4, DT has a mass of  5, and TT has a mass of 6. If they saw masses of   5 and 6, it would imply tritium production.  However, this is still an ambiguous test,   as it relied on the assumption that  DDH and D3 were not being produced,   which also have masses of 5 and 6 respectively. </p>
<p>When they reran the experiment, they confirmed   that they were seeing plenty of DDH, but no  DT. They retracted their results on May 25th. Lewis’ group at Caltech worked for weeks trying  to come up with every possible explanation for   a false positive.</p>
<p>When they found one, they  would go around phoning labs and warn them of   these pitfalls. One way to detect tritium is  to mix a special chemical cocktail. Tritium,   being radioactive, will cause the cocktail </p>
<p>to emit small flashes of light. However,   they soon discovered the lithium electrolyte  in the water bath has small traces of potassium   in it, which also causes the small flashes.  They also found an explanation for why some   labs were seeing small amounts of helium  embedded in their palladium rods.</p>
<p>Helium   is often used as a cooling agent in general  lab work. Over time glassware will slowly   absorb helium. Throughout the cold fusion  experiments small amounts of helium were   leeching into the palladium.</p>
<p>In fact, this  was the same reason that Paneth and Peters   retracted their fusion paper all the way back  in the 1920s. History had just repeated itself. Robert Huggins’ group at Stanford claimed they </p>
<p>saw excess heat in both light and heavy water,   with heavy water showing noticeably more.  What his group didn’t account for is that   heavy water and light water have different  electrical conductivity when lithium is   added. With everything else the same, the  heavy water will get hotter.</p>
<p>But besides   this there also seemed to be a pattern with  when they saw excess heat. It happened most   often on the weekends. This is because less  electricity is used on the grid on weekends,   meaning slightly higher voltages were </p>
<p>being supplied to the experiment. One thing that both critics and advocates of  cold fusion agree on is that excess heat is   inconsistent. You’d only see it very occasionally.  As one member of the government panel, Al Bard,   argued, what was happening is that all the results </p>
<p>are points on a bell curve distribution. Some will   show excess heat, most will show nothing, and some  will even show negative. But that’s how statistics   work in an experimental setting. The average </p>
<p>result is what you want to focus on. Therefore   it’s misleading to publish a paper with positive  results while neglecting to mention you saw far   more negative results. If you actually took  the negative results into account, your graphs   would have massive error bars, showing that the </p>
<p>excess heat was well within the margin of error. The government panel worked well into the Fall.  By their estimation around $30 million had been   spent by US labs attempting to replicate the  effect, and another $10 million abroad. When they   published their final report in November, they </p>
<p>concluded that there was not quote: “convincing   evidence that useful sources of energy will result  from the phenomena attributed to cold fusion.” &gt;&gt; The prospect of federal funding for  cold fusion research virtually vanished   today. The advisory group&#x27;s recommendations  are not binding on the energy department,   but it would be unusual if they were ignored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Although the panel largely came to a consensus,  there was one bit of internal drama. One of the   two co-chairs, Norman Ramsey, had been largely  absent from the panel for most its tenure. When   he took the role on he made a note to say it </p>
<p>seemed quote: “a terrible job”. And according   to John Huizenga his co-chair, Ramsey spent  most of the summer abroad, and later in the   year he won a Nobel Prize, and was even less  available. When they were drafting the final   report he blindsided by them by announcing that </p>
<p>he was going to resign. Having such a high profile   member resign right before they published would  severely undermine the credibility of the report.   Ramsey was willing to stay on if they included  a preamble he wrote which was much less negative   about cold fusion than the rest of the report. The </p>
<p>panel, feeling they had been backed into a corner,   accepted the lesser evil of including  the wishy-washy introduction. Still,   Ramsey’s ultimatum would fuel rumours of  conspiracy and a coverup. Chase Peterson   alleged that the panel was biased.</p>
<p>Quote: “the  university’s loudest critics have come from large,   well financed schools that have sizeable stakes  in the more conventional, and more expensive,   hot fusion projects.” On the other hand, more  than a few hot fusion experts said the opposite. &gt;&gt; In terms of the hard work I&#x27;ve put in </p>
<p>for 10 years on this project, you know   it&#x27;s sort of like a kick in the teeth, but I  certainly hope that they have something there. &gt;&gt; If this development says that  all the work that you&#x27;ve done in   the past is really not relevant now  because we have this new energy source,   safe, cheap, and environmentally benign. </p>
<p>I’d just be tickled pink if we had that. &gt;&gt; The federal government would not fund cold  fusion, although they were quote: “sympathetic   toward modest support for carefully focused and  cooperative experiments within the present funding   system.” The report almost concluded with a quote  from Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p>It was removed from the   final version at the suggestion of Darleane  Hoffman. She felt that it would only feed into   pre-existing perceptions of believers that the  panel was biased. The quote went like this: ‘Alice   laughed.</p>
<p>“There’s no use trying,” she said. “One  can’t believe impossible things.” “I daresay you   haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When  I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour   a day.</p>
<p>Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many  as six impossible things before breakfast.’” [Music] &gt;&gt; If cold fusion was to be brought back from  the brink of death, it needed a miracle. How   appropriate given its birthplace. Most of the </p>
<p>American public had lost interest and moved   on with their lives, but according to a poll  taken in September, 61% of Utah residents still   believed in cold fusion. When Nature rejected  Pons and Fleischmann’s paper, the lieutenant   governor stated quote: “We are not going to allow  some English magazine to decide how state money   is handled.” The first ever annual cold fusion </p>
<p>conference was held, as you might have guessed,   in Salt Lake City, just a little over one year  since the announcement. The Governor of Utah was   a guest of honor at the reception, and dessert was  provided by the Utah based company Mrs. Field’s   cookies.</p>
<p>The state of Utah had paid $5 million to  establish their National Cold Fusion Institute,   and they were going to make sure they got their  money’s worth. In July 1989 a state appointed   panel would vote on whether to release the bulk of  the $5 million to the NCFI.</p>
<p>The decision rested on   whether cold fusion had been “confirmed” or  not. Notably, the council had nine members,   but only two of them were scientists, and  one of those two was actively writing his   own cold fusion funding proposal. Although by </p>
<p>this point there were far too many conflicting   results to determine anything concrete, all  9 members of the panel voted yes on the 21st. &gt;&gt; I didn’t say I would give us an A, or a B ,or  a C, or a D. I said we passed and so I voted.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Justification? Well it seems to me that if  you can spend half a billion dollars for 20   years on hot fusion and not get anywhere you  can certainly spend a few million dollars,   a mere 10 million or something like that, on  cold fusion. So I would vote absolutely for it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; News Anchor: And with the vote of confidence  attorney general Paul Van Dam says despite news   reports to the contrary, the experiments  are now legally scientifically confirmed. &gt;&gt;Narrator: They rented out a fancy new building  in the university’s research park, which would   cost them nearly $300k in just the first year. </p>
<p>Chase Peterson’s vision for the institute was to   hire somewhere between 40 to 100 researchers. They  would not just be studying cold fusion, but making   working commercial prototypes. But ever since  its inception it had been doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Namely,   because Pons and Fleischmann  wanted nothing to do with it. Hugo Rossi was the dean of science at U of U  and one of the first people Pons told about   cold fusion. They had a solid relationship, </p>
<p>and because he was trained as a mathematician,   Rossi mostly took Pons at his word on the  experiments. By the summer it was clear that   they needed someone in charge of the institute,  and Rossi stepped up as interim director. A big   part of his job was to attract funding, which </p>
<p>translated to PR. Rossi became a target for   much public criticism, which likely contributed  to a sense of stubbornness. He thought that   the critics of cold fusion were being far too  negative when it was still early days.</p>
<p>Quote:   “I am somebody who left the whole Cambridge  complex to come out to Utah not because it’s   God’s territory but because I rebelled against the  smug sureness. And that’s what I kept seeing in   all this. Maybe it was just wishful thinking. </p>
<p>God, I want those smug assholes to be wrong.   Those people who were just so damned sure of  themselves.” His first order of business was   to hire researchers, and naturally, he asked Pons  and Fleischmann. To his surprise, they said no. &gt;&gt; That Carol, was one of the concerns expressed </p>
<p>by the council today. It has been made very clear   that Pons and Fleischmann prefer to stay in their  own lab in the basement of the chemistry building.  &gt;&gt; Why? Explanations vary, but it would be  reasonable to assume that they were a bit   territorial after their issues with Steven Jones  and Marvin Hawkins.</p>
<p>This was their discovery,   and splitting the credit even further wasn’t  something they were super eager about. It’s   also likely that Pons and Fleischmann were  distrustful of the U of U administration,   particularly Chase Peterson, who they were now  blaming for forcing the press conference and   any embarrassment that came along with it.</p>
<p>Many  people observed that between the two of them,   Fleischmann dealt with the stress far better than  Pons. Fleischmann had always been very social and   a confident public speaker, whereas Pons was  an introverted homebody who had a very close   circle of friends.</p>
<p>And as questions about the  work began to turn into doubt, Pons was visibly   cracking under the pressure. Quote: “I don’t think  I’ve ever seen a man driven to such impatience,   almost as though a stone in the shoe would have  driven him wild at that point.</p>
<p>The way people   behave when they’re under far more pressure than  the good Lord meant them to be under.” Even John   Bockris, one of Pons’ remaining allies,  said he worried for Pons’ mental health. At first, Rossi had understood Pons and  Fleischmann’s reluctance to collaborate   with other groups, but as the months marched </p>
<p>on and the retractions kept coming out he was   now frustrated with their unwillingness to play  nice. In June, he sent them a letter that said   something to the effect of “we’re losing the  propaganda war.” After significant prodding,   they agreed to some form of partnership, they set  up a couple of their cells at the institute.</p>
<p>But   later, Rossi found out that they set them up  as a dummy experiment. Two cells were running,   but with nothing to collect data. In other  words, they were just running electricity   into a jar of water for show.</p>
<p>Rossi would  defend Pons and Fleischmann for longer than   most. He didn’t assume fraud for the longest  time, although he did call Pons paranoid,   and mentioned that he was quote: “sandbagging the  community.” And Rossi only grew further wary of   Pons when he submitted a funding request for </p>
<p>equipment sold by a company his son worked at. By August the institute had  only hired two researchers,   and their names didn’t start with a P or  an F. Rossi was quickly becoming jaded and   desperate.</p>
<p>BYU flatout refused to be  associated with the place for obvious   reasons. Eventually he did sign on Marvin  Hawkins, since he had nowhere else to go. &gt;&gt; Reporter: If this is not fusion, if it is </p>
<p>some unknown chemical reaction, did we lose? &gt;&gt; Who lost? Are you kidding, we&#x27;ve done  science, we&#x27;ve got results that has stretched the   imagination, we have got the public thinking in  a very positive scientific way. Has anybody lost?   Not a single person. If this goes absolutely </p>
<p>bust nobody&#x27;s lost, especially not science. &gt;&gt;Narrator: Mark Anderson, who had taken over  from Hawkins, decided to take a job elsewhere, and   leave cold fusion behind. In the meantime, Rossi  had managed to recruit at least one physics prof   in a sort of watchdog role.</p>
<p>Mike  Salamon from U of U. He knew all   about the drama surrounding the gamma rays  and he wanted to help clear up the confusion. &gt;&gt; One, has fusion been seen here at the </p>
<p>University of Utah? Quite possibly. Has the large   energy output that Pons and Fleischmann see due to  nuclear fusion? No, we really don&#x27;t believe it is. &gt;&gt; Reporter: It&#x27;s probably something else? &gt;&gt; Our attitude is— we&#x27;re raising our hands,   we don&#x27;t know what it is. It&#x27;s possible it </p>
<p>is fusion. If it is we have a lot to learn. &gt;&gt; He offered to set up some of his detectors in  Pons’ lab. One night Salamon got a call from Mark   Anderson that a cell was boiling.</p>
<p>Salamon  rushed over to the lab, saw that it was,   and rushed off to get more equipment. Except when  he came back, the cell was off. Pons had told   Anderson to turn it off so they wouldn’t waste </p>
<p>any heavy water. Salamon was dumbstruck. This   was the only time in over a month he had seen  any cells boil, and Pons was clearly trying to   prevent him from getting any meaningful data. Then </p>
<p>Pons told him needed space for a new detector,   and so Salamon took his gear and he left. Pons  would later send him a letter telling him that   there had been one cell with excess heat  while Salamon’s equipment was in the lab,   but it just so happened to occur right after a  power outage that had reset his equipment.</p>
<p>It   was the kind of coincidence that was  downright insulting to even suggest. On August 23rd, Salamon holds a press conference  where he announces his negative results. He went   on to write a very negative paper and submitted </p>
<p>it to Nature, which was published on the one-year   anniversary of the original press conference.  Once the paper was in print Gary Triggs sent   threatening letters accusing him of libel  and demanding a retraction. Pons had tried   to use Triggs to silence critics before, but  this had crossed a very serious line because   Salamon was a fellow professor at U of U, causing </p>
<p>a major PR crisis. It was soon uncovered that U   of U had previously paid Gary Triggs as much  as $68,000 for Pons’ legal fees. That meant,   technically, U of U was paying a lawyer so that  one of their professors could sue another one of   their professors.</p>
<p>This was a massive conflict  of interest, and as soon as this fact was made   public, U of U cut ties with Triggs. Salamon too  would abandon cold fusion. Quote: “My continued   involvement, even in a sort of an adversarial </p>
<p>role, was being perceived as extraordinarily   stupid on my part. It was beginning to  blacken my reputation with the faculty.” On September 26th Rossi tells the Salt Lake City  Tribune that if that if the institute has no   solid data to present by February, then they’ll  have to shut down.</p>
<p>He gave that statement in   response to a direct question from a reporter,  but the way it was portrayed in the paper was:   Quote: “State-funded lab may soon stop cold-fusion  experiments.” Now you’ve got the governor pissed,   and Pons and Fleischmann think  Rossi has stabbed them in the   back. In private they send letters </p>
<p>where they rant about Rossi. Quote:   “He’s bent…he lies out of his teeth.” Now you’ve  got private companies freezing their investments.   Rossi wants to resign but realizes the terrible  optics of that move, and so he sticks with it. But the final straw for him was the double-blind </p>
<p>double-cross. By now Pons and Fleischmann were   full in on the third decay branch as their  last resort. It was statistically unlikely,   but if the palladium rods showed evidence of  helium, then it would be potential evidence   of fusion.</p>
<p>And so a bunch of skeptical labs like  MIT and Sandia, called their bluff, and said sure,   let us analyze them. After much back and  forth, Pons finally agrees as long as a   neutral third party acted as a mediator. Two of </p>
<p>the five rods had helium artificially added as a   control. One rod was completely clean and had  no helium. And the remaining two rods had been   run in fusion cells and had supposedly generated  excess heat, and therefore helium.</p>
<p>Critically,   the labs testing for helium don’t know which rods  are which, and Pons doesn’t know which rods were   sent where. It’s a double blind test. On October  6th Stan Pons went to meet with the neutral   third party.</p>
<p>The deal was that both parties would  exchange data. Pons was given the helium analysis,   and then he just refused to share which rods  showed excess heat. He had just willfully,   knowingly, ruined the double blind nature of </p>
<p>the test. The results of the helium analysis   were just as confusing. The rod that was supposed  to have zero helium in it ended up showing helium.   Whether this was an accidental contamination or  an intentional mix-up was impossible to prove,   but it rendered the entire experiment useless. </p>
<p>But more to the point, the one cell that had   supposedly generated heat did not show helium  above the background level. The other labs   wanted to publish these results, but Gary Triggs  sent them all legal threats. This meant that the   helium results were only made public an entire </p>
<p>year later in late 1990. The helium fiasco was   a step too far for Rossi. Not only that,  but the faculty at U of U were saying that   if he stayed involved with cold fusion, they’d  likely push for him not to come back as dean.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The interim director of Utah&#x27;s cold fusion   institute is stepping down to  make room for some new blood. &gt;&gt; News Anchor: But the man who&#x27;s headed  this controversial private corporation   claims convenience, not conflict,  prompted his resignation 6 weeks early.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; When he was back at U of U, he joined the  rest of the faculty in demanding a full review   of the institute. Pons and Fleischmann would be  hauled in and interrogated by state officials. [Music] There was just one problem.</p>
<p>They were  nowhere to be found. Between the two of them,   Fleischmann was the easier one to track down. He  had long since gone back to England, supposedly   for medical reasons.</p>
<p>He claimed the school had  not made a good faith effort to contact him,   and he declined to attend the review. Pons on the  other hand was nearly impossible to track down. He   was so rarely in his own lab that some people </p>
<p>theorized he had moved his experiments to his   own home, although there was no major  evidence of this. And then one day,   he’s just gone. He has subs teaching his classes.  His house was put up for sale.</p>
<p>No one knows where   he is. The first official contact from him is  a letter via Gary Triggs where he says he’s   resigning as a tenured professor, and asks for a  temporary research position instead. Later he’ll   ask for a year long leave of absence, which </p>
<p>will be denied. The public pressure had been   crushing for Pons. By this point, physicist Frank  Close had published his book, Too Hot to Handle,   which came as close as UK libel law would allow,  to implying fraud on the part of Pons.</p>
<p>When Close   had interviewed Fleischmann, he appeared to lay  the blame of the gamma ray peaks entirely on Pons. But the hate had extended to his family.  His house was bombarded with phone calls,   some threatening. His wife Sheila described </p>
<p>how classmates of their daughter began to bully   her. Quote: “Our daughter was in school.  At the time, she was 11 or 12 years old,   a very sensitive age. Some of the children said  to her, ‘Your dad’s a fraud.</p>
<p>Why did he do this   to us. Why do we have Utah smeared like this  because of your dad.’” Cold fusion had begun as   a source of Utah pride. But the state had turned  on Pons for embarrassing them.</p>
<p>Even Fleischmann   is told in February that it’s highly unlikely  he’ll be reappointed as a visiting professor.   The next time Pons was seen in Utah was when  the institute was undergoing its review,   for which he was required to make an appearance.  He did so only after Utah’s Assistant Attorney   General told him he didn’t have a choice. This </p>
<p>very well could be the final time he stepped   foot in Utah. When questioned by the review  panel, he said the same thing he’d said since   it was first announced to the world. To Pons,  cold fusion was real.</p>
<p>But that didn’t matter. Following some investigative reporting it  was revealed that $500k in donations was   made to the cold fusion institute that did not  come from an external source, but was in fact   university funds that Chase Peterson shuffled  around.</p>
<p>Although not strictly illegal, it was   incredibly deceptive, clearly an attempt to reel  in more outside money. This was a disaster for PR,   and a private company halted their donation of  $160k. Chase Peterson had a no confidence motion   pushed on him by the faculty.</p>
<p>They wanted him  gone. Contrary to what he said a year earlier,   Peterson says he did not necessarily believe  in cold fusion. He just said that if there’s   even an infinitesimal chance it was, that the </p>
<p>enormous benefits justified taking a chance on   it. He clearly believed that enough that it cost  him his job. Knowing he was a dead man walking,   he announced he would resign in a year’s  time.</p>
<p>This seemed to satisfy his faculty,   and they let him live out his remaining term as a  lame duck. Peterson resigned as president in June   1991. That same month the institute is shut down.  The $5 million they had been gifted by the state   had run out, and no new money was coming in.</p>
<p>It  was over. Even Utah had given up on cold fusion. The same could be seen in miniature in  Washington, where cold fusion had become   taboo.</p>
<p>Only Wayne Owens, representative for  Utah, wasted any breath on the topic. Here he is   giving a passionate speech arguing for continued  funding despite the earlier disappointments. The   way he’s speaking you’d think he was addressing a </p>
<p>packed audience, but when the CSPAN feed cuts to   a wider shot of the chamber, it feels almost  like the camera crew has a sense of humour. We should take a moment to  revisit our friend Steven Jones,   who had spent that past several  months portraying himself as more   pragmatic and rational version of Pons and </p>
<p>Fleischmann. He had accepted an offer from   Yale to collaborate. They had offered up their  highly sensitive neutron detectors. Remember,   Jones’ claim was that he saw no excess heat, but </p>
<p>he did see an extremely subtle neutron spike. &gt;&gt; The confidence level is about 1 chance in 2  million right now that we have made a mistake. &gt;&gt; Narrator: Yale was even going to shut  down its particle accelerator for a week   to lower the background radiation.</p>
<p>This  was a prime chance for Jones to cement   his credibility. But several months went  by, the collaboration went up in flames. &gt;&gt; I’m not sure you&#x27;re doing </p>
<p>the right experiment either   Moshe. You have to look at the—you look at just— &gt;&gt; You are not sure I am  doing the right experiment— &gt;&gt; Jones: My experiment. &gt;&gt; —but I am convinced that you’re  not doing the right neutron counting &gt;&gt; Narrator: Jones refused to put his name </p>
<p>on any of the data, data that showed no signs   of neutrons. The Yale group went ahead and  published without him, a scathing rebuke of   Jones’ claims. There are other controversial  disputes that arise.</p>
<p>One of the more notable   is the tritium spiking allegations at Texas  A&amp;M. A group led by John Bockris is accused   of fraud by fellow professors and a journalist.  An internal investigation dragged on for a year,   and in the end did not conclusively prove  intentional tampering.</p>
<p>But the tritium   readings that were once credited with keeping  cold fusion’s hopes alive during the summer of   1989 were almost certainly due to contamination.  Bockris’ reputation is stained for the rest of his   career. Pons had warned many people of the deadly  potential of this experiment.</p>
<p>Only once did his   fears come true. On January 2nd 1992, a group at  the Stanford Research Institute had accidentally   mixed together a highly flammable amount of  hydrogen and oxygen. It wasn’t fusion, it   was just a normal deadly explosion.</p>
<p>Three people  were injured, and one researcher, Andrew Riley,   was killed in the blast. The lab continued their  work, but now with bullet proof glass installed. A year goes by.</p>
<p>Then another. Cold fusion has  become a taboo. In America and the UK it is seen   as a colossal waste of time, energy and money.  The only ones still working on it are either   doing it through self funding, or they’re doing </p>
<p>it in secret, tucked away in a larger lab afraid   of what their bosses might say if they found  out. Even if you were trying to disprove it,   it’s seen as beneath you. Anyone who wanted to  be taken seriously were better off pretending it   didn’t exist.</p>
<p>For the public, who can only follow  what the news tells them, cold fusion feels like a   future that was ripped away from them. The lofty  promises that were made on March 23rd 1989 have   yet to pan out. They were promised a future that </p>
<p>would be full of clean energy. They were told that   a gallon of sea water was enough to power a city.  There wasn’t supposed to be another Exxon Valdez,   no more Chernobyls. Cold fusion had instead become  a joke.</p>
<p>A throwaway punchline in an episode of the   Simpsons. That thing you heard about a few years  ago. “Whatever happened to that?” you’ll wonder,   before moving on with your day. But there were </p>
<p>also those who didn’t forget. A certain subset,   they believe something more sinister happened.  Who was trying to shut this down? Hot fusion   physicists? The Big Banks? Big Oil? Even as early  as May 1989 members of the public were suspicious   that some sort of coverup must be happening.  Take for instance this CSPAN phone call-in hour.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Caller: All right you know on an  ABC station in Fort Wayne Indiana,   they said there&#x27;s nothing to this fusion  deal. That was early this week and I   was wondering who&#x27;s trying to cover it up  will it come to pass will we ever get it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, sure— &gt;&gt; Narrator: Among the most prominent of these  conspiracy mongers was Eugene Mallove. At the   time of the Utah announcement he was MIT’s  chief science writer and wrote many of their   press releases. He believed that researchers </p>
<p>at MIT altered their data in an attempt to   disprove cold fusion, and resigned in protest. He  founded a magazine, wrote books, and even shot a   documentary arguing that cold fusion was a victim  of a conspiracy, a widescale reputation trap. &gt;&gt; The field of cold fusion has been marginalized </p>
<p>by the establishment by creating certain myths   about it, and pejorative terminology  being used which is highly inappropriate,   has no bearing at all on what&#x27;s being  done, called pathological science,   junk science. It&#x27;s just basically name  calling.</p>
<p>The equivalent of demanding   that cold fusion works like hot fusion is  like saying a transistor works like a radio   tube. It&#x27;s idiotic, it&#x27;s stupid, it makes  no sense and yet that&#x27;s what was demanded. &gt;&gt; He will spend the rest of his life arguing </p>
<p>that commercial cold fusion energy is just a   couple years away. Always a couple years away.  By 1994 there was a bit of a lingering question. &gt;&gt; Pons and Fleischmann themselves  disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Where   did they go? To the south of France that&#x27;s where. &gt;&gt; Narrator: A company called Technova had  decided to invest in Pons and Fleischmann’s   research. Technova as it turned  out, was a subsidiary of Toyota.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Reporter: Pons and Fleischmann now work  in a $15 million lab created for them by the   Japanese. In retrospect they recall they really  had no choice but to leave the United States. &gt;&gt; Narrator: Yet another moment of irony. </p>
<p>For the first time in years the two men   seemed happy to be giving interviews. But it  was clear the controversy had taken its toll. &gt;&gt; I can remember that I was extremely  bitter and upset at the time.</p>
<p>Thought we&#x27;d   been treated extremely unjustly which  I still do. Again I think the critics   were not operating within the bounds of sanity and I think we were victimized   in that respect. I really don&#x27;t have any feelings </p>
<p>about it anymore it&#x27;s just a non-issue now. &gt;&gt; Fleischmann: I think you become numb &gt;&gt; You become numb to it. &gt;&gt; Narrator: But if anything,  he was even more confident. &gt;&gt; I mean the criticisms that came </p>
<p>were—90-95% of the criticism was   just unwarranted. Could almost use  the word stupid for most of it. &gt;&gt; Reporter: And how many years away might  you be from developing something like that? &gt;&gt; Well the first the first prototypes we built   now are—need to be redesigned.</p>
<p>I would  say probably by the end of the year. &gt;&gt;Reporter: Within a year? You&#x27;re kidding. &gt;&gt; No I think that&#x27;s attainable. &gt;&gt; Narrator: This prediction by Pons did not </p>
<p>come to fruition. In 1995 he and Fleischmann   had a permanent falling out. Japan’s  government pulled their funding in 1997,   and a year later the lab closed entirely.  The estimated investment was £12 million.   We have very few details about what went down </p>
<p>between the two men. According to Physics World,   Fleischmann and Pons disagreed on the direction  of the research and Fleischmann felt like he   was being ignored. The 2012 documentary The  Believers contains some of the last interviews   with Fleischmann.</p>
<p>It ends with the question of  whether he’s still friends with Stanley Pons,   the man he used to host a yearly Christmas  party with. His answer is no. It’s clearly a   painful memory.</p>
<p>He ponders for a moment what he  would ask Pons if he saw him again. Two things.   “How are you?” And after a bit of laughter,  quote: “Are you continuing with the dreadful   research?” Fleischmann will never fully give  up on cold fusion, he’ll continue to keep in   touch with those in the field, and even attend the </p>
<p>occasional cold fusion conference. He passed away   in 2012 due to complications from Parkinson’s.  If Stanley Pons was hard to get a hold of before,   he would eventually vanish off the face of  the earth. He lives on a farm in France with   his wife.</p>
<p>He has no plans to return to the  US, and he gave up his citizenship. He has   never given a recorded interview since. All we  know is that he just wants to be left alone.</p>
<p>[Music] In 1911, frustrated by a flood of patent  applications for perpetual motion machines,   the US Patent Commissioner mandated that all  submissions now required a prototype to run   for a full year before it would be accepted. To  date there has never been a successful patent for   a perpetual motion machine.</p>
<p>And in 2004 the  Patent Office had made it routine policy to   reject any submission that mentioned cold fusion.  Many will still try by using a different name,   but it’s nearly impossible for them not to  mention the Pons and Fleischmann experiment   in some form. By the late 1990s cold fusion </p>
<p>had become ubiquitous shorthand in popular   culture as a synonym for nonsense science.  The name had become toxic. This a graph of   papers mentioning cold fusion since 1989.  After the massive explosion of papers in   1989 and 1990 the publication rate falls off a  cliff.</p>
<p>Most of them never even peer reviewed. As early as 1994 even advocates had begun to  downplay the label. They argued that cold fusion   was a misnomer. It hadn’t been coined by Pons </p>
<p>and Fleischmann, and by now many felt that the   effect they were seeing might not even be fusion.  Some took to calling it the Pons and Fleischmann   effect. Steven Jones tried to push for, quote:  “anomalous effects in deuterated metals”,   but his word salad never caught on. The only </p>
<p>name that had any major staying power was LENR,   or L.E.N.R. Short for low energy nuclear  reactions. It does its job well. It’s mundane,   and could apply to a dozen different phenomena. </p>
<p>And it has none of the baggage. Although even this   acronym is divisive, as some people insist that  it should stand for something like lattice enabled   nuclear reactions, or some other variant. And  that hints to the critical issue.</p>
<p>LENR research is   highly splintered, full of conflicting theories,  methods, and even interpersonal feuds. When Pons   and Fleischmann left the public eye, there was  no clear leader in the field to take their place.   Some insist it’s still fusion, while others argue  it’s an electroweak interaction.</p>
<p>Some argue it   can be a new source of energy, others argue it’s  just a scientific curiosity. Some say it can only   occur in heavy water, others say light water works  just fine. Some still insist on using palladium,   others have moved on to nickel.</p>
<p>Some believe  Pons and Fleischmann were mistaken but onto   to something real, while others believe  they were correct from the start but the   scientific establishment buried their results in  a concerted smear campaign. There are as many as   60 competing theoretical models, none of which </p>
<p>can make reliable predictions. And even those   who claim to see neutrons or tritium admit that  they can’t do it with any sort of consistency. The LENR advocates feel they have been pushed  out of the establishment and no one will take   them seriously.</p>
<p>Nobel Laureate Julian Schwinger  left the American Physical Society in protest   when they refused to publish his papers on it.  And so they’ve built their own communities.   Forums that serve as echo chambers, where  critical members are banned if they ask the   wrong questions. The crux of the issue </p>
<p>is that maybe there’s something there,   but the reputation trap is based  on legitimate issues. Some of the   advocates are respectable researchers with solid  backgrounds. Edmund Storms from Los Alamos,   Micheal McKubre from Stanford research, and </p>
<p>Peter Hagelstein, a tenured professor at MIT.   According to this proposal from a futurist  think tank: “At the beginning of 2017,   there were 114 entities actively engaged  in LENR R&amp;D across four continents.” But for every person with a decent  resume, there is someone who has   attached themselves to LENR’s and cold fusion  just to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>Take Randell Mills,   whose theory would require a complete  reworking of how we modeled the hydrogen atom,   a new type of particle he called the hydrino.  Mills has also trademarked the term hydrino,   which means that a third party experimentalist  can’t easily test his theories without first   signing an IP agreement with him. Then </p>
<p>there is Italian entrepreneur Andrea Rossi,   who promised commercial cold fusion reactor  called E-Cat for a decade with no results. He   is a blatant snakeoil salesman, with a prior  history of white collar crime convictions.   Despite his claims all patents he’s been awarded  do not mention cold fusion.</p>
<p>And Patrick Cochrane   had his Nevada cold fusion startup go bankrupt  after raising a million dollars and he faced   charges from the SEC. Those are just some of  the grifters, and then you have the quacks. Take Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson.</p>
<p>He  firmly believes in cold fusion, just like   he advocates for homeopathy, quantum mysticism  and parapsychology. Next is Dirdrek Irving. A   former cardiologist turned cold fusion advocate, </p>
<p>he speaks of a personal theory of “superwaves”.   In the 2012 doc The Believers, he can be seen  telling Martin Fleischmann that he can reverse his   Parkinsons, as cold fusion is the mechanism that  both creates energy, and powers his metabolism.   Irving’s medical license was revoked in 1995.  Enthusiast blogger Ruby Carat wrote a comic book   promoting cold fusion, and the way she speaks  of it is uncannily similar to the way religious   missionaries speak about their work.</p>
<p>Quote: “You  can drop a copy by the high school chemistry club,   or leave one at the doctor’s waiting room, your  political representatives office, or the airport   terminal – someone is sure to be inspired.” Even  Steve Jones, who portrayed himself as the rational   cold fusion guy, descended into conspiracy when  he began vocally giving talks on how 9-11 was   an inside job.</p>
<p>This photo has been cropped the  entire video. This is the full photo. He parted   ways with BYU in 2006 over his views. Even if we </p>
<p>were to give the benefit of the doubt to the more   credible scientists on this end of the spectrum,  their association with these folks gives plenty of   reason to be skeptical. The fact that cold fusion  and LENR attracts this sort of person does not do   it any favours. With all of this in mind, it was </p>
<p>a major news story when in 2019 a paper appeared   in Nature titled “Revisiting the case of cold  fusion.” A team of 30 researchers across several   labs took four years to try and induce cold  fusion. Although the bit that made the headlines   was that one of the labs was funded by Google.  The Pons and Fleischmann effect was not repeated.   One of the authors, Chiang, stressed that to his </p>
<p>knowledge, no experiment has unambiguously shown   excess heat, once all energy sources and sinks are  fully accounted for. When I wrote to one of the   other authors, Matt Trevithick, he responded with  this: “The conclusion of our work was that neither   LENR believers nor skeptics have done enough work  of enough quality to support their positions.</p>
<p>LENR   covers a vast parameter space. In the limited  time and budget we had, we got a sense of the   difficulty of producing the conditions under  which cold fusion is hypothesized to exist.” Another group I spoke to, ReResearch, similarly  found no evidence of excess heat or nuclear   products.</p>
<p>As for why the repeatability of  results is so poor, they argue that most   thermal calibrations runs are far shorter than the  lengths of the experiments themselves. It’s only   when you calibrate for longer than the experiment  can you be sure that your heat measurements are   reliable.</p>
<p>Quote: “As the majority of research  over the past 30 years has not demonstrated   this kind of calibration stability, that  eliminates most of the effort in this field.” As skeptical as I am I understand why  people have clung onto this for so long. &gt;&gt; As it was pointed out we&#x27;re in </p>
<p>deep trouble come the year 2030,   so we&#x27;re going—or 2040 I think he said, so we&#x27;re  going to have to do something fast and you know   that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to push as hard as we  absolutely can to see if this is going to work. &gt;&gt; The issues that felt so urgent back in 1989 are  still the same issues we’re dealing with today,   and are barely any closer to solving them.</p>
<p>The  necessary political and societal solutions are so   divisive that they feel impossible to implement.  People want to believe in a revolutionary   source of energy that can be powered by our most  abundant resource, seawater. Because it would be   a magic bullet that would render everything else </p>
<p>irrelevant. Cold fusion won’t save us. We’ve been   through this cycle before, and we’ll go through it  again. We can’t bet everything on just technology.</p>
<p>With all that being said, with the renewed  attention in the past few years, LENR advocates   have finally gotten their wish. In 2023 the  Department of Energy’s R&amp;D fund, ARPA-E, awarded   $10 million to LENR research, spread across five  labs.</p>
<p>That’s obviously quite a huge sum of money,   but to put that in context, I’d point out that  they also awarded $1 billion to traditional hot   fusion research. The $10 million is also not  an endorsement of LENR being a real phenomenon,   just that it warrants more funding to, in their  own words: “break the stalemate.” “evidence   for LENR is insufficient due to the ambiguous </p>
<p>nature of heat, numerous confounding variables,   potential sources of measurement error,  and possible prosaic explanations.” I have not read the vast majority of what’s  been written on LENR in the past two decades.   I cannot tell you definitively that there isn’t  something there. And so I’m not going to object   if the US government or Google wants to divert </p>
<p>some of their vast pools of wealth. But what I   am confident on is that the work of Pons  and Fleischmann was rushed, misleading,   and mired with dishonesty. In recent years  there has been an effort to whitewash that   history.</p>
<p>As to whether they were treated  fairly, you’ll have to decide for yourself. The last time cold fusion made prime time news  was in 2009, when 60 Minutes aired a special   interviewing Martin Fleischmann. The special had </p>
<p>little new to show, just the same claims that   people have been making since the 90s. Fleischmann  himself hadn’t done active research in years. &gt;&gt; When you hold that in your hand and you think   back on what&#x27;s happened these  last 20 years what do you think? &gt;&gt; The wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wasted? Because it was discredited at the time? &gt;&gt;Narrator: What it did show was a man  at the tail end of his life, wondering   how this things went so wrong. &gt;&gt; I’m getting you interested again? &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; Interviewer: The potential is exciting? &gt;&gt; The potential is exciting, yes. &gt;&gt; The truth is, you can’t really kill an idea.   Once it’s out there you can  only turn the cameras off.</p>
<p>Hey! Did you know I’m producing a  feature-length documentary called   17 Pages? Well it&#x27;s true. It covers one of the  most complex and infamous controversies in the   history of American science. And you’ll be able </p>
<p>to watch it exclusively on Nebula in early 2025.  Nebula is the creator-owned streaming service I’m  part of alongside some of the best educational   creators on the internet. There you can  watch my videos and many more completely   ad-free. Not only do I post my videos 2 weeks </p>
