            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>In the center of a high platform in an awakening plaza, the pristine white awakening pillar hummed, emitting a soft glow. Beneath the enormous circular dome, thousands of young men and women gathered, their eyes filled with excitement and tension. This is a world where everyone awakens their talents. Under the iron hooves of star beasts, humanity struggles to survive, and its high-end combat power is in grave danger. Fortunately, everyone can awaken their talents through the awakening pillar upon reaching adulthood.</p>
<p>If one successfully awakens a powerful talent, one will gain strong combat power to fight against star beasts and enjoy countless privileges. However, if one fails to awaken or awakens a low-level talent, one can only sink to the bottom and live a mediocre life. Shin Yuan stood in the queue, his gaze sweeping over the crowd and fixed on the awakening platform, his heart pounded with nervousness, for he was next to step onto the stage. In this world where talent determined destiny, today would decide his future. Next, Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>A cold mechanical voice rang out from the loudspeaker. Shin Yuan stepped forward and under the watchful eyes of countless people, ascended the cold metal platform. He raised his right hand and placed his palm on the awakening stone pillar. The cold touch spread along his skin, calming his agitated emotions slightly. A beam of light suddenly rose up and enveloped him.</p>
<p>The light was not dazzling, but rather dim, displaying a gray color that represented the lowest level. The awakening officer presiding over the ceremony glanced at the light screen, his expression becoming subtle. He cleared his throat and announced loudly in a hesitant tone, &quot;Shen yuan, F- level good luck talent, guaranteed luck every shot.&quot; Upon hearing this, the students in the room fell completely silent. But just a few seconds later, a hoof of laughter broke the silence. It was unclear who was the first to burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Laughter quickly spread, and the entire square resounded with a tsunami of laughter. The mocking sounds pierced Shin Yuan&#x27;s ears like sharp buzzing, leaving his mind in chaos. He never expected that he would awaken a useless support type good luck talent, which was tantamount to a death sentence for him, leaving him with no hope of ever turning his life around. He stood frozen in the pillar of light, feeling utterly hopeless. However, just as he was falling into despair, a cold mechanical voice rang out in his mind without warning.</p>
<p>Ding! The host&#x27;s special talent and the background of the era have been detected to be highly compatible. The good luck in succession system has been activated. The system notification continued. As long as you win over women who meet the systems requirements and increase their favorability, you can trigger a lucky effect and obtain generous rewards such as talent awakening, potion recipes, and various special items. The system then issued a beginner&#x27;s task.</p>
<p>Bring good fortune to a pure goddess with a rating of 95 or higher. Condition affection level of 80 or higher. Mission rewards. One, gene potential enhancement potion recipe increases the chance of talent awakening by 30% for ordinary people. Two, the host gains one&#x27;s second talent awakening opportunity.</p>
<p>The voice in his mind instantly reversed Shun Yuans emotions. His breathing became rapid. He knew that his chance to change his fate had arrived. At this moment, standing before him was a target person who met the systems requirements. Chin Shua, the girl who had awakened an SSS level talent.</p>
<p>A bold plan quickly took shape in his mind. He wanted to win over Chinua, increase her affection for him, complete the newbie tasks issued by the system, and thus win the opportunity to awaken his talent a second time. Next, he will continuously seek out other women who meet his criteria, conquer them one by one, build a powerful herm team, and use the systems rewards to quickly improve his strength and rise to power in this cruel world. After calming himself down, Shinuan quickly ran down from the awakening platform and returned to the crowd. His gaze almost instinctively fell on Chinua.</p>
<p>Just then, Ziao Jingua and Li Yun, a couple from the largest civilian armed company in the East China Sea, and even the entire empire, came to the scene and took Shin Yuan and Shinui on the grounds that Shin Yuan&#x27;s talent was somewhat special. The train carriage was spacious, yet it seemed to be invisibly divided into two different worlds. On one side were Xiao Jingua and his wife Le Yun surrounding Chinua. Their words filled with boundless anticipation for the future. Chinua, don&#x27;t worry.</p>
<p>Once you arrive at the umbrella base, everything will be arranged to the highest standards. Although her majesty the Empress has a somewhat cold temper, she is always extremely kind to her own people. If you can become her disciple, your future will be limitless. Chin Schwa simply nodded, speaking very little and sparingly. Yet her calm and composed demeanor still delighted Xiao Jingua and his wife.</p>
<p>On the other side of the carriage, Shin Yuan sat alone in a corner, seemingly out of place amidst the hustle and bustle. Leaning against the window, he gazed at the city silhouettes rushing past, and the plan he had just drafted involuntarily surfaced in his mind. With his frrank talent, Chinua probably wouldn&#x27;t even give him a second glance. To win her over with personal charm and get her to willingly grant him good luck. That&#x27;s far more absurd than asking him to single-handedly fight a lordle star beast.</p>
<p>No, I absolutely can&#x27;t do it on my own. Shinuan quickly processed his thoughts. The rewards given by the good luck in succession system were simply too incredible. Gene potential enhancement potion. It could increase the probability of an ordinary person&#x27;s talent awakening by 30%.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means that capable awakened ones can be created in a continuous stream. And that other reward, the opportunity for a secondary talent awakening is his only hope to get rid of his F-rank useless talent. Fortune favors the bold. An incredibly audacious idea rapidly took shape in his mind. If he were to work alone, he&#x27;d probably be busy forever to complete the task.</p>
<p>But if you want to advance quickly, you have to find the strongest backer to cling to. Umbrella Corporation. Just hearing the name makes you think of the kind of company you can cling to tightly. The mag lev train traversed numerous checkpoints before finally stopping deep within a heavily guarded underground base. The metal doors opened, releasing a chilling and menacing aura.</p>
<p>Led by Ziao Jingua and his wife Shin Yuan and Shin Shu entered a secluded room devoid of any decoration. At the head of the table sat a kind-faced old man with white hair. He wore a simple gray Jehong Sean suit, exuding a reserved air like a kind grandfather next door. Beside him stood a tall, beautiful woman. Her crimson combat uniform accentuated her perfect curves, and her eyes flashed with a sharp, almost electric light, the exquisite war goddess.</p>
<p>As soon as Xiao Jingua and his wife entered, they respectfully bowed to the woman in red. She was none other than Yu Ling Long, one of the five pillars of the human race and the exquisite war goddess. Shin Yuans heart tightened suddenly. The person before him was a genuine powerhouse, standing at the very top of the pyramid. Yu Ling Longs gaze didn&#x27;t linger on anyone else, landing directly on Chinua, her sharp eyes instantly turning fiery.</p>
<p>Indeed, you are of Ice Phoenix bloodline with excellent potential. She made no attempt to hide her admiration and announced directly. By order of the empress, from this day forward, you will be my last disciple, Yu Ling Long. As soon as she finished speaking, she flicked her finger and a jade pendant radiating coldness flew towards Chinua. This is the ice heart jade, which can stabilize bloodlines and accelerate cultivation.</p>
<p>This book, The Profound Ice Nine Heavens Technique, is a cultivation method personally passed down by Her Majesty the Empress, and I bestow it upon you as well. Xiao Jingua and Li Yun stared wideeyed, their faces filled with envy. That was the ice heart jade, a priceless treasure. And there was also the profound ice nine heavens technique, a fundamental method personally taught by the empress. Chinu respectfully accepted the jade pendant and the cultivation manual, bowed, and said, &quot;Disciple Chin Schwe greets master.&quot; Yuing Long nodded in satisfaction and turned to leave.</p>
<p>Just as she turned around, Yuling Longs gaze finally landed on Shin Yuan. With just one glance, Shin Yuan felt as if the blood in his body had frozen. It was an absolute suppression from a higher level of life. Yuing Long said calmly, &quot;I&#x27;m taking Chinua with me. This is your company&#x27;s business.</p>
<p>You can make your own arrangements.&quot; After saying that, she left with Chinua without lingering. Shinuans heart sank. Sure enough, he was just a freebie to be picked up along with others. He was even prepared to face Chinu&#x27;s mocking or indifferent gaze. After all, not long ago, he had confessed his feelings to this prodigy.</p>
<p>Her answer at the time was both direct and realistic. If you can awaken your talent and defeat me in the prodigy battle a year from now, I will accept your proposal. He has awakened the most useless frank talent of good fortune in history. While she has awakened the SSS rank ice phoenix bloodline, soaring to new heights, the difference is like an insurmountable chasm. Shinuan&#x27;s fist clenched silently in his sleeve.</p>
<p>Just as Chinua was about to step out of the secret room, she suddenly stopped, turned her head slightly, and her clear, cold eyes finally landed on Shen Yuan. She looked at him calmly, her red lips parting slightly. The Battle of the Prodigies in a little over a month. I&#x27;ll be waiting for you there. With that, she turned and disappeared out the door with Yu Ling Long without looking back.</p>
<p>Shinyuan was completely stunned. Was this an insult or something else? Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, but they ultimately coalesed into an indescribable heat. He suddenly smiled. Whatever her meaning, it at least proved that in her heart, he wasn&#x27;t a completely transparent background figure. A battle of prodigies, is it good? In the secret room, only Shun Yuan, Xiao, Jingua, and his wife, and the white-haired old man with a constant smile remained.</p>
<p>Little one, were you frightened? The white-haired old man picked up his teacup, took a slow sip, and looked at Shin Yuan. That girl Ling Long, that&#x27;s just her temper. Ziao Jingwa quickly introduced, &quot;Shuan, this is ElderQin. His full name is Chin Jean, a ninth realm demagod titled Madslaughter.&quot; When Zhiao Jingua said these words, his tone was full of heartfelt respect. The title mad slaughterer was not self-proclaimed, but rather a fearsome name forged amidst mountains of corpses and seas of blood piled high with the bones of countless star beasts.</p>
<p>Shinjan possessed neither a distinguished family background nor top tier talent. He was the only rogue cultivator on blue star without any connections who had yet reached the pinnacle of power. Shinyuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat, and he immediately bowed respectfully. This seemingly ordinary old man who looked just like a chess player in a park was actually a legendary ninth realm demagod who could single-handedly annihilate a beast tide, and his strength was even above you Linglongs. Don&#x27;t be so reserved.</p>
<p>Sit down. Old Sheen gestured to the chair opposite him, his tone gentle. Shinwa has already told me about your matter. Shin Yuans heart tightened and he unconsciously rubbed his hands together knowing that the real show was about to begin. ElderQin, why did you call me here? ElderQin put down his teacup, a smile on his face, but said something that was enough to shake people&#x27;s hearts.</p>
<p>Young man, you may not know this. The stronger a martial artist is, the more doineering their gene chain becomes, and the more difficult it is to leave offspring. currently within the empire in the company, including myself, over 90% of the top experts have no offspring. Our high-end combat power is on the verge of extinction. He sighed softly.</p>
<p>Therefore, your talent is not wasted. Old Sheen&#x27;s words, &quot;Your talent is not wasted,&quot; struck Shinuan like a heavy hammer. But before he could even ponder the deeper meaning of those words, Old Sheen&#x27;s next action shocked everyone present. The approachable old man suddenly stood up, solemnly straightened his collar, and then bowed respectfully to the air. &quot;Little one, have you always felt that you have an innocent background, that you&#x27;re an orphan with no parents and a pitiful, helpless child?&quot; Old Sheen sat down again, his gaze fixed intently on Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan was taken aback, then nodded subconsciously. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that right?&quot; I grew up in an orphanage. It&#x27;s all clearly written in my file. Old Sheen chuckled softly, tapping his fingers on the mahogany tabletop with a deep, resonant sound. That thing, if I wanted, could forge a thousand unique files for you.</p>
<p>I could even package you as the illegitimate son of a space pirate. Shinuan&#x27;s lips twitched involuntarily. This old man looked kind and gentle, but his words carried a thuggish air. Shinuan, listen carefully. Old Chen&#x27;s smile vanished, and his deep brown eyes instantly became incredibly sharp.</p>
<p>An invisible pressure quietly spread out, and even the air seemed to freeze. Bringing you here was not a spur-of-the- moment decision by Jinua and me, nor was it simply for recruitment. Jingua and I are all members of the Umbrella Corporation. Our goal is simple. In an era ravaged by star beasts, to preserve the last spark of humanity and cultivate future strong men, Old Sheen explained calmly.</p>
<p>Every year, we search for promising talents during the awakening ceremonies in major base cities, recruit them into our ranks, provide them with the best resources to support their growth, and then hunt star beasts together to protect our home. Chinua is one of the targets we have chosen this time. But you are different. At this point, his tone suddenly became solemn, and he uttered a shocking sentence. Word by word.</p>
<p>Bringing you here was a secret order personally issued by her majesty, the Supreme Empress, from the depths of the universe. Boom! Shiny Yuan&#x27;s mind was struck as if by lightning, his thoughts instantly thrown into chaos. The Empress, that being who ruled the entire human realm, suppressed all races, and was revered as a god by countless beings. He was merely a nobody who had awakened an F-rank talent. How could he possibly catch the eye of such a being? Just before your awakening ceremony began, a top level encrypted communication directly cut into my private channel.</p>
<p>Old Sheen&#x27;s tone was low with an undisguised awe in his eyes. The empress&#x27;s exact words. On the day Shinuan awakens, immediately guide him and do everything in your power to protect him. If the East Sea is breached, abandon the company to save him. Xiao Jingua and Lie Yun were already sweating profusely.</p>
<p>Although they knew the mission was to pick someone up, they never imagined the order would be so harsh to abandon a super company with hundreds of thousands of martial artists and a complete system for one person. Just who was this Shinuan? Shinuan himself was completely stunned. He swallowed hard, pointed to his nose, and said, &quot;Elder Chin, you&#x27;re not joking, are you? You&#x27;re going to protect me.&quot; Old Sheen slowly shook his head, his gaze deep and unfathomable. &quot;I can&#x27;t find a single thing about your background. Before you turned 18, your file was a top secret document of the highest level, which I have no right to view.</p>
<p>But since it was the empress herself who gave the order, it means that you are burdened with karma that we cannot access.&quot; As he spoke, he leaned forward slightly, his previously kind, neighborly grandfather, demeanor vanishing instantly, replaced by a ruthless and indomitable aura, as if he had fought his way through mountains of corpses and seas of blood. So, Shinuan, from today onwards, Umbrella Corporation is your home. You only need to do one thing. Become stronger and then survive. Looking at the old man before him, Shin Yuan felt a long-lost warmth welling up in his heart.</p>
<p>But this was quickly followed by a profound sense of absurdity. He had intended to lie down and relax, but instead he had been unexpectedly struck by a powerful, unexpected benefactor. And this wasn&#x27;t just any ordinary benefactor. It was the kind of benefactor so powerful it seemed to reach the heavens. Since that&#x27;s the case, Shinuan took a deep breath.</p>
<p>His previously hunched back, straightening up a bit. The systems offer was already outstretched. Any further hesitation would be ungrateful. With the system task right in front of him, relying solely on his F-rank physique, completing the task and winning over the goddess seemed like a distant dream. Old Sheen, since you&#x27;ve put it this way, I won&#x27;t keep anything from you.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans usual nonchalant attitude faded somewhat, replaced by a firm and serious look in his eyes. Ziao Jingua and Lie Yun exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with curiosity. &quot;What secrets could this kid possibly have?&quot; The infallible luck displayed on the awakening platform is actually just a manifestation of my talent,&quot; Shin Yuan said without changing his expression, speaking nonsense with a straight face. Of course, he knew in his heart that this wasn&#x27;t lying. The system itself was part of his power.</p>
<p>What if I told you that my talent is far more powerful than you imagine? What if I told you that I can help more ordinary people awaken their talents? As soon as he finished speaking, Old Chin&#x27;s expression clearly froze. Xiao Jingwa and Le Yun also frowned. Shinuans words sounded rather exaggerated. Help ordinary people awaken their talents. How dare an F- level awakener make such a claim? However, Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t give them a chance to question.</p>
<p>He quickly focused his mind and issued a command to the system in his mind. Buzz, a pale blue virtual light screen, which only Shin Yuan and ElderQin could see, quietly appeared in front of ElderQ. The information displayed on the screen had been slightly beautified by Shun Yuan, making it appear to appropriately showcase the systems capabilities. Good luck galore. FF level talent grants good luck to a female character with a score of 95 or higher.</p>
<p>Mission rewards. One, gene potential enhancement potion recipe can increase the chance of talent awakening by 30% for ordinary people. Two, the host will receive one&#x27;s second talent awakening opportunity. The smile on Old Sheen&#x27;s face froze instantly, and shock and disbelief appeared in his eyes. The Celadone teacup slipped silently from his hand.</p>
<p>Crack! The teacup shattered on the hard floor, breaking into several pieces. The crisp sound of shattering was particularly jarring in the silent enclosed room. Ziao Jingua and Li Yun were startled, not daring to utter a sound. Even the most composed Ninth Realm demagod, ElderQin, who remained unmoved, even in the face of a collapsing mountain, had actually accidentally shattered his most beloved teacup. Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Lying flat, I clinged to a powerful figure. Old Sheen looked at Shan Yuan, his gaze shifting from amiable to sharp as a blade, as if trying to see through his entire secret. The atmosphere in the secret room instantly became heavy, an invisible pressure washing over Shun Yuan, making it difficult for him to even breathe. Jean serum, second awakening. Old Sheen slowly sat up straight, the smile on his face vanishing, replaced by the calm and authoritative demeanor of someone in a high position.</p>
<p>Words are meaningless. You need to provide evidence. Despite the overwhelming aura emanating from him, Shinuan secretly breathed a sigh of relief. This was exactly what he wanted to hear. Questioning was acceptable, but a direct rejection was not.</p>
<p>He forced a calm smile and spoke in a composed tone. &quot;Elder Chin, my good luck, actually has an additional ability. I can access some rather private information simply by touching a woman.&quot; He then turned his gaze to the icy face of Li Yun not far away. To verify my abilities and to ensure the authenticity of the confidential information, how about having Li Yun cooperate? Lie Yuns face darkened, her eyes turning icy as she stared directly at Shun Yuan, her aura overwhelming. Xiao Jingwa also frowned instinctively.</p>
<p>This kid was far too audacious. Wua Leun, you two stepped back. Old Sheen, however, didn&#x27;t get angry, but smiled, a hint of interest flashing in his eyes. Fine, I&#x27;d like to see what you can find out. Leons expression was complicated, but she finally extended her right hand.</p>
<p>Her hand was fair and slender, but there were faint calluses on the base of her thumb and the knuckles, clearly the marks of long-term training. All three eyes focused on each other, and Shinuan didn&#x27;t hesitate, gently touching the back of her hand with his finger. The moment his fingertips made contact, a blue light screen visible only to him appeared in his mind. Subject of investigation. Le Yun age 28.</p>
<p>Talent B-level strength amplification cultivation. Fifth Realm Grandmaster appearance rating 92. Figure rating 91. Status. Partner Xiao Jinga.</p>
<p>Number of investigations 3,000. Shin Yuans eye twitched slightly. This system was far too unreliable. He almost clicked the expand more option but ultimately steadied himself. Ahem.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and began his report. Le Yun, 28 years old. The three elders remained calm. This information could be found online. B-level power enhancement.</p>
<p>Fifth realm Grandmaster cultivation. Ziao Jingua and Lie Yun exchanged a glance, their eyes narrowing. Talent level was known to the outside world, but cultivation level was classified. Shin Yuan continued reading. Appearance score 92, figure score 91.</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, Lean&#x27;s expression changed visibly, and Shin Yuan immediately skipped over the rest of the detailed description. Overall score 92. The air suddenly fell silent. A scoring system? What nonsense? Xiao Jingua looked completely bewildered while Leans face turned from white to red, filled with shame and indignation. Just as everyone was wondering, Shin Yuans expression changed and he unleashed his final devastating blow.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s one last piece of information. He deliberately dragged out his words, his expression turning strange. Number of times, 3,000. Number of times. Old Chin didn&#x27;t immediately understand what that meant.</p>
<p>But Xiao Jingua and Lie Yuns expressions changed drastically, almost simultaneously, turning bright red, especially Li Yun, whose face instantly flushed crimson. Her eyes fixed intently on Shin Yuan. Shinyuan glanced at the system panel, clicked on the question mark next to a number of times, and an explanation note immediately popped up. Note refers to the number of times with a partner. It&#x27;s an important reference for measuring emotional and physical qualities.</p>
<p>Shinyuan coughed lightly, forcing himself to remain calm. Judging from the feedback from my talent, this number seems to be some kind of data related to marital relations. Xiaoing nearly choked and fainted. Le Yun was so ashamed she didn&#x27;t want to live anymore. She must be crazy to believe that someone else would know about this.</p>
<p>At that moment, however, old Sheen was suddenly jolted, his eyes filled with unusual excitement. He completely ignored their awkwardness and turned to asking, &quot;How long have you been married?&quot; Zhiaoings face turned red, but he still answered honestly, &quot;3 years and 2 months.&quot; Old Sheen&#x27;s eyes narrowed, and a strange light flashed in them. He immediately asked the crucial question, &quot;Is this true?&quot; Xiao Jingwa and Li Yun exchanged glances for a moment and finally nodded simultaneously under Old Chin&#x27;s gaze. That&#x27;s right. Last night was the anniversary of their third breakthrough of a thousand times.</p>
<p>They had never mentioned this information to anyone. How did Shinuan know? Good. Good. Haha. Old Sheen suddenly stood up with a loud laugh, slamming his hand heavily on the alloy tabletop with a deafening bang.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all real. This ability is actually real. His laughter was filled with joy and relief, as well as a release that had been suppressed for a long time. Xiao Jingua and Li Yun were completely bewildered, unable to keep up at all. They then realized that ElderQin&#x27;s verification was actually to confirm the ability Shinuan had mentioned.</p>
<p>Could this kid&#x27;s F-level talent really be extraordinary? Just as the two were still processing this astonishing fact, Old Sheen suddenly rushed forward and grabbed Shinuan&#x27;s shoulder. child, what do you want? Our umbrella corporation is willing to fully support you. Shinyuan was shaken until he was dizzy, but he was already overjoyed inside. You ask me what I want. Of course, I want nothing and then you can give it all to me.</p>
<p>He feigned an indifference to fame and fortune as if money were dirt. Old Sheen, I ask for nothing. He raised his head, his voice firm. I, Shin Yuan, am willing to wholeheartedly obey the arrangements of the Umbrella Corporation without any complaints. Xiao Jingua and Lie Yun were both stunned.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, wasn&#x27;t this guy terrified, saying he didn&#x27;t want to be dissected? And now he&#x27;s a hot-blooded warrior. Old Sheen, on the other hand, was filled with satisfaction. The more he looked at Shu Yuan, the more he felt he was a treasure. Talented yet not arrogant and so loyal. He&#x27;s the company&#x27;s most valuable asset.</p>
<p>Chapter 5. Buying the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s fortress. Payment successful. The air in the secret room seemed to freeze for half a second before being broken by Old Sheen&#x27;s hearty laughter echoing in every corner. Good.</p>
<p>Good. His eyes were full of intense praise. As if he had found a ray of hope for the future, and he was extremely gratified. He pulled out a dark, heavy-l looking jade pendant from his pocket. It was carved with a coiled dragon, and a faint light shimmerred in the dragon&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Even a layman would know that this jade pendant was no ordinary item. Without a word, he casually hung the jade pendant around Shin Yuan&#x27;s neck as if giving him an ordinary ornament. Dragon soul jade. This old man has worn it for 60 years. He said it lightly, but his tone revealed something unusual.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not very useful. It can only block all attacks from those below the fifth realm Grandmaster. Shin Yuan nearly threw the jade pendant away. His hands were trembling. This was called not very useful.</p>
<p>Did that mean he could live several more lives? Before he could recover from this wave of surprise, old Sheen pulled out a black card and stuffed it into his hand. The card had no number or logo, only a faint golden dragon pattern. It looked understated yet luxurious and felt inexplicably heavy. &quot;The dragon card,&quot; his majesty specifically instructed me to use it,&quot; Elder Cheen said in a low voice, his tone tinged with a mischievous joking. It&#x27;s her private stash of money from the treasury, and there&#x27;s no limit to the amount.</p>
<p>Feel free to use it. Don&#x27;t be shy about buying anything on Earth. Shinyuan stared at the card, feeling a bit giddy. Was this the joy of being a kept man and doing it with such self-righteousness? Old Chin patted him on the shoulder, his expression turning serious. With Jingua and Li Yun and Don Hai, I&#x27;m at ease.</p>
<p>You only need to remember one thing. Live. How to live. What to do is up to you. After speaking, Old Sheen turned and left, leaving the three of them awkwardly staring at each other.</p>
<p>A moment of silence filled the secret room, the atmosphere so subtly amusing it was almost comical. Ziao Jingua looked at Shin Yuan with a complex expression as if he hadn&#x27;t yet recovered from his recent social death. Lie Yun turned her head away, her face still slightly flushed. At this moment, Shinuan weighed the dragon card in his hand, then suddenly turned to Xiao Jingua and asked, &quot;Seriously,&quot; &quot;Brother Xiao, does our company sell houses?&quot; Ziao Jingua spat out the water he had just drunk, coughing until his face turned red. &quot;What did you say?&quot; Lean also turned her head sharply, looking at him with a shocked expression as if she had seen some monster.</p>
<p>&quot;The Umbrella Corporation is a top tier fighting fortress in the civilian world, not some real estate company.&quot; Shun Yuan argued confidently, waving the card as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Old Sheen said, &quot;My mission is to survive. Staying safe is the top priority. This secret room is nice, but we can&#x27;t live here forever, can we? I don&#x27;t trust the accommodations you&#x27;ve arranged. I want to buy my own house.</p>
<p>Right here in the Umbrella headquarters, the most secure and safest kind, where no one can break in.&quot; Lie Yun was momentarily speechless at his words, while Xiao Jing was lips twitched. They&#x27;d met many geniuses. Some wanted weapons, some wanted secret manuals, some wanted the blood of divine beasts. But this guy, who immediately asked, &quot;Are you selling your house,&quot; was truly a first. The key point was that what he said actually made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Ziao Jingua sighed and explained, &quot;The houses within the base are not for sale in principle. They are only allocated to core high-ranking officials.&quot; &quot;Then am I not a core member now?&quot; Shinuan retorted, his tone serious. Ziaoin was speechless with his majesty&#x27;s secret order, Elder Chin&#x27;s jade pendant, and the black card in hand. If he&#x27;s not a core member, then who is? He paused for a moment before finally saying, &quot;Yes, there is one.&quot; In the core area of the base, there is fortress number one, which was originally the company founder&#x27;s refuge. The alloy walls are 10 m thick and have their own independent energy system capable of withstanding a full force attack from a ninth realm expert.</p>
<p>Shinyuans eyes lit up and he immediately slapped his thigh. That&#x27;s it. How much? I&#x27;ll buy it. Ziao Xing Wu was practically going crazy. That&#x27;s a strategic asset.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s never been sold to outsiders before. Name your price. Shin Yuan handed over the dragon card, saying casually, &quot;Is my personal savings enough?&quot; Xiao Jingua stared at the card, his throat dry and his heart skipping a beat. He gritted his teeth, dialed the internal communication, and after a low growl, managed to utter an astronomical figure. 300 billion credit points.</p>
<p>He then stared intently at Shin Yuan, trying to see if he would show any shock. Shinuan simply gave a curt, &quot;Oh,&quot; and held up the card, &quot;Swipe card!&quot; Xiaoing froze completely, taking the card with trembling hands. He gently swiped it across the terminal. Beep! Payment successful. The moment the electronic voice rang out, Xiao Jingua and Lie Yun froze on the spot.</p>
<p>Their expressions shifting from surprise to bewilderment and then to blankness. They finally understood this wasn&#x27;t recruiting a genius. This was bringing back a walking talking super rich patron. Just then, there was a knock on the door of the secret room and a special forces team in black entered. The captain at the head of the team gave a crisp military salute.</p>
<p>Mr. Shan, the transfer of ownership of fortress number one has been completed. Please come with us for inspection. Chapter 6. A Lind Dau falls from the sky.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan was escorted out of the secret room by a special forces team. Along the way, he passed through multiple layers of security, and each door required dual verification of his iris and jeans, making the security level ridiculously high. Only after passing through the last heavy alloy gate did he finally arrive at the so-called fortress number one. Mr. Shawn, this is your private residence.</p>
<p>The special forces captain personally opened the last door for him, his tone filled with undisguised respect and envy. The door slowly slid open, revealing to Shun Yuan not a cold steel space, but a minimalist yet extremely luxurious technological residence. Instead of carpet, the floor is made of a warm jade-like material that feels like walking on clouds. Light yet grounding. The fortress is predominantly milky white with blue skies and white clouds projected from the ceiling and the lighting automatically adjusts according to the time and temperature.</p>
<p>The interior lacks traditional partitions. All functional areas are divided by light and shadow projections and retractable smart walls, a highly advanced design. The living room, bedroom, and meditation room are integrated into one spacious and airy environment with smart touch panels emitting floating blue light throughout. The fortress&#x27;s daily needs are managed by the intelligent AI. Friday, all ingredients are of the highest quality and specially supplied.</p>
<p>If needed, just wake it up. The special forces soldier saluted and retreated to the door. Shinyuan closed the door alone, and the entire space instantly became silent. He put down his backpack and wandered around the room as excited as a child opening a blind box until he saw the large bathtub carved from warm jade in the bathroom. The pipes connected to it flowed with diluted spiritual liquid which could not only be used for bathing but also nourish the body.</p>
<p>How luxurious. Shin Yuan sighed as he laid down in the spiritual liquid. Closing his eyes contentedly as if he were finally truly living. He chewed on a crimson flame fruit, a bloodnourishing spiritual fruit stored in the refrigerator. One bite warmed his entire body.</p>
<p>He chewed while toying with the black dragon card, its edges gleaming coldly in the light. unlimited funds, a private stash bestowed by the empress herself. Truly a top tier existence. However, he quickly thought of the system task to find a suitable target. Should he send the Umbrella Corporation to find one? Shin Yuan shook his head, immediately rejecting the idea.</p>
<p>Those people were strong in combat, but their aesthetic sense might mislead him. He didn&#x27;t even want to think about sending a few muscular women. Instead of asking others for help, I&#x27;d rather handle it myself. Shin Yuan got out of the bathtub, wrapped a towel around his neck, and walked across the warm floor to the arched French window. The window wasn&#x27;t made of glass, but was a single high-end virtual reality screen reflecting the night view of Donghai City with neon lights flashing like a flowing galaxy.</p>
<p>Friday, he called softly and a gentle neutral electronic voice immediately filled the room. Sir, what can I do for you? Contact the top headunting firm in Donghai City or a socialite club. I need to hire 10 personal assistants aged 18 to 24 with decent looks and clean backgrounds. Regardless of whether they are hired or not, each person will be paid 50,000 yuan for travel expenses up front, Shinuan said calmly. For hours later, the fortress gates sounded and 10 women of different styles lined up to enter.</p>
<p>Leun even personally led the group through the security check. Shinuan changed into a loose silk robe and lazily sat on the floating sofa in the center. On the coffee table were black dragon cards and a pile of cash transferred from the bank stacked into a small bright red mountain. Let them in. 10 women filed in each with a different makeup style and distinct temperament immediately filling the air with a strong scent of perfume.</p>
<p>They looked at Shun Yuan, then glanced at the banknotes on the coffee table, their eyes burning with undisguised desire. Relax,&quot; Shinuan said calmly, picking up his glass of red wine. &quot;Ill judge them by appearance and fortune. Those who catch my eye can stay, and those who take the money and leave can go.&quot; He walked to the first woman, who, dressed in a red dress, gave him a flirtatious wink. Her makeup was as exquisite as a stage stars.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan lightly tapped the back of her hand, and a system panel popped up with information. Wong Lily, 22 years old, appearance score 75. Excessive plastic surgery, inferior jeans, not recommended. He twitched his lips and unhesitatingly tossed out a watt of cash. Travel expenses.</p>
<p>Next one. The second person was a woman in workout clothes with clearly defined muscles. Zhao Chiian, 25 years old. Appearance score 88. Body score 93.</p>
<p>Number of attempts 1588. Suggestion fitness interaction. Shin Yuans eyelids twitched and he coughed lightly. You can go down too. In the blink of an eye, all nine people had been screamed and Shin Yuans expression had changed from expectation to disappointment.</p>
<p>These high-end standards are too lax. Just as he was about to give up, his gaze fell on the last girl. She was wearing a faded blue dress and worn out canvas shoes, standing far back like a little rabbit, ready to run away at any moment. She was clutching the hem of her dress, her head bowed, her whole body trembling with nervousness, huddled in the shadows. Shinyuan&#x27;s heart stirred slightly, he slowly walked up to her and said softly, &quot;Lift your head.&quot; The girl looked up, revealing a face that was naturally beautiful, yet breathtakingly so.</p>
<p>Her eyes were slightly red, and her expression was timid. Shin yuan gently touched the back of her hand, and a screen of light appeared. Lynn Sharon 19 years old appearance 95 figure 97 naturally beautiful without any editing state pure background former ays of the Lynn group her family was destroyed 3 years ago leaving her heavily in debt suggestion intervene with a protective stance to increase favorability shiny heart skipped a beat wasn&#x27;t this the person he was looking for the system hadn&#x27;t lied after all chapter 7 a date with Lin Sharon Umbrella Corporation Shinyuan Juan was overjoyed. He immediately looked at the manager who had led the team, his voice crisp and decisive. The rest of you can leave.</p>
<p>He casually grabbed a few stacks of cash and tossed them to the unselected women, but his finger pointed steadily at Lin Sharon. You stay. Soon, only the two of them remained in the large living room, and the air suddenly became silent and awkward. Lynn Sharon stood there like a small statue, motionless, neither daring to move forward nor backward. She looked down at Shun Yuan, and tears finally welled up in her eyes, rolling down her cheeks and dripping onto the floor.</p>
<p>She knew what staying meant. The manager had made it clear. If she was chosen, she would receive a huge sum of money, enough to solve all her problems. She could pay off the lone sharks and save the old house her parents had left her. But what about her dignity? She bit her lip hard until she tasted blood.</p>
<p>Looking at her, ready to die expression, Shinuan couldn&#x27;t help but rub his forehead. He wasn&#x27;t a monster, and he wasn&#x27;t exactly scaryl looking, was he? He walked back to the sofa, picked up the kettle, poured a glass of warm water, and pointed to the sofa opposite him. Sit! Lynn Char didn&#x27;t move, remaining frozen in place, as if she were rooted to the spot. &quot;What? Afraid I&#x27;ll eat you?&quot; Shinuan chuckled, trying to sound easygoing. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like forcing people, especially girls who are crying.&quot; Lynch sobbed slightly, hesitated for a moment, then carefully moved to the edge of the sofa, sitting only on the corner. She crossed her arms over her chest, looking at him wearily, &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot; Shin Yuan pretended not to know and asked casually, &quot;Lin Sharon.&quot; Her voice was so soft, it was almost inaudible, like a mosquito&#x27;s hum. &quot;Do you know why you&#x27;re here?&quot; Shin Yuan continued. Lynn Sharons face instantly flushed red, a wave of shame washing over her. She lowered her head, her lips trembling.</p>
<p>To be a personal assistant. I&#x27;ll do anything for money. The last few words were barely audible. Anything. Shinuan raised an eyebrow, leaning forward.</p>
<p>How about having my baby? Lyn Sharon looked up abruptly, her face filled with shock and disbelief. She had thought it would be just to keep him company at most, but having a baby? She wasn&#x27;t prepared at all. Unwilling, Shin Yuan leaned back on the sofa, picking up the dragon card and twirling it casually. Then you can leave. The door&#x27;s over there and the 50,000 yuan travel expenses will still be paid.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the words leave, Lynn Charn&#x27;s body visibly trembled, her fingertips shaking slightly. 50,000, not even enough to cover this month&#x27;s interest. If she didn&#x27;t get the money tonight, the creditors would come and demolish the house tomorrow, throwing all her parents&#x27; belongings onto the street. She had no choice. I&#x27;m willing.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face again, her voice trembling softly. She reached out, her hands trembling to unbutton her clothes. Hey, stop. Stop. Shinuan quickly stood up and shouted, &quot;What are you doing? Who told you to take your clothes off?&quot; This girl was too honest.</p>
<p>He was just asking, not telling her to get down to business. Although, he was also quite interested in watching. If he messed up the systems favorability mechanism and the mission failed, wouldn&#x27;t he be at a huge loss? Put your clothes on properly. Shinyuan sighed, looking disgusted. I&#x27;m not the kind of person who forces people to do things against their will.</p>
<p>I value mutual affection. Understand? Lynn Sharon stared at him blankly, somewhat confused about what this wealthy man was trying to do. Shin Yuan waved the dragon card in his hand, his tone slightly somber. Lynn Sharon, I know you&#x27;re short of money. I know everything about your parents&#x27; old house, your debts, and the Lynn group.</p>
<p>Hearing Lynn Group, Lynn Sharon suddenly became alert. her eyes instantly turning defensive. Don&#x27;t be nervous. I&#x27;m not a bad person. Shinyuan walked over and lowered his voice.</p>
<p>I can help you. I can help you pay off your debts, save the old house, and even take back everything you&#x27;ve lost. Lynn Char&#x27;s eyes widened, unable to believe her ears. I only want one thing from you. Shinuan reached out and gently wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>Try to fall in love with me or cooperate with me and have a relationship. Lynn Sharon was stunned, completely dumbfounded. Dating, paying off hundreds of millions in debt just to date? Was this man crazy? Wipe your tears, Shinuan said, pulling her up, his eyes serious. Come with me. Where to? Lynch asked instinctively.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan turned and smiled, revealing a set of perfectly white teeth. To create some romance, of course. A relationship always needs a sense of ritual. A magv car smoothly pulled up in front of the VIP entrance to Star Dream Park, Shinuan got out, bent down to straighten his casual clothes worth hundreds of thousands. Still feeling a little uncomfortable, he felt like he was on a special operations mission, cenamed Heartbreaker, and his target was standing quietly by the carousel railing.</p>
<p>Lynn Chur, she stood there in a pale purple butterfly patterned gauze dress, light and flowing like a dream. The hem of the dress swayed gently, revealing a pair of long, straight legs that appeared as white as snow in the sunlight. Sunlight filtered through the branches and leaves, casting a halo of light upon her, making her seem as if she had stepped out of a fairy tale. Her face was pure and clean, without a trace of makeup, yet as clear and translucent as the first snow in the mountains. Breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Regardless of gender, passers by couldn&#x27;t help but glance at her. Even arguing couples would instantly stop the man from speaking and children would cease their crying, pointing at her and calling her fairy sister. It was a pure unadulterated admiration, a natural yearning for beauty. She clutched the hem of her skirt tightly with her left hand, her right hand pressed against her chest, looking extremely nervous. This awkward posture, ironically, accentuated the stunning curves of her figure.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart felt as if it were being gripped by an invisible hand, his breath catching in his throat. He admitted that when he first saw the systems rating, he had only considered Lin Churin as a mission objective. But now, this blushing, nervous girl stood before him, his usually hardened heart suddenly softened. A mission was a mission, but a person was a person. He walked towards her, his steps slow but firm.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon heard footsteps and timidly looked up. When she saw it was Shun Yuan, a flicker of panic crossed her eyes and a blush instantly spread across her cheeks. Shin Yuan stopped in front of her, revealing a smile as gentle as possible. He didn&#x27;t rush to speak, but simply gazed at her quietly. In his mind, he silently recited, &quot;System, investigate.</p>
<p>Target: Lynn Sharon, current favorability 60. Initial nervousness and curiosity 60 points. Not bad, but not terrible either.&quot; Shinuan made up his mind and before she could react, reached out and gently took her cold right hand that was resting on her chest. Let&#x27;s go. Didn&#x27;t you want to ride the carousel? Lynn Chars body trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Her first instinct being to pull her hand away. But Shin Yuan&#x27;s grip was just right. Neither too tight nor too loose, neither offensive nor impossible to break free from. She tried several times but couldn&#x27;t pull away and finally had no choice but to let him lead her towards that dreamlike world of interwoven lights. Accompanied by light music, the carousel slowly started moving.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan insisted that the two of them ride together on an exquisitely decorated white horse with Lin Char in front and him behind. Very close. He could smell the faint fragrance of shampoo in her hair and feel the subtle stiffness and trembling in her body. The atmosphere suddenly became quiet and delicate. Just then, two couples were sitting on two wooden horses nearby.</p>
<p>One man wrapped his arms around his female companion from behind, resting his chin gently on her shoulder, whispering, &quot;Sweet nothings.&quot; The other was even more direct, his arms around the girl&#x27;s waist, laughing heartily in rhythm with the music. Shin Yuans eye twitched, and he silently cursed inwardly. &quot;They&#x27;ve even arranged a live lesson. These umbrella agents are too professional.&quot; He hesitated for a second, then followed suit, wrapping his arms around Lin Char from behind to gently hug her. The moment they touched, he felt the soft, warm body of the young woman in his arms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his hand went a little too high, touching a spot he shouldn&#x27;t have. Lynn Sharon&#x27;s body instantly stiffened, her face flushing crimson to the roots of her neck. She quickly pressed both hands against the back of Shun Yuan&#x27;s hands as if she had been electrocuted and dared not let go. Only after confirming he wasn&#x27;t moving again did she carefully lean back, her back pressed against his firm chest. Shin Yuans heart pounded.</p>
<p>He felt like he was holding a ball of fire. Just as he was about to adjust his hand position, he noticed the two couples beside him looking at him with strange expressions. One of them secretly pointed to his stomach, then to Shun Yuan&#x27;s hand, mouthing two words. Waist. Waist.</p>
<p>He instantly understood. His hand was too high. It was over the line. Shiny Yuan quickly tried to put his hand back down, but the direction of his movement was wrong. It went upwards.</p>
<p>As a result, the back of his hand solidly went up another inch. &quot;Ah!&quot; Lyncharin let out a very soft gasp, pressing his hand down tightly with both hands, her face burning like a cooked shrimp. &quot;Don&#x27;t move! This is outside,&quot; she said in a pitifully soft voice, almost fainting from embarrassment. Shin yuan froze, completely still, as if he had become a wooden sculpture. The two couples were also stunned, clearly not expecting the plot to fall apart, and they all turned to look at the sky, pretending to admire the ceiling.</p>
<p>A nearby passerby, agent whispered through his earpiece, calling Hawkeye. Target has deviated from the planned trajectory. He&#x27;s entered sector C. Hawkeye. Okay.</p>
<p>Damn, I saw it, too. Did he hold the training manual upside down? Captain, this mission is harder than hunting Cberus. This isn&#x27;t a mission. It&#x27;s a test of our psychological limits. Shin Yuan inwardly groaned.</p>
<p>He used to be a complete weakling, but now this was a social disaster. If he continued with this kind of skill, he&#x27;d probably turn his 95 points of goodwill into a negative 95. So, he gave up on physical actions and started trying to ease the awkwardness with words. He chatted softly with Lin Char about the weather, asked her what she liked to do, and even mentioned some interesting things at school. His voice was gentle, the conversation light, and there wasn&#x27;t a single idle word.</p>
<p>Gradually, Lynn Chur began to respond. Although her voice was still soft, her mood had clearly relaxed. As the last piece of music from the carousel began to play, the horse slowly came to a stop. Shin Yuan carefully helped Lin Char, whose legs were clearly a little weak. Off the horse.</p>
<p>Just then, a system notifications sounded in his mind. Ding. Targets favorability plus 5. Current favorability 65. A smile crept onto Shun Yuan&#x27;s lips.</p>
<p>There was hope. There really was hope. Chapter 8. Nourished by Dragon Chi, upgrading talent. The next challenge is the legendary haunted house.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan and Lin Char stood before the eerie entrance from which piercing screams echoed intermittently. &quot;Lin Charuns face turned pale, her hands gripping Shu Yuans clothes tightly, her strength increasing with each passing moment.&quot; &quot;Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t go,&quot; she said timidly in a low voice. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m here.&quot; Shin Yuan patted his chest, showing a man&#x27;s got to step up attitude, and then took her hand and walked inside. The haunted house was pitch black with gusts of cold wind and a damp, decaying smell. Lynch was so frightened that she didn&#x27;t dare to open her eyes.</p>
<p>She practically clung to Shun Yuan, staying close to him every step of the way. Just as the two turned a dark corner, a disheveled female ghost with distorted features suddenly lunged at them. Lynch&#x27;s scream was deafening, scaring Shin Yuan so much that he cowered in fear and curled up into a ball. Without thinking, she snuggled into Shun Yuans arms, her arms wrapped around his waist, her body trembling uncontrollably. Shin Yuans head buzzed, and he felt as if he had been struck by lightning.</p>
<p>Holding such a warm and soft body in his arms, he instantly wondered if he had secretly made a wish that had now come true. He gently patted her back, leaned close to her ear, and softly comforted her. Don&#x27;t be afraid. It&#x27;s fake. It&#x27;s all an act.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon still buried her face in his chest, clearly not daring to look, her body slowly relaxing, but still pressed tightly against him. Just as Shun Yuan was thinking of making a final push and taking the opportunity to throw in a few sweet words to score points, he glanced to his right and was immediately startled. A pale, distorted face floated in midair, blood streaming from its seven orififices, staring blankly at him. Shin Yuans heart skipped a beat and his face turned green. A ghost.</p>
<p>A pure traditional Chinese phrase escaped his lips. He reacted quickly, grabbing Lin Char and running for his life. A ghost. Run. Though he claimed to be protecting her, he was actually the first to rush out, running even faster than Lynch.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s another passage over there. An employee dressed as a zombie reached out to warn him, only to be nearly knocked over by the gust of wind he created. Meanwhile, in the monitoring room of Umbrella Corporation headquarters, Lean stared intently at the two figures fleeing with their heads and their hands on the screen, falling into a long silence. She rubbed her temples, finally sighed, and picked up her headset. Listen up, everyone who&#x27;s getting paid.</p>
<p>Haunted house courage booster plan C three has failed. Immediately activate backup plan F7, the gaming expert romance side quest. Everyone, wake up. This is harder than hunting Cberus. Outside the haunted house, Shinuan leaned against the wall, panting heavily, his face even more ashen than the hanged ghost from before.</p>
<p>It took him a long time to calm down when he heard a suppressed chuckle beside him. He turned his head and saw Lynn Sharon covering her mouth, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably, her eyes glistening with laughter. Her smile was like a crescent moon. Two dimples appearing and disappearing on her cheeks. Pure and captivating.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re afraid of ghosts, too? Of course. Who wouldn&#x27;t be afraid of someone so ugly? Shiny Yuan retorted stubbornly. That&#x27;s not fear. It&#x27;s the natural human aversion to ugliness. Lynch couldn&#x27;t help but laugh even harder at his force composure.</p>
<p>I was protecting you. Don&#x27;t you understand tactical retreat. Oh, I see. Lynn Sharon replied, her eyes full of teasing. In that instant, Shin Yuan felt all the embarrassment was worth it.</p>
<p>Ding! Targets favorability plus 10. Current favorability 75. The system notification startled him, so sincere awkwardness could actually gain favor. Sure enough, this unexpected mishap at the haunted house shattered the barrier between them. Afterwards, they went on bumper cars.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s skills were terrible, but he still managed to corner Lynch, making her laugh so hard she stomped her feet. At the ring toss booth, Shin Yuan immediately threw in 100 Yuan, tossing 99 rings without even getting a toothpick on the ring. Just as he was about to give up, a burly man happened to walk by and bumped into him. Shin Yuan&#x27;s hand jerked, and the last ring traced a perfect ark, instantly tossing the grand prize, a giant plush bear. The booth owner was stunned, applause erupted, and cheers from the tourists continued.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan handed the teddy bear, almost taller than himself, to Lin Chur, feeling like he was floating on air. Ding! Targets favorability plus three, current favorability 78. Night fell, the amusement park lights shone brightly, and the two walked side by side in the plaza. Lynch held the giant bear in her arms, a happy smile she had never worn before radiating from her as if she were enveloped in happiness. Several other couples nearby waited quietly and the atmosphere gradually heated up.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t. The clock tower struck 11:00 and suddenly dazzling fireworks burst across the night sky. One after another, they felt like a meteor shower as if lit just for the two of them. Lynch looked up at the starry sky, her eyes gradually welling up with tears. All the repression, grievances, and pain of the past 3 years seemed to be completely washed away in this dreamlike fireworks display.</p>
<p>The couples around her began to embrace and kiss, pushing the romantic atmosphere to its peak. Shinuan turned his head to look at the girl beside him. Lynch also turned her head at the same time, and their eyes met under the fireworks. The world seemed to stand still for a moment. He gently raised his hand to wipe away the tears on her face, feeling her warm skin.</p>
<p>Without further hesitation, he slowly lowered his head and gently kissed her lips. Lynch closed her eyes, her long eyelashes trembling slightly. Fireworks exploded overhead as they silently embraced and kissed as if the entire park existed solely for them. Ding. Targets favorability plus three.</p>
<p>Current favorability 81. Minimum requirements for the mission met. The system notification sounded, but Shin Yuan paid no attention. At this moment, his world consisted only of the girl before him. Chapter nine.</p>
<p>Having consumed Lin Churin, nourished by dragon energy. The Maglev train silently entered the underground hub of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters and came to a smooth stop in front of the exclusive passage. At the entrance of the passage, Leun had been waiting for a long time. She had changed into a smart and neat black suit. Her long hair was tied up, her aura was powerful, her eyes were calm, and her posture was composed.</p>
<p>But when she saw Shinuan get out of the car, a slight smile appeared on her lips, and she couldn&#x27;t hide the mischievous glint in her eyes. She subtly gestured with her chin towards him as if silently saying, &quot;Kid, not bad. You&#x27;ve got something.&quot; Then she turned to the nervous Lin Chur, her tone instantly softening like a gentle neighbor. &quot;Charin, don&#x27;t be nervous. Just think of it as coming home.</p>
<p>This seemingly ordinary sentence was full of profound meaning. Lynn Sharons ears turned bright red, her cheeks practically sizzling with embarrassment. She buried her face in the large teddy bear she was holding. Too ashamed to look up, Shin Yuan understood, a strange restlessness and anticipation rising within him. Lean led them to the heavy alloy gate, Fortress One.</p>
<p>Shinuan was already familiar with this gate, but its meaning today was clearly different. All right, I&#x27;ll stop here. Lie Yun smiled meaningfully and stuffed a gray silver card into Shun Yuans hand. A visitor pass, a spare. She paused, glanced at Lin Charuns blushing expression, and added, &quot;The room has everything you need.</p>
<p>If you need more, just have the robot apply for it.&quot; As soon as she finished speaking, she turned and left, her steps firm, her high heels clicking as she walked away. The alloy door closed slowly behind them with a dull click. In that instant, the outside world&#x27;s clamor was shut out, leaving only the two of them inside the fortress. The air instantly became quiet and ambiguous. The temperature seemingly rising slightly.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the city lights shimmerred, a dazzling spectacle, their cascading light pouring into the room like a galaxy. Inside, the lighting adjusted by Friday to its softest, warmest gold, bathed the two in a dreamlike glow. Lynn Sharon still clutched the large plush bear tightly, one hand unconsciously clutching the hem of her skirt. Her cheeks flushed crimson. Her heart was pounding wildly.</p>
<p>She knew nothing was certain, yet she couldn&#x27;t control her nervousness. This was the first time she had been alone in a room with a man. Shinuan didn&#x27;t speak immediately. He simply took off his coat and casually draped it over the sofa, then walked to the window, turning his back to her to gaze at the night view. His posture was effortless, yet his aura subtly enveloped the entire space.</p>
<p>He was putting on an act. Inwardly, he was exploding with excitement. After all, he lacked experience, and this was, frankly, his first time in such a situation. He could only maintain this mysterious aura through silence. Silently buying himself some time to cool down.</p>
<p>But this silence only made Lynn Churn more uneasy. The boy in front of her, who had been somewhat clumsy and shy during the day, now seemed to have shed his disguise, becoming calm and dangerous. When Shun Yuan finally turned around, his gaze held a hint of aggression that he himself was unaware of. Lynn Sharon felt flustered by his gaze and reflexively took a half step back only to bump into the cold door. Ah! A soft gasp escaped her lips.</p>
<p>Shinyuan strode forward and scooped her up, bare and all, in his arms. The movement was swift and decisive without warning. &quot;The bear was in the way,&quot; he said, a smile playing on his lips, but a hint of mischief in his voice. Lynch&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. She was completely stunned.</p>
<p>The plush bear landed with a thud on the carpet, and she, exposed in his arms, had nowhere to hide. The butterfly patterned tool skirt rolled up slightly, revealing her snow white thighs, making her appear as if she were under a spotlight. Shin Yuan looked into her clear eyes, which seemed to reflect the stars, and at her face, which was flushed with embarrassment and almost crying, soft, pure, and alluring. And her figure, enhanced by this level talent, was simply unfair. Chu ran, he whispered her name.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid. From now on, I&#x27;ll be your support. These words, like a key, quietly unlocked the long sealed lock in her heart. support. That was the word she had longed for most, yet could never have for the past 3 years.</p>
<p>Lyn Shu Ran nodded gently, tears sliding down her cheeks like dew drops falling into the deep sea. She softly responded with a barely audible yet as heavy as a thousand lbs. Under the cover of night, the lights of Dong Hai City flowed like a river. The ceiling was adorned with silhouettes of lights cast by windows. Lynn Sharon slept soundly in his arms, her small hands still clutching his clothes like a cat afraid of being abandoned.</p>
<p>A smile played on her lips. She slept peacefully and contentedly. Shin Yuan looked down at the sleeping girl in his arms, a tenderness striking accord within him. At that moment, he even forgot he was a mission executive, forgot about the system and the favorability rating. He gently adjusted her position to make her more comfortable.</p>
<p>Then, with a thought, he brought up the system panel in his mind. The next second, a golden notification popped up, almost blindingly bright. Ding detected that the host has completed their first task. The hidden talent, Dragon Chi Nourishment, has been activated. Shinyuan&#x27;s pupils contracted.</p>
<p>A hidden talent. He immediately checked the detailed description below. Dragon chi nourishment. The host body contains special dragon chi. Each deep contact allows a portion of the dragon chi to dissipate, nourishing the targets gene chain.</p>
<p>effect. Extremely low probability of activating the talent or increasing the targets existing talent level. Shinuan almost stopped breathing. This this is too heaven defying. Not only can she develop while lying down, but she can also carry others to victory.</p>
<p>He looked down at Lin Char sleeping peacefully in his arms. If she continues to be nurtured, could she go from no talent to a S or even SSS? This is simply a bug-like talent for targeted cultivation of top geniuses. Chapter 10. Leaving with the support of the wall, a female instructor is needed. The next morning, sunlight peers through the high altitude clouds and poured into the fortress, casting a golden ribbon of light on the white carpet.</p>
<p>Shinuan sat up in bed, stretched, his joints cracking, and squinted his eyes with a satisfied look. He felt refreshed and invigorated, as if his entire being had been thoroughly cleansed. My first reaction, of course, was to bring up the system. Ding. Luck check failed.</p>
<p>As expected, Shinuan was not surprised. This kind of thing is not something that can be accomplished overnight, but rather something that requires gradual accumulation and eventual breakthrough. He turned his head and looked at Lin Sharon, who was still fast asleep beside him with a strange emotion in his eyes. Her eyelashes fluttered slightly. A faint smile played on her lips.</p>
<p>She slept peacefully and calmly with a few tear stains still remaining on her face. As Shin Yuan watched, a sudden idea struck him and a mischievous smile crept onto his face. He leaned close to her ear, lowered his voice, and gently blew a breath. Chu ran, &quot;Wake up! It&#x27;s time for our morning exercise!&quot; Lin Charuns eyelashes fluttered a few times, and she opened her still misty eyes, looking at the ceiling with a bewildered expression. The next second, her gaze settled on Shun Yuans face.</p>
<p>Whoosh! Her entire face flushed red, even her ears turned red, and she immediately burrowed into the blankets to avoid his gaze. &quot;No, no.&quot; Her voice was muffled under the covers, soft and sweet. Shiny yuan laughed even more mischievously, pretending not to hear clearly, and reached out as if to pull at the corner of her blanket. &quot;What did you say? Speak louder. I didn&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>I said I couldn&#x27;t get up.&quot; Lin Sharon protested softly like a small animal that had run out of energy, hiding from him in grievance. That won&#x27;t do, Sharon. That&#x27;s lazy behavior, and you&#x27;ll get criticized. Shinyuan began to spout nonsense with a straight face, his expression particularly serious. I didn&#x27;t slack off.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon panicked, poked her head out from under the covers, and accused him with red eyes. It was you who bullied me. I bullied you. Shinuan looked completely innocent, then pulled her blanket and all into his arms and whispered in her ear. So, shall I continue to bully you today? A dash.</p>
<p>3 days. For three whole days, Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t even step out of the fortress&#x27;s gate. On Friday, the smart butler delivered an astonishing amount of high energy nutrient solution, exotic beast meat chops, and crimson flame fruit. It was as if the fortress had become a physical recovery base, and every meal was like a special supply for military combatants. It wasn&#x27;t until the morning of the fourth day that the heavy alloy door finally opened slowly.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan leaned against the door frame, looking like a paper doll whose energy had been drained and walked out with unsteady steps. He was weak and had dark circles under his eyes, as if he had just crawled back from the battlefield. But Lynn Sharon behind him seemed like a completely different person. Her complexion was rosy, her blood was abundant, her skin was radiant and glowing, and her eyes were as clear as mountain springs. The delicate girish charm that once belonged to her has completely disappeared, replaced by a lively quality that lies between innocence and allure.</p>
<p>Mr. Shun, how are you? The blackclad special forces captain standing guard outside twitched at the corner of his mouth as he looked at Shun Yuan, who appeared to have all his energy drained. Good job, Shin Yuan plopped down in the corner, took a bite of the crimson flame fruit, and only then did he catch his breath. Contact Leon. He swallowed the fruit, his eyes becoming exceptionally resolute, even tinged with a hint of despair.</p>
<p>I need special training. I&#x27;m not afraid of the system. I&#x27;m not afraid of women. But if my body isn&#x27;t up to par, I might really die in the arms of a woman. Half an hour later, inside the top-of-the-line combat pod at the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s training base, Lean stood at the door with her arms crossed, observing Shun Yuan&#x27;s swaying figure, and her lips twitched.</p>
<p>Oh, young Master Shan, you&#x27;ve already backed down after only 3 days. She glanced at him up and down a few times, lingering, especially on his waist and legs for a couple of seconds, her eyes filled with a teasing tone. I think your talent is not only mentally taxing, but also physically demanding. Shinuan blushed, picked up the sports drink, and gulped down a few mouthfuls, stubbornly holding on with his neck stiff. Sister Lee, stop being sarcastic.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m fighting for the company, the organization, and the people. All right. All right, martyr. Leon rolled her eyes, speechless, and brought up the training system. So, how do you want to train? Gravity chamber, simulated battlefield, actual combat pile driving.</p>
<p>No, I need a personal trainer. Shinyuan&#x27;s eyes lit up, and he held up one finger. It must be oneon-one. You&#x27;re still choosing your instructors. Leian raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Tell me, what are your shady conditions? First, she must be female. Shinyuan looked serious. A mix of men and women makes work less tiring. Female instructors are less intimidating, which helps to relax the mind and improve training efficiency. Secondly, she is good-looking and has a great figure.</p>
<p>Third, be single, have a clean romantic history, and don&#x27;t carry too many past burdens. Li Yun was dumbfounded. Is this training or recruiting concubines? Why not? Shin Yuan smiled and lowered his voice. Sister Lee, haven&#x27;t you already met her? My talent has side effects. What if more physical contact activates a promising talent? Wouldn&#x27;t that be a win-win situation for the company? This is called training and nurturing talent simultaneously.</p>
<p>A two-pronged approach. Lean burst out laughing. Have you no shame? The task requires it. Shiny Yuan spoke with conviction. Lie Yun was furious, but then she remembered Lin Churin, whom Shin Yuan had brought along, whose physique had improved dramatically.</p>
<p>An ordinary person who originally had no talent actually developed a faint sense of chi in just 3 days. This is simply a miracle in the fields of medicine and genetics. Okay, she gritted her teeth and agreed, uttering each word with difficulty. I&#x27;ll go get the data right away, and I&#x27;ll call on the whole company to help you. Chapter 11.</p>
<p>Selecting female instructors. Lean&#x27;s efficiency is ridiculously high. Less than 2 hours later, the doors to the previously empty fighting arena were pushed open. Two rows of beautiful women with distinct styles filed in, led by Le Yun. On the left are 10 stylish and exquisitly madeup urban beauties whom Leun transferred from the entertainment and public relations departments of Umbrella Corporation to be the face of the company.</p>
<p>On the right side, there were 10 female martial artists dressed in tight- fitting martial arts uniforms, exuding a fierce aura. They stood tall and proud, their eyes sharp, each step carrying the sound of wind and thunder, clearly seasoned veterans who had seen blood. The sight of 20 women standing there seemed to freeze the air in the entire training ground. The scent of perfume mixed with the aroma of hormones assaulted the very core of my being. Shin Yuan sat on a soft chair by the sidelines playing with the dragon soul jade in his hand, but his eyes scanned the crowd like radar.</p>
<p>Young Master Shan, &quot;Everyones here.&quot; Lean walked up to him, handed him an earpiece, and said in a cool tone. &quot;On the left is what you desire, visual appeal. On the right, a clean record,&quot; &quot;Choose whichever you prefer.&quot; Shin Yuan put on his headset, stood up, and walked to the left row first. The 10 women&#x27;s eyes lit up the moment they saw Shin Yuan. In the past few days, rumors about the new owner of Fortress number one, a mysterious young master and holding hundreds of billions of yuan in cash have been circulating wildly within the company.</p>
<p>Anyone who can climb this high branch, even if it&#x27;s just to be a fleeting instructor, will be set for life. Shin Xiao. The woman at the front of the line bowed first, her neckline low, revealing her ample bosom, and her voice was so sweet it could be drawn out like silk. Shin Yuan remained expressionless, extending a finger and gently tapping the back of her hand. Target: Jean Lily.</p>
<p>Aesthetics rating 78. Technological content 60%. Status: Neptune, crowded fish pond. Overall rating 65. Next, Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t even bother to glance at it again and simply waved his hand.</p>
<p>Jean Lilys smile froze instantly. She bit her lip in resentment, but under Li Yans cold gaze, she could only slink away. Second, a surgically enhanced face. Pass. The third one has a score of 80, but a messy private life, so pass.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan walked past like an emotionless security check machine. The row on the left may look glamorous, but under the systems truth revealing lens, they are all demons and monsters. They either had plastic surgery on their faces or were covered in too much masculine energy. None of them could reach the passing grade of 90 points. Sisterly, is this the beauty queen you found for me? Finally, Shin Yuan took off his headset with a look of disgust and complained.</p>
<p>The quality is so poor, anyone who didn&#x27;t know better would think I&#x27;d wandered into a spider&#x27;s web. Lee enrolled her eyes and said irritably, &quot;Nonsense. Truly top tier natural beauties are either already reserved by major families or a proud and arrogant female martial artists who would want to come and be a personal assistant for no reason.&quot; She pointed to the row of female warriors on the right who had remained silent. Their eyes even showing a hint of disdain. Looking for the best? Go pick one over there.</p>
<p>But let me warn you, these women aren&#x27;t just pretty faces. They all have explosive tempers. If you can&#x27;t handle them, you might get your third leg broken. Shinuan chuckled and rubbed his hands together. I love roses with thorns.</p>
<p>He turned around and stroed towards the queue on the right. The atmosphere here is completely different. There was no pungent cheap perfume smell, only a faint scent of sweat and a crisp, clean aroma of a strong person. Most of the 10 female warriors looked at Shun Yuan with scrutiny and even a hint of hidden hostility. In their eyes, this man, who was only somewhat handsome and had no martial arts aura, was just a spoiled brat who only knew how to bully others because of his background.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan wasn&#x27;t annoyed. His gaze fell on the first woman in the row. The woman was tall, about 1.75 m, and wore a black tight-fitting combat suit that perfectly accentuated her explosive figure, especially his legs, which were strong, powerful, and full of explosive force. But what&#x27;s most striking is her cold, aloof face and those eyes that seem to see everyone as trash. He reached out his hand.</p>
<p>Shinuan walked up to her and said calmly. The woman snorted coldly and didn&#x27;t move. Shiao Hongua, Lein shouted coldly from the side. The woman named Xiao Hong Shua reluctantly extended her hand with such force that it seemed she was about to slap Shin Yuan. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t mind and reached out to hold it.</p>
<p>Buzz, target of investigation, Xiao Hongua. Age 26. Talent: Frost Mastery Rank B. Realm Second Realm Marshall Master. Appearance rating 93, cold and elegant mature woman.</p>
<p>Body rating 95, top tier western woman. Shinyuan&#x27;s eyes lit up. These numbers are impressive. He was even taller than Le Yun. However, when his gaze swept to the next line, the smile on his face froze instantly.</p>
<p>Number of charging cycles 50. Overall score 90. Strategy suggestion. The target has an extreme admiration for the strong and a peculiar fetish for collecting the genes of the powerful. Those who have had relations with him are all exceptionally talented individuals.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan&#x27;s lips twitched violently. 50 times to collect the strongest. Good heavens, this isn&#x27;t some aloof and elegant older sister. She&#x27;s clearly a walking powerhouse harvester. How about it? Lie&#x27;s voice came through the earpiece tinged with shod and frea.</p>
<p>Shiao Hong Shua was a well-known ice queen, strong and with a great figure, but her taste was a bit unique. Shin Yuan released his hand expressionlessly, took half a step back, and cupped his hands in a respectful gesture towards Shiao Hongua. Sorry to bother you. Goodbye. Are you kidding me? What he wants is a personal vehicle, not a shared bicycle, and certainly not a shared power bank that anyone with the best skills can use.</p>
<p>Seeing Shun Yuans avoidance, Xiao Hongua frowned and coldly uttered two words: coward. Shin Yuan pretended not to hear and quickly walked to the next one. The second one was a woman wearing a red Chong Sam named Lumé. Before Shinuan could even speak, she leaned in, her peach blossom eyes brimming with tears, her body so soft it seemed boneless, almost pressing against Shinuan. Target: Lumé.</p>
<p>Appearance rating 93. Charming young woman. Body rating 96. Human peach. Overall score 94.</p>
<p>Host emotional type score + one. Long-term use of the infertility pill has resulted in the loss of good fortune score minus one. 94 points. Just one point short. Shinyuan looked at the one who had lost the ability to have good luck and his heart was bleeding.</p>
<p>That figure, that face, she&#x27;s absolutely the best of the best. Unfortunately, the core of the system task is good luck. Without good luck, it&#x27;s a veto. With his strong willpower, and mainly out of fear of failing to complete the task, he pushed away Lu May&#x27;s voluuptuous breasts that were about to touch his face. Sorry, I have no knowledge of infertility.</p>
<p>Lumi&#x27;s charming smile froze and a hint of hurt and surprise flashed in her eyes. Chapter 12. Airport and Dragon Bloodpool. This choice is too difficult. I&#x27;ve looked at several and they either don&#x27;t have enough points or have serious flaws.</p>
<p>Shinyuan side, his gaze finally settling on the two women at the end of the line who hadn&#x27;t spoken a word but exuded the strongest aura. One of them was wearing a dark blue business suit with black stockings that encased her incredibly long legs. She stood there like an ice sculpture. The other was dressed in a sharp suit, looking dashing and heroic. The two of them standing together were like ice and fire clashing.</p>
<p>Neither was willing to yield to the other, and the air was thick with tension. Lung Yu, Longing, Lean walked over, her tone becoming more serious. These two are among the most outstanding young talents in our umbrella corporation. They weren&#x27;t originally required to do this kind of mission, but when they heard you were looking for instructors, they volunteered. Voluntarily sign up? Shin Yuan raised an eyebrow, sensing that things weren&#x27;t so simple.</p>
<p>He first walked towards the icy beauty in business attire. Shin Yuan stood in front of L Yu. This woman has an incredibly strong aura. If Xiao Hongwas coldness is feigned, then Lus chill emanates from her very bones. She was slightly taller than Shun Yuan, looking down at him with an icy blue gaze devoid of emotion, as if she were looking at a stone.</p>
<p>Reach out your hand, Shin Yuan said, forcing himself to speak. Lung Yu did not refuse, nor did she make any extra movements. She simply mechanically raised her hand. Her fingers were long and slender. Her nails were neatly trimmed and unadorned, and her skin was so white it was almost transparent, revealing the bluish veins underneath.</p>
<p>The moment he touched her, a bone chilling coldness traveled up her fingertips, making Shaun Yuan shudder. Target to be explored. Cold moon. Age 26. Talent: Ice Element Mastery Rank A.</p>
<p>Realm, peak of the fourth realm, grand marshall master. Appearance rating 97. Iceelike divine beauty. The epitome of the aesthetic type. Status pure single.</p>
<p>Agrade talent. Appearance rating 97. Shinyuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. This is definitely the highest number he&#x27;s ever seen, especially those legs. Shun Yuans gaze involuntarily drifted downwards to those long legs encased in black stockings, straight, slender, and well proportioned.</p>
<p>Every line of work of art meticulously sculpted by God. Those legs, I could look at them for a year or even 10 years and never get tired of them. When his gaze fell on the next line of the system panel, he was completely dumbfounded. Body type rating 90, severely unbalanced. Body details: long legs rating S+ National Treasure level.</p>
<p>Waist to hip ratio S. Perfect. Bus size A. Promising future flat chest. Grade A.</p>
<p>Shinuan was stunned for a moment, then realized what was happening in this systems rating system. S is the highest and A is the lowest. He subconsciously looked up, his gaze falling on Lung used crisp business attire. It was as smooth as a freshly ironed shirt with almost no undulations. Indeed, when God opens a door, he closes a window.</p>
<p>This icy, mature woman has put all her talent points into her legs and face. Her chest area is so barren, it&#x27;s heartbreaking. Mr. Shun, what can I do for you? Seeing Shun Yuan staring blankly at his chest, Lyu frowned slightly, her voice sounding as if it contained shards of ice. She was aware of her weaknesses.</p>
<p>This is also what she has always cared about the most. In a martial arts world where strength reigns supreme, she can silence everyone with her formidable power. But in this context where feminine charm is the standard, that weakness is like a thorn in her side, especially since there was a woman named Ling standing next to her with an absolutely perfect figure. Shin Yuan snapped out of his days, let out a long sigh, and put on a pained expression. Instructor Lua, your legs are perfect.</p>
<p>Lyu raised her chin slightly, a gesture she was very confident about. Your face is top-notch, too. Lung Yus expression softened slightly. But Shin Yuan changed the subject, his gaze lingering once more on her smooth iron board-like chest for a second, his tone heavy with sorrow. I have extremely strict requirements regarding food reserves.</p>
<p>For the healthy growth of the next generation, I cannot take that risk. After all, we can&#x27;t let our children suffer. No matter how hard life is, we can&#x27;t let them go hungry. Shut up. Lung Yu&#x27;s perpetually icy face flushed red instantly filled with a mixture of shame and indignation.</p>
<p>How could she not understand what this bastard was saying? You think she&#x27;s too young? This good for nothing who only thinks with his lower body dares to complain about her being small. You&#x27;re asking for it. A burst of cold air erupted from Lung Yu, instantly turning the training ground into a layer of white frost. As a core member of the Umbrella Corporation, when has she ever suffered such humiliation? Cold Moon, step aside. Lung Yu bit her lip hard, her chest heaving violently, though not much.</p>
<p>She glared at Shin Yuan with a look that seemed to one pierce two transparent holes in him. I will definitely come back and you will regret it. She threw down those harsh words, then turned and left without looking back, her high heels clicking on the floor. Each step was taken with extreme force as if to crush the floorboards. Shiny Yuan watched her departing figure and shrugged.</p>
<p>Regret? It does not exist. The most important thing in life is to be honest. He turned around, his gaze passing over the female warriors who were still waiting and landing directly on the last person. The woman who stood like a javelin from beginning to end with a cold expression seemed completely unmoved by his decision to select an instructor. Longing Shinuan walked up to her.</p>
<p>Up close, this woman&#x27;s aura is frighteningly strong. She was half a head shorter than Shun Yuan, but the sharpness that emanated from her very bones made people afraid to look directly at her. Unlike Lung Yu&#x27;s aloofness, Lyings beauty has a metallic quality. Her features were sharp and deep with a commanding presence between her brows. Her impeccably tailored clothes completely covered her perfectly sculpted body.</p>
<p>Yet, one could still sense an astonishing burst of power beneath the taut fabric. Most importantly, Shin Yuans gaze swept over the high, rounded curves of her chest that filled out her clothes. There is information, and it&#x27;s big news. He reached out his hand. Shinyuan spoke.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, longing simply raised her hand. Her hands had thin calluses marks left from years of handling weapons and training. Hands clasped together. Unlike other girls, she wasn&#x27;t soft. Instead, she possessed a resilient warmth.</p>
<p>Boom dash. A familiar golden light exploded in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. The dazzling golden light almost blinding him. Target: Longing. Age 22.</p>
<p>Talent: Dragon Soul Battle Body, SS rank. Realm, Grand Marshall Master of the Fourth Realm. Appearance rating 97. Dragonborn god-like beauty. Body rating 95.</p>
<p>Perfect curves honed through countless trials. Status pure single. Overall rating 98 god tier special mission the embrace of the dragon born rewards SS level second talent awakening opportunity dragon blood tempering pool blueprint 98 points SS level talent these numbers are absolutely stunning shin yuan suppressed his overwhelming joy and instead of letting go gripped his hand even tighter instructor long shinuan looked into her eyes his previous playful smile vanished and his expression became more serious than ever before. Everyone else can leave now. All I want is you.&quot; The statement was extremely ambiguous, but no one present dared to laugh.</p>
<p>Long Yings sharp phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, showing no embarrassment at her words, but rather a scrutinizing gaze. &quot;Rason,&quot; she uttered two words coldly. &quot;Because only you are worthy of my upcoming intensive training.&quot; Shin Yuan spouted arrogant nonsense, but his eyes were incredibly firm. My intuition tells me you are very strong, extremely strong, and I, Shinuan, only cooperate with the strongest. Longing stared at him for a full 3 seconds.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t see through this man. Despite having no spiritual energy fluctuations whatsoever, and being as weak as a chick, his breath was surprisingly strong. But an order is an order. Good. Longing withdrew her hand, her voice firm and resolute.</p>
<p>I hope your body can be as tough as your mouth. 1 hour later, fortress number one. The heavy alloy door slid open and Shin Yuan led longing inside. As soon as I entered, I heard a series of cheerful footsteps. Brother Shinuan, you&#x27;re back.</p>
<p>Wearing pink bunny pajamas, Lynch flew over like a happy little bird and buried herself in Shiny Yuans arms. She had just finished showering, her body still smelling of fresh shower gel, her wet hair draped over her shoulders, making her look soft, cute, and adorable. I miss you so much. She nuzzled against Shun Yuans chest, about to beg for a hug, when she suddenly sensed that something was off. There seemed to be a chill emanating from behind Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Lyn Sharin peeked her little head out from Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms and blinked her big eyes as she looked over. A smart and capable older woman was standing at the door, looking at her expressionlessly. &quot;That woman is so tall and beautiful, with eyes as sharp as an eagle&#x27;s.&quot; Lynn Sharon shrank back in fright like a startled little rabbit and instinctively hid behind Shin Yuan, only revealing her eyes to timidly peek at Longing. Who is this person? Let me introduce it. Shin Yuan patted Lin Chars hand reassuringly.</p>
<p>This is Ling. Instructor Long, she&#x27;ll be living here from now on, and she&#x27;ll be in charge of my um physical training. Instructor Long, this is Lin Sharon. Long Yings gaze fell on Lin Sharon. Classy, she saw right through the girl.</p>
<p>Delicate, weak, a complete hot house flower. Girls like this wouldn&#x27;t last a second on the battlefield, but her gaze quickly froze. She keenly sensed that within this seemingly ordinary girl&#x27;s body. There was a faint yet extremely pure aura flowing. Those are traces of being nourished by some kind of highle energy.</p>
<p>Longing felt a slight tremor in her heart. Could what the Umbrella Corporation said be true? Does this Shin Yuan really have the ability to turn the impossible into the possible? Hello, Longing nodded, her tone still cool, but without any hostility. Hello, sister. Lyn Sharon called out softly. Although she was a little scared, she still mustered up her courage and stepped out from behind Shin Yuan, bowing obediently and saying, &quot;Please take care of me in the future.&quot; Two women.</p>
<p>She is gentle and tender, soft and cute. One was dashing and imposing. At this moment, the air inside Fortress 1 seemed to become somewhat subtle. Shinuan was caught in the middle, feeling incredibly pleased. This is the empire I conquered.</p>
<p>Chapter 13. The scientific beauty wants me to take my clothes. All right, everyone, stop standing there. Shin Yuan waved his hand dismissively, displaying the demeanor of a head of household. Longing, well arrange a room for you on Friday.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s on the second floor next to mine. Don&#x27;t hesitate to ask if you need anything. Longing didn&#x27;t say anything, but just gave him a deep look, picked up her simple bag, and went straight upstairs. Watching that tall figure disappear at the top of the stairs, Lynch finally breathed a sigh of relief, hugged Shin Yuans arm again, and rubbed her face against his clothes. Brother Shinuan, that older sister looks so fierce.</p>
<p>Is it fierce? Shin Yuan savored the feeling of his previous play and the 98 point score. A mischievous smile playing on his lips. That&#x27;s because you haven&#x27;t seen another side of her. Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ll make her more docil in the future.</p>
<p>Really? Of course. We&#x27;ll continue our special training tonight. I&#x27;ll demonstrate to you what it means to overcome strength with softness. Uggh. You&#x27;re so mean.</p>
<p>The next morning, sunlight streamed into the bedroom through the huge floor toseeiling windows. Shinyuan was awakened by a series of urgent knocks on the door. He groggy opened his eyes, feeling as if his whole body had been run over by a truck. incredibly sore, especially his kidneys, which felt empty as if they had been hollowed out. Last night, in order to show off his prowess in front of Lin Char and incidentally test the limits of the dragon energy&#x27;s nourishment, he went to great lengths.</p>
<p>It has to be said that Lin Char is becoming more and more lustrous, and her E-level talent is simply unforgettable. But the price was also heavy. Who is it? Shin Yuan called out weakly, put on his bathrobe, and dragged his heavy steps to open the door. The door opened. Longing, dressed in a black tight- fitting training suit, stood at the door.</p>
<p>She had clearly done her morning exercise. Fine beads of sweat clung to her forehead. A few strands of hair clung to her slender neck, and her chest rose and fell with her breath, creating a breathtaking arc. The bodysuit perfectly showcased her figure, honed through years of training. There wasn&#x27;t an ounce of excess fat, only powerful muscular lines.</p>
<p>In contrast, Shun Yuan, with his dark circles and unsteady gate, looked like a complete waistrol who had indulged in excessive pleasure. Longing looked him up and down, a hint of undisguised disdain flashing in her eyes. It&#x27;s 5:30. She raised her wrist to check her watch, her voice cold. According to the plan, it&#x27;s time for morning exercise now.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan yawned, leaned against the door frame, and said with a cheeky grin. Instructor Long, even the donkeys in the production team need a rest, right? I overworked myself last night trying to protect the future of Umbrella Corporation. Can I take a day off? Cannot. Longing refused decisively. She stepped forward and grabbed Shin Yuan&#x27;s arm.</p>
<p>Ouch, that hurts. Before Shinuan could react, he felt a strong force come at him, and Longing lifted him out of the room like a chick. Your body is too weak. as longing dragged him towards the private gym downstairs, she said coldly. With this kind of physical condition, it&#x27;s questionable whether you&#x27;ll even live past 30.</p>
<p>From today onwards, I&#x27;ll be in charge of your daily routine inside the gym. Horse stance 30 minutes, 200 push-ups, squats, 200. Longing was like a heartless, devilish drill instructor holding a pointer in her hand. Whenever Shin Yuan&#x27;s posture was slightly off or he tried to slack off, the pointer would land precisely on his buttocks or thighs. Snap! Keep your back straight.</p>
<p>Snap! Stop shaking your legs. Half an hour later, Shin Yuan collapsed on the yoga mat like a dead dog, panting heavily, his sweat soaking the carpet. &quot;No, it&#x27;s really not going to work.&quot; Shin Yuan waved his hand, feeling like his lungs were about to explode. Longing, if you want to murder your husband, no, your boss, just say so. Ling stood aside, looking at this hopeless case with a furrowed brow.</p>
<p>Too weak. They are ridiculously weak. She knew that Shin Yuan had an F-level physique, but his stamina was not even as good as that of an ordinary junior high school student. Get up and stretch. Longing walked over and pressed down on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The moment her hand touched Shinuan&#x27;s body, Shinuan couldn&#x27;t help but gasp. Ouch. Be gentle. That hurts. Ly Yings technique was extremely professional, but also extremely forceful.</p>
<p>She pressed on Shun Yuan&#x27;s stiff muscles to help him release the acid. The two were very close together. Shin Yuan could even smell the scent of her body, a mixture of sweat and a cool, refreshing fragrance. Despite the physical pain, Shinuan&#x27;s mind was racing. This is an SS level powerhouse.</p>
<p>If I could win her over. Instructor Long, your technique is pretty good. Do you often massage men? Shinuan teased fearlessly. Longing suddenly increased the pressure on her hand. Huh? Screams echoed throughout the fortress.</p>
<p>Shut up. Longing said coldly. If you say another word, I&#x27;ll disassemble your bones and reassemble them. Although she said that, Longing felt something was off. In the instant of contact, she felt that faint yet warm current emanating from Shun Yuan&#x27;s body again, which relieved the tension in her meridians caused by intense cultivation.</p>
<p>What kind of constitution does this person have? Noon. Shinuan sat in the restaurant looking at the pile of high protein, nutritious meals that Friday had carefully prepared, but he had no appetite at all. Boiled chicken breast, broccoli, raw egg. I can&#x27;t live like this anymore. Friday.</p>
<p>Shinuan put down his fork, wiped his mouth, and a resolute glint flashed in his eyes. I&#x27;m here. The smart home assistant&#x27;s voice sounded. I have money, right? Yes, sir. Your account balance is currently 999.9 billion credits with unlimited overdraft privileges.</p>
<p>Very good. Shinuan snapped his fingers. Contact a head hunting firm for me. No, post a bounty directly on the dark web. I need to find a doctor, a top tier expert specializing in human potential and genetic evolution.</p>
<p>No matter how much it costs, no matter who the other party is, as long as they can improve my health and help him become stronger in the shortest amount of time, I&#x27;ll give them a blank check. Since our bodies can&#x27;t keep up, let&#x27;s make up for it with money. He refused to believe that there was any kidney deficiency in this world that money couldn&#x27;t solve. 3 p.m. A black helicopter without any markings roared down onto the helellipad on the top floor of Fortress 1.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan, accompanied by Ling, stood by the helipad to welcome this savior who had been hired at great expense. The hatch opened. First, a pair of red high heels stepped on the ground, making a crisp sound. Next came a pair of shapely, long legs encased in pure black stockings, straight, slender, and voluuptuous. Above that was a white lab coat stretched to the point of bursting.</p>
<p>When the woman had completely stepped out of the cabin, Shinuans breath hitched for a second. If you didn&#x27;t see the white coat, you would think she was the top hostess at some high-end club or a porn star walking the red carpet. She wore a pair of exquisite gold- rimmed glasses. Her long hair was casually pinned up at the back of her head with a few stray strands falling beside her ears, exuding a lazy yet intellectual beauty. Her face was stunningly beautiful with a mature woman&#x27;s charm in every corner of her eyes and brows.</p>
<p>But the most fatal flaw is her figure. That was truly a case of a mountain range seen from different angles, a peak seen from different sides. The undulations beneath those white coats seemed to defy the laws of physics. Every step they took triggered a mini earthquake. Jerated.</p>
<p>Absolutely girated. Shun Yuan swallowed hard, feeling as if his vision had been purified by this scene. Are you the sucker who spent 1 billion credits just to find someone to treat his body? The woman walked up to Shun Yuan, pushed up her glasses, and spoke in a lazy, husky voice that was so pleasant it made one&#x27;s bones melt. She showed no courtesy whatsoever because of Shun Yuans status. Instead, she treated him as if he were an interesting toy.</p>
<p>He reached out and firmly grasped Su Ching Xus soft, boneless little hand, a sucker. No, no, no, Dr. Su. This is called sacrificing oneself for science. As long as I can become stronger, I&#x27;d give up 10 billion.</p>
<p>let alone 1 billion. Su Ching Zhu looked at the man who was holding her hand tightly, his eyes burning with a strange sense of nobility, and a playful smile appeared on her lips. She had researched Shin Yuans background before she came. An F-level waist was suddenly treated as an honored guest by the Umbrella Corporation. That&#x27;s interesting in itself.</p>
<p>Now, in close proximity, her S-level talent, Gene Insight, was actually trembling slightly. It seemed that this man&#x27;s body held some kind of secret that even she couldn&#x27;t see through. That&#x27;s very interesting. Suing Xu grabbed Shin Yuan&#x27;s wrist with her other hand, her slender fingers resting on his pulse, her eyes instantly turning fervent. Your body is truly a treasure trove.</p>
<p>Deal. I&#x27;ll take this job. Chapter 14. A research gym with a score of 98 requires a 90% interest rating. Fortress 1, a top tier medical laboratory.</p>
<p>This place was originally set up to prepare for wartime emergency rescue, but it has now been requisitioned by Su Ching Zhu and transformed into her private territory. Various sophisticated instruments whose names Shin Yuan couldn&#x27;t recall were humming, and a dazzling stream of data was flashing across the huge holographic screen. Take off. Suing Zu held a notepad in her hand and threw out a single word without turning her head. Shinuan froze for a moment, then instinctively clutched his chest.</p>
<p>here. This isn&#x27;t a good idea. There&#x27;s also Ling standing next to him, looking like a door god. Stop talking nonsense. Such turned around, a cold glint flashing behind her gold- rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m the doctor. You&#x27;re the patient. In the face of science, there is no gender. She walked up to Shin Yuan, and a rich, mature fragrance wafted towards her. Or do you want me to do it myself? She stretched out her slender fingers and gently traced them across Shin Yuans chest, her fingertips sending a tingling electric-like sensation through her.</p>
<p>Who could withstand this? Shin Yuan blushed, gritted his teeth, and quickly stripped off his shirt. His body, not particularly robust, and even somewhat thin from the fatigue of the past few days, was exposed to the air. &quot;Turn around.&quot; Such command rang out again. Shinuan turned around stiffly, feeling as if several laser beams were sweeping across his back, making it feel hot and burning. Just then, a pair of hands, slightly cool yet incredibly delicate and soft, touched his back.</p>
<p>Such fingers slowly traced along his spine from the cervical vertebrae to the coxix, carefully touching each vertebrae and feeling his skeletal structure. Bone density is 30% below the standard value. muscle mass is low and there is a severe deficiency of chi and blood. As she checked, she recited a series of data that made Shin Yuan want to die. However, the instant her fingers touched Shin Yuans skin, the familiar virtual panel automatically unfolded in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind.</p>
<p>Gold panel target Su Chingu. Age 28. Talent: Genetic Insight: Srank. Realm, Second Realm Martial Artist. Appearance rating 97.</p>
<p>Intellectual and beautiful. Body rating 99. Human nuclear weapon. Body details bust size G. Under bus size S.</p>
<p>Leg length size S. Number of times zero. Overall rating 98. God tier. Shin Yuan&#x27;s breathing suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>A physique score of 99 out of 100. This is beyond the realm of what humans can achieve. And that S-level talent gene insight. No wonder she was put in charge of her own body. Isn&#x27;t she just a human-shaped self-propelled highrecision scanner? Just as Shin Yuan was reeling from the terrifying data, new words appeared on the golden screen once again.</p>
<p>Ding! A god level target with a score of 98 or above has been detected. Special mission issued. Sparks of scientific research. Mission objective to increase Su Chingus research interest in the host to 90%. Note, the key to winning over this target is to arouse her thirst for knowledge and exploration, not to increase her affection level.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s heart pounded wildly. Research interest level, not a favorability rating. This system really knows how to treat people differently based on their status. Before he could recover from this novel mission mode, the reward information that popped up at the bottom of the panel completely blanked his mind. Personal reward.</p>
<p>One random S-rank bloodline. Personal reward. Future underlings who live on the same territory as the host and feel a sense of belonging to that territory will have their genetic potential development cap permanently increased by 5%. Territory is bound and cannot be changed at will. Boom.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt as if the top of his head was about to be blown off by this immense happiness. Srank bloodline. That&#x27;s a star beast and a bloodline level that only a star beast capable of destroying a nation possesses. And those future underlings who feel a sense of belonging to this territory will have their genetic potential increased by 5%. What does that mean? This means that the number of talented martial artists living in the same area as him in the future may increase several times over.</p>
<p>This means that countless martial artists who are stuck at a bottleneck and unable to break through it in their lifetime will have the possibility of going further. At that moment, Shinuan realized the truth. Once they&#x27;ve grown up, they all seem to have their own underlings. Having figured this out, Shin Yuan&#x27;s last worry about being used as a tool for the rest of his life disappeared, replaced by a sense of full participation and a burning fighting spirit. Salted fish lying flat.</p>
<p>it, I&#x27;m going to pull off a big heist. Wow, that muscle density, that bone strength. Su Ching Xu touched it while shaking her head and sighing, her tone full of disdain. It&#x27;s a complete shoddy construction project. I really don&#x27;t know how you managed to stick with it.</p>
<p>Was it all just willpower? Upon hearing this, Ly Yings lips twitched slightly, and she turned her head away, seemingly trying to suppress a laugh. Shin Yuan felt utterly humiliated. Dr. Su, can we talk to each other nicely? I paid money to solve problems, not to listen to your complaints. What&#x27;s the rush? Suing Xu pushed up her gold rimmed glasses, revealing eyes that shone brightly behind the lenses.</p>
<p>Turn over and lie down on that testing machine. quick. She almost impatiently pulled Shin Yuan and pressed him down onto a futuristic silver white recliner. Then she walked to the huge light screen next to her, her hands moving in a blur as countless complex data streams and human models flashed across the screen. The basic plan is in place.</p>
<p>In just a few dozen seconds, Su Chingu stopped what she was doing, her tone filled with an undeniable excitement. The first step is a medicinal bath to temper your body. Use the essence and blood of the A3 level exotic beast, the lava giant lizard, combined with 37 kinds of high energy medicinal herbs to perform a medicinal bath, forcibly opening up your blocked meridians and increasing your total blood volume and physical strength. The second step involves highintensity physical training under high pressure to fully activate the drug&#x27;s effects and integrate it into your limbs and bones. Step three.</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, Longing interrupted her coldly. No. Longing stepped forward, her expression solemn. His physical constitution was too weak. His meridians were as fragile as paper, forcing him to take a medicinal bath with the essence blood of the lava giant lizard would cause the violent fire attribute energy to instantly burst his meridians, causing him to explode and die.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s your old-fashioned method. Such didn&#x27;t turn her head and responded coldly. My potion formula has undergone tens of thousands of simulations and calculations with the medicinal proportions accurate to the milligram. It neutralizes the ferocity of the fire elemental energy, perfectly stimulating his physical potential without causing any permanent damage. She turned around and looked directly at Longing, her tone carrying the absolute confidence of a top scientist.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, times have changed. Please trust science. The atmosphere in the training room instantly became tense. One represents traditional martial arts passed down for thousands of years, and the other represents cuttingedge technology that is changing with each passing day. Two completely different ideas collided most fiercely at this moment.</p>
<p>In the end, Shinuan still chose the technology route. A triumphant smile spread across Su Ching Xus face. She took out a sealed test tube made of special crystals from the silver metal briefcase she was carrying. The test tube contained a dark golden viscous liquid like molten gold which flowed slowly under the light radiating a chilling energy. She gently shook the test tube and gave Shin Yuan a cruel smile.</p>
<p>This is my latest research result. Dragon blood number one. It is extracted from the spinal fluid of an ancient dragon descendant. An ordinary third realm martial artist only needs a single drop to be overwhelmed by the enormous life energy contained within. She walked up to Shin Yuan and pressed the cold test tube against his chest.</p>
<p>And you need a whole tube. Are you ready to experience the thrill of having your cells torn apart inch by inch and then reassembled inch by inch? Chapter 15. Bathing with beauties hellish body tempering. This  looking at the tube of dark golden liquid in front of him, which exuded an ominous aura. Shun yuan felt his legs trembling.</p>
<p>Spinal fluid of an ancient dragon descended subspecies. A single drop could overwhelm a martial artist at the third realm. And he, an ordinary person who hasn&#x27;t even reached the threshold of martial arts apprenticeship, is going to be forced to drink a whole tube of it. This isn&#x27;t body tempering. This is clearly murder.</p>
<p>Dr. Sue, I think it would be safer for you to switch back to the lava giant lizards blood essence first. Perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t experiment with your latest research findings. Su Ching Xu seemed to enjoy his ghostlike expression. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses and a playful smile appeared on her lips.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s wrong? Are you scared? Don&#x27;t worry. After I diluted dragon blood number one dozens of times, its threat level is only slightly higher than that of the lava giant lizard&#x27;s essence blood. To ensure the integrity of the experimental data, I will try my best to keep you alive.&quot; As she spoke, she walked toward the enormous alloy bathtub, which resembled a small swimming pool, and poured rows of different colored potions into it. The once clear water was instantly stained a strange dark green and it was bubbling and steaming. All right, go in my little guinea pig.</p>
<p>Such clapped her hands and gave instructions to Shin Yuan. Shin Yuan swallowed hard, stealed himself, and walked towards the bathtub. He repeated the phrase, &quot;If you want to become a superior person and a true strong man, you must first taste the bitterness of hell to himself no less than 800 times.&quot; This is more than just hell. It&#x27;s a direct route to the 18th level of hell. Just as he was about to step into the bathtub, Su Ching Xus voice rang out again.</p>
<p>This time directed at Ling, who was watching coldly from the side. Instructor Long, you join us, too. What? For the first time, a clear look of astonishment appeared on Lyings icy face. In order to guide the medicinal effects more accurately and monitor the energy flow in his body in real time, I need a highle martial artist to assist me. Such Ching Zu turned around and explained in a serious tone.</p>
<p>Of course, the most important thing is that Dragon Blood number one&#x27;s energy is too doineering. What if some uncontrollable accident happens midway, such as him not being able to withstand the energy impact and his meridians being severed? She paused, glancing at Ling through her glasses, her tone becoming meaningful. You&#x27;ll probably have a hard time explaining this to yourself, won&#x27;t you? L Yings brows furrowed instantly. She stared at Su Chingu silently for a few seconds as if trying to figure out what this woman was really up to. She always felt that Su Ching Zu had planned all of this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>But she couldn&#x27;t refuse because what Su Chingu said was true. Shun Yuan safety was the top priority. After a brief moment of deliberation, Longing silently and decisively took off her black combat jacket. Beneath the jacket was a black sports bra that hugged her body&#x27;s curves even better. Not an ounce of excess fat.</p>
<p>Every muscle line is full of power and physique, brimming with astonishing explosive force. This perfect body, brimming with health and strength, creates a striking visual contrast with Su Ching Xus voluuptuous and fiery sexiness. Shinuan felt his nose getting hot and his mouth and throat dry. God, a scientific research prodigy with a score of 98. A future female warrior with a rating of 98 is now going to accompany her.</p>
<p>This direct route to hell doesn&#x27;t seem so unbearable after all. He subconsciously gave Su Ching Xu a thousand thumbs up in his mind. Dr. Su, you are like my own sister. Just as he was lost in thought.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xus gaze swept over them unintentionally, her eyes carrying a hint of approval that said, you know what&#x27;s good for you. Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat, and he instantly understood. Not only is he top-notch in physique and brains, but he&#x27;s also a god tier support player with a huge reputation. While Shin Yuan was still feeling emotional, Longing had already stepped into the huge bathtub with a blank expression, sat down cross-legged, and closed her eyes as if everything around her was irrelevant to her. Shinuan took a deep breath and stepped inside, stealing himself.</p>
<p>The scalding hot liquid instantly enveloped his entire body, and a burning, stinging sensation spread through his skin. He gritted his teeth and sat down opposite Ling. Such Chingu nodded in satisfaction. She walked to the bathtub and held up the dark gold dragon blood number one vial. Are you ready? It&#x27;s about to begin.</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, she plunged the needle into the liquid and poured the entire tube of viscous dragon blood essence into the bathtub. Boom. Dash. The dark green liquid. The moment the dragon&#x27;s blood was injected seemed to boil like gasoline that had been ignited.</p>
<p>A violent energy, even more terrifying than magma, exploded continuously. A dash Shin Yuan only had time to let out a shrill scream before he felt as if he had been thrown into an erupting volcano. An indescribable, excruciating pain emanated from the depths of every cell in my body. The skin was being burned, the muscles were being torn apart, and the bones were being crushed inch by inch. His vision went black, his consciousness began to blur, and he was like a fish thrown ashore, struggling wildly in the scalding liquid, almost fainting on the spot.</p>
<p>It hurts so much. This is a pain that no human being can bear. Just as his consciousness was about to be completely swallowed by the excruciating pain, a pair of cold yet powerful hands suddenly pressed down on his shoulders, which he was flailing wildly. Longing, who was opposite, had opened her eyes at some point. She looked at Shun Yuans face, contorted with extreme pain, her brows furrowed.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t agree with Su Ching Xus radical and almost cruel methods, but her military instincts made her unable to stand by and watched the mission target die in front of her. The next second, she lunged forward, approaching Shin Yuan amidst the boiling medicinal liquid, and her hand flashed out and pressed against his back. A cool and pure energy flowed through her palm and was forcibly transferred into Shun Yuan&#x27;s chaotic and violent body. Guard your mind and focus your attention on your lower abdomen. L Yings cold shout was like a thunderclap exploding in his chaotic mind.</p>
<p>If you want to die, then give up. These cold words, however, acted like a shot of adrenaline, sharply waking Shin Yuan from his fading consciousness. Give up? Are you kidding me? He thought of Lin Shauns sleeping face, which was stre with tears yet filled with contentment. I haven&#x27;t had enough fun yet. How could you die here? Roar.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan let out a roar, using the last bit of strength in his body to forcefully suppress the instinctive struggle of his body. And following Long Yings command, he concentrated all his thoughts into his dantion. Guided by Long Yings pure internal energy, the rampant and violent medicinal power within his body seemed to find an outlet and began to be forcibly restrained and converge in one direction. Time passed by second by second. The only sounds in the training room were Shun Yuan&#x27;s suppressed painful roars and the bubbling of the bathtub.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zu stood to the side, arms crossed, quietly watching the frantically jumping data curves on the screen, her eyes behind her glasses gleaming with an increasingly bright light. She anticipated that Shin Yuan might break down, beg for mercy, or even go into shock. But she never expected that this seemingly frail man could actually withstand the first wave of the most violent energy impact from dragon blood number one with his own willpower and with Lyings help. His willpower exceeded his own assessment. I don&#x27;t know how much time passed.</p>
<p>Maybe an hour, maybe 2 hours. As the boiling medicinal liquid in the bathtub gradually subsided, and its color changed from dark green to clear, Shin Yuan&#x27;s painful roars finally stopped. The excruciating pain subsided like a receding tide. Instead, there is a feeling of complete comfort and strength. Shinuan opened his eyes and clearly felt a warm power flowing through his limbs and bones.</p>
<p>The blood and energy that had been depleted due to days of hard work were now so full that they seemed about to overflow. Every muscle, every bone is filled with power. He&#x27;s gotten stronger. It&#x27;s over. Longing withdrew her hand, her voice carrying a hint of barely perceptible weariness.</p>
<p>She gave Shin Yuan a deep look, her eyes filled with complex emotions. This man was much more resilient than she had imagined. Just then, Su Chingu walked over quickly, holding a wristwatch style detector in her hand, and without saying a word, she put it on Shun Yuans wrist. Beep beep. On the light screen, a series of data were rapidly refreshed.</p>
<p>Suching eyes widened, a hint of surprise in her gaze. Chi and blood value 660. Bone density increased by 200%. Muscle strength increased by 350%. You&#x27;re already at the late stage of the first realm Marshall apprentice.</p>
<p>In just 2 hours, you went from an ordinary person to someone who has stepped into the realm of martial arts. Your body&#x27;s absorption rate of the medicine has reached a staggering 97%. This is unscientific. Suching gaze towards Shun Yuan completely changed from that of a rare experimental subject to that of a genius martial artist. Shinyuan slowly stood up and looked down at his hands.</p>
<p>He gently squeezed his hand. Crack. A crisp popping sound suddenly rang out in the air. This is what power feels like. He raised his head and looked past Su Chingu, who was still in shock and landed on Ling, who was sitting cross-legged opposite him.</p>
<p>Thank you, Instructor Long. Starting tomorrow, the training intensity can be doubled. Chapter 16. Instructor Long wants to do extra training. When Shinuan came out of the messy training room, he felt like a completely different person.</p>
<p>He changed into a clean set of casual clothes. His steps light and quick, each step containing explosive power. The overflowing blood and chi within his body were washing over his limbs and bones. Late stage of martial apprentice realm. In just 2 hours, he went from an ordinary person who couldn&#x27;t even kill a chicken to a genuine martial artist.</p>
<p>He was looking for a mirror to admire his transformed appearance when he looked up and met the cold figure at the end of the corridor. Longing she had also changed into a clean black combat uniform and was standing with her arms crossed against the wall, seemingly waiting for him. Shinuan&#x27;s excited smile froze instantly. An untimely thought flashed through his mind like lightning. He suddenly recalled that just now in that boiling pool of medicine, he had been tormented by inhuman pain to the point of losing his mind.</p>
<p>And when his hands were frantically thrashing in the scalding liquid, he seemed to have grabbed something. The feel of that touch was completely different from Long Yings usual steely demeanor. Shin Yuans Adams apple bobbed involuntarily. His gaze began to wander, and he dared not meet her eyes. &quot;Damn it.</p>
<p>It seems we&#x27;ve grabbed the wrong spot. How are you feeling?&quot; Ly Yings voice remained cold and indifferent, revealing no emotion. &quot;Ah, great. Very good. I feel like I could kill a bull with one punch.&quot; Shin Yuan scratched his head guiltily, trying to get away with it with an exaggerated tone.</p>
<p>Very good. Longing nodded, straightened up from the wall, and slowly walked towards him. As she walked, she flexed her slender, fair hands, her knuckles making a series of crisp, cracking sounds. Now that you have reached the first level of martial arts mastery, and your physical strength far exceeds expectations, the previous training plan needs to be scrapped. She stopped in front of Shun Yuan, her sharp phoenix eyes scanning him up and down as if assessing a newly sharpened weapon.</p>
<p>From now on, double the training intensity. The smile on Shun Yuans face froze completely. Double to help you quickly familiarize yourself with the surge of power within your body. I will personally provide you with practical guidance. L Yings lips seemed to curve into a very faint smile so quickly that it was almost an illusion, she added.</p>
<p>So you won&#x27;t accidentally do it again. She emphasized the words slipped hand very heavily. Shinuan&#x27;s scalp tingled instantly. She definitely sensed it. This is hardly practical guidance.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s clearly settling personal scores. With her strength as a fourthle grand marshall master, her so-called guidance would probably only make her feel like she&#x27;s been beaten to a pulp and rendered unable to take care of herself. The instinct for survival made Shun Yuan&#x27;s brain work at an extremely fast pace. No, we absolutely cannot let her succeed. The next second, the guilt and embarrassment on his face vanished, replaced by an extremely serious, even somewhat sacred expression.</p>
<p>Instructor Dragon. He straightened his back and spoke with righteous indignation. Training is important, but I have something more urgent and important to do right now that needs to be done immediately. This sudden change surprised even Longing. Shin Yuan pressed his advantage, continuing with an air of righteous indignation.</p>
<p>After Dr. pursues medicinal bath tempering. I am now full of chi and blood and full of energy. This is the golden period when my talent is at its strongest. This is a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>I must return immediately and join forces with Chu ran to press our advantage. Before long, Ing could even react to his shameless remarks. Shin Yuan turned and ran. He practically became a blur, running while shouting back. Instructor Long, you go ahead and get busy.</p>
<p>Ly Yings outstretched hand froze in midair. As she watched Shun Yuans retreating figure, a speechless expression appeared for the first time on her perpetually icy and beautiful face. Her clenched fist remained clenched for a long time. Cluck, cluck. A suppressed chuckle came from the side.</p>
<p>Such Chingu also came out at some point. She pushed up her gold rim glasses and was looking at the data curves representing Shun Yuans heart rate and speed on the screen with great interest. My heart rate was 180 and my instantaneous speed reached 15 m/s, surpassing the peak speed of a sprinter. It seems that the effects of dragon blood number one are even better than I expected. She walked over to Ling, who was still somewhat petrified, and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t mind, Instructor Long.</p>
<p>You see, you have a thick skin, clear goals, strong execution, and a high level of enthusiasm and initiative for these tedious, repetitive tasks.&quot; Such Chingghus glasses reflected a gleam of wisdom as she calmly summarized in the tone of someone analyzing a lab report. They are simply the perfect cattle and horses with a long flowering period and high efficiency. Longing. She felt her fists grow harder. With a bang, Shin Yuan smashed open the gate of fortress number one and rushed inside.</p>
<p>Lyn Sharon was wearing an adorable bunny pajama set, curled up on the sofa, engrossed in reading a thick paper book. Hearing the noise, she looked up in surprise. You come back. Before she could finish speaking, she was lifted into the air by a tremendous force. Ah.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon let out a short gasp and instinctively hugged Shin Yuans neck. The book in her hand falling to the carpet with a thud. When she met Shin Yuans eyes, which seemed to be burning with flames, her pretty face instantly turned bright red. She shily punched his chest with her small fist, the sound barely audible. You&#x27;re here again.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#x27;m back again. Holding the soft, fragrant body in his arms, Shin Yuan felt a surge of heroic spirit. He stroed to the huge floor toseeiling window. Outside the window, the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s headquarters were brightly lit at night with countless points of light converging into a dazzling galaxy, a beautiful blend of order and power. Shin Yuan rested his chin on the girl&#x27;s shoulder and spoke softly in a husky yet gentle voice near her fair, jade-like ear.</p>
<p>Chu ran, this is not nonsense. He looked out the window at the myriad lights of homes and thought, &quot;We are all creating miracles.&quot; These words seemed to possess a kind of magic. Lynn Sharn&#x27;s body, which had been struggling slightly due to shyness, instantly softened. When she looked up, her clear, watery eyes reflected Shun Yuan&#x27;s serious profile, as well as the dazzling starry sky outside the window. All the shyness and unease transformed into deep tenderness and dependence at this moment.</p>
<p>Um, she nodded emphatically, then deliberately raised her delicate chin. The last bit of guilt Shin Yuan felt for skipping training was instantly overwhelmed by a huge sense of satisfaction. He swept the girl up in his arms and her cute bunny pajamas rolled up as he did so, revealing a pair of straight, slender, and beautiful legs that gleamed like ivory. Late at night, Longing sat cross-legged on the bed, her eyes closed, meditating. Vital energy flowed slowly around her, trying to calm her agitated mind, but it didn&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>Call longing suddenly opened her eyes, and a rare flame of irritation burned in her sharp phoenix eyes. She clenched her fists so tightly that her knuckles turned slightly white from the force. &quot;That bastard. Tomorrow, tomorrow, she&#x27;s going to make this unrestrained guy experience firsthand what it truly means to be completely drained.&quot; Chapter 17. He got brutally beaten by Long Ying.</p>
<p>And then his hands slipped. The next morning, before it was fully light, Shin Yuan was fast asleep, dreaming that he had already ascended the throne as emperor and was surrounded by 3,000 beauties. Lin Sharon, wearing an adorable bunny apron, was feeding him peeled grapes in small bites. Su Ching Zhu, standing to the side, was holding sophisticated instruments, analyzing the grape&#x27;s genetic sequence with a serious expression, muttering to herself, &quot;Excessive sugar content will affect activity. It is recommended to replace it with a low sugar, high protein exotic beast fruit.&quot; Meanwhile, Ling, the goddess of war, stood expressionless behind him, holding a gleaming military dagger and peeling an apple for him.</p>
<p>My beloved concubine, make it a little thinner,&quot; Shin Yuan commanded in his dream. Suddenly, a bone-chilling cold pierced through his dream, freezing him deep into his soul. He jolted awake and opened his eyes abruptly. Long Yings handsome and spirited face hovered less than half a meter above him, quietly looking down at him with eyes colder than the dagger in her hand. She had changed into a sleek black combat suit, still carrying the slight chill and smell of sweat from her morning workout.</p>
<p>Good morning, Instructor. Long Shin Yuan forced a smile that looked more like a grimace and instinctively shrank deeper into the warm blankets. Without saying a word, Longing simply reached out of hand, grabbed the back of his pajamas by the collar, and pulled him out of bed like a calf that had done something wrong. Oh, so cold. Shiny Yuan stepped barefoot onto the cold floor, shivering from the cold, and was wide awake.</p>
<p>Starting today, you are no longer entitled to sleep in. L Yings voice was devoid of any emotion. She dragged him along as if he were a bag of trash, heading straight for the training room. Over the next two weeks, Shin Yuan experienced firsthand what it meant to be in hell on earth. Longing completely treated him like a human punching bag, and she wouldn&#x27;t stop him from doing so.</p>
<p>The punch is too slow, resulting in a dispersed force. Bang! Shinyuan was struck in the side by a powerful whip kick and flew sideways, crashing into the soft protective mat. slow to react, full of flaws. Slap. Shinyuan had just managed to get up when he received a slap across the face that was neither too hard nor too soft.</p>
<p>The slap made him see stars and half of his face went numb. Instructor Long, you promised you wouldn&#x27;t hit my face. I rely on this face to make a living. Shin Yuan covered his face and protested indignantly. Longing flexed her wrists and gave him a cold glance.</p>
<p>One more thing, I can apply to the company to switch to a more direct manual method. Shin Yuan immediately shut up. He had no doubt that given this female warrior style of doing things, she was absolutely capable of doing such a thing. Every day, Shinuan&#x27;s pig-like screams echoed in the training room. Oh, my back.</p>
<p>Stop. I surrender. I surrender. Okay, sister. I called you sister.</p>
<p>Please be gentle. This is a valuable asset for the future. However, no matter how much he begged for mercy or acted shamelessly, Longing remained unmoved. In every sparring session, she beat him to a pulp, but skillfully controlled her strength, keeping him just on the verge of collapse without letting him pass out. It hurts.</p>
<p>It really hurts. But the results are truly remarkable. In the daily cycle of being passively attacked, Shinuan&#x27;s reaction speed, resilience, and combat skills are improving at an unbelievable rate. He has even improved his ability to withstand Long Yings attacks, going from being unable to last more than 10 seconds at the beginning to now being able to barely last 3 minutes. On this day, Longing swiftly threw Shun Yuan to the ground with a clean and decisive over-the-shoulder throw, then pounced on him.</p>
<p>Her long, straight legs instantly wrapping around his neck, her arms hooking around his arms, forming a textbook arm bar in an instant. Ugg. Shinyuan felt as if his arm was about to be broken in the next second. The feeling of suffocation and excruciating pain surged up at the same time, leaving his mind blank. His survival instinct made him start to struggle frantically, waving his hands wildly upwards, trying to grab onto something for leverage.</p>
<p>Then his palm touched her again, just like yesterday. Shinuan&#x27;s brain went blank for a moment. Almost at the same time, Ling, who was exerting her strength, suddenly stiffened. An unfamiliar heat surged uncontrollably from her neck to her ears, and two charming blushes appeared on her perpetually icy face. The pressure on his hands unconsciously loosened slightly.</p>
<p>Now, seizing this once-ina-lifetime opportunity, Shin Yuan suddenly exerted force in his waist, and with a somersault, managed to flip over and break free from the deadly lock. He scrambled to a safe distance, panting heavily, his face showing relief at surviving the ordeal. Longing slowly stood up from the ground. She lowered her head, her black hair hanging down, making it impossible to see her expression. The air in the training room seemed to freeze at that moment, eerily quiet.</p>
<p>That instructor Long, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t intentional. It was purely accidental, an accident.&quot; Shin Yuan explained guilty, his voice growing softer and softer. The next second, Longing suddenly raised her head. in her sharp phoenix eyes. It seemed as if two clusters of fury capable of burning everything were burning.</p>
<p>You find hit. The three words were practically squeezed out from between his teeth. Boom. Longing moved faster than ever before. Ah, she murdered her husband.</p>
<p>Shinyuan screams were more piercing than ever before. But he found that this kind of interaction, which could break the iceberg like instructor&#x27;s defenses, greatly alleviated the boredom and pain of training. After each training session, the half-dead Shinuan would be thrown into the medicinal bath prepared by Su Ching Xu next door by Longing, who had a fierce look on her face. Under the extreme stimulation of both ice and fire, his injuries would heal at a visible speed, and he would become energetic again. Such adjusted her glasses, looked at the soaring data on the screen, and asked with great interest.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, &quot;What new stimulation method did you use today?&quot; His adrenaline secretion was three times the normal peak and the effect was very significant. Longing turned and left without a word. Her face cold, her back view exuding a murderous aura that said, &quot;Don&#x27;t mess with me.&quot; Shin yuan soaked in the fragrant medicinal liquid, groaned comfortably, and habitually opened the system panel. Target: Longing. Affection level 54.</p>
<p>Extremely annoyed. It did drop a little. Shin Yuan felt a chill in his heart. But when he looked down, a line of brand new gold text made his eyes widen instantly. Ding.</p>
<p>Due to special physical contact, the target long Yings conquest progress has unlocked a new stage. Breaking the ice. I see. Shin Yuans lips curled into a smug smile. It seems that conventional methods are indeed useless in dealing with this iceberg.</p>
<p>We have to use some special means. Chapter 18. Martial artist realm achieved. Oops, another slip of the hand. Before long, Su Ching Xu was excitedly recording every change in his body&#x27;s data with various instruments in hand.</p>
<p>This is insane. Absolutely insane. She stared at the constantly fluctuating curves on the light screen and murmured to herself, &quot;Your body is like a bottomless pit. The absorption and conversion rates of the medicine completely defy existing biological theories. Chi and blood values 720, 750, 780.</p>
<p>Your cell activity and recovery speed have exceeded my calculations. Suching eyes behind her glasses grew brighter and brighter, and the way she looked at Shun Yuan was no longer that of an experimental subject. A week has passed in the blink of an eye. She in blood value 990. Su Chingu looked at the final data displayed on the testing instrument, pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and her expression became more serious than ever before.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re just one step away from entering the second realm. She turned and took out a test tube that gleamed with a dark dim light from a temperature-cont controlled safe. This is dragon blood too. It is made from a 50% concentration of spinal fluid from an ancient dragon-blooded subspecies and its energy intensity is 10 times that of all the potions you have used before combined. Suching handed the dangerous test tube to Shinuan.</p>
<p>Are you ready for either instant success or instant death? Inside the enormous alloy bathtub, Shinuan took a deep breath and completely immersed himself in the strange dark green liquid. This time, Longing did not stand by and watch coldly from afar. As usual, she seemed to know the danger of this breakthrough. After a moment of silence, she quietly took off her combat jacket, revealing a black sports bra with a powerful aesthetic, and stepped into the bathtub. Seeing this, Shin Yuans anxious heart inexplicably calmed down a lot.</p>
<p>Such Ching Zu said no more and forcefully injected dragon blood number two into the water. Boom dash. An energy several times more violent than before exploded inside the bathtub. Ughai. Shinyuan scream only lasted half a sound before it abruptly stopped.</p>
<p>His eyes instantly turned bloodshot and his consciousness seemed to be gripped tightly by an invisible hand trying to tear his soul out of his body. Pain. When the pain is extreme, even thinking becomes a luxury. Just as his consciousness was about to be completely torn apart, a cold hand pressed heavily against his back. A stream of extremely pure internal energy forcefully entered his chaotic body, acting like a stabilizing force, preserving the last bit of clarity in his mind.</p>
<p>Keep your mind focused. Ly Yings icy voice exploded in his mind. If you dare to die here, I will chase you all the way to hell and pull you out so I can beat you up again with my own hands. This doineering threat of death, on the contrary, stirred up the ruthlessness in Shun Yuan&#x27;s bones. Die? I&#x27;ve only just begun to enjoy life.</p>
<p>How can I die? Roar. Shun Yuan unleashed astonishing willpower, frantically guiding the destructive medicinal power within his body, crashing against the invisible barrier deep within his dantion. Time and time again. Collide. Crash it again.</p>
<p>After an unknown amount of time, a muffled boom came from inside my body. That seemingly indestructible barrier shattered with a deafening roar. All the violent medicinal power seemed to have found an outlet, rushing wildly into the dantion, being compressed and condensed, and finally turning into a thin but extremely tough milky white stream of energy. Vitality, the mark of a second realm martial artist. Ding! Your chi and blood value has exceeded 1200.</p>
<p>Congratulations, host, on successfully advancing to the second realm martial artist. It&#x27;s done. Shinyuan opened his eyes. A powerful feeling filling his entire body. He instinctively threw a punch at the alloy wall in front of him.</p>
<p>A faint wisp of white energy emanated from his fist. Bang! With a muffled thud, a clear white fist mark was left on the special alloy wall that was strong enough to withstand heavy artillery bombardment. This is the power of vital energy. A surge of pride welled up in Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart. He was so excited that he wanted to stand up and fully experience this transformative change.</p>
<p>However, he forgot that he was still in the bathtub. His foot slipped and he fell forward uncontrollably. In his panic, his hands instinctively reached out to grab something. The entire training room fell into a deathly silence. Shin Yuan stood frozen in place, so much so that he could hear his own heart pounding wildly.</p>
<p>He moved extremely slowly, raising his head inch by inch until he met Ly Yings eyes, which had completely lost their luster. &quot;It&#x27;s over.&quot; This time, even jumping into the yellow river won&#x27;t clear my name. Before Lyings pinup anger could fully erupt, Shinuan&#x27;s brain had already provided the optimal solution. He leaped out of the bathtub with lightning speed, grabbed his clothes, and shouted righteously as he dressed, &quot;Instructor Long, I&#x27;ve broken through. I feel like my talent effect has increased more than 10fold.</p>
<p>I must go back to Chu Ran immediately, consolidate my cultivation and press my advantage. Before he finished speaking, he had already transformed into a blur and rushed out of the training room, leaving behind a stunned Su Ching Zu and Ling, whose body was trembling slightly in the bathtub and whose fists were clenched so tightly they cracked. Su Chingu adjusted her glasses and calmly recorded on the light screen. Driven by an extreme will to survive, the target bursts into speeds exceeding the sound barrier. Note, this stimulus cannot be replicated.</p>
<p>Bang! Shinuan burst through the door and immediately saw the figure that haunted his dreams. The changes in Lin Sharon after just half a month are astonishing. Nourished by the dragon&#x27;s energy and supplied with top quality nutrition, her originally pale face became rosy and delicate. Those clear eyes no longer held some unease, but rather a greater sense of spirit and confidence. Most incredibly, her already level talent seemed to have undergone a second development, filling out her silk slip dress to the brim and outlining a perfect, breathtaking curve.</p>
<p>She was sitting on the carpet by the window, basking in the sunlight, fiddling with a newly bought green plant, looking as beautiful as a painting. You come back. Lynn Sharon turned around in surprise, but before she could finish speaking, she was lifted into the air by a tremendous force. &quot;Ah!&quot; she gasped in surprise, only to find herself easily carried in Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms in a princess carry. &quot;You&#x27;re so strong today,&quot; Lin Char blushed, her small hands pressing against his firm chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Having just broken through,&quot; he was a little out of control of his power. Shin Yuan looked down at the increasingly beautiful girl in his arms, and with a mischievous grin, pecked her lips. The next morning, Shinuan opened his eyes, feeling refreshed. The physique of a second realm martial artist is indeed extraordinary. He habitually opened the system panel to check his status.</p>
<p>However, the moment the panel unfolded, a dazzling golden notification popped up, taking up the entire field of vision. Ding! Good luck. Check in progress. Detection successful. Congratulations, host.</p>
<p>The target Lynch has been successfully detected. Good luck. Total number of times, 52. Shinuan froze completely. He stared at the line of golden text, then at Lin Shuran, who was still fast asleep beside him, and his mind went blank.</p>
<p>Chapter 19. The second F-rank Divine Skill. Shin Yuan&#x27;s brain completely shut down because of that line of dazzling golden characters. It&#x27;s done. Is that all? He subconsciously looked down at the girl in his arms who was sleeping soundly with a sweet smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Just half a month. My own talent, combined with the surge in blood and chi after half a month of frantic medicinal baths to temper my body has resulted in an efficiency that is terrifyingly high. An immense joy and sense of pride welled up from the depths of my heart. Umbrella Corporation headquarters, Fortress 1. 5 minutes later, bang.</p>
<p>The valuable special alloy gate of Fortress number one was violently smashed open from the outside by a brutal force. The three of them practically turned into three after images, rushing in with an urgency completely out of character for them. The leader, Chin Lao, a rogue cultivator at the Ninth Realm, even forgot to take his precious teacup. His pair of cloudy old eyes were now surprisingly bright. Following closely behind was Xiao Jingua, a fifth level master in the company.</p>
<p>His eyes were red- rimmed, his lips were trembling, and he couldn&#x27;t utter a single word. My little darling, you better take it easy. Leian rushed to the bedside and carefully helped Lin Sharon up from Shaun Yuan&#x27;s still dazed state. All three of them simultaneously focused their gaze on Lin Char&#x27;s flat stomach. Lynch was startled by the scene and her face turned pale.</p>
<p>But when she saw the almost uncontrollable excitement on the faces of the company&#x27;s three big wigs and then looked at her own flat stomach, the clever woman instantly understood what was going on. Her cheeks flushed instantly and she lowered her head shily, her hands unconsciously protecting her lower abdomen. A wondrous and magnificent radiance quietly bloomed on her body. Shin Yuan watched this scene with a surge of heroic spirit. A thought crossed my mind.</p>
<p>The formula for the gene potential enhancement potion was projected out in the form of a virtual light screen. Old Sheen was immersed in great joy when he was suddenly struck by the golden characters that appeared before him and his pupils contracted sharply. Gene potential enhancement potion effect. After injection, the chance of awakening a talent is permanently increased by 30% for ordinary people. Ingredients: star grass, earth dragon root, rootless water, and one mace of void dragon saliva grass.</p>
<p>Old Chin&#x27;s body jolted violently. Old Chen shouted at the door. Su Chinghu. One minute later, wearing a white lab coat and red high heels, Such Ching Xu pushed open the door and entered. She was holding a tablet in her hand, which displayed Shun Yuans vital data from the previous night.</p>
<p>Old Sheen, his physical data, never mind that. Old Sheen rudely interrupted her, quickly transcribed the recipe onto a piece of paper, and then shoved it into Su Ching Xus hand. Immediately, no matter how many company resources it takes, get this thing built. Such Ching Zu took the paper with a puzzled look, and after just one glance, her brows furrowed tightly. From her perspective as a top scientist, the formula was a joke.</p>
<p>The ingredients inside, apart from the legendary void dragon saliva grass, which is quite rare, are all very common, and some can even be bought in ordinary Chinese medicine shops. Can these things alone increase an ordinary person&#x27;s chances of awakening by 30%. This completely contradicts everything she knows about genetic science? There&#x27;s probably something wrong with this recipe. She calmly voiced her doubts. Shinyuan saw through her doubts.</p>
<p>He jumped off the bed, shirtless, patted his chest, which had become more angular after a week of hellish training, and grinned, &quot;Dr. Sue, don&#x27;t doubt it. This formula isn&#x27;t something I made up.&quot; He winked at Su Chinghu and said in an extremely serious tone, &quot;This is my own child. We&#x27;re blood relatives. I&#x27;ll compensate you 10fold if it&#x27;s fake.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s guaranteed to be genuine.&quot; His words left everyone present stunned. Leun was the first to react and couldn&#x27;t help but burst out laughing. Even Lin Sharon, who had been completely bewildered, belatedly realized the meaning behind his words and buried her head in the blanket in embarrassment. Even Su Ching Xus intellectual and beautiful face showed a rare hint of surprise. Biological child blood ties.</p>
<p>How exactly does the circuitry in his brain work? Cough. Cough. Old Chin coughed twice, breaking the strange atmosphere. He grabbed Shin Yuans arm, his burning eyes filled with satisfaction as he looked at Shin Yuan. Kid, stop joking.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go to the awakening room. Let me see your second talent. Half an hour later. At the center of the core awakening array of the base, Shin Yuan took a deep breath and placed his hand on the cold awakening stone. Chin Lao, Xiaoing, Gua, Li Yun, Su Ching Xhu, and even Ling, who rushed over upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>All eyes were on him. The first talent alone created such an amazing miracle. What will the second one be? Start. As soon as ElderQ gave the order, Shin Yuan silently recited it in his mind. Use your second talent.</p>
<p>Awakening opportunity. Boom. Dash. A beam of light rose up. Its energy fluctuations startled all the powerful figures present.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breath. As the dazzling light slowly faded, the two large golden characters that slowly emerged on the awakening stone plunged the entire arena into a deathly silence. F-class. F-class. How could it be an F-class rating? Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Ziaoin, still refusing to believe it, rubbed his eyes and leaned forward to take a closer look. &quot;That&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s F-class.&quot; The gray lines representing the lowest level were crystal clear. This is impossible,&quot; Leun muttered to herself, unable to accept this outcome. Just as everyone was plunged into immense disappointment and bewilderment, the inscription on the awakening stone changed once again. A detailed description of the talent was then revealed.</p>
<p>Talent name. Get stronger through training. Rank F. Leun read it aloud without thinking. Talent effect.</p>
<p>Completing any three of the following daily activities: 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, or a 10 km run will result in a corresponding increase in chi and blood intensity, ignoring bottlenecks and upper limits. The training room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Everyone looked at Shin Yuan with an extremely strange expression. What kind of talent is this? Isn&#x27;t this just the daily exercise of an ordinary person? After a brief silence, &quot;Ha!&quot; Old Sheen slapped his thigh hard, bursting into a deafening laugh. &quot;Another one.</p>
<p>Another unreasonable rule-based talent. Winning every time is about changing the rules of good fortune. And this training makes you stronger, which is about changing the rules of becoming stronger. Ignore the bottlenecks. Ignore the limits.&quot; Kid, do you know what this means? Old Sheen&#x27;s words were like a bolt of lightning cleaving through the fog in everyone&#x27;s minds.</p>
<p>For the first time, a terrifying glint flashed in Long Yings icy Phoenix eyes. They all understood. This is hardly an F-rank talent. This is clearly yet another SSS level divine skill disguised as an F-level skill capable of overturning the entire martial arts system. As long as you persist with the most basic exercises, you can become infinitely stronger.</p>
<p>What a terrifying and unreasonable ability this is. In an instant, everyone&#x27;s expression towards Shin Yuan changed. Just then, the door to the training room was pushed open. Such walked in with a vial of freshly synthesized potion, which was emitting a strange blue halo and a faint fragrance. Her expression serious.</p>
<p>Her sharp gaze swept over the various expressions on the faces of the people present. Finally settling on Shen Yuan. The medicine is ready. The energy properties of void dragon saliva grass exceeded my expectations. It perfectly neutralized and catalyzed the energy of all the medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>She held up the blue potion in her hand, her eyes behind her glasses gleaming with rationality. In theory, it succeeded. Who will be the first to try something new? Chapter 20. My wife is a rank. The iceberg is tempted.</p>
<p>Such held up the vial of medicine that emitted a strange blue glow and everyone in the training room paused for a second. Is this the thing that gives everyone the chance to become a martial artist? In theory, it succeeded, but this is the first time, and nobody knows what the whatifs might be beyond the theory. Who will be the first to try something new? This problem weighs silently on everyone&#x27;s mind. Ziao Jingua frowned deeply, his gaze unconsciously drifting towards his wife, Lie Yun. Lie Yun gently shook her head.</p>
<p>This risk was too great. No one could easily take it. In the midst of this stagnant atmosphere, a frail figure suddenly stepped forward. It&#x27;s Lin Chur. She first glanced at Shun Yuan beside her, then stretched out her small hand, her clear eyes sparkling with determination.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll do it. Two words, gentle yet incredibly clear. Everyone present was stunned. I don&#x27;t want to always hide behind you and be protected by everyone. Lynn Sharon raised her head, meeting the astonished gazes of the crowd.</p>
<p>Her voice was still soft, yet every word was firm and resonant. I also want the power to protect children, to protect you. That last sentence was said to Shun Yuan. No, Le Yun was the first to react and she stopped her sharply. Your body absolutely cannot take any risks right now.</p>
<p>She walked quickly to Shun Yuan&#x27;s side almost pleadingly and handed over this difficult problem which was also the final decision-making power to him. Shin Yuan, you speak. In an instant, all eyes were on Shin Yuan. Xiao Jingwa, Ling, Suing Xu. Everyone wanted to see what choice this man who had created a miracle would make.</p>
<p>Shinyuan did not answer immediately. He simply looked at Lin Charly at her eyes filled with complete trust and determination. She wasn&#x27;t acting impulsively. Shin Yuan knew better than anyone the earth shattering changes that had taken place in her body over the past 2 weeks. Facing everyone&#x27;s gaze, Shinuan spoke in a deep voice.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s fine. The entire audience was stunned. Are you crazy? Lean almost jumped up. Shinyuan raised his hand, signaling her to calm down. He walked to Lynn Sharon&#x27;s side, gently took her slightly cool hand, and then turned to face the crowd with absolute confidence on his face.</p>
<p>Everyone only knows about my talent. But what you don&#x27;t know is that when I awakened this talent, an energy called dragon chi was automatically generated within my body. For the past 2 weeks, dragon chi has been continuously nourishing my body every night. Seeing the strange I understand, but I won&#x27;t say expressions on everyone&#x27;s faces, he blushed, coughed lightly, and continued to explain in a serious tone. I just secretly checked, and Chu Ran&#x27;s current chi and blood value has exceeded 300.</p>
<p>Her physique far surpasses that of ordinary people and is even stronger than many beginner martial arts apprentices. This vial of medicine might be a risk for others, but for her, it was just a catalyst for the final step. These words plunged everyone into a deathly silence of shock. Nourished by dragon energy, this talent has this hidden function. Lynn Sharon&#x27;s eyes instantly reened upon hearing Shun Yuan&#x27;s explanation.</p>
<p>It turns out he knows everything. He knew his desires and had complete faith in his abilities. This feeling of being understood and trusted made her feel warmer and happier than any sweet words. Su Ching Zhu handed over the vial of blue medicine. Lynsharin took the medicine and gave Shin Yuan a reassuring smile that could melt ice and snow.</p>
<p>Then she tilted her head back and drank the vial of medicine in one gulp. He turned and walked to the center of the awakening array. Activate the magic circle. With a command given, Su Chingu pressed the switch. Buzz.</p>
<p>A dazzling cyan beam of light rose up. The light, full of life, gentle yet powerful, illuminated the entire training room, turning it into an emerald colored ocean. As the light faded, a new line of large golden characters clearly appeared on the awakening stone. Tier A talent owed to life. Talent effect can catalyze plant growth, can greatly heal injuries, can apply a life blessing to friendly targets, and increase strength by 20%.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s done. Moreover, it is an extremely rare A-level talent in the healing and buffing tree. In some aspects, the strategic value of an A-level healer can even far exceed that of a powerful offensive martial artist of the same level. It really increased the awakening chance by 30%. Such stared at the final data displayed on the screen, muttering to herself.</p>
<p>For the first time, a look of confusion appeared on her face, which was usually etched with rationality and confidence. This completely overturns existing genetics. She turned to look at Shun Yuan, her gaze burning intensely. That man is the root of all irrationality. Ding.</p>
<p>Target Su Ching Xus research interest value plus 30%. Current progress 65%. A notification sound rang in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. Looking at Su Ching Xus fanatical appearance, as if she wanted to tie him to the experimental table and dissect him for research, he felt a chill run down his spine. On the other side, Longing stood in the corner.</p>
<p>The shock she felt was more intense than anyone else&#x27;s. An ordinary girl with no talent simply because she became pregnant with Shun Yuan&#x27;s child and was nourished by his dragon energy eventually rose to the top and awakened an A-level talent. Right before our eyes is a living example, doubt wavering? No. At this moment, only one thought remained in Lyings mind. This man truly has the ability to create miracles.</p>
<p>She looked at Shun Yuan, but her gaze was no longer that of scrutinizing a mission target or evaluating a weapon. It was a complex emotion, a way of looking up to one&#x27;s own kind, even with a hint of reverence. Ding. Target L Yings favorability increased by 20%, current favorability 74%. Icebreaking progress 25%.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan was overjoyed, 74%, just 11% more, and we&#x27;ll be able to completely conquer this iceberg. Chapter 21. Painful yet joyful training. Icebreaker progress 40%. The next day, just as dawn was breaking, Shin Yuan was lifted off the bed by Lang.</p>
<p>He now has a psychological aversion to this icy female instructor, and with messy hair and sleepy eyes, he followed her into the empty training room. Starting today, we will officially begin the daily training for F-level talents. Longing read the training plan in her hand expressionlessly, her voice as cold as she was. Shin Yuan yawned lazily laid down on the ground and assumed a push-up position. Just when Longing thought he was about to start, he suddenly looked up and gave her a sly smile.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, I remember it clearly. You were to use every means possible to fully cooperate with my training. L Yings pretty face instantly turned even colder. She could, of course, understand the unspoken meaning behind his words. So what? So Shan Yuan deliberately dragged out his words, his smile growing even brighter.</p>
<p>Talk is cheap. Why don&#x27;t you come up and put some pressure on me? The air in the training room seemed to freeze because of those words. Long Yings pretty face instantly turned cold. She was about to reprimand him when that profound sentence involuntarily echoed in her mind. You guys need to hurry up.</p>
<p>If all else fails, you can try making it a fat accompany. Considering Shin Yuans two completely unreasonable F-level talents and Lin Sharons living example, Longing slowly relaxed her clenched fist. Under Shin Yuans astonished gaze, she walked silently to his side without saying a word. Then she did something that made Shin Yuans heart skip a beat. She bent down and deafly untied the laces of her military boots, pulling her feet out of the black military socks.</p>
<p>Without the confinement of military boots, her jade-like feet were revealed, delicate in shape with a smooth and cool arch and rounded toes that did not appear soft, only showing a healthy pink hue, full of the neat beauty unique to ice queens. Longing seemed a little uncomfortable with stepping barefoot on the cold mat, and her jade-like feet subconsciously curled up. The next second, she lifted her foot under Shun Yuans stiff gaze. His dash. Shin Yuan gasped.</p>
<p>A faint, delicate fragrance lingered around his nose. What are you still standing there for? Long Yings icy voice came from above. You want pressure? Then get to training. Okay. Shin Yuan roared instantly becoming full of energy.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, his arms bulging with veins and painstakingly completed his first push-up. Sweat poured down instantly. One, two, three. Shun Yuan gritted his teeth, sweat trickling down his forehead and dripping onto the mat, but his mind was screaming wildly. It was worth it.</p>
<p>This hellish training was  worth it. 99 100. When he finished the last push-up, Shin Yuan felt like his arms were about to break, and he collapsed to the ground with a thud. Longing withdrew her foot, quickly put on her military boots, and a faint blush rose on her pretty face, but her tone remained cold. Next sit-ups.</p>
<p>Shinyuan laid down on the mat as instructed and just as he was about to begin, Longing came over and pinned him down. She reached out and placed her hands on his shoulders. Start. Shinyuan sister, are you helping me with training or taking advantage of me? This is too close. He could even see Ly Yings ears turning slightly red with embarrassment and annoyance.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, aren&#x27;t you a bit too heavy? Shin Yuan blurted out, asking a question that seemed to have no bearing on his mind. Long Yings hand on his shoulder suddenly increased in pressure, almost digging into his flesh. Say it again. I told you the weight was just right. It perfectly stimulated my core strength.</p>
<p>So professional. Shin Yuan&#x27;s survival instinct kicked in, and he immediately changed his tune, then frantically started doing sit-ups. Every time he got up, he would inevitably get close to that beautiful icy face so close to his own, and he could even smell the faint fragrance emanating from her. What kind of wonderful training is this? The final 10 km run was even changed by Ling to squats. Carry me on your back, a hundred of you.</p>
<p>Ly Yings order was not to be questioned. Shiny Yuan felt as if he was carrying not a person, but a red hot iron, constantly testing his willpower. Straighten your back. Tighten your core. Ly Yings voice was right next to his ear.</p>
<p>Her warm breath brushing against his earlobe, making him feel a surge of desire. I know Shinuan was gritting his teeth. sweat pouring down his face. Instructor Long, what did you eat to grow up like this? That&#x27;s a huge portion. Shut up.</p>
<p>Focus on training. When he finished the last squat, Shinuan&#x27;s vision went black and he almost collapsed to his knees. Longing nimblely jumped off his back, the blush on her pretty face spreading to her neck, but she still looked at him as if he were a greenhorn. She walked to the door, placed her hand on the doornob, and suddenly stopped without turning around. Today&#x27;s training volume was too light.</p>
<p>Her voice sounded a little strained. All projects will double tomorrow. The door slammed shut. Shinyuan was the only one left in the training room. He looked at the closed door and grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>Ding. Target long Yings favorability increased by 4%. Current favorability 78%. Icebreaking progress 40%. Doubled.</p>
<p>I like. Chapter 22. The night of unemployment. On the other side of the training room, Su Ching Zhu pushed up her gold rimmed glasses. Her intelligent and beautiful face now filled with a shock that defied scientific explanation.</p>
<p>She stared at the data curve on the screen which was rising at an almost 90° angle. Chi and blood value 1345. This is insane. This is absolutely insane. In just one morning, without using any gene serums or high energy nutrient solutions, his blood and chi value suddenly increased by 150 points.</p>
<p>This is not science. This is theology. Su Ching Xu looked at the man being cruy trained by Ling in a way that was almost humiliating. Her eyes growing brighter and her breathing becoming rapid. She felt like she had discovered a new continent.</p>
<p>Ding. Target Su Ching Xus research interest value plus 7%. Current progress 72%. Nightfalls. As Shun Yuan soaked in the speciallymade restorative medicinal bath, he felt as if every cell in his body which had been drained during the day was cheering with joy.</p>
<p>The fatigue vanished, replaced by an almost overflowing, inexhaustible energy. With the physique of a second realm martial artist, coupled with the bugle level talent of becoming stronger through training, he felt that he could now punch through the alloy walls of the base. However, the more fulfilling the daytime is, the emptier the nighttime is. He returned to his fortress where Lin Sharon was engrossed in reading a book about prenatal education. Although her abdomen was still flat, she radiated a gentle maternal glow.</p>
<p>Seeing him return, Lynn Sharon happily greeted him and gave him a firm hug. Then, like a startled rabbit, cautiously distanced herself. It&#x27;s obvious they&#x27;re wary of messing around again. A warm feeling welled up and shun Yuan&#x27;s heart, but it was followed by endless emptiness and restlessness. He paced restlessly in the fortress, feeling like an energetic tiger trapped in a cage with nowhere to expend his strength.</p>
<p>The other two top goddesses, one is Ling, whose favorability rating is stuck at 78% just one step away from being completely won over. But that iceberg obviously cannot be melted by words alone. The other Sue Chingu had a research interest score of 72%. But the research fanatic looked at her as if she were a lab rat, showing far more interest in her body than in her as a person. Just as I was getting annoyed, the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Le Yun. She was carrying some top quality supplements for pregnant women when she entered the room and saw Shin Yuan scratching his head and looking restless. Hey, what&#x27;s wrong? You want a battle? Aren&#x27;t you happy? Lean covered her mouth and giggled, her eyes sparkling. When Shin Yuan saw her, it was as if he had seen a savior. He rushed over and grabbed her hand, pouring out his grievances.</p>
<p>Sister Le Yun, I feel like I&#x27;ve lost my job. He pointed to himself, then to the direction of the bedroom, his face filled with a mixture of grief and indignation. Puff. Leun was so amused by his righteous and witty remarks that she almost fell over. I laughed for a long time.</p>
<p>Leun steadied herself against the wall, wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes, and her expression turned strange. You wait half an hour later. Lean returned to Shun Yuan&#x27;s fortress once again. She looked at Shin Yuan with a strange expression on her face, a mixture of wanting to laugh and having to maintain a serious demeanor. Shinyuan, here.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan immediately stood up straight, his face full of anticipation. Li Yun cleared her throat and announced in an extremely solemn tone. You are hereby granted the privilege of going out freely at night. After Lie Yun finished speaking, she took out a futuristic looking hover car key and an inconspicuous black earring from her pocket and stuffed the three items into Shun Yuans hand. She winked at Shun Yuan, her voice carrying a hint of seduction.</p>
<p>Outside the company base, our people will secretly protect your safety 24 hours a day. Go out and explore. Tonight, the entire city of Dong Hai is your hunting ground. But don&#x27;t squander your capital on the very first night. Shinuan gripped the cold key, feeling as if all the blood in his body was burning.</p>
<p>At that moment, I walked to the huge floor toseeiling window and looked out at the brightly lit, bustling city that resembled a sea of stars. Free. What does a man desire most? It is unrestrained freedom and full of unknown excitement. Shin Yuan&#x27;s lips curled into an incredibly ostentatious smile. on the little prince of the night.</p>
<p>Grabbing his coat under Lean&#x27;s teasing gaze, Shin Yuan put on an inconspicuous black earring and rushed out of the fortress without looking back. Chapter 23. Touching a fake spy, terrified, head straight to the base&#x27;s private underground parking garage. Press the button on the key. Buzz.</p>
<p>Deep inside the garage, a dark shadow slipped out of the shadows and silently stopped in front of him. Shadow beetle. The entire body is covered with a matte black coating that absorbs light and the body lines are full of wild muscle and the coldness of futuristic technology. It has no wheels. The entire body is suspended half a meter off the ground.</p>
<p>And the deep humming energy sounds like the breathing of an ancient behemoth in its slumber. Shinyuan whistled, walked around the car, and reached out to touch the cold body of the vehicle. goodness. The base model costs 100 million and the company&#x27;s modifications would probably cost an extra zero. He opened the car door and plopped inside.</p>
<p>The memory gel material in the driver&#x27;s seat automatically adjusted to his body shape, fitting him perfectly and making him so comfortable that he wanted to take a nap right there. The center console has no physical buttons, only a solid black crystal screen. The screen lights up the moment he sits down and a soft electronic female voice sounds. Identity verification successful. Welcome, Mr.</p>
<p>Shinuan. Shadow Beetle is at your service. Shinyuan grinned and gripped the futuristic looking steering wheel with both hands. This is what life is all about. He stepped on the energy pedal.</p>
<p>Call out. The black beetle transformed into a streak of light too thin for the naked eye to see. Instantly shooting out of the underground parking garage exit and merging into the dazzling steel forest of Donghai City. Driving on the main road of the busiest commercial district at night, the shadow beetles imposing appearance and deep roar are the most doineering pass. All the vehicles, regardless of brand or luxury car, acted like mice seeing a cat, slowing down and frantically moving to the sides to make way for him, clearing a clear path to the center of attention.</p>
<p>Pedestrians on the roadside stopped in their tracks, took out their phones, and frantically took pictures. Their gazes filled with a mixture of awe, envy, jealousy, and intense curiosity. Holy crap, what kind of car is that? When did Donghai City get these monsters? I&#x27;ve never seen that car logo before, but judging from its aura, it&#x27;s definitely a special product from a top tier family. Shin Yuan rested one hand on the steering wheel and the other casually on the edge of the car window, enjoying the thrill of being the center of attention, his heart brimming with pride. In just half a month, he went from being a useless F-class player to driving a top-of-the-line luxury car and making headlines throughout the city.</p>
<p>This feeling is even better than breaking through to the second realm of martial arts. He deliberately parked his car in front of the most luxurious shopping mall in the city center, the place with the highest density of beautiful women in the entire Donghai city. Shin Yuan rolled down the car window, took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and leaned lazily back in the driver&#x27;s seat, blowing a smoke ring out of the window. The bait has been cast. Now it&#x27;s just a matter of when the fish will take the bait.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t even need to wait 30 seconds. Almost the instant he parked his car, a dozen or so beautifully dressed women who had been watching him closely for a long time swarmed around the shadow beetle like sharks smelling blood, completely surrounding it. The strong perfume scents mixed together almost made Shin Yuan die on the spot. Hey bro, all alone. Want to grab a drink tonight with some green bubble tea? Hey handsome, look at me.</p>
<p>I just finished my live stream. Let&#x27;s chat about our life goals. One after another, meticulously drawn green bubble QR codes were eagerly handed to him, accompanied by cloyingly sweet voices. Shinuan raised the corner of his mouth, flicked the cigarette but out of the car, and slowly opened his mouth. Don&#x27;t rush.</p>
<p>Take it one at a time. A playful smile appeared on his face, which had become even more handsome after the tempering. I&#x27;m a believer in fate, so I have to touch hands and look at palm lines to know if we&#x27;re compatible. Far from being offended by these words, the girl&#x27;s eyes lit up even more. A hot, internet famous woman wearing a revealing tank top was the first to squeeze to the front and reach her fair, delicate hand in.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, bro, can you take a look at my palm? Does this mean I&#x27;m destined to marry into a wealthy family?&quot; Shinuan took her small hand in a serious manner and gently squeezed it. In his mind, a golden panel instantly unfolded. Target: Wong Xiaomé. Age: 22. Talent: None.</p>
<p>Appearance rating 87. Technology and ruthless skills. Body rating 89. Human waistline wonder 128 times. Overall rating 88.</p>
<p>Very good. Shin Yuan released his grip without showing any emotion and then spoke nonsense with a straight face. Girl, your career path is good, but your love life is a bit messy and inconsistent. Next. Huh? Wong Xiaomi stepped back with a disappointed look.</p>
<p>Seeing this, other beauties followed suit one after another. Just then, a mature and beautiful woman wearing a black tight- fitting pencil skirt and black stockings boldly squeezed in. She grabbed Shinuan&#x27;s hand, but instead of letting him read her palm, she directly guided his hand to her thighs, which were covered in black stockings. Hey, bro, how can you tell if someone is sincere just by touching your hand? Her breath was sweet, and her eyes were captivating. Legs are a woman&#x27;s second face.</p>
<p>This move instantly ignited the atmosphere in the entire venue. Yeah. Hey buddy, feel my waist. It&#x27;s incredibly slim. And me? I have the most sincere offer here.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman puffed out her proud breasts. The scene was extremely chaotic at one point. Shinyuan quickly browsed through the data provided by the system. He was enjoying it. Just when I felt overwhelmed by the choices, two stunningly beautiful women who looked exactly alike and had such perfect proportions that it seemed unreal suddenly squeezed to the front.</p>
<p>They were wearing matching white dresses with sweet and innocent smiles on their faces and called out sweetly to Shin Yuan. Hey bro, can you take a look for us, too? Shiny Yuan&#x27;s eyes lit up. This is a rare breed. Without hesitation, he reached out and placed one hand on each of the two sisters soft hands. However, the moment his fingers touched the other person&#x27;s skin, beep, warning, warning, the system in his mind suddenly issued a piercing red alarm and the entire virtual panel was stained blood red.</p>
<p>Lines of shocking text were jumping wildly. Warning, target detected as a fake human. Manufacturer Life Foundation body configuration equipped with a seventh generation artificial prosthesis and a highfrequency pheromone emitter. It will automatically steal all of the host genetic information and upload it to a cloud database in the event of gene exchange while simultaneously activating a remote monitoring module. Extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Shinyuan&#x27;s face turned pale instantly. I felt like every hair on my body stood on end at that moment. These aren&#x27;t innocent twins at all. They&#x27;re clearly two humanoid walking bombs disguised in human skin, ready to explode at any moment. He jerked his hand back as if he&#x27;d been electrocuted.</p>
<p>As if he&#x27;d touched not a beautiful woman&#x27;s prosthetic hand, but two highly venomous cobras. I just did a quick calculation, and all of your birth charts clash with mine. Goodbye. Before he could finish speaking, he slammed his foot down on the energy pedal. Amidst the stunned and bewildered gazes of the group of beauties, the black shadow beetle roared and instantly transformed into a streak of light, fleeing at an almost teleportation speed, leaving only a gust of wind in its wake.</p>
<p>Inside the car, Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart pounded wildly, and his back was already soaked with cold sweat. He glanced at the bustling street behind him through the rear view mirror. The two fake figures remained standing in the same spot, a great distance apart, each giving him the same eerie yet sweet smile. Shin Yuan shivered and stepped on the pedal to accelerate again. Life Foundation.</p>
<p>What kind of organization is this? Are these fake humans created specifically to steal genetic information, actually targeting high-v valueue individuals like themselves? Shinuan suddenly realized that Le Yun had probably asked him to come out, not just to find girls. Beneath the shadows of this bustling metropolis lurks a danger he can&#x27;t even imagine. Chapter 24. The Black Widow in the bar. Who could resist that? The shadow beetle traced a ghostly arc across the highway, and Shun Yuan finally felt his wildly beating heart calm down a little.</p>
<p>He raised his hand and touched the warm, smooth dragon soul jade on his neck, feeling a wave of fear wash over him. &quot;Life foundation,&quot; Shin Yuan muttered the unfamiliar name, his expression turning serious. This bustling metropolis is like a dark forest fraught with danger. And he, a Tang monk with extraordinary treasures, is the ultimate prey in the eyes of all hunters. However, the more dangerous it is, the more exciting it is.</p>
<p>Shinuan did not back down. Instead, his competitive spirit was aroused. Danger as it may be, the mission must continue. We can&#x27;t just turn back home because we&#x27;re scared by two mannequins. That would be too embarrassing.</p>
<p>He composed himself, turned on the car&#x27;s light screen, and began searching for nightlife landmarks in Dongghai City. A name quickly caught his attention. Phantom Bar. The online reviews of it can be summed up in one word, awesome. It said that the DJs and dancers inside are all top-notch beauties who can make you drool, and they sway and twist their hips on various short video platforms every day, keeping their popularity high.</p>
<p>This kind of place is a mixed bag, but the density of beautiful women is absolutely topnotch. Let&#x27;s go. Shin Yuan stepped on the energy pedal and the black beetle once again merged into the city&#x27;s neon lit sea of light. At the entrance of the phantom bar, deafening music and frenzied noise almost shook the heavens. The shadow beetle silently glided to the doorway.</p>
<p>The automatic parking system activated and the car autonomously sank into its designated underground parking space. Shinuan, dressed in simple casual clothes, strolled toward the dazzling gate. Two security guards in suits stood at the entrance, tall and composed with slightly bulging temples. Shinuan glanced at them and immediately judged that both of them were at least second level martial artists. Using a second realm martial artist as a doorman, this bar setup is quite interesting.</p>
<p>When the two saw Shin Yuan approaching, they exchanged a glance and immediately stepped forward. Shin Yuan was taken aback. There are probably no more than 10 shadow beetles like mine in the entire Donghai city. Logically speaking, it should be the highest level of pass. So why was I stopped? However, the two security guards did not make any move to stop him.</p>
<p>Instead, they bowed in unison a step away from him. Their attitude extremely respectful. Sir, please wait a moment. This maneuver left even Shinuan stumped. Before he could speak, a woman with a voluuptuous and alluring figure wearing a sexy Chong Sam with a high slit quickly came out of the bar in high heels to greet him.</p>
<p>She wore a professional yet charming smile and gave Shin Yuan a slight bow. We are deeply sorry for our poor hospitality. Please follow me. The proprie has prepared the best rooftop starry sky room for you. I see.</p>
<p>Shinuan then suddenly realized what was going on. It turns out they didn&#x27;t look down on him. They thought too highly of him. It seems that the shadow beetle was recognized by the bar&#x27;s intelligence system when it entered the parking area and was directly reported as a tople VIP. That&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>He followed the female manager, bypassing the noisy and crowded lobby, and entered a private sightseeing elevator. Inside the elevator, the female manager&#x27;s alluring eyes kept glancing at him, and the scent of her perfume wafted over intentionally or unintentionally. &quot;Sir, you look unfamiliar. Is this your first time visiting Phantom?&quot; &quot;Hm, I&#x27;ve heard this place is nice, so I came to check it out.&quot; Shin Yuan replied casually. &quot;Then you&#x27;ve come to the right place.&quot; The female manager covered her mouth and chuckled, unconsciously, moving half a step closer to him, almost pressing against him.</p>
<p>&quot;We guarantee you&#x27;ll want to stay here forever.&quot; The elevator jolted slightly, and the female manager cried out in surprise as if she had lost her balance and fell into Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms. Shin Yuan naturally supported her slender waist. Almost simultaneously, a panel popped up in my mind. Target LinMay. Age 28.</p>
<p>Realm Second Realm Martial Artist. Appearance rating 91. Master of subtle adjustments. Body type rating 94. A model of hard work.</p>
<p>Number of times 666. Overall rating 93. Extremely beautiful. 93 points. Shinyuan raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>This score is quite high and the number of times it was chosen is also quite auspicious. He casually pinched her waist, enjoying the firm touch and indulging in his pleasure. Lynn may let out a soft moan in his arms, her eyes becoming even more watery. Gentlemen, you can barely stand. It seems you were a bit tired last night, manager.</p>
<p>Shinuan straightened her up, let go of her hand, and smiled playfully. Remember to rest next time. A blush crept onto Lin May&#x27;s cheeks. She gave him a reproachful look, but dared not make any further moves. The elevator doors opened, revealing a quiet corridor covered with a dark red carpet.</p>
<p>The starry sky palace at the end truly lived up to its reputation. The entire room&#x27;s dome is a complete holographic projection screen simulating a deep and dazzling starry sky, slowly rotating, which is beautiful and magnificent. Shin Yuan sat down on the leather sofa with an air of nonchulence, and the female manager immediately handed him a highquality electronic menu. He casually flipped through the items and discovered that the drinks and food were divided into two completely different categories, ordinary and those exclusively for martial artists. The dishes specially prepared for martial artists use the blood and flesh of ferocious beasts rich in energy.</p>
<p>Through special cooking, they can nourish the blood and chi. The wines are brewed with various rare medicinal herbs and have the effect of tempering vital energy. Good heavens, this isn&#x27;t a bar. It&#x27;s practically a den of iniquity for martial artists. Shin Yuan, feeling playful, handed the menu back to the female manager and spoke in a nonchalant tone.</p>
<p>Bring out your most expensive blood ram and that dragon tendon set meal. The female manager&#x27;s charming smile froze for a moment. She cautiously reminded him. Sir, the total price of these two items you ordered has exceeded 2 million credits. Shin Yuan was too lazy to waste words with her, so he simply took out the pure black metal card with a golden dragon pattern printed on it from his pocket and casually threw it on the table.</p>
<p>Swipe card pin 68. The female manager&#x27;s gaze fell on the black card and her professional fawning smile froze instantly, her pupils shrinking to pinpoints. The next second, she bowed deeply, almost reflexively, her voice even changing tone, and her fingers were trembling when she picked up the communicator. She lowered her voice and reported urgently in a tone mixed with awe and panic. Boss lady, top floor, long card is a long card VIP.</p>
<p>Soon, the expensive blood lamb and the set meal made with the tendons of the tier three ferocious beast, the earth dragon, were served. Shun yuan leisurely swirled the blood red liquid in his glass, took a sip, and felt a surge of fiery energy slide down his throat into his stomach, making every pore on his body open up. As expected of something made exclusively for martial artists, it&#x27;s really powerful. He savored the fine wine and food while waiting with curiosity. Who exactly is this mysterious propriet who can open such a place and recognize dragon cards so quickly he didn&#x27;t have to wait too long.</p>
<p>A series of crisp rhythmic high heels clicking on the ground came from afar. Along with the sound came a rich and aggressive perfume scent. The door to the starry sky palace was pushed open. A woman walked in. With just one glance, Shinuan felt his breath catch in his throat.</p>
<p>The woman who walked in was a western beauty, wearing a black, tight-fitting leather dress that fit her perfectly, highlighting her almost exaggeratedly voluuptuous figure. The lines are full of a powerful, captivating presence. And paired with that cold, aloof aura, she is like a poisonous young woman, alluring yet deadly. Her long wavy wine red hair was casually draped over her shoulders, making her skin appear even whiter. Her features were deep and defined.</p>
<p>Her azure eyes were like two of the purest sapphires, and beneath her high, straight nose were full, sensual red lips. That appearance, that demeanor, that figure, she bears a striking resemblance to the female agent cenamed Black Widow from the movies in Shun Yuan&#x27;s previous life. Seven or eight points. Absolutely top-notch,&quot; Shinuan thought to himself. &quot;If this were a rating, it would definitely be 95 points or higher, maybe even higher.</p>
<p>We apologize for keeping our distinguished guests waiting.&quot; The woman walked in, her voice languid and magnetic with just the right amount of huskiness, enough to make one&#x27;s bones melt just by listening to it. She proactively extended her fair and slender hand. &quot;I&#x27;m the owner here. You can call me Mrs. Red.&quot; Shin Yuan suppressed his amazement, put on a polite yet playful smile, and reached out to shake her hand.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan, the moment their palms touched. The system panel in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind appeared automatically. However, the content that surfaced this time caused the smile on his face to freeze slightly. Chapter 25. A federal female spy with a score of 96.</p>
<p>Uncle Xiao. You predicted it, didn&#x27;t you? Target: Natasha, code name, Black Widow. Age 26. Talent: mental charm rank A. Realm Grand Marshall Master of the Third Realm.</p>
<p>Appearance rating 96. Goddess level. Body rating 97. Devilish curves. Status pure single.</p>
<p>Overall rating 95 due to Black Widow&#x27;s genetic modification. She is permanently inoperable. Rating minus one. Shin Yuan&#x27;s smile froze when he saw the last line of small print. Permanently shut down.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#x27;t his core talent of being able to hit the bulls every time be wasted on this stunning mature woman? What a waste of her 96-point looks and 97 point figure. Just as he was lamenting his loss, the text on the system panel began flashing wildly and a blinding crimson color instantly covered the entire screen. System assessment. High-risk target. A top spy for the Free Federation.</p>
<p>System suggestion. This target is extremely dangerous and unable to complete the reproductive task. The host is advised to engage in passive aggressive behavior. Although she is exceptionally attractive, she cannot have children. It is recommended to treat her as a hobby and not take it seriously.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s mind went blank for a moment and he almost crashed on the spot just for fun. System, you&#x27;re  audacious. He maintained his nonchalant smile, holding Natasha&#x27;s hand and even giving it a gentle squeeze. Lady Hong is indeed a stunning beauty. Seeing her in person is far better than hearing about her.</p>
<p>At the same time, he had already connected directly to Lie Yun and Xiao Jingga&#x27;s channels through a company grade brainwave communicator implanted in his brain via an earring. Sister Lee, Uncle Xiao, we&#x27;ve won the lottery. I&#x27;ve spotted a spy. She&#x27;s at the Phantom Bar. I&#x27;m sending her information panel there.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, he packaged up the data of the two strange imposters he had encountered at the Life Foundation and sent it to Le Yun, Ziao Jingua, and Longing, respectively. There are also two guys from the Life Foundation. They&#x27;re not very strong, but they&#x27;re very strange. They don&#x27;t seem like real people. Investigate them, too.</p>
<p>Master bedroom in the living quarters of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters. An enchanting atmosphere permeated the air. Having shed her military uniform, Leu now wore only a black lace slip dress, leaning languidly against the headboard. Her long hair, usually styled in a bun, fell loose, framing her mature face and giving her a uniquely captivating charm. Xiao Jingwa, revealing his explosive muscles, pulled out a delicate little wooden box from a hidden compartment under the bed with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>He leaned close to the bedside and opened the box as if presenting a treasure. Yun, look what this is. Le Yun cast a curious glance and saw a red pill the size of a long lying in the box, emitting a strange fragrance. This is the tiger wolf pill that old Chin gave me last time. He said it can greatly increase the chances of conceiving twins.</p>
<p>Xiaoing rubbed his hands together, laughing like a 300-lb child. Since that day, Lean has been so busy that she barely has time to rest. She and her husband haven&#x27;t had a chance to. Leans pretty face flushed red instantly. She gave Xiao Jingwa a reproachful look, and the charm in her eyes made Zia Jingwa feel hot all over.</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands excitedly, about to pounce on her. Just then, without warning, Shin Yuans urgent voice and a crystal clearar golden panel projection simultaneously rang in their minds. Snap! Xiao Jingwas hand trembled, and the small wooden box containing the tiger wolf pill fell straight onto the carpet. The charming and shy expression on Lean&#x27;s face froze instantly. The next second, she glared fiercely at the air, as if she wanted to drag that inappropriate brat out and beat him up.</p>
<p>But her movements were surprisingly fast. She rolled off the bed, grabbed the coat next to her, and put it on, and the charm in her eyes vanished instantly, replaced by sharpness and calmness. Xiaoing was struck dumb. He frantically started putting on his pants, then angrily burst into a tirade. That brat, of all times to come, why now of all times? Did he plan this perfectly? Shut up, Li Yun gave a low shout, her gaze locking onto the virtual screen.</p>
<p>A grand marshall master spy with A-level talent. They really did reach in. Xiao Jingwa calmed down, put on his pants, and spoke in a deep voice. This is definitely a big fish. The Federation sent an ace of this caliber.</p>
<p>It seems they&#x27;re determined to cause trouble. Lean&#x27;s gaze fell on another report about the Life Foundation, and her expression grew increasingly grim. The Life Foundation, those lunatics, also came. She gritted her teeth and said, &quot;These guys don&#x27;t belong to any faction. They don&#x27;t even belong to Earth.</p>
<p>Their android beauties are endless. Their infiltration capabilities are extremely strong. They&#x27;re even more troublesome than the Federation spies. Keep her calm. Don&#x27;t show any abnormality.</p>
<p>Pretend you know nothing. Inside the Starry Sky Palace. The moment Shin Yuan received the instruction, he knew what to expect. He released Madame Hongs hand, leaned back lazily on the sofa, and pointed to the seat opposite him. Lady Red, please sit.</p>
<p>His tone made it seem as if you were the master of the place. A hint of surprise flashed in Lady Red&#x27;s azure eyes, but she still obediently sat down opposite him. Her incredibly long legs encased in a black leather skirt elegantly crossed. &quot;Mr. Shan has such a powerful aura.</p>
<p>I wonder which family in Donghai he is. Just a nobody.&quot; Shin yuan swirled the blood rum in his glass, his answer perfectly watertight. looking at the stunning beauty across from him who was scrutinizing him with an inquisitive gaze. Shin Yuans lips curled into an even brighter smile. Lady Red, drinking alone is too boring.</p>
<p>He patted the sofa next to him. Come here and have a drink with me. This almost commanding tone stunned Lady Red once again. She had been infiltrating the East China Sea for a year and had met many young masters and science of noble families. But she had never met anyone like Shin Yuan, who despite being only a second realm martial artist, possessed a dragon card and was so presumptuous in front of her.</p>
<p>Interesting. She made her own assessment in her mind, but a charming smile appeared on her face. She picked up her wine glass, stood up, and walked with the graceful steps of a cat to Shun Yuan&#x27;s side. Sitting down close to him, a rich fragrance instantly enveloped Shin Yuan. How would Mr.</p>
<p>Shen like to drink it? Her breath was fragrant, and her azure eyes shimmerred with tears. Shin Yuan reached out and lifted her smooth chin, forcing her to look him in the eye. I don&#x27;t like beating around the bush. He stared directly into those captivating blue eyes, speaking slowly and deliberately. You&#x27;re mine tonight.</p>
<p>Domineering, direct, and unreasonable. For the first time, genuine astonishment was revealed in Hung Fus azure eyes. She had imagined countless ways to approach and test the waters. But she never expected that the other party would use such a brutal and direct method to tear away all the pretense. This completely disrupted her rhythm.</p>
<p>But she was, after all, a top agent, and after only a second of distraction, she regained her languid and charming demeanor. Instead of resisting, she leaned her entire soft body into Shun Yuans arms and wrapped her arms around his neck. Okay. Her red lips brushed against Shun Yuans ear, her voice filled with bewitching magic. As long as Mr.</p>
<p>Shan can handle it, she emphasized the last word heavily, and before she finished speaking, an invisible spiritual force, like a silent thread, quietly pierced into the depths of Shan Yuan&#x27;s mind. A great talent, mental charm, launch. That mental power, powerful enough to make even a martial artist at the third realm lose their senses, entered Shin Yuan&#x27;s mind the instant, but it vanished without a trace, like a clay ox sinking into the sea without even a bubble appearing. Joke. He has a lucky streak system living in his head that even elder can&#x27;t figure out.</p>
<p>Forget about a level mental charm. Even if it were an SSS level one, they would have to kneel down. Shin Yuan noticed the perfect smile on the face of the stunning beauty in his arms and froze for a mere tenth of a second. A look of disbelief and horror flashed in the depths of her deep ocean blue eyes. It failed.</p>
<p>No, it&#x27;s not a failure. It&#x27;s annihilation. My mental energy vanished completely before it could even touch the other person&#x27;s mental barrier. How is that possible? Chapter 26. The movie star is possessed playing this female spy.</p>
<p>Even if one cannot fully control their A-level mental charm against a martial artist of the same level, it is enough to make the opponent&#x27;s mind waver and fall into a brief illusion. But the man in front of me didn&#x27;t react at all. Natasha&#x27;s inner alarm bells were ringing. It&#x27;s broken, silent, and still without even a ripple. This is not normal.</p>
<p>Even a grand marshall master of the third realm would be momentarily stunned if caught off guard by her close-range attack. But the man in front of me had a frighteningly clear gaze, even with a hint of mockery. Is his mental strength inherently ridiculously strong, or does he possess a top tier mental defense treasure? In an instant, several thoughts flashed through her mind, but the alluring expression on her face remained unchanged. &quot;What&#x27;s wrong, little brother? Are you stunned by your sister&#x27;s beauty?&quot; Shin yuan sneered inwardly. &quot;You think you can use your mental powers against me? Give me a break.&quot; He was too lazy to play any more games with her.</p>
<p>He suddenly grabbed her and with a suppressed gasp from Natasha scooped up her voluuptuous and alluring body. Terrified, Shin Yuan chuckled softly, the playfulness in his eyes, turning into naked aggression. Your skills are still lacking. Natasha&#x27;s body stiffened for a moment, then went limp again. The little brother is so strong.</p>
<p>Her eyes were alluring, seemingly completely unconcerned about the mischievous hand. Whether you&#x27;re strong or not, you&#x27;ll know once you try. Shiny Yuan used his other hand to pinch her chin, forcing her to lift her face. He felt the delicate touch with his fingertips, his face showing undisguised frivvality. &quot;That skin, that figure.</p>
<p>Wow, she&#x27;s way better than any of the female warriors I&#x27;ve seen at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters.&quot; He deliberately showed a hint of disgust. Those women only know how to train all day long, and they&#x27;ve all become as hard as rocks, so hard to the touch. They&#x27;re nothing compared to you. so soft and fragrant. Leun, who was listening in, &quot;Umbrella Corporation headquarters.&quot; These two words were like a key, instantly unlocking a door in Natasha&#x27;s heart.</p>
<p>A glint of light flashed deep within her as your eyes. &quot;Oh my, so this little brother works for the Umbrella Corporation. No wonder he&#x27;s so manly,&quot; Natasha asked, judging from your car and its imposing presence. &quot;You must be a young genius who commands respect and has the final say inside, right, genius?&quot; Shinyuan seemed to have been hit where it hurt. The flippency on his face vanished instantly, replaced by a twisted expression that was a mixture of resentment and jealousy.</p>
<p>What a load of bull. He shoved the beauty in his arms away, grabbed the blood rum on the table, and took a big gulp, then slammed the crystal goblet heavily onto the table. Bang! Expensive wine was splashed everywhere. Among the new recruits in this company, I&#x27;m only second to none. This sudden outburst of rage stunned Natasha, but she was overjoyed.</p>
<p>He really is someone from Umbrella Corporation and someone with access to the inner circle. Oh. Natasha&#x27;s eyes sparkled with intense curiosity as she leaned closer and softly pressed for an answer. What kind of person could be so superior to you? I&#x27;m so curious. These words were exactly what Shin Yuan wanted to hear.</p>
<p>A big shot? He&#x27;s nobody. Shin Yuan gritted his teeth. His indignant expression making him look like a true movie star. There&#x27;s this guy in the company. He&#x27;s the real chosen one.</p>
<p>Damn, that guy&#x27;s life is more comfortable than any emperor in ancient times. He seemed to have found an outlet, pointing at the ceiling and cursing loudly. We&#x27;re all being trained like dogs by those instructors on the training field every day, working ourselves to the bone just to improve our skills a little bit. and him. He just stays in the company&#x27;s top level security fortress every day and doesn&#x27;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan grew angrier as he spoke, pointing to his own nose with a face full of grief and indignation. Why should I? Because of his worthless talent. I painstakingly broke through to the second realm. In terms of combat power, I could easily crush him. But what about those company bosses? They gave all their resources and the best medicine to that guy.</p>
<p>We are risking our lives while he is enjoying himself. A heartfelt accusation, every word like a heavy hammer, struck Natasha&#x27;s heart. Shin Yuan&#x27;s description perfectly matched the targets characteristics. Looking at Shin Yuan in front of him, he is a second realm martial artist at a young age, drives a company exclusive shadow beetle, and possesses a dragon card. His talent is definitely not low.</p>
<p>As someone in the industry who knows some of the inside information, his words are highly credible. Found it. You search high and low without finding it only to have it come to you effortlessly. Natasha suppressed her overwhelming joy and looked at the spoiled brat in front of her whose face was contorted with jealousy. Her azure eyes gleamed with a determined light.</p>
<p>Natasha made a decision instantly. Shin yuan standing before her was the only stepping stone for her to reach her true goal. We must use our beauty to completely bewitch him and make him willingly become our intelligence source. A resolute glint flashed in her eyes. She pressed herself against Shun Yuan again, her body limp as if boneless, and soothe him with a tender tone.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, don&#x27;t be angry anymore. Talk to your sister and she&#x27;ll help you get revenge. Shinyuan glanced at her sideways, his eyes somewhat glazed over as if he had drunk too much. You? He scoffed, his voice full of contempt. What can you do to help me? Taking advantage of the situation, he casually asked, &quot;How did you, a foreigner, end up opening a bar in Dongghai, &quot;And you&#x27;re doing so well?&quot; Natasha&#x27;s body trembled slightly, and her azure eyes misted it over, revealing endless sorrow and vulnerability.</p>
<p>&quot;I,&quot; she lowered her head, her voice choked with emotion, and began to tell a story she had prepared long ago. &quot;I am actually the daughter of a fallen noble family in the Western Federation. My family fell on hard times and I was sold like a commodity to a powerful old man in the EC. That old man, very old, who had never had a wife or children, was attracted to my exotic looks. He locked me on the top floor of this bar, refusing to let me see anyone, treating me like his possession.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan listened with great interest and even offered a serious comment. An old cow eating young grass. Is the old man&#x27;s body up to it? Natasha was momentarily speechless at his jarring remark, but she continued acting anyway, tears welling up and sliding down her cheeks, making her look even more pitiful. He was willing but unable. That night, he drank a lot of medicinal wine to enhance the mood.</p>
<p>But before he could, she bit her lip, looking ashamed to speak. Haven&#x27;t you had time to do anything yet? Shinuan pressed. He died from sudden heart failure. Cough, cough, cough. Shinuan couldn&#x27;t hold back and spat out the mouthful of blood he had just drunk.</p>
<p>Luckily, he reacted quickly and turned his head away. Otherwise, it would have sprayed all over the face of this ace spy. Goodness, this plot is more exciting than a melodramatic soap opera. Keep writing. Keep writing.</p>
<p>This script wouldn&#x27;t have attracted any investment in my past life. He quickly took another gulp of wine, coughed violently a few times to cover his laughter, turned his head and put on a sympathetic look, and hugged Natasha even tighter. &quot;Sorry, the liquor was too strong. I choked. That&#x27;s so unfortunate of you.</p>
<p>What happened next?&quot; &quot;Later,&quot; Natasha nestled in his arms, her body trembling slightly with shame and sorrow, her voice soft and low. He had no heirs, so all his property, including this bar, naturally went into my name. Thus, I went from being a prisoner to becoming the owner of this place. A tragic, bizarre, yet logically consistent story. This explained her origins and gave her a perfect cover for her identity.</p>
<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the system, Shin Yuan would almost have believed it. Okay, stop crying. Shin Yuan roughly wiped away her tears with his fingers, but he didn&#x27;t control his strength well and left a black tear stain on her delicate face. Her makeup was ruined. He pinched her chin, forcing her to look up into those tearary blue eyes and grinned.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s just an old man. What&#x27;s there to cry about? The atmosphere instantly became ambiguous and intense. Natasha has achieved her goal. She has successfully obtained crucial intelligence and gained the initial trust of her target. Next, it&#x27;s time to close the net.</p>
<p>The last vestage of rationality that belonged to a spy in her eyes was covered by a thick layer of seductive charm. Little brother, let&#x27;s not talk about those unhappy things. she murmured softly in the most seductive husky voice. &quot;Let your older sister take good care of you tonight.&quot; Before she finished speaking, her sexy red lips pressed against Shun Yuans lips. Cool, soft, with the aroma of blood rum.</p>
<p>A glint of light flashed in Shun Yuan&#x27;s eyes. They instantly turned the tables. Chapter 27. Natasha endures humiliation. Inside the starry sky palace, Natasha&#x27;s eyelashes trembled slightly, and it took her a long time to open her bright blue eyes.</p>
<p>On the other side, the man had already stood up. Tsk tsk, &quot;You&#x27;re awake?&quot; Shin yuan bent down, stretched out two fingers, and pinched Natasha&#x27;s delicate face like he was teasing a kitten. It felt smooth to the touch. I have to say, the women of the Western Federation are truly something else. Natasha&#x27;s body stiffened abruptly, a wave of humiliation washing over her.</p>
<p>I wanted to hide, but I was too weak to move. Fortunately, the person who bought you was an old man who was willing but unable to do so. Otherwise, it would have been a real waste of your health. Shin Yuan&#x27;s fingertips traced the bridge of her high nose. Then he leaned close to her ear, his voice full of teasing laughter.</p>
<p>How was it? My first experience. What does it mean to be a real man? instead of being with an old man. Natasha bit her full lips so hard they almost bled. She suppressed her anger and humiliation, squeezing out a few horse syllables from her throat. You are very manly, huh? You only just realized that? Shinyuan burst out laughing, straightened up, and began to slowly put on his clothes.</p>
<p>Under Natasha&#x27;s almost fiery gaze, he slowly walked to the door and placed his hand on the doororknob. He suddenly turned around, a wicked smile on his face. By the way, I&#x27;ll bring a few of my buddies over to this bar in a few days to patronize your business. Natasha&#x27;s pupils suddenly contracted. If you prepare a few more sisters who are good at taking care of people, you&#x27;ll definitely reap the benefits.</p>
<p>After saying that, Shinuan opened the door without looking back, whistling as he stroed away. Bang. The moment the door closed, Natasha could no longer contain herself and grabbed a pillow, slamming it hard against the door. She struggled to sit up. Last night&#x27;s events are replaying in my mind like a nightmare.</p>
<p>Her supposedly irresistible charm had lost its effectiveness. Utter disgrace. However, after the overwhelming anger and humiliation subsided slightly, Shin Yuan&#x27;s last words rekindled the flame of espionage in her eyes. Lur a snake out of its hole. Isn&#x27;t this exactly what I wanted? A hint of ruthlessness flashed across her face as she struggled to get out of bed and retrieved a miniature communicator from a very well-hidden compartment.</p>
<p>Headquarters. I am Black Widow. I have successfully infiltrated a key insider within the protective umbrella company. This person holds a high position, but is extremely leerous and greedy. I can use this person to lure out more high-v value targets, requesting additional manpower.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to her, her self-proclaimed report, which she believed to be in complete control of the situation, was gradually dragging her and the organization behind her into a well-laid trap. the headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation with its exclusive underground passageway. The black shadow beetle slid in silently and came to a steady stop. Shinuan got out of the car humming a little tune, feeling so happy he could fly. Looking up, I saw the figure standing in front of me with his arms crossed in a blank expression.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Li Yun, Sister Lii. Just as Shin Yuan was about to speak, Lun walked straight over without saying a word. She took out a small silver device from her pocket and began to scan Shinuan carefully from head to toe. Drop. The instrument emits a crisp green light indicating that everything is normal.</p>
<p>Shinyuan breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that nothing strange had been hidden on him, but Lein still seemed uneasy, and after putting away the instrument, she actually started using it. Her well-maintained, slender hands groped and padded all over Shun Yuan&#x27;s body, especially in extremely hidden places such as his collar, cuffs, and belt buckle, touching and examining them with exceptional care. Shin Yuan felt uncomfortable being touched by her and couldn&#x27;t help but tease her. Sisterly, please don&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in public and it&#x27;s not a good look. He lowered his voice and said with a wicked smile, I&#x27;m a married man. If Uncle Xiao sees me like this, he&#x27;ll definitely come after me to the death. After Lein finished her inspection and confirmed that there were no eavesdropping or tracking devices on him, she slowly raised her head. There was no smile on her face.</p>
<p>Instead, a playful sneer curled at the corner of her mouth. Do you have a wife? Last night, your new wife really charmed you. She called you all sorts of things. Lie Yun perfectly imitated the exclamations Natasha and Shin Yuan made last night and then slowly added a sentence while looking at Shin Yuan. Do you need me to play back the entire recording for you? Boom! Shiny Yuan felt as if he had been struck on the top of his head by a bolt of divine lightning.</p>
<p>And he was instantly petrified. His smuggness and smile froze instantly. His eyes widened like saucers, and he stammered. &quot;You were eavesdropping. What does it mean to eavesdrop?&quot; Lean rolled her eyes at him and put her hands on her hips with an air of self-righteousness.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s for your safety. You&#x27;re dealing with the Federation&#x27;s top spy. What if they drug you or kidnap you? Constant monitoring is a necessary security measure. After saying that, she seemed to feel it wasn&#x27;t enough and added another sentence that sent chills down Shin Yuans spine. Don&#x27;t worry, there are no visuals, only audio.</p>
<p>But your perseverance is truly impressive. Even Xiao Jingua would have to admit defeat. Shin Yuan froze on the spot. His voice trembled as he asked with his last glimmer of hope. Sisterly, besides you, no one else listened last night, right? Of course.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans heart sank to the bottom and a terrible thought surfaced in his mind. Could it be that person? It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s over. The glorious and towering image I had in old Master Chin&#x27;s eyes has completely collapsed. What are you thinking? Leun was amused by his expression of utter despair.</p>
<p>He had no time to eaves drop on her. She leaned close to Shun Yuans ear and in a gloating tone revealed the final answer. Besides me, the other two listeners were Su Ching Zhu and Longing. Shin Yuans expression instantly changed from despair to terror. What did Dr.</p>
<p>Sue say? Her Li Yun recalled the scene from last night, her smile widening. She analyzed your data throughout, saying things like, &quot;Your adrenaline levels were three times the normal peak and your dopamine levels remain high, proving that you were extremely satisfied with this test subject.&quot; She also suggested that I not close the net for now, but instead capture the female spy so that she could collect gene interaction data in the long term. Shinuan, this research goddess&#x27;s thought process is truly beyond the comprehension of normal people. And what about instructor Long? Shin Yuan asked this question, already sensing something was wrong. Longing Leons smile faded slightly.</p>
<p>She looked Shun Yuan up and down, her eyes filled with pity. She didn&#x27;t say a word last night, just kept a cold face. Now Li Yun patted Shin Yuan on the shoulder, her tone becoming meaningful. She&#x27;s waiting for you in the training room. She said that given what you did last night, today&#x27;s daily training, all items, triple it again.</p>
<p>Chapter 28, textbook style teasing, the devil&#x27;s smile. Shin Yuan hummed a little tune, feeling so happy he could fly and strode towards Su Ching Xus private laboratory. He had already planned that when he met Dr. Su, he would first take credit for her work and then take the opportunity to apply for some research funding as a reward. Pushing open the futuristic alloy door of the laboratory, a familiar cool fragrance wafted out.</p>
<p>Such was standing in front of the huge light screen, wearing a well-tailored white coat and her signature gold rim glasses perched on her nose. She turned around slowly when she heard the noise, her eyes behind her glasses calm and still. They&#x27;ve arrived. Good morning, Dr. Sue.</p>
<p>Was last night&#x27;s performance exciting? With acting skills like mine, winning an Oscar wouldn&#x27;t be an exaggeration, would it? Shin Yuan grinned and leaned closer, looking like he was waiting to be praised. Su Ching Xu didn&#x27;t respond to him. Instead, she pushed up her glasses and in a cold tone as if reading an experimental report, slowly recited a series of data that made his scalp tingle. Last night, it started at 117 a.m. and ended at 6:03 a.m., lasting a total of 4 hours and 46 minutes.</p>
<p>During this period, your heart rate peaked at 180 beats per minute, lasting for 58 minutes. Adrenaline levels were three times the normal peak, and dopamine levels remained consistently high. She paused, her gaze shifting from the data curves on the screen to Shun Yuan&#x27;s increasingly stiff face. Conclusion: You showed extremely high satisfaction with the experimental subject designated Black Widow. Shinyuan smile froze.</p>
<p>It felt like I hadn&#x27;t just returned from a life of pleasure, but rather had just stepped off the operating table, stripped naked, and thoroughly analyzed from head to toe. This is even worse than Lie Yuns live audio broadcast. Such Ching Xu seemed to enjoy his discomforted expression. She walked over with elegant steps, the sound of her red high heels clicking on the ground, feeling like each step was on Shin Yuans heart. Given your strong reaction to the test subject, I have submitted an application to the company&#x27;s upper management.</p>
<p>She stopped in front of Shun Yuan, a slight smile curving her lips. Imagine Black Widow as your personal stress tester, permanently stationed next door, allowing us to collect valuable data on inter species gene interactions 24/7. What do you think of this suggestion? Shin Yuan&#x27;s face instantly turned from white to red and then from red to green. A dedicated pressure testing device living next door to a female spy everyday. Is this woman a devil? However, the expected outburst of anger did not occur.</p>
<p>After the initial embarrassment and shock, Shin Yuan calmed down. Looking at this scientific beauty in front of him, who was speaking frivolously with a straight face. A surge of lust suddenly rose within him. The next second, he suddenly took a step forward. Su Ching Xus vision blurred, and her back slammed heavily against the cold alloy wall.</p>
<p>Shinuan braced his arms on either side of her body, trapping her between himself and the wall. a standard wall slam. The distance between the two instantly shrank to the point where they could hear each other&#x27;s breaths. Shinyuan lowered his head, his nose almost touching her hair. He took a deep breath, a look of utter ecstasy on his face.</p>
<p>Dr. Su, you smell so good. Shin Yuans eyes, burning with fire, stared straight at her. Are you jealous? This sudden counterattack stunned Su Chingu. Shinyuan gave her no chance to react and continued to push his luck, his voice low and horsearo.</p>
<p>Compared to those cookie cutter exotic styles, I still prefer your intellectual, mature, and wickedly roguish domestic top-of-the-line style. He extended a finger, gently plucked a strand of her hair, and placed it near his lips. So, instead of going to great lengths to find me some testing equipment, his gaze slowly moved down, landing on the curves that even the white coat couldn&#x27;t hide, and his smile became increasingly sinister. Why don&#x27;t you come and test it for me yourself tonight? Isn&#x27;t it more scientific and rigorous to have my body data created and personally verified by you? This blatant provocation made the air in the laboratory feel hot and bothersome. Suing Xus unchanging professional mask finally showed a tiny crack.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t panic, nor did she push him away. Instead, she stretched out her slender hand clad in a white glove and gently touched Shun Yuans firm chest, her fingertips touching through a thin layer of clothing as if testing the strength of his muscles. my test. She met Shin Yuans aggressive gaze, her eyes behind her glasses revealing no emotion. You can&#x27;t afford it.</p>
<p>She tightened her fingertips slightly, then said, &quot;For example, I could apply to the company&#x27;s upper management to modify the trigger conditions for your F-level talent. Upgrade the daily 100 push-ups to 1,000 squats with a 500 kg weight. Upgrade the 10 km run to 100 km cross country run under 10 times gravity.&quot; What do you think? The cold words were like a bucket of cold water trying to extinguish Shun Yuans arrogance. However, Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t back down and grabbed her mischievous hand. He brought that gloved slender hand to his lips and gently placed a kiss on it through a thin layer of latex.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xus body stiffened almost imperceptibly, and her breath paused for half a second. Carrying a load, Shin Yuan raised his eyes and looked at her with a mischievous smile. I&#x27;m a picky person. Rather than a cold, hard block of iron, I prefer someone who can accompany me and train with me. With you by my side, that&#x27;s enough.</p>
<p>With his other hand, he boldly wrapped his arm around Su Ching Xus slender waist, pulling her even closer into his embrace. Chapter 29. Jealousy overturned. The goddess&#x27;s double pampering. Boom! Such brain completely shut down in that instant.</p>
<p>She could feel a scorching heat rushing from her ears to the top of her head. And for the first time, two blushes appeared on her face, which was always adorned with rationality and confidence. How dare he? She tried to pull her hand away and retreat, only to find herself firmly held in a pair of iron-like arms. The solid chest was like a wall, making it impossible for her to move. Open.</p>
<p>Her voice no longer carried the coldness of a scientist, but instead carried a hint of feminine embarrassment and annoyance. I won&#x27;t let go. Shin Yuan smiled like a triumphant rogue. and he even lowered his head to rub his nose against her hair. Unless Dr.</p>
<p>Su agrees to come and test me personally tonight. You&#x27;re dreaming. Su Ching Xu gritted her teeth, realizing that her composure and rationality were crumbling little by little under the man&#x27;s repeated provocations. Conventional threats have no effect on him since the soft approach didn&#x27;t work. Such took a deep breath, a resolute glint flashing in her watery eyes.</p>
<p>She suddenly stopped struggling. Her whole body went limp and instead revealed a gentle smile. Oh, really? She slowly and deliberately took out a miniature projector about the size of a matchbox from the pocket of her white coat. Shinuan, since you are so dedicated to scientific research, I happen to have a new research project that I haven&#x27;t been able to find suitable live subjects for clinical trials. She pointed the projector at the alloy wall next to her.</p>
<p>A flash of light revealed the title of a document. Clearly 100% pure ancient dragon descendant subspecies spinal fluid injection clinical trial protocol. Alternative name dragon blood number three original solution. Suching voice returned to its icy emotionless tone. Each word like an icicle piercing Shun Yuan&#x27;s ears.</p>
<p>The dragon blood number two you received before was only a 50% diluted solution. This one, however, is a 100% pure solution without any treatment. She turned to Shin Yuan and gave him a smile that was both sweet and cruel. Since you have so much energy, why not dedicate your precious body to the company&#x27;s great genetic science right now? Don&#x27;t worry. According to my simulations, the mortality rate throughout the entire process is She paused deliberately, then extended a slender gloved finger and gently touched Shun Yuans lips.</p>
<p>The gesture was suggestive, but her eyes were icy cold, only 99.9%. Shinyuan&#x27;s smile immediately froze. Staring at that ominous headline, &quot;The fear of being dominated by dragon blood, too. The excruciating pain of being unable to live or die seemed to be replaying itself in every cell of my body.&quot; The 50% dilution almost killed him. 100% pure solution.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not even human anymore. That&#x27;s just being reincarnated. He swallowed hard, his face turning as white as a wall. The arrogant and doineering wolf from a moment ago instantly turned into a trembling little white pig. He swiftly released his grip on Su Ching Xu, took three steps back, then snapped to attention, raised his hands, and assumed a standard surrender posture.</p>
<p>His handsome face immediately revealed righteous indignation and passionate fervor. I was wrong, Dr. Sue. I have come to realize that I am someone who has transcended base desires. I am a model young person who loves training, yearns to become stronger, and excels in all five aspects.</p>
<p>Instructor Long is still waiting for me in the training room. I can&#x27;t let personal feelings make me late for training. Before he finished speaking, he quickly turned around and with an explosive force completely out of character for his current physical abilities, transformed into a blur, and rushed toward the laboratory door. Bang! The alloy door was slammed shut. Silence returned to the laboratory.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu remained in the position of her fingertip touching his lips, leaning against the cold wall, staring at the tightly closed door, stunned for a full 3 seconds. Immediately, she could no longer restrain herself and covered her mouth with her hand. A clear, crisp laugh like a secluded orchid blooming quietly in a secluded valley. She slid to the ground, laughing so hard her shoulders shook and tears streamed down her face. That facade of intellect, abstinence, and coldness shattered at that moment, transforming into a captivating and uniquely feminine charm that stirs the soul.</p>
<p>Shinyuan ran all the way until he reached the floor where the training room was located, then stopped with lingering fear. He leaned against the wall, panting heavily, his heart still pounding. That&#x27;s terrifying. That woman is an absolute devil. I can&#x27;t afford to mess with her.</p>
<p>After calming down, he stood at the door of the training room and his mood instantly became complicated again. Having just escaped the clutches of a mad scientist, they are now about to enter the den of devilish instructors. The thought that Longing had also listened to the entire live broadcast last night sent chills down Shin Yuan&#x27;s spine. Given that I see instructors temper, today&#x27;s training will probably be. But for some reason, deep in his heart, besides fear, there was also a secret expectation.</p>
<p>He straightened his somewhat disheveled clothes and then pushed open the door to the training room. The huge training ground was completely empty. Only one figure stood quietly in the very center of the venue with his back to him. It&#x27;s longing. But she&#x27;s a little different today.</p>
<p>Instead of wearing the loose training clothes, she changed into a set of all black tight fitting combat gear. The clothes seemed like a second skin to her, perfectly outlining her flawless figure which was free of any excess fat and full of strength and athleticism. Hearing the door open, she didn&#x27;t turn around immediately, but spoke coldly in a voice devoid of any warmth. If you&#x27;re 3 minutes late, your training load will be doubled. Shin Yuans heart skipped a beat, and he was about to explain that he had been delayed by Dr.</p>
<p>Su. Longing had already turned around. Her stunningly beautiful face was expressionless, and her sharp phoenix eyes were colder than ever before. She glanced at Shun Yuan from head to toe, her gaze lingering for a second on his slightly disheveled collar, a faint yet dangerous smile playing on her lips. Did you have a great time last night? Oh no, she really did hear it.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Shin Yuans reply, she stroed towards him step by step. His tall figure cast an invisible pressure over Shin Yuan. Today, I will let you. She stopped in front of Shan Yuan, slightly tilted her flawless face up, and said with utmost seriousness, to enjoy it even more. Shin Yuan felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.</p>
<p>Long Yings icy gaze and her meaningful words, &quot;Enjoy it even more,&quot; made his heart pound uncontrollably. &quot;It&#x27;s over. This woman is definitely jealous, and she&#x27;s the kind of woman who would blow up a vinegar factory. Today&#x27;s training is going to be brutally tortured by her.&quot; Chapter 30 is finished. Su Ching Xu discovered my special XP.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, &quot;Things aren&#x27;t what you think. I can explain.&quot; Shin Yuan forced a smile that looked more like a grimace, attempting a final struggle. &quot;Shut up!&quot; Longing uttered two words, her voice not loud, but they hit Shin Yuans face like ice shards, she raised her chin and pointed to the ground. &quot;500 push-ups begin now. 500.&quot; Shin Yuan almost couldn&#x27;t catch his breath.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a hundred of them almost killed him. And today, it&#x27;s five times that. This isn&#x27;t just doubling the training volume. It&#x27;s practically trying to kill him on the spot. What? You can&#x27;t do it.</p>
<p>Longing raised an eyebrow, her contempt undisguised. Who says I can&#x27;t do it? Shin Yuan was provoked by her gaze, and the stubbornness in his bones also came to the four. It&#x27;s just 500 push-ups. I am now a second realm martial artist, and my physical abilities are vastly different from what they used to be. He gritted his teeth, lay down on the ground without saying a word, and braced himself with his hands.</p>
<p>Looking at his defiant demeanor, Ly Yings lips curled into an even colder expression. She walked slowly to Shun Yuan&#x27;s side, and under his gaze, which was both nervous and filled with a strange expectation, she slowly untied the shoelaces of her military boots and took them off. A pair of slender ankles and two white jade feet reappeared before his eyes. the familiar recipe. The idea of a welfare bureau had just popped into Shin Yuans mind.</p>
<p>The next second, he realized how terribly wrong he had been. One, Shin Yuan exerted force with both arms and gritted his teeth to complete the first one. The weight on my back was about the same as yesterday, and it even felt a bit lighter because of my improved strength. He had just breathed a sigh of relief, preparing to face this sweet torment. But when he got to the 10th one, something went wrong.</p>
<p>The weight on my back suddenly increased. It was no longer the weight of a woman. A cold, heavy force pressed down on his back through that foot like a small mountain that was constantly growing heavier. Shin Yuan&#x27;s face instantly turned bright red, and the veins on his arms bulged out. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of wisps of faint white energy swirling around Long Yings jade-like feet.</p>
<p>Good heavens. This woman actually used her vital energy to add weight to herself. That&#x27;s so insidious. Is that all the strength you&#x27;ve lost? A cold voice came from above, carrying undisguised sarcasm. Did you use all your energy on that foreign woman last night? Can&#x27;t even last this much.</p>
<p>Every word was like a poison nail driven deep into Shu Yuans pride. She emphasized the words foreign woman. Especially Shin Yuan&#x27;s face instantly turned from red to liver red humiliation. This is a blatant insult. He gritted his teeth, let out a suppressed growl, and unleashed unprecedented power in his arms, managing to support more than a dozen more.</p>
<p>Sweat dripped from his forehead and nose, quickly soaking the mat beneath him. Longing looked at his desperate appearance, but the coldness in her eyes did not melt away in the slightest. If I don&#x27;t finish 500, I will stop stepping on your back starting tomorrow. Shinyuan felt relieved upon hearing this. It&#x27;s better not to step on it.</p>
<p>If she stomps on it again, I&#x27;ll be crushed into a meat patty. However, Lyings next words chilled him to the bone. I will wear military boots and step on you one foot at a time until you finish. Boom. An incredibly absurd image flashed through Shun Yuans mind in an instant.</p>
<p>Long Yings long legs encased in black military boots, her heroic face, and those military boots covered in the dust of the training ground. What? I don&#x27;t have any weird fetishes, do I? Just as Shin Yuan was stunned by his sudden thought, Su Ching Xus calm and emotionless analytical voice suddenly came over the loudspeaker in the training room. Real-time physiological data monitoring. Heart rate increases by 15% instantly and adrenaline secretion shows an abnormal peak. Preliminary assessment suggests that the experimental subjects exhibited a strong potential for excitement in response to this behavior.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, your threat seems to have a reverse motivational effect. It is recommended to increase the intensity of the stimulus in order to obtain more complete experimental data. Quiet, a deathly silence. Shin Yuan stood frozen in place, wishing he could disappear into a crack in the ground right then and there. Social death.</p>
<p>This is worse than being shot in public. Lyings icy pretty face turned ashen instantly because of Su Ching Xus scientific remark. She looked down at the man beneath her who seemed to want to bury his face in the ground. her Phoenix eyes flashing with intense contempt and disgust. You damn bastard.</p>
<p>Not only is he leerous, but he also has this kind of perverted fetish. Overwhelmed with shame and indignation, she suddenly increased the force of her energy under her feet. Adash Shin Yuan felt as if his spine was about to be broken and his anger and shame erupted from the bottom of his heart. He couldn&#x27;t let his little quirk be confirmed. He wants to prove himself.</p>
<p>Roar. Shin Yuan let out a beast-like roar. His eyes bloodshot, completely reckless. The wisps of vital energy within his body circulated wildly, and the strength in his arms broke through its limits at this moment. 100 200 300.</p>
<p>He was doing push-ups frantically in a way that was almost self-destructive, so fast that even Longing was a little surprised. When he finished the 500th push-up, Shinuan&#x27;s arms went limp and he collapsed to the ground like a rag doll, unable to move even a finger. looking at the man on the ground, soaked in sweat and lying like a dead dog. Ly Yings anger inexplicably dissipated by more than half. Shinyuan is a rogue and a pervert, but his ruthlessness and willpower are definitely not those of a fool.</p>
<p>She looked at him quietly, her eyes filled with complex emotions. The training room&#x27;s loudspeaker blared again, this time with Su Ching Xus voice carrying a hint of a smile. Data recorded. Shinuan, congratulations on unlocking a new XP hobby. Shiny Yuan.</p>
<p>Chapter 31. For the sake of the beautiful instructor, please look at me with your cannon. Next. 1,000 sit-ups. The icy voice sent Shun Yuan, who had just caught his breath, crashing back into hell.</p>
<p>A thousand. This woman wants him dead, right? Absolutely. Shin Yuan was on the verge of tears and struggled to turn over and lie on the mat. He had just adjusted his posture when Longing stepped over. Shin Yuans heart skipped a beat, and he was already prepared for her to step on his calf again.</p>
<p>However, Lyings actions this time exceeded his expectations. Under Shin Yuans horrified gaze, Shin Yuan felt as if his internal organs had all gone out of place. She actually used herself as a stool. Begin. Ly Yings voice was devoid of any emotion.</p>
<p>Shinuan, he now seriously suspects that this woman is using training as a pretext to settle personal scores. Shin Yuan gritted his teeth and used his abdominal muscles to lift his upper body with difficulty. His nostrils were filled with her unique scent, a mixture of sweat and cool fragrance, making him dizzy. The final squat took the torture to a whole new level. Shin Yuan felt as if he was carrying not a person, but a breathing mountain.</p>
<p>With each squat, my knees groaned in agony, as if they were being thrown into a fire and burned. L Yings breath was right next to his ear, the warm air blowing against his earlobe, making him uneasy. Several times, he almost knelt down because his legs were too weak. As the last squat was completed, Shin Yuan&#x27;s vision went black and his consciousness sank completely into darkness. I don&#x27;t know how much time passed.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan slowly opened his eyes amidst the stimulating sensation of alternating ice and fire. He found himself soaking in the familiar alloy bathtub in the laboratory next door. This time, however, the liquid in the bathtub was no longer dark green, but a strange crimson red like flowing magma radiating a chilling heat. Woke up. Such voice rang out from the side.</p>
<p>She was holding a device, her eyes behind the lenses gleaming with excitement as she rapidly recorded his various physical data. How are you feeling? This is a 60% concentration of dragon blood number four that I formulated based on your latest physical data. Such pushed up her glasses, pointed at the data curves on the screen that were soaring wildly, and spoke with fervor. Are you ready for a new round of evolution? Shin yuan soaked in the medicinal liquid that emitted terrifying heat and let out a comfortable sigh. The fatigue in my body is being rapidly dispelled, and a surge of power, even more ferocious than before, is courarssing through my limbs and bones.</p>
<p>When I close my eyes, Natasha&#x27;s alluring and fiery figure involuntarily appears in my mind.&quot; He grinned. &quot;In the current situation, if that female spy dares to come again, he is confident that he can show her what a real company Iron Cavalry is. Stop daydreaming.&quot; A cold voice interrupted his revery. Longing entered the bathtub at some point, kicking the edge of the tub with her toe, her eyes still unfriendly. Shinyuan opened his eyes, just about to retort.</p>
<p>But then, Su Chingu walked to the bathtub with a brand new metal briefcase in her hand. With a click, the box opened. Inside were no longer test tubes, but rows of syringes gleaming with metallic sheen, each filled with a different colored liquid that flashed dangerously under the light. Given that the absorption efficiency of oral and medicated baths has reached a bottleneck, Such Ching Zhu picked up a syringe filled with a dark blue liquid and gave Shinuan a smile that sent chills down his spine. Starting today, we&#x27;ll switch to a more direct and efficient approach.</p>
<p>She shook the syringe in her hand. It was thicker than Shin Yuan&#x27;s thumb. Direct introvenous injection. Introvenous injection. Shin Yuan looked at the thick syringe and the ominous blue liquid inside and felt his hair stand on end.</p>
<p>What a joke. He almost died from just taking a bath. If that were injected directly into a blood vessel, wouldn&#x27;t the person die on the spot? Dr. Su, I think medicinal baths are quite good. They&#x27;re gradual and in line with the scientific development concept.</p>
<p>Shinuan tried to reason with him. No. Su Chingu flatly refused. She pushed up her gold rimmed glasses and said in an unquestionable professional tone, &quot;Your body has developed resistance to dragon blood number four, and the absorption rate of the medicinal bath has decreased by 12%. If you want to break through to the third realm in the shortest time, intravenous injection is the only optimal solution.&quot; She picked up the syringe and looked at it under the light.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, this is dragon blood number five. I have diluted the concentration to 5%, so theoretically, your body can handle it. In theory, it&#x27;s that damn theory again. Shinuan&#x27;s blood pressure spiked the moment he heard those three words. He hurriedly turned his pleading gaze to Longing beside him, hoping that this aloof instructor would have a change of heart and say something fair.</p>
<p>However, Longing only glanced at him coldly, as if she were looking at an idiot. Without a word, she definitely removed her black combat jacket, revealing a black sports bra that perfectly accentuated her powerful physique and strode straight into the crimson liquid. Water splashed up, but she didn&#x27;t even flinch. She demonstrated her stance through her actions. Shinyuan&#x27;s heart sank instantly.</p>
<p>Oh no, these two women are teaming up to kill me today. Just when he was feeling utterly hopeless, he heard Su Ching Xus teasing voice again. Shinuan, you still don&#x27;t understand women. She&#x27;s a fourth realm Grand Marshall master and you&#x27;re a second realm martial artist. If she doesn&#x27;t want to, how could you possibly touch a single hair on her head? She&#x27;s afraid you&#x27;ll die inside, but she&#x27;s too ashamed to say it outright.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s saying one thing and meaning another, you know. Suching voice wasn&#x27;t loud, but it carried clearly throughout the entire laboratory. L Yings icy, pretty face flushed red from her ears to her neck in an instant. She glared fiercely in the direction of the observation room, biting her lower lip tightly, but couldn&#x27;t utter a single word in rebuttal. Shin Yuan felt a sudden tremor in his heart when he saw her expression of mixed shame and indignation, yet also one of tacid agreement.</p>
<p>A warm current filled with anticipation instantly washed away all fear and resistance, flowing through my entire body. It turns out that this iceberg isn&#x27;t really that cold. She still has her own thoughts in her heart. This discovery instantly dispelled the last bit of fear in Shun Yuans heart and boundless fighting spirit and pride surged forth. It&#x27;s just a shot, isn&#x27;t it? With a beautiful female instructor protecting me, even dying would be worth it.</p>
<p>Dr. Su, stop doawling. Shun Yuan voluntarily extended his arm, his face displaying a tragic resolve as if he were facing certain death. Come on, even if the king of heaven himself came today, I&#x27;d still take the shot. Fire at me.</p>
<p>Chapter 32. Military flower long Yings jade feed attack. Something&#x27;s going on. With a smile, Su Chingu precisely inserted the cold needle into Shun Yuan&#x27;s vein. A tube of dark blue liquid was pushed in.</p>
<p>His dash. The previous medicinal baths caused physical suffering. But this time, every cell in the body was being ignited and torn apart from the inside. The excruciating pain instantly overwhelmed his reason. Everything went black, and he couldn&#x27;t even let out a scream.</p>
<p>His consciousness felt as if an invisible hand was gripping it, trying to tear his soul out of his body. His body convulsed violently in the scalding liquid, and even beads of blood seeped from his skin, making the crimson liquid appear even darker. Just as his consciousness was about to be completely torn apart by this devastating pain, a pair of cold yet powerful hands pressed heavily against his back. A stream of extremely pure internal energy forcefully entered his chaotic and violent body, acting like a solid dam to protect the last bit of clarity in his mind. Keep your mind focused.</p>
<p>Long Yings cold yet anxious voice boomed in his ears. If you dare to die here, I&#x27;ll pull you out and stomp on you a few times. This doineering threat of death acted like a powerful stimulant, jolting Shun Yuan awake. Die? Are you kidding me? I haven&#x27;t even knocked down those two mountains. Instructor Long and Dr.</p>
<p>Su. Yet, how could you die? Roar. Shin Yuan unleashed an earthshattering willpower. His eyes were bloodshot as he frantically guided the destructive medicinal power within his body, which was about to burst him apart and rammed it against the invisible barrier leading to the third realm time and time again. Collide.</p>
<p>Crash it again. His own meridians were breaking inch by inch. But under the protection of Long Yings internal energy, they were rebuilding inch by inch. Every breakage and rebuilding was accompanied by excruciating pain, but it also brought him one step closer to that barrier. I don&#x27;t know how much time passed.</p>
<p>It may be as long as a century. A muffled boom came from inside his body, and the seemingly indestructible barrier finally showed a crack. Then the cracks grew larger and larger, shattered with a deafening roar. All the violent medicinal power seemed to have found its final destination, surging wildly into the depths of the dantion, where it was compressed, condensed, and transformed. The originally thin, milky white primordial energy seemed to undergo a qualitative change at this moment, becoming more solid, and pure.</p>
<p>The middle stage of the second realm warrior. Ding! YourQi and blood points have surpassed 3,000. Congratulations, host, on successfully advancing to the mid-stage of the second realm martial artist. Ding. Due to the host&#x27;s willpower far exceeding that of ordinary people, the enhancement effect of this training has been slightly amplified.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s done. Shinuan opened his eyes and two sharp glints flashed and disappeared. He felt that he could smash a second tier star beast with a single punch. Inside the observation room, Su Chingu stared at the data curve on the light screen, which was rising almost vertically, and her breathing quickened. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Absolutely unbelievable. Chi and blood value 3,000. Muscle strength, bone density, and nerve reaction speed all surpass A-level talents of the same realm. Combined with his unreasonable F-level talent, his physical potential and recovery ability are no less than those of S-level talents at the same level. Her gaze peers through the special glass, landing on Ling in the bathtub, and she said in astonishment, &quot;Instructor Long,&quot; his physical talent is almost catching up to yours.</p>
<p>Inside the bathtub, Longing felt the new life force emanating from Shun Yuans body. Looking at his profile, which had become even more resolute and handsome under the tempering of pain, a complex emotion flashed in her eyes. &quot;This man is growing at a frightening rate. From an ordinary person with no strength to a mid-stage second realm martial artist with S-level talent, it only took him less than half a month. This is beyond what genius can describe.</p>
<p>This is a monster. This is a demon. Ding. Target Lyings favorability increased by 2%. Current favorability 80%.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan heard the notification sound in his mind and his heart stirred. 80%. It seems that simply training and verbal teasing are starting to lose their effectiveness. To conquer this iceberg, we need to take drastic measures. An incredibly audacious, even suicidal idea began to grow wildly in his mind.</p>
<p>The medicinal bath is over. Shin Yuan stood up from the bathtub, deliberately pretending to be weak and out of control. After a breakthrough, he slipped and fell towards Longing. His hands traced two precise arcs in the air, heading straight for that familiar. His face still showed a panicked expression.</p>
<p>Oh no, I slipped again. Act. just keep acting. Just as his groping was about to succeed, a hint of mockery, as if he had already seen through everything, flashed in Long Yings cold phoenix eyes. With a slight sway of her body, she perfectly avoided Shun Yuan&#x27;s sneak attack from an incredible angle that completely defied the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan&#x27;s hands grasped at empty air. Due to the immense inertia, the person was irresistibly thrown forward, about to make intimate contact with the hard alloy bathtub and fall flat on their face. Just as he was about to hit the ground face down, a lightning fast whip kick accompanied by a sharp whooshing sound shot out from below. A foot as clear as jade and with lines as perfect as a work of art rapidly magnified in his field of vision. Then bang, a dull, loud bang.</p>
<p>That perfect foot was imprinted precisely on Shin Yuan&#x27;s face. A tremendous force struck him, and Shin Yuan felt as if his nose was about to break. He was kicked backward by the force, flying over the edge of the bathtub and landing on the cold floor like a tattered sack. His vision blurred, his mind went blank, his face burned with a faint, lingering fragrance. He shook his head and struggled to lift it.</p>
<p>Longing stood in the bathtub, looking down at him. Water droplets slid down her perfect abs, adding to her feminine sexiness. A cold smile, tinged with a hint of punitive pleasure, appeared on her perpetually icy face. &quot;Want to slip up again?&quot; Shin yuan covered his face, grimacing as he got up from the ground, gasping for breath as he shamelessly said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to slide anymore, instructor. I just wanted to test how much faster my reaction speed was after the breakthrough.</p>
<p>Your kick was very helpful.&quot; Ling was so angry at Shun Yuans shameless remarks that she choked and snorted coldly. Just then, Su Ching Xus calm analysis came over the loudspeaker again. Real-time data feedback, the subject&#x27;s face was subjected to a moderate blunt force trauma, but the level of dopamine secretion in the brain fluctuated abnormally with the peak value increasing by 3% compared to the previous backstepping incident. Conclusion: The potential excitation threshold of the experimental subjects is increasing. Instructor Long, your aggressive behavior may need further diversification to ensure the sustainability of the stimulus effect.</p>
<p>L Yings face darkened instantly. She glared at the observation room, gritting her teeth. Su Ching Xu, seeing that the iceberg was about to explode, Shinuan quickly tried to smooth things over. A him Dr. Su, don&#x27;t talk nonsense.</p>
<p>I was in pain. My brain was spinning from the pain. As he spoke, he quietly gave a thumbs up towards the observation room. Well done, Dr. pursue a divine assist.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu seemed not to hear Long Yings warning and continued in her flat tone. Received the subjects denial behavior has been recorded. According to the psychological model, this is a typical example of an attempt to cover up the truth. Experiment log updated. You Long Yings chest heaved violently.</p>
<p>Clearly, she was furious. She glared fiercely at Shun Yuan on the ground, her eyes seeming to say, &quot;I&#x27;ll remember this death.&quot; She ignored the two clowns, turned around, and stepped out of the bathtub, grabbed a towel to wrap herself in, and left the laboratory without looking back. Looking at her murderous back, Shinuan was not afraid at all. Instead, he chuckled. The favorability rating didn&#x27;t drop this time, which means there&#x27;s still hope.</p>
<p>Chapter 33. Icebreaking progress. 50% seeking comfort from Lynn Shuran. Half an hour later, with the clear five finger toe mark on his face, Shin Yuan returned to his presidential suite, feeling dejected. Damn it, we&#x27;ve lost a fortune.</p>
<p>Not only did the anticipated accidental reward not go through, but Longing, that woman, also kicked him in the face. The allure of that kick still makes him a little restless. But being publicly humiliated makes him feel like he&#x27;s suffered for nothing, and he&#x27;s feeling uneasy all over. Damn system. Didn&#x27;t you say the favorability rating had increased? Why is she kicking me so hard? Shinyuan mentally ranted and raved.</p>
<p>Ding. Special physical contact. Dragon born&#x27;s trample has been achieved. Dragon born&#x27;s conquest progress increased by plus 10%. Current progress 50%.</p>
<p>System notification. This target has an extremely arrogant personality. Conventional tactics are ineffective. Physical contact. And the higher the targets feelings of shame and indignation, the faster their affection level will increase.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stared blankly at the line of small gold text on the system panel. What is this even possible? The more they fight, the closer they become. Is this some kind of attempt to seduce an aloof, mature woman or to tame a wild Tyrannosaurus Rex? He touched the still stinging mark on his face, a smile that no one else could understand. It seems I&#x27;ll have to make these accidental slips of the hand even more often in the future. Push open the sweet door.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans anger and frustration vanished the moment he saw the figure in the living room. Lyn Sharon was wearing a loose off-white maternity dress sitting quietly on the sofa. Sunlight streamed through the floor to ceiling windows bathing her in a soft glow. She was smiling and talking to two young women in nurses uniforms. Her already exquisite face now radiating a maternal tenderness that made one&#x27;s heart flutter.</p>
<p>Shin yuan&#x27;s slight displeasure immediately turned into an impulse to pounce on his ill little wife, hug her tightly, and seek comfort. However, just as he took a step, his ears twitched slightly, and he clearly caught the two nurses hushed but excited conversation. Sister Chan, just tell us quietly what&#x27;s the background of this Mr. Shan? How come brother Xiao and Sister Lee care about him so much? and he even lives in the company&#x27;s highest standard suite. He&#x27;s so mysterious.</p>
<p>A roundfaced nurse&#x27;s eyes were full of gossip. Another nurse with an oval face lowered her voice and chimed in mysteriously. Yeah. Yeah. I heard from Chef Wong at the third canteen that he saw brother Xiao handing a cigarette to Mr.</p>
<p>Shan. We&#x27;re all guessing that he must be some big shot in the capital whose logistics were left behind, you know. Lynn Sharon blushed a little from their back and forth questioning and awkwardly waved her hand, saying softly. He really is just an ordinary person. Don&#x27;t make wild guesses.</p>
<p>Oh my god, how could that be? The round-faced nurse exclaimed in disbelief. Can an ordinary person get this kind of treatment? Sister Churan, please don&#x27;t hide it from us. We promise we will never tell anyone. Shin Yuan&#x27;s eyes immediately turned cold. Another spy.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like it. These two nurses didn&#x27;t exude any martial arts aura. The curiosity and gossip in their eyes were genuine and didn&#x27;t seem faint. But their curiosity had already touched a nerve with him. His women are not people that just any Tom, Dick, or Harry can spy on or exploit.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan strode over, his fierce aura still not fully subdued after the hellish training and medicinal bath emanating from him without any attempt to conceal it. What are you talking about? That makes you so happy. The two were startled by his sudden aura, nearly dropping their water glasses. They jumped up from the sofa, their faces pale as they stared at him. Lynn Sharon was also startled.</p>
<p>She had never seen Shin Yuan so cold and serious. She stood up timidly and tugged at his sleeve. Shinuan, they are. Shiny Yuan patted her small hand to reassure her, but his gaze was like a knife, scraping at the two trembling nurses. Hand stretch out.</p>
<p>The two nurses dared not resist and tremblingly extended their hands. With one hand behind his back, Shinuan mimicked that unfathomable demeanor while using his other hand to touch each of their wrists. actually quickly using the system to probe them. Target Lee Xiaoing overall score 85. Target Xang Xiaoya.</p>
<p>Overall score 86. Even after confirming that the two were innocent and simply curious, Shin Yuans expression did not soften at all. The sound of him withdrawing his hand grew even deeper. Don&#x27;t ask questions you shouldn&#x27;t ask. Don&#x27;t ask questions you shouldn&#x27;t ask.</p>
<p>He took a step closer and the invisible pressure made the two girls legs tremble. My identity is simply a handsome guy who loves life and responds to the company&#x27;s needs. I can pretend today&#x27;s incident never happened. But if there&#x27;s a next time, it won&#x27;t be as simple as a conversation. Did you understand? He practically shouted the last sentence.</p>
<p>The two nurses were so frightened they were almost scared out of their wits. Tears welled up in their eyes and they nodded repeatedly, unable to even finish their sentences. Clearly understood. Let&#x27;s go. Shiny Yuan coldly uttered two words.</p>
<p>The two rushed out of the suite. The door slammed shut. The chilling killing intent emanating from Shun Yuan, capable of freezing a person to death, vanished without a trace. He immediately changed his expression, turned around pitifully, and pounced into Lin Chars arms like a golden retriever that had suffered a great injustice outside, hugging her slender waist and starting to throw a tantrum. Honey, I&#x27;ve been bullied.</p>
<p>That crazy woman surnamed Long is inhuman. Look, she kicked my face so hard it&#x27;s swollen. He leaned closer to show her the faint red mark on her face that hadn&#x27;t completely faded. Lynn Sharon was both amused and exasperated by his sudden change of expression, and the initial shock vanished completely. She reached out her soft little hand and gently stroked his cheek with tenderness.</p>
<p>&quot;How could she slap you in the face? Doesn&#x27;t it hurt? It hurts. My heart aches even more.&quot; Shin Yuan savors her tenderness. His large hand gently circled her flat yet warm and soft abdomen. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Lynch&#x27;s pretty face flushed red. Her body went limp and he pulled her down onto the sofa.</p>
<p>Chapter 34. A professional team, a play within a play. As explained earlier, the Umbrella Corporation is a civilian organization spontaneously formed by tens of thousands of martial artists. Umbrella Corporation headquarters, Fortress 1. Enter.</p>
<p>The door clicked open from the outside. Lean walked in carrying large bags of top quality health supplements, a warm smile on her face. The three stared at each other, creating an extremely awkward atmosphere. H. Leun, having seen her share of storms, paused for half a second before silently retreating without changing her expression.</p>
<p>With a bang, the door slammed shut again. The movement was performed in one smooth motion, as if he hadn&#x27;t seen anything at all. Xiao Jingua quickly chimed in, striding up to Shun Yuan, patting him heavily on the shoulder and abruptly changing the subject. Kid that Natasha is much more cunning than we think. She not only requested reinforcements from headquarters, but also obtained something extremely difficult through the Life Foundation&#x27;s special channels.</p>
<p>Ziao looked at Shin Yuan with a solemn expression. The ambiguous and awkward atmosphere that had just filled the living room instantly became heavy. Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat and an ominous premonition welled up inside him. Lean didn&#x27;t say much. She turned on her wrist communicator and projected a holographic image into the air above the living room.</p>
<p>The image is somewhat blurry, indicating it was taken from a distance. At a secluded dock under the cover of night, Natasha, dressed in a black tight-fitting leather outfit, is making a deal with a mysterious figure shrouded in a black robe. The mysterious man handed her a small, unremarkable metal bottle about the size of a lipstick. This is the latest gene stealing agent jointly developed by the Free Federation and the Life Foundation, Succubus&#x27; Kiss. Leon&#x27;s voice was icy as she pointed to the small bottle in the image and explained, &quot;It is colorless and odorless, can mix with any liquid, and can even penetrate through skin contact.</p>
<p>Once it enters the target&#x27;s body through exchange, it acts like a time bomb. Within 24 hours, the target&#x27;s complete genetic sequence is stolen and copied silently and then instantly transmitted back to the Federation&#x27;s gene bank via quantum network. The entire process was silent and unnoticed. His dash Shinyuan&#x27;s back was instantly soaked with cold sweat. I felt a chill rush from my tailbone straight to my forehead.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s terrifying to even think about. He patted his chest in relief. Xiao Jingua continued, &quot;Therefore, the company&#x27;s next actions must be upgraded. Our company not only needs to lure her out and capture all the reinforcement she requested, but more importantly, we need to use a clever strategy to make her believe she has succeeded before she even uses this thing. Only in this way can she and the organization behind her completely lower their guard, thereby revealing the entire spy network lurking in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>Shinyuan understood, &quot;This is going to be a big deal. A spy thriller, a movie within a movie. But here&#x27;s the problem. Turn the tables on them. How do we do that? But the biggest problem now is Leian rubbed her temples looking like she had a headache.</p>
<p>You need a few brothers who look like the ultimate playboys to help you put on this show. The martial artists in the company are all menacing. If you asked them to play Playboys, they&#x27;d be exposed at a glance. Their muscles wouldn&#x27;t be able to be hidden. It&#x27;s true that the image of a group of tough, disciplined men who are used to obeying orders playing the role of Playboy Playboys is too beautiful to imagine.</p>
<p>Just when everyone was worried about finding the right actors, with a bang, the sweet door was pushed open again. A young man dressed in an extremely flashy floral shirt with his hair dyed granny gray and a thick gold chain around his neck, strolled in lazily, a cigar dangling from his lips. Behind him were three equally distinguished young men, each more arrogant than the last. The young man in the lead popped down on the sofa, crossed his legs, and glanced around with a nonchalant look before finally settling on Xiao Jingua and Le Yun. Uncle Xiao Aunt Lee, I heard there&#x27;s a big show going to be performed.</p>
<p>He grinned, a smile brimming with the excitement of someone who thrives on chaos in the entire East China Sea. Who is more professional at playing the role of scum and degenerate than the four young masters of the East China Sea? Shinuan stared at these rich second generation villains who looked exactly like characters straight out of a novel. His eyes practically popping out of their sockets. That look, that aura, that tone of voice. Major, that&#x27;s  professional.</p>
<p>You bunch of good for nothings do nothing all day long. Le jokingly scolded him, but her eyes were full of affection and trust. She turned to Shin Yuan, who was still somewhat dazed, and introduced him. Shinyuan, let me introduce you. This one, she said, pointing to the young man in the floral shirt who was leading the group.</p>
<p>Zhao E, whose father is the richest man in Donghai City. Then she pointed to a young man behind him who wore gold rimmed glasses, looked refined but had a gloomy look in his eyes. He was Chin Foam, whose grandfather was the president of the East China branch of the Imperial Bank. And that muscular man, Sun Wu, is the eldest grandson of the Sun family, a martial arts clan. The Last Pretty Boy by Jing.</p>
<p>His father is the mayor of Donghai City. After introducing them in one breath, Lie Yun summarized, &quot;These four are the famous four young masters of Donghai City. Truly top tier second generation rich kids born with silver spoons in their mouths. Each of them possesses the strength of a third realm martial artist, and they are usually arrogant and doineering, having done no shortage of bad things. They are the perfect candidates to play the role of spoiled brats.</p>
<p>Of course, they are also absolutely reliable family members. The young man in the floral shirt who was leading the group, Zhao Ei, stood up and walked up to Shun Yuan, reaching out to look him up and down with admiration and curiosity in his eyes. Zhoi grinned and patted Shun Yuans shoulder forcefully. That&#x27;s impressive. I like it.</p>
<p>My name is Zoe. If you need anything in Dong Hai, just say my name and I&#x27;ll protect you, bro. Looking at the friendly and kindred spirit in front of him, Shin Yuan felt much more at ease. With such professional teammates playing themselves, tonight&#x27;s show is a sure thing. Shinuan grinned as well and shook hands with Zoe.</p>
<p>Friendships between men can sometimes be that simple. A single glance or a single word can instantly bridge the distance between people. Looking at this group of professional playboys in front of him, Shinuan&#x27;s lips curled into a wicked smile. Chapter 35. S-rank Fiery Dragon Bloodline.</p>
<p>The villainous team makes its debut. Now that everyone&#x27;s here, let&#x27;s get down to business. Leun interrupted the rapidly warming revolutionary friendship among the men. She glanced at the clock on the wall, her expression turning serious. Tonight&#x27;s operation is cenamed Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan is the lead attacker, and the four of you are wing men responsible for coordinating and holding the line for me. However, before we can begin, we need a crucial tool. As Le Yun spoke, she turned her gaze toward the doorway. The laboratory door slid open silently, and Su Chingu walked in gracefully, wearing her signature red high heels. She carried a silver metal briefcase, and her intelligent and beautiful face still wore that calm and professional expression.</p>
<p>But as soon as Shin Yuan saw her, especially the box in her hand, his heart tightened. This woman is definitely up to no good. As expected, Su Chingu walked up to the group, placed her suitcase on the table, and made a soft click. She opened the box, but instead of the bottles and jars Shin Yuan had imagined, there was only a lone syringe filled with dark red liquid. The needle was thicker and longer than the one he had seen before.</p>
<p>What? Another injection? Shin Yuan instinctively took a step back, almost bumping his but into Lin Churn behind him. The fear of being dominated by dragon blood number five last time. The excruciating pain that felt like being worse than dead instantly surged into my heart. He&#x27;s already traumatized by this thing. Such seemed to enjoy his ghostly expression.</p>
<p>She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, a playful smile, curving her lips, and said slowly and deliberately in a suggestive tone, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid. This injection won&#x27;t hurt. It doesn&#x27;t hurt. Nobody would believe you.&quot; Shin Yuan mentally cursed. &quot;You said the same thing last time.</p>
<p>This is a gene camouflage potion I specially made for you overnight. Such picked up the terrifying syringe and waved it at the light. It can temporarily simulate a powerful S-level flame dragon bloodline talent gene, perfectly matching your strength as a second realm martial artist, enough to convince any gene detection device that it is real and the effect lasts for 24 hours. She paused, a slightly glint in her eyes behind her glasses. Moreover, the trace of dragon blood it contains will make you even more valiant tonight.</p>
<p>More valiant? Shinyuan&#x27;s ears immediately perked up. He instantly understood the subtext of those three words, and his resistance and fear were immediately replaced by intense anticipation and excitement. He secretly glanced at Su Ching Xus intelligent and beautiful face. The speed at which his expression changed left the four young masters of the east se completely stunned. Zhaoi leaned close to Shun Yuans ear, nudged him with his elbow, and whispered with a wink, &quot;Brother, you&#x27;re a tough guy.</p>
<p>You can bend and stretch. You&#x27;ll fight tooth and nail for happiness in your lower body.&quot; Leun walked to Shun Yuans side, patted him heavily on the shoulder, and gave him her highest instructions. Understood? Shin Yuan responded loudly, feeling as if the blood in his entire body was on fire. Zhaoi whistled, put his arm around Shun Yuans shoulder and laughed like a street urchin about to do something naughty. He winked at Shun Yuan and held up three fingers.</p>
<p>Remember the three laws of scum. First, if you&#x27;re rich, let everyone know you&#x27;re rich. Second, if you fancy a girl, snatch her whether she wants to or not. Third, and most importantly, if anyone dares to show off to you, shower them with money until they kneel and call you grandpa. Shin Yuan nodded repeatedly, thinking to himself, as expected of a professional.</p>
<p>This summary is so insightful. Everything is ready. Nightfalls. In the underground parking garage of the Umbrella Corporation, five top-of-the-line hover cars, each with an increasingly extravagant design and a roaring engine, are poised to go. Sitting in his shadow beetle, Shin Yuan looked at Zhao Yis Golden Sacred Dragon, which was made entirely of gold and extremely flashy, and felt that his car seemed a bit too understated.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you all ready?&quot; Lis voice rang out on their private communication channel. &quot;Ready,&quot; the five responded in unison. &quot;Set off.&quot; With Lion&#x27;s command, the five hover cars shot out of the underground garage like five arrows and merged into the steel torrent of Donghai City. Boom! Boom! Boom! The roar of the engine tore through the night sky. This street racing convoy completely disregarded all traffic rules, weaving through traffic on busy main roads and aggressively squeezing past ordinary hover cars.</p>
<p>All the vehicles swerve to the sides in panic, fearing they would be caught in the crossfire of these lunatics. Pedestrians on the roadside stopped in their tracks, took out their phones, and frantically took pictures, their gazes filled with a mixture of awe, envy, and jealousy. Holy crap. Those are the four young masters of the East China Sea. How did they end up together? Whose black car is that leading one? I&#x27;ve never seen it before.</p>
<p>How come Zhao Xiao and his group are following behind it? Wow, this is impressive. Even the vice mayor of Donghai City would have to make way for him. Hearing the exclamations of passers by over the communication channel, Shin Yuan felt a surge of heroic spirit in his chest. This is what life is all about. At the last intersection before arriving at the phantom bar, Shinuan took out the gene disguised serum from his storage compartment.</p>
<p>He looked at the thick needle and his Adam&#x27;s apple bobbed involuntarily. But when he thought of Su Chingus words about being even more courageous, he stealed his heart, closed his eyes, and suddenly plunged the needle into his arm, pushing all the medicine in. His a stream of scorching heat like magma instantly surged from my arm throughout my entire body. He felt his blood boiling and his bones trembling with excitement. An extremely aggressive and destructive force surged from the depths of every cell in his body.</p>
<p>He suddenly opened his eyes and two golden flames were faintly burning in his dark eyes. Srank flame dragon bloodline. Limited time offer 24 hours. Activate at the entrance of Phantom Bar. Bang.</p>
<p>The gullwing doors of five top-of-the-line hover sports cars rose up in unison at the same moment. Amidst the jaw-dropping stairs of all the security guards and passers by at the entrance, Shin Yuan and the four young masters of Dong Hai leisurely stepped out of the car. The bar&#x27;s alluring female manager, Lin May, had been waiting at the door for quite some time. When she saw this terrifying scene that could practically turn the entire Dongai city upside down with its financial power, her legs went weak with fear, but she had no choice but to force out the most obsequious and humble smile as she jogged over to greet them. Young Master Yuan, Young Master Zhao, gentlemen, please come in.</p>
<p>Please come in. Her voice was trembling, and she dared not meet anyone&#x27;s gaze, only bowing her head repeatedly. The starry sky palace on the top floor is ready for you. Chapter 36. Internal strife among the aces.</p>
<p>Who will be the hunter tonight? Under the almost fawning guidance of the female manager, Lin May, Shin Yuan, and his group swaggered into the phantom bar. Wherever they went, the once noisy and frenzied dance floor instantly fell silent. Everyone&#x27;s eyes were drawn to them like iron filings attracted by a magnet. All focusing on this villainous group with an aura so powerful it was suffocating. Zhao Ei and his companions were clearly used to being the center of attention.</p>
<p>Each of them wore an arrogant smile and glanced contemptuously at the men and women around them who were looking at them with awe, enjoying the thrill of being high above them. Shin Yuan walked at the front, feeling the scorching and violent power of the flame dragon bloodline within his body, exuding an aura of doineering power that kept strangers at bay. He didn&#x27;t even need to act. The aura of his S-class bloodline was enough to make the ordinary martial artists around him feel terrified. The group walked through the crowded lobby and entered a private sightseeing elevator.</p>
<p>The elevator ascended smoothly, completely shutting out the noise below. Meanwhile, inside the starry sky hall private room on the top floor, the atmosphere was tense and somber. Natasha, dressed in a black, tight-fitting leather dress, stood before seven equally hot and beautiful female spies, issuing her final instructions in a cold tone. Remember, your mission tonight is to use your bodies and your charm to entangle the targets four companions at all costs. They are the most spoiled brats in Don High City.</p>
<p>leerous, greedy, and stupid, making them the best target. I want you to uncover every single secret they hold. The seven female spies responded in unison, their eyes gleaming with the excitement of hunters. However, just as Natasha was preparing to give her final pep talk, a lazy yet slightly mocking voice came from the sofa in the main seat. Natasha, are you sure you weren&#x27;t drained dry by someone else? A blonde beauty, even more voluuptuous and alluring than Natasha, wearing a red miniskirt that seemed to burst at the seams of her stunning figure, was reclining on the sofa, slowly swirling the red wine in her glass.</p>
<p>She was Natasha&#x27;s superior in this operation. Angelina, one of the top agents of the Free Federation&#x27;s Intelligence Division 7, cenamed Viper. Angelina put down her wine glass, stood up, and stroed over to Natasha. Her bright blue eyes were filled with undisguised contempt and jealousy. I really don&#x27;t understand why Headquarters would send you here.</p>
<p>She stretched out her finger, painted with bright red nail polish, and poked Natasha&#x27;s shoulder. I heard that our ace Black Widow was so exhausted by a target who hadn&#x27;t even reached the third realm that she couldn&#x27;t get out of bed the next day. If this gets back to the Federation, it&#x27;ll be a disgrace to our seventh intelligence division. Natasha&#x27;s face instantly darkened and she clenched her fists. Last night&#x27;s experience is the biggest stain on her career.</p>
<p>Angelina seemed to enjoy Natasha&#x27;s discomforted expression. She circled Natasha as if admiring a flawed work of art. So to ensure the mission goes perfectly, I will personally take over this man tonight. Angelina stopped in front of Natasha. A triumphant smile on her face.</p>
<p>You. A flash of anger crossed Natasha&#x27;s eyes. Angelina, don&#x27;t forget this is the target I discovered and locked onto. He&#x27;s my prey. your prey.</p>
<p>Angelina laughed exaggeratedly. Don&#x27;t be ridiculous, Natasha. You just got lucky. And bumped into him. She leaned close to Natasha&#x27;s ear, her voice filled with disdain.</p>
<p>I am the true expert who knows how to use my body to uncover all of a man&#x27;s secrets. Your so-called fighting skills and charm are utterly useless against a real man. And I, Angelina, puffed out my proud chest, my face radiating absolute confidence, knowing that I would make him willingly give me his heart, his secrets, and everything he had in the throws of ultimate pleasure. Hearing these shameless remarks, Natasha felt a wave of nausea. She looked down on the woman in front of her from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>Angelina&#x27;s talent and looks are far inferior to mine. She has climbed to where she is today entirely by selling her body in different men&#x27;s beds. This is the method that Natasha despises and looks down upon the most. But she had to admit that Angelina&#x27;s bedroom skills were indeed very effective against those lustful and foolish men. What? You&#x27;re not convinced? Angelina&#x27;s smile grew even more smug as she looked at Natasha&#x27;s angry but speechless expression.</p>
<p>She patted Natasha&#x27;s face, her tone as if she were scolding a disobedient subordinate. Remember your place, Natasha. I am the commander of this operation, and you must obey my orders. Now take your sisters and go serve those four idiots well. As for the most delicious main course, that&#x27;s mine.</p>
<p>Natasha&#x27;s fingernails were almost embedded in her palms. She stared intently at Angelina&#x27;s face, which was etched with the air of a victor. The air between them seemed to crackle with tension, and the atmosphere was incredibly tense. Just as this civil war was about to break out, suddenly, Lin May&#x27;s urgent and slightly frightened voice came through the communicator in the private room. Boss Lady, Lord Viper, the target has arrived at the door with his men.</p>
<p>Angelina&#x27;s smug smile instantly became even brighter. She turned to face the holographic mirror in the private room, adjusted her already extremely low neckline, and then licked her full red lips with her tongue, her eyes gleaming with a greedy and excited light. The perfect prey belongs to the strongest hunter. She turned around and gave Natasha a defiant look. Natasha, watch closely.</p>
<p>This is how I make men go crazy for me. A civil war that was on the verge of breaking out has been temporarily suspended. But both Natasha and Angelina had the same idea in their hearts. This man must be mine tonight. Chapter 37.</p>
<p>The emperor chooses his concubines. Tonight you are all mine. Bang. Zhao E kicked open the heavy door of the starry sky palace private room. Shin Yuan with his hands in his pockets was the first to walk in.</p>
<p>A flash of golden flame crossed his eyes as he lazily surveyed the luxurious private room. He ignored the maids standing bowing on either side and walked straight to the sofa in front of the main seat, grabbing the female manager, Lin May, who was pale with fright, and pulled her over. He pinched Lin May&#x27;s smooth chin, forcing her to raise her head, and a half smile appeared on his lips. &quot;Little beauty, I remember you. How much do you earn working under Madame Red in a month? You&#x27;re working so hard.</p>
<p>Has she given you a raise? Lin May felt flustered by his aggressive gaze and flattered quickly shook her head, her voice trembling. Mr. Shan is joking. My wife has been very kind to me. I&#x27;m not doing this for money.</p>
<p>Huh? Shin Yuan sneered inwardly. The moment he touched Lin May, the system panel clearly provided the answer. Strategy suggestion. A money grubber whose loyalty is tied to money. He has been bought off by Black Widow Natasha for 10 times the price.</p>
<p>What a great kindness in recognizing and supporting someone. Shin Yuan released her, tossing her aside like a rag, his eyes instantly turning to ice. Behind him, Zhoi plopped down on the sofa, propped up his expensive limited edition sneakers on the priceless rosewood coffee table and yelled impatiently, &quot;Where are they? Damn it, you&#x27;ve kept us waiting this long. If they don&#x27;t come out soon, I&#x27;m tearing this lousy shop down today.&quot; Shinfo, Sun Wu, and Bai Jing immediately started to cheer. Xian Fong picked up a crystal ashtray, weighted in his hand, and then smashed it directly onto the holographic projection wall with a bang, creating a distorted snowflake effect.</p>
<p>TSK, this wallpaper is really flimsy. Sun Wu then grabbed a trembling maid and chuckled. Come here, let your brother see if your body is flexible enough. By Jing was even more direct. He pulled out a thick wad of credits from his pocket, scattered them into the air, and laughed wildly.</p>
<p>Whoever dances for me to liven things up, all of these are hers. The entire private room was instantly turned into a chaotic mess by them. Just then, the inner door of the private room slowly opened. Natasha and Angelina, accompanied by seven meticulously dressed female spies, walked out gracefully. When they saw the mess inside the private room, everyone except Natasha, showed a hint of surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>They never expected that these so-called top tier second generation rich kids would be so vulgar and barbaric. But Shen Yuan&#x27;s gaze only swept over the stunning crowd for a moment before locking onto Natasha. He stood up and stroed over to Natasha, completely ignoring the even more voluuptuous Angelina beside her and forcefully pulled Natasha into his arms. He whispered with a laugh in her ear. &quot;Honey, did you miss me?&quot; Natasha&#x27;s body stiffened for a moment, then relaxed, a charming smile spreading across her face, her breath sweet as orchids.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, I think of you every single minute when you&#x27;re not around.&quot; &quot;Is that so?&quot; Shin yuan chuckled, hooking her chin with his finger to make her look directly at him, but deliberately raised his voice a few decibels so that everyone could hear. His performance was all right. He was just like a block of wood, completely lacking in charm. However, since you&#x27;ve been relatively obedient, I&#x27;ll give you another chance today. Learn well, watch carefully, and serve me well, and you&#x27;ll be rewarded.&quot; These words were like a resounding slap in the face, striking Natasha&#x27;s pride hard.</p>
<p>Her face still wore a perfect smile, but a cold, killing intent flashed in the depths of her beautiful eyes. Seeing this, Zhaoi immediately got into character. He kicked over the coffee table in front of him, scattering expensive wines all over the floor. He pointed at Natasha and roared. Damn it, brother.</p>
<p>You on? Is this all the trash you have? Are you trying to fob us off like beggars? Are you looking down on us, brothers? If you dare to try and fool us with those secondhand items that have been played with by who knows how many people, I&#x27;ll really tear down your lousy bar today. That doineering and unreasonable arrogance sent a chill down the spines of the female spies present. When faced with Zhao Yis challenge, Natasha simply clapped her hands calmly. The inner door opened again, and the seven exotic beauties who were already prepared filed in like models on a runway. They were all tall and slender, exuding charm and wearing only a few thin pieces of fabric.</p>
<p>Zhao Ei and the others stared wideeyed. Shin Yuan released Natasha and like an emperor inspecting his harum, slowly walked up to the seven female spies. He reached out and under the pretense of reading their palms, touched each of their small hands. Target Eva, Seale spy, talent soft bones. Target Sophia, D-LE spy, talent, none.</p>
<p>The system panel refreshed rapidly, displaying all the information about the seven people. They&#x27;re all cannon fodder sent by the Free Federation. There&#x27;s not even a single person with a B-grade talent. Shiny Yuan understood, but a satisfied smile appeared on his face. Excellent.</p>
<p>Excellent. All good stuff. Seeing that he had touched each one, Zhaoi immediately became impatient and started yelling, &quot;All right, all right, Auan, one is enough for you. Don&#x27;t try to take it from us.&quot; As he spoke, he directly pulled his arm around the hottest blonde woman. Shin Yuan pulled the equally surprised Natasha back into his arms and whispered praise in her ear.</p>
<p>&quot;My darling is the most sensible and efficient.&quot; Natasha forced a smile despite her discomfort and was about to speak. &quot;Zhao E is causing trouble again. He treated a bottle of blood lamb worth 100,000 like mineral water, gulping down half of it. Then he grabbed a handful of credit point checks, scattered them into the air, and laughed wildly. Tonight&#x27;s expenses are on me.</p>
<p>Play music. Dance for me. He perfectly embodied the aura of a top tier second generation rich kid who squanders money like water and treats human life as worthless. Shinuan looked at the chaotic and extravagant scene and chuckled inwardly. These teammates are definitely professionals.</p>
<p>Just then, Angelina, who had been waiting outside for a long time, finally couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. She entered carrying a bottle of blood crystal wine that looked several times superior to blood rum and swayed her hips with captivating charm. She walked straight towards Shin Yuan, completely ignoring Natasha in his arms, her voice sickeningly sweet. It&#x27;s no fun for a handsome young man to play with such an immature girl. How about I have a drink with you? Chapter 38.</p>
<p>A killer of 10,000. Do you want this good fortune? Angelina Jolie intervened. She pushed Natasha aside, her voluuptuous body almost entirely pressed against Shin Yuans arm, making no attempt to conceal her intentions. Hello, I&#x27;m Natasha&#x27;s cousin, Angelina. She winked at Shin Yuan, her voice so seductive it could melt your heart.</p>
<p>My cousin has always been shy and immature, so let your older sister take care of you. As she spoke, she picked up a clean wine glass from the table, filled the bottle of blood crystal wine worth millions in her hand, then raised the glass, and gently pressed a bright red lip print onto the rim of the glass with her full red lips. She handed the glass of wine, which carried her scent, to Shun Yuan, her azure eyes filled with blatant seduction. Want to try my sister&#x27;s flavor? Shin Yuan sneered inwardly. Goodness, this method is much more direct than Natasha&#x27;s.</p>
<p>He did not refuse and reached out to take the wine glass. The moment his fingertips touched Angelina&#x27;s warm fingers. The system panel in his mind exploded. An epic amount of data is going viral. Name: Angelina.</p>
<p>Code name Viper. Age 30. Talent grade B skin hardening. Realm Grand Marshall Master of the Third Realm. Appearance rating 94.</p>
<p>Stylish. Body type rating 97. Number of times 12,531. Number of partners 342. Overall rating 93.</p>
<p>Puff dash. Shinyuan almost spat out the wine he had just drunk. He understood instantly. Natasha at least managed to get by thanks to her A-level mental talent and status as a top agent. While this guy in front of her is just a workaholic who climbed to the top by sheer physical strength.</p>
<p>A wave of nausea surged from my stomach straight up to my throat. He had absolutely no interest in these public toilets. A brighter smile appeared on his face. He picked up his wine glass, but didn&#x27;t drink it. Instead, he turned his head and looked at Joe E, who was on the sofa next to him, groping a female spy.</p>
<p>&quot;Eg, look how deserted your place is. How can one person be enough for you to play with?&quot; Shinuan stood up, grabbed the still somewhat bewildered Angelina, and pushed her directly towards Zoe. &quot;Such a wonderful cousin, so charming and passionate. She deserves a hero like you.&quot; Natasha, who had been pushed aside, instinctively stiffened. As she watched Angelina being ruthlessly pushed away by Shun Yuan, her heart tightened at first, followed by an indescribable surge of pleasure.</p>
<p>This woman, who rose to power by selling her body, always acted superior, but now she was being despised like trash by her target. Natasha&#x27;s lips curled into a slight, uncontrollable smile, her eyes filled with a mocking, smug look of anticipation. Zhao E was enjoying his decadent life when he was suddenly stunned to see Shin Yuan pushing a living person toward him. But when he saw the undisguised disgust and resistance on Shaun Yuans face, he who had been a womanizer for many years, instantly understood. This woman&#x27;s mileage is absolutely off the charts.</p>
<p>He immediately waved his hand, his face instantly changing to a righteous and chivalous expression, and pushed away the female spy in his arms. No, no, no. Are you on? What are you saying? Joey stood up and pushed Angelina back. You are the star of the night. How could we, as your brothers, take such a beauty from you? You are disrespecting me, Joey.</p>
<p>Angelina was being pushed around like a ball by the two men, and the charming smile on her face completely froze. When has she ever been insulted like this? In the Free Federation, the men who want to sleep with her could line up from the east side of the city to the west side. Today, in front of these two spoiled brats from the Dragon Sea Empire, they were actually treated like trash and looked down upon. Her face turned from red to green, then from green to black, and her chest heaved violently. On the other side of the sofa, Chin foam, Sun Wu, and Bai Jing not only did not help, but instead watched the commotion and loudly cheered.</p>
<p>Eg, just given that beautiful woman is throwing herself at you. Why are you pretending to be a gentleman? Son Wu was even more direct. He pushed the woman in his arms down and grinned wickedly. Exactly. Eg.</p>
<p>Look at that physique. So hot. If you&#x27;re not going to go for it, let me have it. I love this mature look the most. Brother E.</p>
<p>This is a blessing for you. Do you want it? Bing whistled from the side. The jeers and laughter mingled together like needles piercing Angelina&#x27;s heart. Shin Yuan and Zhao E then engaged in a spectacular Tai Chi push hands match. Brother E, don&#x27;t be shy.</p>
<p>Good things should be shared with your brothers. No, no. My brother&#x27;s wife is not to be trifled with. Although she&#x27;s not your wife yet, she is tonight. I can&#x27;t do such an immoral thing.</p>
<p>Angelina, the Viper, whose fame was widespread in the federal intelligence community, was ignored at this moment, being pushed back and forth between two men. The expression on her face had changed from anger to humiliation and finally turned into ferocity. She had reached her breaking point. She had never suffered such a humiliation. Just as Shen Yuan pushed her into Zhao Yis arms again, a flash of mad ruthlessness appeared in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>She grabbed Zho Yis flashy floral shirt collar with lightning speed. Amidst the stunned and speechless gazes of everyone in the private room, Angelina kissed Zhao E hard on the lips. Ugg. Zho Yis mind went completely blank for a moment. His eyes were wide open like saucers, and he made muffled sobs.</p>
<p>He tried frantically to push her away, but Angelina held him tightly and he couldn&#x27;t move. What? I&#x27;ve been in the East China Sea for 10 years, and I&#x27;ve slept with at least 80 or 100 young models and celebrities. And today, I was actually forcibly kissed by a woman who&#x27;s been with thousands of men. The private room fell into a deathly silence. Immediately, Shin Fo, Sun Wu, and Bai Jing burst into thunderous laughter and jeers.</p>
<p>O Dash, Ego is awesome. Igu is awesome. He sacrificed himself for love. Zhao Yis face turned a deep purplish red. Society is dead.</p>
<p>This is an epic social disaster. Chapter 39. A plan to turn the tide. The hunt begins. While everyone was laughing hysterically at Joe Yi&#x27;s ridiculous behavior.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan hugged Natasha, who was also somewhat takenback. He leaned close to her ear, his hot breath brushing against her earlobe, and chuckled softly in a tone of amusement. Your older cousin is more adventurous than you. Natasha&#x27;s lips twitched violently. She just wanted to pretend she didn&#x27;t know that shameful Angelina.</p>
<p>She quickly adjusted her mindset and forcibly ignored the farce happening over there. Little brother, don&#x27;t worry about them. Natasha took out a small exquisite metal bottle about the size of a lipstick that she had prepared beforehand from under the sofa. She gave Shin Yuan a seductive smile. Let&#x27;s do something exciting.</p>
<p>She unscrewed the small bottle, poured the colorless and odorless liquid inside into two clean wine glasses, and then filled them with blood rum. This is a secret medicine I brought from the Western Continent. It can make men incredibly viral, and having sex twice a night is no problem. She picked up one of the glasses, winked at Shin Yuan, and hinted, &quot;Let&#x27;s play dice. Whoever loses gets to drink one of these speciallymade celebratory drinks.</p>
<p>How about it?&quot; She didn&#x27;t believe any man in the world could resist such temptation. &quot;It&#x27;s here.&quot; Shin Yuan sneered inwardly. The real drama was finally about to begin. His face immediately showed great interest, and he snatched the dice cup that Natasha handed him. &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s such a good thing.</p>
<p>Come on, I&#x27;m possessed by the god of gamblers. I&#x27;ll make you lose everything today. The game begins.&quot; Shin Yuan shook the dice cup exaggeratedly, and the crisp sound of the dice hitting each other was particularly clear in the noisy private room. Thud. He slammed the dice cup down on the table.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll open 6:00. Haha, I won, huh? Shin Yuan deliberately miscalculated the points, figning surprise, then waved his hand impatiently. Damn, I miscalculated. Oh dear, it seems your luck isn&#x27;t so good, little brother. Natasha giggled and pushed the poisoned wine laced with drugs in front of Shen Yuan.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded wildly with excitement. As long as he drinks it, his genetic sequence will be transmitted back to headquarters. What is this humiliation? Meeting her expectant and nervous gaze, Shin Yuan did not hesitate at all. He picked up his wine glass and drank the wine mixed with the succubus&#x27;s kiss in one gulp. The warm liquid slid down his throat and a strange energy spread throughout his body.</p>
<p>Ding. High-risk gene stealing agent succubus&#x27; kiss detected. Gene camouflage program activated. S- level flame dragon bloodline gene information begins to be released. Disguise successful.</p>
<p>Shiny yuan wiped his mouth and revealed an extremely satisfied expression. He even let out a serious looking burp and then flexed his biceps in front of Natasha. Good licker. It&#x27;s potent. I feel like I have all the energy in my body.</p>
<p>He looked at Natasha&#x27;s smug expression of impending success and his smile became meaningful. Now it&#x27;s my turn. The second game begins. This time the frivolity on Shun Yuan&#x27;s face disappeared and he entered a state of absolute focus. With just a slight flick of his wrist, the dice in the dice cup emitted a rhythmic crisp sound.</p>
<p>Before the dice cup even hit the ground, he had already announced the numbers inside. Three sixes, 1 5 1, 24 points. Natasha, skeptical, opened the dice cup and saw the numbers. No more, no less. Exactly the same as the number of points Shinuan reported.</p>
<p>Your turn, Natasha. Shinuan picked up the wine bottle and poured Natasha a glass of the same wine to celebrate. He pushed the wine glass towards her and urged, &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s return the favor. You should also try this good stuff.&quot; Natasha&#x27;s expression turned ugly for half a second. Although the succubus&#x27; kiss is harmless to the human body, it is, after all, a gene-enhancing drug and may produce some unpredictable side effects, but now they&#x27;re in a bind.</p>
<p>Under Shin Yuan&#x27;s amused gaze, and amidst the jeers of the surrounding spoiled young man, she simply couldn&#x27;t refuse. Drink, drink, drink. Zhao E, who had just recovered from the shock of the incident, couldn&#x27;t resist the urge to stir up trouble and was the first to start banging on the table and cheering. Natasha gritted her teeth, a ruthless glint flashing in her eyes. Under the expectant gazes of everyone, she picked up her glass, stealed herself, and down the entire glass of wine in one gulp.</p>
<p>Huh, great. That&#x27;s awesome. Upon seeing this, Shinyuan let out a satisfied laugh. He swept Natasha, whose cheeks were flushed in unnatural red after finishing her drink, into his arms once again in a standard princess carry. Zhao.</p>
<p>He looked at the closed door, then at Angelina in his arms, who was still in a daysaze, but whose eyes were starting to look strange. He made a face that looked worse than crying. Damn it. Why? Why does he get to marry the beauty while I have to be publicly executed here? The large bed in the bedroom was bathed in the mesmerizing glow of the starry sky outside the window. When the first rays of sunlight streamed through the French windows onto her face the next morning, Natasha slowly opened her once vibrant blue eyes.</p>
<p>At this moment, Shin Yuan, with his muscular upper body bear, stood in front of the window, basking in the morning light, stretching. His muscles were sharply defined, glistening with a healthy glow in the sunlight, and an explosive masculine power emanated from his very contours. He looked more energetic and full of vitality. Shin Yuan felt the primordial energy within his body, which had become even hotter and more violent due to the fiery dragon bloodline. And only one word remained in his mind.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xus words about bravery were absolutely true. He glanced back at the stunning spy on the bed, a cold smile curving his lips. S-rank flame dragon bloodline. Federal Fools, enjoy this great gift from the Umbrella Corporation. Chapter 40.</p>
<p>Spy collapses. The net closes. Shinyuan walked towards her. Are you awake, my little wild cat? He walked to the bedside, bent down, and slowly ran his fingers across Natasha&#x27;s bloodless cheek. How was it? Were you satisfied with the drinks that went well last night? Natasha&#x27;s body trembled and tears of humiliation uncontrollably streamed down her face.</p>
<p>She bit her lip tightly, unable to utter a single word. It seems you are quite satisfied. Mr. Shan, you are truly a cruel devil who only knows how to manipulate people&#x27;s hearts. Haha, I like this nickname.</p>
<p>Shinuan laughed and straightened up. Under Natasha&#x27;s friendly gaze, he walked to the door. Suddenly, he turned around and smiled. Get some rest, my little wild cat. Bang.</p>
<p>The moment the door closed, Natasha could no longer hold back and let out a shrill, desperate scream. A dash. Like a mad woman, she grabbed everything she could on the bed, pillows, blankets, lamps, and smashed them wildly against the closed door. When all the strength has been released, but she was, after all, a top-notch spy. After a brief period of emotional outburst, Reason regained its advantage.</p>
<p>She wiped away her tears, struggled to get out of bed, and retrieved a miniature quantum communicator from a very well-hidden compartment in the wall. The S-level flame dragon bloodline gene information we have obtained must be transmitted back to headquarters immediately. This was the only victory she won by sacrificing her dignity and innocence. Once the information is relayed back, all the humiliation she suffered will become worthwhile. Natasha will become a hero of the free federation.</p>
<p>and the man who humiliated her will become a lamb to the slaughter under the Federation&#x27;s genetic weapons. Thinking of this, Natasha&#x27;s eyes rekindled with the flames of revenge. With trembling fingers, she pressed the send button. Outside the Phantom Bar, Zhao E, sporting two enormous dark circles under his eyes, leaned against his sports car with a look of utter despair, an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth, exuding an aura of utterly a is a difficult word to translate directly, but it conveys a sense of listlessness. Apathy and apathy as if he had been completely ruined.</p>
<p>That woman named Angelina is a complete scoundrel. Not only did she forcefully kiss him, but she also clung to him like an octopus, forcing him to play truth or dare all night long, almost getting all the embarrassing things he had ever done since he was a child out of him. My innocence is in jeopardy. Sun Wu, Chin Foam, and Bai Jing were in no better condition. They all looked like scholars whose young energy had been drained by demons.</p>
<p>Their faces pale and their steps unsteady. Damn, these women are too fierce. I almost died in their last night. Sun Wu rubbed his waist with lingering fear. Who says otherwise? Brother Yuan is such a scoundrel.</p>
<p>He went off to have fun while we&#x27;re left here to die for the company. Bing said with a resentful expression. Just as they were venting to each other, the bar door opened. Shin Yuan emerged from inside looking refreshed and radiant, his face beaming with the satisfaction of a gluttonous meal. The four men were furious when they saw him like this.</p>
<p>Brother Yuan, you&#x27;ve finally come out. If you hadn&#x27;t come out, our reputation would have collapsed. Zhao Ei was the first to rush up, grabbing Shinuans leg and starting to cry. Shin Yuan looked at the four of them, who looked completely drained and burst into laughter, patting Zho Yi&#x27;s shoulder heavily. Thanks for your hard work, brothers.</p>
<p>Consider this a free labor service. Next time I encounter a beautiful exotic woman, you guys will be the first people I think of. Real. When have I ever lied to you? Just then, Shin Yuans wrist communicator vibrated slightly. It was a message from Le Yun.</p>
<p>The fish has taken the bait. Time to haul in the net. The headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, the highest command center on the huge holographic screen. Every move inside the starry sky hall on the top floor of the Phantom Bar was clearly displayed. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingwa both stared at the screen with serious expressions.</p>
<p>When they saw Natasha&#x27;s trembling fingers pressed the send button on the miniature quantum communicator, one of the technicians jumped to his feet and shouted excitedly, &quot;Intercepted. Signal intercepted. Replacing data packets. Replacement successful. Fake gene sequence sent.&quot; The entire command center erupted in an uncontrollable cheer.</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, these federal idiots really think they&#x27;ve struck gold.&quot; Ziao Jinga slammed his fist on the table, his face flushed. Leun immediately issued final instructions to the special forces warriors who had already been deployed around the bar via the internal channel. Action inside the bedroom of the Starry Sky Palace. Natasha looked at the message on the communicator indicating that the message had been successfully sent and collapsed to the ground. Utterly exhausted, she let out a long sigh of relief, a twisted smile on her face that was a mixture of pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s all over. Shinuan, you devil, just wait for the Federation sanctions. Once a martial artist genes are leaked, the Federation has a thousand ways to control you and turn you into one of their own. Then you will be a great sinner of the Dragon Sea Empire.</p>
<p>However, the smile on her face hadn&#x27;t even fully bloomed yet. Boom. Dash. With a deafening crash, the sturdy bedroom door made of special alloy was violently blasted open from the outside. Immediately afterward, a team of fully armed special forces soldiers wearing black exoskeleton armor and wielding Gaus rifles rushed in like death itself, emerging from hell.</p>
<p>The dark muzzle of the gun locked onto Natasha, who was still in a days in an instant. Don&#x27;t move. Hands up. The chilling warning was like the pronouncement of death. Natasha&#x27;s mind went blank.</p>
<p>People from the Umbrella Corporation. How did I end up here? Could it be? A terrifying thought so terrifying it made her soul tremble. Began to frantically grow in her mind. That man, that setup, that wine, this is a trap. It&#x27;s a trap Taylor made for her from beginning to end almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>Outside the bar, dozens of hover armored vehicles descended from the sky, completely surrounding the Phantom Bar. Countless special forces warriors descended from the sky, smashed through the windows, and took control of the entire bar with overwhelming force. Those so-called sisters summoned by Natasha, who were actually other female spies sent by the Federation, had no chance to use their charms before they were held to the head with guns, their faces pale with fright, and they surrendered without resistance. A crackdown on the Federal Spy Network was launched in the final moments before dawn with overwhelming force. Chapter 41.</p>
<p>Two female spies arrested. Su Ching Zhus cunning idea. However, there can only be one true god of death. Longing didn&#x27;t even change into her glorious military uniform. She remained in a simple black tight-fitting combat suit and didn&#x27;t even bring any weapons.</p>
<p>She stood quietly in the shadow of the street light as if she had become one with the night. Boom! The floor to ceiling windows on the second floor of the bar were shattered from the inside by a violent force. Two figures, one in red and one in black, like two startled female leopards, leaped out of the broken window, attempting to break free from the air. It was Natasha and Angelina. Want to leave? Long Yings cool voice rang out in the night sky.</p>
<p>She moved. There was no earthshattering momentum. Not even a trace of energy fluctuation leaked out. Her movements were extremely simple. She simply took a step forward and her body appeared in midair.</p>
<p>The first move, reaching out, her fair, slender hand, arriving late but arriving early, lightly touched Angelina&#x27;s full breasts. Angelina&#x27;s expression changed drastically. Her B-level talent, skin hardening, activated instantly, and her entire body shimmerred with a metallic sheen as she withstood the attack. However, it was no use. Long Yings hands appeared gentle, but the power they contained was like a surging, raging torrent.</p>
<p>Click. A crisp cracking sound rang out, and Angelina&#x27;s defensive talent was as fragile as a sheet of paper in front of a fourthle grand marshall master. She spat out a mouthful of blood mist and her whole body plummeted straight down from midair like a kite with a broken string where she was firmly bound by an electromagnetic restraint net by special forces warriors who were already waiting below. One move, instant kill. Seeing this, Natasha didn&#x27;t hesitate to abandon her escape attempt.</p>
<p>She unleashed her full A-level mental charm talent, sending an invisible mental shock wave towards Long Ying. This is her strongest trump card. L Yings eyes were cold and icy without the slightest ripple. The second move, look up. She simply raised her eyes calmly and met Natasha&#x27;s gaze.</p>
<p>Boom! Natasha felt as if her mental world had been stirred up by the power of a giant dragon. Puff! Natasha bled from all seven orphases at the same time, and a tearing pain shot through her brain, plunging her consciousness into chaos. Inside Shinuan&#x27;s car, he watched the entire capture, which could be described as a gamecher, through the car&#x27;s holographic screen. His mouth was wide open, and he couldn&#x27;t close it for a long time. What is this? The true strength of an SS level talent, a fourthrem grand marshall master.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s  amazing. One B level and one A level, two grand marshall masters of the third realm, were like two little chicks in front of her and were dealt with in a single move. Shinuan couldn&#x27;t help but recall the various times he had accidentally slipped up and made fools of himself in the training room. He shivered. This woman definitely went easy on me during training.</p>
<p>If she had used even a tenth, no, a hundredth of her strength back then, she probably wouldn&#x27;t even have her ashes found now. Along with a wave of lingering fear, an even stronger desire to conquer surged wildly from the depths of his heart. Such a fierce woman. If I can subdue her in the future, I&#x27;ll see her cry and beg for mercy. Glug.</p>
<p>Shinuan felt that a certain gene in his body was starting to stir up again, much to his dismay. The atmosphere inside the cold, hard transport vehicle was extremely oppressive. Angelina was bound by speciallymade shackles, and the excruciating pain in her chest made her face deathly pale, but the look in her eyes as she looked at Natasha was filled with resentment and madness. You idiot. You&#x27;re a complete idiot who&#x27;s good for nothing and good for making things worse.</p>
<p>As the Federation&#x27;s top ace, you didn&#x27;t even realize you&#x27;ve been exposed, and you arrogantly dragged everyone down with you. You are a disgrace to our seventh intelligence division.&quot; Natasha huddled in the corner, her body trembling slightly from the intense pain of the backlash from her mental energy. She met Angelina&#x27;s crazed gaze, a mocking smile playing on her lips. I if it weren&#x27;t for your greed for credit and your insistence on taking the target from me. If it weren&#x27;t for your foolish arrogance and your insistence on taking matters into your own hands, how could we have been defeated so quickly and so thoroughly? Shut up.</p>
<p>Angelina screamed like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, trying to pounce, but was locked in place by cold shackles and could only rage helplessly. What do you know? You stupid woman who only knows how to use brute force have no idea about the art of conquering a man with your body. If it were me, that man would have already spilled all his secrets. Art. Natasha chuckled softly, her laughter filled with disdain and contempt.</p>
<p>Your shameless art will only make you a cheap  tossing and turning in different men&#x27;s beds and finally being thrown away like trash. You, Angelina, was trembling with rage. The two top female agents, once renowned for their beauty in the federal intelligence community, were now tearing each other apart like two shrewish women in the prison van, exposing each other&#x27;s most shameful sides. The Umbrella Corporation headquarters, deep underground, in a secret interrogation room. Angelina and Natasha were detained separately.</p>
<p>Leun personally took charge of interrogating Angelina. She didn&#x27;t use any instruments of torture. She simply pushed a cup of hot tea in front of Angelina with a warm smile on her face. &quot;Miss Angelina, or should I call you Viper?&quot; Angelina sneered, turned her face away, and completely ignored her. &quot;I know you aces have all undergone the most rigorous training.</p>
<p>Conventional interrogation methods are useless against you.&quot; Leun slowly sipped her tea. So, let&#x27;s talk about something else. Talk about your past, your family, and your old friends in the Federation. Every word Le Yun uttered was an attempt to dismantle Angelina&#x27;s psychological defenses. But Angelina&#x27;s willpower far exceeded her expectations.</p>
<p>No matter what Leun said, she was like a rock in a latrine, stinking and hard, impervious to reason. An hour later, Leon walked out of the interrogation room, rubbing her temples and looking exhausted. It failed. Meanwhile, in Natasha&#x27;s interrogation room, the situation was even worse. The company&#x27;s mental health interrogation expert, also a third realm martial artist, was leaning against the wall with a pale face and two wads of cotton stuffed in his nostrils to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not. He stared at Ziao Jingwa in the monitoring room, his face filled with defeat and horror. Her mental strength was too strong. Moreover, her A-level talent, mental charm, even in a passive defensive state, could actually reflect my mental strength back. I almost became an idiot.</p>
<p>In the monitoring room, Zhiao Jing was stared at the two screens, one showing a silent woman and the other resting with her eyes closed. Frustrated, he slammed his fist on the control panel. Damn it. There were two huge fish right in front of me, but their mouths were like they were welded shut. He was frantic, pacing back and forth in the room like a cat on a hot tin roof.</p>
<p>Every minute they delayed meant more time for the spy network behind them to escape. This was a huge threat to our company. Lean walked in, looked at the two faces on the screen that were giving her a headache, and sighed helplessly. I&#x27;m at my wits end. These two women are determined to become martyrs.</p>
<p>Neither physical nor psychological attacks have worked. Just when everyone was at a loss, and the entire command center fell silent. Click. The door to the monitoring room was pushed open from the outside. Such Ching Zu walked in gracefully, wearing a snow white lab coat and her signature red high heels, holding a freshly printed physiological data report.</p>
<p>A faint, enigmatic, even somewhat eerie smile graced her face. Conventional methods don&#x27;t work. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and her eyes behind the lenses gleamed with excitement and fervor. Perhaps we can try biological methods. Chapter 42.</p>
<p>Dr. Sue&#x27;s devilish plan. Shiny Yuan sacrifices himself. biological methods. Ziao Jingua was stunned for a moment and didn&#x27;t react.</p>
<p>In the conference room, everyone&#x27;s eyes were focused on Su Ching Zhu. This top genetic expert in the empire always comes up with solutions that are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Su Ching Zhu didn&#x27;t keep them in suspense. She projected the report in her hand onto the screen which contained detailed physiological data analysis of Natasha and Angelina down to each cell. Based on my analysis, although Angelina&#x27;s body has undergone multiple genetic enhancements, she is still essentially within the realm of ordinary humans and even the strongest willpower has its limits.</p>
<p>As for Natasha, Su Chingu&#x27;s eyes brightened considerably. Her situation was far more complex. Not only was she an A-level mental talent, but her body had also undergone deep genetic modification under the Black Widow Project, giving her extremely strong resistance to conventional drugs and mental attacks. However, Su Ching Xu changed the subject, a devilish smile curving her lips. Through the analysis of her micro expressions and physiological data during her interaction with Shun Yuan last night, I discovered an interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>Although she showed extreme resistance and humiliation, her body betrayed her true feelings. Su Ching Zhu pointed to a wildly fluctuating curve on the light screen and in a cold, emotionless tone uttered words that made all the men present gasp in shock. She was a complete theoretical master when it came to matters of love between men and women, but had almost zero practical experience. Therefore, I have a bold suggestion. Su Ching Zhus gaze swept across the entire room, finally landing on Shun Yuan, who had just entered the conference room, and she uttered a startling statement using the company&#x27;s top grade band drug, the breath of the fallen angel.</p>
<p>This is a potent aphrodesiac that bypasses the cerebral cortex and acts directly on the central nervous and endocrine systems. It can completely destroy a person&#x27;s willpower, amplifying their deepest desires to an extreme degree until reason completely collapses. At that point, let alone a spy network, she&#x27;ll cry and shout to tell you even if she wet the bed a few times when she was three. Upon hearing this, the entire room fell silent. Even Xiao Jingua, who is usually carefree, felt his eyelids twitch as he listened, and his square face immediately showed shock and disapproval.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous. Is this some kind of interrogation or something? This is utterly inhumane. It violates human rights. Humanitarianism? Su Chingu sneered and pushed up her glasses. Master Xiao, how can you talk about humanitarianism with terrorists who have infiltrated our hearts and are ready to detonate bombs at any time? They are spies, enemies, not civilians who need our protection.</p>
<p>Enemies should be dealt with using the most effective and direct methods. Her words left Ziao Jing was speechless for a moment. Su Chinghu turned her gaze intently to Shin Yuan. Moreover, only you can execute this plan. Me? Shin Yuan was listening with great interest when he was suddenly called out, and he was completely stunned.</p>
<p>Then, as if remembering something, he instinctively clutched his aching lower back and cried out, &quot;Dr. Sue, that&#x27;s a good suggestion. Please don&#x27;t make that suggestion again next time. My kidneys just can&#x27;t take it. What if I surrender halfway through the interrogation? He still feels weak in his kidneys.</p>
<p>Another enhanced version of Natasha. This heartfelt outpouring of emotion instantly transformed the tense and solemn atmosphere in the meeting room into something strange. Ziao Jingwas face was flushed red, his muscles twitching wildly as he tried to suppress his laughter. Lie Yun was even more direct. She glared at Shin Yuan without any politeness and scolded him irritably.</p>
<p>Stop pretending. You&#x27;re as energetic as ever. You could be interrogated 300 times over. Even Longing, who had been silent and had a cold expression, seemed to have her lips twitch almost imperceptibly. Suimo was a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it. Now everyone knows his kidneys are healed. Looking at Shun Yuan&#x27;s kidney deficiency-like appearance, Su Chingu asked teasingly, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this what you like to do most? What are you afraid of now?&quot; She walked up to Shun Yuan, her eyes sparkling with wisdom as if she could see right through him. This is just a different training method. Every day you do push-ups and sit-ups with instructor Long, a high-intensity competition that takes a huge toll on your energy.</p>
<p>Now, the training subject has simply been changed to Natasha, who is controlled by drugs, completely incapable of resisting, and will only let you do whatever you want. Don&#x27;t you want to experience this kind of training where you can do whatever you want and act recklessly? Shin Yuan&#x27;s Adams apple bobbed involuntarily. Instantly, Natasha&#x27;s humiliated and resentful pretty face as well as her fiery and alluring perfect body flashed into his mind. This doesn&#x27;t seem unacceptable. Seeing the eager expression on Shin Yuan&#x27;s face, Su Chingu knew that the fish had taken the bait.</p>
<p>Natasha, having undergone black widow genetic modification, is theoretically destined to be forever cursed with bad luck. Whether your invincible luck can break free from these genetic shackles and defy fate remains to be seen. We&#x27;ll soon find out. If you succeed, you will create a miracle that even false gods could not accomplish. You will become the greatest being in the history of genetics, defying fate.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. My unairring accuracy is a talent of the rule-based system. No matter what kind of genetic modification you have, no matter what kind of lifelong bad luck you have in the face of the systems rules, they are all just paper tigers. If it really brings Natasha good luck, that was not just completing an interrogation task, but also the ultimate verification of his own talent and potential. Moreover, Natasha&#x27;s overall score is a god-level target of 96 points.</p>
<p>What kind of reward will the system give if she succeeds? Thinking of this, Shin Yuan&#x27;s last bit of worry about kidney deficiency was immediately overwhelmed by boundless desire and expectation. On one hand, he eliminates harm for the company, wins the heart of a beauty, and incidentally, he can also immerse himself in training and enjoy emperor-like treatment. On the other hand, there is the potential for physical damage. Is there even a need to choose? Approved, Shinuan looked at Su Ching Zu and said through gritted teeth. However, the medicinal baths and tonics must be plentiful, and they must be of the highest quality.</p>
<p>Make a deal. The plan was thus finalized in an extremely absurd yet logical way. The order was quickly issued to that special cell. Two fully armed, cold-faced female doctors from the company entered Natasha&#x27;s solitary cell. Natasha looked at them wearily and asked in a cold voice, &quot;What do you want?&quot; The female doctor silently took two syringes from the metal box.</p>
<p>One of them is a speciallymade gene lock that can temporarily seal the power of a third realm martial artist within her, turning her into an ordinary woman who is completely powerless. And the other branch, it is that invitation from hell, the breath of the fallen angel, powerful enough to destroy all will. No, you can&#x27;t do this. Natasha finally realized what was happening and she struggled frantically, but her strength seemed so pale and powerless under the suppression of the cold shackles and the two secondle warriors. The cold needle pierced her smooth skin without mercy as the eerie pink liquid slowly seeped into her body.</p>
<p>Her skin began to develop an unnatural reddish blush. Her breathing became rapid and hot. The icy layer of rationality in her azure eyes was rapidly melting. Chapter 43. A painful training session.</p>
<p>The female spies submission rate reaches 80%. Shinuan walked in. He changed into a loose black silk robe, the collar slightly open, revealing his muscular chest and well-defined abs. After days of grueling training and medicinal baths, his physique has been completely transformed, no longer as thin as before. When he pushed open the door, Natasha, who was lying on the bed in a state of torment and delirium, raised her head with the last vestage of clarity that belonged to a top agent.</p>
<p>She recognized who it was. This is the man. This is the devil who deceived her, toyed with her, and sent her to hell with his own hands. It&#x27;s you. Natasha leaped from the bed like a wounded mother leopard cornered in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>With her remaining claws, her teeth, and every part of her body, she pounced on Shin Yuan with all her might, wanting to perish together with him. However, with her power sealed, all her resistance seemed so laughable and powerless in front of Shun Yuan, who was now a mid-stage second realm martial artist. Shin Yuan expressionlessly stretched out one hand and easily grabbed her fair neck. &quot;Let me go.&quot; Natasha&#x27;s legs kicked weakly in the air, and her hands frantically scratched at Shin Yuan&#x27;s arm, but she couldn&#x27;t even leave a white mark. The feeling of suffocation and despair caused the last glimmer of light in her azure eyes to gradually dim.</p>
<p>Inside the observation room on the giant light screen, Lean&#x27;s cheeks felt a little hot. A him, there seems to be some new development on Angelina&#x27;s end. I&#x27;ll go check it out. She simply couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. He made up a lame excuse and fled the observation room as if he were escaping.</p>
<p>Leaving the space to Su Ching Zu and Ling, Su Chingu watched with great interest. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses and her hands flew across the screen, constantly updating the data curves representing Natasha&#x27;s physical and mental state. &quot;Interesting, so interesting,&quot; she murmured to herself, staring at the screen. Behind her glasses, her eyes gleamed with the fervent excitement of a scientist discovering a new continent. With her heart rate at 180 and adrenaline surging, despite the extreme humiliation and pain, her mental defenses not only didn&#x27;t collapse, but instead showed a very subtle weakening.</p>
<p>Was this her body&#x27;s instinct to actively give up resistance in order to survive? Furthermore, Shin Yuan&#x27;s energy fluctuations exhibited a peculiar resonance phenomenon. The dragon energy was actively repairing and transforming his body, an unprecedented miracle of life. Her unreserved, even somewhat explicit scientific analysis made Longing, who was standing next to her, blush and feel extremely uncomfortable. Longing stared intently at the wooden dummy in the center of the training field, as if she wanted to glare two holes through it. Yuguang couldn&#x27;t help but glance at the screen again and again.</p>
<p>abnormal. Longing turned her head away and refused to look at the screen again. She didn&#x27;t know whether her pervert was directed at Su Chingu, who was making flirtatious remarks with a straight face, or at Shin Yuan, who was undergoing arduous training. Perhaps it&#x27;s both. Over the next few days, this special training session became Shun Yuan&#x27;s daily routine.</p>
<p>Every day, he would arrive at this special cell on time for 3 to four hours of intense training. After training, he would be immediately dragged to the training room by Longing for even more brutal extra training until he had no strength left. They were then thrown into Su Chingu&#x27;s speciallymade medicinal baths, each one more potent than the last, to repair their bodies while simultaneously consuming the flesh and blood of highlevel star beasts cooked by top chefs to replenish their energy. This hellish cycle would be enough to drive any martial artist to a mental breakdown. But for Shin Yuan, it was a bittersweet experience because the effect is just so damn significant.</p>
<p>With the combined blessing of his overpowered talent of becoming stronger through training and the divine skill of nourishing with dragon energy, his strength is skyrocketing at an alarming rate. Training ended that day. Shinuan soaked in the bathtub feeling refreshed and habitually opened the system panel. Host Shinuan realm second realm warrior midterm. Chi and blood 4,800 to601.</p>
<p>Talent one, guaranteed success, rank F. Talent two, get stronger through training, rank F. Completed lucky target, Lin Churin, rank A. Targets in the strategy, Longing, SS rank, 76% affection. Su Chinghu, Srank, 75% research interest.</p>
<p>Natasha, a rank 50% affection. Looking at the blood and chi value that was about to break through, Shin Yuan felt a surge of pride. He&#x27;s just one step away from breaking through to the late stage of the second realm. This visible improvement filled him with endless motivation and anticipation for his daily training. Just as he was filled with excitement, the door to the observation room was pushed open.</p>
<p>Su Chingu walked and carrying a latest data report. She looked at Shun Yuan who was sitting comfortably in the bathtub. How does it feel? My super soldier feels great. Shiny Yuan grinned, patting his increasingly muscular chest. He felt like he could kill a land dragon with a single punch.</p>
<p>Is that so? Suching walked up to him and handed him the report in her hand. Then take a look at this. Shinuan took the report with a puzzled look, and after just one glance, he was stunned. That was a detailed analysis report on Natasha&#x27;s psychological and physiological state. The report ended with a bolded conclusion that nearly made his eyes pop out of their sockets.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The target has shown mild symptoms of Stockholm syndrome and has developed both physiological and psychological dependence on the abuser. Shinuan body submission monitoring 80% dependence obedience. What? 80% submission rate. Shinyuan was completely dumbfounded when he saw the number. Shouldn&#x27;t it be a negative number? Why is it increasing instead of decreasing? Could this woman also be a hidden masochist? Seeing his horrified expression, Su Ching Xu pushed up her glasses, revealing a glint of wisdom in her eyes behind the lenses.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you surprised?&quot; she spoke calmly, revealing the secret of heaven in a single sentence. &quot;When a person&#x27;s dignity and will are completely destroyed, leaving only the most primitive physiological instincts. The person who can satisfy her instincts and grant her a moment of peace will become her only god.&quot; Stockholm syndrome. Perhaps a more amused smile curled at the corners of Su Ching Xus lips. Or perhaps her gaze fell on Shun Yuan, her eyes seeming to see right through him inside and out.</p>
<p>It was your magical dragon energy that subtly changed her body and her heart. Perhaps your talent comes with some kind of charismatic aura that we can&#x27;t understand. Chapter 44. Natasha&#x27;s heart returns. Dragon Chi creates fortune.</p>
<p>Three more days passed. Natasha in the interrogation room had completely changed. She stopped resisting, stopped cursing, and even stopped crying. Rationally, she hated this man to the core, wishing she could eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. But instinct is screaming wildly at me.</p>
<p>Her spirit is being torn apart and reassembled little by little amidst this intense contradiction and division. And her will, the once indestructible will of a top agent, was worn down to almost nothing by the day-to-day training. Only that mouth remained, retaining its last laughable stubbornness. The heat is almost done. Shinyuan looked at the system panel and saw that Natasha&#x27;s submission level had quietly climbed to 80.</p>
<p>Obedience, and he understood. The final moment to win hearts and minds has arrived. On this day, when Shin Yuan pushed open the interrogation room door again, he did not start the painful training session as usual. He pulled up a chair, sat down on the bed, and then turned on the huge screen on the wall of the interrogation room. The screen lights up.</p>
<p>The scene that appeared was from another interrogation room. In the scene, Angelina is firmly fixed to a cold metal laboratory table, her limbs locked in alloy shackles, unable to move. Her face was filled with terror and despair. Beside her, Su Chinghu, dressed in a pristine white coat and wearing sterile gloves, slowly and methodically picked up an instrument that looked like an electric drill, but whose tip was covered with densely packed fine needles from a cart filled with various strangely shaped surgical instruments that gleamed with a cold light. &quot;Miss Angelina, don&#x27;t be nervous.&quot; Su Ching Xhus voice came through the screen, still as gentle and intellectual as ever, but to Angelina, it was more terrifying than the devil&#x27;s whispers.</p>
<p>This is our company&#x27;s latest neural dissection probe. Such Ching Zu smiled and waved the probe covered with fine needles in front of Angelina&#x27;s eyes. It could precisely peel away every memory nerve without damaging your cerebral cortex. Of course, the process might be a little painful. But don&#x27;t worry, your body has been genetically modified, giving you far greater vitality than the average person, enough to support us in completing at least 300 experiments.</p>
<p>We will let you watch your memories being extracted one by one while you are in a state of endless lucidity. Suching voice seemed to possess a kind of magic. She didn&#x27;t use torture or coercion. She simply explained the upcoming experimental procedure to Angelina in a tone that stated scientific facts. But that absolute disregard for life, that madness of treating her, a living person, as experimental material is more capable of destroying a person&#x27;s will than any form of torture.</p>
<p>No, I don&#x27;t need to say anything. I&#x27;ll tell you everything. On the screen, the Ace Viper, who was defiant and clamoring to make the Dragon Sea Empire pay the price just a second ago, had his psychological defenses collapsed the moment he saw Su Chingu activate the neuronal stripping probe. She screamed like a mad woman, tears streaming down her face, shouting out everything she knew about the plan, the hidden spy network, and the Federation&#x27;s follow-up deployments like beans spilling from a bamboo tube. Natasha, watching her former comrade and rival make such a fool of themselves on the screen, felt a chill run from the soles of her feet to the top of her head, as if the blood in her body was about to freeze.</p>
<p>Fear. An unprecedented fear gripped her heart like a giant thorny hand. Just then, Shinuan&#x27;s voice rang softly in her ear. Did you see that? Shinuan stood up, walked step by step to her, and lifted her face. Now, I&#x27;m giving you one last chance.</p>
<p>Option one, become my woman. Forget your past. Forget your mission. And from now on, all you need to do is please me. In return, you will enjoy a life of comfort and luxury you never dared to dream of before.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t touch any of your sisters or your foolish cousin. Their fate is to be sent to Dr. Seab and become her new toys. Option two. He pointed to the screen where Angelina, who had been injected with sedatives due to a mental breakdown, was being dragged away like a rag doll.</p>
<p>Like her, she was sent to Dr. Sue&#x27;s laboratory. Believe me, Shinuan&#x27;s voice was filled with cruel malice. She&#x27;s more interested in your body, which has undergone deep genetic modification by Black Widow, than in me. She has a thousand ways to make you scream out all your secrets in endless lucidity and agony, then turn you into a body that can never speak, but can still breathe and shed tears.</p>
<p>You can choose for yourself.&quot; After saying that, Shinuan released her hand, sat back down in his chair, and looked at her leisurely, waiting for her answer. A deafly silence fell over the cell. Natasha trembled violently, her teeth chattering. &quot;Choose! Is this what you call a choice! On one hand, they betrayed their organization and their beliefs, becoming utterly play things of the enemy. On the other side lies a hell on earth, a place 10,000 times more terrifying than death.</p>
<p>Loyalty, glory, dignity. These things which she had been instilled with since childhood and for which she had fought for half her life seemed so ridiculous and so vulnerable in the face of Su Ching Xus eyes which shone with a mad light and in the face of her extreme fear of becoming an experimental subject. Her mind was flooded with images of the brutal and bloody training she had undergone since childhood, the cold-blooded and ruthless faces of the organization&#x27;s higher-ups. And then she looked at Angelina&#x27;s desparing numb eyes on the screen. She discovered that the faith she had fought for, even at the cost of everything seemed utterly unworthy of her journey to that hell on earth.</p>
<p>Is it worth it? It&#x27;s not worth it. The moment this thought popped into her mind, her beliefs crumbled. Tears silently streamed down her once vibrant blue eyes. A long time. Natasha looked at the man not far away who was staring at her coldly with a scrutinizing gaze.</p>
<p>The stubbornness, hatred, and madness in her eyes had all vanished without a trace. At this moment, she didn&#x27;t say anything. She struggled to her feet from the cold ground. The expression on his face was even more resolute than when he first joined the Federal Secret Service. Chapter 45.</p>
<p>Natasha&#x27;s tier five blood enhancement potion. This psychological battle, which lasted for several days, has finally come to an end. He won to win completely. That night, when Shin Yuan entered the room again, a series of system notifications suddenly rang in his mind, making his heart skip a beat. Ding! It has been detected that the host and target have completed the 100th time.</p>
<p>The talent guarantee mechanism has been triggered. Ding! A genetic defect, permanently deprived of good fortune, has been detected in the target Natasha. The Dragon Chi nourishing function has been automatically activated to begin repair. In gene repair, 10%, 50%, and 99% are involved. Ding.</p>
<p>Gene repair complete. Target Natasha&#x27;s luck ability has returned to normal. Ding. Talent effect triggered. Congratulations, host.</p>
<p>Good luck. Ding. Target Natasha. Original score 95. Score plus two after repairing the damaged luck gene.</p>
<p>Host attraction type score plus one. Current overall score 98. Has reached 90% conquest value. Congratulations, host, for successfully conquering the enemy nation&#x27;s special agent goddess. Ding, ding, ding.</p>
<p>Massive rewards are being settled. A series of system notification sounds like the most beautiful symphony instantly blanked Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind, leaving only endless ecstasy. It&#x27;s done. It really worked. My frank skill, which guarantees a perfect shot, can actually defy fate.</p>
<p>Even Black Widow, who has undergone deep genetic modification and whose records indicate permanent bad luck, can have her condition forcibly repaired and be given good luck. This is  not F-level talent. This is clearly a Guanian Bodhis Sutva who grants children descending to Earth, taking on the role of matchmaker god again. Personal reward plus 10,000 HP automatically absorbed 1/5if of Natasha&#x27;s maximum HP. Personal reward.</p>
<p>One bottle each of tier one to five health boosting potions. Effect unconditionally increases the maximum health of a martial artist of the corresponding tier by one/10enth. Potion recipes are unlocked and can be mass-produced. 10,000 points ofqi and blood. A series of potions that can dramatically increase the strength of all low and mid-level martial artists in the company.</p>
<p>Shinuan felt his blood burning. His blood energy, which had already reached the mid-stage of the second realm martial artist, surged through the bottleneck like a flood breaking through a dam after being infused with 10,000 points of blood energy. Ding, your chi and blood value has exceeded 6,000. Congratulations, host, on successfully advancing to the late stage of the second realm martial artist. Ding, your chi and blood value has exceeded 10,000.</p>
<p>Congratulations, host. Boom. A shock wave with a radius of nearly 10 meters erupted from Shun Yuan center. The entire interrogation room hummed under the impact of this shock wave. Ding.</p>
<p>Your chi and blood value has exceeded 15,000. Congratulations host on successfully advancing to the third realm marshall master. Three realms. In just one night, he jumped from the middle stage of the second realm to two minor realms. directly stepping into the third realm of martial arts master, which is the dream of ordinary martial artists.</p>
<p>Moreover, his foundation is incredibly solid, and his chi and blood are far more abundant than those of other martial artists of the same level. Who would believe such a rocket-like upgrade speed? Shinuan lowered his head and looked at the stunning beauty in his arms, his eyes becoming incredibly complex. pity perhaps a little, but more than anything, it&#x27;s the thrill of a conqueror and a possessiveness towards his woman. He leaned down and gently kissed her smooth forehead. From today onwards, you are no longer Black Widow.</p>
<p>You are Natasha, my woman, Shin Yuans woman. Half an hour later, at the headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, in the highest command center in the conference room, Ziao Jingwa and Leans hands trembled slightly as they looked at the list of spy networks that Natasha had written herself, a list that was over 10 pages long and so detailed it was appalling. Good lad, good lad. Ziao Jingo was so excited that his face turned red. He slapped Shin Yuan&#x27;s shoulder hard, so hard that he almost stumbled.</p>
<p>Without shedding a drop of blood, the Federation&#x27;s top agent spilled all his secrets. Your skills in picking up girls, I mean, in interrogation, are better than the two of us old guys combined. Lean also looked at Shin Yuan with approval and satisfaction. The more she looked at him, the more pleased she became. Upon hearing this, Shinuan simply smiled calmly.</p>
<p>He picked up the teacup on the table, took a small sip, and then corrected him in a nonchalant tone. &quot;Brother Xiao, you&#x27;ve got it wrong. She&#x27;s no longer a secret agent.&quot; He paused, put down his teacup, and then under the astonished gazes of the two men, uttered a startling statement. She is pregnant. From this moment forward, she is my wife, Shin Yuans wife.</p>
<p>Huff dash. Ziao Jingua spat out the mouthful of hot tea he had just taken a sip of, turning it into a cloud of steam that accurately smeared Li Yans face across from him. Li Yun didn&#x27;t even bother to wipe the tea off her face. She and Zhiao Jingua were frozen in place, their mouths agape, as if they had been put under a spell. Is this some kind of medical miracle or some kind of mystical phenomenon? Seeing the two men&#x27;s expressions of utter disbelief, Shin Yuan chuckled inwardly and then directly shared the reward panel for theqi and blood enhancement potion with them.</p>
<p>when Xiao Jinga and Le Yun clearly saw the rows of potion effects radiating golden light. Tier one health enhancement potion can unconditionally increase the maximum health of a first level martial artist by 10%. Second tier chi and blood enhancement potion can unconditionally increase the maximumqi and blood of a second realm martial artist by 10%. Tier five health enhancement potion can unconditionally increase the maximum health of a grandmaster of the fifth realm by 10%. The two powerful figures from the protective umbrella company who were used to all sorts of storms and wielded immense influence held their breath for a moment.</p>
<p>The next second, the two of them simultaneously swore in a tone filled with shock and ecstasy. What? What? Especially that fifth tier grandmaster enhancement potion. If those old patriarchs of the Umbrella Corporation knew about it, they would probably worship Shin Yuan on the spot. The entire Umbrella Corporation base was turned upside down by this earthshattering news. The highest level red alert in the command center suddenly blared shrilly throughout the room.</p>
<p>A communications soldier stumbled in his face ashen and his voice trembling. Report: top secret encrypted communication. Chintata, an elderly gentleman, has already taken off aboard the Kuan Pong fighter jet. He also left a message. Ziao Jing was heart tightened and he hurriedly asked, &quot;What did you say?&quot; Chapter 46.</p>
<p>ElderQin Returns. With 25,000 points ofQi and blood, the Kuong fighter jet represents the pinnacle of technology in the Langai Empire. It is made entirely of a rare metal called void dark gold, which can ignore the detection of most radars and has the terrifying ability to perform spatial warp at three times the speed of sound. Normally, even the highest level mobilizations rarely involve this prestigious instrument. But now, it&#x27;s rushing here at full speed for one person.</p>
<p>When the futuristic black fighter jet silently hovered over the helellipad of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, the entire base went on high alert. Ziao Jingua and Le Yun along with all the company&#x27;s senior martial artists were already lined up on the tarmac waiting for them. The hatch opened. Old Sheen, dressed in a simple Jong Sean suit, slowly walked down, still holding his everpresent purple clay teacup. His face betrayed no emotion, and his cloudy eyes were as calm as a bottomless ancient well.</p>
<p>But everyone knows that beneath this calm lies a terrifying undercurrent. Old Sheen, Xiao, Jingua, and Li Yun immediately stepped forward and saluted in unison. Old Sheen simply nodded, his gaze passing over them and landing directly on Shun Yuan at the very back of the crowd. He didn&#x27;t say anything. He just waved to Shun Yuan.</p>
<p>Shinuans heart skipped a beat, but he stealed himself and went up to her. Old Sheen looked him up and down, his seemingly cloudy eyes seeing right through him. After a long pause, Old Sheen finally spoke slowly. The three realms martial master is quite good. Just six words, yet they made the eyes of the company tycoons around them almost pop out.</p>
<p>A martial arts master of the third realm. Did they hear me right? Wasn&#x27;t this young man just an ordinary person who hadn&#x27;t even reached the threshold of martial arts apprentice? just over half a month ago. How long has it been? He&#x27;s already a third realm martial artist. Ignoring the shock of the crowd, ElderQin patted Shin Yuan on the shoulder and then turned to look at Su Ching Xu. What about the medicine? Su Ching Zu immediately stepped forward and handed a silver metal briefcase to Old Chin.</p>
<p>Based on the formula provided by Shin Yuan, I have successfully synthesized samples ofQi and blood enhancement potions from tier 1 to tier 5. Her voice carried a hint of barely suppressed excitement. I have completed preliminary animal experiments with the third tier drug and the results have completely exceeded my expectations. Oh, a glint of light flashed in old Chin&#x27;s eyes. Tell me about it.</p>
<p>I conducted the experiment using a tier 2 peak armored warbbor. Suing Xu adjusted her glasses and announced a set of data that left everyone breathless. After the injection, its blood and chi levels surged by a full 10% in just 10 minutes. And there were no side effects whatsoever. Most importantly, its gene sequence has also undergone some kind of benign mutation which has forcibly raised its future growth ceiling.</p>
<p>His dash, a collective gasp of astonishment rippled through the crowd. No side effects permanently increases the maximum amount of chi and blood by 1/10enth. It can also enhance future growth potential. What does this mean? Okay, great. A smile of immense satisfaction immediately appeared on old cheen&#x27;s wrinkled face.</p>
<p>This thing is more valuable than 100 S-rank talents. He turned his head and looked intently at Shinuan. Now only the last step remains. All eyes were once again focused on Shin Yuan. He was the creator of this miraculous drug and also the most suitable, perhaps even the only test subject.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan looked at the red potion on the table, which shone with an alluring luster and felt a surge of excitement in his heart. This is a fantastic item that can unconditionally increase the maximum health of a third realm martial artist by 1/10enth. His current chi and blood value is 15,000. After drinking this bottle of medicine, it will increase by another 10,000. Why wouldn&#x27;t you take advantage of such a free opportunity? I&#x27;ll do it.</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, Shin Yuan picked up the third tier chi and blood enhancement potion, unscrewed the cap, and was about to pour it into his mouth, etc. Su Ching Xu suddenly spoke up to stop him. She walked up to Shin Yuan, took the medicine from his hand, and then took out a brand new syringe filled with a pale golden liquid from her briefcase. Oral absorption is too slow, and there is energy loss. Such looked at Shin Yuan and gave him a kind smile.</p>
<p>To ensure the absolute accuracy of the experimental data, we will use the old method, introvenous injection. Shiny Yuan stared at the syringe in her hand, which was thicker than his own finger, and his expression froze. &quot;What? Another injection? Is this woman addicted to injections?&quot; He looked at Elder Sheen for help, hoping that this powerful rogue cultivator could step in and uphold justice. However, old Sheen just chuckled, held his teacup, blew on the steam, and acted as if I couldn&#x27;t see anything. Ziao Jingua and Li Yun turned their heads to the side, pretending to study the map on the wall.</p>
<p>Even the usually aloof long ing seemed to subtly twitch the corners of her mouth and a hint of shot in Freuda flashed in her icy phoenix eyes. It&#x27;s over. Not a single one of them is a good person. Shinyuan felt that his life was bleak. What are you scared? Su Chingu shook the syringe in her hand, her eyes behind her glasses flashing with a cunning light.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, this medicine is very mild. I guarantee it won&#x27;t hurt. I don&#x27;t believe you. Shin Yuan mentally complained. But looking at Su Ching Xus unquestionable professional expression, he knew he was destined to get that injection again today.</p>
<p>Bring it on. Shin Yuan stealed his heart, closed his eyes, and voluntarily stretched out his arm, looking like he was bravely going to his execution for the sake of having no purpose. The cold needle pierced the skin. A gentle infusion of the medicine. Huh.</p>
<p>Shinyuan was taken aback. It really doesn&#x27;t hurt. Moreover, a warm and powerful energy flowed through his entire body along his meridians. The feeling was like soaking in a top-notch hot spring with every cell cheering and jumping for joy. That feels so good.</p>
<p>That feels so good. Just as he closed his eyes, enjoying this comfort, the system panel in his mind started flashing wildly again. Ding. Detected that the host is absorbing high purity chi and blood energy. Ding.</p>
<p>The passive ability to become stronger through training has been triggered. Ding. Health and mana increased by 1,000 plus 2,000 plus 3,000. Boom. Hisqi and blood value skyrocketed at a rocketlike speed.</p>
<p>16,000 18,000 20,000 25,000. In the end, hisqi and blood value steadily stopped at 25,500. With just one injection, hisqi and blood surged by 10,000 points. I&#x27;m less than 5,000 points away from breaking through to the mid-stage of the third realm marshall master. It was a success.</p>
<p>Suching looked at the data curve on the light screen generated by her talent, which had once again risen vertically and even broken through the upper limit of the chart, and exclaimed excitedly. The chi and blood value is 25,500 points. Moreover, the foundation is solid, and there are no side effects. The effects of this medicine are almost exactly as we predicted. That&#x27;s great, huh? Old Chin was the first to react, bursting into deafening laughter.</p>
<p>Xiao Jingua and Li Yun also snapped out of their shock. They looked at each other and saw boundless ecstasy in each other&#x27;s eyes. Longing, standing in the corner, was more shocked than anyone else. Looking at the man bathed in golden light, exuding unparalleled confidence and doineering aura, her long frozen heart began to pound uncontrollably. This man has truly created another miracle.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan grinned from ear to ear as he listened to the continuous notification sounds in his mind. Just as the entire laboratory was immersed in immense joy and awe, the smile on Old Chen&#x27;s face faded. Chapter 47. Longing unleashes her full potential and dedicates herself. Trouble? Shinyuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>He was now the darling of the Umbrella Corporation with plenty of manpower and resources. And with the invincible rogue cultivator Chin Lao and the Umbrella Corporation as his two powerful backers, what trouble could he possibly have? Old Shin didn&#x27;t answer directly, but simply waved his hand, signaling everyone to sit down. His cloudy gaze swept over everyone present, finally settling on Shin Yuan. Do you know why our Dragon Sea Empire was able to rise from the ruins of the Great Cataclysm in just a few hundred years and become the dominant power on Earth? Standing alongside the Free Federation and the Starbeast Empire, Old Sheen&#x27;s voice became distant and deep, carrying a sense of historical weight. Everyone present, except for Shauna Yuan, who was still somewhat dazed, subconsciously straightened their backs and looked solemn.</p>
<p>Aside from that, your majesty, it&#x27;s because we have the exquisite war goddess and us old guys holding things up in front, ElderQ said slowly. But more importantly, it is because our dragon empire has the most complete and fair system for selecting and training martial artists in the entire human territory. Whether you are a scion of a wealthy family or an ordinary citizen from a remote planet, as long as you have talent and are willing to work hard, the Empire will provide you with the best resources and give you the opportunity to stand on a higher stage in the universe. The core of this system is the Imperial Prodigy Battle, which is held every 3 years. The Battle of the Prodigies.</p>
<p>Shinuan raised his eyebrows slightly when he first heard this name. That&#x27;s right. Xiao Jingwa picked up the conversation, a hint of longing and reminiscence appearing on his rugged face. It was the grandest event for all young martial artists under the age of 30 in the entire empire and even the entire human realm. It was the only battlefield for a carp to leap over the dragon gate.</p>
<p>Lie Yun added softly. You could say that including your uncle Xiao and me and even elder back then, we all fought our way up from the heavenly pride battle. Without a heavenly pride battle resume, you&#x27;ll never be able to enter the innermost circle. Shinuan understood instantly. Isn&#x27;t this just an imperial version of the college entrance examination combined with the imperial examination system? Except it doesn&#x27;t test your writing skills, but rather your actual combat ability.</p>
<p>Elder Chen, do you mean that Shun Yuan looking at ElderQ already has a guess in his mind? The new Imperial Prodigy tournament will be held on the Imperial Capital Star in less than a month. Old Sheen nodded. his deep eyes fixed on him, then changed the subject, his tone becoming extremely solemn. When I brought you back, her majesty the queen gave me a secret order, which I will now relay to you verbatim. Shinuan, there are two paths ahead.</p>
<p>The choice is yours. Firstly, staying on Earth means having a protective umbrella and my protection, which can ensure your lifelong peace and wealth, but you will never have the chance to set foot in the starry sky again and see a wider world. Secondly, participate in the battle of the prodigies. Use your fist to earn a place of fame throughout the empire and seize a ticket to the Milky Way. It is a more dazzling but also more dangerous stage.</p>
<p>The choice is yours. If you choose comfort, I will not force you. But from now on, her majesty the queen will no longer pay attention to someone who is content with mediocrity. Old Chin&#x27;s voice echoed in the secret room. Each word striking Shin Yuans heart.</p>
<p>The entire secret room was completely silent. All eyes were on Shin Yuan, waiting for his choice. Shinuan&#x27;s mind went blank. The Empress has abandoned him. What&#x27;s the difference between this and removing the strongest protective umbrella over his head? He instinctively wanted to refuse.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me? Going to fight to the death with all the geniuses in the universe? He had finally earned the means to live a peaceful life with money, a house, and women. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to stay on Earth and be a landlord? But a thought popped into my head. My own system. The goal is to conquer those. On this blue planet, there are already so many stunning beauties like Chin Shu, Ling, Su Ching Xu, and Lin Sharon.</p>
<p>What about the entire Milky Way? What would the ratings be for those legendary elven saints, celestial fox princesses, icy female CEOs who control interstellar conglomerates, and even young female empresses who rule a civilization? To spend one&#x27;s entire life holed up in the newbie village of Earth, guarding one&#x27;s own little patch of land. Is this what you call lying flat? That&#x27;s called being spineless. True complacency means having the power to do whatever you want anytime, anywhere. He&#x27;s the kind of person that makes all the goddesses in the universe cry out for good luck. Go.</p>
<p>We absolutely have to go. If he doesn&#x27;t go, the empress will abandon him. At that point, he might not even be able to keep anything he is now, let alone win over the goddess. The thought of those landscapes that only exist in legends made Shin Yuan feel his blood boiling. A true man is born between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>How can he remain subservient to others for long? We absolutely have to go have some fun. Old Shin, I understand. Shin Yuan took a deep breath, suppressing his excitement, and his eyes blazed with an unprecedented intensity. I&#x27;ll participate in this battle of geniuses. However, he changed the subject, revealing his signature sly smile and rubbed his hands together in front of old Chen.</p>
<p>Participation is fine, but this mission is a bit too difficult. Those prodigies are all incredibly arrogant, and my strength is only at the early stage of the third realm. Compared to those top geniuses who easily possess S-level or SS level talents, my status is a bit lacking. He began to openly haggle. You have to give me something good, right? Otherwise, how am I supposed to make a name for myself in the heavenly pride battle? How about giving me a few more injections of something like a chi and blood enhancement potion? or I think my body can handle that dragon blood essence.</p>
<p>I can try it again. Get lost. Before old Chin could speak, Su Chingu, who was standing next to him, couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. She glared at Shinuan with annoyance, and her charm made Shinuans heart itch again. Do you think dragon blood essence is as cheap as cabbage? A single drop of that stuff is enough to cause a fourth realm marshall grandmaster to go berserk.</p>
<p>You want a whole vial? Are you out of your mind? Haha. Old Sheen was amused by him and burst into laughter, pointing at Shun Yuan and jokingly scolding him. You&#x27;re such a child, you really don&#x27;t want to suffer even the slightest loss. Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll have plenty of medicine. Before you set off for the capital, Shingu will do everything in her power to help you reach a new level.</p>
<p>But having a high level of understanding is not enough. Old Sheen turned his head and looked at Ling, who had been silent all along. Longing, little girl, exist. From this day forward, you set aside all other tasks. Your sole mission is to teach this child without reservation all your combat skills, including your dragon soul battle body.</p>
<p>Within the next month, he was about to teach his most treasured dragon soul battle body to this scoundrel who had taken advantage of him countless times. A complex mix of emotions welled up inside her, and her fingers, gripping the seam of her trousers, tightened unconsciously. Ding. Detected a significant emotional fluctuation in target longing. Affection level plus 1%.</p>
<p>Current affection level 84%. Shin Yuan was overjoyed when he heard the notification in his mind. I deliberately moved closer. Instructor Long, I&#x27;ll be relying on your guidance from now on. Longing glared fiercely at Shun Yuan, wishing she could kick him away on the spot.</p>
<p>Chapter 48. The virtuous wife&#x27;s confession. The first rays of morning sunlight streamed through the enormous floor toseeiling windows of Fortress 1, casting long streaks of light across the luxurious bed. Shinyuan opened his eyes, feeling relaxed and full of energy. He looked down and found himself embracing a stunningly beautiful woman with a sweet sleeping face.</p>
<p>Lynch curled up in his arms like a docel cat. The continuous nourishment from the dragon&#x27;s energy during this period made her look like a piece of jade that had been polished a new radiating a lustrous glow. Her already fair skin was now so tender it seemed you could pinch water from it with a healthy pink hue. Her bare face without any makeup was more captivating than any heavily madeup face Shinuan had ever seen. What&#x27;s most deadly is her already outrageous figure.</p>
<p>Whether it was the secondary development of the dragon&#x27;s energy or a normal reaction during pregnancy, her perfect curves became even more astonishing, filling out the silk slip dress to its fullest and outlining an arc that could drive any man crazy. Shinuan&#x27;s Adams Applebed. This is the ultimate joy of nurturing a character. Looking at her peaceful and beautiful sleeping face, Shin Yuan&#x27;s groggginess from just waking up vanished instantly, replaced by a mischievous glint in his eyes. He carefully approached Lynn Sharon&#x27;s jade-like earlobe.</p>
<p>He lowered his voice and breathed hot air into her ear in a husky magnetic tone. Honey, wake up. It&#x27;s time for your morning exercise. The warm touch and the breath near her ear made Lin Char&#x27;s eyelashes tremble slightly. She groggy opened her still wet eyes and saw the handsome face with a mischievous grin right in front of her.</p>
<p>H. Her face flushed instantly, and she instinctively tried to push away his mischievous hand, but her body was too weak to exert any strength. She could only give him a symbolic pat on his firm chest, her voice soft and sweet with a nasal tone from just waking up. &quot;Stop joking, it&#x27;s not even dawn yet. It&#x27;s perfect that it&#x27;s still dark.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be convenient for us to do some naughty things.&quot; Shin Yuans laughter grew even more wicked, and he became increasingly unrestrained, prompting the girl to let out a soft murmur. &quot;You&#x27;re so mean,&quot; Lin Sharon protested softly. But her clear eyes were filled with unyielding love and dependence. This complete trust pleased Shin Yuan greatly. He pinched her delicate chin and asked deliberately, &quot;Honey, I&#x27;m going to the capital in a month to participate in the heavenly pride battle.</p>
<p>There might be a bunch of girls even prettier than you crying and begging to have my babies. Aren&#x27;t you jealous? He had expected to see the girl acting cute, either pouting or pouting. Unexpectedly, Lin Charuns shyness disappeared after hearing these words. She suddenly reached out and carefully cupped Shin Yuans face in her hands. Those clear eyes, which always carried a hint of unease and mist, were now incredibly bright and earnest, as if trying to penetrate the deepest part of his soul.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care how many women you have in the future. My only concern is your safety. The opponents in the heavenly pride battle must be incredibly strong, right? You must be careful. She paused, her eyes slightly reening, but she stubbornly held back. Go ahead and do what you want to do.</p>
<p>I will take good care of our home. My baby and I will always be here waiting for you to come back. These words were like a powerful warm current, instantly washing away all the joking and playfulness in Shin Yuans heart. He was completely stunned. A tremendous sense of emotion, satisfaction, and an unprecedented sense of responsibility welled up from the deepest part of his heart.</p>
<p>What defines a perfect wife? That&#x27;s it. This is a blessing that must have taken 10 lifetimes to earn. He could no longer control his emotions and pulled the girl in front of him into his arms tightly, as if he wanted to meld her into his very bones. Rest assured, Shin Yuan rested his chin on her shoulder, his voice slightly with excitement, yet incredibly solemn. for you all.</p>
<p>I will become the strongest man in the world. This sudden warmth and the increasingly beautiful and alluring body of the girl in his arms was like a spark thrown into a gasoline can. Chu ran, &quot;You are now an A-level talent martial artist, and your physique is different from before.&quot; He began to use sweet words to seduce her, but the sky hasn&#x27;t yet. Shinuan didn&#x27;t give her a chance to refuse. Just as he was preparing to take the next step and fully enjoy this blessing he had accumulated over 10 lifetimes.</p>
<p>Bang. A deafening explosion. The heavy door of fortress number one made of special alloy and touted as having soundproofing comparable to a bank vault was kicked open from the outside by an incredibly powerful force. A tall imposing figure in a black tight-fitting combat suit strode in exuding a chilling aura. It&#x27;s longing.</p>
<p>She was clearly getting impatient and was ready to personally drag that lazy bum to training, but she never dreamed that when she kicked open the door, she would see such a disgusting scene. The air seemed to freeze in that instant. Shin Yuan froze in midair, his expression turning to astonishment, then extreme displeasure. He slowly turned his head inch by inch to look at the doorway. Lin Sharon let out a short scream.</p>
<p>In the next second, she buried her face in the pillow, wishing she could disappear from the world on the spot. Longing standing at the door was completely petrified. The icy murderous expression on her face when she kicked the door was still frozen on her expression, but her cold phoenix eyes were wide open, clearly reflecting this absurd scene. 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds. A visible blush suddenly rose from her fair neck, quickly spreading to her ears and finally across her entire pretty face.</p>
<p>For the first time, a look of utter disorientation appeared on her perpetually icy face. In deathly silence, Shinuan looked at Longing, whose face was so red it was almost bleeding. Yet, she was still in the position of kicking the door open. He silently pulled up the blanket and covered Lin Char and himself. Then he cleared his throat and broke the extremely awkward silence in an extremely natural tone.</p>
<p>Good morning, Instructor Long. Do you want it? Chapter 49. The iceberg instructor&#x27;s heart is in turmoil. Continue. You continue.</p>
<p>Long Yings voice was tight and she was practically fleeing in panic. Her turning around was so hasty that she looked rather disheveled, completely lacking her usual sassiness and composure. Bang! She slammed the door shut with all her might. The loud noise making the door panel tremble. The world has finally returned to peace.</p>
<p>Inside the room, Shinuan looked at the still humming alloy door, then looked down at Lin Sharon in his arms, who had buried her face in the pillow and was so embarrassed she looked like she was about to spontaneously combust. He couldn&#x27;t help but laugh and cry at the same time. In the corridor, Longing leaned against the cold wall, her heart pounding wildly, as if it would burst out of her chest at any moment. My cheeks were burning hot, and I was breathing rapidly. Her mind was like a laggy film, uncontrollably replaying the scene over and over again.</p>
<p>She shook her head vigorously, trying to shake the thought out of her mind, but it was no use. She suddenly realized that today&#x27;s close training would probably be incredibly agonizing and bizarre. The thought of having some minor physical contact with that scoundrel later on. That bastard. Faced with this sudden awkward situation, Shiny Yuan was also at a loss.</p>
<p>Looking at Lin Sharon, trembling in his arms like an ostrich, the interrupted rage in his heart not only did not die out, but burned even more fiercely. Although Long Yings intrusion was a bit of a downer, &quot;Who is Shiny Yuan? He&#x27;s accompanied tycoon with a skin thicker than a city wall.&quot; He yanked up the silky blanket, muttering to himself, &quot;Ignore her. Let&#x27;s keep doing our thing.&quot; After saying that, before Lin Char could protest, he completely enveloped the two of them in this small space that belonged only to them. Longing leaned against the cold wall, the blush on her face still lingering. Her body stiffened abruptly and her ears involuntarily perked up.</p>
<p>&quot;That bastard.&quot; Longing felt her cheeks burning as if she had been slapped hard several times by an invisible hand. &quot;She can&#x27;tt leave.&quot; And so, the youngest grand martial arts master of the Umbrella Corporation, one of the Empires top female geniuses, stood outside Shin Yuan&#x27;s room for a full hour, her pretty face flushed like a child who had done something wrong. This one hour was more agonizing for her than fighting a fifth tier star beast for three days and three nights. When the door clicked open again, Long Ying stood up almost reflexively, her eyes darting around in a panic, completely avoiding eye contact with the person who came out. Shinuan came out of the room and looked at L Yings adorable, restless, and evasive appearance, and he was overjoyed.</p>
<p>You dare interrupted my good time. should. He deliberately cleared his throat, walked up to Ling, and said in an extremely irritating tone. Instructor Long, have you been waiting long? I&#x27;m sorry. I was just exchanging ideas with Chu Ran, which took a little longer.</p>
<p>Ly Yings pretty face instantly turned cold again. She glared at Shun Yuan fiercely and squeezed out a few words through gritted teeth. Let&#x27;s go to the training room. The atmosphere inside the huge training ground was unusually awkward. Ly Yings instructions were extremely concise.</p>
<p>Each word sounding as if it had been pulled from an ice cellar, and the icy expression on her face seemed to freeze the air itself. But the blush on the back of her ears, which she couldn&#x27;t hide, completely betrayed her inner turmoil. Push-ups 1,000. 2,000 sit-ups. Squats 3,000.</p>
<p>Longing rattled off a terrifying training regimen that would paralyze any third realm martial artist on the spot. Shin Yuan&#x27;s eyelids twitched as he listened. That woman really went all out. However, he is now a third realm martial artist with a blood and chi value of 25,500. And with his abnormal talent of becoming stronger through training, he is not afraid at all.</p>
<p>No problem, Shinyuan readily agreed. Training begins. It was that familiar agonizing process again. When Lyings perfect jade-like feet, encased in black combat boots, stepped onto the bench again. Her mind was in turmoil.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan chuckled inwardly, but his words betrayed his true intentions. Instructor Long, you seem a bit weak today. Did you skip breakfast? Should I order you some? Shut up. Do your thing. Longing, feeling ashamed and indignant, unconsciously increased the force of her energy under her feet.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan grimaced in pain, but secretly he was overjoyed. He found himself increasingly enjoying watching this icy instructor breakdown. Next, sit-ups. Their faces were inches apart, and they could hear each other&#x27;s breaths. Every time Shin Yuan got up, he could clearly see her long eyelashes trembling slightly and her cheeks flushed with embarrassment and annoyance.</p>
<p>He could even smell the crisp fragrance in her hair, mixed with her unique, faint body scent, like the first clear sky after a snowfall. Instructor, your heart is beating fast. When Shin Yuan stood up again, his lips were almost touching her cheek. He whispered in a voice that only the two of them could hear. &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Longing stiffened for a moment, then turned her head away, not daring to look at him.</p>
<p>She felt her heart, which had been as hard as a rock and had never wavered for any man in more than 20 years, being melted little by little by this rogue bastard, yet fatally attractive man in front of her. Ding. In-epth training underway. Train to get stronger. Talent triggered.</p>
<p>Health plus 10. Plus 10. Plus 10. Ding. Target L Yings mental defenses have been severely shaken.</p>
<p>Icebreaking progress plus 20%. Current progress 70%. Chapter 50. Shin Yuans comprehension. Longing was astonished.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans lips practically stretched to the sky as he listened to the notification in his mind. He deliberately slowed down his situp movements. And with each situp, he brought his cheeks as close as possible to Long Yings blushing face, their noses almost touching. Seeing her long curled eyelashes trembling slightly with nervousness and embarrassment like two startled butterflies. Instructor Long, he lowered his voice, his warm breath brushing against her sensitive earlobe.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re blushing. Are you thinking about this morning? Shut up. Longing jumped away from him like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, feeling utterly ashamed and indignant. She felt like this bastard was driving her crazy. to escape this damned, ambiguous atmosphere as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>She ended the inhumane physical training early and announced in an icy voice, &quot;Physical training is over. Now it&#x27;s time to teach you something serious. Watch closely.&quot; Longing took a deep breath, forcibly calming her turbulent emotions. She walked to the center of the training field, assumed a fighting stance, and her entire aura instantly changed. The martial arts of our dragon sia empire differ from those of the barbarians of the western continent who only know how to pursue pure strength and speed.</p>
<p>We place greater emphasis on the exquisite use of vital energy. Today I will teach you the five forms of military path, a method of using vital energy that our company developed specifically for advanced martial artists. The moment she finished speaking, Long Yings aura changed abruptly. Her already tall and straight figure seemed to transform into an invincible divine weapon at this moment, and her skin shone with a faint metallic luster. First move, steel body.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, a hidden compartment in the training room wall slid open, and an automatically locked Gaus sniper rifle emerged, its cold muzzle precisely aimed at Long Yings back. Shin Yuan&#x27;s eyelids twitched. Hey, are you going to go this far? Longing ignored him. Bang. A piercing gunshot rang out.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic projectile, powerful enough to pierce a 3cm thick special steel plate, made a crisp ding sound the moment it hit her back. The projectile twisted and deformed, then fell helplessly to the ground, emitting wisps of smoke. There wasn&#x27;t even a white mark left on Lyings back. Shinuan was dumbfounded. What is this guy even human? Taking a sniper rifle shot with his bare body.</p>
<p>The principle behind the steel body is to highly compress vital energy and cover the body&#x27;s surface, forming an invisible armor of vital energy. When mastered to its extreme, it can even withstand the bombardment of tactical level missiles. Longing finished her work, her voice carrying a hint of barely perceptible arrogance. Learn this trick and you won&#x27;t have to hide in fights anymore. Shiny Yuan whistled.</p>
<p>Longing ignored his banter and continued to demonstrate the second move. Second move, tempest kick. She took a sudden step forward as if she were stepping on invisible steps, and her whole body was briefly suspended in midair. Immediately, she delivered a powerful downward kick accompanied by a sharp whistling sound and slammed it hard into the alloy floor below. Boom! A visible white blade of air burst forth from her toes, leaving a terrifying/mark half a foot deep with smooth mirror-like edges on the hard alloy floor.</p>
<p>Walking on air, unleashing vital energy. Do you understand now? Longing turned her head and looked at him. Shiny Yuan swallowed hard and nodded emphatically. He walked to the center of the training field, closed his eyes, and began to recall the energy circulation route that Longing had just used. With the superhuman body control brought by his overpowered talent of becoming stronger through training and the incredibly pure Yuan Chi after being tempered by the dragon soul battle body, Shinuan began to try to imitate it.</p>
<p>He first tried steel bodies. The vital energy surges from the dantion, flows through the meridians throughout the body, and then attempts to compress it on the surface of the skin. This process requires extremely high control over one&#x27;s vital energy. The slightest mistake can lead to loss of control over one&#x27;s vital energy and cause harm to oneself. But this was only Shun Yuan&#x27;s first attempt, and his skin was successfully covered with a thin but real layer of Yuani armor.</p>
<p>He raised his hand and tapped his chest, making a dull thud. Hey, it worked. Then comes the storm kick. He imitated Longing and took a sudden step forward. The vital energy within the body instantly gathers at the soles of the feet and then explodes.</p>
<p>Buzz. His body actually remained suspended in midair for a fraction of a second. Although she almost fell when she landed because she was not skilled at controlling the controls. This scene stunned Longing, who was standing to the side. Her red lips parted slightly and her usually cold and sharp phoenix eyes were filled with shock.</p>
<p>How is this possible? It should be noted that the five forms of military principles is one of the secret manuals of the Umbrella Corporation and even the Empire and its requirements for talent and comprehension are extremely high. Even as an SS level genius, it took her a week just to grasp the basics of the steel body when she first encountered it. As for the highle technique of storm kick, which involves the external release of vital energy, it took a full month of arduous training before one could barely stay in the air for a moment. But in her eyes, this guy was a good for nothing except for those two unreasonable F-level talents. He actually mastered the basics of both moves in just over 10 minutes after watching his own demonstration only once.</p>
<p>Is this guy even human? This is beyond what genius can explain. This is a monster. It&#x27;s a demon. Looking at Shun Yuan&#x27;s face, which was beaming with excitement at his success, she felt a sense of admiration for him for the first time. This man may truly deserve to stand in a higher place.</p>
<p>Training is over. When Shin Yuan was once again exhausted and collapsed on the ground like a dead dog, Long Yings usually icy face was once again flushed with two beautiful blushes. She took a deep breath, as if she had made some incredibly difficult decision. Walking up to Shin Yuan and looking down at him, Longing spoke in an extremely unnatural, even trembling tone. There&#x27;s one last training session.</p>
<p>Oh. Shin Yuan was so tired he didn&#x27;t even bother to lift his eyelids. Instructor, are you really going to drain me dry? Come with me to the medicine bath house. Longing avoided his gaze and turned her back to him. This is related to the secret of my dragon soul battle body, and it was specifically explained to me.</p>
<p>Her hesitant and embarrassed expression, as if she wanted to speak but dared not, instantly piqu Shin Yuan&#x27;s curiosity to its peak. Chapter 51. Dragon Soul as a guide. Cultivation. Inside the high-tech medicinal bath house, the familiar molten crimson liquid still churned like lava.</p>
<p>Shinyuan is no longer so afraid of this thing. He&#x27;s even a little excited about it now. After all, every time I finish soaking in it, I feel like I&#x27;ve been reborn. It&#x27;s so refreshing. He effortlessly took off his sweat- soaked training clothes, leaving him in only shorts and was about to step into the bathtub, etc.</p>
<p>A very soft, slightly trembling voice came from the side. Shinuan turned his head in confusion and saw Longing standing motionless by the bathtub with her back to him. Her voice was so low it was like a mosquito&#x27;s hum. If Shin Yuan hadn&#x27;t had amazing hearing, he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to hear what she was saying at all. Take off that, too.</p>
<p>Huh? Shin Yuan was stunned on the spot, picked at his ears, and wondered if he had misheard to get rid of your naked body. What&#x27;s wrong with this female warrior today? Has she changed her personality, or did her morning exercise give her some strange inspiration? He subconsciously looked at Longing and found that although she had her back to him, her tightly clenched fists and her ears that were so red they looked like they were about to bleed revealed her extreme inner turmoil. Just then, the laboratory door was pushed open. Such Ching Zu walked in gracefully, wearing her signature red high heels and carrying her precious instrument case, ready to record today&#x27;s experimental data. As soon as she entered, she saw this bizarre scene.</p>
<p>A female warrior, her face flushed, her back turned, too ashamed to turn around. A shirtless dragon with a bewildered and confused expression. A gleam of light unique to onlookers flashed in Su Ching Xus eyes, hidden behind her gold rimmed glasses. before she could even open her mouth to gossip. Longing forced herself to remain calm and in an extremely curt tone, ordered her to leave.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Sue, please go out first. It is not convenient for outsiders to be present during the upcoming training sessions.&quot; Oh. Su Ching Xus gaze swept back and forth between the blushing longing and the astonished Shun Yuan several times. Instead of leaving, she walked in with great interest.</p>
<p>She walked around the two of them as if assessing some precious experimental subject and finally stopped behind Longing, reaching out her finger to poke her stiff back. Instructor Long, your heart rate is over 30% of your resting rate and your muscles are under high tension. What kind of high energy secret training are you about to conduct? Should we clear the area? L Yings body stiffened further, and she gritted her teeth, remaining silent. Seeing that she didn&#x27;t answer, Su Chingu walked up to Shin Yuan with a smile, looked him up and down, and her eyes were bold and direct. Our young master is something else.</p>
<p>He quietly won over our company&#x27;s ice queen. Impressive. Impressive. I support you. Shinuan was stunned.</p>
<p>Take it down. When did I take it down? Suing Xu longing finally couldn&#x27;t hold back and shouted out her full name in shame and indignation. Such Ching Xu didn&#x27;t give her a chance to explain at all and continued in that experienced tone, leaning close to Shun Yuans ear and offering a friendly reminder. Sister, let me give you a heads up. Longing has an SS level talent, and her physical strength far surpasses that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>It might hurt a little the first time, but don&#x27;t worry. This medicinal bath can improve blood circulation, relax muscles, and relieve the tension and pain of the first time. You&#x27;d better be gentle. Don&#x27;t damage our precious little darling in the war zone or you&#x27;ll cause him psychological trauma and that won&#x27;t be good to deal with. After saying that, she winked at Shun Yuan, then stomped away in her high heels, humming an unknown tune without looking back.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll come back to get the data later. You guys take your time. All that&#x27;s left is a silhouette that seems to say good luck. First time, Shinuan&#x27;s mind went blank for a moment, and the instant he heard the word, he completely misunderstood it. He turned his head and looked at Longing.</p>
<p>She stood there biting her lower lip tightly, her pretty face flushed red, filled with shame, embarrassment, and a hint of acquiescence. She didn&#x27;t even argue. What? Shin Yuan felt his heart was about to jump out of his throat. Happiness came so suddenly. Could it be that Elder Chin&#x27;s order to impart all combat skills and the dragon soul battle body to this child without reservation has taken effect? or has this iceberg been completely conquered by my slip of the hand and my shameless behavior these past few days? Who cares? Since it&#x27;s a freebie, why not take it? Shinyuan felt as if he were in a dream.</p>
<p>He quickly and neatly took off his clothes. Then, with a splash, he excitedly jumped into the scalding hot medicinal bath. The next second, something even more shocking happened. Under the gaze of his wide, staring eyes. Longing took a deep breath, her upright chest rising and falling slightly as if she had used up all her strength.</p>
<p>Then she slowly raised her hand, her fingertips trembling slightly, and touched the zipper of her black, tight-fitting combat suit. Tsk the sound of the zipper being slowly pulled open was particularly clear and alluring in the steamy medicinal bath. This is neither the voluuptuousness of Su Ching Zhu that makes one&#x27;s blood boil, nor the innocent yet alluring naivity of Lin Sharon. This is a perfect fusion of strength and grace, like a Valkyrie descended from the battlefield, every inch of her skin speaking of power and discipline. Shinuan felt his nose getting hot and his mouth and throat dry.</p>
<p>Longing took long strides, her movements somewhat stiff, and stepped into the bathtub. Hiss. The scalding hot liquid instantly enveloped her fair skin, causing her to let out a suppressed groan, her body stiffening taut. She lowered her head, almost curling up into a ball, wishing she could bury her face in the water. &quot;Close your eyes!&quot; With her eyes tightly shut and her voice trembling uncontrollably, she began to explain this unbelievable situation.</p>
<p>&quot;My Dragon Soul Battle Body is the company&#x27;s top tier SS level talent. Its core ability besides greatly enhancing its own combat power also includes a secret that can only be shared with one&#x27;s closest person. That is to purify and strengthen the vital energy of both sides through the purest in and yang energies. This fusion must be achieved by having the palms facing each other guiding the vital energy to complete a full cycle. At this point, her voice was barely audible.</p>
<p>This is the only way to make your strength undergo a qualitative change in a short period of time. Chapter 52. The iceberg instructor is going to kick my face again. I see. Shinuan then suddenly realized what was going on.</p>
<p>So, it turns out it wasn&#x27;t a case of forcing someone to do something, although I was a tiny bit disappointed. Longing slowly raised her delicate hands, which trembled slightly with nervousness and shyness, and reached them towards Shun Yuan through the rising steam. Give me the handle. then you are not allowed to open your eyes. Absolutely not allowed to open your eyes.</p>
<p>If you dare to peek at me, I&#x27;ll stomp your eyes out with my boots during the next training session. Faced with this extremely fierce yet utterly endearing warning and the vibrant, alluring scene before him that could drive any man mad, Shin Yuan felt like he was about to lose his mind. Stomp on a dog&#x27;s eye. I couldn&#x27;t ask for this. That&#x27;s a shortcut to boosting favorability.</p>
<p>But now there are clearly more important things to do. He suppressed a laugh. put on an extremely serious expression and extended his hand. The moment their palms gently touched in the scalding hot medicine, boom. An indescribable, strange feeling, like two completely different high voltage currents instantly spread throughout their bodies.</p>
<p>Ly Yings already flushed face turned an alluring pink, even the base of her neck. Her vital energy was cold and doineering, yet it was like striking a scorching volcano. The burning blood energy from Shun Yuans body mixed with the blood of a dragon. She quickly closed her eyes, not daring to look at Shin Yuan again, and began to guide the pale golden energy within her body, according to the secret technique of the dragon soul battle body. A cool energy flowed slowly into Shun Yuan&#x27;s body through their clasped palms.</p>
<p>Guard your mind, guide it. Ly Yings clear, cold voice, tinged with anxiety, exploded in his mind. Shin Yuan dared not delay and immediately began to frantically circulate the vital energy within his body, following the method she had previously taught him in an attempt to guide and integrate this doineering golden energy. This is an incredibly painful yet incredibly mysterious process. Shiny Yuan felt his vital energy being thrown into a furnace at a temperature of 10,000 degrees C from an ordinary piece of pig iron and being repeatedly forged and tempered by the golden dragon&#x27;s soul power.</p>
<p>Well, a sharp pain shot through him, and Shin Yuan couldn&#x27;t help but groan, veins bulging on his forehead. His vitality in the face of this external force was like inferior clay being crushed and reshaped time and time again. Fool, don&#x27;t fight it with brute force. Go with its flow. L Yings urgent voice rang out.</p>
<p>Treat it as a part of yourself. Shin Yuan gritted his teeth, gave up resisting, and began to try to accept it. Something amazing happened. When he stopped resisting, the golden dragon soul power also became much gentler. It&#x27;s like a master blacksmith using the most precise force to hammer away and peel away the impurities from his mixed energy bit by bit.</p>
<p>The structure has been reorganized and the quality is undergoing a tremendous transformation. Although the total quantity has not increased, the quality has improved by more than one level. If his previous vitality was like ordinary tap water, then now it is a high concentration energy liquid that has undergone layers of filtration and purification. At this moment, his control over vital energy also instantly reached a whole new level. Ding.</p>
<p>Host is detected to be undergoing ultra high intensity elemental training. Ding. Training to become stronger has been triggered. Energy control plus one. Plus one plus one.</p>
<p>Ding. Target L Yings mental defenses have been severely shaken. Icebreaking progress plus 20%. Current progress 90%. Just as Shun Yuan was immersed in the thrill of his rapidly increasing strength, a cycle of energy circulation ended and the golden energy within Lyings body flowed back, taking away a trace of the scorching blood and chi from Shun Yuans body.</p>
<p>An unprecedented warmth rose from Long Yings dantion, bringing a surge of warmth to her limbs and bones, which had been slightly cold due to years of practicing ice type techniques. Her face turned even redder. Shinuan&#x27;s dragon blood had an unimaginable beneficial effect on her ice type physique and even made her feel that the bottleneck in her cultivation realm which had not been loosened for a long time had a slight crack. One more time. Longing gritted her teeth, her voice barely audible.</p>
<p>Okay. Shen Yuan&#x27;s spirits lifted and he unhesitatingly activated his chi and blood once again. The second time, the third time, the two gradually entered a mysterious state of resonance. Under the tempering of the dragon soul power, Shun Yuan&#x27;s vital energy became increasingly pure and refined. While Longing, nourished by Shun Yuan&#x27;s doineering subdragon blood, felt that her dragon soul battle body was undergoing some kind of miraculous transformation.</p>
<p>The medicinal liquid in the bathtub became clear at a speed visible to the naked eye, and all the essence was swallowed by the two of them. After an unknown amount of time, the last trace of the medicine was absorbed. When the golden torrent of energy finally completed a full cycle within his body, and returned to Lyings body, Shin Yuan slowly opened his eyes. He felt like a completely different person. He raised his hand, looked at his palm, and a thought struck him.</p>
<p>A wisp of primordial energy, originally milky white, slowly emerged. But at this moment, that wisp of primordial energy was mixed with a faint yet incomparably noble golden color. He opened his eyes and met Long Yings phoenix eyes, which were also just opening and misty with tears. Their eyes met in the rising white steam. Shinuans gaze gradually became somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>His aggressive gaze lingered on her exquisitely beautiful face, flushed with a captivating blush from the vibrant energy within, and he blatantly admired her beauty. longing instantly caught his malicious gaze. Her face suddenly became even hotter than the medicine had been poured on her. I was filled with shame and indignation. That bastard.</p>
<p>We agreed. No peeking. How dare he? Almost instinctively, she raised her long, straight, beautiful leg in the water and kicked it hard at Shin Yuans face with a sharp whooshing sound. Oh no, I&#x27;m going to get kicked in the face again. Shin Yuan felt a surge of joy.</p>
<p>He recalled the systems special physical contact notification after he was kicked in the face last time and the surge in his favorability rating. This time with such a huge advantage. This kick to the face is an opportunity we absolutely cannot miss. He stealed himself, resigned himself to his fate, closed his eyes, and prepared to take the kick, which was full of love. Chapter 53.</p>
<p>Icebreaking progress. 90% The iceberg has escaped. However, the expected pain did not come. Splash! A crisp, rapid splash. Shinuan opened his eyes in confusion.</p>
<p>The scene before him left him completely dumbfounded. Using the movement of lifting her leg, Longing nimblely flipped over and leaped directly out of the bathtub. Glistening water droplets slid down her almost perfect body curves. But she didn&#x27;t care at all. Barefoot on the cold floor, she moved frantically like a startled cat, frantically grabbing her clothes, combat uniform, underwear, military boots.</p>
<p>She grabbed whatever was available and put it on, almost putting her bra on backwards because she was so flustered. In her disheveled state, she had lost all her icy warlike demeanor and looked more like a young wife caught in the act of adultery. In the end, she didn&#x27;t even have time to put on her military boots properly. She just grabbed them and rushed out of the medicine bath house. Bang! The door was slammed shut.</p>
<p>Ding! Strategy progress increased by 2%. Current progress 92%. Hearing the notification in his mind, Shin Yuan stood blankly in the bathtub, staring at the tightly closed door. An uncontrollable lust suddenly surged from deep within his lower abdomen and rushed straight to his head. A surge in power, an ultimate visual impact.</p>
<p>The iceberg god of war fled in embarrassment. All of this caused his blood and energy to boil completely. He needs to vent immediately right now. Lynn Churin, no. She just finished her morning exercise and is pregnant.</p>
<p>Her health is precious. Longing even worse, they just ran away. Although their favorability rating is high, they are clearly not mentally prepared yet. If we chase after her now, she might really beat us to death. Who else can we turn to? In an instant, another alluring and beautiful face with exotic charm appeared in Shun Yuans mind.</p>
<p>Natasha, that enemy spy whom she sent to hell with her own hands and whom she rescued with her own hands. Her submission rate has reached 90% and I just personally got her pregnant, giving her a new life from being a defective product deemed useless by the Federation. Right now, she probably both respects and fears me, loves me and hates me at the same time, which is the best time to manipulate her. A wicked smile curled at the corner of Shun Yuan&#x27;s mouth. He not only had to satisfy his own needs, but more importantly, he had to personally tell that pitiful yet hateful female spy a message that would make her ecstatic and completely submit to him.</p>
<p>She quickly got out of the bathtub, dried herself, and got dressed. Before leaving, he saw the pair of black military boots that Longing had left on the ground. He whistled, picked up the military boots that still carried the warmth and faint fragrance of their owner, and stroed towards the special guarded area deep within the base. The headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation has three underground floors, forming a special ward. The environment here is completely different from the prison cell Natasha had imagined.</p>
<p>Instead of cold iron bars and damp walls, there was a top tier suite that was even more luxurious than the one she had stayed in on the top floor of the Phantom Bar. soft leather sofas, a holographic starry sky dome, and even a walk-in closet filled with the latest luxury brand clothing. Every day, a doctor comes to examine her, and two young and beautiful nurses take care of her daily life 24 hours a day. The food delivered was all made with the finest star beast flesh and blood and rare medicinal herbs, constantly nourishing her body that had been damaged by the backlash of her spiritual power. This treatment, comparable to that of an imperial princess, made Natasha feel uneasy and confused.</p>
<p>What exactly is this protective umbrella company and this man who has caused her so much humiliation up to? Just as she was looking at the canary cage with a puzzled expression, click. The door was pushed open from the outside. The man she both hated and feared, yet whom she couldn&#x27;t help but think of uncontrollably in the dead of night, walked in. He was still dressed in simple casual clothes, but his doineering aura was even stronger than before. Upon seeing him, Natasha&#x27;s heart clenched and she instinctively clenched her fists.</p>
<p>Mr. Shan. When the two nurses who were preparing dinner for Natasha saw Shin Yuan, they immediately stopped what they were doing and bowed respectfully. Shiny Yuan waved to them. You&#x27;ve worked hard.</p>
<p>You can go home now. Yes. The two nurses dared not say anything more and immediately prepared to leave. But before leaving, one of the nurses, who looked a little younger and was also quite bold, couldn&#x27;t help but offer a word of advice. Mr.</p>
<p>Shan, we have just conducted a full physical examination on Miss Natasha. Her body is still very fragile, especially, &quot;Get to the point.&quot; Shinyuan&#x27;s tone was somewhat impatient. The nurse trembled slightly at his words and quickly lowered her voice, speaking in a worried tone. Her genes seem to have just been repaired by your dragon energy, and our test results show that she seems to have had some good luck. So, it&#x27;s best not to engage in too much intense training during this period.</p>
<p>These words struck Natasha like a thunderbolt. She froze on the spot. Gene repaired, &quot;Good luck.&quot; She was no longer the useless person deemed defective by the Federation, used as a disposable tool by the organization, and destined never to have her own child. This miracle, which she never dared to dream of. This wish that she thought she could never realize in her lifetime, actually happened.</p>
<p>She thought of the cold stars and ridicule she had suffered since childhood in the Black Widow training camp because of this defect. She thought of how the high-ranking officials of the Federation treated her like a heartless, disposable weapon, sending her to carry out this perilous mission. And now she has been given a new lease on life. An indescribable, overwhelming joy instantly overwhelmed all her reason, defenses, hatred, and humiliation. No, Shin Yuan, however, seemed oblivious to Natasha&#x27;s distraught appearance, waving his hand dismissively and urging her on.</p>
<p>You should leave quickly. Chapter 54. Natasha&#x27;s 100% submission. Bang! The door was closed. The two of them were left alone in the entire luxurious suite.</p>
<p>Natasha finally recovered from the enormous shock. She looked at the man before her, whose usually weary and hateful blue eyes were now filled with a complex mix of ecstasy, confusion, and humble hope. In a trembling, almost incoherent voice, she asked cautiously, &quot;Was what she just said true?&quot; Shinuan did not answer immediately. He reached out and pinched her small, delicate chin, forcing her to look him in the eye. A wicked yet doineering smile graced his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, how could it be fake when I planted it myself? Congratulations, Natasha. From this day forward, you are no longer a defective product of the Federation. You have been reborn and become a true woman and mother. These words were like the most precise key, completely unlocking the last shackle in Natasha&#x27;s heart. It also completely shattered her so-called dignity and pride as a top agent.</p>
<p>She thought of the cold stairs and ridicule she suffered in the Black Widow training camp since childhood because of this defect and how the Federation High Command treated her as a heartless disposable weapon, sending her to carry out this mission with a slim chance of survival. The man before her was a devil who had destroyed all her faith. But at the same time, it was also a god who gave her a new life, turning her from a flawed product back into a complete woman. Tears could no longer be held back and streamed down her face from her bright blue eyes. But this time, it was no longer tears of humiliation and pain.</p>
<p>Instead, they were tears of ecstasy, gratitude, and utter liberation. Ding. Target Natasha&#x27;s submission level plus 10%. Current submission level 100%. Ding.</p>
<p>The target has completely submitted, unlocking the special bond of loyalty mark, absolute loyalty, never betrayal. Shun Yuan smiled inwardly, a strong and exciting sense of conquest surging within him. From this moment on, the Black Widow, who once struck fear into the hearts of countless enemies, will become his most loyal and deadliest weapon, belonging solely to him. However, she soon discovered in despair that faced with Shun Yuan&#x27;s powerful physique, which had been enhanced by both dragon blood and dragon soul, making him comparable to a third realm calamity level star beast. The next morning, when Shin Yuan walked out of Natasha&#x27;s cell feeling refreshed, he felt as if he had been elevated.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stretched, his joints cracking loudly, his face showing the satisfaction of a full meal. He hummed a little tune and swaggered into the training room with an air of nonulence. Yesterday, I was interrupted by that little vixen long in kicking down the door, and today she ran away again. I haven&#x27;t settled this score yet. I just finished reviewing my lessons last night.</p>
<p>However, the scene he saw when he pushed open the door to the training room stunned him. Longing was standing alone, quietly in the center of the training field. A lielike humanoid target formed from primordial energy floated in front of her. With her eyes closed, she seemed to blend into her surroundings, radiating an ethereal yet dangerous aura. Suddenly, she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Those usually cold and sharp phoenix eyes were now burning with two golden flames that seemed to be real. Dragon soul battle body activate with a low cold shout. On the surface of her black tight- fitting combat suit, fine golden patterns resembling dragon scales appeared. At that moment, her entire demeanor underwent a dramatic transformation. No longer the cold female instructor, but a noble, majestic, and powerful humanoid dragon that emerged from ancient mythology.</p>
<p>The five styles of military tactics combined into one. Dragon Fong Break. He rushed to the human-shaped target in a few steps. Her right index and middle fingers came together, transforming into an indestructible sword with golden dragon&#x27;s soul power condensing at the fingertips. She pointed with her finger.</p>
<p>The humanoid target formed from highdensity primordial energy and capable of withstanding a full force attack from a third realm martial artist was punctured like a balloon by her fingertips silently dissipating into the most primitive energy particles and vanishing into the air. Shinyuan stood at the door, his mouth agape, unable to close it for a long time. What is this? Lyings true strength? Is this the true secret of the SS level talent? Dragon soul battle body. That&#x27;s terrifying. Shinyuan had no doubt that even if he activated his steel body, he would be pierced through on the spot and left with nothing but ashes by that finger strike.</p>
<p>It turns out that all her so-called practical guidance and extra training were just a bunch of child&#x27;s play. She didn&#x27;t even use one 10,000th of her strength. A wave of fear accompanied by an even stronger desire to conquer surged wildly from the depths of his heart. Glug. Shinuan felt himself starting to have impulsive thoughts again, and he couldn&#x27;t wait for her to reach 100% icebreaking progress.</p>
<p>Have you seen enough? Longing finished her training, and the golden dragon scale patterns on her body slowly disappeared along with the powerful dragon might. She turned around and looked at the shocked man at the door, her pretty face seeming even colder. But if you look closely, you can see that there is still a faint blush on her fair neck, caused by excessive circulation of vital energy. Ding. detected that target Long Yings emotions are severely fluctuating due to yesterday&#x27;s and the host&#x27;s shameless behavior.</p>
<p>Ice-breaking progress plus 2% current progress 94%. Shin Yuan was overjoyed when he heard the notification sound. He didn&#x27;t restrain himself. Instead, he became even more unrestrained, sizing up Long Yings impeccably alluring figure before finally speaking with a grin. I&#x27;ve seen enough of it, and I&#x27;m starting to get a little hooked.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, that move was so cool. Teach me. Chapter 55. Longing is angry. Su Ching Xu enters.</p>
<p>Snort. Longing snorted coldly, her icy phoenix eyes sweeping over him as if examining a stained weapon, making no attempt to hide her disdain. Judging from your appearance, you must have been busy again last night. Her voice was like an ice needle, precisely piercing Shin Yuans most sensitive nerve. Shin Yuans old face immediately turned red.</p>
<p>That woman definitely did it on purpose. Instructor Long, what are you saying? Shin Yuan immediately straightened his back. L Yings lips curled into a mocking smile. I see you&#x27;re enjoying yourself. She walked step by step to Shun Yuan.</p>
<p>The two of them very close. He could even smell the cool fragrance of pine forest after a snowfall on her. Don&#x27;t think I don&#x27;t know what filthy things you&#x27;re thinking. Shiny Yuans heart skipped a beat. No way.</p>
<p>This woman can really read minds. Your little thoughts are written all over your face. Long Yings voice was even lower. still icy cold. Stop with your unrealistic fantasies.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no way you&#x27;d make me like that woman. These words were like a bucket of ice water poured over his head, instantly extinguishing the small flame that had just ignited in Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart. But what followed was an even stronger, completely ignited competitive spirit. Not qualified? I&#x27;ll show you what it means to be qualified. Training begins.</p>
<p>Longing seemed too lazy to waste any more words with him and turned to walk towards the center of the training field. Today&#x27;s training content is completely different from the past. There were no push-ups, no sit-ups, and no squats. Only sparring, a pure, unadulterated clash of energies. Use the five military techniques you just learned to attack.</p>
<p>Long Yuan stood still, beckoning to Shin Yuan with his finger. His calm and collected demeanor clearly showed that he had absolute confidence in his own strength. Instructor Long, you said it yourself. Shin Yuans eyes burned with fierce fighting spirit. He wanted to show this woman who looked down on him that he wasn&#x27;t a spineless coward who could only lord it over others in that area.</p>
<p>Steel body. Shiny Yuan let out a low shout, and the Yuani in his body circulated wildly, covering his entire body with a layer of Yuani armor mixed with light gold. He took a sudden step forward. Storm kick. His figure hovered briefly in midair before unleashing a powerful downward kick accompanied by a sharp whooshing sound aimed fiercely at Long Yings head.</p>
<p>Faced with his blow that was powerful enough to shatter a steel plate. Longing simply raised her right hand casually. Then with two slender fair fingers, she lightly pinched Shin Yuans unstoppable ankle. Bang! An overwhelming force surged forth. Shin Yuan felt as if he had kicked a piece of ice that had never melted for thousands of years.</p>
<p>and all his power was instantly dissolved without a trace. Ly Yings two seemingly delicate fingers were like two indestructible iron clamps, locking his ankles tightly and making him unable to move. His strength is decent, but his speed is too slow, and his use of vital energy is a complete mess. Longing raised her head and looked at the man who was hanging in midair by her with one hand, his face filled with shock and horror. She spoke in a tone as if she were commenting on a greenhorn.</p>
<p>humiliation. This is a blatant humiliation. Shin Yuan&#x27;s face turned a deep liver color. He gritted his teeth and his other leg drew a tricky arc in the air, kicking towards Long Yings temple. This was the only way he could think of to get out of the predicament.</p>
<p>However, Long Ying reacted even faster than him. She tightened her grip on Shun Yuan&#x27;s ankle slightly with her fingers. A dash. Shin Yuan felt as if his ankle bones were about to be crushed. A piercing pain shot through him, causing him to let out a scream.</p>
<p>His other leg attack was thus deformed, landing limply in empty space. Immediately afterwards, Longing flicked her wrist. Shinuan was violently thrown out of midair by her. Boom! His body slammed heavily against the protective wall in the distance, then slid to the ground. He felt as if his internal organs had shifted, and a sweet taste rose in his throat, almost causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood on the spot.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s try again. Longing stood still, still with that calm and composed demeanor. Shin Yuan struggled to get up from the ground, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and stared intently at her with his eyes burning with golden flames. He admitted that he had underestimated the woman&#x27;s abilities, but he would never admit defeat. Roar! Shin Yuan charged forward again.</p>
<p>Bang! Boom! H! For the next hour, the training room was filled only with the muffled thuds of Shun Yuan being knocked away again and again, getting back up again and again, and his defiant roars. He was like an unkillable cockroach. No matter how fancy or tricky Long Yings moves were, he would charge back up again in the next second. Long Ying looked at the man who was covered in wounds and looked disheveled, but whose eyes were growing brighter and brighter. This man, his indomitable spirit and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>Damn, it&#x27;s kind of charming. Ding. Target long Yings icebreaking progress plus 2%. Current icebreaking progress 96%. It&#x27;s gone up again.</p>
<p>The moment Shin Yuan was kicked away, he heard a notification sound in his mind. Surprisingly, my shameless way of asking for a beating actually increased my progress by 2%. Just as he was preparing to press on and continued to conquer this iceberg with his tenacity. That&#x27;s enough. Longing suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>She walked up to Shin Yuan, looked at his face, which was covered in bruises, but still wore a smug smile, and her eyes became somewhat complicated. Your practical skills are absolutely terrible. But your body is very resilient. This was the first time she had directly affirmed Shiny Yuan. Although this approach is somewhat strange, Shinuan chuckled, just about to say something.</p>
<p>Bang. The training room door was pushed open from the outside once again. Such walked in gracefully, wearing red high heels and carrying a silver metal briefcase. As soon as she entered, she saw the horrific scene in the room, especially Shun Yuan&#x27;s face, which was almost turning into a pig&#x27;s head. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses and a playful smile curved her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, instructor Long, you&#x27;re pretty ruthless. This is our company&#x27;s young master. Aren&#x27;t you afraid of hurting him? Who will compensate you then?&quot; Her unabashedly bold and risque words made Long Yings pretty face blush again. I I&#x27;m just training. Ling retorted somewhat hesitantly.</p>
<p>Training? Su Ching Xu walked to Shun Yuans side, extended her slender hand, gloved in white, and gently pressed on the bruises on his body. I think some people have gotten themselves into a rage. She leaned close to Shun Yuans ear, her voice full of teasing. How was it? Wasn&#x27;t it more exciting to get beaten up by that icy beauty than to talk to that female spy? Chapter 56. Dr.</p>
<p>Sue&#x27;s private tutoring. Shinyuan felt like he was right in the center of a massive battleground. On the left is the ice queen who has just suffered a brutal attack on herself and is now blushing and looking away. On the right is a cunning female PhD student who is drawing circles on her chest with her finger while uttering wild and inappropriate words, seemingly eager to stir up trouble. This is probably the scenario that men both yearn for and dread the most, right? Cough, cough.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan coughed twice, trying to break the awkward yet exciting atmosphere. The next second, he did something that left Longing speechless. He grabbed Su Ching Xus soft hand that was wriggling against his chest, pulled it towards him, and then simply lowered his body, burying his head directly into Su Ching Xus chest, which was wrapped in a white coat, but was still breathtaking, and let out an exaggerated howl. Dr. Sue, my dear sister, you have to stand up for me.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan almost burst out laughing. Instructor Long, she&#x27;s taking revenge. She&#x27;s jealous of how I shone brightly last night protecting the Umbrella Corporation, so she&#x27;s treating me so cruy today. Look at my handsome face. She&#x27;s practically turned it into a pig&#x27;s head.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu was takenback by his sudden embrace. And then a mischievous smile flashed in her eyes behind her glasses. Instead of pushing him away, she reached out and patted Shin Yuans back gently, like soothing a kitten while her other hand pinched his firm muscles. Oh, really? She looked up at Longing, who was practically about to explode, her tone full of shot and Freuda. Instructor Long, is what he said true? You really hit hard.</p>
<p>Tsk tsk, you&#x27;re talking nonsense. Longing was filled with shame and indignation. She felt her cheeks burning and wished she could beat the two scoundrels on the ground to a pulp right then and there. When did she get jealous? I&#x27;m not making this up. Shinuan immediately lifted his head from Su Ching Xus embrace and retorted righteously.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re just jealous. Jealous that I experienced the joy of dedicating myself to this company before you did. You longing was so angry at his outrageous remarks that she trembled all over and couldn&#x27;t utter a complete sentence while pointing at him. She found that her composure and rationality were a joke in the face of this utterly shameless man. He always managed to easily break her defenses using the most shameless and brazen methods.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, stop teasing her. You&#x27;re making her almost cry. Such patted Shun Yuan on the shoulder, then took out a syringe filled with a pale green liquid from the metal briefcase behind her. The moment Shin Yuan saw the syringe, which was thicker than his own finger, his anus tightened as he emerged from his erotic revery, and he instinctively tried to back away. Don&#x27;t worry, this time it&#x27;s not from the Dragon Blood series.</p>
<p>Such shook the syringe in her hand and gave a kind smile. This is a supercell activator that I specially formulated for you based on your latest physical data. It can maximize the activity of your cells, giving you superhuman recovery and endurance in your subsequent training. She paused, lowered her voice even further, and whispered in his ear in a seductive tone. &quot;Most importantly, it can also make your dragon energy even more concentrated.</p>
<p>It allows you to sustain longer and achieve better results when performing certain special training sessions.&quot; Shin Yuan&#x27;s ears immediately perked up. He instantly understood the subtext of those words, and his resistance and fear were immediately replaced by intense anticipation and excitement. He secretly glanced at Su Ching Xus intelligent and beautiful face and her extremely voluuptuous curves that even the white coat couldn&#x27;t hide. He immediately felt that the injection wasn&#x27;t for nothing. Ahem Shin Yuan cleared his throat, immediately put on a righteous expression, and stepped forward to offer his arm.</p>
<p>I, Shin Yuan, will absolutely not refuse. The speed at which he changed his expression left Longing, who was standing next to him, completely stunned. Where is this lecher&#x27;s morals? Such Ching Xu nodded in satisfaction and precisely inserted the cold needle into Shun Yuan&#x27;s vein. A cool yet vibrant energy instantly surged from my arm throughout my entire body. He felt his injuries healing rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The blood and energy that had been depleted due to the highintensity training were replenished at this moment. He even felt like he could sprint out right now and run another 10 km. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Such asked while recording the data. This feels great. Shin Yuan stretched his muscles and bones, his joints cracking and popping.</p>
<p>Feeling like he could fight instructor Long for another 300 rounds. Upon hearing this, Lyings pretty face turned cold, she snorted and turned her head to the side. Very good. Su Chingu nodded, then glanced at Ling beside her and announced in an unquestionable tone. Instructor Long, today&#x27;s training is now over.</p>
<p>From this moment on, all the time from now on belongs to me. What? Ling was stunned for a moment. Now we must use every means possible to raise his strength to another level before the battle of geniuses. Such pushed up her glasses, her eyes behind the lenses gleaming with rationality. Your traditional martial arts training, while effective, is too inefficient.</p>
<p>Next, I will provide him with more scientific and efficient private coaching. After saying that, she ignored Ly Yings ugly expression, grabbed the still somewhat dazed Shin Yuan, and headed towards her own private laboratory. Follow me, my experiment. Today, I&#x27;m going to show you what real technology and ruthless skills are all about. Shinuan, what? This guy has fallen.</p>
<p>Chapter 57. Research interest value 89%. Dr. Sue is just one step away. Such private laboratory has a strong sense of cold futuristic technology.</p>
<p>The room was filled with all sorts of sophisticated instruments that Shin Yuan had never seen before, shimmering with a ghostly blue light. Huge transparent pipes were embedded in the walls through which an unknown luminescent liquid flowed. A holographic projection suspended in midair is constantly refreshing a dense stream of data. Su Ching Zhu led Shin Yuan to a huge metal sphere that looked like a space capsule. This is my latest modified hygiene centrifugal training chamber.</p>
<p>She pointed to the metal sphere and in the tone of introducing her proudest work said, &quot;It can instantly simulate a gravity environment up to 10 times stronger and rotate at high speed. Training in this extreme environment can greatly improve your physical coordination, stress resistance, and reaction speed in high-speed combat.&quot; Of course, she quickly changed the subject, a dangerous curve appearing on her red lips. Its material generates an electrostatic field interfering with even the most sophisticated bioelectric sensors. The data error could reach 0.01% which I cannot accept. She reached out her hand seemingly ready to do it herself.</p>
<p>Under Su Ching Xus amused gaze, Shin Yuan stealed his heart, closed his eyes, quickly took off the last piece of clothing on his body, and then rushed into the cold metal sphere with a deathdeying attitude. Su Chingu nodded in satisfaction. She walked to the control panel, her hands moving across it in a blur. Laugh. Countless robotic arms extended from the inner wall of the sphere, attaching various sensors, each shimmering with a faint light, to Shun Yuans body.</p>
<p>From head to toe, nothing was missed. Shin Yuan felt like a lab rat being put on a dissection table, his whole body filled with something cold and not his own. Are you ready? Suching voice came through the built-in communicator, carrying a hint of barely suppressed excitement. It&#x27;s about to begin. Before he could finish speaking, buzz.</p>
<p>The metal sphere gate slowly closed. The entire world was instantly plunged into darkness and deathly silence. Immediately afterwards, a tremendous, terrifying gravity, as if it were squeezing out his internal organs, crashed down. Ugg Shinuan felt as if he were being gripped tightly by an invisible hand, and his bones were groaning under the unbearable pressure. Before he could even adjust to the sudden gravity, the entire sphere began to spin wildly at an alarming speed.</p>
<p>The world is spinning. Nausea, dizziness, suffocation. Countless negative feelings overwhelmed him in an instant. He felt a churning in his stomach and almost vomited on the spot. Adapt to it.</p>
<p>Control it. Suching cold yet calm voice rang out again. Your enemy will not give you any chance to breathe. In a real interstellar battlefield, you will face an environment 10,000 times more brutal than this. Yes, Shin Yuan had almost forgotten that this world was a cruel world filled with blood and fire, death, and war.</p>
<p>Battle of the Prodigies. Those true prodigies are probably honing themselves in an even more brutal way right now. And if one is still indulging in a life of pleasure and complacency, failure and death awaited him. An indomitable fighting spirit erupted from the depths of his heart. He gritted his teeth, forcibly suppressing the various discomforts in his body and began to try to control his body.</p>
<p>In this chaos, he mobilized the pure vital energy within his body, covering his entire body to resist the terrifying gravity and centrifugal force. He opened his eyes, which were burning with golden flames, trying to find a point of balance in this dizzying darkness. Time passed by second by second. Inside the observation room, Such Chingu looked at the screen and saw Shun Yuans face contorted in extreme pain along with the rapidly fluctuating data curves representing the extreme pressure his body was under. There was no pity on her face.</p>
<p>Instead, it was an almost perverse fanatical excitement. Yes, that&#x27;s it. Struggle. Roar. Let me see where your limits really are.</p>
<p>Ding. Research interest in target Sue Chingu increased by 5%. Current progress 89%. Heart rate 192, blood pressure 220 to 150, lactic acid secretion rate 17 times that of an average person. It&#x27;s perfect.</p>
<p>The potential of this body is simply bottomless. Suching fingers flew across the control panel, recording every precious data point. Her eyes behind her glasses shining brightly. Don&#x27;t just resist with brute force. Try to control your vital energy in this environment.</p>
<p>Even if you only manage to condense a trace of it, it will be considered progress. Shun Yuan roared and tried his best to mobilize the vital energy in his dantion. But in this dizzying environment, the normally docel vital energy ran rampant through his meridians like a wild horse, making his already aching body even worse. Puff. A mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Oh, the first attempt resulted in minor internal organ damage. Interesting. Such didn&#x27;t stop. She enthusiastically pulled up a real-time scan of his internal organs and said, &quot;Let me see how long it will take for your supercell activator to repair this level of damage.&quot; &quot;That crazy woman.&quot; Shin yuan cursed inwardly, but his fighting spirit was completely ignited. He recalled Long Yings cold teachings and the requirements of the five forms of military strategy for the exquisite control of vital energy.</p>
<p>The more chaotic things are, the more calm you need to be. He forced himself into a state of emptiness. No longer trying to command the primordial energy, but instead sensing it and guiding it in the direction of centrifugal force. A miracle happened. A wisp of energy mixed with pale gold actually condensed successfully at his fingertips.</p>
<p>Although it was only as thin as a hair and looked precarious, it was definitely there. Ding. Under extreme conditions, the train to be stronger, talent has been triggered. Energy control plus two. Plus two.</p>
<p>Plus two. Ding. Body coordination. Plus one. Plus one.</p>
<p>Plus one. Inside the observation room, Su Chingu stood up from her chair, staring at the tiny energy dot on the screen, her breathing becoming rapid. He succeeded. He actually succeeded. Under 10 times the gravity and a high-speed centrifugal environment of 300 revolutions per minute.</p>
<p>He successfully condensed vital energy on his first attempt. This is unbelievable. Her chest heaved violently and her white coat was about to burst open. A wave of ecstatic joy, like discovering a new continent, swept over her. Chapter 58.</p>
<p>The end of science is theology. Shinyuan felt like a rag that had been thrown into a washing machine and put into spin dry mode. When the door of the high-tech hygiene centrifugal training chamber slowly opened, he practically crawled out using both his hands and feet. Vomit. He lay on the cold alloy floor, dry heaving for a long time.</p>
<p>His stomach churning from the terrifying gravity and centrifugal force. It felt as if every bone in my body had been taken apart and then hap-hazardly put back together, and every muscle was screaming in pain. He felt dizzy and saw stars everywhere. He couldn&#x27;t even distinguish between the ceiling and the floor. Is this something a human being could do? Suing Zhu, that female demon.</p>
<p>He was mentally cursing Su Chinhu when a crisp melodious sound of high heels clicking on the ground came from afar. Shinuan didn&#x27;t need to look up to know who had arrived. Her shapely long legs encased in pure black stockings stopped in front of him. The tips of her bright red high heels almost touching his nose. A sophisticated body scent, a blend of high-end perfume and a faint medicinal aroma wafted into his nostrils.</p>
<p>To him now the smell was no different from a death warrant. Such Ching Zhu gracefully squatted down. This movement caused the hem of her well-tailored white coat to open slightly, and her plump thighs encased in tight black stockings outlined a breathtakingly perfect curve. Especially her large, round, perky buttocks, which became even more prominent as she squatted, formed an arc right next to Shun Yuan&#x27;s line of sight that was enough to make any man&#x27;s blood boil. Shin Yuan&#x27;s eyelids twitched violently.</p>
<p>This woman is definitely doing this on purpose. She knows what she can see from this angle. Is it pretty? Suching voice carried a hint of calmness and curiosity unique to researchers. She extended her slender fingers clad in white medical gloves and gently touched Shun Yuan&#x27;s temple, feeling his disordered pulse. She even deliberately adjusted her posture to give the view of the scenery an even wider perspective.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be nervous. This is also part of the data collection to observe your hormone secretion levels when you are under extreme conditions and facing stimulation from the opposite sex. Shinuan nearly spat out a mouthful of blood. This is supposed to be data collection. The data displayed on the light screen showed that after 10 minutes of extreme rotation at 10 times the gravity, your cell activity had increased by 3% compared to before you entered.</p>
<p>Your body is adapting to and absorbing external pressure at an unimaginable speed. Her eyes were like those of someone admiring a unique work of art that she had personally crafted, filled with undisguised fervor and a thirst for research. What a perfect experimental subject. This praise sent chills down Shin Yuan&#x27;s spine. He has no desire to be some kind of damn experimental subject.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth and forced himself to sit up, not wanting to show weakness in front of this female demon. He feared that if he showed weakness, the woman would torment him even more. It&#x27;s all right, just a little dizzy. Shinyuan&#x27;s voice was weak. He felt like his tongue was still tied in knots.</p>
<p>Dizziness is a normal physiological reaction, indicating that your body is undergoing self-regulation. Such beautiful eyes behind her glasses lit up instantly. The light even more dazzling than the shadowless lamps in the laboratory. She clapped her hands excitedly, and the crisp sound made Shun Yuan&#x27;s heart tremble. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Since you feel okay, it proves that your body is fully capable of withstanding higher levels of stimulation. We&#x27;ll move on to our next project immediately. The neural overload resonance device. That&#x27;s my masterpiece. It can directly stimulate your cerebral cortex and nerve endings through high frequency and infrasound waves, allowing your mental strength to increase several times over in a short period of time without damaging your body.</p>
<p>This will be of immense benefit to you in the upcoming battle of the prodigies. a neural overload resonance device. Just hearing the name made Shin Yuan feel like his brain was throbbing. He almost choked and fainted on the spot. I was just being polite.</p>
<p>You actually took it seriously. Is there anything else in this woman&#x27;s mind besides experimental data? Dr. Suzu, I think we should call it a day. Everything should be done step by step, and we should balance work and rest, right? Shin Yuan forced a smile that looked more like a grimace, trying to fight for some human rights. No way.</p>
<p>Such Ching Zu refused outright, her smile both gentle and cruel. She didn&#x27;t give Shinuan a chance to refuse at all. She reached out and grabbed his arm, trying to drag him up from the ground. The most important thing in an experiment is continuity. Once interrupted, all the previously collected data becomes useless.</p>
<p>Come on, let me help you up. Her voluuptuous and alluring body pressed against him without any restraint. Even through a thin layer of casual clothing, Shin Yuan could clearly sense the power of that G-level human nuclear weapon. And there was that immense sense of oppression that almost enveloped his entire being. The tip of my nose was filled with her intellectual yet slightly dangerous body fragrance.</p>
<p>This feeling both terrified him and damnably excited him. Just as Shin Yuan was being dragged along by her, staggering and half-heartedly being pulled into another hell. Bang! The heavy alloy door of the laboratory was pushed open from the outside. A voice cold and devoid of any warmth rang out like heavenly music. Dr.</p>
<p>Su, it&#x27;s time for his medicinal bath. You must strictly adhere to the training plan I personally devised. It&#x27;s Longing. Shinuan turned around abruptly and saw Longing standing at the door, dressed in a black, tight-fitting combat suit, arms crossed and expressionless. Her sharp phoenix eyes were fixed on Su Ching Xus hand that was still gripping Shin Yuans arm.</p>
<p>The coldness in her eyes almost freezing the air. My savior, my family. At this moment, Shin Yuan had never felt that Ly Yings icy face was so kind and so adorable. Chapter 59. The confrontation of ice and fire.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Longing appear, Su Chingu stopped what she was doing. She slowly turned her head, the professional smile on her face not disappearing, but the temperature in her eyes dropped to freezing. She gently pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses on the bridge of her nose with her slender index finger. Her tone so flat it betrayed no emotion. Instructor Long, I hope you understand that the most important thing in scientific experiments is the continuity and completeness of data.</p>
<p>Your sudden intrusion has ruined all my hard work this morning. All I know is that his body needs to recover, not be drained dry by these cold machines of yours. Longing didn&#x27;t give an inch, striding into the laboratory with her long legs. The powerful, fierce aura of a martial artist clashed silently with Su Ching Xus intellectual aura in the air. Su Ching Zhu chuckled softly as if she had heard something amusing.</p>
<p>Her laughter filled with undisguised sarcasm. Instructor Long, you seem to have misunderstood something. I&#x27;m helping him become stronger using the most scientific and efficient methods. And what about you? What&#x27;s the point of taking him to do those primitive and inefficient physical training exercises every day other than getting him beaten up a few more times? You L Yings pretty face instantly turned cold and her fists clenched instinctively. Such Ching Zu words not only negated her training methods, but also negated the traditional martial arts that she represented, which had been passed down for thousands of years.</p>
<p>My method may be primitive, but every step is solid and steady, forging his will and foundation. Longing retorted coldly, &quot;Your method is nothing but forcing growth, using all sorts of potent drugs and extreme external stimuli to forcibly unleash his potential. This will severely deplete his vitality and even shake the foundation of his martial arts.&quot; Foundation, willpower. Suching sarcasm deepened. She raised her wrist and tapped the communicator lightly, projecting a complex human data flow model diagram into the air.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, what era are we living in? You still believe in these vague and unrealistic things? In my opinion, the human body is a highly sophisticated machine, the so-called foundation, and will learn nothing more than chemical substances secreted by the cerebral cortex and electrical signals from neurons. As long as there is enough data and the model is accurate, I can create a hundred or a thousand warriors with even stronger wills than him at any time, you are blaspheming life. No, I am exploring the ultimate mystery of life. The atmosphere in the laboratory instantly became tense. A traditional martial art that represents thousands of years of heritage.</p>
<p>One represents the ever evolving cuttingedge technology. Two completely different ideas collided most fiercely at this moment. Shin Yuan, caught in the middle, felt utterly overwhelmed. These two women, they can argue all they want. But why are they using him as an argument in a debate, but he glanced at Su Ching Xu, who was engaged in a heated argument with Ling, yet still subtly hinted at her arm with her Jilele nuclear weapon, and then at Ling, whose chest heaved violently with anger, making her appear even more dashing.</p>
<p>This chaotic scene seems pretty exciting, just as he was lost in thought. The war between Su Chinghu and Longing entered a heated phase. My neural overload resonance device can double his mental strength within 3 days. My dual cultivation of dragon soul and battle body can purify his vital energy and elevate his control over power to a new level. My gene activating agent can regenerate his severed limbs.</p>
<p>My five forms of military strategy can make him withstand artillery shells with his bare body. Listening to the two wealthy women, like rich women bidding against each other at an auction, frantically comparing their dowies, Shin Yuan&#x27;s eyes grew brighter and brighter. What? These two are both gems. You&#x27;ll make a huge profit no matter which one you choose. Seeing that the two were about to escalate their verbal battle into a physical one, Shinuan knew that he had to choose sides.</p>
<p>Although Su Ching Xu&#x27;s technology and ruthless skills sound very tempting, especially that G-LE human nuclear weapon, it is indeed top-notch. But the thought of the centrifugal training chamber that could drive people crazy and the neural overload resonance device that sounded terrible just from its name sent a chill down Shin Yuan spine. He made a decisive choice. He abruptly broke free from Su Ching Xus grasp, rushed behind Ling, and like a school child seeking refuge, poked half his head out, and loudly proclaimed in a righteous tone, &quot;I support instructor Long, a balance between work and rest is essential for maximizing efficiency.&quot; &quot;Health is the foundation of everything. I request to begin medicinal bath recovery training immediately.&quot; This sudden betrayal froze the smile on Su Chinghus face.</p>
<p>Her sharp eyes, hidden behind her gold- rimmed glasses, stared straight at Shun Yuan, her gaze seeming to say, &quot;You little guinea pig, how dare you betray me. You just wait.&quot; Upon hearing his words, Ling, who was standing in front of him, relaxed her tense body almost imperceptibly. She had a cold face, but a hint of smuggness flashed deep in her icy phoenix eyes. This bastard isn&#x27;t completely hopeless, after all. Shin Yuan naturally didn&#x27;t miss her subtle change in expression and his heart was immediately filled with joy.</p>
<p>It seems like I made the right choice in taking sides this time. Ding. A slight wavering in the target Ly Yings mental defenses has been detected. Icebreaking progress plus 1%. Current progress 96%.</p>
<p>Really? Shinyuan was overjoyed. It seemed that this ice queen was susceptible to this kind of thing. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Suching Zu did not insist any further. She gave the two of them a meaningful look, a look that sent chills down their spines. She shrugged and slowly walked to the herbal bath preparation station next to her.</p>
<p>As she worked with the bottles and jars, she said in a casual tone, &quot;All right, now that our little hero has spoken, that&#x27;s all for today&#x27;s science tutorial.&quot; But she turned around and poured a vial of potion, which emitted an eerie purple light, into the bathtub, causing the water to sizzle softly. Then she gave the two of them a very kind smile. To make up for the losses caused by the interruption of today&#x27;s experiment, I made some minor optimizations to this medicinal bath formula. She walked up to Longing, extended her gloved hand, patted her shoulder affectionately, and spoke slowly and deliberately in an extremely concerned tone. So, instructor Long, to ensure the optimized medicine is perfectly absorbed, I&#x27;ll have to trouble you a lot tonight.</p>
<p>A very ominous premonition instantly rose in Long Yings heart. This woman is definitely up to no good. Chapter 60. The devil&#x27;s whisper. The iceberg collapsed.</p>
<p>Inside a high-tech pharmacy bathroom, the familiar crimson liquid churned in the bathtub. But today, the magma&#x27;s color was eerily deep, its surface shrouded in a strange purple halo. Shinuan was already used to this. He quickly stripped naked. Since the two women had already seen everything, he decided to completely let loose and had no psychological burden.</p>
<p>He even deliberately puffed out his increasingly strong and muscular chest and whistled loudly at Ling, who was pretending to adjust the equipment next to him, but kept glancing over out of the corner of her eye. L Yings body stiffened abruptly, her ears turned bright red, and even her fair neck was tinged with pink. That shameless bastard. Just as Shin Yuan was about to dive into the bathtub and enjoy this bittersweet daily routine, a fragrant breeze wafted over and Su Chingu appeared behind him like a ghost. She leaned close to Shan Yuans ear, her breath sweet as orchids, and whispered in a devilishly seductive volume that only the two of them could hear.</p>
<p>This is a special product from the Umbrella Corporation, cenamed Sarif&#x27;s Kiss. Its effects are similar to the previous fallen angel&#x27;s breath, but this one is gentler, primarily used to stimulate the body&#x27;s potential. Shinyuan&#x27;s pupils suddenly contracted, another one of those potent drugs. What exactly does this female demon want to do? Such seemed quite pleased with his shocked expression. Her slender hands, gloved in white, traced circles on his muscular chest with a light touch, her voice becoming increasingly seductive.</p>
<p>Tonight, I want you to melt that iceberg completely. Ideally, she should be so exhausted by tomorrow that she won&#x27;t be able to get out of bed and won&#x27;t even have the energy to train. As long as you succeed, she paused and behind her glasses, her beautiful eyes shown with a fervor that made Shun Yuans heart tremble. I&#x27;ll let you study me once. These last few words were like a bolt of lightning, striking Shun Yuan directly on the top of his head.</p>
<p>Study her once. Is this the research you were thinking of? He subconsciously turned his head, his gaze sweeping over Su Ching Xus intelligent and pretty face so close to his and the G-level human nuclear weapon that even the white coat couldn&#x27;t hide. Who the hell can handle this deal? Shin Yuans mind was made up. Su Ching Zu smiled, a smile that sent chills down Shin Yuans spine. She straightened up and under Lyings questioning gaze, gracefully walked to the door, even thoughtfully locking the heavy alloy door from the outside.</p>
<p>Click. A soft sound. In this quiet laboratory was like the sounding of a war horn. The entire space was now empty except for Shun Yuan and Longing and a pool of medicinal liquid from which purple mist was constantly rising. Longing looked at the locked door, then at Shun Yuan, who was staring at her with wolf-like eyes, and her ominous premonition grew stronger.</p>
<p>What are you looking at? She felt uncomfortable under Shin Yuan&#x27;s undisguised gaze and subconsciously took a step back. It&#x27;s nothing. Shinyuan&#x27;s smile looked anything but malicious. Without another word, he plunged head first into the churning purple liquid. Longing hesitated for a moment, but when she thought about how the dragon soul battle body would enhance her strength, she finally suppressed her doubts.</p>
<p>The black, tight-fitting combat suit was neatly removed. Every inch of his skin is firm and smooth without a single bit of excess fat. Especially those long legs with their strong and powerful lines are works of art honed through countless battles. The arches of the feet are stretched into a beautiful curve, and the toes are white and shiny, yet you can see the terrifying power they contain, capable of shattering steel plates. She stroed into the bathtub and sat cross-legged opposite Shinuan.</p>
<p>Give me your hand. Shinuan grinned mischievously and extended his hand. When their palms met in the scalding medicinal liquid, the dual cultivation officially began. At first, everything was normal. The golden dragon soul power and the primordial energy mixed with the dragon bloodline in Shun Yuan&#x27;s body completed one cycle after another in their meridians.</p>
<p>Both of their skills are steadily improving. However, a dozen minutes later, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. A strange, frenzied heat, without warning, swept over her limbs and bones, causing her composure and self-control to crumble little by little. Her breathing became rapid and hot. An unnatural, alluring blush rose on her fair skin.</p>
<p>Hoohoo! She opened her eyes and met Shun Yuans gaze, which was already burning with intense passion. Ly Yings heart skipped a beat. &quot;Such Ching Xu,&quot; that woman poisoned the medicine. She gasped in shock, her voice filled with barely suppressed panic. She tried to pull her hand away, wanting to escape from the dangerous bathtub.</p>
<p>But why would Shin Yuan give her that opportunity? He broke free from her grasp, and like a nimble fish swimming in the water, he drew an arc and moved closer to her. Shinuan&#x27;s approach felt like a mountain pressing down on them. Longing retreated in alarm, that damn drug was not only eroding her will, but also weakening her power. Don&#x27;t come any closer. Shen Yuans face loomed large before her eyes.</p>
<p>His deep voice burning with heat rang in her ears. Instructor Long, have you forgotten what Dr. Su just said? He deliberately misinterpreted Su Ching Xus words, each one like a heavy hammer blow to Ly Yings already crumbling defenses. Shin Yuan, how dare you? What do I have to be afraid of? Shin Yuan forcefully pulled her helpless body into his arms, still pretending, his voice, horsearse yet magnetic, whispered like a devil into Long Yings ears. These past few days, my heart has been racing every time I see people next door.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you envious? Aren&#x27;t you itching to try it yourself? Now it&#x27;s your turn. Why are you scared again? You&#x27;re talking nonsense. I didn&#x27;t. Long Yings pretty face flushed red, and her voice was soft and weak, lacking any persuasiveness. The scene that morning, along with countless nights before when she was annoyed by the noise from next door, made it impossible for her to deny.</p>
<p>No. Shinuan chuckled lightly. His tone suddenly became contemptuous and full of sarcasm. The youngest future female warrior of the Umbrella Corporation, an SS level genius, and a grand marshall master of the fourth realm. What are you hesitating about? What are you afraid of? Your pride is preventing you from bowing your head.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;ll take this opportunity to help you. Chapter 61. An iceberg suppressed medicine war god&#x27;s powerful attack. These words were piercing to the heart. Each word was like a red-hot steel needle barbed piercing deep into long yings heart and then suddenly pulled outward.</p>
<p>Her pretty face flushed from the effects of the medicine lost three tints of its color instantly followed by a surge of even deeper shame and indignation that made her face turned bright red. awareness contribution. She Ly Ying joined the company at 15, became a martial arts master at 18, and at 20, she single-handedly infiltrated enemy territory, taking the heads of three federal rank equals amidst a vast army. At the age of 22, she was promoted to the fourth realm of Grand Marshall Master, becoming the youngest female war goddess in the history of the Umbrella Corporation. She has shed more blood for the company than this scoundrel in front of her has drunk water.</p>
<p>But what about now? In this bastard&#x27;s mouth, she became a piece of trash who only knew how to take from the company, never gave anything back, and was even worse than an ordinary girl. On what grounds? Based on his unreasonable F-level talent? Oh, a surge of rage and resentment erupted from the deepest part of Long Yings heart. She has to prove herself. She wanted this man to know that whether as a warrior or as a woman, she, Lying, would always be at the very top. The heat within her body not only failed to extinguish her rationality, but instead became the best catalyst, completely igniting the pride and competitiveness deeply buried in her bones as an SS level genius.</p>
<p>Good. Longing looked at the face in front of her that was still babbling on and on, trying to completely break down her defenses with words, and suddenly smiled. That smile was cold, dangerous, and carried a madness of mutual destruction. Shin Yuans heart skipped a beat, and the hairs on the back of his head stood on end instantly. &quot;Has this woman gone too far? Has she really driven herself mad? Didn&#x27;t you say that my awareness was insufficient?&quot; Ly Yings voice suddenly became incredibly calm.</p>
<p>So calm it was unsettling. &quot;Didn&#x27;t you want to help me keep the flame burning?&quot; She slowly raised her hand, her phoenix eyes, misty with the effects of the medicine, fixed intently on Shun Yuan, like a beast locking onto its prey. Very good. Today, I&#x27;ll show you with your own eyes just how high my awareness really is. Before he could finish speaking, Longing made a move.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of Shun Yuan&#x27;s wide, astonished eyes, she pounced on him. That perfect body, brimming with power and athleticism, unleashed terrifying speed and strength befitting her status as a grand marshall master. Shin Yuan felt a blur before his eyes, and then an overwhelming force slammed into his chest. Bang! With a heavy thud, his back slammed solidly against the hard, cold alloy bathtub edge, the pain almost making him gasp for breath. Before he could react, an enlarged image of a face, breathtakingly beautiful yet filled with madness and despair, loomed down.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s brain went blank for a second. He was, was he killed? The script is wrong. Whether on the battlefield or on this special battlefield, she longing will always be the ruler. Just as Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind went blank, completely bewildered by this shocking reversal, the system notifications in his mind flooded the screen like a burst dam. Ding.</p>
<p>A crack has been detected in the target dragon Yings iceberg heart. Icebreaking progress plus 1%. Ding. Target Long Yings emotions fluctuated violently and her mental defenses were completely shaken. Icebreaking progress plus 1%.</p>
<p>Ding. Icebreaking progress plus 1%. A series of notification sounds gradually brought Shun Yuan back to his senses. He suddenly understood. This iceberg has finally been driven mad by its own actions.</p>
<p>She is using the most extreme yet most endearing way to mask her inner turmoil and to maintain her ridiculous yet admirable pride. Shinuan also wanted to let this iceberg know how naive her so-called strength was in front of him. A seasoned veteran, Tom seemed to stretch out infinitely at this moment. When that last system notification sound rang in Shin Yuans mind, ding, icebreaking progress 100%. Congratulations, host.</p>
<p>You have successfully shattered the outer shell of the Imperial War Goddess. Ly Yings once cold and sharp Phoenix eyes were now filled with confusion and bewilderment. Now, a glint of predatory light, like that of a hungry wolf, flashed in Shun Yuans eyes. The roles of host and guest have been reversed. He looked at her stunningly beautiful face, which was even more captivating and alluring due to her emotions and confusion, and a wicked and vengeful smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, your practical teaching doesn&#x27;t seem to be very effective. But it&#x27;s okay. Now it&#x27;s the students turn to repay you properly. Chapter 62. After a night of madness, he broke through to the mid-stage of Marshall Master.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan slowly opened his eyes and turned his head to look at Long Ying, who was still fast asleep beside him. Shinji couldn&#x27;t help but lean down. Just then, h long Yings long eyelashes trembled slightly, and she let out a soft moan before slowly opening her Phoenix eyes, which were still misty with tears. Their eyes met when she saw the magnified handsome face with a smug, mischievous grin before her. The memories of last night resurfaced.</p>
<p>Boom! A surge of heat rushed from her chest to the top of her head, and her face turned red from the base of her neck all the way to the tips of her hair. Shame, indignation, humiliation, and a strange, inexplicable feeling that she herself couldn&#x27;t understand, which made her feel flustered were all intertwined. Roll. Almost instinctively, Longing kicked Shin Yuan hard in the chest. Bang! Caught off guard, Shin Yuan was kicked squarely in the chest, letting out a howl as he was sent flying off the bed and crashing onto the cold floor in a disheveled state.</p>
<p>He rubbed his sore bottom and grimaced as he got up from the ground. This little winch&#x27;s kicking power has decreased. Longing was so angry at Shun Yuan&#x27;s smug and self-satisfied attitude that she almost ground her teeth to powder. She struggled to sit up and frantically grabbed the clothes scattered on the floor. With lightning speed, she shoved her jade-like feet into the hard black military boots.</p>
<p>As if only in this way could she gain a pitiful sense of security. When she was fully dressed and transformed back into the valiant female warrior, Shinuan was also dressed and leaning against the doorway with a grin, watching her. Instructor Long, aren&#x27;t you going to sleep a little longer? He asked the question knowingly, his tone full of teasing. If you don&#x27;t replenish your energy, you might not be able to handle today&#x27;s training. L Yings pretty face instantly turned even colder.</p>
<p>She walked up to Shun Yuan, her sharp phoenix eyes scanning him up and down as if she wanted to tear him to pieces with her gaze. She held it in for a long time, finally managing to squeeze out a few words through gritted teeth. Double the training. On the training field, the atmosphere was colder than freezing. Longing didn&#x27;t say a word, but simply pointed to the ground with her chin.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan understood immediately and obediently lay down. He had thought that today&#x27;s training session would be warmer and more intimate because of last night&#x27;s conversation, but he soon realized that he had been overthinking things. When Lyings feet, clad in sturdy black military boots, stomped heavily on his back, Shin Yuan felt as if his spine was about to break. &quot;What? Longing, you&#x27;re serious?&quot; Shinuan cried out in pain. &quot;I&#x27;m wearing shoes.</p>
<p>This pressure is too much. It&#x27;ll crush me. Shut up.&quot; Long Yings voice was even colder and harder than the military boots on her feet. Practice or don&#x27;t practice. It&#x27;s up to you.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re not going to practice, go back to your woman. Instructor Long, that&#x27;s not what I meant. Shinyan immediately adopted a wrong tone. What I mean is, you&#x27;re under a lot of pressure wearing shoes. You&#x27;re asking for it.</p>
<p>L Yings face flushed red instantly, and the energy flowing into her feet suddenly intensified. A dash. Shiny Yuan screams echoed in the training room. He discovered that every time he asked to alleviate the pressure, he was met with even more brutal suppression from Long Ying and a murderous glare in her eyes. The subsequent sparring sessions made him realize even more what it means to be the most poisonous heart is that of a woman.</p>
<p>Ly Yings attacks were all aimed at the lower body with tricky angles and ruthless force. Several times, she accidentally poked Shin Yuan&#x27;s face with the hard toe of her military boot, leaving clear gray shoe prints. Shin Yuan was so angry at her blatant act of settling personal scores that he yelled loudly. Longing, you&#x27;re murdering your husband. If you dare utter another word of nonsense, I&#x27;ll show you today why flowers are so red.</p>
<p>Ly Yings attacks became more ferocious and more unpredictable. She was like a cat that had been provoked, bearing all her claws and unleashing a furious barrage of attacks on Shin Yuan. However, what shocked her was Shinuan seemed to be on a high today, as if he had been injected with chicken blood. No matter how she attacked, no matter how much force she used, this bastard could always get up from the ground again in the next second and then continue to provoke her in an even more shameless and lewd way. The anger of being humiliated, coupled with his indomitable spirit, unleashed unprecedented potential in Shiny Yuan.</p>
<p>He felt the blood and energy in his body boiling and burning wildly under this extreme pressure and pain. That bottleneck leading to the mid-stage of the third realm marshall master is being challenged time and time again. Boom! Just as Longing delivered another powerful whip kick, sending him flying once again. A muffled rumble came from inside Shin Yuan&#x27;s body. Ding! Intense and brutal training underway.</p>
<p>Train harder and double your talent benefits. Ding! YourQi and blood points have surpassed 30,000. Congratulations, host. You have successfully advanced to the mid-stage of the third realm marshall master. It&#x27;s done.</p>
<p>Another breakthrough. Even though Shun Yuan was beaten black and blue and looked extremely miserable, he was secretly overjoyed. He shakily got up from the ground, feeling the powerful surge of energy within him, and his aura strengthened even more. He wiped the mark off his face and gave Ling, who was panting heavily across from him, a bright but irritating smile. Instructor Long, thank you for your guidance.</p>
<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve become stronger again. Chapter 63. Washing instructor Iceberg&#x27;s feet. Longing looked at him and her heart skipped a beat for no reason. This man has become stronger again.</p>
<p>How long has it been? From an ordinary person who couldn&#x27;t even kill a chicken to a genuine mid-stage third realm martial artist. She even felt extremely agrieved. She had fought so hard to beat him up. But in the end, she became a catalyst for him to become stronger. What kind of situation was that? looking at his bruised and swollen face, yet still smug, Long Yings anger flared up.</p>
<p>Training is over. She composed herself, forcibly suppressing the strange feeling, and with a cold face, turned and left. She didn&#x27;t want to spend another second with this bastard, afraid she wouldn&#x27;t be able to resist pinning him to the ground and stomping on him again. However, as soon as she turned around, her wrist was grabbed tightly by a hot and powerful hand. Long Yings body stiffened, and her instincts from years of training made her instinctively want to twist her body and perform an over-the-shoulder throw.</p>
<p>But Shin Yuans voice rang in her ears first, deep and horsearo, with an undeniable force. During training, you are the instructor, and I will listen to you. It&#x27;s break time now, so it&#x27;s my turn to call the shots. Before he could finish speaking, Lyings phoenix eyes were filled with astonishment and doubt. Shin Yuan suddenly pulled her into his arms, catching her offg guard and causing her to crash solidly into his hot and firm chest.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, she felt her body lighten, and in a dizzying moment, she was lifted up by his waist. A classic princess carry. Shinuan, what are you doing? Put me down. Longing panicked. This is still inside the Umbrella Corporation headquarters.</p>
<p>If someone saw her being held in such an embarrassing position by a man, wouldn&#x27;t she have any shame afterward? She began to struggle frantically in Shun Yuans arms with both hands and feet. Don&#x27;t move. Shin Yuan let out a low shout, and his doineering aura caused Ly Yings body to pause subconsciously for a moment. In that brief pause, Shinuan had already carried her and stroed towards her private suite. &quot;Damn it! Are you on company grounds?&quot; Ling was both ashamed and angry, her cheeks burning hot, and she could only threaten in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Shin Yuan looked down at the icy beauty in his arms, who was still squirming, but whose face was flushed with shame and indignation, and a wicked smile appeared on his lips. He announced in her ear with a self-righteous robbers logic. As your man, it is my duty to wash your feet clean. Wash your feet. Longing was stunned by his shocking remarks and for a moment forgot to struggle.</p>
<p>Bang! Shinyuan kicked open her bedroom door, picked her up, and carried her straight to the soft bed in the bedroom where he threw her onto it without any tenderness. Longing was dizzy from the fall, and her military uniform jacket was disheveled. Just as she propped herself up to sit up, she saw Shin Yuan walk into the bathroom on his own. Soon, the sound of running water came from the bathroom. A short while later, Shin Yuan came out carrying a basin of steaming hot water for washing feet.</p>
<p>He placed the basin of water beside the bed, then plopped down, staring intently at Longing. Longing felt uncomfortable under his gaze and instinctively tried to hide her feet behind her back. But Shin Yuan was faster than her. He grabbed her ankle, which was clad in a black military boot with a rough yet irresistible motion and began to slowly untie her shoelaces. &quot;Don&#x27;t touch me.&quot; Longing flinched as if she had been electrocuted.</p>
<p>&quot;Should we move again?&quot; Shin Yuan raised his head, his eyes filled with undisguised aggression like a hungry wolf locking onto its prey. Believe it or not, I&#x27;ll be here tonight. Lyings heart skipped a beat. She had no doubt that given the bastard&#x27;s shamelessness, he was absolutely capable of doing such a thing. She immediately cowered, biting her lip and daring not to move.</p>
<p>She could only watch helplessly as he, with those same large hands that had taken countless advantage of her, roughly removed her military boots. He looked up at Long Yings profile, which was half red from embarrassment and indignation, and his wicked smile grew even brighter. Long Ying felt a chill run down her spine under his gaze, as if she had been stripped naked and placed under a spotlight for people to admire at will. She couldn&#x27;t help but raise her other foot and gently kick him, saying with a mix of embarrassment and annoyance, &quot;What are you doawling about while washing your feet?&quot; &quot;Hurry up!&quot; The force was so weak and soft that it was more like a playful tantrum than a kick. Hey.</p>
<p>Hey. The Umbrella Corporation headquarters, five floors underground, houses the highest level interrogation room. The atmosphere was so oppressive that it was hard to breathe. Angelina was firmly strapped to a cold metal chair. She looked at Natasha, who was radiant on the opposite sofa and whose every move exuded a charming femininity.</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with jealousy and resentment. It&#x27;s only been a few days. The Black Widow, whom he had once manipulated and humiliated at will, seemed to have been reborn. but he himself became a prisoner. &quot;Angelina, tell me everything you know.&quot; Natasha held a glass of red wine, took a slow sip, and said with a hint of Victor&#x27;s langor, &quot;You should know what happens when you fall into the hands of the Umbrella Corporation and resist to the end.&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; Angelina spat at her, her eyes filled with venom.</p>
<p>&quot;You traitor! Do you think you&#x27;ll get away with this? When the Federation Army arrives, you and that dog of a man will be burned to ashes.&quot; Natasha&#x27;s face instantly darkened. She put down her wine glass, a hint of murderous intent flashing in her eyes. But she held back because she tried every interrogation technique she knew. Psychological manipulation, psychological pressure, drug manipulation. Angelina&#x27;s mind was like it was locked with an unbreakable lock.</p>
<p>The lock would automatically activate whenever the most crucial secrets were touched, causing her to instantly descend into madness and even self harm. Chapter 64. Dr. Sue&#x27;s insane plan. Inside the observation room at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, Lie Slender fingers tapped unconsciously on the control panel.</p>
<p>Zhia Xenua crossed his arms, his brows furrowed. The two looked at their helpless subordinate through the one-way glass, their expressions grave. The federal government&#x27;s methods are becoming increasingly dirty. Ziao Jinga spoke in a deep voice, his tone tinged with suppressed anger. This mental restriction was no different from ancient sorcery.</p>
<p>To break it by force would require using a soul searching technique, but the cost would be too high. Just when the atmosphere in the interrogation room reached its lowest point, click. The heavy alloy door slid open to one side. A tall figure walked in gracefully, wearing a pair of scarlet high heels. The newcomer was dressed in a spotless white lab coat and carried a silver metal briefcase.</p>
<p>Every step he took seemed to be on the beat of everyone&#x27;s heartbeats. It was Su Ching Xu. As soon as she entered, her gaze swept quickly across the entire room. A blonde bombshell bound to an experimental table, her face filled with despair. A former colleague stood to the side, sweating profusely.</p>
<p>And in the observation room, there were two grandmasters of the fifth realm, their brows furrowed in worry. Such pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and a playful smile appeared on her intellectual and beautiful face. Mental restrictions are essentially nothing more than a special instruction lock written into the gene sequence. Her voice was exceptionally clear, and her calm yet slightly magnetic tone instantly made her the focus of the entire room. She stroed up to Angelina, looking down at the trembling woman.</p>
<p>Behind her glasses, her beautiful eyes gleamed with a fanatical light that sent chills down Angelina&#x27;s spine as if she were looking at a specimen of great research value. Since it&#x27;s a lock, it naturally has a key. Or if Su Ching Xus lips curl into a slight smile, we can be more direct and smash the lock open without a key. Dr. Su, do you have any ideas? Lean&#x27;s voice came from the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>The solution is quite simple. Su Ching Zu placed the suitcase on the control panel next to her and opened it with a click. Inside the box, a complex head-mounted device covered with electrodes and wires gleamed with a cold metallic luster under the light. my latest research and development, a high-frequency acoustic resonator. She picked up the instrument, which resembled a medieval torture device, and spoke slowly and deliberately, as if introducing her prize creation.</p>
<p>It can resonate directly with neurons in the cerebral cortex through infrasound of a specific frequency, forcibly disrupting her brain waves and causing her to fall into a sleepwalking state that is between wakefulness and dreams. In this state, the mental restrictions in her subconscious will be suppressed to the minimum and she will say whatever you want to know. But then she changed the subject, her gaze passing through the glass to Li Yun and Xiao Jingwa, her smile turning somewhat cruel. This method has a minor side effect. The success rate is only 50%.</p>
<p>If she fails, the powerful infrasound resonance will instantly destroy her cerebral cortex, turning her into an idiot who can only drool and doesn&#x27;t even know who she is. his dash. A collective gasp filled the interrogation room. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua exchanged glances, both seeing the hesitation in each other&#x27;s eyes. This risk is too great.</p>
<p>Angelina on the lab table was terrified, her face turning deathly pale, and her body began to convulse violently. A pungent foul odor instantly filled the air. Between death and becoming an idiot, her so-called ACE agent will proved incredibly fragile. No. No.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll beg you to tell me. I&#x27;ll tell you everything. She broke down, screaming and crying uncontrollably. However, Su Ching Zu ignored her please for mercy and simply put the cold head-mounted device on her head. It&#x27;s too late.</p>
<p>Su Chingus voice was icy cold, devoid of any human emotion. When you chose to use such dirty tricks to deal with our company&#x27;s gem, you lost the right to beg for mercy. She reached out and gently adjusted the electrodes on Angelina&#x27;s head. Her movements as gentle as if she were handling a precious work of art. Right now, you&#x27;re just my experiment.</p>
<p>In this delicate and tense atmosphere, Natasha, who was standing in the corner, suddenly felt a very slight vibration from the tiny communicator disguised as a bracelet on her wrist. This subtle movement did not escape Leian&#x27;s sharp eyes. Lean nodded to Natasha without making a sound. Natasha understood. She walked to the corner of the interrogation room, pretending to tidy her clothes, but actually quickly turned on her communicator.</p>
<p>An S-level encrypted message from the Federal Supreme Command appeared on the miniature light screen in front of her. When she saw the contents of the message, her bright blue eyes suddenly narrowed. She immediately shared the message in its entirety with Li Yun and Xiao Jingws communication channels. Inside the observation room, Li Yun and Xiao Jinga watched the encrypted message that had been quickly deciphered, and their expressions instantly became incredibly interesting. Intelligence confirmed.</p>
<p>The targets flame dragon bloodline talent is Srank with enormous potential. They must be controlled. The failure of the Black Widow operation proves that the targets security forces are extremely strong and conventional methods have failed. To ensure the plan goes perfectly, the Supreme Council has decided to dispatch Countest Blood Rose Akasha to East Sea City to personally oversee the arrest operation. Order.</p>
<p>All undercover personnel must unconditionally cooperate with the countess&#x27;s operations. Countess of Blood Rose Akasha. Upon seeing this name, even Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua paused for a moment. That&#x27;s not comparable to Angelina Jolie, who rose to fame through her body and drugs. Akasha, 30 years old, is one of the future direct heirs of the Rothschild family, one of the oldest families in the Free Federation.</p>
<p>She not only possesses unparalleled beauty and aristocratic bearing that could drive any man mad, but she is also a genuine, terrifyingly powerful expert at the level of a grandmaster of the fifth realm. His talent is the legendary SS level, blood control. Rumor has it that this woman is ruthless and cruel, and she especially likes to turn handsome and talented young geniuses into her blood slaves who only know how to take and kill. Such a terrifying woman actually came to Donghai City in person. And the target is Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Good heavens. Ziao Jingwa slapped his thigh, showing no sign of worry, and even laughed wickedly. This is ridiculous. They&#x27;re just handing out kills, and they&#x27;re sending a huge one at that. Bigger is better.</p>
<p>Li Yun instantly understood. Xiao Jing was meaning. Looking at the stunning photo of Akasha on the screen, she laughed and said, &quot;A grandmaster of the fifth realm with SS level talent is a walking treasure trove of jeans. New prey has actually come to us.&quot; Moreover, she is a top tier beauty with a noble status, formidable strength, and stunning looks. Chapter 65.</p>
<p>A new prey, the countest. Inside the command center of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters. After a brief moment of silence, the atmosphere instantly ignited. You choose the path to heaven, but refuse to take it. While barging into the gates of hell when there are none, Leun tapped her fingers lightly on the cold control panel, her sharp eyes fixed on the names on the intelligence report, her gaze filled with the burning intensity of a hunter locking onto a top prey.</p>
<p>A 30-year-old grandmaster of the fifth realm and a stunningly beautiful countest with SS level talent. if we could turn her to our side. The thought that those old guys in the Federal Supreme Council would probably have a stroke on the spot if they found out about this made Lee Yun feel her blood rushing. She nudged her husband with her elbow, her eyes full of calculation. Jingua, do you think we should give that busy young master of the company more responsibilities? Xiao Jingua grinned, a shrewd glint flashing across his honest, square face.</p>
<p>Add it. It absolutely must be added. He slammed his hand on the table, making the water glass vibrate loudly. Such a good trophy. Delivered right to his doorstep.</p>
<p>Why not take it? That kid is full of youthful vigor right now. One more or one less won&#x27;t make a difference. The two of them, in a few words, turned the blood rose countest who was thousands of miles away and of extremely high status into a white rabbit about to fall into a trap. Standing in the corner, Natasha listened to the two company tycoons unabashedly LWD words and felt a chill run from the soles of her feet to the top of her head. She recalled how in just a few days she had gone from a proud top agent to someone that man could take advantage of at will.</p>
<p>I was reminded of Angelina Zoli&#x27;s disgraceful breakdown and incontinence on the interrogation table. He also recalled Su Ching Xus appearance with her gold rimmed glasses behind which gleamed a crazy light. Then think about this soon-to-be countest who is superior to him in both status and strength. Natasha couldn&#x27;t help but silently mourn for three seconds for that colleague she had never met. She could almost foresee the inhumane treatment that the high and mighty countest would suffer after falling into the hands of these demons.</p>
<p>Natasha Leons cool voice pulled her back from her chaotic thoughts. Report back to the Federation immediately. Lean walked to Natasha&#x27;s side, patted her on the shoulder, and decisively ordered, &quot;Tell them that a few days ago, you did see a man who resembled your target from a distance at the Phantom Bar. But beside that man was a stunningly beautiful bodyguard with unfathomable strength and an icy, knifelike demeanor.&quot; Lie Yun pictured Long Yings perpetually icy face and a slight smile involuntarily crept onto her lips. &quot;Because of your lowly status, you couldn&#x27;t get close at all.</p>
<p>The moment you approached, the female bodyguard gave you a warning look, almost exposing you on the spot. That&#x27;s why you didn&#x27;t report it immediately. This intelligence is flawless. It perfectly explains why Natasha didn&#x27;t report in time, which not only fits the fact that her operation failed, but also successfully maximizes the mystery and security level of the target. This further convinced the federal authorities of the existence of the company&#x27;s eldest son.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand. Natasha nodded immediately. Her awe of Le Yun had reached a whole new level. Sure enough, when Natasha sent this carefully crafted false intelligence back through an encrypted channel, the federal government responded almost instantly. Received, &quot;Lidow, you did a great job.</p>
<p>Continue to lie low and don&#x27;t make any rash moves.&quot; Countest Akasha will arrive in Donghai City in three days aboard her private jet, the Crimson Thorn. At that time, she will personally take action to first control that spoiled brat with the S-rank flame dragon bloodline and then use him as a springboard to find a way to contact and kidnap the real target. Your task is to fully cooperate with Kakashas actions. Looking at the lines of greedy text on the screen, Li Yun and Xiao Jingua exchanged a glance, both seeing the bright smile in each other&#x27;s eyes. Success! Xiao Jingwa clapped his hands excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;These idiots really took the bait. This is going to be interesting. Leian glanced with interest at Su Ching Xu who was enthusiastically analyzing Angelina&#x27;s brainwave data beside her and teased her. Ching Xu new experimental materials have been delivered. Shouldn&#x27;t our company&#x27;s young master Shin prepare them in advance? Let him have a good time and let that high and mighty countest see how powerful our company&#x27;s young master Shin is.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu pushed up her gold rimmed glasses, her slender fingers tracing across the screen to bring up another set of data. I&#x27;m afraid that won&#x27;t work. She pointed at Shin Yuan on the screen, whose body had just been radiating intense heat on that intelligent and beautiful face. A rare hint of annoyance at the disruption of her plans was revealed. Based on my data analysis, the experimental subject Shin Yuan&#x27;s recent training intensity has been too high and his body is in a critical period of rapid gene chain recombination.</p>
<p>It is not advisable for him to receive new external hormonal stimulation to avoid data disorder. Moreover, a glint of light flashed in her eyes behind her glasses. Upon hearing this, Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua nodded in deep agreement. Chapter 66. The iceberg has just thawed and the cold moon has arrived.</p>
<p>The next morning, inside Shin Yuans private fortress. The atmosphere was extremely strange. Shin Yuan was kneeling on one knee by the bed like a husband who had made a mistake, carefully helping Longing put on her shoes. Longing had a stunningly beautiful face, her expression as cold as ice, as if it could freeze the air in the room. But her rosy ears and her phoenix eyes that kept darting away, completely avoiding Shun Yuans gaze, betrayed her inner shame, anger, and panic.</p>
<p>Hurry up. What are you doawling for? Yes, sir. Roll. Longing was filled with shame and indignation and kicked him hard. Shin Yuan laughed and dodged away, then quickly helped her put on the other military boot.</p>
<p>Instructor Long, it&#x27;s time for breakfast. Today is our first day living together, so we can&#x27;t be late. He deliberately emphasized the words cohabitation. Long Yings pretty face flushed even more instantly. The atmosphere in the restaurant of Fortress 1 was strangely harmonious.</p>
<p>The large dining table was filled with various breakfast dishes made from the flesh and blood of top grade exotic beasts, all of which were delicious and visually appealing. Lyn Sharon, dressed in a loose maternity dress, was happily eating the dragon blood shrimp that Shinuan had peeled for her. She radiated a gentle yet sacred maternal glow, and her already exquisite face, bathed in the morning light, was breathtakingly beautiful. Beside her, Natasha stood quietly behind Shinuan like a most obedient maid, holding a glass of freshlysqueezed juice from the fountain of life, radiating rich life energy, ready to serve him at any time. Her eyes were filled with complex emotions when she looked at Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>There was awe, fear, gratitude, and even a trace of dependence. Long Ying, who had just escaped from her room, sat expressionlessly on the other side of Shen Yuan, silently stabbing the roasted Earth dragon meat on her plate with her fork, as if she wanted to turn all the shame and anger in her heart into her appetite. The three women gathered together. A pure and innocent beauty like a white lotus from the sacred school. A seductive beauty from an enemy country as alluring as a venomous scorpion.</p>
<p>A peerless war god as cold and beautiful as an iceberg. Three distinctly different top beauties are now sitting together harmoniously sharing breakfast all because of the same man. If this scene were to get out, it would drive all the men in the world crazy. Shin Yuan sat in the main seat with women on his left and right, although longing wouldn&#x27;t let him hug them, enjoying this emperor-like treatment. The sense of satisfaction and pride in his heart was almost overflowing.</p>
<p>This is what life is all about. With a bang, the sweet door was once again violently pushed open. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua led a tall, slender, and aloof beauty with short, neat hair into the room. Shin Yuan stared intently and was instantly stunned. Isn&#x27;t this L Yu? the A-level talent who was unfortunately eliminated during the selection process because of her ordinary physique, resulting in a total score of only 94 points.</p>
<p>Why is she here? And Shin Yuan&#x27;s gaze unconsciously fell on her chest. What is this? The same person. The cold moon before him was completely different from the washboardike doineering woman in Shun Yuan&#x27;s memory. She was still wearing a well-tailored women&#x27;s business suit, which made her already tall figure appear even more slender. Her neat short hair accentuated the exquisite and coldness of her features, and her icy blue eyes, with just a light glance, seemed to lower the temperature in the restaurant.</p>
<p>Those incredibly long legs, encased in pure black stockings, remained as straight and toned as ever, each step seeming to tread on one&#x27;s heart, exuding an astonishing allure. But the most crucial thing is her chest, which was originally plain and even somewhat lacking, had now become quite large. even if it can&#x27;t compare to Lin Charank, let alone Sue Chingu&#x27;s G-rank human nuclear weapon. But the perfectly proportioned C++ curves accentuated the sharp silhouette of the suit jacket, complimenting her icy demeanor and those incredibly long legs that were at least 1.2 m long. A unique sensuality brimming with an air of aeticism washes over you.</p>
<p>This is like a hexagonal warrior who originally only had two highlights, suddenly making up for the last shortcoming. This visual impact is even more shocking than Su Ching Xus pure size. Shin Yuan&#x27;s Adams Apple bobbed involuntarily. Buzz. The familiar system panel popped into my mind.</p>
<p>Target to be explored. Cold moon. Age 26. Talent: Ice Element Mastery Rank A. Realm Grand Marshall Master of the Fourth Realm.</p>
<p>Appearance rating 97 cold and elegant mature woman. Body type rating 95. Weakness is mitigated. Approaching perfection. Body details.</p>
<p>Leg length rating S. Incredibly long legs. Bus size rating A+. Slightly improved. Bus size rating C plus.</p>
<p>Promising future. Number of times zero. Overall rating 97. Host ideal type rating increased by one. Perfect S-class beauty.</p>
<p>Note the heart fluttering type rating is increased by one. But this only applies to goddesses with a rating below 98. 97 points. It&#x27;s three points higher than before. So, wasn&#x27;t our young master amazed? Seeing Shun Yuan&#x27;s eyes practically bulging out of their sockets, Leun walked over to L Yu as if showing off her most prized creation, patted her on the shoulder and explained, &quot;Lu was really hurt after you eliminated her last time.</p>
<p>After she returned, she proactively applied to the company to participate in our latest gene optimization experiment. Unexpectedly, she was the only one among those test subjects who perfectly absorbed the secondary developmental drug and did not experience any rejection reaction. Leon&#x27;s face was full of pride and smuggness. Although her cultivation level temporarily dropped by a small rank due to genetic recombination, her physical potential was developed like never before. In Su Ching Xus words, &quot;Lung Yu now has a truly flawless S-class figure.&quot; Shinuan was stunned.</p>
<p>&quot;Has Umbrella Corporation gone a little astray with its technology?&quot; Chapter 67. The long-legged woman with a rating of 97 points. Lung Yu. Just then, the systems cold notification sounded in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind again. Ding.</p>
<p>A godle target with a score of 97 or above has been detected. Special strategy mission released. The iceberg&#x27;s desire. Mission objective, increase Lung Yu&#x27;s willingness to have children to 90%. Note, the key to winning over this target is to arouse her admiration for strength and her desire to become stronger rather than increasing her affection.</p>
<p>Personal reward. One random SS level cultivation technique. Personal reward. Obtain the strategic level technology blueprint. Vitality compression storage technology.</p>
<p>Willingness to have children. Another new term. Shinuan looked at the brand new mission mode and was immediately delighted. This system understands KPIs and even implements differentiated performance evaluations and the reward is incredibly generous. SS level cultivation technique.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also energy compression and storage technology. If this thing were made, wouldn&#x27;t every martial artist in the Umbrella Corporation be able to carry an energy power bank with him? Battery anxiety is gone. Its strategic value is immeasurable system. What&#x27;s with this willingness value? Why isn&#x27;t it a favorability rating? He wondered to himself. Ding.</p>
<p>System notification. The key to winning over this target is to get her to willingly bear your offspring in exchange for greater power. Affection level is not a necessary condition. Strategy suggestion. The target has an extremely strong admiration for power and an obsessive desire for strength.</p>
<p>The host needs to prove to her that you can give her the power she has always dreamed of, the power to break through her own limits. I see. Shinuan understood instantly. This cold moon is different from those of Lin Char and Long Ying. She doesn&#x27;t pursue emotions.</p>
<p>She only pursues power. As long as it makes her stronger, she&#x27;d do anything, let alone have a baby. Having figured this out, Shin Yuans gaze towards Lyu instantly changed. It&#x27;s no longer just about admiration and amazement, but more like an experienced hunter spotting a prey that, though covered in thorns, is incredibly delicious. When Lung Yu, who was standing there, felt Shun Yuans aggressive gaze, her body tensed up almost imperceptibly for a moment, for the first time, a very subtle, complex emotion, a mixture of resistance, expectation, and a hint of humiliation appeared on her usually icy face.</p>
<p>Of course, she knew why she was standing here today. I also know how my body has been optimized to its current state. All of this is for the man in front of me. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingwa, seem to sense the subtle atmosphere. They exchanged a glance and saw a hint of relief in each other&#x27;s eyes like that of an elderly father and mother.</p>
<p>Ahem Lyu Xiaoing Wakoff twice, stepped forward and spoke to Lung Yu in an extremely gentle tone. The company has already given instructions. He paused for a moment, then offered a bait that Lyu could not refuse. Starting today, you will enjoy the same level of resource allocation as longing. Dr.</p>
<p>Pursu&#x27;s latest research and development, such as theqi and blood enhancement potion, will be prioritized for you. Your goal is no longer just a minor fourth realm Grandmaster, but a fifth realm Grandmaster or even a higher realm. A higher realm. These four words were like a flame, instantly igniting her longing for power, a desire that had been dormant for many years due to a bottleneck in her talent. She suddenly raised her head, and for the first time, a terrifying glint flashed in her usually cold eyes.</p>
<p>At 26 years old, she was at the late stage of the fourth realm of Grand Marshall Master, which was already the limit of her A-level talent. She could feel that the power within her body had stagnated for a long time. And no matter how hard she cultivated, she could hardly make any further progress. Without an extraordinary stroke of luck, she could only ever reach the fifth realm Grandmaster level in her entire life of cultivation. But now, an opportunity to reach even greater heights is right in front of us.</p>
<p>After witnessing firsthand Shin Yuans rocket-like leveling speed, and Long Yings increasingly unfathomable strength, the last bit of pride she held in her heart as an A-level genius had long since been crushed into thin air. The man before her was her only chance to break free from her shackles and reach the pinnacle of martial arts. &quot;I do.&quot; Lung, you squeezed out these three words from her throat. Her icy voice now carried an undisguised yearning for power and a trembling tone. Ding! Target lung use willingness value plus 30%.</p>
<p>Current willingness value 60%. Shin Yuan was overjoyed when he heard the notification sound. Really, to deal with a woman who admires strength, you have to use the most direct and brutal methods. Promises are empty words. Resources are not provided.</p>
<p>As long as you can make her stronger, you&#x27;ll max out not only her willingness level, but also her affection level. Good. Very good. Looking into Lung Yus eyes, which had regained their fighting spirit, Zhiao Jingua turned his head and called out to the door, &quot;Ching Xu, come in. We can begin.&quot; As soon as he finished speaking, the restaurant doors slid open silently.</p>
<p>Su Chingu walked in gracefully, wearing red high heels and carrying her silver metal briefcase. Her gaze swept around the room and when she saw a lung used completely transformed perfect figure, a look of satisfaction like an artist admiring their masterpiece flashed in her beautiful eyes behind her glasses. It seems my Venus transformation plan is working quite well, she said, adjusting her glasses with a nonchalant tone. The Venus transformation project. Shinuan was stunned.</p>
<p>That female demon, she really knows how to name things. All right, enough chitchat. Such Ching Xu walked up to the group, placed her suitcase on the table, and opened it. The box contained two bottles of dark red liquid of different concentrations, and a syringe thicker than Shun Yuan&#x27;s finger. &quot;It&#x27;s that thing again.&quot; Shin Yuans eyelids twitched violently.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a tier three chi and blood enhancement potion, and a tier 4q chi and blood enhancement potion.&quot; Such picked up one of the vials and waved it in the light. The dark red liquid flowed under the light, emitting an alluring energy fluctuation. As instructed by the company, the two doses were to be administered to Natasha and Lua, respectively. She paused, her gaze falling on Shun Yuan, a playful smile playing on her lips. Of course, this is also to ensure maximum absorption of the medicine and to enhance the relationship between you.</p>
<p>The task of administering the injection is now entrusted to you, our little hero. Holy crap, not again. Shin Yuan felt like he was now the chief injection officer of the military region. But he glanced at Natasha, who was standing beside him with her head down, avoiding his gaze and exuding an aura of submissiveness that seemed ready to be taken advantage of. She glanced again at Lyu, who though her face was cold, had eyes filled with a deep longing and anticipation for power.</p>
<p>It seems that in the end, you have to feed your own woman yourself. Chapter 68. Lung Yu steps into the peak of the fourth realm of Grand Marshall Master. No problem. I guarantee I&#x27;ll complete the task.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan immediately patted his chest and took the two syringes handed to him by Su Ching Zhu. His practiced manner made Xiao Jingwa and Li Yun, who were standing next to him, shake their heads. This kid is becoming more and more outgoing, completely unlike his former naive Taye. Who should get it first? Shin Yuan held two large syringes, deliberately figning difficulty, his gaze sweeping back and forth between Natasha and Lyu. Natasha blushed under his gaze and instinctively shrank back, her golden hair falling down to conceal the submissiveness and shyness in her eyes.</p>
<p>Now in front of Shin Yuan, she is like a completely tamed Persian cat, unable to even muster the slightest thought of resistance. Ly Yu remained aloof, arms crossed and chins slightly raised, but her long legs taught beneath her business suit, betrayed her inner turmoil. &quot;You&#x27;re the one.&quot; Shin Yuans gaze finally fell on Natasha. After all, she&#x27;s one of our own and a pregnant heroine at that, so she deserves some preferential treatment. He walked up to Natasha, picked up her fair and soft arm, and aimed the cold needle at her vein.</p>
<p>Natasha&#x27;s body trembled almost imperceptibly. She wasn&#x27;t afraid of pain. She was afraid of the man in front of her. She feared his aggressive gaze, his doineering yet gentle touch, and the fear that she would once again succumb to his terrifying physical strength, which was like that of an ancient beast. &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; Shin Yuan saw through her thoughts,, leaned down, and whispered in her ear in a voice only the two of them could hear, his warm breath brushing against her earlobe.</p>
<p>&quot;I said I would be gentler.&quot; His voice carried a soothing magic. Natasha&#x27;s tense body instantly went limp. She closed her eyes, her long eyelashes trembling, letting the cold needle pierce her skin. A gentle energy instantly surged from my arm throughout my entire body. She felt that the hidden injuries left by the backlash of her mental energy were being rapidly repaired by this energy.</p>
<p>Originally, he had already reached the mid-stage of the third realm marshall master, and his 50,000 points ofQi and blood surged upwards at this moment. 60,000 late stage of the third realm martial arts master. With just one injection, she was able to cross a threshold that would normally require a year of arduous training. This rocket-like speed of advancement was something she never dared to imagine when she was forced to perform missions day and night in the Federation. She looked at Shun Yuan with eyes full of gratitude, admiration, and an even stronger fervent love.</p>
<p>A desire to dedicate everything she had to this man. How are you feeling?&quot; Shinuan asked with a smile. &quot;I feel that not only has my strength increased, but the hidden injuries in my body have also healed a lot.&quot; Natasha said excitedly. &quot;Very good,&quot; Shin Yuan turned and walked toward his next target. A cold moon.</p>
<p>She still maintained her icy demeanor. But when Shin Yuan walked up to her, he could still detect a hint of nervousness and anticipation in her cold eyes. &quot;Your turn, ice queen.&quot; Lung Yu didn&#x27;t speak, but silently unbuttoned her suit jacket and stretched out her arm. Her arms, unlike Lynchurance, were firm and muscular. He aimed the needle of the fourth tier chi and blood enhancement potion at Lung Yus blue veins.</p>
<p>&quot;It might hurt a little, so please bear with it,&quot; he kindly advised. Lung Yu snorted coldly, turned her head away, and gave an expression that said, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen it all before.&quot; Shin Yuan chuckled mischievously, said, &quot;No more nonsense.&quot; and forcefully pushed all the medicine in. Lung, you let out a suppressed groan, her body trembling violently. An energy several times more violent than what Natasha had felt before exploded within her body. Tiny beads of blood even seeped from the surface of her skin.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s hands didn&#x27;t stop moving. The energy within Lung Yus body is frantically surging through her meridians and transforming her body in an almost savage manner. Her health and vitality were skyrocketing at a rate even more terrifying than Natasha&#x27;s. 400,000 450,000. In the end, it steadily stopped at the terrifying number of 450,000, just one step away from becoming a grandmaster of the fifth realm.</p>
<p>Boom! A wave of icy cold air, several times stronger than the one Natasha had just unleashed, emanated from Lung Yu&#x27;s body. All the glassear in the room buzzed and rattled under the impact of the shock wave. As the aftershocks of the energy dissipate, Lyu opened her eyes, looking at her hands and feeling the newfound surging power within her. A look of ecstasy and awe appeared on her perpetually icy, beautiful face. My health and mana have increased by 50,000 points.</p>
<p>Peak of the fourth realm, Grand Marshall Master. She&#x27;s been stuck at this bottleneck for two whole years. No matter how hard she trained or how desperately she tried, she couldn&#x27;t break through that damned barrier. But now just one injection has allowed her to break through. She raised her head and looked at Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Those usually cold eyes were now burning with two raging flames. Shin Yuan grinned from ear to ear as he listened to the notification in his mind. All right, now that your new teammates are in place. Lean looked at the large family before her. Each member possessing both strength and stunning beauty.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat and announced the next battle plan. From today onwards, L Yu, you will also join Shin Yuans daily training. You and Ling team up to conduct the most intense real combat training against him. We must push his combat abilities to their limit before the battle of geniuses begins. This order surprised both Ling and Lyu, two people teaming up to practice on one.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was training against Shun Yuan, a novice in the mid-stage of the third realm. Isn&#x27;t this bullying? But when they saw Shun Yuan&#x27;s strange expression, not only was he not afraid, but he looked expectant. Their doubts instantly turned into a competitive spirit, especially L Yu. She now desperately wants to prove her worth in front of this man. No problem can.</p>
<p>The two goddesses agreed in unison. One gaze was cold, the other resolute. Both eyes fell upon Shun Yuan simultaneously, igniting a fighting spirit. Lung, you couldn&#x27;t wait to see just how capable this man, who is so highly regarded by the company&#x27;s hidden big boss, really was. Chapter 69.</p>
<p>Cold Moon&#x27;s conquest values are instantly maxed out, and the young countest arrives. In the days that followed, Shin Yuan&#x27;s hellish training underwent another epic upgrade. His powerful screams echoed in the training room every day. What? Longing, are you a sore loser? We agreed on a one-on-one fight. Why did you call for backup? Bang.</p>
<p>Longing unleashed a whip kick imbued with terrifying energy, tearing through the air and sending him flying through the air. Before he even landed, a chilling aura swept in from the other side, silently piercing his back. It was Lung Yu&#x27;s A-level talent. Ice element control. She actually condensed her energy into an incomparably sharp ice sword.</p>
<p>Holy crap, Lyu, you icyfaced jerk. You&#x27;re serious? Shinuan was so frightened that his scalp tingled. He twisted his waist in midair and narrowly avoided the fatal blow in an extremely awkward posture before crashing heavily to the ground. On the battlefield, no one follows the rules. Longing and Lung Yu, one on the left and one on the right, sandwiched him in the middle.</p>
<p>Two pairs of legs, different in style but equally straight and long, both exuding explosive power, made Shin Yuan dizzy under the lights. At this moment, in his eyes, these were not legs at all, but two deadly scissors that could take his life at any moment. Again, without a word, the two goddesses launched their attacks simultaneously. Once again, after training, the half-dead Shin Yuan will be dragged like a dead dog into the medicinal bath that Su Chingu has prepared by the murderous looking Ling and the icy-faced L Yu. But today, he is no longer alone in this bathtub with its eerie purple glow.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s nose was filled with two different yet equally intoxicating feminine fragrances. He felt as if he were in heaven. The power of the dragon&#x27;s soul and his vital energy mixed with the blood of the dragon completed one cycle after another within their bodies. Lung Yu stared in shock at this unbelievable scene. Shin Yuan and Ly Yings vital energy is still increasing.</p>
<p>Especially Shun Yuan, whose original Yuan Chi fluctuations were only at the mid-stage of the third realm martial artist, became more condensed and purer after each cultivation session. She could even sense a faint yet incredibly noble golden dragon aura emanating from Shan Yuan&#x27;s vital energy, aura that made her heart tremble. Is this the secret of dragon energy nourishment and the dragon soul battle body? Lung Yu looked at the man with his eyes closed, whose internal energy was constantly being refined. She thought of her own bottleneck at the peak of the fourth realm, which had stagnated for two whole years, and she was unable to break through. She thought of the legendary five realms grandmaster realm, which could double one&#x27;s lifespan and allow one to look down upon all living beings.</p>
<p>If I also, could I, like Longing, easily reach that dreamlike realm? Once this thought arose, it spread like wildfire, instantly taking over her entire mind. Ding! Target cold moon&#x27;s willpower value plus 10%. Current progress 90%. It&#x27;s done. Shinyuan heard the notification sound in his mind and was overjoyed.</p>
<p>He also secretly approached the ice queen. Lung Yus icy face, already flushed with embarrassment, turned even redder, but she forced herself to remain calm and turned her head away. Meanwhile, Longing shot him a cold gaze from the other side, and her jade-like foot underwater stomped hard on his calf without any politeness. Shinuan&#x27;s face turned red, despicable. Time flew by amidst this painful yet exhilarating hellish training.</p>
<p>Three days have passed in the blink of an eye. On the border of Donghai City, there is a secluded private helellipad. A private jet, entirely black with a design full of gothic retro aesthetics and adorned with a lifelike crimson rose totem, landed silently and smoothly like an elegant black swan. The hatch opened. A long, straight, perfectly sculpted leg encased in black lace stocking stepped out of the cabin first.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, a stunningly beautiful woman dressed in a medieval noble court dress with dazzling platinum blonde hair casually draped over her shoulders and wearing an exquisite silver mask that revealed only a pair of deep, captivating violet eyes and fiery red lips, slowly descended the gang way. Every move she made exuded an innate nobility, elegance, and a suffocating sense of oppression. She is countest of the blood rose, Akasha von Rothschild. Behind her followed four equally tall guards dressed in black tail coats and wearing white masks, exuding a cold, murderous aura like the most loyal knights. Each of these four is a genuine grand marshall master of the fourth realm.</p>
<p>Welcome, your excellency, the countest. Natasha, who had been waiting on the tarmac for a long time, immediately stepped forward, knelt on one knee, and greeted her new boss with utmost humility. Arise, my poor black widow. Akasha&#x27;s voice is like that of a top quality cello, deep, melodious, yet carrying the unique majesty of someone in a superior position. She walked up to Natasha, extended her slender hand clad in a black lace glove, and gently lifted Natasha&#x27;s chin.</p>
<p>When she saw that Natasha&#x27;s face, though beautiful, still held a trace of weariness and fear deep in her eyes, a hint of undisguised contempt flashed in her own violet eyes. It seems the rumors are true. Our Federation&#x27;s top ace agent was actually outmaneuvered by a mere brat from the Dragon Sea Empire on his own turf. Natasha&#x27;s body stiffened, her fingernails digging deeply into her palms. But she dared not show the slightest dissatisfaction on her face.</p>
<p>Your excellency is too kind. It is my skill that is inferior. Are you less skilled than others? Akasha released Natasha&#x27;s chin, turned around, and looked at the brightly lit, bustling city in the distance, her eyes revealing absolute confidence and greed. No man in this world can resist the allure of the Rothschild family. That so-called S-rank flame dragon bloodline will soon become my most loyal blood slave.</p>
<p>A cruel yet excited smile curved her lips and the real man they hid. He will become the perfect stepping stone for me. Akasha von Rothschild to reach the pinnacle of family power. Chapter 70. Queen of the go forum.</p>
<p>Muchinga the most exclusive private club in Donghai city located at top the clouds. This is a true den of iniquity. A cloud top world that ordinary people can never set foot in their entire lives. Tonight, this place has been booked by Zhao E, the son of the richest man in Dong Hai, for an extremely luxurious private banquet. On the exclusive helipad at the entrance of the club, rows of extravagantly designed, roaring top-of-the-line hover cars are like lurking beasts, each representing a distinguished family.</p>
<p>The security personnel, dressed in black suits and with stern expressions, were stationed every three steps and centuries every five steps. Anyone without an invitation was not even allowed to approach. Inside the banquet hall, crystal chandeliers hung from the dome, illuminating the entire hall as if it were daytime. Melodious classical music flowed in the air, and well-dressed men and women holding champagne glasses move through the crowd with polite yet aloof smiles on their faces. Business tycoons, rising political stars, popular singers and actresses, and hot top models.</p>
<p>Almost all the elements of Donghai City&#x27;s high society are condensed into this small space. However, the atmosphere in the most central and prestigious booth area of the banquet hall seems somewhat strange. Shinfong and Sun Wu, two members of the four young masters of the East China Sea, were surrounded by at least two or three hot, scantily clad young female celebrities like stars around the moon. They would pinch one&#x27;s thigh at times and bring their wine glasses to another&#x27;s red lips at other times, eliciting bursts of giggles as they played happily. Only Shun Yuan, who sat in the main seat, was surrounded by empty space, forming an eerie vacuum.</p>
<p>Behind him, Longing stood quietly like a perfect ice sculpture. Today, she changed out of her usual combat uniform and put on a black bodycon dress that Su Chinghu had kindly provided. The clothes seemed tailor made for her, perfectly outlining her flawless figure, which was free of any excess fat and full of strength and athleticism. Her straight, long legs, firm, perky buttocks, and the faint outline of her abs on her flat stomach all showcased the unique charm of a future female warrior. But her strikingly beautiful face with its serious expression made any man who tried to approach her hesitate from 3 m away.</p>
<p>Shinuan held his wine glass, feeling somewhat bored. It&#x27;s been almost an hour and apart from seeing Chin Fong and Sun Wu flirting with a bunch of ordinary women, he hasn&#x27;t even caught a glimpse of the countess. He took a sip of his drink and emboldened by the alcohol, turned his head, and reached out to pull the icy beauty behind him into his arms. Instructor Long stopped standing there like a doorman. Sit down and have a drink with me.</p>
<p>His voice was low and teasing. Longing remained expressionless, not even lifting her eyelids. But just as Shun Yuan&#x27;s restless hand was about to touch her waist, her icy voice warned. I see the marks on your face have faded, but your skin is itchy again. Or do you want to experience the feeling of crying and begging for mercy again? In an instant, Shin Yuan was reminded of the miserable scene last night in the medicine bath house when he tried to bully this woman, but was met with retaliation.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan reluctantly withdrew his hand, not daring to act rashly again. This woman is getting more and more difficult to deal with. Not far away, Li Yun and Xiao Jingua, disguised as an ordinary wealthy couple, were elegantly sipping red wine. Seeing Shun Yuan&#x27;s humiliated state in front of Ling, Li Yun couldn&#x27;t help but smile. She used her mental power to transmit her thoughts to Shun Yuan.</p>
<p>Serves you right. Serves you right for flirting around. Let me tell you, don&#x27;t rush into provoking Longing. She&#x27;s a walking jealous pot now. Your mission is to fish, not to choose a concubine.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the whole place. That countest could appear at any moment. Shinuan pursed his lips, inwardly grumbling. The surrounding guests, seeing this strange scene at the head of the table, also began to discuss it amongst themselves. Who exactly is that young man? How come he&#x27;s sitting in Young Master Zhaos reserved seat? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Judging from the respectful attitude of Young Master Chin and Young Master Sun towards him, he must be someone important. But how come such an important person doesn&#x27;t have a single female companion? He only has a female bodyguard who is unbelievably beautiful but as cold as ice. You don&#x27;t know anything. This is called prestige. The higher the rank of a big shot, the more low-key and mysterious they are.</p>
<p>Look at his female bodyguard. Although she&#x27;s cold, her figure and aura are unmatched by any celebrity or model. These whispers were not loud, but they all reached Shun Yuans ears clearly. He remained outwardly calm, but inwardly he was secretly delighted. Just then, the lights in the banquet hall suddenly dimmed and a spotlight shone on the entrance.</p>
<p>A host in a tuxedo holding a microphone announced loudly in an extremely excited tone. Distinguished guests, let us welcome our host tonight, the true heir of Donghai City, Zhao E, the eldest son of the Zhao family, with the warmest applause. Before he finished speaking, thunderous applause and cheers erupted instantly. The enormous gilded doors of the banquet hall slowly opened. Zoey was still dressed in his usual extremely flamboyant style, wearing a bright pink suit, his hair sllicked back, an expensive Cuban cigar dangling from his lips, and his signature cynical smile on his face.</p>
<p>His appearance instantly brought the atmosphere of the entire banquet to its climax. When Shin Fong and Sun Wu saw Shin Yuan get the short end of the stick in front of Ling, they both revealed a knowing, wicked smile. They dared not say a word in front of Ling. So they could only tease their female companions even more enthusiastically, using this silent action to mock their Yuan Gi, who had just suffered a setback. Shiny Yuan ignored his two troublesome friends.</p>
<p>He was highly focused, his sharp eyes scanning the entire scene like radar. This lavish banquet was merely a carefully arranged stage. The real hunt has not yet begun. He was both excited and nervous. Just what kind of stunning beauty was the legendary blood rose countest? Just as Shun Yuan was fully focused, waiting for his prey to take the bait, the banquet hall doors were pushed open again.</p>
<p>This time, Zoey was no longer accompanied by his cronies. Instead, she is an exceptionally beautiful woman with outstanding temperament and a glamorous and fashionable appearance. Her appearance was like the bright moon in the night, instantly attracting everyone&#x27;s attention. That face was none other than Muing Shiwa, the most popular pop diva in the Dragon Sea Empire with fans all over the world. Chapter 71.</p>
<p>The direction seems wrong. Mu Ching Shua&#x27;s appearance was like a bomb dropped into a calm lake, instantly igniting the entire banquet hall. She wore a custom-made silver starry gown adorned with countless tiny diamonds that refracted brilliant light as she moved as if she were draped in an entire galaxy. The long dress clung to her body, outlining her breathtaking curves. Her stunningly beautiful face, flawless from every angle, wore only light makeup.</p>
<p>Yet, it made all the heavily madeup female celebrities present pale in comparison. She is not only a global pop diva, but also comes from a family of similar social standing to Zhao. Both belonging to the most elite aeryses in the empire. Her appearance elevated the already lavish banquet to an even higher level. Zhao Ei clearly enjoyed the feeling of being the center of attention.</p>
<p>He glanced around smugly, then stroed over to Shun Yuan, nudged him with his elbow, and whispered with a wink, &quot;Bro, how&#x27;s it going? I went through a lot of trouble to poach her from her packed schedule.&quot; He gestured with his lip towards Muing Shiua, who was surrounded by a group of people, and smiling sweetly, his voice full of pride. Muing Shiua is a top tier aerys with a family background no less impressive than mine. Most importantly, this girl has read countless hero novels since childhood and idolizes young heroes who rise through the ranks on their own merits. Winning her over would definitely be a win-win situation. Shinyuan felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>He secretly glanced behind him out of the corner of his eye. Ly Yings already cold and pretty face was now covered in frost, and the temperature of the air around her seemed to drop several degrees. Brother, are you helping me or hurting me? Shiny Yuan lowered his voice, practically squeezing out those words through clenched teeth. The real target hasn&#x27;t even shown up yet. And you want me to pick up girls in front of longing? Do you want me to die even faster? You don&#x27;t know anything.</p>
<p>Zhao e patted his shoulder with a look of utter exasperation, his eyes filled with speechless frustration. Your talent is such a waste. He pointed to himself, then to Shun Yuan, his face contorted with grief and indignation. If you had my level of awareness, you&#x27;d have a whole platoon of kids by now. What kind of insane logic is this? Shinuan felt that his brain couldn&#x27;t keep up with the thought process of these top tier second generation kids.</p>
<p>Just as the two were whispering to each other, Mu Chingshi gracefully shook off the young men who were fawning over her. And with light steps, she took the initiative to walk towards Shinuan. She first turned to Shin Yuan, revealing a sweet smile capable of melting ice and snow. Her voice was as clear and melodious as a nightingale song. You must be Mr.</p>
<p>Shinuan. I often hear Zhoi mention you, saying that you are a very young and very powerful martial artist. Her beautiful eyes darted around, carrying a perfectly measured curiosity, landing on Longing behind Shin Yuan before quickly looking away as if it were just a casual glance. I just saw the two of you whispering to each other. Were you talking about me? Her tone carried a hint of girish coetishness, which combined with her stunningly beautiful face made it impossible for anyone to feel the slightest bit of disgust.</p>
<p>Looking at the woman in front of him, whose looks, temperament, family background, and conversation were all top-notch, Shinuan couldn&#x27;t help but feel a stirring in his heart. Since we&#x27;re just killing time anyway, and the countest hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to test the waters with this diva first. Zhao E frantically winked at Shun Yuan, his lips moving silently. Go up there. Go up there now.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be a coward. Shin Yuan secretly glanced at Longing behind him out of the corner of his eye. He noticed that although Longing was still standing there expressionless, her icy phoenix eyes were noticeably colder than before, as if to say, &quot;You dare.&quot; On one side is a top tier goddess who&#x27;s practically offering herself up along with the potential for generous system rewards. On the other side is a jealous icy female warrior behind her, ready to explode at any moment. This multiplechoice question is a bit difficult.</p>
<p>Only children make choices. I want them all. Just as Shun Yuan hesitated about how to speak, Muing Shiwa, seeing that he remained silent, assumed he was shy, and once again extended her slender, delicate hand, as white as mutton fat jade, and said with a smile, &quot;If you don&#x27;t mind, could we get to know each other formally? I&#x27;ve always been very interested in true heroes. Her fingertips almost touched the back of Shun Yuans hand. In the end, Shin Yuan still reached out his hand.</p>
<p>Underh Zho Yis approving gaze and Long Yings cold stare behind him. He gently grasped Mu Chingua&#x27;s soft, boneless hand. It has a delicate, warm feel and a slight coolness to the touch. My name is Shin Yuan. He smiled slightly, revealing a set of pearly white teeth, a touch of just the right amount of shyness on his face.</p>
<p>acting, but not much. He&#x27;s just an insignificant martial artist, hardly a hero. He just turned 18 this year. 18 years old. Mu Shing Shiwa&#x27;s beautiful almond shaped eyes widened instantly, a stunning light flashing within them.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t help but gasp in surprise. An 18-year-old martial artist at the third realm, Mr. Shun, you&#x27;re being far too modest. Born into a top tier wealthy family, she grew up surrounded by such influences and naturally understood what an 18-year-old third realm martial artist meant in this era. That&#x27;s not just a genius.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a prodigy of being capable of shaking the entire empire. The moment their bodies touched, the familiar golden panel popped up in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. Ding. A godle target with a score of 98 or higher has been detected. Special strategy mission issued.</p>
<p>The Queen&#x27;s Worship. Target Muing Shiaua. Age 22. Talent: Heavenly Voice Grade A special category. Realm none.</p>
<p>Appearance rating 98. Stunningly beautiful. Body proportions score 96. Golden ratio. Body details bus size 36D plus.</p>
<p>Bus size A. Leg size A plus. Status pure single. Special bonus hosts heart fluttering type heavenly voice plus one. Overall rating 98.</p>
<p>God tier. Mission objective. Increase the target mood Ching Shua&#x27;s worship value towards the host to 90%. Worship value. The degree of hero worship and admiration the target has for the host.</p>
<p>The more the host matches the targets heroic fantasy, the higher the value. Current worship level 30%. Personal reward, one chance to upgrade your S-rank bloodline. Other rewards, creativity in the cultural and artistic fields of Liao will be permanently increased by 30%. What? Shinuan&#x27;s heart pounded wildly.</p>
<p>Another stunning beauty with a score of 98. And this reward is amazing. An opportunity to upgrade his S-rank bloodline. This is something that could cause a qualitative change in his strength. And there&#x27;s that reward, a 30% increase in cultural and artistic creativity.</p>
<p>If this is completed, then everyone will probably be an artist, able to compose poems, write music, and paint. Shinyuan was excited for less than half a second when a sudden thought struck him. Wait, something&#x27;s not right. This is a world where martial arts flourish, and cuttingedge technology is everywhere. There&#x27;s also a covetous federation outside.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the use of having an average number of artists per capita? When the enemy attacks, should we send a poet to verbally abuse their commander to death or send a dancer to perform a war dance to embarrass the enemy to death? This reward seems completely unreliable. Chapter 72. Franked talent. The empress is shocked. Mr.</p>
<p>Shinuan, you must have awakened an extremely powerful talent, right? Is it Srank or the legendary SS rank? Mu Ching Shuiwa&#x27;s curiosity was completely ignited, and she naturally sat down next to Shun Yuan, her skirt spreading out like moonlight. Her large almond-shaped eyes stared at him intently, filled with a searching light, as if trying to see right through him. The young men around them were practically green with envy as they watched their goddess being so proactive with an unknown nobody. Some people gripped their wine glasses so tightly their knuckles turned white while others muttered curses under their breath. Their eyes filled with jealousy and hostility.</p>
<p>But when they saw the fierce expressions on the faces of Zhao ei Chin Foam and Sun Wu beside them as if to say, &quot;Who dares to come up and try?&quot; They all reluctantly withdrew their gazes and could only swallow their anger. Cough, cough. Shinuan felt a little embarrassed by her intense gaze. He shook his head with faint melancholy and sighed softly. &quot;Miss Mu, you flatter me.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have any extraordinary talent.&quot; He paused, then slowly said in a tone tinged with self-mockery. &quot;My talent is only the lowest level, Fgrade, and its name is quite ordinary. Get stronger through training.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; This answer completely surprised her. Frank lower than my talent level. How is that possible? How could a useless person with F-level talent reach the level of a third realm martial artist at the age of 18? What incredible effort and sweat must have been poured into this? What unwavering willpower must have been required? This is no longer a story of genius.</p>
<p>This is the epic story of an ordinary person who through his own blood and sweat defied fate and rose to become a god. In an instant, an image automatically appeared in Mu Chingshua&#x27;s mind. A lonely boy endures hellish aestheticism day after day, year after year, amidst the ridicule and scorn of countless people. On the training field, sweat soaked through his clothes, dripping onto the ground and instantly evaporating on his fists. New wounds overlapped with old ones and blood stained the sandbags red, but his dark eyes never wavered in the slightest.</p>
<p>With his mortal body, he embarked on the most difficult yet greatest path to godhood. Ding. Target Mu Chingshi&#x27;s admiration value plus 20%. Current progress 50%. This is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Much gaze towards Shinuan changed. What started as curiosity and appreciation has transformed into heartfelt deep respect and admiration. You must have put in unimaginable effort, right? Her voice trembled slightly with heartache, as if all the pain had fallen on her own shoulders. Meeting her adoring gaze, Shin Yuan chuckled inwardly, but his face adopted a profound expression as he gazed up at the ceiling at a 45°ree angle. In an extremely weathered and lonely tone, he slowly spoke.</p>
<p>The path of martial arts is inherently solitary. Talent determines the starting point, but what ultimately determines the destination is always one&#x27;s own will. For me, only sweat and blood never lie. These sophisticated words instantly stunned Muing Shiua. But Longing, standing behind him, couldn&#x27;t help but twitch her lips as she listened and almost couldn&#x27;t resist kicking him on the spot.</p>
<p>Sweat? Is that sweat from training? Blood? Was it the blood from his nose that he and Lyu had beaten up together? Shameless, perverted, big liar. Longing felt that the vital energy in her body had become somewhat unstable because of this shameless man. Her feet, clad in sturdy military boots, had her toes unconsciously curling up inside, gripping the Sauls tightly. She really wanted to get back to the training room right now. She wanted to double her training.</p>
<p>Muching was completely moved by Shun Yuan&#x27;s lonely heroic appearance. Her eyes reened as she listened, feeling that the man in front of her was simply a walking inspirational epic. His lonely yet resolute aura caused her inner fantasies about heroes, a girlish fantasy, and her overflowing maternal instincts to erupt completely at that moment. Ding. Target Mu Ching Shu&#x27;s worship value plus 10%.</p>
<p>Current worship value 60%. What? It&#x27;s already 60%. Shinuan was overjoyed. It seemed this girl was even easier to fool than he had imagined. Just as the atmosphere at the banquet became somewhat delicate due to the conversation between Mu Ching Shiu and Shin Yuanha, he suddenly walked to the center of the stage, took the microphone from the host, cleared his throat, and announced loudly in an extremely arrogant tone.</p>
<p>Everyone, quiet down. Tonight, I want to introduce you all to someone I, Zhaoi, have just recognized as a good brother, Shinuan. He paused, his gaze sweeping across the entire room, then shouted in a tone that could be heard by everyone, filled with doineering power and protectiveness. From this day forward, his business is my business. Anyone who dares to disrespect my brother is disrespecting me.</p>
<p>Zoe, wow. The entire audience erupted in uproar. All eyes were immediately focused on Shin Yuan. Zhao Yis words carried immense weight. This is tantamount to announcing to the entire upper class of Donghai city that Shin Yuan is someoneho ei protecting.</p>
<p>With just one sentence, Shun Yuan status was elevated to the very top among the younger generation in Donghai City. Countless gazes filled with inquiry, awe, and envy were focused on Shin Yuan. They were all wondering what kind of person this young man was that Zhao E had introduced so solemnly. Shin Yuan, who was the focus of attention, seemed completely unaffected and continued to chat happily with the Empress Mu Chingua beside him. Mr.</p>
<p>Shan, a curious glint shown in Mu Chingshuas beautiful eyes as she softly asked, &quot;What are the aspirations of a hero like you for the future?&quot; This question gave Shinuan pause for thought. &quot;The time has come to show my heroism.&quot; He didn&#x27;t answer immediately. Instead, he picked up his wine glass, took a small sip, and then turned his head to look at Mu Shing Shuas stunningly beautiful face, which was so close to his with a half- joking, half-s serious gaze. My ambition is actually very simple. He grinned, revealing a set of white teeth.</p>
<p>His voice wasn&#x27;t loud, but it clearly reached Mu Chingshi&#x27;s ears. I want to marry several wives like Miss Mu, beautiful, kind-hearted, and with lovely voices, and have a whole bunch of adorable children. Finally, I&#x27;ll dedicate all my strength to protecting them, ensuring they suffer not the slightest harm. These blunt, almost rude words made Mu Chingshus heart skip a beat, and two beautiful blushes instantly rose on her cheeks. She had never heard of such a unique ambition.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; she asked, stammering slightly. &quot;With your talent and ability, don&#x27;t you want to go to a broader stage, make achievements, and leave your name in history?&quot; &quot;Of course, I&#x27;ll go.&quot; Shun Yuans eyes instantly sharpened like knives, and the powerful aura of a Third Realm martial artist emanating from him was released without reservation. 20 days later, I will go to the capital for the Imperial Pride Battle. He looked into Mu Ching Shius beautiful eyes, which were slightly wide with shock and said, word by word, in a doineering tone that seemed to look down upon the world, &quot;I will trample all so-called geniuses under my feet. I will let the entire empire know that even F-level talent can reach the top.</p>
<p>That powerful confidence and doineering aura emanating from his very bones struck Mu Chingshua&#x27;s heart like a heavy hammer, making her tremble with fear. This This is the true hero in her heart. Unafraid of power or destiny, they go against the tide, challenging the gods with their mortal bodies. Ding. Target Mu Chingshu&#x27;s worship value plus 10%.</p>
<p>Current worship value 70%. longing. My feet suddenly feel really itchy. Chapter 73. The Empress falls for her and promises to marry her on the spot.</p>
<p>He gazed into Mood Ching Shua&#x27;s watery eyes and brought the topic back to the present. So, after I become famous throughout the empire, I will come back to marry you. Will you be willing to marry me then? This question, like a pebble thrown into a calm lake, instantly stirred up a thousand waves in Mu Ching Shuas heart. marry him to become the wife of this man who will one day be famous throughout the empire to become the person he said he would spend his whole life protecting. This idea is fatally tempting to any woman.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is especially true for a girl like Mu Ching Shiua who has had a hero complex since childhood. She felt her cheeks burning hot and her heart was pounding uncontrollably, almost jumping out of her throat. All the sounds around seemed to disappear at that moment. In her world, there was only the man in front of her and his eyes as black as ink that seemed to see through everything. How should she answer? Reasonz told her that she should be reserved and refused tactfully.</p>
<p>After all, they had only met for the first time today, and it would be too unladylike for him to agree so quickly. But deep within her heart, a voice was screaming wildly. Say yes. Say yes now. You&#x27;ll miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>This is a living, breathing male protagonist straight out of an epic tale. After a brief yet incredibly long silence and hesitation, Muing Shua took a deep breath as if she had used up all her strength, she looked at Shun Yuan, whose almond shaped eyes, which always carried a hint of coldness and aloofness, were now filled with an unprecedented seriousness and determination. She nodded heavily, as if possessed. Then in a voice as soft as a mosquito&#x27;s buzz yet incredibly clear, she responded. If you can truly become famous throughout the empire and are still genuinely willing to marry me, I will marry.</p>
<p>Boom. Although the three words were not spoken loudly, they were like a bolt from the blue to the ears of the people who were eavesdropping nearby. Puff dash. Not far away, Ziao Jingwa, who was holding a wine glass and pretending to chat and laugh with a business tycoon, suddenly spat out a mouthful of top quality red wine worth millions, spraying it all over the face of the balding tycoon opposite him. Cough, cough, cough.</p>
<p>Leon was also startled by this sudden turn of events and choked, covering her mouth and coughing violently. Her pretty face, which always carried a hint of charm and composure, was filled with two big words, &quot;What is wrong?&quot; The two looked at each other and saw the same shock and speechlessness in each other&#x27;s eyes. Good heavens, I sent you fishing. What the hell are you doing? You&#x27;ve taken the most beautiful and valuable koi from the fish pond and brought it home as your wife. Zhao Ein Foam and Sun Wu who were closest to the camera were completely petrified.</p>
<p>Their mouth agape and their eyes practically popping out of their sockets. The cigar inho Yis hand fell to the ground with a thud, and he rubbed his eyes in disbelief. Holy crap, they&#x27;ve already won. The Empress of the Empire, a top tier Aerys, the apple of the Moo family&#x27;s eye, was won over by her own brother with just a few words. And it was a public engagement.</p>
<p>This is too fantastical. The way he looked at Shun Yuan instantly changed from, &quot;Brother, you&#x27;re not good enough to brother Yuan, you&#x27;re like my own brother.&quot; A fanatical admiration. But they weren&#x27;t the ones who reacted the most. Instead, it was longing sitting behind Shinuan. An invisible chill suddenly spread out from her center.</p>
<p>She remained standing upright, her posture as perfect as a textbook example. She didn&#x27;t even look at Shun Yuan, but stared blankly ahead. Yet, the temperature in her Phoenix eyes was enough to turn the entire banquet hall into an ice cellar. Just as the atmosphere in the banquet hall became incredibly strange and heated because of this sudden scene, the banquet gradually came to an end. The guests began to leave in twos and threes, but Shun Yuan&#x27;s true target, the mysterious Countess of Blood Rose, never appeared.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on? Could the intelligence be wrong? Lean&#x27;s somewhat anxious voice came through the communication channel. Was she not coming? Shinuan also felt that something was wrong. He&#x27;s been acting for so long. His throat is almost dry, and the bait has almost been eaten up by the mermaid muing Shiwa. But where is that legendary deep sea shark? If this continues, Longing, this walking vinegar jar, is afraid she&#x27;s really going to explode on the spot.</p>
<p>He glanced at Mood Ching Shua beside him, who was still in the excitement and shyness of making their engagement and looking at him with starry eyes, and then at Longing behind him, who was practically a human-shaped cooling machine. He felt like he had a splitting headache. &quot;Um, Miss Mu, Mr. Zhao, I need to go to the restroom first.&quot; Shinuan made up a lame excuse, stood up, and prepared to temporarily escape this chaotic scene and sort out his disordered thoughts. I&#x27;ll go with you.</p>
<p>Muching stood up almost instinctively, then realized her mistake and blushed as she added, &quot;I&#x27;ll wait for you outside.&quot; No sooner had he finished speaking than a cold voice rang out, &quot;I&#x27;ll go, too.&quot; Longing also came over and spoke concisely, &quot;Shinuan, I just went to the bathroom. Is it really that big of a deal? One of you wants to wait at the entrance and the other wants to go inside. Right. Just as the two women were about to clash over who could get closer to the toilet door, Zoe quickly stepped in to smooth things over. Oh, sister-in-law, please sit down.</p>
<p>I just remembered my dad asked me to ask about your concert plans for the second half of the year. He shoved Mu Chingshua back into her seat, then winked at Shun Yuan. Brother Yuan, hurry back. We&#x27;re waiting for you. As if granted a pardon, Shin Yuan practically fled, walking alone towards the corridor outside the banquet hall under the watchful eyes of his two bodyguards.</p>
<p>The noisy music and voices were completely shut out by the heavy soundproof door, and the whole world instantly became quiet. Chapter 74. The countess&#x27;s conquest mission. Shinyuan leaned against the cold wall and let out a long sigh. Dealing with women can sometimes be more tiring than fighting a fifth tier star beast.</p>
<p>He was just about to light a cigarette to relax his tense nerves when a glamorous black skirt suddenly appeared from around the corner. Shin Yuan subconsciously looked up and bumped right into a woman walking towards him. H a soft yet surprisingly elastic sensation came over him accompanied by a rich and exotic fragrance that instantly entered his nostrils. Shin Yuan felt as if he had bumped into a ball of top quality velvet and the soft force bounced him back two steps. He studied himself immediately and was about to apologize when his gaze was instantly drawn to the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>She wore a gorgeous vintage style black velvet gown with a low neckline, revealing a patch of fair, delicate skin and a bottomless astonishing. The dress was cinched tightly at the waist, perfectly outlining her slender waist and the exaggerated curves of her hips, which resembled those of a ripe peach. The worst part is that the long skirt has a slit on the side that goes all the way up to the top of the thigh. As she moved, her full, straight, and perfectly shaped legs encased in exquisite black lace stockings were glimpsed from time to time, exuding a mature, forbidden, and deadly allure. She wore an exquisitely crafted silver mask that covered the upper half of her face, revealing only her fiery red lips and her perfectly sculpted work of art chin.</p>
<p>This is a top tier beauty who can drive any man crazy just by looking at the lower half of her face and her figure. Just as Shin Yuan was sizing her up, the instant she appeared, a blood red that representing extreme danger suddenly lit up on the screen of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters command center, emitting a piercing alarm. Warning, warning. Extremely high energy level detected. Target level Grandmaster of the Fifth Realm.</p>
<p>The target has been spotted right in the corridor outside the banquet hall. Inside the banquet hall, Ling, who was about to get up and go out to see what was going on, suddenly felt every hair on her body stand on end. A sense of impending doom as if she were being targeted by a top predator, instantly enveloped her entire body. She suddenly looked up towards the corridor, and her usually cold Phoenix eyes shrank to the size of dangerous needles. At that moment, the main character has finally arrived.</p>
<p>In the corridor, the masked woman, instead of getting angry when Shun Yuan bumped into her, gracefully regained her balance and adjusted her mask. She spoke slowly in a magnetic tone that was both languid and noble, yet full of exotic charm. The sound was like the finest cello playing in an ancient castle at midnight. Each note seemingly capable of captivating the soul. Oh, young sir, you&#x27;re in too much of a hurry.</p>
<p>Her gaze fell on Shun Yuans handsome face, and the eyes beneath the mask seemed to be electrifying. &quot;Are you in a hurry to see someone you love?&quot; Shin yuan sneered inwardly. &quot;Damn it, it&#x27;s finally here.&quot; After acting for half a day, my throat was practically, but I finally got to see this big fish. On the surface, he remained calm, his face displaying just the right amount of apology and amazement. He released her hand and said politely, &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry, beautiful lady.</p>
<p>I was too rash.&quot; The woman glanced at the still brightly lit banquet hall behind him, which was gradually emptying out and sighed with figned regret. &quot;Looks like I&#x27;m too late. The party&#x27;s already over.&quot; Then she turned her gaze back to Shun Yuan. Her languid tone carrying an undisguised allure. However, with a handsome man like you by my side, anywhere can be the starting point for a party.</p>
<p>She took a step forward, her voluuptuous and alluring body slowly pressing closer to Shun Yuan. The peculiar fragrance, a mixture of roses and blood, growing ever stronger. I wonder if I have the honor of inviting you to share a drink. It&#x27;s here. A blatant invitation.</p>
<p>Shinuan felt his heart skip a beat. He suppressed his excitement, put on a perfect gentlemanly smile, bowed slightly, and performed an impeccable aristocratic etiquette. It is my honor to spend the evening with such a charming lady as you. He looked up at the silver mask and asked, &quot;May I ask how I should address you?&quot; The woman&#x27;s fiery red lips curled slightly into a captivating arc. She extended her slender hand clad in a black lace glove.</p>
<p>Her voice languid yet full of mystery. Just call me Lilith. Lilith? The witch from mythology who tempted Adam. This woman really knows how to play the game. Shun Yuan mentally complained, then took her soft, boneless hand in his grasp, preparing to perform a handkissing ceremony according to standard aristocratic etiquette.</p>
<p>However, the moment his fingertips touched that thin lace glove, a god-level target has been detected. Target: Akasha von Rothschild, alias, Lilith. Age: 30. Talent: Blood Control: SS rank. Realm level, fifth realm Grandmaster, peak.</p>
<p>Appearance rating 98, peerless enchantress. Body rating 99, a stunning beauty, flawless. Body details: bus size 36E plus. Bus size S. Leg size S.</p>
<p>Status single. Innocent. Overall rating 99. Perfect. What? Shin Yuan gasped, feeling as if the terrifying data was about to blow the top of his head off.</p>
<p>99 points. This is the highest score I&#x27;ve ever seen since the system came out. It&#x27;s one point higher than Ling and Su Chingu, who both scored 98. And it&#x27;s an SS level talent, peak of the fifth realm Grandmaster. The most outrageous thing is that she&#x27;s already 30 years old and she&#x27;s still considered a virgin.</p>
<p>This is not scientific. Just as Shin Yuan was reeling from the explosive data, a new message appeared on the golden screen, making his heart nearly stop beating. Ding. A supreme level target with a score of 99 has been detected. The ultimate conquest quest, the Queen&#x27;s skirt, has been triggered.</p>
<p>Mission objective, get target Aasha&#x27;s submission level to 95%. Submission value. A special statistic that measures the complete allegiance of top leaders and it is extremely difficult to increase. Personal rewards one inherit 1/5ifth of the targets HP. Two replicate part of the SS level talent blood control ability can be specified.</p>
<p>Individual rewards. One complete recipes for tier six, tier 7, and tier 8 HP enhancement potions. Two, strategic level technology blueprint. Guardian type one individual exoskeleton armor complete set of blueprints. What? What? What? Shin Yuan&#x27;s heart pounded wildly when he saw the astronomical reward almost as if it would jump out of his throat.</p>
<p>Inherit 1/5if of the body&#x27;s vital energy. Akasha is at the peak of the fifth realm Grandmaster. Herqi and blood value must be at least several hundred,000, right? 1/5if of that is over 10,000. That&#x27;s enough to allow him to break through to the fourth realm of Grand Marshall Master on the spot. There are also some abilities that are replicated from SS level talents.</p>
<p>Amazing skill, not to mention the series of national awards that followed. Sixth, seventh, and eighth level chi and blood enhancement medicine. If this were to happen, the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s highle combat power would probably double on the spot. And that guardian type one individual combat armor. If this could be mass-produced, wouldn&#x27;t every ordinary soldier in the entire Umbrella Corporation become a super soldier? We&#x27;ve taken off.</p>
<p>Chapter 75. The Countess&#x27; probing touch, a kiss. Gentlemen, Akashas languid and melodious voice pulled Shin Yuan back to reality from his ecstasy. She noticed Shun Yuans momentary lapse in concentration and gracefully tried to withdraw her hand, a playful smile, curving her fiery red lips beneath the mask. Is there something in my hand that fascinates you so much? Shinyuan snapped back to his senses instantly.</p>
<p>Instead of letting go, he tightened his grip, firmly, holding her delicate hand that was trying to pull away. Then, with an extremely natural movement, he hooked his fingertips around the edge of the black lace and gently and slowly slipped the glove off. A flawless hand with skin as smooth as the finest white jade and perfectly manicured nails gleaming with purple polish was exposed to the air. No. A perfect smile brimming with appreciation and admiration appeared on Shun Yuans face.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m simply amazed at what kind of God could create such a perfect work of art. Under Akashas slightly surprised gaze, Shin Yuan leaned down slightly, took her smooth jade-like hand, and then with reverence and gentlemanly manner, gently placed a kiss on the back of her hand. His movements were standard and polite, and his demeanor carried the elegance of a classical aristocrat. But when he raised his eyes and looked at Akasha, his dark eyes gleamed with a light that was both admiring and aggressive. That look in her eyes didn&#x27;t seem like the kind of prey she could easily control.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s more like a top hunter of her caliber. Akasha&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. This man is much more interesting than she imagined. However, the moment Shun Yuan&#x27;s lips touched Akasha&#x27;s skin. Beep beep beep beep dash.</p>
<p>The energy detector which had just quieted down suddenly erupted with a piercing shriek. On the screen, the red dot representing Akasha&#x27;s energy value instantly broke through all thresholds and the entire area of the graphic distorted into pitch black, representing something unsolvable. Warning, abnormal energy fluctuations at the target. Secondary assessment in progress. Assessment failed.</p>
<p>Energy level has exceeded the machine&#x27;s detection limit. A technician&#x27;s voice trembled with fear. in the banquet hall. Just as Long Ing was about to rush out, her body suddenly stiffened, as if an invisible hand had gripped her heart tightly. A sense of impending doom, as if completely locked onto by a natural enemy, washed over me.</p>
<p>She stared in horror at the direction of the corridor. &quot;This woman is someone I can&#x27;t possibly contend with. Even if you burn your life force and unleash your strongest attack, you probably still won&#x27;t be able to inflict serious damage on the opponent.&quot; Leons face was ashen, and she growled through gritted teeth. She was actually hiding her true strength. Damn it.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the difference between being on the verge of breaking through to the sixth realm and actually having already broken through? What are those idiots in the intelligence department doing? It&#x27;s pointless to say all this now. Ziao Jing was suddenly stood up, his face revealing somnity and determination. With just the two of us and Ling, it&#x27;s impossible to take her down without alerting the entire city. unless we reduce the entire Dong Hai city to ruins and even then success isn&#x27;t guaranteed. He acted decisively and immediately connected Su Ching Xu and Lung Yu to their emergency communication channel.</p>
<p>Ching Xu Lua plans changed. Contact that person immediately. Use the highest level of encryption. Tell him we&#x27;ve caught a giant deep sea shark that&#x27;s about to transform into a dragon. make sure he sends a Seventh Realm Battle Emperor here immediately to oversee the situation.</p>
<p>Hurry. The moment the order was given, the entire Umbrella Corporation headquarters came into operation at high speed, like a war machine that had been activated instantly. Meanwhile, in the clubhouse corridor, Shin Yuan had no idea that his simple handkissing gesture had nearly caused a major commotion at the command post. He still held Akasha&#x27;s soft, boneless hand, an elegant smile on his face, and led her to the end of the corridor to a more secluded, luxurious lounge reserved for top VIPs. Akasha watched him with great interest, letting him lead her.</p>
<p>But just as the two were about to step into the lounge, she suddenly stopped. Boom! A terrifying pressure, like an invisible tide, suddenly erupted from her voluuptuous and alluring body. The air in the entire corridor seemed to be sucked out at that moment, becoming thick and heavy. The expensive wallpaper on the walls even made a cracking sound under the weight. A playful smile played on her lips as she looked at Shin Yuan with great interest through her beautiful violet eyes.</p>
<p>Young man, you don&#x27;t seem afraid of me at all. Did you know? Her voice turned cold and filled with cruel malice. The last man who dared to hold my hand like this, his blood has become an adornment in my wine glass. Faced with Akasha&#x27;s terrifying, almost tangible pressure, Shin Yuan felt as if he were being crushed by an invisible mountain, making it difficult to breathe. If it were any ordinary third realm martial artist, they would probably have been forced to their knees and made a fool of themselves in that instant.</p>
<p>But Shinuan is no ordinary person. The vital energy within his body, tempered by both dragon blood and dragon soul, along with the robust physique brought about by his unreasonable frank talent, began to operate automatically. At this moment, a warm yet doineering dragon aura surged from the depths of his dantion, instantly flowing through his limbs and bones, neutralizing most of the terrifying pressure that had invaded his body. He remained unfazed and even had the leisure to gently rub Akasha&#x27;s smooth, delicate hand with his thumb. He raised his head, a roguish smile on his face, and chuckled.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be my honor to be a part of your wine glass. But before that, won&#x27;t you buy me a drink first?&quot; Um, for the first time, a genuine look of surprise flashed across Akasha&#x27;s deep violet eyes. Although she only released less than 30% of her aura, it was enough to make even a peak level third realm martial artist feel suffocated. But this man in front of me, this little guy who looks like he&#x27;s only at the mid-stage of the third realm, can actually talk and laugh so easily. That&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s so interesting. The secrets he holds are far deeper than I imagined. She withdrew her oppressive aura, and her smile grew even brighter, as if the potentially fatal test had been nothing more than a harmless joke. Chapter 76. Shin Yuan led his men upstairs.</p>
<p>Muing Shu assault just then. Holy crap. Auan, where the hell did you snag this goddess? You didn&#x27;t even introduce her to the brothers. A loud exaggerated voice wreaking of alcohol boomed from the other end of the corridor. Zhao Ei with two hot scantily clad young models on his left and right swayed as he passed by.</p>
<p>He spotted Shin Yuan and Akasha holding hands intimately at a glance, his eyes almost popping out of their sockets. He immediately rushed over shouting, his exaggerated expression making him look like an Oscar-winning actor. Shinyuan mentally gave this god-level wingman a thousand thumbs up. He subtly released Akashas hand, then hooked his arm around Zho Yis shoulder, a sly glint in his eyes as he smiled slightly in Akasha&#x27;s direction. I&#x27;m getting to know my new friend better.</p>
<p>Young Master Zhao, be sensible and let us use your top-of-the-line suite. Don&#x27;t let anyone disturb us. Understand? He cleverly turned Zhao Yis unexpected disruption into a homefield advantage, allowing him to control the situation. No problem. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Zhao Ei immediately understood. He patted his chest, making a muffled thud, and declared confidently. The rooftop terrace is reserved for you all tonight. Anyone who dares to go up and disturb us, I&#x27;ll break their legs. He portrayed his lawless and utterly dissolute demeanor so vividly that it was so realistic that not a single flaw could be found.</p>
<p>As Akasha watched the scene of brotherly affection unfold before her, her red lips beneath the mask curled slightly upward and a playful yet profound light shown in her beautiful violet eyes. Play. You guys keep acting. She wanted to see how long this meticulously choreographed play could last. However, this scene was witnessed by a woman who came out of the banquet hall anxiously searching for Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>It is Muing Shua. Just moments before, she was savoring Shun Yuans promise to return and marry her once he became famous throughout the empire. Her heart filled with sweetness and a touch of shyness as she dreamed of the future. But the next second, she saw the man who had just made a marriage promise to her now leading another masked woman with an even more voluuptuous figure and a more noble and mysterious aura about to go upstairs. She felt that the beautiful fantasy she had just built up along with that sweetness shattered into countless pieces with a snap scattering on the cold corridor floor.</p>
<p>What kind of inspirational hero possesses F-level talent and defies fate? What kind of man will one day be renowned throughout the empire? This guy is clearly a complete scumbag who falls in love with every woman he meets and changes women faster than he changes clothes. A strong sense of grievance and anger welled up in my heart. Her cheeks flushed instantly, her fists clenched, and she was so angry that she almost rushed up to confront him on the spot. But her remaining rationality made her forcefully suppress this impulse. Her stunningly beautiful face was etched with displeasure, her beautiful eyes fixed on that glaring figure with a hint of frost.</p>
<p>Shinuan, accompanied by Akasha and led by Zhao E with excessive enthusiasm, headed towards the private elevator that led to the top floor emperor&#x27;s terrace. As she passed by Muing Shiua, Akasha suddenly stopped. Her deep violet eyes hidden behind the mask swept over Muing Shiua with disdain. The look in his eyes was as if he were looking at an insignificant old object. Then from those fiery red lips came a very soft, victorious sneer.</p>
<p>Oh, a sneer pierced Moo Ching Shua&#x27;s heart. Who is she? She is a global pop diva. She is the dream girl of millions of men. She is the apple of the eye of the Moo family surrounded by admirers. When has she ever suffered such humiliation to be treated with such contempt and disdain? What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s because of a man who just showered her with sweet words and made promises.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t accept it. How could she accept being abandoned like this? He was even more unwilling to lose to a mysterious woman who didn&#x27;t even dare to show her face. That contemptuous sneer ignited the deep-seated competitive spirit and unwillingness to admit defeat in Muing Shua&#x27;s heart. Her body trembled slightly, but was quickly brought under control by a strong force. Watching Shun Yuan and the masked woman walk into the elevator and watching the elevator doors slowly close, shutting out the glaring scene, suppressing the pentup grievances and anger within her, she stroed up to Zhoi.</p>
<p>Zhoi, could you please give me Mr. Shin&#x27;s contact information right now? Muing Shua forced herself to remain calm. Looking at her, who was on the verge of tears but was trying to appear strong, Zhaoi felt a pang of emotion. My brother Yuan is awesome. How long has it been? He&#x27;s already won over the queen&#x27;s heart.</p>
<p>Did you even make her cry? This charm is absolutely incredible. He scratched his head a blank. I don&#x27;t know either. Look on his face, shrugged and said with a hint of helplessness. To be honest, I don&#x27;t have any either.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan is elusive. He&#x27;s always the one who contacts me. I wouldn&#x27;t dare to reach out to him first. Seeing Mu Ching Xiwa&#x27;s increasingly agrieved expression, he quickly added, trying to comfort her. Don&#x27;t worry, knowing his personality, he&#x27;ll probably be wagging his tail to find you tomorrow.</p>
<p>I know him. He&#x27;s a man who can&#x27;t control his lust. He can&#x27;t resist pretty girls. You&#x27;re so beautiful. He definitely won&#x27;t forget you.</p>
<p>These words were less of a consolation and more of a rubbing salt into Mu Ching Shiwa&#x27;s already broken heart. Upon hearing this, Muing Shua felt a surge of blood rushing to her chest, and she bit her lower lip so hard it almost bled. She looked up, her almond-shaped eyes fixed on the elevator numbers that had reached the top floor, and silently made a vow in her heart, &quot;Shinuan! You big liar! You scumbag! Didn&#x27;t you say you were going to marry me? Didn&#x27;t you say you&#x27;d wait until you were famous throughout the empire? Didn&#x27;t you say that I was the person you wanted to protect for the rest of your life? Good. Very good. Since you dare to lie to me in public and have an ambiguous relationship with other women in front of me, then well see.</p>
<p>If you truly win the Imperial Pride tournament and become famous throughout the empire, yet you don&#x27;t come to marry me. I, Muing Shua, am not finished with you.&quot; Without a word, she turned around, her high heels clicking as she walked away without looking back. Her long, slender legs looked exceptionally beautiful against the backdrop of her silver star-studded gown. The hem of the dress drew an angry arc behind her, making her appear lonely and floren, yet also exuding an indomitable stubbornness. Watching her lonely and ferorn figure gradually disappear into the distance.</p>
<p>The two young models beside Zhao, he couldn&#x27;t help but speak up with a hint of jealousy. Their eyes held a mixture of shot and frea and ingratiation. Young master, what&#x27;s so great about Muing Shua? She&#x27;s just a singer, isn&#x27;t she? She got dumped by your brother. She&#x27;s nowhere near as good to you as we sisters are. As they spoke, they snuggled close to Zhao E in a coetish manner.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Zhao Yis playful smile vanished instantly, replaced by a cold, authoritative expression befitting a top tier heir to a wealthy family. He slapped each of them once. Although it wasn&#x27;t hard, the force imbued with internal energy instantly left red marks on the cheeks of the two young models. Roll. Who do you think you are? You dare compare yourself to her? The two young models were stunned by the beating, covering their faces with tears in their eyes, but dared not speak out in anger and could only shrink to the side in grievance.</p>
<p>They are usually quite famous in the entertainment industry, and ordinary people can&#x27;t even touch them. But at this moment, they are like frightened quailes. Zhao looked in the direction Muing Shua had left, then glanced at the rising numbers on the elevator, clicking his tongue in amazement, his eyes filled with admiration and envy for Shinuan. Chapter 77. When the countest reveals her true colors, the act can no longer continue.</p>
<p>Top floor, the presidential suite at the Imperial Terrace. The level of luxury here far exceeded Shin Yuan&#x27;s imagination. The entire suite occupies the top floor of the clubhouse, covering an area of over 2,000 square meters. Underfoot is a cool, smooth obsidian floor. Above is a holographic dome simulating a vast starry sky.</p>
<p>And in the distance, there is even an open air infinity pool overlooking the dazzling night view of the entire Dongai city. But Shin Yuan was not in the mood to appreciate any of this at the moment. He and Akasha sat facing each other across a huge round table carved from a single piece of white marble. Longing stood behind Shin Yuan like a perfect ice sculpture, expressionless. However, her cold phoenix eyes were fixed on Akasha opposite her.</p>
<p>The cold killing intent emanating from her belonging to the peak of the fourth level grand marshall master formed a stark contrast with Akasha&#x27;s lazy and noble aura. Your bodyguard is very good. Akasha&#x27;s gaze lingered on Lyings powerful and athletic physique for 3 seconds, a hint of approval flashing in her beautiful eyes. She then sneered inwardly. A martial artist at the peak of the fourth realm who can provide such close protection to a martial artist at the third realm.</p>
<p>If she were just an ordinary S-class playboy relying on family resources, then her name Akasha von Rothschild would be reversed. Beautiful women and fine wine. In this setting, shouldn&#x27;t we talk about romance and poetry? Shin Yuan poured her a glass of top quality red wine worth millions from a thousand years ago. Completely oblivious to the tense atmosphere in the room, he smiled and tried to break the deadlock. Romantic tales.</p>
<p>Akasha elegantly picked up her wine glass, gently swirled it, and the scarlet liquid rippled in the crystal glass, releasing an intoxicating aroma. Her red lips parted slightly, her voice languid yet alluring. I prefer to get straight to the point. For example, your bodyguard is quite nice. How about I borrow her for a couple of days?&quot; Upon hearing this, Lyings pretty face turned cold.</p>
<p>But before she could react, suddenly Lie&#x27;s voice filled with suppressed tension came through the military-grade brainwave communicator disguised as an earring in Shun Yuans ear. Auan, the situation has changed. That woman&#x27;s strength far exceeds our intelligence. We&#x27;ve just detected that she&#x27;s at the peak of the fifth realm Grandmaster. She could break through to the sixth realm at any moment.</p>
<p>The seven realms war emperors of the imperial capital have already departed on the Kuen, but it will take at least 2 hours to arrive. Hold her off at all costs. 2 hours. This is a death order. A death order.</p>
<p>Upon hearing those three words, Shinuan&#x27;s pupils contracted subconsciously for 0.1 seconds. This is a martial artist&#x27;s most instinctive reaction when receiving the highest order. However, this reaction was so subtle that even he himself was unaware of it. But Akash Sha, who was elegantly sipping her wine across from her, keenly noticed it. Her gaze instantly focused on Shun Yuans left ear.</p>
<p>There was an inconspicuous black stud earring that fit perfectly in the ear and did not reflect any light under the lamp. Brainwave communicator Akashas heart sank. The smile on her face only grew brighter and more captivating. It turned out that from the very beginning, she had fallen headlong into a trap that had been carefully laid for her. The game is over.</p>
<p>All right, young master. Let&#x27;s stop acting. She stared directly at Shun Yuan. Her deep violet eyes filled with mockery and coldness. Tell me, who are you? This identity is much more interesting than the so-called prodigy versus genius.</p>
<p>The vital energy within Lyings body erupted at this moment. She was prepared. If anything went wrong, she would immediately burn her life force and energy to forcefully break away with Shin Yuan. Shin Yuan felt a chill run through his body. the other party has seen through us.</p>
<p>Continuing this performance is pointless. He looked at the stunningly beautiful countest before him whose true intentions had been revealed and instead of answering, he asked, &quot;Before asking someone for their hand, shouldn&#x27;t you introduce yourself first? For example, how did you know that my identity was a disguise?&quot; Faced with Shan Yuan&#x27;s bold counterattack, Akasha giggled. The laughter, clear and melodious like silver bells, exuded the charm of a mature woman and quickly dispelled the tense, almost frozen, murderous aura in the room. That&#x27;s interesting. Really interesting.</p>
<p>She raised her wine glass, her beautiful eyes fixed on Shun Yuan, and said something that shocked everyone. All right, since you want to play the honest game, I won&#x27;t beat around the bush with you anymore. I, Akasha von Rothschild, am one of the future direct heirs of the Rothschild family, currently serving as the director of the intelligence department of the Free Federation. I came here to find you. Shinyuan&#x27;s mind went blank.</p>
<p>What? They confessed everything. Sister, does your federal government know you&#x27;re acting as a spy? Did you spend all your money on bags? An incredulous look appeared on Long Yings cold, pretty face. In the suite next door, Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua, who overheard everything through listening devices, jumped up from their chairs, their jaws almost dropping to the floor. They originally thought Akasha would continue to pretend and wait for an opportunity to kidnap Shin Yuan, but who knew she would so bluntly reveal her identity? What kind of incredible plot twist is this? Shin Yuan was inwardly turmoil, but he gritted his teeth and continued acting. Looking for me? I&#x27;m just a student about to go to the capital for a competition.</p>
<p>What place would be worth your personal trip, Earl? Chapter 78. The Queen&#x27;s Kiss. The Dragon&#x27;s Mark. It&#x27;s over. We&#x27;re completely exposed.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt as if a divine thunderbolt from the heavens had struck his crown once again. Holy crap. Not only did she know, she even looked me in the face and said it. She didn&#x27;t even try to act. How are we supposed to play like this? Prepare to break through.</p>
<p>A fierce glint flashed in Lyings eyes and her Yuan Chi telepathic message exploded in Shun Yuans mind. Prepare for a full-scale attack just as this great battle was about to break out. Akasha suddenly smiled. That smile was like a spring breeze melting snow or like a hundred flowers blooming, instantly dispelling all the murderous intent and tension in the room. Don&#x27;t be nervous.</p>
<p>I told you I meant no harm. She looked at Shan Yuan, who was completely stunned, tilted her noble head, and asked a question in an extremely serious tone that petrified everyone present. I just wanted to ask Mr. Shin a question. Would you be willing to have a few children with me? Faced with Akasha&#x27;s shocking question, Shinuan was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Longing behind him also froze on the spot. The murderous aura that had just gathered on his body, ready to destroy everything, stuck there in an awkward position. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua, who were about to order the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s warriors to launch a full-scale attack, froze on the spot. The two stared at each other, their faces filled with huge question marks. Who am I? Where am I? What did I just hear? What kind of indecent language is this? You, a top agent of the Federation, a terrifying existence at the peak of the fifth realm Grandmaster, traveled thousands of miles to the territory of our dragon Empire, just to borrow a seed from our company&#x27;s young master.</p>
<p>Did they pick up the wrong script? Akashas incredibly long legs encased in black lace stockings seemed to tread on Shun Yuans heartbeat with every step, exuding a breathtaking sexiness. Step back. Ling was the first to react. She stood in front of Shun Yuan, her cold phoenix eyes like two drawn swords locked onto Akasha. Otherwise die.</p>
<p>Oh. Akasha stopped in front of her. To the astonishment of the two men, she slowly removed the exquisite silver mask from her face. A noble, beautiful face, brimming with the ultimate charm of a mature woman, was exposed to the air without reservation. That wasn&#x27;t just ordinary beauty.</p>
<p>It was a queen-like beauty that combined the most stunning looks of both East and West, exuding an aggressive and conquering aura. She has a high straight nose and deep set eyes, yet possesses the soft facial features characteristic of eastern women. Her skin was as white as the finest jade, and her violet eyes were like black holes containing the stars and the sea, as if they could completely suck in one&#x27;s soul. Hiss. Shinyuan couldn&#x27;t help but gasp, inwardly praising.</p>
<p>A 98 point rating for looks is no joke. This guy isn&#x27;t human. He&#x27;s a walking hormone bomb. Your excellency, Mr. Akasha completely ignored the murderous aura emanating from Ling that was enough to freeze one&#x27;s soul.</p>
<p>Her gaze passed over Long Yings shoulder and landed directly on Shinuan. Her fiery red lips parted slightly once more. You haven&#x27;t answered my question yet. Do you want to have a child with me? A child who has the noblest blood in the world? Court death. Longing roared, and the power of her dragon soul erupted from her body, ready to make her move.</p>
<p>The next second, she was horrified to discover that all the blood in her body had frozen. Not a single bit of vital energy can be mobilized. This is suppression of realm and bloodline. Despite being an SS level dragon soul battle body, she was completely suppressed by her opponent in an instant. Just as Longing was in a state of shock, Akashas figure vanished like a ghost.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt a rich, fragrant breeze waft towards him, and then a soft, incredibly voluuptuous, and perfectly proportioned body sat heavily on him. &quot;Before we get down to business, let&#x27;s collect some interest, my dear Mr. Shan,&quot; Akasha&#x27;s languid yet alluring voice whispered sweet nothings in his ear. Before Shinuan could react, a magnified, breathtakingly beautiful face loomed over him. &quot;Um,&quot; Akashan never expected that this man, who looked like prey, would dare to fight back.</p>
<p>Just as the two began their first lip reading exchange, Long Yings eyes widened in fury. In the command center, Lie Yuns anxious voice rang in Shun Yuans ears again through the brainwave communicator. Shin Yuan Shin Yuan, what&#x27;s the situation on your end? Answer me. If you don&#x27;t answer within 5 seconds, we&#x27;ll close the net. Ahem, Sister Lee, Brotherhiao.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stammered, his voice somewhat unclear, explaining that the situation was a bit special and he couldn&#x27;t go into details for the time being. Not convenient to go into details. Xiao Juns gruff voice also broke in, tinged with anger. Shin Yuan, this is a company order. Explain yourself clearly.</p>
<p>What exactly happened? I&#x27;m risking my life to hold her back. Shin Yuan managed to squeeze out a few words, his tone carrying a sense of righteous sacrifice. Don&#x27;t rush to close the net. I&#x27;ve already got her under control. Is it under control? Lie Yun and Xiao Jinga looked at each other in the command center.</p>
<p>Are you sure it&#x27;s control, not being controlled? Leons lips twitched. Ziao Jing Wua was also completely bewildered. This kid said he risked his life to hold him back and even controlled him. What was he doing? Don&#x27;t talk nonsense. Lean glared at him, but she couldn&#x27;t hide the doubt in her voice.</p>
<p>But what does he mean by control? Does it mean successfully suppressing the other party&#x27;s actions or something else? This kid always has a lot of clever ideas. He might actually have some amazing tricks up his sleeve. Xiao Jingwa stroked his chin, his face full of confusion. Hopefully, the control he was referring to was the kind of control we could understand. The two were filled with doubts, but Shin Yuan&#x27;s words that he had already controlled the situation to some extent gave them a glimmer of hope, so they had no choice but to temporarily suppress the order to launch a full-scale attack.</p>
<p>Alarm bells rang loudly in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. Warning, warning. Detected that the target is implanting an SS level talent blood control accessory mark into the host&#x27;s body. Blood slave mark. Once the branding is successful, the host will become a complete slave to the target with their life and death entirely in the hands of the target.</p>
<p>What? This woman was definitely up to no good. Shinuan was terrified and was just about to use his dragon energy to resist. The next second, the systems notification tone became incredibly excited and enthusiastic. Foreign mental imprint intrusion detected. System countermeasures activated.</p>
<p>Dragon chi purification activated. Blood slave mark removal successful. Reverse branding in progress. Congratulations, host. A unique mark has been successfully implanted into the target Akasha&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>Ding. Target Akasha von Rothschild. Sensing a higher level of life imprint. Instinctively felt fear and submission. Submission value plus 10%.</p>
<p>Current progress 10%. Chapter 79. The brand. The reversal of prey and hunter. The heir in the entire presidential suite.</p>
<p>Akasha&#x27;s voluuptuous and alluring body was like a supple and beautiful serpent. The terrifying aura and boundless vitality within this young man were like a dormant volcano containing a primal power that even made her heart tremble. This feeling both fascinated and wary of her. She doesn&#x27;t believe in superstitions. She is Akasha von Rothschild.</p>
<p>She is the woman standing at the pinnacle of federal power. She is the future queen with SS level blood control talent. How could a mere young master of a protective umbrella company possibly resist the suppression of her innate bloodline? Akasha sneered inwardly and once again mobilized her incomparably pure primordial blood essence, attempting to implant the blood slave mark, which represented absolute enslavement into the depths of Shun Yuan&#x27;s soul for the second time and even more powerfully. However, the moment her mental power touched Shu Yuan&#x27;s mind, the mark that had just been implanted by the system, emitting a faint golden halo, suddenly burst forth with dazzling golden light, like an emperor who had been thoroughly enraged. A terrifying dragon&#x27;s might, originating from the very pinnacle of life, and possessing unparalleled majesty and doineering power, violently rebounded back through the channel where the two&#x27;s spiritual energies converged.</p>
<p>Akasha&#x27;s body trembled suddenly, and her beautiful violet eyes, which always carried an air of langor and nobility, revealed a look of pain. Her soul seemed to be gripped tightly by an invisible ancient dragon claw and then torn apart. Ding. The target Akasha&#x27;s bloodline is suppressed by the dragon mark, causing her to instinctively fear. Submission value plus 5%.</p>
<p>Current progress 15%. How is that possible? A huge wave surged through Akasha&#x27;s heart. She was unwilling to accept it. She couldn&#x27;t believe it. For the third and final time, she mobilized all her mental energy like a gambler who had lost everything and bet all her chips.</p>
<p>We are determined to crush this man&#x27;s mental defenses and make him our most loyal dog. The backlash was more intense and violent than ever before. Puff! Akasha felt a sweet taste in her throat, and a mouthful of bright red blood spilled from the corner of her mouth, staining her fiery red lips even more alluringly. The mark on her body was not removed. Instead, it seemed to be nourished, becoming more solid and doineering.</p>
<p>Ding. Target. Akasha&#x27;s third attempt has failed. It has been confirmed that the host&#x27;s bloodline level is far higher than the targets. Submission value plus 10%.</p>
<p>Current progress 25%. Continuing down this path will only bring shame upon ourselves. Akasha shoved Shun Yuan away abruptly. Her chest heaving violently, her breathing rapid, her beautiful violet eyes filled with surprise and apprehension, looking at the man who had been suppressed by her, yet looked innocent, and even had a hint of reminiscence. She felt a turmoil in her heart.</p>
<p>What kind of monster is this dragon seed? Shin Yuan was pushed away, clicked his tongue, and asked with lingering interest. Why did it stop? I wanted to understand you and experience things more deeply. That flippant tone gave Akasha for the first time an absurd feeling that the prey was about to turn on the hunter. She Akasha von Rothschild. Whatever she sets her sights on, whatever man she desires, she has never failed to obtain.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s determined to have this man. Even if we can&#x27;t enslave him, we must keep him firmly bound to our chariot. Want to continue? Akasha gracefully straightened her disheveled skirt, regaining her commanding queenly aura, her violet eyes flashing with a dangerous light. Then come with me. Leave this corrupt backward empire that is about to be eliminated by the times.</p>
<p>Come to my manor, to my castle. There I will show you what true heavenly happiness is. She extended her slender hand clad in a black lace glove to shun yuan, her beautiful violet eyes sparkling. There you will have countless riches, supreme power, and the world&#x27;s most beautiful and charming women who know how to please men. Of course, that includes me.</p>
<p>All you have to do is nod, and it will all be yours. These words are irresistible to any man. They are a temptation from the devil. Shinyuan&#x27;s heart stirred upon hearing this. To her estate, to her castle, to live that shameless, fantastical life with this stunningly beautiful woman with a 99% rating everyday.</p>
<p>What? Just thinking about it is exciting. However, he knew perfectly well what was going on in his mind. This woman talks a good game, talking about wealth, power, and beauty. If I really went with her, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d be immediately tied to the lab table and treated like the best breeding pig. Working around the clock to continue the Rothschild family&#x27;s bloodline until I was completely drained.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not heaven. That&#x27;s hell. That sounds very tempting. Shin Yuan&#x27;s face revealed a look of lustful infatuation. He looked at Akasha with longing in his eyes and reached out his hand as if to grasp the hand that symbolized heaven just as his fingertips were about to touch Akasha&#x27;s glove.</p>
<p>He abruptly changed the subject, a troubled expression appearing on his face and sighed. What a pity. I&#x27;m a homebody and I also have this problem. I&#x27;m extremely afraid of my wife. He pointed behind him to the person who had a cold face from beginning to end like an iceberg that would never melt.</p>
<p>Wong Ying, who had been enduring the humiliation and desperately trying to break free of her restraints, trembled almost imperceptibly when she heard the words afraid of his wife. The surging anger and killing intent in her cold Phoenix eyes froze instantly, and a very complex emotion flashed across them. What did he say? Wife. This thought caused her mind, which was on the verge of exploding from witnessing everything, to go blank for a moment. At least he still has some conscience.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan continued explaining earnestly. Look, my wife is beautiful, has a great figure, and is a fierce fighter. If I dare to run off with another woman, she would break my legs. So, I appreciate your kind offer, your excellency, but I&#x27;m afraid I cannot accept it. These witty remarks left Akasha speechless.</p>
<p>The smile on her face froze for a moment. Afraid of his wife? You&#x27;re a man who can withstand my blood slave mark and even dare to take advantage of me. And you&#x27;re telling me you&#x27;re afraid of your wife? You&#x27;re kidding me. Chapter 80. Escape by jumping off a building.</p>
<p>Activate plan A. Akasha&#x27;s gaze swept back and forth between Shun Yuan&#x27;s henpecked and cowardly demeanor and Ly Yings icy expression, her red lips curving into a mocking smile. Play. They have quite a good understanding. She knew very well that powerful figures from the capital could arrive at any moment, and she didn&#x27;t have time to play along with their boring marital drama.</p>
<p>If you refuse a toast offered with politeness, then you&#x27;ll have to suffer the consequences. Since you&#x27;re so attached to your home, I guess I&#x27;ll have to lend you a hand.&quot; Before she finished speaking, her fair and slender hand transformed into a blur. Her five fingers like hooks, aiming straight for Shun Yuan, who was still lazily leaning on the sofa. She wanted to take him away by force. However, just as her fingertips were about to touch Shun Yuan&#x27;s collar, court death.</p>
<p>A chilling, bone chilling roar exploded in the room. As soon as the restraints were released, Ling, who had been suppressed by Akasha&#x27;s realm pressure, finally erupted. Her SS level dragon soul battle body was instantly activated to its limit. The golden energy no longer flowed slowly, but burst forth from her body like a volcanic eruption, condensing behind her into a golden dragon-shaped phantom tens of meters long with majestic eyes and menacing scales. Roar dash.</p>
<p>The dragon&#x27;s roar shook the heavens. Long Yings phoenix eyes had transformed into cold golden vertical pupils devoid of any human emotion. She took a step, the ground cracked, and she threw a punch. There are no fancy moves, just the purest and most doineering power. This punch carried all the anger and determination she possessed as a peak fourthrem cultivator.</p>
<p>Before the fist even arrived, the sharp sound of it tearing through the air was enough to make one&#x27;s eardrums ache, and it was aimed straight at Akasha&#x27;s back. Akasha&#x27;s expression turned serious. She felt the madness in Long Yings punch, the willingness to shatter like Jade rather than survive like a broken tile, a direct confrontation. She could, of course, but that would inevitably waste precious time during the evacuation. Overestimating one&#x27;s abilities, Akasha snorted coldly, grabbed Shin Yuan&#x27;s wrist, and pulled him away.</p>
<p>Instead of confronting Ling headon, she used the momentum to turn around and pull Shinuan in front of her, causing him to crash directly into the huge floor toseeiling window made of specialteered glass behind them. Bang dash. With a piercing explosion, the tempered glass shattered into countless crystals, instantly alarming the entire clubhouse. Under Lyings furious gaze, Akasha wrapped her arms around Shun Yuans waist and, like a black owl, leaped from a height of 100 m. Don&#x27;t even think about leaving.</p>
<p>Longing roared and without thinking was about to chase after him through the broken window. Just as she was about to leap out, a command suppressed with anger yet utterly calm rang out through the encrypted channel in her tactical headset. It&#x27;s Lean&#x27;s voice. Longing, stop right there. Protect yourself.</p>
<p>Everyone, heed my command. The target has escaped. Plan A activated. All personnel move in. The instant the order was given.</p>
<p>At the same moment, the military bunkers disguised as flower beds, sculptures, and even trash cans beneath the entire clubhouse building at top the clouds roared open. Thousands of fully armed Imperial Special Forces soldiers and armed warriors who had been lying in ambush swarmed out from all directions like a hornet&#x27;s nest that had been disturbed. The dark muzzles of guns and the dense energy cannons were charged at the same time and aimed at the black figure that was falling rapidly in the air. A massive net woven from steel and energy tightened with a roar. The wind howled in his ears, and the intense weightlessness from the rapid fall from a 100 meters in the air made Shun Yuan&#x27;s stomach churn up to his throat.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Playing this high? Jumping off a building?&quot; That languid yet magnetic voice reached Shun Yuans ears amidst the howling wind. Just as the two were about to land, the thousands of electromagnetic rifles and energy cannons below, which had been aimed at them, roared deafeningly at the same time. Whoosh! Whoosh! In an instant, thousands of blue energy beams, like a violent downpour sweeping upwards, tore through the night sky, and instantly covered the entire area where they were. That dense barrage of firepower was enough to tear a small interstellar warship to shreds in 3 seconds. Shin Yuan&#x27;s face turned pale with fright as he watched the overwhelming rain of deathly light descend upon him.</p>
<p>What? They&#x27;re attacking their own people, too. However, facing this inescapable net that could instantly vaporize even a grandmaster of the fourth realm, Akasha showed no sign of panic, as if she had expected it all along. Just as the dense barrage of fire was about to engulf them, she simply raised her slender hand clad in a black lace glove and snapped her fingers lightly in the air. Smack. The crisp snap of fingers was drowned out by the deafening roar of gunfire.</p>
<p>But this soft sound seemed like a signal from hell. Moment from the shadowy corners surrounding the clubhouse at top the clouds. From the bodies of those disguised as ordinary passers by. From those seemingly harmless hover cars. More than 300 federal spies who had been lying in weight here rushed out of the darkness at the same time, fearless of death.</p>
<p>Some of them wielded Gaus submachine guns, firing wildly at the Imperial Army. Others detonated high energy bombs hidden on their bodies, using their own flesh and blood to blast open gaps in the dense barrage of fire. Still others activated their berserk mutated genes, turning into monsters that only knew how to kill and charged madly toward the Imperial lines. They fought the most brutal and frantic way to buy that precious second for their queen. At the same time, for figures whose auras were a h 100 times stronger than these cannon fodder rose into the sky from different directions like four unshathed swords, their goal was crystal clear.</p>
<p>Those were the three who had just rushed out of the clubhouse. Longing, Leon, Xiaoinwa, boom. Gunshots, explosions, the sound of metal tearing apart, and the frantic roars of the dying echoed through the night sky of Donghai city in that instant. This retreat, meticulously planned by Akasha, turned into the most intense and brutal urban street battle in Donghai City in decades within just a few seconds. Countless Federation spies were torn to shreds and turned into a reign of blood under the overwhelming firepower of the Imperial Army, which was like a steel torrent.</p>
<p>But they also succeeded in creating valuable chaos for their queen. Get out of here. Longing watched as Akasha and Shun Yuan disappeared into the night, her golden vertical pupils blazing with fury. Just as she was about to give chase, she was blocked by two fourthrem grand marshall masters who were also wielding long swords and exuding a fierce aura. These two were two of Akasha&#x27;s four personal guards.</p>
<p>Their swordsmanship was ruthless and cunning with every move aimed at Long Yings vital points. It was a crazy fighting style that risked their lives for injury. Plank. playing. The sound of metal clashing was deafening and sparks flew everywhere.</p>
<p>Although Long Yings strength far surpassed theirs, she was momentarily held back by these two madmen who were determined to die and was unable to break free. On the other side, Li Yun and Xiao Jingwa were also held up by two other guards for 2 minutes. Chapter 81. Citywide Manot upon buried along with him. Shin Yuan was carried under Akasha&#x27;s arm in an extremely humiliating position like a tattered sack as they sped through a hail of bullets and towering flames.</p>
<p>He was horrified to discover that his body was tightly bound by an invisible yet doineering force. And even the flow of blood in his body had become extremely slow, making it impossible for him to resist. He could only helplessly watch himself drift further and further away from Longing and the others. Even on this battlefield, amidst the chaos of battle, and even with him as a burden, Akasha&#x27;s speed remained as swift as a ghost. Her incredibly long legs encased in black lace stockings unleashed astonishing power with every push she made against walls or rooftops, making her feel as weightless as a feather and easily evading most attacks.</p>
<p>Occasionally, stray bullets that were impossible to dodge were easily deflected by the faint, almost invisible blood red shield covering her body. powerful. That&#x27;s incredible. Is this the strength of a peak grandmaster of the fifth realm? It&#x27;s like a bug player using invincibility mode, stomping on newbies in the starting village. As Shin Yuan looked down at the Federation spies below, who had been reduced to ashes by the Empire&#x27;s artillery fire while trying to cover them, a complex and indescribable emotion welled up in his heart.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Are they all your men?&quot; Akasha didn&#x27;t look back, continuing to move swiftly, her tone icy and devoid of any emotion. No, they are not my subordinates. They are merely theerary objects I prepared for you. It is their greatest honor as servants of the Rothschild family to be willing to give their lives for your arrival. These chilling words sent a shiver down Shin Yuan&#x27;s spine.</p>
<p>This woman doesn&#x27;t even consider those who risked their lives for her as human beings. In her eyes, those subordinates who risked their lives for her were no different from ants on the roadside. Boom! Another building collapsed amidst the fierce artillery fire, sending up clouds of dust. Lie Yun and Zhiao quickly killed the two crazed guards. Before they could even catch their breath, they leaped up and boarded a Blackbird class assault fighter jet that the Umbrella Corporation had been hovering in midair.</p>
<p>&quot;Chase her! We can&#x27;t let her get away!&quot; Ziao Jingua personally took the pilot&#x27;s seat, pushed the control stick, and the fighter jet emitted a piercing roar, instantly transforming into a streak of light, and rapidly chasing after the direction Akasha had fled. Behind them, more than 20 wingmen of the same model also formed a combat formation and followed closely behind. A thrilling chase has officially begun in the skies above the city. Akasha, holding Shun Yuan, leaped rapidly among the towering skyscrapers of the city. Her incredibly long legs encased in black lace stockings unleashed astonishing power and speed with each push against the wall, making her appear like a phantom in the night, leaving after images that were almost imperceptible to the naked eye in the steel forest.</p>
<p>On the ground, Ling had also broken free from the entanglement. She pushed the speed of her dragon soul battle body to the limit, her golden figure flying through the streets like lightning, attempting to intercept her from the ground. But Akasha&#x27;s speed is just too fast. It was so fast that even Longing felt desperate. The black figure was getting further and further away from her.</p>
<p>Warning, target is approaching the port area. Repeat, target is approaching the port area. Inside the fighter jet, piercing alarms blared incessantly. Open fire. Block her route with artillery fire.</p>
<p>Lean looked at the rapidly moving red dot on the screen and decisively gave the order to fire. Receive. The wingman formation immediately adjusted its formation, and the six-barreled Vulcan cannons under the nose of the aircraft began to emit a teeth grinding, spinning sound. Da da da. The next second, a scorching energy blast roared and tore through the night sky.</p>
<p>An energy blast grazed past Shin Yuan&#x27;s body, blasting a signal tower next to him into countless flying metal fragments. The scorching heat even singed a few strands of Shin Yuan&#x27;s hair. What? Shinuan was so frightened that his soul almost flew out of his body. He felt that he had never been so close to death. He was held under Akasha&#x27;s arm like a lamb to the slaughter, watching the deadly energy blasts explode around him.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t fire. We&#x27;re on the same side. We&#x27;re on the same side. I&#x27;m still in her hands. Are you trying to kill me, too? His voice, transmitted clearly through the communicator in his earring, reached Li Yun and Xiao Jingwa&#x27;s ears.</p>
<p>However, his cries for help were met with Lie Yuns mocking and gloating voice coming through the communicator. Oh dear, young master, what are you afraid of? You forgot your dragon soul jade pendant can withstand all attacks from anyone below the fifth realm Grandmaster. Forget a few energy blasts. Even a small nuclear bomb exploding next to you wouldn&#x27;t harm you in the slightest. Oh, right.</p>
<p>That jade pendant also contains a trace of martial arts essence left behind by that person. It will automatically trigger whenever you are under a fatal threat. Don&#x27;t think that this countest is just at the peak of the fifth realm. Even if she really breaks through to the sixth realm, she won&#x27;t be able to harm a single hair on your head. So, you can rest assured.</p>
<p>We promise to send you and her off with the fiercest artillery fire. Huh. Shinyan was stunned after hearing this. Dragon soul jade pendant invincible below the five realms. Is there still the true meaning of martial arts? Holy crap.</p>
<p>After the initial shock, a tremendous sense of security and confidence instantly surged through his entire body. Since they can&#x27;t die, what&#x27;s there to be afraid of? Shinuan immediately changed his attitude. One second, the hostages were terrified and crying for their parents. The next, they were arrogant and doineering wararmongers who wanted nothing more than to stir up trouble. He spoke into the communicator, his voice even more agitated than Leon&#x27;s, roaring.</p>
<p>Why didn&#x27;t you say so sooner? What are you waiting for? Don&#x27;t hesitate. Fire at me. Use the strongest firepower of your umbrella corporation. Use your company&#x27;s most expensive missiles. Bomb them hard.</p>
<p>Today, either she dies or we all have a blast. On the other end of the communicator, Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua looked at each other, their mouths twitching wildly as they listened to Shu Yuan&#x27;s sudden, almost insane outburst. This kid is a real character who can change his expression all over again. Akasha also heard Shinuan shouts. She looked down at the man in her arms who had been trembling with fear just a moment ago, but now looked excited as if he wished she were blown up on the spot.</p>
<p>Something&#x27;s not right. Something&#x27;s really wrong. Chapter 82. Infiltrating enemy aircraft. Spy within a spy.</p>
<p>Natasha, as you wish. Lean suppressed laughter came through the communicator. The next second, the fighter jet&#x27;s firepower increased to a whole new level. Akasha frowned slightly when she heard Shinuan&#x27;s shouts. The immense blood red energy within her body erupted, forming a more solid and massive blood red shield around her and Shun Yuan&#x27;s bodies.</p>
<p>At the same time, her speed increased again. She withstood the intense artillery fire, transforming into a streak of crimson light that pierced the night sky, charging madly towards the distant port. There lay her last escape route, one she had prepared long ago. Right at that moment, a private fighter jet, entirely black with a lifelike crimson rose emblem branded on its fuselof, silently swooped down from the thick clouds. The fighter jets hatch opened.</p>
<p>Inside the cockpit, a familiar figure came into Shaun Yuan&#x27;s view. Natasha, she changed into a smart and stylish black flight suit, which perfectly accentuated her fiery and alluring figure. Her face was pale with a sickly palar, but her azure eyes, which always held a touch of allure and determination, were calm and focused. She calmly maneuvered the fighter jet with remarkable precision as she came to meet her new superior. Before fleeing the East China Sea, Akasha gave her only one task, to stay here, fly this plane, and wait for her.</p>
<p>You are not allowed to participate in any battles or contact anyone. Come up here. Akasha looked at the fighter jet so close at hand and finally a victorious, elegant, yet cruel smile appeared on her lips. She won. However, just as she was about to lead Shin Yuan into the open hatch among the pursuing fighter jets, Li Yun and Xiao Jingwa exchanged a glance.</p>
<p>The two showed no signs of anxiety or anger and instead simultaneously revealed smiles like cunning old foxes who had finally caught their prey. Everything seemed to be proceeding according to a larger, more elaborate script. Just before boarding the fighter jet, Akasha demonstrated her extreme regard for Shun Yuan, this rare treasure. She didn&#x27;t even board the plane herself first. Instead, with an extremely delicate and gentle force, she gently tossed Shun Yuan, who was in her arms, into the open cabin first.</p>
<p>The movements were so gentle, as if they were afraid of hurting him. Shin Yuan traced an arc in the air before plunging head first into a soft, warm embrace that carried a familiar, delicate fragrance. It&#x27;s Natasha. She had left the driver&#x27;s seat at some point and was waiting at the cabin door. Shin Yuan threw himself into her arms, his cheek once again feeling that familiar softness.</p>
<p>The two locked eyes. Shin Yuan was frantically conveying a message through his eyes. What do I do now? This woman is going way too far. Am I really going to be sold abroad and worked as a pig? Natasha studied Shin Yuan without making a sound. And then with an extremely subtle movement that only the two of them could perceive, she gently squeezed his palm.</p>
<p>Everything is proceeding according to plan, so I&#x27;m at ease. This subtle gesture calmed Shin Yuan&#x27;s anxious heart. It seems that Lie Yun and Xiao Jingwa had a backup plan. Just then, Akasha gracefully, like a queen, leaped into the cabin. She didn&#x27;t even glance at the wartorrn city behind her, nor at the four bodyguards and more than 300 federal spies who had died trying to buy her time.</p>
<p>Those people&#x27;s lives and deaths were none of her concern. Bang! The hatch closed. The fighter jet emitted a deep roar, transformed into a black streak, and sped towards the vast international sea at a terrifying speed far exceeding that of military fighter jets. They quickly left the 20 oddwing men who were anxiously chasing them far behind. Inside the cabin, Akasha sat down on the leather sofa opposite Shinuan.</p>
<p>Her incredibly long legs, encased in black lace stockings, had been torn in several places by the aftershocks of artillery fired during the previous battle, revealing large expanses of her fair and delicate skin along with traces of crimson blood. But this did not detract from her beauty. On the contrary, it added a touch of wildness and deadly sexiness to her noble and elegant temperament. She crossed her legs, her deep violet eyes looking at Shun Yuan opposite her with great interest and smiled playfully. Young man, you are mine now.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan looked at her, but in his heart he was cursing her incessantly. Damn it. If I hadn&#x27;t known you guys had a backup plan, I&#x27;d probably be crying by now. He remained outwardly calm, but instead asked the question that had been bothering him. I&#x27;m very curious.</p>
<p>He looked at the stunningly beautiful queen before him, who seemed to have victory firmly in her grasp and asked with a serious expression, &quot;You went to such lengths, kissing me and kidnapping me. What were you after? I&#x27;m just an ordinary person who awakened an F-rank talent of good fortune. Is it worth all this fuss?&quot; Even at the cost of sacrificing the entire spy network of the East China Sea, what&#x27;s the point? When Akasha heard his question, it was as if she had heard the biggest joke in the world. She let out a silvery laugh. laughing so hard that her body trembled and her breathtaking curves heaved violently.</p>
<p>&quot;Little gentleman, you&#x27;re so cute.&quot; She stopped laughing, her beautiful violet eyes fixed on Shun Yuan, her voice carrying an air of self-righteousness. What I&#x27;m after is you, of course. I brought you back so that I could have a dozen, no, dozens of children with you. It&#x27;s very simple, isn&#x27;t it? Just for having children. All that effort, all those deaths just to find someone who can have children is the average number of infertile people in your federal government.</p>
<p>Seeing Shun Yuan&#x27;s still confused expression, Akasha&#x27;s smile became even more eerie and fanatical. She stood up from the sofa and walked gracefully to Shun Yuan once again. She leaned down, her beautiful face almost touching Shin Yuans. In an extremely seductive, devilish tone, she whispered in his ear a scene that was both hellish and fatally alluring. Do you know what will happen to a machine like yours if it falls into the hands of a family like ours? You will be deprived of all human rights and kept like the finest breeding stock in the most luxurious manner.</p>
<p>You will spend the rest of your life in extreme joy and pain. Your only task each day is to constantly interact with all sorts of top tier women from around the world. Women with the finest bloodlines. Not a minute can be stopped until you are completely worthless. Shinyuan felt a chill run down his spine and his mouth went dry.</p>
<p>He even felt a dull ache in his kidneys. But he was even more puzzled. He forced himself to remain calm, frowning as he said, &quot;But I&#x27;ve heard that ancient families like yours value the purity of bloodlines the most. Why would you ask an outsider like me to dilute your noble lineage?&quot; Chapter 83. Akasha to become the new queen.</p>
<p>A tragic slap in the face. Delilution. Akasha&#x27;s smile vanished instantly, replaced by a sharp, all-seeing gaze. She leaned down again, this time with an even more doineering motion, and pulled Shin Yuan up from the sofa. She whispered in his ear with an extremely seductive, devilish tone.</p>
<p>&quot;My dearest young man, do you think I only want your jeans? No. What I want is for you to become my man, the sole master of my new dynasty. Help me, and I will give you everything. Rebel against me, and you will only become a prisoner being used.&quot; Before she finished speaking, she charged forward again with doineering force. This time it&#x27;s no longer a test, but a blatant invasion on a spiritual level.</p>
<p>Warning. Target detected its fourth attempt to implant a mental imprint. Dragon chi purification activated. Purification in progress. Purification successful.</p>
<p>Reverse suppression is underway. Warning. The target has significantly strengthened its mental barrier. The attempt to suppress it has failed. Due to repeated failed imprinting attempts, the target Akasha has become extremely wary of the host&#x27;s bloodline.</p>
<p>Submission value remains unchanged. Current progress 25%. A few minutes later, for the first time, an undisguised shock appeared on Akasha&#x27;s languid and hotty beautiful face. As expected, that&#x27;s exactly how it is, she muttered to herself, her eyes burning with a fervor that seemed to consume Shin Yuan. What that top tier Am prophet said was actually true.</p>
<p>You are completely uncontrollable by any mental means. Looking at the bewildered Shun Yuan, she suddenly laughed greedily. You think your talent only lets you do that? Wrong. Utterly wrong. Your talent isn&#x27;t frank or S-rank at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a rule-based talent that transcends all ranks. You don&#x27;t dilute any bloodline. You only perfect them. Akasha opened her arms as if embracing a brand new future, her voice trembling slightly with excitement. The offspring born from your body can not only inherit all the mother&#x27;s talents and bloodline 100%, but also remove the impurities and elevate the bloodline to the most perfect form it can theoretically achieve.</p>
<p>She approached step by step, her beautiful violet eyes reflecting Shun Yuan&#x27;s shocked face. So, you see, my dear Mr. Shan, I didn&#x27;t capture you to find a tool. My goal is to create a completely new Rothschild dynasty composed of pure bloodlines and I will be the new queen of the Rothschild dynasty just like now. Akasha pointed out the fighter jet window to the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s pursuit aircraft which were now far behind them.</p>
<p>A disdainful smile playing on her lips. You&#x27;ll always be stuck following in the Federation&#x27;s footsteps, eating our leftover exhaust fumes, never even having the right to surpass us. She began to educate Shun Yuan. Her words filled with mockery and contempt for the technology and martial arts system of the Lang Shia Empire. In her words, the Lia Empire was like a giant that was strong on the outside but weak on the inside, relying entirely on a few top experts in the eighth and 9th realms who were already very old to keep it afloat.</p>
<p>Faced with the triple threat of extraterrestrial beasts, deep sea aliens, and the Federation, the demise of this ancient empire is only a matter of time. Shin Yuan listened to her long-winded speech, remaining outwardly calm but inwardly cursing her wildly. Sister, with your brainwashing skills, it&#x27;s a waste of your talent not to be involved in pyramid schemes. However, he had to admit that although the woman&#x27;s words were harsh, they made some sense. Just as Akasha&#x27;s fighter jet was about to cross the East China Sea defense line and enter the vast international waters, Shinuan&#x27;s heart was in his throat.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t help but scream inwardly. This isn&#x27;t how the script was written. Sister Lee, Uncle Xiao, where&#x27;s your backup plan? If you don&#x27;t come soon, I&#x27;m really going to be sold abroad like a pig. He had even begun to consider whether to use the martial arts essence left behind by the dragon soul jade to fight this female demon to the death. But at that very moment, the sky ahead suddenly darkened.</p>
<p>It was as if an invisible giant hand had covered the entire sky with a black curtain. No, it didn&#x27;t darken. Instead, a stunningly beautiful yet indescribably massive figure appeared silently thousands of meters above the ground. She just stood there quietly. She wore a crimson classical palace dress which fluttered in the strong wind.</p>
<p>That face, so beautiful it seemed otherworldly, was expressionless. Those phoenix eyes, which seemed to hold the very essence of the universe&#x27;s creation and destruction, gazed indifferently down at the toy-like fighter jets below. She was just a person yet she became the soul center of the entire world. Time, space, light, everything else lost its meaning before her. One of the five pillars of humanity, a national level martial emperor at the eighth realm.</p>
<p>The exquisite goddess of war, Jade exquisite arrive. Boom! Akasha&#x27;s mind exploded the moment she saw that figure. The noble, elegant, and composed smile on her face froze instantly. It immediately transformed into a deep-seated terror and disbelief. She screamed, her voice distorted and shrill with extreme fear.</p>
<p>Eighth realm Marshall emperor. That&#x27;s impossible for a man. For a mere third realm martial artist, they actually mobilized a national level expert. She couldn&#x27;t understand it. She couldn&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>This was completely beyond her comprehension. This doesn&#x27;t make sense. However, the exquisite war goddess high in the sky didn&#x27;t even bother to glance at her. Her indifferent gaze pierced through the fighter jet&#x27;s layers of armor and landed directly on Shun Yuan, who was also in a state of extreme shock inside the cockpit. Then, under the gaze of Akasha&#x27;s beautiful violet eyes filled with terror and despair.</p>
<p>The exquisite war goddess slowly raised her slender fair finger. He gently tapped the void below. There was no earthshattering noise. There were no earthshattering energy fluctuations. It was just a simple, understated gesture.</p>
<p>In an instant, the space within a radius of a 100 miles, including Akasha&#x27;s fighter jet, which was fleeing at three times the speed of sound, froze. Time seemed to have been paused at that moment. The fighter jet remained in a forward-leaning posture, and then, strangely, it came to a standstill in midair. Inside the cabin, the terror and horror on Akasha&#x27;s face were forever frozen in that moment. The power of a grandmaster at the peak of the fifth realm is as fragile as a joke under this one finger.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t even have the strength to move a single finger. Is this the strength of an eighth realm marshall emperor? Is this the absolute power that makes words law and can control heaven and earth with a single thought? She couldn&#x27;t even muster the slightest thought of resistance. Not because she didn&#x27;t want to, but because she dared not. Faced with absolute power, any struggle is feudal and may even lead to more terrible consequences. Akasha was sensible.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t the kind of stubborn fool. Faced with an insurmountable force, she chose the wisest course of action to give up all resistance and obediently surrender. She wasn&#x27;t even that flustered. Given her status as the heir to the Rothschild family. Even if the Dragon Summer Empire captured her, they wouldn&#x27;t dare to really do anything to her.</p>
<p>At most, they&#x27;ll be detained for a period of time, and then a long-running exchange of interests will be conducted through diplomatic channels. She still has a chance. As long as she lives, as long as she can return to the Federation, she will definitely repay the humiliation she suffered today 100fold. A thousandfold. Chapter 84.</p>
<p>The Countess is arrested. Her arrogance lasted only 3 seconds. The frozen state of space lasted for less than 3 seconds. When the terrifying pressure that could freeze the soul receded like a tide, Akasha&#x27;s private jet was already surrounded by dozens of Shien Bird fighters and hundreds of highle martial artists hovering in the air. The dark muzzles of cannons and the gleaming blades of weapons were aimed at the black rose which had no chance of escape from all directions.</p>
<p>Leun and Xiao Jingua appeared at the cabin door. Ms. Akasha von Rothschild. Lean looked at the stunningly beautiful countest on the sofa whose face was ashen but who still managed to maintain a last vestage of elegance and a victor&#x27;s smile appeared on her face. On behalf of Umbrella Corporation headquarters, I hereby formally arrest you.</p>
<p>Come with us. Akasha did not resist. She simply stretched, her movements still exuding allure, as if she were not a prisoner of war about to be taken prisoner, but a queen preparing to attend a banquet. She stood up and suddenly stopped as she passed Shinuan. She leaned down and under the gaze of his possessive violet eyes whispered in his ear in a seductive and suggestive voice that only the two of them could hear.</p>
<p>Young man, we will meet again soon. Next time, I promise you&#x27;ll experience a hundred times more thrilling pleasure than today. After saying that, she teased Shin Yuan gently in front of everyone. H Shin Yuan felt a jolt of electricity surge from his earlobe throughout his body, freezing him completely. What? That vixen? He&#x27;s about to get arrested and he still can&#x27;t resist provoking me.</p>
<p>Take away. Lie Yun gave a cold shout and two fully armed female special forces warriors immediately stepped forward, use speciallymade energy shackles to handcuff Akashas hands and then unceremoniously escorted her out. A tense and exciting manhunt has finally come to an end. Shinuan let out a long sigh of relief, feeling as if he had just walked through the gates of hell, completely exhausted. His back was already soaked with cold sweat.</p>
<p>You little rascal. Well done. Xiao Jingo walked over and slapped him hard on the shoulder. His usually stern face now showed undisguised admiration and joy. He remained calm in the face of danger, possessed both courage and wisdom, and even knew how to deceive the enemy in return, just like I did back in the day.</p>
<p>All right. All right. Stop patting yourself on the back. Lean rolled her eyes at him, then walked up to Shin Yuan, looking down at him with an even more pronounced, playful smile. Tell me, our company&#x27;s young master, how did you manage to control that countis? Shinyuans old face flushed red instantly.</p>
<p>What could he say? If this gets out, how will he ever be able to hold his head up in front of Longing and Sue Chingu again? Ahem. This is a secret not to be told to outsiders. Shin Yuan coughed twice, trying to bluff his way out of the situation. Oh, really? Leon smiled deepened. She took a miniature voice recorder out of her pocket and waved it in front of him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a live video recording of your conversation in the suite. Should I make this public now so that everyone can learn how our young master risked his life to hold off the enemy? There&#x27;s even CCTV recording. Do all the women in your umbrella corporation have a pinchant for eavesdropping? No, sisterly. I was wrong. I was really wrong.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan immediately cowered, grabbing Lean straight thigh and frantically begging for forgiveness. His shameless and roguish manner made Long Yings eyes twitch. This guy&#x27;s integrity has completely vanished. At first, Zhiao Jingwa found it funny. But as he watched, his face darkened.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s my wife. Damn it, you brat. With a roar, Zhiao Jingua grabbed Shin Yuan from Lie Yians lap like a chicken. Where are you putting your hands? Don&#x27;t you have a wife? He casually tossed Shin Yuan towards Natasha, who stood silently to the side. Shin Yuan stumbled and crashed solidly into the warm, soft embrace of a woman, his nose filled with a familiar fragrance.</p>
<p>Xiaoing pointed at Natasha and shouted angrily, &quot;She&#x27;s your wife. Go hug her.&quot; Shin Yuan was taken aback by the scolding, then looked down at Natasha in his arms. Shin Yuan pursed his lips, and the slight annoyance in his heart instantly vanished. He grabbed Natasha&#x27;s slender yet strong waist, pulling her closer into his arms, a smug, mischievous grin spreading across his face. &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; Chapter 85.</p>
<p>The Countess&#x27; imprisonment. Linglan&#x27;s question. Umbrella Corporation headquarters underground base Fortress 1. The heavy alloy door clicked shut behind Shin Yuan, completely isolating him from all outside, prying eyes and noise. The room was dark with only the cool moonlight streaming in through the huge bulletproof port holes, spreading a layer of silver frost on the floor.</p>
<p>Shinuan turned around, too lazy to say another word, and simply tossed aside the soft, fragrant body in his arms. H Natasha let out a suppressed groan. A few minutes later, the moonlight outside the window was obscured by the drifting dark clouds. At the same time, deep underground at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters in a tople confinement chamber made of a special alloy and engraved with countless energy runes, it is said to be able to withstand a full force attack from a seventh realm war emperor. Akasha von Rothschild, the blood rose countest who had just stirred up a blood bath over Donghai City, lay quietly on a cold metal bed.</p>
<p>Her gorgeous black velvet dress had long been replaced by an extremely plain white prison uniform. But this simple prison uniform worn on her stunningly beautiful body did not diminish her charm in the slightest. On the contrary, the stark contrast added a touch of forbidden beauty. Her limbs were firmly locked by four energy shackles flashing with blue electric arcs fixed to the four corners of the bed, making her whole body appear in a humiliating X shape. The powerful yuani of a grandmaster at the peak of the fifth realm within his body was temporarily sealed away by a fifth order gene locked specially made by Su Chingu.</p>
<p>Even as a prisoner, her beautiful face showed no trace of fear or despair. Those deep violet eyes still held that innate arrogance and composure as if what was imprisoned was merely a shell she disdained. Outside the closed room in front of a heavy observation window, Li Yun and Xiao Jing Wo were looking at the stunningly beautiful prisoner inside with serious expressions. This woman is so carefree, acting like she&#x27;s on vacation in her own backyard. Looking at Akasha&#x27;s leisurely and carefree appearance, Ziaoa couldn&#x27;t help but click his tongue.</p>
<p>Conventional interrogation methods probably wouldn&#x27;t even scratch an itch for her. It was more than useless. Lean&#x27;s expression was equally grave. I just tried to probe her with my mental energy, but as soon as I got close, I was bounced back by her powerful mental barrier. If I hadn&#x27;t retreated quickly, I probably would have ended up like that mental expert last time, almost becoming an idiot.</p>
<p>Just as the two were at their wits end, a melodious female voice, cold and devoid of any emotion, rang out behind them. She trespassed into the territory of my longshot kingdom, treating human life like dirt. This kind of federal noble should either be executed immediately as a warning to others or her property should be exchanged for an A-level energy territory. Are you planning to keep her here as a pet? The moment the sound rang out, the temperature of the surrounding air seemed to drop several degrees. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua froze abruptly, turning around as if they had been electrocuted.</p>
<p>When they saw the stunningly beautiful figure behind them, dressed in a crimson combat uniform whose mere presence seemed to freeze the entire space. They immediately bowed in unison, performing a perfectly standard salute. Exquisite war goddess. The newcomer was none other than Yuluing Long, one of the five pillars of the human race, who had just suppressed the entire scene with a single finger. She had appeared here silently without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>Yuling Long ignored their greetings. Her indifferent Phoenix eyes pierced through the observation window and landed on the countess in the confinement room, who also possessed unparalleled beauty. As if sensing that gaze, Akasha on the bed slowly turned her head, her violet eyes meeting Yu Ling Longs gaze, and a faint playful smile even appeared on her lips. It was as if invisible lightning flashed through the air. The exquisite war goddess, this woman has a special identity and immense value.</p>
<p>We believe, despite the almost suffocating pressure emanating from her, Le Yun forced herself to explain value. You Ling Long withdrew her gaze, a cold smile curving her lips. What value could a dead person have? Ling Long were God. Please let me explain. Li Yun took a deep breath, met Yu Lings cold gaze, and spoke her prepared remarks word by word.</p>
<p>By executing her, we will gain nothing but a sense of vindication. Trading her might yield some strategic resources, but for the overall war effort, it would be a drop in the ocean. But if Lean&#x27;s voice became incredibly solemn at this moment, can we win her over and make her completely body and soul become one of our umbrella corporation? Behind her, the Rothschild family&#x27;s global intelligence network, their immense wealth, and even her own future power will all serve as our protective umbrella. That would be an enormous benefit, enough to change the world order. These words caused a slight ripple in Yu Ling Longs icy gaze.</p>
<p>But in just a moment, that slight ripple was replaced by a deeper sarcasm. Subjugate. Yuling Long seemed to have heard the biggest joke in the world and let out a very soft but extremely disdainful sneer. Leun, do you think a man with only F-level talent can subdue a Grandmaster of the Fifth Realm who is ambitious and ruthless? On the path of martial arts, the strong are respected. An empire that relies solely on bloodlines for continuation is nothing but a castle on the beach.</p>
<p>It will crumble with the slightest breeze. Yu Ling Longs voice grew increasingly cold and piercing. The future of our umbrella corporation should be in the hands of true strong men who have fought their way up step by step with their own blood and sweat, not in the hands of a useless person lying on a woman&#x27;s belly. Faced with Linglongs merciless rebuke, Lie Yun and Ziao Jingwa didn&#x27;t dare to even breathe loudly. In the deathly silence, Li Yun, under the terrifying pressure of Mount Thai pressing down on her, raised her head and looked directly into Yu Ling Longs phoenix eyes that could freeze the soul, squeezing out her final trump card through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>This is the highest directive from above in the company. Chapter 86. The goddess of wars changing perspective. Are you the boss of your umbrella corporation? Upon hearing this, a ripple appeared in Yu Ling Long&#x27;s cold and unwavering Phoenix eyes. The terrifying killing intent that had permeated the entire space slowly subsided.</p>
<p>She still didn&#x27;t approve of the plan, which seemed absurd to her, but she couldn&#x27;t refuse to give face to that invincible rogue cultivator at the ninth realm. &quot;It&#x27;s that person again,&quot; Yuling Long murmured to herself. Her usually cold tone now carrying a rare hint of helplessness and respect. She stopped pursuing the matter of Akasha&#x27;s fate, which was tantamount to acquiescing to Leons plan. Then her indifferent Phoenix eyes fell on Li Yun again, her gaze now filled with genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>What about the man who was protected by your umbrella corporation? I want to see who he really is. This question instantly made Li Yun and Xiao Jingwas expressions extremely awkward. Ziao Jinguas eyes darted around, looking at the ceiling and then at his toes. Finally, he could only cough and point his finger tremblingly towards Shun Yuans presidential suite upstairs, his voice lower than a mosquito&#x27;s bus. He is working hard for the future of the Umbrella Corporation.</p>
<p>Struggle. Yuling Long was no ordinary person. She grasped the indescribable deeper meaning behind those two words almost instantly. For the first time, a fascinating expression appeared on her perpetually frozen, stunningly beautiful face. A mixture of amusement, speechlessness, and even deeper disdain.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t ask any more questions. Instead, she walked straight to the alloy sofa outside the detention room where people could rest and gracefully sat down, her skirt swaying. Lie Yun and Xiaoing were stunned. She spoke in a flat tone devoid of any emotion. Good.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;ll wait until he finishes his hard work. I want to see what kind of three heads and six arms this man has. Time passed second by second. The atmosphere in the corridor outside the confinement room was so oppressive that it was hard to breathe. Yuing Long sat quietly on the sofa, her eyes closed, her breath coming in long, drawn out gasps as if she were truly asleep.</p>
<p>However, Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua knew that this eighth realm marshall emperor, who was at the national level, had already enveloped the entire base with her divine sense, and no movement could escape her perception. The two stood to the side, feeling uneasy, and even deliberately slowed their breathing. Xiao Jing Wua was so anxious that sweat beated on his forehead and he kept glancing upstairs out of the corner of his eye. That brat, what&#x27;s he up to? The goddess of warling long is personally waiting for him here. Yet he&#x27;s still struggling up there.</p>
<p>If he angers this lady, she&#x27;ll slap him until he&#x27;s a pulp and he&#x27;ll have nowhere to cry. An hour has passed. Upstairs, it was still quiet without the slightest sound. Leun was also getting unsteady on her feet. She secretly sent a mental message to Su Chingu.</p>
<p>Her voice filled with anxiety. Ching Zu, what&#x27;s going on? Isn&#x27;t this over yet? The goddess of war, Ling Long, is still waiting down there. Soon, the door to Sue Ching Xus private laboratory opened. The crisp sound of high heels approached from afar. She was still wearing that spotless white lab coat, holding a tablet computer in her hand, and walked over with elegant cat-like steps, unhurried and leisurely.</p>
<p>Her face wore that signature sly smile that seemed to enjoy watching the drama unfold. Commander, don&#x27;t rush. There are too many Shinyong nuclear reactors. Suchinu walked to Lie side and pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses. However, Su Chingus performance was not over yet.</p>
<p>She abruptly changed the subject. Her beautiful eyes hidden behind her glasses suddenly falling on two equally anxious, icy figures not far away. Ling and L Yu. Unlike some people, Su Ching Xus voice, tinged with just the right amount of regret, rang out softly. Despite having a significant advantage and access to the empire&#x27;s most advanced resources, they have made no progress.</p>
<p>Her gaze first fell on Longing. Some people, aside from being influenced by external forces on the first day and losing control of themselves, take the initiative once. After that, they put on their warrior goddess persona again, waiting for the protagonist to beg and coax them every day. She treats washing her feet like it&#x27;s her life, showing absolutely no sense of responsibility as a wife. I strongly condemn this puff.</p>
<p>Xiao Jingua almost burst out laughing but quickly forced himself to hold it back. His face turning bright red. Long Yings already cold and pretty face suddenly turned red all the way to her ears. Her slender fists clenched so tightly they cracked and her icy phoenix eyes seemed to spit fire. Is this woman a devil? It&#x27;s bad enough that they spy on us everyday, but to say it out loud in front of so many people.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xu seemed oblivious to the murderous glare in her eyes and casually turned her gaze to L Yu on the other side. And then there&#x27;s another one who&#x27;s even more of a heavyweight. Taking advantage of her long legs and good figure, she would put on the sexiest black stockings every night and pace back and forth in front of Shin Yuan&#x27;s suite like a runway model. He couldn&#x27;t bring himself to break free of her icy demeanor and knocked on the door to go inside. I did a preliminary calculation and the distance she&#x27;s run back and forth these past few nights is enough to circle the entire headquarters of our umbrella corporation.</p>
<p>With that kind of perseverance and determination, it&#x27;s a waste that she&#x27;s not participating in a marathon. Boom. Lung Yu&#x27;s perpetually icy face was instantly covered with a blush of shame and indignation. Her always cold and sharp eyes stared intently at Su Ching Xu as if she wanted to freeze her into an ice sculpture on the spot. These two icy beauties with their contrasting personalities at this moment simultaneously roared the same anger from the depths of their hearts.</p>
<p>Is this woman a psychopath? The top professor of the Imperial Martial Arts Academy. Is her mouth really that gossipy? Just as the atmosphere in the entire corridor became extremely awkward due to Su Ching Xus precise finishing blow click. Upstairs, the door to the presidential suite, which had been tightly closed for a long time, finally opened. Under the complex gazes of everyone, Shin Yuan walked out of the room with a satisfied look on his face. In his arms, he was intimately embracing a stunningly beautiful woman who was equally radiant.</p>
<p>It was Natasha. She changed out of her smart flight suit and put on a black form-fitting leather dress that Shinuan had specially prepared for her. The leather skirt accentuated her already fiery and alluring figure, making her appear even more breathtaking and wild. The hidden injuries she suffered from the backlash of her spiritual power have mostly healed. At this moment, her skin was fair with a rosy glow, and her bright blue eyes were shimmering with moisture, adding a touch of allure to her appearance.</p>
<p>Like a completely tamed Persian cat, she nestled obediently in Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms. Shin Yuan held her in his arms, and as soon as he looked up, he saw the impressive crowd of onlookers downstairs. Li Yun, Xiao, Jingwa, Su Ching Xu, and Ling and L Yu, whose faces were so red they looked like they were about to bleed. Chapter 87. The God of Wars Misunderstanding.</p>
<p>A grand plan to conquer the nation. Shinuan put his arm around Natasha and greeted the various faces downstairs. Oh dear, sorry to keep you waiting, everyone. Unfortunately, since it concerned the future development of the Umbrella Corporation and the peaceful coexistence of our two camps, Comrade Natasha and I had to have an in-depth and frank exchange. He spoke these words with such high- sounding dignity without batting an eye.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Lie Yun, Ziaing Wa, and the others couldn&#x27;t help but twitch at the corners of their eyes, gaining a whole new understanding of the kid&#x27;s shamelessness. Su Ching Xu pushed up her glasses, her eyes behind the lenses gleaming with amusement as she looked at Natasha&#x27;s fair and rosy, radiant face with great interest, a cunning smile curving her lips. When Ling and Lyu heard the words deep exchange, their pretty faces flushed slightly, then turned cold again, and their gazes toward Shin Yuan held a hint of inexplicable shame and indignation. Shin Yuan, accompanied by Natasha, strolled downstairs with an air of nonchulance. When he stepped outside the confinement room, his gaze fell upon the stunningly beautiful figure sitting quietly on the sofa and he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p>What a nice view. Even though he was used to seeing beauties like Ling and Su Chingu, Shinuans heart still skipped a beat when he saw Yu Ling Long up close for the first time. She sat there quietly, dressed in a crimson classical palace gown that accentuated her snow white skin and exquisite features. She exuded no aura of power, truly like a fairy who stepped out of an ancient painting untouched by worldly affairs. But Shin Yuan knew that beneath this tranquility lay a terrifying power capable of destroying the world.</p>
<p>This is Yu Ling Long, the pillar of the Lang Shia Empire and an eighth realm Marshall Emperor. Seemingly sensing his gaze, Yuing Long slowly opened her in different Phoenix eyes. Last time in the secret room in Donghai City, she only glanced at him briefly and didn&#x27;t take Shen Yuan, this useless person with F-level talent, seriously at all. Not long ago, thousands of meters in the air, she only regarded him as an object that needed to be recycled. This was the first time she had truly looked at this young master on whom the Umbrella Corporation had placed such high hopes.</p>
<p>This sight stirred even her usually calm and composed mind. Her phoenix eyes, capable of seeing through all the illusions of the world, clearly saw the surging powerful blood and chi within Shun Yuan&#x27;s body, so immense and profound that it was completely unlike what a third realm martial artist should possess. She clearly remembered that more than half a month ago, in the information that ElderQin showed her, this boy named Shin Yuan was just an ordinary person who had just awakened his F-level talent and hadn&#x27;t even touched the threshold of a martial arts apprentice. But now the strength of his internal energy and blood was already approaching the late stage of the third realm martial artist. More than half a month from an ordinary person, he rose to become a powerful expert in the late stage of the quasi third realm.</p>
<p>What does this mean? This cultivation speed is much faster than that of her back then when she was a peerless genius with SSS level talent. Frank talent. For the first time, confusion appeared in Yuling Long&#x27;s eyes which had been frozen for a thousand years. Facts speak louder than words. Yuling Long looked at the young man in front of her, who was surrounded by women on both sides with a smug look on his face.</p>
<p>He even dared to stare at her with eyes that were both admiring and aggressive. The scales in her heart began to tip. Then she glanced at Natasha, the former Federation Ace agent in Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms, who was clearly completely conquered and exuded an aura of happiness as her master. A bold, outrageous, yet seemingly perfectly reasonable idea. quietly formed in her mind.</p>
<p>Could it be that the real purpose of Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s plan wasn&#x27;t internal strife? Or is it being exported? Use this man&#x27;s special abilities to turn and conquer female elites of hostile forces. Turn the enemy into our people. Then let them give birth to a bunch of the best offspring for the umbrella corporation who have the blood of high-ranking officials from enemy countries but are absolutely loyal to the company. H. Even with Yu Ling Longs knowledge and perspective, she was still taken aback by this thought.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s an incredibly generous gesture. This is no longer a conspiracy. This is an open conspiracy. It is a strategy capable of destroying a vast empire from its very foundation. Shin Yuan had no idea that his brief appearance had already prompted the eighth realm Marshall Emperor, a national level expert, to conjure up a grand plan to destroy the country.</p>
<p>He looked at Yu Ling Longs beautiful face, which was so stunning it seemed otherworldly and the everchanging wonderful expressions on it, and he couldn&#x27;t help but mutter to himself, &quot;Is this woman infatuated with her own handsomeness?&quot; However, the proper etiquette should not be neglected. He released Natasha from his embrace, stepped forward, and respectfully bowed to Yu Ling Long. Then, in a serious tone, he began to defend himself for being late. reporting to the goddess of war, Ling Long. The incident happened so suddenly that in order to obtain the highest level core secrets of the Federation, I had to give comrade Natasha an emergency and in-depth ideological education.</p>
<p>The enemy&#x27;s willpower was extremely stubborn. I could only break through her psychological barrier by using highintensity, close contact, and repeated persuasion methods. This matter concerns the company&#x27;s long-term future, and every second counts. I sincerely apologize for taking up your valuable time. His words left Lie Yun, Xiao, Jingua, Su Ching Xu, and the others standing nearby completely stunned.</p>
<p>Ziao raised his hand and covered his face, unable to bear to look. Leun was so angry she wanted to bite him. If it weren&#x27;t for the inappropriate occasion, she would have kicked the kid. Ideological education and it&#x27;s in death. We were downstairs waiting for you for a whole hour.</p>
<p>Is that what you call moral education? You&#x27;re just lusting after her body. You&#x27;re despicable. Even Natasha&#x27;s already rosy face nearly bled when she heard Shin Yuans words. She had long known that her master was shameless. But she never expected him to be this shameless.</p>
<p>What no one expected was after hearing Shun Yuans shameless excuse, Yuling Longized something. She completely connected Shin Yuans words with Li Yans previous hints, Natasha&#x27;s current presence, and Countess Akasha, who was locked in the solitary confinement room. In an instant, a complete, clear, and imaginative grand plan took shape in her mind. High intensity, close contact, and repeated methods of persuasion. Yuing Long silently recited these words in her heart, a hint of understanding flashing in her cold phoenix eyes.</p>
<p>So, this is the code name for the defection process. Chapter 88. Natasha&#x27;s defenses crumble. Shin Yuans confidence source. In Yu Ling Longs heart, she felt a genuine respect for the shrewd and resourceful old Chin.</p>
<p>When she looked at Shin Yuan again, her gaze had completely changed. Initially, it was disdain and contempt. Only then did scrutiny and curiosity develop. This kid looks glib and his actions are utterly vulgar. But his very existence is a strategic weapon capable of shaking up the world order.</p>
<p>I see. Yulu Ling Long nodded slightly, and on her beautiful face, which had been frozen for thousands of years, she revealed a faint expression to Lie Yun that was almost imperceptible. Yet, it was an unprecedentedly kind expression. &quot;I no longer oppose this plan.&quot; She paused, her gaze sweeping across the direction of the solitary confinement cell, her tone returning to its usual chilling coldness. &quot;That countest is entirely at your disposal.</p>
<p>Remember, keep your hands clean and don&#x27;t leave any future problems for the Umbrella Corporation. As soon as she finished speaking, her figure faded away on the spot like a drop of water dissolving into the air, disappearing without causing the slightest ripple. They came silently and left without a trace. They so readily and decisively accepted Lean&#x27;s humiliating defection plan. Call.</p>
<p>Only when the oppressive force that had almost frozen the air completely dissipated did everyone in the corridor exhale a long breath as if they had just been pulled out of deep water. My own mother scared me to death. Xiao Jing was slumped onto the alloy sofa, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. His heart was still pounding. I thought the Linglong War god was really going to lose her temper and tear this kid apart on the spot.</p>
<p>All right, crisis resolved. Lean was also shaken. She walked up to Shin Yuan and glared at him angrily. You&#x27;ve got some nerve, kid. You dare to try and fool even the goddess of war to her face? Don&#x27;t you care about your life? Shin Yuan chuckled, reached out, and put his arm around Natasha&#x27;s slender waist, kissed her on the cheek, and looked completely indifferent.</p>
<p>Shamelessness, can that thing win you a beautiful woman&#x27;s heart? All right, now that things are settled with the god of waring longing quickly regained his authority as the company&#x27;s boss, he stood up from the sofa, waved his hand to gather everyone together, and his expression turned serious. Now, let&#x27;s talk about the next and most crucial topic. What should we do with that countest? Akasha von Rothschild. The moment the name was mentioned, the slightly relaxed atmosphere became heavy again. This is no small fry like Natasha.</p>
<p>This is a real deep sea giant shark that could stir up the storm and transform into a dragon at any moment. Let&#x27;s stick to the old method. Li Yun spoke first using the company supplied Sarif&#x27;s breath to destroy her will once her mental defenses crumble finding out anything would be a piece of cake. No. Her suggestion was rejected on the spot without any mercy by Su Ching Zu.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xu pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, her eyes behind the lenses gleaming with rationality. While the breath of the serif is powerful, its effects are significantly reduced for grand masters of the fifth realm. Moreover, Akasha&#x27;s mental strength far surpasses that of other martial artists of the same level. And given her Rothschild family background, her willpower is far more resolute than Natasha&#x27;s. If the medication provokes a desperate resistance from her, given her peak fifth realm strength, if she chooses to destroy her spiritual core, then all our efforts will have been in vain.</p>
<p>Suching words silenced everyone. Indeed, when dealing with a powerhouse of this caliber, any slight oversight could lead to total defeat. Just when everyone was at a loss, Su Chingus gaze suddenly fell on Natasha, who was obediently massaging Shun Yuan&#x27;s shoulders. That devilishly charming smile reappeared on her intellectual face. However, based on the valuable clinical experience we gained from Natasha, she deliberately emphasized the pronunciation of the phrase clinical experience.</p>
<p>For elite agents like them who have received top level training, what they fear most is never physical torture. Rather, it is the extreme humiliation and powerlessness of watching one&#x27;s pride and dignity and will being crushed bit by bit while in a state of absolute consciousness. Natasha, who was massaging Shin Yuan&#x27;s back, suddenly lost her grip when she heard that she was being used as a negative example for public humiliation. She felt as if her toes had awkwardly carved out of her sigh palace inside her high heels. Her mind was screaming wildly.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Dr. Suchia. You still remember me, and in front of so many people, they praised me for my strong will. Thank you so much, your whole family. May every mouse in your lab be smarter than you.</p>
<p>Such seemed oblivious to Natasha&#x27;s near breakdown expression and continued to deliver the final solution in the same cold tone, as if she were reading an experimental report. Therefore, we will not use medicine this time. Her gaze slowly fell on Shun Yuan. her eyes filled with frantic anticipation and a hint of encouragement that only Shin Yuan could understand. Let&#x27;s have Mr.</p>
<p>Shin go in. Let her experience firsthand what it means to be helplessly desperate when she is at her most lucid, proud, and arrogant. Believe me, for a queen like Akasha, who sees men as mere play things, nothing could destroy her pride more than being consciously and wantingly violated in front of a man she despises. Upon hearing this, everyone present turned their gaze to shun you on. After hearing Su Ching Xus vicious plan, Shinuan felt no pressure whatsoever, and the corners of his mouth couldn&#x27;t help but turn up in a smile.</p>
<p>He released Natasha, straightened his collar, and then stroed confidently toward the solitary confinement cell where the peerless enchantress was imprisoned with an arrogant and doineering air. Rest assured, without turning his head, he waved to the group of people behind him, whose expressions varied. dealing with this kind of woman who says one thing but means another whose body language tells a different story. I&#x27;m a professional. Chapter 89.</p>
<p>The countest who suffered a great humiliation. Inside the confinement room, Akasha lay quietly on the cold alloy bed. The black velvet dress that was previously adorned with dark patterns and shimmering colors had been stripped away, replaced by a plain white prison uniform that was old and worn with even the stitching slightly rough. The collar was loose. The material was thin.</p>
<p>and there was nothing to embellish it with. Yet, this extremely simple prison uniform like a precise carving knife accentuated her stunningly beautiful body, making her even more breathtaking. Her full curves could support her former glory, and her slender waist appeared even more supple under the simple fabric. Even covered by plain cloth, her per curves could not hide their sharpness, creating a stark contrast between the pinnacle of her glory and her current state of utter desolation. Every curve exudes a deadly contrasting tension.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s worse, those black lace stockings, torn beyond recognition, were still on her incredibly long, plump, and straight legs. Her fifth order gene lock made her no different from an ordinary person at the moment, unable to mobilize even a trace of vital energy. When she saw Shin Yuan push the door open and enter, her beautiful violet eyes, which always carried a sense of laziness and arrogance, showed no fear or panic. Instead, they suddenly lit up. In those eyes, there was anticipation, amusement, and undisguised provocation.</p>
<p>Cluck, cluck, she let out a silvery laugh, her voice filled with the ultimate allure of a mature woman. Young master, have they finally decided to let you in? She slightly twisted her bound yet still incredibly voluuptuous and alluring body, and with an extremely seductive posture, she extended her scarlet tongue and licked her fiery red lips towards Shinuan. Bring it on. Tell me, how do you intend to desecrate this garment that even the Federation&#x27;s Marshall Emperor desires day and night? Looking at her submissive and even begging to be ravaged appearance, Shinuan could only sneer inwardly. Simple and crude methods simply cannot truly subdue her proud heart that is proud to the core.</p>
<p>Shinuan looked down at the peerless enchantress who was looking at him with expectant eyes. He didn&#x27;t rush at her as Akasha had expected. He looked down at her alluring red lips. Hm. Akasha&#x27;s pupils suddenly contracted.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she was shocked to discover that her body, mind, and even her blood were utterly powerless to resist. She wanted Shinuan to immediately become her man. How so? She found it strange. Both times it was merely a mechanical operation to implant a mental imprint and to achieve her ambition of becoming the new queen of the family. But now, when the man is reversed, that strange attraction is 10 times 100 times stronger.</p>
<p>Because of this man&#x27;s unique allure, her heart, which had been beating with ambition, for the first time genuinely and urgently wanted to be with him. A few minutes later, looking at the stunningly beautiful woman whose entire body was flushed with an alluring blush, Shin Yuan revealed a satisfied smile as if he had successfully pulled off a prank. In Akasha&#x27;s gaze filled with astonishment and confusion, he slowly and methodically straightened his somewhat disheveled clothes. Then Akasha suddenly realized the man&#x27;s perverse sense of humor. Overwhelmed by a sense of humiliation, the queen&#x27;s dignity forbade her to make any gesture of begging, but the body&#x27;s instincts betrayed reason.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Shinuan turned and left. Bang! The door to the solitary confinement cell was slammed shut. Akasha! She was completely stunned. What kind of operation is this? The enormous psychological gap and the immense humiliation of being treated like a monkey erupted like a volcano, instantly shattering her proud rationality. A dash.</p>
<p>Inside the confinement room came the countess&#x27;s scream filled with endless anger and humiliation. Ding. Target Akasha has been detected to be experiencing extreme mental humiliation and psychological distress. Submission value plus 15%. Current progress 40%.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the notification sound in his mind, Shin Yuan, who had just stepped out of the confinement room, grinned from ear to ear. Really? To deal with this kind of queen, you have to use this kind of psychological humiliation. Chapter 90. The path to conquest. As soon as Shun Yuan stepped out of the confinement room, the heavy alloy door closed silently behind him.</p>
<p>In the corridor, Li Yun, Su Ching, Xu, Longing, and L Yu for tall and graceful figures, all looked over at him. Their scrutinizing gazes were like for scalpels, trying to dissect him from the inside out. More than half an hour, the first to make a move was Su Ching Xhu, holding the pair of magnificent human nuclear weapons. She leaned against the cold wall, her beautiful eyes behind the gold rimmed glasses displaying a half smile. I thought you&#x27;d stay a little longer this time, but you still came out.</p>
<p>These outrageous words made Long Yings ears burn. A thin layer of anger rose on her cold, pretty face as she glared fiercely at Su Ching Zhu. This female demon is getting more and more outrageous with her words. Upon hearing this, Shinuan, he stepped forward with a serious expression and corrected her righteously. Dr.</p>
<p>Sue, your thinking is too narrow and your perspective is too limited. What I just said was strategy. It was psychological warfare. Do you even know what playing hard to get or mind control means? Seeing Su Ching Xus I don&#x27;t believe you expression, Shin Yuan began to speak seriously and eloquently. To deal with a queen like Akasha, who thinks highly of herself and treats men as play things.</p>
<p>Mere physical intimacy will only make her think that we are no different from those stinky men lining up to get into her bed. He became more and more excited as he spoke, pointing in the direction of the solitary confinement cell and then to his own head, his face full of confident shrewdness. She wants my jeans. I want her to know that in this game, I am the one in control. True conquest is to instill fear in her spirit.</p>
<p>To make her feel absolute awe and fear of me, both in terms of bloodline and strength. So, the most urgent thing is not to keep going in and wasting time with her or to play any kissing games with her. Instead, it&#x27;s about improving my own abilities. Only when I become so powerful that she has no right to even look up to me will she truly and willingly beg for my favor. These words were spoken with great passion and conviction.</p>
<p>Lie Yun and Su Chingu, who were standing nearby, were both taken aback. Then their eyes, which were fixed on Shun Yuan, showed a hint of genuine approval. Good lad. Who would have thought that someone who usually seems so carefree would actually be so damn smart when it really matters? Suching was also stunned by Shun Yuans profound words. Then her beautiful eyes behind her glasses shown with an increasingly bright light.</p>
<p>What this kid said seems to make a lot of sense. While everyone was still savoring Shu Yuans path to conquest, Shin Yuan, however, could not wait any longer. Before he finished speaking, without saying a word, he turned around and grabbed Ling and Lung Yus smooth wrists with one hand each. Then, amidst the two women&#x27;s bewildered and embarrassed gazes, he forcibly dragged them toward the training room. They&#x27;re off.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re off. Daily training can&#x27;t be neglected. Double the training today. Longing and L, you were forcibly dragged away by him. The former had an icy expression while the latter remained expressionless.</p>
<p>But the subtle blush on their ears betrayed the turmoil in their hearts. Inside the training room, the familiar push-up routine begins again. Shiny yuan lay down with practiced ease, then whistled at the two stunningly beautiful, icy beauties beside him whose styles were quite different but equally breathtaking. Come on, instructors, we&#x27;re counting on you to carry the weights today. Shinuan was taken down by Shunhi again.</p>
<p>The next second, Shin Yuan felt so happy that he almost fainted on the spot. What are you waiting for? Do push-ups. Long Yings icy voice rang out from above. Oh. Shin Yuan seemed to wake from a dream and immediately began today&#x27;s hellish training.</p>
<p>Training is over. The half-dead Shin Yuan was once again unceremoniously thrown into the medicinal bathtub filled with an eerie purple aura, which Su Chingu had prepared by the murderousl looking longing and the icyfaced L Yu. Shinuan felt that he had reached the pinnacle of his life. Even a god couldn&#x27;t replace you. The medicinal bath was filled with steam.</p>
<p>Shiny yuan and longing faced each other, palms facing each other. The golden dragon soul power along with the vast primordial energy within him mixed with the bloodline of the dragon completed one perfect cycle after another in their meridians. Lungu stared in shock at this unbelievable scene. Strands of dragon energy visible to the naked eye and radiating a faint golden halo were continuously flowing from Shun Yuan&#x27;s body into Lyings body. L Yings bottleneck at the peak of the fourth realm of Grand Marshall Master, which had been as solid as a rock and had stagnated for a long time, actually showed a very slight loosening under the impact of these golden dragon energies.</p>
<p>even if it&#x27;s just a trace. But for a powerful individual like L Yu, who was also at a bottleneck, this slight loosening was like seeing a ray of dawn in endless darkness. She suddenly understood everything. The only opportunity to break through the fifth realm does not lie in those elucory elixirs, nor in those so-called secret realm inheritances. It was in the man right in front of them.</p>
<p>Chapter 91. The ice sculpture beauty lung you put on a Chong Sam. After the medicinal bath, the training room filled with steam, was a mess. Longing Chang had just climbed out of the bathtub, which was soaked with sweat and medicine, and put on his black, tight fitting undergarments. Before he could even put on his coat, a dark figure pounced on him.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; She gasped in surprise as Shun Yuan swept her up in his arms, easily lifting her up. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Shin yuan steadily supported her smooth back with one hand while his other hand held a mischievous grin. All her struggles were in vain. Instructor Long, training isn&#x27;t over yet. Shinuan lowered his head, and breathed warm air into her ear.</p>
<p>Back at Fortress 1, in Lyings private suite, Shin Yuan kicked open the door, stroed to the bedside, and placed the icy beauty in his arms on the edge of the bed. As soon as Longing sat down, she tried to pull her legs back. However, Shinuan did not give her that chance. He ignored her murderous, humiliated gaze and went into the bathroom. soon returning with a basin of perfectly warm water.</p>
<p>&quot;What exactly do you want to do?&quot; Longing watched as he placed the basin of water at her feet, and the ominous premonition in her heart grew stronger. Shinuan squatted down, looked up at her, and his smile became even more smug. Su Ching Xus words during the day had deeply penetrated the heart of this female war goddess of the empire. &quot;Instructor Long,&quot; &quot;Your feet are too dirty.&quot; He declared, using a self-righteous robber-like logic. As your man, it is my duty to help you get clean.</p>
<p>Want to wash your feet again? Long Yings mind went blank. She was about to kick someone, but her body wouldn&#x27;t obey her commands. Her pride brooks no questioning. Her awareness should not be inferior to that of an ordinary girl. It&#x27;s just washing your feet, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s no big deal.</p>
<p>Longing clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging deep into her palms. She turned her head away, no longer looking at Shin Yuan. Hurry up. I&#x27;m ordering you to hurry up. Hey.</p>
<p>Hey. Shiny Yuan smiled triumphantly. Su Ching Xus divine intervention broke through the last layer of shame on this iceberg. They began their daily routine of providing services with a strong sense of ritual. Long Yings feet, which were originally as white as ice and jade, were now covered with a beautiful pink color and glistening with water droplets.</p>
<p>Under the soft light of the bedroom, they looked exceptionally delicate and fragile. Seeing her angry but unable to speak out, only able to stare at him with her misty phoenix eyes, Shin Yuans hot breath brushed against her ear, his voice like a devil&#x27;s whisper. &quot;Now, let&#x27;s begin the real physical training,&quot; instructor Long. Before long, Ing could react. He was like a tiger that had been starving for days.</p>
<p>Shinyuan couldn&#x27;t help but smile. Her strikingly beautiful face, tinged with a rare weariness and a blush of satiated pleasure, exuded an even more feminine charm than usual. Shinuan smiled with satisfaction. With a thought, he brought up Long Ying system panel. Target: Longing.</p>
<p>Age: 22. Talent: Dragon Soul Battle Body SS rank. Realm fourth realm Grand Marshall Master Peak. Appearance rating 97. Dragon born god-like beauty.</p>
<p>Body type rating 95. Perfect curves. Number of times 78. Affection level 95%. Deeply in love.</p>
<p>22 more attempts needed. Shin Yuan grinned looking at Longing, who was sleeping soundly with her brows relaxed, and thought to himself. It seems she won&#x27;t be able to go for her morning exercise today. He carefully lifted the covers, preparing to get out of bed. I must go to the restaurant now and enjoy a giant high energy breakfast specially made by Su Ching Zu to replenish my energy.</p>
<p>However, as soon as he stepped out of the room, he bumped into a figure who was also about to leave. It is a cold moon. Shinuan was about to greet him with a smile, but his eyes froze the next second. Is the woman in front of him still the ice sculpture beauty he remembers, exuding an aura that keeps strangers at bay? At this moment, she was no longer the aloof, icy instructor who seemed untouched by worldly affairs. She was clearly a top tier female hunter, ready to hunt her prey in the urban jungle.</p>
<p>Chapter 92. The hunter&#x27;s bait. The chase. Shin Yuan stood frozen in place, his gaze fixed on Lung Yu as if nailed to her, unable to look away even a fraction. This woman is acting strange today.</p>
<p>She took off her unchanging women&#x27;s business suit and put on a black bodycon minikirt that was so tight it couldn&#x27;t be tighter. The skirt was ridiculously short, outlining the curves of her per and rounded buttocks to the extreme and any movement seemed to be pushing the fabric to its limits. Her upper body was covered by a similarly tight white shirt with the top two buttons inadvertently undone, revealing a patch of snow white and delicate skin and a proud cleavage that had become quite impressive after undergoing a national level breast augmentation project. The most deadly thing is that her incredibly long legs, which are at least 1.2 m long, are actually covered with a layer of ultra thin black stockings as thin as cicada wings. On her feet were a pair of black stiletto heels that could drive any man crazy with the toes of her perfect feet exposed.</p>
<p>She even wore light makeup, and her usually cold and sharp eyes were now made even more long and charming by the eyeliner. Her fiery red lips made her exude a fatal sense of contradiction, a fusion of ice and fire. What? Shinuan&#x27;s brain completely shut down in that instant. This is not the same icy female officer who could freeze you to death. This outfit is clearly the ultimate weapon designed to seduce men.</p>
<p>A strong unpleasant feeling instantly welled up in Shun Yuans heart. What is she planning to do dressed like that? Who are you trying to seduce? Lung Yu met his intensely possessive gaze. His icy face showed no emotion, but a barely perceptible smile of a victor appeared at the corner of his mouth. Morning. She parted her red lips slightly and uttered a single word.</p>
<p>Her voice was still as clear and cold as ever. Yet, it was like a feather gently scratching Shun Yuans eardrums. Shiny Yuan was about to ask, &quot;Why are you dressed like this?&quot; Before she could even ask the question, Lyu had already turned around and walked with elegant and alluring cat-like steps straight toward the base&#x27;s exit. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Shiny Yuan cursed under his breath, feeling that the cabbage he had carefully cultivated for so long, which was about to mature, was about to be eaten by wild boars outside. How the hell can we tolerate this system? What&#x27;s her willingness score? He roared inwardly.</p>
<p>Ding. Target lung use current willingness level. 90%. 90%. It&#x27;s ready to be harvested anytime.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, what else could she be doing but going out dressed like that if not looking for some random man? Shinuan felt that the top of his head was beginning to turn faintly green. No, we absolutely cannot let her go out. He made a decision instantly. He had to follow. he said to himself righteously.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not jealous. I&#x27;m doing this to protect Umbrella Corporation strategic assets so they don&#x27;t go to waste. Yes, that&#x27;s it. Shinyuan found himself a perfect excuse. And without thinking, he followed after them from a distance.</p>
<p>He followed behind Lyu, but his gaze was uncontrollably drawn to her swaying hips and those incredibly long legs that looked even straighter and longer under the black stockings. He had to admit that this woman dressed like that was simply an absolute beauty straight out of a man&#x27;s fantasy. That chillingly cold demeanor paired with that extremely hot outfit creates a deadly contrast. While Lung Yu walking ahead seemed oblivious to the burning gaze behind her. In reality, everything was under her control.</p>
<p>He felt the burning gaze behind him which was brazenly scanning him up and down. A smug smile appeared on her lips. They&#x27;ve taken the bait. Lung Yu thought coldly to herself. Yesterday, Su Ching Xus sarcastic remarks about walking around the base were like a needle, piercing her proud self-esteem.</p>
<p>Later, during the medicinal bath, she witnessed firsthand how Shun Yuan&#x27;s dragon energy helped Longing loosen her bottleneck, which made her realize that this man was her hope for breaking through to the fifth realm. She thought about it all night. Like Longing, no, that would be too pathetic. Like Natasha, would she completely become a man&#x27;s appendage and play thing? She couldn&#x27;t do that. She L Yu is going to take the lead in this game.</p>
<p>Since you can&#x27;t bring yourself to offer yourself up, then let the prey pounce on you. She had studied the psychological models Su Chingu had given her. This man was powerful and mysterious, but in essence, he was still a vigorous young man driven by primal possessiveness. What she had to do was precisely locate the switch that could detonate him and then press it without hesitation. Just when Shin Yuan thought she was really going to leave the base to find the so-called wild man, suddenly Lung Yu turned at the next intersection and headed towards the upscale restaurant that was exclusively for the group of them.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan was completely dumbfounded. What the hell? Dressed up like this just to have a meal at a restaurant? What trick is she playing? Filled with doubt, Shin Yuan followed L Yu into the restaurant. Lyn Shuran and Natasha were already inside the restaurant. The warm morning atmosphere froze the moment L Yu pushed open the door. Lynn Sharon was sipping her milk when she saw Ly Yus outfit.</p>
<p>Her hand holding the cup paused almost imperceptibly, and then her gentle smile returned to her face, though with a hint of awkwardness. Natasha, like a cat whose territory had been invaded, narrowed her azure eyes slightly, subtly scrutinizing Lyu from her potentially lethal high heels to the deliberately open. As a woman herself, she instantly understood the meaning behind that battle robe, a declaration of war. Invisible sparks crackled and popped in the air. Shinuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat, and his scalp tingled.</p>
<p>He immediately tore his gaze away from Lung used long legs that could make his nose bleed and then casually stroed over to Lin Sharon and sat down next to her. His movement so natural that it was as if the pervert who had been following her around, drooling, was not him at all. Chapter 93. Cold Moon&#x27;s provocation. Shin Yuan reached out to touch Lin Chur&#x27;s slightly protruding belly and asked with concern.</p>
<p>Chur, how are you feeling today? Did the baby kick you? Lynn Chur blushed, gently slapped away his restless hand, and scolded him in a low voice. Stop fooling around. Sister Natasha and Sister Lingua are watching. Her gaze swept across the opposite side without leaving a trace. Lung Yu acted as if nothing had happened, as if she hadn&#x27;t seen anything, and sat down directly opposite Shin Yuan with an icy expression.</p>
<p>It was Lin Char, the gentle and kind empress, who took the initiative to break the delicate silence. She gave Lyu and Natasha a gentle smile. Sister Natasha, Sister Lingua, please sit down and eat with us. Today&#x27;s breakfast is very plentiful. Thank you, Miss Lynn.</p>
<p>Natasha replied respectfully and sat down in the seat next to her. Lung Yu simply nodded slightly in response. She cradled her beautiful, aloof face in one hand, and with the other, she elegantly picked up a knife and fork, slowly and methodically cutting the fiery beef on her plate. Every movement seemed precisely calculated, her elegance impeccable. Then she crossed her legs.</p>
<p>Her perfect jade-like foot, clad in ultra thin black stockings and stiletto heels, swayed gently under the table. The toes of his shoes brushed against Shun Yuan&#x27;s calves intentionally or unintentionally again and again. The cool silky touch transmitted through the fabric of his trousers felt like a faint electric current causing Shun Yuan&#x27;s body to stiffen abruptly. He suddenly looked up and met Lyus eyes, which were full of provocation and amusement. He was now 100% certain that this woman was doing it on purpose.</p>
<p>She saw herself as her prey. This realization did not offend him. On the contrary, it stirred up an extremely strong desire to conquer from the bottom of his heart. Interesting. That&#x27;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Husband Lynn Sharon seemed completely unaware of the undercurrents beneath the table. She asked with some concern, &quot;Where&#x27;s Sister Longing? Why didn&#x27;t she come for breakfast? Is she not feeling well?&quot; Upon hearing this question, Shin Yuan snapped out of his revery, which was locked in a staring contest with Lung Yu. He leaned close to Lynn Sharon&#x27;s ear and said with a wicked grin. She trained so hard last night that she couldn&#x27;t get out of bed. As he spoke, he gently pinched Lynn Sharon&#x27;s cheek.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon&#x27;s pretty face flushed red instantly. Natasha, standing to the side, gave a knowing, sympathetic smile, but inwardly she was secretly astonished. What a terrifyingly energetic monster. Just then, suddenly, Lung Yu, who was opposite her, let out a very soft exclamation. The fork in her hand seemed to slip from her fingers as if she hadn&#x27;t held it properly, and with a clatter, it rolled precisely to Shun Yuans feet.</p>
<p>Feel sorry. Her tone was flat and emotionless. Before Shinyuan could speak, she bent down to pick it up. Shinyuan also lowered his head subconsciously, and so the vibrant scene under the table. She&#x27;s definitely seducing me.</p>
<p>The intense visual impact coupled with the alluring scent emanating from her, a subtle blend of high-end perfume and feminine fragrance, made Shin Yuan feel parched and his body burning. Lung Yu picked up the fork from the ground. As she stood up, her soft, short hair gently brushed against Shun Yuan&#x27;s cheek. She leaned close to his ear and whispered in a husky voice, tinged with a coldness and a hint of provocation, a voice only the two of them could hear. Did you see anything you liked? This is a naked, undisguised challenge.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan sat up straight, his heart pounding uncontrollably, looking at this audacious woman who dared to openly provoke him in front of his wife and made. His competitive spirit was completely ignited. I saw it. He leaned close to her ear, responding to her teasing with his hot breath. A training uniform that fits perfectly.</p>
<p>He paused, the curve of his lips growing increasingly wicked, but he didn&#x27;t know if it was solid or not. For the first time, a beautiful blush appeared on Lu&#x27;s usually cold and aloof face, but her eyes remained defiantly defiant. That depends on whether you have the ability. The dinner ended in this ambiguous and tense atmosphere. As soon as they stepped out of the restaurant, Lyu called out to Shun Yuan.</p>
<p>She resumed her icy tone as if the enchantress who had been teasing him with her toes under the table just moments before was not her at all. Today is Monday and there are less than 20 days left until the start of the battle of the prodigies. Continue your training. Shinuan looked at her completely bewildered. Training? You&#x27;re dressed like that? What are we training for? He looked Lung Yu up and down admiring her sexy outfit that could turn any man into a beast and couldn&#x27;t help but tease her.</p>
<p>Instructor Lingua, are you dressed like that for the Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion show? What are you practicing? Your catwalk or how to kill with your eyes? Faced with Shun Yuans teasing, a tiny smile appeared on Lung Yus icy face. &quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; she responded in a matter-of-fact tone. &quot;A true strong person must be able to maintain their absolute true self in any environment and under any interference. On the battlefield of the Battle of the Prodigies, your opponents won&#x27;t wait for you to be ready before making their move. They will use every means to influence your mind.</p>
<p>This naturally includes using their femininity.&quot; She paused, her eyes sharpening. I&#x27;m giving you stress training in advance so you can adapt to the most intense battlefield environment. What? Shinyuan was rendered speechless by her seemingly serious yet twisted logic. This woman really knows how to come up with the most outrageous excuses to achieve her goals. He found it increasingly interesting.</p>
<p>I see. Shinuan slapped his thigh, a look on his face that said, I can&#x27;t believe you. Instructor Long was so insightful. I was so naive. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</p>
<p>Today, let me experience firsthand just how resilient your stress resistance training really is. Instructor Lung Yu Chapter 94 Black Silk Training Medicated Bath. Inside the training room, to Shun Yuan&#x27;s surprise, Lyu really hadn&#x27;t changed her clothes. She was still wearing that tight-fitting bodycon miniskirt and ultra thin black stockings along with stiletto heels that could crush a man&#x27;s dignity. As usual, push-ups, sit-ups, and squats.</p>
<p>The three-piece set, 500 of each. Let&#x27;s begin. Lung Yu crossed her arms and looked coldly at Shen Yuan, her tone suggesting that she was the one in charge here. Shin Yuan pursed his lips and effortlessly laid down on the cold floor. As soon as he got into position, an intoxicating scent, a mixture of perfume, and a woman&#x27;s natural fragrance, wafted over him.</p>
<p>Lung Yu actually did it, wearing high heels and completely unreasonable, using Shin Yuan as a bench. Concentrate. Lung Yus icy voice rang out above him. Oh Shinyuan cursed under his breath and began doing push-ups like crazy. But this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>His mind was no longer on training. Finally, squats. She even brought her fiery red lips close to his ear and breathed. How was the weight training? Are you satisfied with it? This training was of no intensity whatsoever to Shan Yuan&#x27;s body. But for his spirit and willpower, every minute and every second was torture.</p>
<p>After training, Shinuan looked at the icy fairy in front of him, whose breathing was steady and who hadn&#x27;t even broken a sweat, and his competitive spirit surged up wildly. &quot;Your willpower is lacking.&quot; Looking at his panting, but still aggressive gaze, Lyu&#x27;s own eyes flashed with a competitive glint. You need more in-depth training. After saying that, she turned and walked towards the medicinal bath house without looking back, her high heels clicking on the ground. Tap tap tap.</p>
<p>The crisp sound of high heels clicking on the ground felt like stepping on Shun Yuans heartbeat with each sound. Watching her departing figure, the curve of her hips tightly wrapped in a short skirt swayed dramatically with every step she took along with her long, straight, and slender legs and black stockings, exuding both a strong sense of power and an alluring beauty. Shinyuan&#x27;s mind flashed back to Longing last night. This woman is imitating Longing. She turned what should have been humiliating tactics into blatant seduction.</p>
<p>Want to be a hunter? Shinyuan licked his slightly dry lips, his eyes blazing with fury. Very well. Today, I&#x27;ll show you who the real hunter is. Go to the medicine bath house. The entrance to the medicine bath house.</p>
<p>Such was already waiting there. When she saw Shin Yuan and Lyu walking towards her one after the other, she immediately revealed an ambiguous and cunning smile. Wow. Working this hard on Monday. Her gaze lingered on Lyu&#x27;s sexy and alluring combat outfit for three seconds before she winked at Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Cold Moon, your gear is quite lethal. Looks like our little hero is in for a tough day. Shin Yuan was surprised by Su Ching Xus appearance, but Lyu seemed to have expected it. Her face expressionless. Dr.</p>
<p>Su, thank you for your help. Lung Yus voice remained icy. No trouble at all. Serving Young Master Shan is my duty. As Such Ching Xu spoke, she skillfully began to prepare today&#x27;s medicinal bath.</p>
<p>She poured various colored potions into the huge bathtub, winked at Shin Yuan, and whispered in a devilishly seductive voice. Today, I&#x27;ve added something new for you. The Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s latest product, Cenamed Sage Time, can help you better concentrate, eliminate distractions, and significantly enhance your combat effectiveness. Shin Yuan&#x27;s eyelids twitched violently as he listened. What is this female demon up to now? Before leaving, Su Chingu quietly pulled Shin Yuan aside and whispered, &quot;Do you need me to add some more catalyst to the water?&quot; Shin Yuan looked at her eyes, which were full of mischievous glints, smiled confidently, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;No need, Dr. Sue.&quot; The prey has walked into the trap. He was determined to use his own abilities to completely subdue this audacious woman in front of him, fair and square. looking at his confident and doineering eyes. Su Ching Xu nodded in satisfaction, turned around, and walked away with elegant cat-like steps.</p>
<p>She chuckled inwardly. Lung Yu was quite something. Her scheme of using her beauty was incredibly effective. It was a pity she had chosen the wrong opponent. Did you intend to use this method to control Shinuan? It&#x27;s hard to say who will end up being completely taken advantage of.</p>
<p>In the huge medicinal bath, only Shin Yuan and Lu remained. The rising steam instantly created an incredibly ambiguous atmosphere. Lung Yu looked at the man in front of her, took a deep breath, and began to slowly and methodically unbutton her white shirt. One, two. As her shirt slipped down, she walked to the low stool by the bathtub, sat down, crossed one leg, and reached out to grasp her slender ankle.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to take off those deadly, alluring black stockings, Shin Yuan&#x27;s deep horse voice stopped her. Don&#x27;t. Lyu paused in her movements. He nodded obediently. Then, under Shin Yuans gaze, she stood up and stroed forward, displaying her incredibly long legs encased in black stockings.</p>
<p>Step by step, I stepped into the bathtub filled with swirling purple steam. Chapter 95. Taking a different approach, the scent of dragon. Lung, you did as she was told, wearing those deadly alluring black stockings, and stepped into the bathtub. She tried to suppress the strange feeling in her heart, which was pounding uncontrollably.</p>
<p>She is about to experience the secret behind Long Yings rapid improvement and strength. What does this matter when it comes to power to breaking through that damn bottleneck? Lyu took a deep breath and imitating Long Yings actions proactively extended her warm and smooth jade hand. Give me your hand. Her voice remained cold, but at the end of her sentence, there was a hint of barely perceptible tension and anticipation. Shinyuan grinned mischievously and extended his hand.</p>
<p>As their palms touched in the scalding medicinal liquid, Lung Yu immediately closed her eyes and tried to guide the surging vital energy within Shin Yuan&#x27;s body. However, reality gave her a resounding slap in the face. Without L Yings SS level dragon soul battle body as a bridge, her A-level ice element control talent is simply incompatible with the scorching Yuan Chi mixed with the bloodline of the subdragon in Shun Yuan&#x27;s body. The moment the two completely different energies came into contact, they were like ice and fire, violently repelling each other. Sizzle with a soft sound, a sharp needle-like pain shot through her palm, causing her to jerkly pull her hand back as if she had been electrocuted.</p>
<p>No lungs pretty face pald, and her usually cold and sharp eyes were instantly filled with disappointment and discouragement. The newly ignited flame of hope seemed about to be completely extinguished by this bucket of merciless cold water. I don&#x27;t have her talent. Seeing her distraught appearance, Shin Yuan smiled. I&#x27;ve said it before.</p>
<p>She has her broad path. And we have our narrow bridge. He stood up from the bathtub and walked confidently toward Lung Yu, the water parting in front of him. Who told you that you can only cultivate by holding hands? I have another way to give you the pure dragon energy you&#x27;ve always dreamed of. He walked up to Lung Yu, looked down at her, and gave her new instructions.</p>
<p>I sat down on the edge of the bathtub. Although Lung Yu was puzzled, the willingness level, which was already as high as 90%, made her instinctively choose to obey. She shifted her body and sat on the smooth edge of the bathtub. She didn&#x27;t understand what Shun Yuan wanted to do, but she knew that her only hope of breaking through lay with the man in front of her. The next second, Under Lung Yus puzzled and nervous gaze.</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked up at her, his eyes filled with a nightly devotion. Dragon energy is the purest source of life energy in the world. Transmission requires a large area. The moment Lyu heard these words, she understood. What exactly is this man trying to do her usually icy and aloof face suddenly turned bright red.</p>
<p>Shinuan didn&#x27;t give her a chance to refuse. He looked into her wide, watery eyes, which were filled with shame and indignation, and a smug, wicked smile spread across his face. Then he began to create his own unique and entirely new method. Lung Yu&#x27;s body trembled, and her whole body tensed up as if she had been electrocuted. A warm yet doineering energy is continuously flowing into my body.</p>
<p>She could roughly sense that the stagnant vital energy within her body was being cleansed and purified little by little by this powerful life energy. The formidable bottleneck that had plagued her for two whole years suddenly began to loosen again. At this moment, an hour later, Lyu by the pool only wanted the dragon energy that nourishes all things to continue to cleanse her body and help her break through the fifth realm. Shinyuan looked at her, then at himself, a thoughtful expression on his face. That&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>Really interesting. Different training equipment makes a world of difference. Chapter 96. Long Aging is pregnant. Breakthrough to the fourth realm.</p>
<p>Another hour later, when Shin Yuan walked out of the medicinal bath looking radiant, it was already dawn. Long after Shin Yuan left, Lyu managed to gather a sliver of clarity. A faint but pure pale golden dragon aura carrying a scorching and doineering presence was slowly flowing through her harsh meridians. Wherever it passed, the originally rocksolid bottlenecks of her cultivation realm began to loosen with a tingling sensation. She understood.</p>
<p>She understood completely. To extract the purest dragon energy from this man, you don&#x27;t need any SS level talent as a bridge. Meanwhile, Shin Yuan, having finished his appetizers and main course, did not rest immediately. He felt so energetic that he could kill 10 Earth dragons with a single punch. He went straight to the room next door, Long Yings room.</p>
<p>Longing was not asleep. She was wearing a silk night gown, leaning against the headboard, holding a book on military theory in her hand. But her usually cold and sharp Phoenix eyes would occasionally glance towards the door, her gaze hiding a restlessness and resentment that she herself was unaware of. When she saw Shin Yuan pushed the door open and enter, she immediately closed the book, turned her head away, and spoke in a horse and cold voice. I&#x27;m late.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new students foundation was too weak and she was clumsy, so I had to work overtime and tutor her a little longer. Shin Yuan walked to the bedside and sat down, pulling Long a into his arms. He kissed her smooth forehead and said with a mischievous smile, &quot;But don&#x27;t worry, instructor Long, the best lessons are always reserved for you.&quot; As he spoke, he skillfully helped Longing take off her slippers, preparing for their daily ritual. However, Longing was surprised to find that he did not fetch the basin of steaming hot foot bath water as usual. She felt a strange sense of loss.</p>
<p>Is he not going to bully me today? Just as she was lost in thought, Shinuan quickly brought her back to her senses. For the next 3 days, Shinuan lived a life of luxury that even ancient emperors would envy. His time was fully scheduled. In between, he would also comfort Natasha, who had been completely reduced to a personal maid, and use his pure dragon energy to nourish Lin Char and the unborn baby in her womb. The morning of the fourth day, when the first rays of sunlight shone into Lyings room again, Shin Yuan woke up from his dream with a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>At this time, a series of Heavenly System notifications rang in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. The special gene lock of the Dragon Soul battle body was detected in the target Lyings body. The dragon chi nourishing function was automatically activated and began gene optimization. Genetic optimization accounts for 10% 50% and 99%. Genetic optimization complete.</p>
<p>The bloodline purity of the target long ings dragon soul battle body has increased by 15%. Successfully broken through to the fifth realm grandmaster realm. Due to the enhancement of her bloodline, Ly Ying&#x27;s total score has increased by one, currently at 99. An additional reward of 1/5if of her current health and mana has been given. Congratulations, host.</p>
<p>You have successfully brought good fortune to Longing, the holder of an SS level talent. Special quest. The dragon born&#x27;s embrace completed. Ding ding ding. Massive task rewards are being settled.</p>
<p>Boom. A series of system notifications like the most powerful bomb of happiness instantly blanked Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind, leaving only endless ecstasy. It&#x27;s done. It&#x27;s finally done. I finally completely defeated the SS level talent, the god level ironblooded overlord flower.</p>
<p>Personal reward one. One chance for an SS level second stage talent awakening. Use now personal reward two. Obtain the strategic level blueprint dragon blood tempering pool. The blueprint has been automatically saved to system space.</p>
<p>Bonus reward plus 90,000 HP. A clan reward based on 1/5if of the target long Yings maximum HP. 90,000 points ofqi and blood. SS level second stage talent awakening. Shinyuan felt as if the blood in his body was burning.</p>
<p>Having already reached the mid-stage of the third realm marshall master with 50,000 points of chi and blood under the frenzied infusion of these 90,000 points ofqi and blood. It was like a flood breaking through a dam, instantly breaking through one bottleneck after another. Ding. Your chi and blood value has exceeded 90,000. Congratulations, host, on successfully advancing to the peak of the third realm, Marshall Master.</p>
<p>Ding! YourQi and blood value has exceeded 100,000. Congratulations, host, on successfully advancing to the fourth realm, great marshall master. Fourth realm, Grand Marshall Master. In just one night, he jumped two minor realms from the middle stage of the third realm and directly entered the fourth realm of Grand Marshall Master. Moreover, he has a solid foundation, and hisqi and blood are far more abundant than those of a fourth level martial arts master of the same level.</p>
<p>Who would believe such a rocket-like upgrade speed? H seemingly sensing the sudden surge of terrifying blood energy emanating from Shun Yuan, Longing, still asleep, trembled her long eyelashes and let out a soft, dreamlike moan before slowly opening her misty phoenix eyes. Chapter 97. A divine finishing blow. Xiao Jingua questions his existence. The headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, the living quarters at the deepest part of the underground base.</p>
<p>Only a dim bedside lamp was on in the room, casting an ambiguous light. Leun lay languidly on the soft bed. She gave her husband, who had just come out of the bathroom, wearing only a towel around his waist and still dripping wet, a flirtatious glance. Tell me honestly, how long have you been holding this in? Xiao Jingua was drying his wet short hair with a towel when he heard his wife&#x27;s cokeetish complaint. His face flushed, but he refused to admit defeat.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t it because I&#x27;ve been missing you? It&#x27;s been almost a month and I&#x27;ve been either busy with that Shun Yuan kids mess or that neverending pile of problems at the company. Now that we finally have a chance, it&#x27;s just the two of us. So, of course, we&#x27;re going to collect everything we owed you, principle and interest. Despite his boastful words, Ziao Jingo was inwardly apprehensive. Even if someone is a grandmaster of the fifth realm, their energy will not be as good as it used to be when they reach middle age.</p>
<p>Just now, he felt a bit sore in his lower back and knees, and he was feeling weak afterward. Lie Yun felt a warmth in her heart, but little did she know that her husband was feeling guilty. He took the initiative to reach out his fair and slender arms and hook them around Xiaoings neck, his red lips close to his ear. The interest hasn&#x27;t been fully collected yet. Ziao Jingwa froze, inwardly groaning.</p>
<p>My back is killing me. However, at this crucial moment, thump, thump, thump. A rapid, almost frightening knocking suddenly erupted in the silent room without warning. The voice was urgent and heavy, not like a normal report at all, but more like something terrible had happened outside. Ziao Jingga&#x27;s heart skipped a beat, followed by a surge of elation.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re saved just in time. His face instantly contorted with rage, and he yelled at the doorway, &quot;Who is it? What time is it? Is the sky falling down this early in the morning? Outside the door came a young woman&#x27;s voice which had become somewhat shrill due to extreme anxiety and excitement. Reporting to brother Xiao, reporting to Sister Lee. The final confirmation report just came from the medical department. Longing is pregnant.</p>
<p>Boom. This short sentence instantly silenced the room. The two remained in this extremely strange posture, staring at each other with wide eyes. Pregnant. It&#x27;s only been a few days.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Xiaoing was suddenly sat up in bed. He even forgot that he was shirtless. He just subconsciously started counting on his fingers, muttering to himself. His expression was as if he had seen a ghost in broad daylight.</p>
<p>It was as interesting as it could be. Wait, this timing is wrong. From the time that kid completely subdued Longing, that iceberg until now, it&#x27;s been less than 10 days, right? He counted on his fingers, struggling to calculate this math problem that shattered his worldview. This is a guaranteed minimum. When this outrageous number came out of his mouth, he was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Is this guy even human? He subconsciously turned his head and glanced at Le Yun, who was also in shock beside him. Then he looked down at himself. The powerful confidence that belonged to a fifth realm Grandmaster was completely shattered by Shun Yuan&#x27;s terrifying achievements at this moment. He couldn&#x27;t help but mutter to himself, &quot;I, a Grandmaster at the peak of the fifth realm, am not as powerful as this kid at the third realm. This is not scientific.</p>
<p>This is absolutely not scientific. There was a doubt about the worldview in that voice and a deep sense of frustration that any man would understand. Looking at her husband&#x27;s pathetic, lost, and bewildered state, Lean felt both annoyed and amused. She quickly got out of bed, hearing her husband still muttering to himself. She turned around and glanced at him indifferently, then nodded very seriously in an extremely sincere tone.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#x27;s definitely not as good, Xiaoing. According to Dr. sued Shing X&#x27;s long-term observation and data analysis. Shinyuan&#x27;s body had long been transformed into a non-human monster by his mysterious dragon energy. His physical strength, endurance, recovery ability, and especially his sexual desire and ability far exceeded the scope of normal humans.</p>
<p>While tidying her own face, Le Yun, in a tone of stating facts, delivered the most fatal blow to her husband&#x27;s fragile heart. So, it&#x27;s perfectly normal that you can&#x27;t compare to your husband. she added meaningfully. You have to admit for men some things really are a matter of talent. Puff Xiao Jingwa felt as if a red-hot steel knife had been plunged into his heart without any bend.</p>
<p>Being told to your face by your wife that you&#x27;re no good is a million times worse than losing to the enemy on the battlefield. He grumbled as he got out of bed, frantically putting on his pants, still muttering defiantly. Impossible. Absolutely impossible. Back when I was on the battlefield charging in and out seven times, slaughtering those star beasts until they were trembling in fear.</p>
<p>That kid was probably still playing in the mud somewhere. He angrily dressed and followed Le Yun out of the room. His back view seemed to convey a sense of resentment, as if he was saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not convinced, but there&#x27;s nothing I can do.&quot; Chapter 98. The iceberg female CEO of Heavenly God Industries. 10 minutes later, at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters in the highest command center, when the reward panel from Shun Yuan System settlement was shared to the main screen in the command room via encrypted communication, the entire room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>Xiao Jinga, Li Yun, and her husband, and Su Ching Zhu were all drawn to the strategic blueprint of the dragon blood tempering pool, which emitted a faint golden halo. This is Xiao Jingua. A fifth level Grandmaster was so excited that his hands were trembling. He stared at the incredibly complex blueprint covered with countless energy runes and formulas he couldn&#x27;t decipher at all. Is Adam&#x27;s apple bobbing.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t understand it, but he knew the weight of the words strategic level better than anyone else. Su Ching Zhu rushed to the screen, the gold rimmed glasses on her nose reflecting the light of the data stream. She stretched out her slender fingers and quickly operated on the virtual keyboard, and a massive amount of data flowed into her personal terminal. In just a few seconds, for the first time, a solemn expression mixed with shock and fervor appeared on her usually playful and composed intellectual face. &quot;Oh my god!&quot; Su Chingu gasped as she looked at the parameters being analyzed on the screen, and her beautiful eyes behind her glasses flashed with a terrifying light.</p>
<p>The design concept of this drawing is at least 50 years ahead of our time. She turned her head, her voice filled with barely suppressed excitement and shock. It actually intends to guide the Earth vain dragon energy of our planet and combine it with dozens of top level ferocious beast materials containing enormous life energy to build pools that can temper the physical bodies of martial artists in batches and optimize the bloodline of our human race at the genetic level. Once completed, the average physical condition of all low-level martial artists in our umbrella corporation will at least double. Those warriors who are stuck at a bottleneck and unable to make any progress in their lives will have a very high probability of breaking through their shackles.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xus breathing became rapid. This is not a pool at all. This is a super factory that can produce geniuses. These words made Xiao Jingwa and Li Yun gasp for breath. However, Su Ching Xus tone suddenly changed, pouring cold water on their passionate feelings.</p>
<p>But her gaze fell on the long, densely packed list of materials at the bottom of the drawing, and her brows furrowed. The information above is exaggerated. The spinal cord of the nine netherear dragon, the core of the 10,000-year blood coral, and the reverse scale of the void dragon whale are all legendary treasures, priceless, and unavailable for purchase. especially the most crucial core material, the heart&#x27;s blood of the eastern candle dragon. That&#x27;s a cataclysmic star beast at the peak of the eighth realm, which has been slumbering in the depths of the east sea for nearly a thousand years.</p>
<p>Forget about taking its heart&#x27;s blood. Even getting close to its sleeping ground would result in being crushed to death by the dragons might it unconsciously emits. This news instantly plunged Xiao Jingua and Li Yun, who had just been overjoyed, into despair. a star beast at the peak of the eighth realm. That was a terrifying being who could wipe half an empire off the map single-handedly.</p>
<p>Report the materials issued to the company immediately. Ziao Jingua made a decisive decision. Even if it really came down to slaying a dragon, it would have to be him personally who devised the plan. Our umbrella corporation doesn&#x27;t have that capability. Even if the material problem is solved, construction will be an enormous challenge.</p>
<p>Such Ching Zhu shook her head again, pointing to the energy circuits on the blueprints that were countless times finer than a hair, her face full of distress. The machining precision required by the blueprints is at the nanometer level. Furthermore, ultra high power energy sources and anti-gravity construction equipment are needed to assist in the construction. Our company&#x27;s existing equipment simply does not meet the standards. If we force construction, the success rate will be less than 10%.</p>
<p>Just as the atmosphere reached another impass, Su Ching Xu pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and a glint of light flashed in her intelligent eyes. However, I do have someone in mind. The Imperial Capital, Celestial Industries, possesses the most advanced precision manufacturing technology and cuttingedge energy technology in the entire empire. If we can get that female CEO to personally take charge, we can at least increase the success rate to over 70%, if not 100%. and the construction period can be shortened by at least 2/3.</p>
<p>Heavenly God industries. Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua exchanged a glance and immediately understood what Su Ching Zhu meant. Zhia would chuckled. Money isn&#x27;t the problem. The problem is they won&#x27;t take the order.</p>
<p>I heard that female CEO is arrogant and has a temper colder than an iceberg. She won&#x27;t even bother to glance at ordinary orders. So, he made the final decision. Ching Xu, you&#x27;re in charge of making the contact. Li Yun and I on behalf of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters will negotiate a multi-billion dollar deal with her.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll first arrange for her to come to Dong Hai for a face-to-face meeting. As the youngest tenur professor at Beijing Marshall University, Su Chingus network of connections far exceeds expectations. She immediately obtained the private contact number of the female president of Tianin Industry through her mentor, the equally mysterious female principal of the Imperial Capital Martial Arts University, whose strength had reached the eighth realm. The communication was quickly established, and the command room fell silent as everyone held their breath. Lie Yun cleared her throat, preparing to speak.</p>
<p>A cold, emotionless female voice, seemingly capable of freezing one&#x27;s soul, came through the communicator. Tian Shin Industry, Mu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu Wuan Bing. Before Le Yun could even speak, she already knew what the purpose of their visit was. The deal with the Umbrella Corporation is negotiable, but I only talked to people who can make decisions, and I don&#x27;t like wasting time. Beep.</p>
<p>The call was abruptly ended. The command center was deathly silent. Chapter 99 SS rank talent awakening. Undying flame soul. Shinuan opened the system panel and stared intently at the second system reward, which was also the reward he was most looking forward to, an SS level random talent awakening card.</p>
<p>This thing is his ultimate trump card, the one that can get him off the frank loser label system. Use SS level random talent awakening card. In his mind, Shinuan gave the command in a tone full of ritual. Ding. It has been detected that the dragon energy within the host&#x27;s body is sufficiently abundant and the foundation is solid, meeting the conditions for direct awakening.</p>
<p>This awakening will not require the assistance of an external magic array and will be completed directly within the host&#x27;s body. Please prepare accordingly. SS level talent random awakening begin. The moment the words fell, Shin Yuan felt as if a star was being born deep within his Danteon. A terrifying energy so hot it seemed to burn away the soul and so doineering it could tear the sky apart suddenly erupted in his dantion.</p>
<p>Shinyuan let out a suppressed groan. His whole body uncontrollably collapsing cross-legged on the ground. His muscles tensed instantly. Veins bulged on his forehead and large beads of sweat slid down his forehead like raindrops. It&#x27;s  hot.</p>
<p>He felt as if he were a piece of ordinary iron thrown into a steel furnace being thoroughly and destructively forged and reshaped from the inside out from his soul to his body by an indescribable terrifying flame originating from the very source of life. His dantion transformed into a super volcano about to erupt. That terrifying crimson gold energy was swirling, compressing, and condensing wildly within his dantion. Two minutes later, when the scorching heat that had almost burned him to ashes receded like the tide, all the radiance converged and collapsed wildly towards the very center of his dantion. Finally, it reached his Danteon above that ocean of boundless blood and golden dragon energy.</p>
<p>There was an extra slowly rotating crimson flame like a miniature sun radiating eternal light and heat. At the same time, the system notifications sounded in his mind. Ding! Congratulations, host. Your second talent awakening has been successful. Obtained SS level talent, undying flame soul talent effect.</p>
<p>The host&#x27;s body is born with the flame soulf fire seed, which can be freely controlled as a special life flame. This flame not only possesses terrifying destructive power capable of burning mountains and boiling seas, but it can also use life force as fuel to refine vital energy, purify blood vessels, and even burn away the impurities of all things in the world. Undying flame soul. Shinuan opened his eyes. He could clearly feel the terrifying power within him that seemed capable of burning everything and dominating life and death.</p>
<p>He was so excited that his whole body was trembling slightly. Is this the power of an SS level talent? He leaped up from the ground and threw a punch at the empty space in the room. He wanted to test just how powerful his newly acquired divine skill really was. Call. A ball of crimson gold flame, no bigger than a fist, but radiating terrifying heat, shot out from his fist like a cannonball.</p>
<p>The flames were incredibly fast. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t even see its trajectory before the flame landed precisely on beside the bed on Long Yings black military boots that she had just taken off, still carrying a faint fragrance and the warmth of her owner&#x27;s body. Laugh dash. A soft sound. Those special military boots made of the leather of the top tier third tier star beast, the Shadow Wolf, were incredibly tough and could withstand the bombardment of ordinary artillery shells.</p>
<p>But they couldn&#x27;t even last a second. Under the gaze of Shun Yuans eyes, which widened instantly, filled with a sense of unease and disbelief. Those precious shoes that he had just taken off last night instantly turned into a clump of black ash, leaving only a faint smell of burnt leather in the air. Shinuan, he was dumbfounded. He looked at the lone clump of ashes on the ground, then at his own fist, his mind blank.</p>
<p>This is outrageous. Longing had just regained a little strength. She looked exhausted yet filled with the joy and satisfaction of becoming a new mother. Feeling the wonderful changes in her body brought about by good fortune. As a result, she witnessed a scene that left her completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>She looked at the familiar ashes of her beloved combat boots on the ground, then glanced at Shin Yuan next to her, who was scratching his head with an innocent look on his face as if nothing had happened. Ly Yings usually cold and pretty face turned angry after a brief moment of surprise. A huge wave of shame and indignation, feeling offended and rejected, erupted like a volcano, shattering the tenderness she had just built up as a young woman. Shinuan, she jumped off the bed, pointing at the clump of ash on the ground, her cold phoenix eyes almost spit fire. What do you mean? Burn my shoes.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re disgusted with me. Looking at her adorable, flustered appearance, Shin Yuan felt a chill run down his spine, but he refused to admit defeat verbally. He scratched his head and began to talk nonsense in a serious tone. Ahe him instructor long. You&#x27;ve misunderstood.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just worried about you. Think about it. You wear this thing every day. It&#x27;s stuffy and doesn&#x27;t breathe. Your feet, which used to smell so nice, are starting to smell bad.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he pretended to sniff it, then waved his hand dismissively. See, I&#x27;m helping you solve the problem at its root. You won&#x27;t have to wash everyday anymore. How convenient. This bizarre and utterly chased argument nearly gave Long Ing a heart attack.</p>
<p>Looking at Shun Yuan&#x27;s innocent expression that said, &quot;I&#x27;m doing this all for your own good.&quot; She trembled with anger, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. So, you&#x27;re disgusted? Longing was filled with shame and indignation. She lifted her smooth, flawless foot and without thinking, &quot;Bang.&quot; Shinyuan stumbled from her kick. Release. Shinyuan then let go of her hand, pretended to wipe himself on his pants, and said with a disgusted look on his face, &quot;Okay, okay, from now on, you&#x27;ll wash yourself clean before I pamper you.&quot; After saying that, he turned around and gave her an extremely smug and wicked smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, instructor Long. Then I&#x27;ll go wash Lung Yus black stockings from now on. Hers definitely smells better than yours.&quot; Longing completely broke down. Shiny Yuan, you bastard. She grabbed the pillow next to her and threw it at Shun Yuans smug face.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan slipped out of the room in an instant. Chapter 100. The countess&#x27;s special treatment. Shun Yuans special care. Long Yings graduation ceremony was even grander than Shin Yuan had imagined.</p>
<p>Not only were the system rewards so generous that he broke through on the spot, but Longing himself also fell into a deep sleep and self- consolidation for 12 hours due to the optimization of his bloodline and the breakthrough to the fifth realm. This gave Shin Yuan a rare vacation. As for Lin Shur and Natasha, their bellies grew bigger everyday. For the sake of the baby&#x27;s health, Su Chingu strictly forbade him from having any more nighttime contact. For a moment, Shinuan actually felt a bit idol.</p>
<p>The blood and chi within his body, which had become unusually active and even somewhat restless due to the second awakening of the undying flame soul, had nowhere to be released, making him feel itchy all over. Since I&#x27;m just idling around anyway, why not? An idea quietly surfaced in his mind. He remembered the noble and aloof countest who was imprisoned in the deepest part of the underground wearing ripped black stockings, visiting prisoners of war, offering humanitarian care, and incidentally making progress. That&#x27;s perfectly reasonable, isn&#x27;t it? Shinuan found himself a plausible reason, then stroed confidently toward the highest level solitary confinement cell, whistling as he did so. At the entrance to the solitary confinement cell, two tall, fully armed female special forces fighters stood at attention upon seeing Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Their eyes filled with an indescribable sense of awe and sympathy. They had heard that this man was the company hero who single-handedly dragged the incomparably beautiful countest of the Federation until reinforcements arrived. As for the specifics of how the delay was handled, several versions have been circulating within the company&#x27;s headquarters. Each one so scandalous it makes one blush. You&#x27;ve worked hard.</p>
<p>Shinyuan smiled at the two of them and then gestured for them to open the door. The heavy alloy door slid open silently. Shinuan pushed open the door and entered, expecting to see a female prisoner who had been tortured beyond recognition, or at least whose face was filled with despair. The scene before him, however, left him both amused and exasperated. The confined room was brightly lit and at a comfortable temperature.</p>
<p>Akasha wasn&#x27;t tied to the bed. Instead, she lay on her side on the cold metal bed, the collar of her plain white prison uniform undone by two buttons. She casually lifted the hem of her prison uniform up to her thighs, revealing her plump, straight, and incredibly beautiful legs crossed inexposed to the air without any cover. Even more outrageous, the virtual screen in front of her wasn&#x27;t playing any news or documentary at all. Instead, it&#x27;s a foreign drama with shockingly explicit content and visuals that could be described as R-rated titled shameless.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still the uncut version. She watched with great interest, occasionally picking up a glass of red wine from the table next to her and taking an elegant sip as if this were not a heavily guarded company cell, but her private vacation estate overlooking the entire federal capital at night. When Shun Yuan entered, Akasha merely glanced at him lazily with her deep violet eyes. her red lips curving into a playful ark. She lazily patted the fairly spacious empty space next to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Young man, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. Do you want to accompany me to appreciate this crude yet real ugliness of human nature? Or perhaps she extended her scarlet tongue and gently licked her full lips, her eyes growing increasingly fiery and bold. Want to personally teach me some more exciting ways to play than in the show?&quot; Shiny Yuan looked at her defiant attitude, even daring to provoke him, and could only sneer inwardly. This woman really won&#x27;t shed a tear until she sees the coffin. Even though he&#x27;s a prisoner, he still thinks he can use his stunning body to control the situation, seduce her into having a baby, and steal her jeans.</p>
<p>The mental stimulation I gave her last time wasn&#x27;t enough. Today, I have to add some more shock value to her story. Shinyuan didn&#x27;t speak, but simply took long strides and walked step by step to the bedside. He ignored Akasha&#x27;s expectant and playful gaze and did not pounce on her as she had anticipated. Instead, under her slightly surprised gaze, he suddenly bent down, opened his arms, put one hand under her soft waist, and the other under her straight knees, and in a perfect princess carry, he easily held her voluuptuous and alluring body in his arms.</p>
<p>Um, the sudden feeling of weightlessness made Akasha gasp in surprise, and her hands instinctively wrapped around Shan Yuans neck. Young master, are you impatient? Akasha quickly calmed down. However, Shin Yuan ignored her flirting. You. A genuine look of shame, anger, and rage flashed across Akasha&#x27;s pretty face.</p>
<p>His other hand caressed her noble and beautiful face. Rough fingertips carrying a hint of scalding heat slid from her smooth forehead down to her high straight nose. Akasha&#x27;s unique aristocratic scent, a blend of rose and blood, was like the most potent gene-enhancing drug, constantly stimulating the genes within him. But he forcefully suppressed that impulse. He didn&#x27;t do anything further.</p>
<p>He simply pinched her perfectly sculpted chin, a work of art, and lowered his head. Just as their lips were about to touch, Shin Yuan changed his approach and whispered in her ear, &quot;Your excellency, you acted very well. Unfortunately, in my eyes, all your pride and allure are ridiculously cheap. Akasha&#x27;s beautiful violet eyes widened instantly. All pretense was ripped to shreds at this moment.</p>
<p>The next second, h time seemed to stretch out infinitely at this moment. Ding. A major weakness has been detected in the target Akasha Dracula&#x27;s mental defenses. Conquest progress plus 10%. Current total progress 50%.</p>
<p>Hearing the system notification in his mind, Shin Yuan thought to himself. Trying to play mind games with me? You&#x27;re still too green. Chapter 101. The countest suffers second humiliation. Katarina.</p>
<p>Shinuan did not leave immediately. Instead, he bent down, leaned close to her ear, and whispered something almost cruel. Each word striking deep into her soul. Akasha Dracula, a high-ranking countest in the Free Federation, is the goddess coveted by countless powerful individuals. His voice carried a hint of mocking laughter.</p>
<p>Look at yourself now. In order to get my jeans, you&#x27;ve even given up your last bit of dignity and pride. So eager to have a child with a prisoner? He pinched her delicate chin, forcing her to look at him, the curve of his lips growing increasingly cold. You are truly despicable now. After saying that, Shinuan gave her an extremely irritating victorious smile.</p>
<p>He turned and left. Bang. The door to the solitary confinement cell was slammed shut. Akasha despicable. He actually called her vulgar.</p>
<p>The word exploded in her mind like the most vicious curse, shattering all her pretense and pride. She, the most dazzling jewel of the Rothschild family, the future queen, was actually described by a man with such words. Not again. It&#x27;s that damned mental humiliation of treating her like a monkey again. A dash.</p>
<p>Inside the confinement room, the countess&#x27;s scream filled with boundless anger and humiliation echoed once more. She sat up abruptly, grabbed a glass of top quality red wine worth millions from the table next to her, and smashed it against the tightly closed door. Bang! The crystal glass shattered against the hard alloy door. The scarlet wine slowly flowed down the door panel like streaks of humiliating tears of blood. Akasha was breathing heavily, her breathtaking curves heaving violently with rage.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot; She covered her face, her nails almost digging into her flesh. She couldn&#x27;t understand whether it was the deep-seated desire for powerful genes within her blood that had overcome her reason, or has this man already used such a humiliating method to leave an indelible mark on his soul. She didn&#x27;t realize that this feeling of losing control would lead her to compromise with this man for the second time, allowing him to humiliate her so severely. Ding. Target Akasha has experienced extreme mental humiliation and stimulation.</p>
<p>Her submission value has increased by 10%. Current progress 60%. At the same time, in the distant Free Federation, nestled deep in the Alps, lies an ancient and mysterious castle filled with medieval Gothic style. The banquet hall is luxurious and spacious, large enough to accommodate hundreds of people dancing at the same time. A stunningly beautiful woman dressed in a magnificent vintage style court dress with a figure even more voluuptuous and mature than Akashas sat elegantly on the throne made of a single piece of gold symbolizing the highest power of the family.</p>
<p>Her dazzling golden curls were tied up high with a crown studded with diamonds and rubies. That face which bore a striking resemblance to Akasha but possessed an added air of elegance and majesty honed by time was adorned only with light makeup. Yet it remained breathtakingly beautiful. She is Akasha&#x27;s aunt and also her greatest political enemy, now the acting head of the Rothschild family, Katarina von Rothschild. At this moment, she was looking with great interest at the S-level encrypted intelligence that had just been transmitted back from the Dragon Sai Empire.</p>
<p>She elegantly crossed her legs, revealing a glimpse of her plump, jade-like legs encased in black lace stockings through the slit of her long court dress. Not only her appearance, but even her fashion sense was exactly the same as her nieces. When she saw her arrogant niece suffer a crushing defeat in Dongghai City, being suppressed on the spot by the eighth realm marshall emperor of the Lang Sha Empire and becoming a prisoner. A hint of shot and Freuda flickered in her blue eyes, which always carried a touch of authority and indifference. Cluck, cluck.</p>
<p>She let out a series of silvery joyful laughs. My dear niece, you really are useless. She managed to get herself involved in something as trivial as arresting a man. But that&#x27;s fine. It saves me the trouble of doing it myself.</p>
<p>She casually tossed the intelligence report onto the table, then picked up a cup of bloody Mary made with the freshest blood of a young maid, handed to her by a nearby maid, and elegantly took a sip. Relay my orders. Her voice was cold and unquestionable. Convene a meeting of the family elders immediately. Take for example Akasha&#x27;s capture during a secret mission in Lomshia.</p>
<p>I, Katarina, will temporarily assume all power over her blood rose intelligence department. In addition, in my personal capacity, I am sending a strongly worded letter of protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Langshi Empire. Tell them that if they dare to lay a finger on my niece, the Rothschild family will spare no effort to make them pay the most painful price. She made strong protests, but her blue eyes were full of hypocritical calculations. She was hoping that the Umbrella Corporation would torture Akasha beyond recognition.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s best if they never come back. This way, she can more firmly hold on to her position as acting clan leader. Only then can the Queen&#x27;s throne, which symbolizes the highest power in the family, truly belong to her. Chapter 10 O2. The Iceberg CEO&#x27;s new mission.</p>
<p>humming a little tune, Shin Yuan was in a good mood as he prepared to return to his number one fortress to enjoy the gentle embrace of Lin Churin and Natasha. However, as soon as he reached the corner of the corridor, he was blocked by three figures. It was Li Yun, Zhiao Jingwa, and Suing Zhu. The three of them had clearly come here specifically to wait for him. Ziao Jingwa had his arms crossed.</p>
<p>Li Yun was leaning against the wall, and Su Ching Zhu was looking down at her tablet. Not bad, kid. As soon as Xiao Jingwa came up, he punched him hard in the chest, his face full of praise. You&#x27;re a real talent, kid. That faint indifference was a brilliant move.</p>
<p>That federal woman is probably stomping her feet in anger right now, isn&#x27;t she? Lean also wore a playful expression, looking Shin Yuan up and down, her eyes gleaming with gossip. Confess now. What exactly did you do in there? I heard it all clearly. It was absolutely agonizing. Anyone who didn&#x27;t know better would think you were inflicting some kind of torture.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Shin Yuan blushed, quickly coughed twice, and adopted a mysterious and inscrable demeanor. Ahem tactics. These are all tactics not to be discussed with outsiders. We were just having a friendly exchange of ideas. All right.</p>
<p>All right. Stop joking around here. Suing Xu pushed up her gold rimmed glasses, interrupting their banter, and a rare seriousness appeared on her face. She handed a tablet computer to Shun Yuan, which displayed a mission briefing with the highest level of encryption. Shin Yuan, the company has just given us the latest instructions.</p>
<p>Lean&#x27;s expression also turns serious. 3 days later, you will be acting as our umbrella company&#x27;s special technical adviser, conducting a business negotiation with Mu Wan Bing, the female president of Ton Shin Industry from the capital. What the heck? Not again. Shinyuan was completely dumbfounded. He felt his head buzz and he almost crashed on the spot.</p>
<p>He subconsciously started counting on his fingers, muttering to himself, his face contorted in a grimace. No, sisterly brother Xiao, isn&#x27;t this arrangement a bit too inhumane? I&#x27;m already exhausted. And now this icy female seo surnamed Mu has appeared. Even if I were made of iron, I couldn&#x27;t withstand this kind of abuse. My kidneys have their limits, too.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll protest. Hearing Shun Yuans complaints, which were full of Versail implications, the expressions of Li Yun, Ziao Jingwa, and Su Ching Zhu present, all became extremely strange. Xiaoings lips twitched wildly. Cough, cough. Ziaoinwa coughed lightly.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t need to emphasize the importance of the dragon blood tempering pool again. Do I? Suing Xu chimed in, her expression incredibly serious. Its construction would have been impossible without that woman. Celestial Industries possesses the most advanced civilian technology in the entire empire. In particular, their unique nanocale photoiththography, precision manufacturing technology, and anti-gravity levitation engineering technology are beyond the reach of our company.</p>
<p>Only if she nods in approval can this blueprint in our hands become a reality. Therefore, this negotiation must succeed. Failure is not an option. Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on yourself. Seeing Shun Yuan&#x27;s stressed expression, Li Yun walked over, patted him on the shoulder, and encouraged him with a smile.</p>
<p>Just consider it a change of pace. Isn&#x27;t he just an aloof CEO? I&#x27;ve already taken down an SS-class female warrior. Why would I be afraid of someone like you who just plays with technology? Rest assured, Shin Yuan gritted his teeth, patted his chest, and said with righteous indignation, he&#x27;s just an aloof CEO. Mission accomplished. I&#x27;ll make her cry and beg me to cooperate with her.</p>
<p>Just as Shin Yuan made his vow and prepared to go back and study the information on this new prey, Such Ching Zu suddenly called out to him. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and behind the lenses, her beautiful eyes shown with an almost fanatical light of scientific inquiry. You&#x27;d better come to me first before you go see your new target. She licked her full red lips, her voice carrying a kind of excitement that sent chills down Shun Yuan spine. My medicinal bath and my latest super soldier serum are ready for their final clinical trials.</p>
<p>It will give you more energy to face all the challenges ahead. Chapter 103. The desire for black stockings. The scientist&#x27;s invitation. Shinuan naturally couldn&#x27;t refuse Su Chingus invitation.</p>
<p>Lyings SS level dragon soul battle Body is no joke. Once unleashed, its passion can melt, even steal. If it weren&#x27;t for my special physical condition, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to hold on much longer. Now that he has Su Ching Xu, a top-notch logistics provider, who is willing to provide him with supplies for free, he is naturally happy to accept it. That evening, Shinuan arrived at Su Ching Xus private laboratory, which was filled with futuristic technology as promised.</p>
<p>As soon as you push open that heavy alloy door, a sophisticated scent mixed with disinfectant and high-end perfume hits you. The laboratory was brightly lit and various high precision instruments that Shun Yuan couldn&#x27;t understand were operating silently, flashing with a ghostly blue light. Such Ching Zu was standing with her back to him in front of a huge holographic screen, still wearing that spotless white coat, her long shapely legs encased in black stockings and her signature red high heels. She seemed to be completely absorbed in analyzing some data and didn&#x27;t even notice Shin Yuan coming in. Shinyuan tiptoed up behind her silently like a cat about to steal some fish.</p>
<p>He opened his arms, ready to give her a surprise hug from behind. However, as soon as he raised his hand, he caught a glimpse of an unexpected figure in the semi-open medicine bathroom next door. It&#x27;s a cold moon. She was already waiting there. Shinuan turned his gaze toward the medicine bath house.</p>
<p>Unlike three days ago, Lyu was not wearing that sexy bodycon miniskirt. She changed into a more conservative yet more figure- hugging black yoga outfit. The tot fabric perfectly accentuated her amazing waist to hip ratio. From her waist to her per buttocks and then to her long straight legs, the lines were so smooth that there wasn&#x27;t a single bit of excess fat, exuding strength and beauty. He stood barefoot on the cold floor.</p>
<p>Those jade-like feet were fair and slender. When she noticed Shinuan&#x27;s gaze, she put her leg down and turned around. That pretty face, which was always aloof, remained expressionless. But when she looked at Shun Yuan, her cold and sharp eyes were filled with an extreme desire for power. You&#x27;ve arrived.</p>
<p>Just as Shun Yuan was about to step into the medicinal bath house to answer the questions of the eager female student, he was about to begin. Cough, cough. A soft cough, however, sounded inappropriately behind him. It&#x27;s Suching Zu. She had turned around at some point and was now leaning against the control panel, holding her magnificent pair of human nuclear weapons, looking at him with a half smile.</p>
<p>Our Mr. Shen seems to be quite popular. Her voice carried a hint of playfulness and teasing. There&#x27;s a new student here, eagerly awaiting your feeding. Her gaze drifted to Lung Yu in the medicinal bath house.</p>
<p>And here I am. I also have freshlymade steaming hot super soldier serum waiting for you to taste it. She shook the syringe in her hand, which was filled with a pale golden liquid and was thicker than Shun Yuans finger. You can choose for yourself. Should we satisfy the students thirst for knowledge first or supplement our own knowledge first? This is another deadly question.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt like his head was about to explode. He glanced at the long-legged, mature woman in the medicinal bath, who had already struck a pose and was looking at him with expectant eyes. He glanced again at the person next to him. The G-class human nuclear weapons scientist with his arms crossed and a sly look on his face that said, &quot;Let&#x27;s see how you chose this.&quot; A strong sense of blissful unease welled up in his heart. In the past, he would have chosen to have it all without even thinking.</p>
<p>But today, he was surprisingly calm. But his real purpose in coming here tonight was not to cultivate with L Yu. It was to win over Su Ching Xu. It was because of her top-of-the-line domestically produced body that he had long coveted and dreamed of studying. A crazy idea quickly took shape in his mind.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan had a new plan in mind. They quickly shifted their gaze from L Yu and finally settled on Su Chingus back, which was wrapped in a white coat, but still appeared plump and mature. That was his real main course tonight. Su Chingu seemed to have eyes in the back of her head. She turned around and met Shun Yuans burning gaze, which seemed to want to devour her alive.</p>
<p>She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, a victorious smile playing on her lips, a smile that said, &quot;You finally couldn&#x27;t hold back anymore.&quot; Then she silently extended an invitation to Shin Yuan with her eyes. If you have the guts, come over here yourself. Shiny Yuan understands. He threw a sentence directly at L Yu, who was looking bewildered and confused from the entrance of the medicinal bath house. That concludes today&#x27;s training.</p>
<p>I have something urgent to discuss with Dr. Su privately. After saying that, ignoring Lung Yus instantly disappointed and unwilling look, he stroed forward with firm steps toward the rail hunter who was embracing him. Lung Yu watched as he walked away without a backward glance toward another woman. Why? She had clearly abandoned all her reserve and pride, even resorting to this method to attract.</p>
<p>Why did he still choose someone else? Is my charm really inferior to that of a scientist who only knows how to play with bottles and jars? Meanwhile, Su Ching Xu watched the man walking towards her step by step, his eyes burning with a fierce flame. Behind her glasses, her beautiful eyes shown with the fervor of a scientist discovering a new continent and a hint of the secret expectation that a woman has when she is being pursued. She didn&#x27;t care how many women this man had. She didn&#x27;t care where she ranked in his heart. All she cared about was that tonight she would personally uncover the man&#x27;s biggest and most alluring secret.</p>
<p>Chapter 104. dedication to science. Top tier domestic production. 10 minutes later, Ensu Ching Zus private lounge. The coldness and seriousness of the laboratory are gone, replaced by a warm and ambiguous feminine atmosphere.</p>
<p>A faint orchid-like fragrance filled the air. Su Chingu stood with her back to Shin Yuan in front of a huge floor toseeiling window, gazing at the bustling city shrouded in night outside. She had taken off her signature white lab coat and put on a burgundy silk night gown. The robe was as thin as a cicada&#x27;s wing, so slippery it could slide off her fingertips. It swayed gently as she raised her hand to gather her hair, clinging to her body as if it were an extension of her skin.</p>
<p>The G-class human nuclear weapon was accentuated by the contrast, with the plump, soft flesh of her waist and abdomen undulating slightly with her movements, and her peach-like, perky, and rounded hips were not concealed at all. Every inch of her curves exuding the soft charm of a voluuptuous woman. Long legs encased in pure black stockings gently crossed, gleaming delicately under the light. Their allure striking the heart. Looking at her perfect back view, which could drive any man crazy, Shin Yuan felt his breathing become heavy.</p>
<p>He walked silently up behind her. His cheek pressed against her smooth, silky night gown and the warm skin beneath it. He took a deep breath, buried his face in her hair, which smelled faintly of shampoo, and sighed contentedly. &quot;Dr. Sue, your flavor fascinates me more than any medicine you&#x27;ve concocted.&quot; &quot;Um!&quot; startled by the sudden embrace, Su Chingus body stiffened slightly, and she let out a soft moan.</p>
<p>But in just a moment, she relaxed. She didn&#x27;t struggle, nor did she turn around. She simply let that man, like a greedy beast, recklessly savor the unique, alluring aura of a mature and intellectual woman emanating from her. After a long while, she slowly turned around. That stunningly beautiful face, which always carried a hint of intellect and coldness, was now tinged with a captivating blush.</p>
<p>Her beautiful eyes, hidden behind her gold- rimmed glasses, held a hint of mockery and a touch of amusement as she looked at the man before her, who was already somewhat unable to control himself. Oh, our Mr. Shan can&#x27;t wait any longer. Longing just graduated and hasn&#x27;t recovered yet. Lung Yu is still in the medicine bath house, eagerly waiting for you to feed her, and you&#x27;ve come here.</p>
<p>What are you dissatisfied with the two of them? Faced with her teasing, which was full of provocation, Shinuan did not feel embarrassed at all. Instead, he pinched her chin and revealed an extremely wicked smile. There&#x27;s nothing we can do about it. It&#x27;s the top-of-the-line domestic model. I&#x27;ve been craving you for a long time.</p>
<p>He lowered his head, his hot breath brushing against Su Ching Xus sensitive earlobe, and every second counts. Now it&#x27;s your turn to sacrifice yourself for science and for the Umbrella Corporation. Dedication. Such Ching Xu stretched out her slender, fair finger, painted with bright red nail polish, and gently touched Shun Yuans firm chest, giggling. Sure, but aren&#x27;t you afraid that I&#x27;ll do what I did last time and bring out another 100% concentration of dragon&#x27;s blood syringe so you can sacrifice yourself for science this time? Haha.</p>
<p>Shinyuan let out a hearty laugh. The woman in front of me may talk a big game, but her body has already betrayed her reason. Her rapid heartbeat and slightly trembling body had already given her away. He picked Su Chingu up from the ground and carried her to the center of the room to the soft, comfortable double bed that could comfortably accommodate several people rolling around on. Just as Shin Yuan was about to pounce, Su Chingu suddenly reached out a hand and precisely pressed down on his wrist, which was about to commit the crime, rendering him unable to move, etc.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xus gaze regained some of the calmness and scrutiny of a scientist. She pushed up the exquisite gold- rimmed glasses on her nose and her beautiful eyes behind the lenses looked directly at Shin Yuan. I&#x27;m very curious. By having the pure and innocent school beauty Lin Sharing graduate, you have obtained the formula for a gene potential enhancement potion. By helping Natasha graduate, you&#x27;ve obtained health enhancement potions for warriors of ranks 1 through 5.</p>
<p>Even Lyings iceberg was melted by you in exchange for the blueprints for the dragon blood tempering pool, which is enough to change the strategic landscape. She licked her full red lips, her voice low and deadly allure. So, what will you get if you have me? Shinyuan smiled. This woman, even at this point, is still using a scientist&#x27;s mindset to assess her own worth. Looking into her beautiful eyes, which always shone with rationality and wisdom, he projected the reward that could drive her completely mad onto her face.</p>
<p>Using his mental power at the same time, his humanoid scanner talent was automatically activated, projecting Su Chingu&#x27;s data panel to the side without reservation. Target: Su Chingu. Appearance rating 97, intellectual and beautiful. Body rating 99, human nuclear weapon. Body details: Thunderous rank G, peach rank S.</p>
<p>Overall rating 98, god tier. Su Ching Xus gaze was first drawn to the golden reward panel, but soon her eyes were fixed on her own data, which was accurate to the extreme. G-class lays 99 point figure. She paused for a few seconds. As the Empire&#x27;s top human scientist, she has a more precise understanding of her own body data than anyone else.</p>
<p>The data on the panel in front of her was exactly the same as her own understanding. This man&#x27;s talent is amazing. Before she could recover from the shock, her gaze was completely captured by the golden reward. Personal reward. Random Srank bloodline awakening.</p>
<p>Personal reward. Future underlings who live on the same territory as the host and feel a sense of belonging to that territory will have their genetic potential development cap permanently increased by 5%. Territory is bound and cannot be changed at will. The playful and composed look on Su Ching Xus face froze completely upon seeing the two rewards. S-rank bloodline genetic potential increased by 5%.</p>
<p>Her desire to explore Shin Yuan. This man and the mysterious, unreasonable, and incredibly lucky talent behind him reached an unprecedented peak at this moment. Ding. The research interest value of target Su Chinhu has reached 100%. Congratulations, host.</p>
<p>Special mission. Sparks of scientific research completed. Good. Su Ching Xus breathing became extremely rapid, and her beautiful eyes, which had previously shown with rationality, erupted with a terrifying fervor. She could no longer maintain her scientists composure and rationality.</p>
<p>His voice trembled slightly with extreme excitement. I do for science. I am willing to give everything. Now, immediately, right now, let me thoroughly examine just how many secrets secrets that could drive the entire world mad are hidden within your FFF level talent body. Before he could finish speaking, she suddenly struck the still bewildered Shinuan.</p>
<p>The situation has reversed. Her eyes filled with fervor and a thirst for exploration were fixed on Shun Yuan. Then, with incredible speed, she began to untie the belt of her silk night gown. The first step is to collect the most original and purest dragon energy samples. The second step is to observe the specific changes in the energy activity of the dragon energy when the host is in a state of extreme excitement.</p>
<p>Step three. Chapter 105. A crazy experiment. Jurang strength. What is this woman crazy? Shinuan was completely bewildered by Su Ching Zus sudden takeover.</p>
<p>He felt that he wasn&#x27;t there to conquer a goddess, but rather to be dissected like a lab rat by a crazy female scientist. Such quickly and easily removed the cumbersome silk night gown from her body. Then that body hailed as the pinnacle of domestic production, a human nuclear weapon, extremely breathtaking and exquisitly voluuptuous. What&#x27;s even more shocking is that she was wearing a carefully prepared, visually striking black lace lingerie set under her bathrobe along with matching garter stockings, a pristine white lab coat paired with decadent black stockings, intellectual gold rimmed glasses. Shiny Yuan&#x27;s breath caught in his throat for a moment.</p>
<p>He felt the blood in his body boil completely at that moment. However, Suing Ju didn&#x27;t give him any time to appreciate or savor the moment. She adopted a queen-like aggressive stance. She leaned down. Her stunningly beautiful and intelligent face close to his ear.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t move. Let me see. Her voice carried a hint of a scientist&#x27;s composure and a hint of a woman&#x27;s barely suppressed excitement. Your heart rate is accelerating, reaching 120 beats per minute. Your body temperature is rising at least 2° higher than normal.</p>
<p>Based on my S-level talent gene insight, I can see that the dragon energy within you becomes incredibly active when you are excited and even produces some strange energy mutations that I have never seen before. As she spoke, she extended her slender fair hand painted with bright red nail polish and began to touch his body. Every movement and every touch of hers was like the most precise scalpel, meticulously dissecting every inch of Shun Yuan&#x27;s jeans. At the same time, her beautiful eyes hidden behind her gold- rimmed glasses shown with an increasingly bright light. And she muttered to herself, &quot;This is so interesting.</p>
<p>It turns out that lust is the best catalyst for the power of your bloodline. When your desires reach their peak, the dragon energy within you will resonate with your spiritual power in a peculiar way, unleashing a terrifying energy activity far exceeding normal levels. if I could extract this energy and then utilize it. Her words made Shun Yuan feel like he had been completely turned into an experimental subject. This woman is still thinking about writing her lab report at a time like this.</p>
<p>At this moment, a man&#x27;s dignity was severely challenged. That&#x27;s enough. Shinuan suddenly reached out and grabbed Su Ching Xus slender hand, which was still taking a sample from his chest. The force was so strong that Su Ching Xus eyebrows furrowed. Dr.</p>
<p>Su, are you sure you&#x27;ve made a mistake? He stared into her eyes, which shown with fervor, and said, word by word, &quot;I&#x27;m not here to help you finish some  lab report, a brilliant counterattack.&quot; Shin yuan looked at the woman who had just dared to treat him like a guinea pig, her dark eyes burning with fierce flames. &quot;Dr. Su, have you finished collecting your experimental data? Now it&#x27;s my turn to test it myself. How much of your G-Level skill is actually real?&quot; Startled by his sudden outburst and the wild look in his eyes, Su Ching Xus heart skipped a beat. But there was no fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there was an even deeper almost frenzied excitement and anticipation. She likes this feeling. I like this feeling of being out of control where everything is beyond my control. Her beautiful eyes, which always shone with rationality, were now brimming with tears, revealing a yearning to unravel the talents of the strong and the powerful genes within them. Bring it on, she didn&#x27;t back down at all and said in a cocketish tone almost defiantly, &quot;Let me see if your clinical performance matches your seemingly perfect experimental data.&quot; As you wish.</p>
<p>Chapter 106. Old Chin slays the dragon. One man protects the nation. The deep abyss of the East China Sea, 10,000 m above the ground. This place is an absolute forbidden zone of the Dragon Sea Empire, shrouded year round by raging thunderclouds and dimensional storms that tear apart steel.</p>
<p>Ordinary fighter jets, let alone intruding, would be shredded into scrap metal by the terrifying power of nature, even if they came within a 100 miles. At this moment, a jet black fighter jet resembling the ancient mythical bird Kuan Pung ignored the devastating thunderstorm and silently tore through the clouds like a ghost hovering above the core of the restricted area. Inside the cockpit, Mr. Chen, dressed in a simple gray Jong Sean suit, was present. He sat cross-legged leisurely on the clean floor with a set of antique purple clay tea wear in front of him.</p>
<p>He remained calm as he brewed himself a cup of fragrant Dah Hongpow tea. It was as if he were attending a long-awaited tea party on the edge of a cliff rather than facing a cataclysmic star beast capable of destroying civilization. He picked up his teacup, gently blew away the foam, and spoke softly to the empty cockpit. Fire. A monochromatic female voice devoid of any emotion rang out in the cockpit.</p>
<p>Quimping received. Command confirmed. ElderQing. Divine punishment system activated. Target: Anomaly in the Earth&#x27;s vain energy below.</p>
<p>calibrating launch trajectory. The moment the command was given, the smooth armor on the belly of the Ku Pong fighter jet, representing the pinnacle of the Longot Empire&#x27;s technology, silently slid open, revealing a ferocious, massive cannon whose interior gleamed with destructive light. This cannon was one of only a handful in the entire empire. The Kuong fighter jet was specially configured for this elderly man. The main cannon of divine punishment is beginning to charge.</p>
<p>A beam of destructive light, brighter than the sun and powerful enough to pierce the Earth&#x27;s veins, suddenly shot out from the cannon, tearing through the sky and the thick sea water and blasted into the deep sea dragon&#x27;s nest that had been sleeping for nearly a thousand years with perfect precision. The next second, Roar Dash, a dragon&#x27;s roar, originating from the primordial era and carrying endless savagery and rage, resounded from the seabed tens of thousands of meters deep. The entire East China Sea boiled at the sound of that dragon&#x27;s roar. The sea surface was like boiling water, churning wildly and creating towering waves hundreds of meters high. A massive, indescribably thick column of water carrying the terrifying power to easily capsize an aircraft carrier shot into the sky.</p>
<p>At the top of the water column, a terrifying behemoth over 10,000 meters long with a dragon&#x27;s head and a human body and covered in crimson scales like burning lava revealed its true form from the deep sea. Eastern candle dragon peak of the eighth realm, a cataclysmic star beast capable of directly confronting two or three human marshall emperors. The moment it opened its pair of scarlet vertical pupils, which resembled two blood moons, the sky over the entire sea changed color. The terrifying dragon&#x27;s might, like a tangible shock wave, spread wildly in all directions, causing the surrounding dimensional storms to come to a standstill. Faced with this earthshattering power, Old Sheen remained calm and composed.</p>
<p>He slowly finished the last sip of tea in his cup before leisurely standing up. With one step, his figure appeared outside the fighter jet, standing with his hands behind his back in the void. The marshall will of a ninth realm demagod on his body transformed into an invisible barrier, completely isolating the dragon&#x27;s might, which was enough to make even a seventh realm war emperor tremble from the outside. Not even the hem of his simple Jehong suit was stirred. looking down at the candle dragon below, which was staring at him with eyes that looked down on an ant.</p>
<p>Old Sheen&#x27;s voice was calm, yet it clearly carried for miles around. Eastern candle dragon, I have come to take a drop of your heart&#x27;s blood for the continuation of the human race. Would you be willing to give it to me? These words sound like a discussion, but the tone revealed an undeniable intent to plunder. The Xulongs scarlet vertical pupils were filled with extreme contempt and tyranny. It opened its huge mouth, which was big enough to swallow mountains, and spoke in human language.</p>
<p>Its voice was like an eternal ice that exploded between heaven and earth. &quot;You ant, how dare you negotiate with me? Die?&quot; Before he finished speaking, a dark red dragon breath, 10 times more terrifying than the main cannon of heavenly punishment and capable of instantly evaporating the entire East China Sea, transformed into a pillar of death that pierced through the heavens and earth and roared toward the location where ElderQ was. Faced with this devastating attack, old Chin neither dodged nor evaded. He simply raised his right hand, fingers pointing like a sword, and gently slashed forward at the oncoming dragon breath of death. Certainly, a single word spoken becomes law.</p>
<p>His marshall will, which had accumulated his life&#x27;s cultivation and touched the threshold of the ninth realm, transformed into an invisible chain of laws at this moment, freezing the terrifying dragon breath, which was enough to destroy a city in midair. Time seemed to stand still at that moment. Julong&#x27;s scarlet vertical pupils widened instantly. What kind of power is this? Isn&#x27;t this old man a Marshall emperor level expert from the human race? Before it could even react to this unbelievable scene, Old Sheen&#x27;s figure appeared as if by teleportation in front of its massive mountainlike chest. He still held his fingers together like a sword and gently touched the hardest and most fatal reverse scale on the heart of the candle dragon.</p>
<p>Broken click. A crisp cracking sound rang out. That seemingly indestructible shield, strong enough to withstand a direct hit from a tactical nuclear weapon, shattered like fragile glass. Without pausing for a moment, Shinlau&#x27;s fingers pierced through the broken scales and tough dragon skin, precisely probing into the heart of the candle dragon, which was beating violently like a small sun. Photographed.</p>
<p>Using his finger as a guide, he forcefully extracted a drop of heart blood the size of a thumb from that enormous heart. A drop of crimson gold blood containing an indescribable amount of life energy. Puff. After doing all this, Old Sheen instantly returned to his fighter jet. As soon as he regained his footing, he abruptly covered his mouth.</p>
<p>But a mouthful of dark blood, which he couldn&#x27;t suppress, still gushed out from between his fingers, and his face turned as pale as paper in an instant. The old wound that had plagued him for nearly a century. The one he sustained while protecting the Dragon Sea Empire from the siege of three Federation 9th Realm Marshall emperors was aggravated once again after he forcefully used his primordial will. Cough. Cough.</p>
<p>He coughed violently a few times. And looking at the drop of Zhuongs heart blood in his palm, which still radiated terrifying heat and boundless vitality, a relieved smile appeared in his usually gentle and wise cloudy eyes. He placed this precious drop enough to drive any martial artist mad into a specially made jade bottle, then raised his head, his gaze seemingly piercing through endless space, landing in the direction of the distant Umbrella Corporation headquarters, and murmured to himself in a voice only he could hear. &quot;My child, these old bones of mine can&#x27;t hold on for many more years. You&#x27;d better hurry up and become the leader of the Dragon Sai Empire.</p>
<p>Grow up quickly.&quot; Chapter 107. In the land of gentle comfort, a new family is formed. The next afternoon, Shinuan woke up on Su Ching Xus messy experimental table, which looked as if a category 12 typhoon had passed through. This woman&#x27;s fighting power is even more terrifying than Long Yangs. The worst part is that she always pauses abruptly at crucial moments, pushes up her gold- rimmed glasses, which she seems to have put on again at some point, and begins to analyze his clinical performance in the cold tone of someone reading a lab report.</p>
<p>Heart rate 175, adrenaline soaring, dragon energy activity increased by 1.2%. This tactic is good. It can be included in regular research projects. The body temperature exceeds 39° C. The flame soul and dragon chi are beginning to show initial signs of fusion.</p>
<p>No, this method is too dangerous and could easily cause the experimental subject to spontaneously combust. It needs to be improved. He turned his head and glanced at his side. Such Chinhu, however, had already gotten out of bed looking radiant. Her exquisite gold- rimmed glasses had somehow returned to her high-nose bridge.</p>
<p>Her smooth seaweed-like hair was casually tied up with a pen, and her burgundy silk night gown was loosely tied. She was leaning against the headboard, intently recording something rapidly on the holographic screen in front of her. Her beautiful, intelligent, and aloof face was now filled with the fervor and satisfaction of a scientist discovering a new continent. During the intense 12-hour experiment, the experimental subject, Shun Yuan&#x27;s body, experienced a total of 17 energy peak fluctuations. Three superc critical reactions occurred during the 3rd, 7th, and 11th hours.</p>
<p>The two SS level energies, Dragon Chi and Flame Soul, under a state of extreme excitement, generated a new fused energy with annihilation properties. Although the appearance of this energy caused the experimental subjects to experience weakness symptoms such as muscle soreness, lethargy, and lower back and knee pain in the short term, the overall activity of their gene chains actually increased by 0.13% during the process of annihilation and recombination. Interesting. So interesting. As Shin Yuan listened to her earnest academic report, he felt his kidneys begin to ache again.</p>
<p>That woman is a complete mad woman. He sighed inwardly, feeling that he was probably doomed to be controlled by this female demon for the rest of his life. Whether it&#x27;s her G-Level human nuclear weapon or her S-level gene insight talent, they are practically her natural enemies. Su Ching Xu seemed to notice his gaze. She turned her head and looked at Shan Yuan&#x27;s utterly exhausted appearance.</p>
<p>A lazy yet satisfied smile curving her lips. She lazily rolled over, her wine red silk robe now practically useless. With her movement, her G-Level human nuclear weapon and her incredibly elastic voluuptuous curves encased in pure black stockings were faintly visible in the afternoon sunlight. &quot;Are you awake, my dear experimental subject?&quot; Her voice carried a hint of husky rasping from gluttony and a touch of feminine allure. Looking at her like this, Shin Yuan felt his body, which had just been fed, become drymouthed again, much to his dismay.</p>
<p>That vixen, as evening fell, when Shin Yuan and Su Chingu entered the luxurious restaurant reserved for them, the scene before them startled him slightly. The large dining table was already full of people. Lynn, Sharon, Natasha, Ling, and even Lung Yu, the mature woman in black stockings who had been ignored by him just a few days ago, were all on the list. The huge restaurant had become his her tea party. The atmosphere, while harmonious, carried an indescribable eeriness.</p>
<p>Lynn Sharon, with a gentle and tender demeanor, was wearing a loose maternity dress and affectionately holding Long Yings arm, sweetly calling her sister Longing. and L Yings usually cold and aloof face showed a rare hint of gentleness at this moment. Although she was pregnant, her powerful SS level dragon soul battle body allowed her to recover extremely quickly. At this moment, she no longer showed any signs of the fatigue of the past few days. Instead, because of the new life force in her womb, which was connected to her by blood, her whole demeanor had become much gentler.</p>
<p>She had lost some of the sharpness of a warrior and gained more of the radiance of motherhood. She was enthusiastically discussing a thick several hundredpage prenatal education guide for dragon born shielan infants which such had just printed out with Lin Char who was also heavily pregnant and Natasha who stood to the side with a submissive expression. I think the guide is right. We should listen to more classical music to cultivate children&#x27;s sentiments and artistic talents. Lynn Sharon stroked her lower abdomen, her face full of anticipation.</p>
<p>Our baby will definitely be a gentle and refined artist. Natasha shook her head, earnestly, retorting in her somewhat broken long shell language. Art can&#x27;t put food on the table. I think he should listen to Imperial military briefings and Federation stock market analyses every day. We need to cultivate his strategic vision and business acumen from a young age.</p>
<p>The two were arguing and both turned their gazes toward Longing, who held the highest position. Longing pondered for a moment, her cool and pretty face becoming serious. What you&#x27;re saying is useless. She looked up at the vast training field outside the window, her tone serious. While in the womb, a fetus is most sensitive to external energies.</p>
<p>The best prenatal education is to let the fetus experience the true meaning of martial arts in advance. Lynch and Natasha were completely confused. Longing continued, &quot;After we finish eating, I&#x27;ll go spar with Shen Yuan. You all can watch from the sidelines, letting the baby in my womb feel the supremely young and powerful dragon energy and the clash of martial arts. This is the ultimate prenatal education to give you a head start.</p>
<p>Lynn Churin, Natasha, the two expectant mothers looked at each other, not knowing how to respond to Long Yings serious expression. Is it appropriate to have pregnant women watch life or death battles between experts at the fifth realm as prenatal education? As expected of you, Commander Long. Three expectant mothers from different countries and with very different personalities have formed a surprisingly harmonious transnational alliance of expectant mothers because of the common bond they share in their wombs. Only Lung Yu maintained the black stockings and bodycon skirt combat outfit that had allowed her to successfully seduce someone once, but which had also led to her being neglected. She sat alone in the corner of the dining table, swirling the red wine in her glass.</p>
<p>A stark contrast to the warm and harmonious atmosphere of the pregnant women&#x27;s group over there. She was like a lone wolf rejected by its pack. Her eyes cold yet carrying an undisguised sense of loneliness and resentment. Looking at the three women enjoying themselves, especially Ling, who was surrounded by Lin Char and Natasha like a star, she felt a pang of regret. She firmly believed that Shun Yuan didn&#x27;t choose her that night because she changed into that damn yoga outfit.</p>
<p>They are completely unprofessional and undedicated. If she had known this would happen, she shouldn&#x27;t have hesitated. Now things are really messed up. Longing has already graduated and I&#x27;m almost out of even having a chance to get in line. Just then, the restaurant door was pushed open.</p>
<p>When everyone saw Shin Yuan, especially Su Ching Xu behind him, who was wearing only a loose burgundy silk robe and gold rimmed glasses, exuding a lazy and charming air and scholarly aura. The entire restaurant fell silent, especially the two icy beauties, Long Ing and L Yu. Their eyes changed the moment they saw Su Ching Xu. Their figures are already considered perfect by most women. One possesses both strength and physique, while the other is tall and slender with incredibly long legs.</p>
<p>But compared to Su Ching Xus unreasonable G-Level human nuclear weaponry, their pride and joy were utterly crushed. That figure, that charisma, Ling and Lyu exchanged a glance, experiencing for the first time a profound sense of defeat, as if they were being outmatched on this track called female charm. They are women, and even they are hard to resist. A silent plume of gunpowder smoke filled the air. Chapter 108.</p>
<p>A new order in the family. The isolated blackstocking mature woman. The atmosphere at the dinner table became increasingly strange with the arrival of Su Ching Zhu. As the nominal empress and the first woman to conceive Shan Yuans child, Lin Sharon felt it was necessary to stand up for her man and defuse this silent conflict. She put down her milk and gave Su Ching Zhu, who was sitting elegantly next to Shun Yuan, a gentle and graceful smile.</p>
<p>Sister Su, come sit here. As soon as Lin Char finished speaking, a cold voice mixed with a hint of resentment and mockery drifted over from the corner. Dr. Su, your research last night must have been very demanding, right? The one speaking was Lyu. She swirled the red wine in her glass, but her gaze was fixed on Su Chingu, and she emphasized the word research in her words.</p>
<p>This ambiguous greeting caused the temperature at the dining table to plummet. Longing snorted coldly, although she didn&#x27;t say anything, her icy phoenix eyes swept over Su Ching Zhu with scrutiny and fighting spirit. She could tolerate other women around Shinuan, but she absolutely could not tolerate her man being taken advantage of by a woman who openly denied her martial arts methods and was completely at odds with her. He&#x27;s been tortured into this terrible state. Despite the almost blatant hostility, Su Ching Zhu remained unconcerned.</p>
<p>She gracefully picked up a napkin, wiped her mouth, and first gave Lin Char a gentle smile. Then her gaze shifted to Lung Yu, and her smile took on a more piercing quality. Fortunately, in order to protect the future of the Umbrella Corporation and to build the dragon blood tempering pool as soon as possible so that everyone in Dragon can become like a dragon, no matter how hard it is, it is all worth it. She paused, then changed the subject, her gaze sweeping over the two pretty faces of Long Ing and L Yu, who had both changed expression simultaneously. She spoke in an authoritative tone, almost as if reciting a research report.</p>
<p>After all, some experimental materials have immense potential, and their gene sequences are extremely rare in the world, making them very worthy of our repeated and comprehensive research. She directly elevated her private affairs with Shun Yuan to a strategic level concerning the company&#x27;s future. This made the petty jealousy and rivalry between Longing and Lung Yu pale in comparison. Ling was speechless and unable to refute. Are you suggesting that while you can do research, you shouldn&#x27;t go to such extremes? How could she say such a thing? She could only treat the expensive piece of crimson flame beef on the plate in front of her as Su Ching Xus face, cutting it back and forth with her knife and fork.</p>
<p>After hearing Su Ching Xus words, Lung Yu felt an even stronger sense of crisis and frustration. She couldn&#x27;t understand where she had gone wrong. In terms of figure, aren&#x27;t my incredible long legs and near-perfect S-class figure more alluring than Lynn Churin, who only knows how to bury herself in books, and Longing, who wears military boots barefoot. In terms of taking initiative, she even used a powerful weapon like a black stocking and bodycon skirt a few days ago. Does this man have absolutely no interest in someone like me who&#x27;s offering herself up? Or is it that my professional skills are not good enough? She gripped the knife and forked tightly, looking at the carefully chosen, sheer black stockings on her legs.</p>
<p>A wilder, bolder idea began to sprout in her mind. Since the conventional approach isn&#x27;t working, we have to use a more direct, more forceful, and more irresistible method. The dinner party ended in this strange atmosphere filled with tension. As Su Chingu left, she pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses on Shan Yuans nose. Behind the lenses, her beautiful eyes, shimmering with tears, silently invited him to continue their research that evening.</p>
<p>Shinyuan immediately understood. He quickly stepped forward, first speaking kindly to Ling, who was clearly growing jealous, then kissing Lin Char&#x27;s cheek, who was already somewhat worried, assuring her that he would definitely come back early tonight. Only then, under the complicated gazes of the two women, did he immediately follow them. Seeing this scene, Lung Yu sitting in the corner felt her proud heart sink to the bottom. She had even lost the last bit of courage to go up and talk to him.</p>
<p>She watched as Shin Yuan followed another woman away without hesitation. Shin Yuan followed Su Chingu back to her private laboratory. He had expected tonight to begin another round of academic discussions about the mysteries of the human body. Contrary to her usual behavior, Su Chingu did not immediately make a move against him. Instead, he transferred a document to his personal terminal and his expression became very serious.</p>
<p>This is all the publicly available information about Mu Wan Bing and a psychological profile model built by the company&#x27;s intelligence department based on all her past behavioral patterns. Such pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, revealing a pair of beautiful eyes behind the lenses that sparkled with intelligence. This woman is extremely rational, extremely arrogant, and one could even say she has a somewhat antisocial personality. She had no interest in men whatsoever. In her eyes, men fell into only two categories: useful tools and useless trash.</p>
<p>Ordinary male charm has no effect on her at all. It may even arouse her strong aversion and contempt. As she said this, a sly smile suddenly appeared on her lips. So if you want to win her over, your brute strength and your decent martial arts skills alone won&#x27;t do. You need to make her feel that you are smarter and more valuable than her.</p>
<p>Su Chinghu, whom Shin Yuan had personally hired, leaned close to his ear and earnestly warned him. Therefore, I have prepared a complete hunting plan for you. From the very first meeting, I&#x27;ve already planned everything for you. what clothes to wear, what to say, what tone to use, and even the exact minute and second to make the right micro expressions to perfectly capture her heart. Shinyuan was deeply shocked.</p>
<p>Looking at the strategist in front of him, who was giving him advice, he truly felt the terror of an S-level insight type talent. Before he could even feel moved, Such Chingu abruptly changed the subject, licking her full red lips and saying with ill intent, &quot;Of course, this plan is only theoretical after all. Its final effect still needs to be determined through a realworld simulation. So, she looked at Shin Yuan with a hunter&#x27;s excited smile like that of someone spotting their prey. Tonight, I&#x27;ll personally play the role of that aloof and icy female CEO.</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, she had already raised her hand and lightly tapped the virtual keyboard on the control panel. Laugh. The heavy alloy door closed and locked with a dull thud as it released pressure. Suching Zhu turned around and gave Shin Yuan, who was dumbfounded, a smile that could charm the world. Simulation exercise now begins.</p>
<p>Shinuan, someone please save me. Chapter 109. Morning. On the morning of the third day, Lie Yun and Xiao Jingua hurried over to Su Ching Xus private laboratory carrying a speciallymade Shiin Bing jade bottle. Inside the bottle was the heart blood of the candle dragon, which the company&#x27;s employee had personally retrieved.</p>
<p>Even through the jade bottle, one could still feel the immense hellish life energy and terrifyingly high temperature. When the heavy alloy door slid open silently, the two men stopped in their tracks, and their expressions were incredibly interesting when they saw what was inside. In the huge laboratory, Shinuan had dark circles under his eyes and pale lips. He was leaning weakly against the cold wall, while his other hand was holding a bottle of high energy nutrient solution that was thicker than his arm, which he was gulping down. His extremely weak appearance made even Xiao Jinga, a fifth level Grandmaster, twitch at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Su Chingu looked radiant and full of energy. That exquisitly beautiful face, so intellectual and aloof, was flushed with a captivating blush, adding a touch of mature allure to her already captivating appearance. She was only wearing a white lab coat, the collar of which was wide open. The black lace dress that Shin Yuan had personally chosen for her the night before was faintly visible through the gaps in the white lab coat, sparking the imagination. She was leaning against the control panel, wearing her signature gold rimmed glasses, staring intently at the holographic screen in front of her.</p>
<p>Her fingers flew across the screen, recording dense data, while she muttered discontentedly like a tireless research fanatic. No, it still won&#x27;t work. The experimental body&#x27;s energy reserves are declining too quickly. The fluctuation rate of the simulation data in the second half of last night exceeded 15% which is not accurate enough. The variables must be strictly controlled.</p>
<p>We need to conduct another full 12-hour experiment tonight and try to keep the error within 5%. Upon hearing this, Shin Yuan, who was leaning against the wall and gulping down nutrient solution, felt his legs go weak and almost knelt down before this female demon on the spot. Are you coming again, sis? Are you doing scientific research or are you trying to kill me? What left Lie Yun and Xiao Jing was speechless was that after Shun Yuan finished drinking the high energy nutrient solution and caught his breath, he didn&#x27;t move away from the source of danger at all. Instead, he stuck to it again like a piece of chewing gum without any bones. Let me smell it again.</p>
<p>Dr. Su, the allure of your research is just too intoxicating. Looking at Shan Yuans pathetic behavior and then at his own wife&#x27;s figure, which although well-maintained, could not escape the marks of time, Xiaoing was filled with mixed feelings. Finally, all emotions culminated in a heartfelt expression of awe and self-deprecation. &quot;This woman is even more ferocious than those blood demons in the Federation that specialize in sucking men&#x27;s life essence,&quot; he added with a sense of empathy.</p>
<p>&quot;Our company&#x27;s young master, Mr. Shan almost got himself killed by his own people. Serves you right. Lean was both annoyed and amused. She couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer and gave Xiao Jingua a wink.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s not get in the way here. Let&#x27;s wait outside. Xiao Jingua coughed lightly, nodded in deep agreement, and pulled his wife out of the laboratory. The heavy alloy doors slowly closed behind them.</p>
<p>A full half hour later, the laboratory door opened again. Such came out. She had already straightened her white coat, but as she moved, she seemed to be adjusting the row of buttons on her chest. The top button was still loosely open, revealing a small patch of fair skin and delicate collar bone. The blush on her face didn&#x27;t fade.</p>
<p>Instead, it made her even more radiant. Seeing Li Yun and Xiao Jingua waiting at the door, she calmly pushed up her glasses as if nothing had just happened. Sister Lee, Commander Xiao, sorry to keep you waiting. I was just confirming some final details of the experimental data with consultant Shin, which took a little longer. Lean pointed at her, so angry she could barely speak.</p>
<p>You, you, and I asked you to replenish his energy, not to treat him like a guinea pig, and torture him to death. She pulled Su Chingu aside, lowered her voice, and warned her in a tone of disappointment. You need to understand what sustainable development means. This is our company&#x27;s treasure. If you damage it, can you afford to pay for it? Su Ching Xu blushed at Leans words, revealing a rare hint of girish embarrassment and whispered a defense.</p>
<p>I I&#x27;m doing this for science. Besides, he&#x27;s enjoying it himself. Lean rolled her eyes at her, which finally brought the topic back on track. After the joke, the atmosphere became serious. Ziaoin has solemnly handed the speciallymade jade bottle containing the blood of the candle dragon to Sue Ching Zhu.</p>
<p>Ching Zu. This is the heart&#x27;s blood of the eastern candle dragon, a peak eighth realm star beast just brought back from the abyss of the east sea. You must immediately set to work diluting and purifying it as quickly as possible and then preparing it into the core potion needed for the dragon blood tempering pool. Understood. Suing took the jade bottle, her beautiful eyes, which had just been filled with amusement, immediately becoming incredibly focused and fervent.</p>
<p>This is the lifeblood of a peak level star beast of the eighth realm. She was the legendary top tier experimental material that she might never be able to access in her entire life. Leun then walked up to Shinuan. Shin Yuan effective immediately. You will serve as our umbrella corporation&#x27;s special technical adviser representing the company at the East China Sea branch of Tion Shin Industries to conduct final negotiations with the mysterious female CEO Mu Wan Bing regarding the construction project of the Dragon Blood Tempering Pool.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt the pressure mounting again. Such Ching Zhu seemed to sense his reluctance, so she walked to Shun Yuan&#x27;s side and put a brand new miniature brainwave communicator, which looked no different from an ordinary earring, on his ear. She leaned close to his ear and smiled confidently. &quot;Go ahead without worry, my experimental subject. I have obtained all of Mu Wan Bings public information through the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s internal network, as well as a top secret psychological profile of her written by a top federal psychologist.</p>
<p>During the negotiations later, I will provide you with tactical guidance throughout the process. The curve of her lips became increasingly cunning. I want to see whether her icy heart is colder or whether my genetic insight is superior. With Su Ching Xus powerful support as a guarantee, Shinuan&#x27;s pressure was greatly reduced. Chapter 110.</p>
<p>The stunningly beautiful icy female CEO. Nighttime in the most bustling CBD of Donghai City. A skyscraper over 300 meters tall, entirely constructed of black glass curtain walls, stands silently in the city&#x27;s night like a sharp sword piercing the sky. This is the East China branch of Tianin industry, a business giant with immense wealth that rivals that of a nation and controls the most advanced civilian technology in the entire Langia Empire. Top floor CEO&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>The private magnetic levitation elevator doors slid open silently and Shin Yuan walked in alone. The office was incredibly large and incredibly cold. The floor was made of black marble that reflected people&#x27;s images. And apart from the enormous obsidian desk and two chairs, there were no other decorations. Outside the floor to ceiling windows that cover the entire wall, the city lights are dazzling.</p>
<p>But here, one can only feel the loneliness of being at such a high place. Behind the desk, the legendary, eternally icy female CEO, Muan Bing, who was said to be even colder than Longing, finally appeared before him. She was looking down at a document and didn&#x27;t even lift her eyes when the elevator arrived. A perfectly tailored silver gray women&#x27;s suit skirt, the suit jacket unbuttoned, revealing a pure white silk shirt underneath, the shirt collar tied with an exquisite bow tie, exuding an austere yet capable elite aura. The bodycon skirt she wore hugged her shapely curves perfectly, and her straight jade-like legs encased in fleshcoled stockings were elegantly crossed.</p>
<p>Her appearance was impeccable with a classic oval face and exquisite features like works of art. Her long jet black hair was neatly coiled at the back of her head, adding to her aloofness and majesty. Appearance score 98 or above. However, her aloofness towards the world, coupled with a natural aversion to male creatures, makes her far more dangerous than Ling. Could this woman simply be a misogynist? Shin Yuan muttered to himself.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat, preparing to deliver a passionate opening speech according to Su Ching Xus script. Muan Bing didn&#x27;t even look up. She simply raised her hand and interrupted him with a cold, emotionless tone. No need to introduce yourself. I&#x27;m not interested in who you are.</p>
<p>She pushed a pre-prepared document to the edge of her desk. Well discuss solutions. This woman is more difficult to deal with than I expected. Shin Yuan, on the contrary, found it rather interesting. He pulled out a chair and sat down opposite her in a very natural and unpretentious manner.</p>
<p>In his mind, Su Ching Xus slightly playful voice rang out. The target exhibits an extremely strong desire for control and a fastidious approach to efficiency. Let her make the first move and don&#x27;t disrupt her rhythm. This type of extremely self-confident woman loves the feeling of being in control. The more you go along with her, the more she will lower her guard.</p>
<p>Shinyuan understood, picked up the thick document on the table, and actually started flipping through it page by page. When Muan Bing saw that he was actually looking at the documents instead of trying to make small talk like other men, a barely perceptible hint of approval flashed in her cold phoenix eyes. What she hates most is wasting time. I&#x27;ve seen the blueprints. Muan spoke coldly, pinpointing the core issue precisely.</p>
<p>The design concept was incredibly advanced, even groundbreaking. However, its feasibility was highly questionable. Most importantly, the 100 billion budget offered by your umbrella corporation is, in my opinion, a joke. She extended three slender white fingers like works of art and gently tap them on the table. To turn this blueprint into reality and achieve the desired effect, at least 300 billion is needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all core technologies, anti-gravity construction equipment, and nanocale precision machining are entirely the sole responsibility of Tianin industry. Your company is not allowed to interfere with the specific details of the project for any reason. 300 billion. Even though Shun Yuan was mentally prepared, he was still surprised by this woman&#x27;s appetite. However, Mu Wamings next words showed him what capitalist greed truly meant.</p>
<p>Once the project is completed, ownership can belong to your company. However, Tion Shen Industrial must be entitled to 30% of the project&#x27;s net profit for the next 50 years. After she finished speaking, she leaned back in her chair, her cold phoenix eyes looking at Shun Yuan with the sharpest scanning lenses. Do you have any objections? Or to put it another way, can you make this decision on behalf of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters? Sending such an inexperienced young man from the Umbrella Corporation headquarters to discuss such a large deal with her is an insult to her and the entire Celestial Industries. She was prepared that if Shan Yuan dared to say no or show the slightest sign of difficulty, she would immediately end this pointless negotiation and unceremoniously ask him to leave.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan&#x27;s reaction was completely beyond her expectations. Faced with these extremely demanding conditions, Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t even hesitate before closing the document in his hand and nodding decisively. No problem. Do as you say. These three casually uttered words caused a crack to appear on Mu Wan Bings icy, beautiful face.</p>
<p>Her delicate brows furrowed slightly, and a hint of anger flashed in her beautiful eyes. What she hates most is this kind of prefuncter and unprofessional attitude. You agreed so readily. Her voice was three degrees colder than before. Do you know what 300 billion and a 30% profit mean for a business project? Or perhaps you didn&#x27;t understand what I just said at all and are just a puppet sent from above who only knows how to nod and bow.</p>
<p>Through the earphones, Su Chingu&#x27;s suppressed, excited laughter could be heard. The fish has taken the bait. Her heart rate has increased by 8%. Her pupils have constricted by 0.2 mm and she&#x27;s starting to get emotional. Now&#x27;s the time.</p>
<p>Use the talking techniques I taught you to completely break down her defenses. Shinyuan put down the documents, leaned forward slightly, and stared intently into Mu Wan Bings cold eyes with his usually nonchalant dark eyes. He smiled. That smile carried a hint of mockery and a touch of compassionate pity. Mr.</p>
<p>Mu, the reason I agreed so readily is not because I&#x27;m stupid, nor because I&#x27;m some kind of puppet relaying messages. Rather, it&#x27;s because I know that once this thing is built, it&#x27;s impossible for it to generate any profit whatsoever. The 300 billion investment you mentioned and the 30% net profit dividend. Shinyuan looked at her face, which changed instantly and said word by word from the very beginning. It was a false proposition that never existed.</p>
<p>Chapter 111. Mu Wan Bing, who had been making outrageous demands, finally couldn&#x27;t hold back anymore. These words stunned Mu Wan Bing on the spot. She had imagined countless negotiation scenarios and heated debates. She never expected that the other party would actually flip the table and tell her that the business model she had been talking about for so long was just a joke.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked, puzzled. Shinuan looked at her forced composure, but her eyes were beginning to waver and his smile deepened. He stood up and walked to the huge floor toseeiling window, gazing at the bustling and dazzling city night view outside, yet with undercurrents surging beneath, his voice becoming low. Mr. Moo, you&#x27;ve been in the business world for a long time and are used to measuring everything by money and profit, which is normal.</p>
<p>But in places you can&#x27;t see, on this border of the East China Sea, in those no man&#x27;s land shrouded by dimensional storms, there are tens of thousands of martial artists like me or even younger than me. They are just ordinary martial artists in the mortal world, but they are using their own flesh and blood to protect this prosperous land for us. Many of them are not very talented and have limited resources. They may spend their entire lives without ever breaking through even a small level. They could die silently at any moment in the battle against the star beasts, leaving behind not even a complete corpse.</p>
<p>In this pool, Shin Yuan turned around and in his dark eyes burned a raging flame. A flame called faith. It&#x27;s not for making money. It is free for those martial artists who may give their lives for this world at any time. It is not limited to the warriors of our umbrella corporation.</p>
<p>It is a powerful tool used to strengthen the foundation of the entire empire, cultivate more powerful individuals, and prepare for the potential war of annihilation that may break out at any time in the future. Mr. Mu, you&#x27;ve been talking to me about prophets for so long. Did you make a mistake from the very beginning? His words were powerful and resounding like the sharpest sword, instantly cleaving open Mu Wan Binging heart, which had been frozen for many years and was now filled only with self-interest and scheming. Muan Bing was stunned.</p>
<p>For the first time, emotions of shock and disbelief appeared on that beautiful, usually cold, and expressionless face. She was born into one of the empires most prestigious families and received the most elite education from a young age. In her world, everything is tradable and everything has a price. She had never experienced such pure, selfless human compassion that disregarded all costs and was willing to sacrifice everything. I deep within her heart, a place she had long forgotten, even despised, seemed to be touched just as she was in shock and her mind was in chaos.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t know how to answer this fatal question. Shin Yuan spoke again. This time, his voice was no longer as oppressive as before. Instead, it carried a roguish, cynical tone. Of course, I can understand the conditions you proposed, Mr.</p>
<p>Mu. After all, it&#x27;s a 300 billion yuan project. Your ton shin industry should have some hope, right? He abruptly changed the subject, revealing an extremely smug and wicked grin. Let&#x27;s skip the profit sharing and such. After all, this is a public welfare project.</p>
<p>Talking about money would only hurt our feelings. However, as a partner, Tion Shin Industrial must have priority access to this project. Is this condition too demanding? Muan being instinctively wanted to nod. This condition is reasonable. Shin Yuans next words, however, caused her pretty face, which had just begun to soften, to turn frosty again.</p>
<p>&quot;No problem,&quot; Shin Yuan immediately answered for her. then with an extremely flippant tone, chuckled mischievously. However, let me make it clear from the outset that this is not the best approach. After this pool is built, my women and I will definitely go down there to consecrate it. If you want to try it, don&#x27;t be picky.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll just use our bath water. You Mu Wan Bings chest heaved violently with anger at his flippant and rude words. How dare this man humiliate her. Shin Yuan continued to rub salt into her wound with a grin. Oh, right.</p>
<p>I almost forgot. I will also invite your sister, that globally famous singer, Ms. Mu Chingshi, to be the first to experience our soup. After all, I promised her a unique happiness at the banquet in front of everyone. Upon hearing this, Mu Wanings expression, which had been frozen for over 20 years, finally cracked.</p>
<p>She can no longer maintain her aloof and icy CEO image. He slammed his hand on the table. He stood up from his seat, pointed at Shun Yuans nose, and shouted angrily in a fit of rage. You&#x27;re the shameless scoundrel who boasted at Zhao Yis banquet that he wanted to marry my sister. Shameless scoundrel.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan touched his nose, a very innocent expression on his face. Mr. Mu, you can&#x27;t say that. This is mutual affection. How does that make me shameless? Besides, your sister herself publicly agreed that she would marry me after I win the Heavenly Pride tournament.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all in black and white and there&#x27;s video evidence. As he spoke, he actually opened his personal terminal and a holographic screen was projected onto Mu Wan Bing less than half a meter away. The scene depicted is from the night of the banquet. Mu Wings pupils suddenly contracted. She saw her usually aloof and ethereal younger sister with flushed cheeks, her eyes brimming with an adoration and adoration she had never seen before.</p>
<p>Then under the man&#x27;s affectionate gaze in the video, her silly little sister actually nodded heavily. That whispered yet perfectly clear voice recorded through the equipment said, &quot;I will marry.&quot; It struck Mu Wan Bings heart again and again. Seeing her younger sister&#x27;s shy and adorable appearance, completely blinded by love, she was so angry that she couldn&#x27;t control the expression on her face. The Moo family cherished their precious little sister, protecting her with utmost care. Yet, she was easily deceived by this smooth-talking rogue with just a few words.</p>
<p>The sight of that smug, roguish expression almost gave Mu Wan being a stroke on the spot. Su Ching Xus voice suppressing extreme excitement and sly laughter rang out in the earphones at just the right moment. Well done. You hit her biggest sore spot. Quick, add fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>Tell her that her sister has much better taste than she does. At the same time, Su Chingu quickly transmitted a piece of Mu Wan Bings dark history, which was classified as SSS level top secret directly into Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind through mental power. Chapter 112. The iceberg CEO&#x27;s dark history is actually Akasha. Mu Wan Bing, one of the heirs of Tianin industry, has been a favored daughter of heaven since childhood.</p>
<p>But when she was 20, she suffered the biggest setback of her life. She once fell madly in love with a boy of ordinary background but with extraordinary talent. Despite the family&#x27;s opposition, they used the vast resources of Tion Shun industry to cultivate and help him, transforming him from a penniles poor boy into the most dazzling dark horse in that year&#x27;s Imperial Pride battle. However, the man to whom she placed all her hopes and feelings betrayed her without mercy after the battle of the heavenly pride for the sake of greater power and a more beautiful woman. He not only absconded with a core technology of celestial industries, but also defected directly to the Free Federation, becoming a senior adviser to the Federation military.</p>
<p>The one who lured him into treason was none other than Akasha von Rothschild, a direct descendant of the most prestigious family in the Free Federation, the Von Rothschild family. It is said that the man fell completely in love with Akasha after only seeing her face once, abandoning everything Mu Wan Bing had paved for him and followed her like a dog. just to become one of Akasha&#x27;s many suitors. From then on, Mu Wambings personality changed drastically. She froze all her emotions, turning herself into an eternal iceberg that believed only in self-interest and loathed all men.</p>
<p>What? Shin Yuan was stunned the moment he received this information. Subconsciously, right in front of Muan Bing, he let out a heartfelt sigh into the air, the earphone. How could such a beautiful and extremely wealthy woman be dumped? How could such a smart and calculating woman be deceived? Is that man blind? This was a completely subconscious retort like the sharpest knife stabbing precisely into Mu Wan Bings already riddled heart to expose her most shameful and least wanted to be mentioned scars to her face. This is no longer just a humiliation. This is the most cruel way to desecrate a corpse.</p>
<p>However, in a flash, Shinuan remembered something else. Akasha Shinuan thought for a moment. What if the opponent was that woman? Shinyuan thoughts immediately became clear. He looked at Mu Wan Bing, whose face had turned pale with anger and suddenly grinned, muttering to himself in a tone of sudden realization. Oh, so it&#x27;s that woman, Akasha.</p>
<p>Never mind then. He smacked his lips and commented with an air of seriousness. To be honest, if it were her, that guy&#x27;s taste is actually pretty good. She&#x27;s beautiful, has a great figure, is capable, and has status. If it were me, I&#x27;d probably choose her, too.</p>
<p>Shut up. Muan Bing was trembling with rage. Her beautiful eyes churning with humiliation and fury. Akasha von Rothschild. This name is the biggest nightmare of her life.</p>
<p>It is the root of all her previous pain and shame. How did he know that name? How could they dare say such a thing to my face? You are not allowed to come near my sister again. Mu Wanings voice became somewhat sharp due to extreme anger, losing its usual composure. You&#x27;re so glib and smoothtalking. At first glance, you look like a scumbag who specializes in deceiving women&#x27;s feelings.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s no different from that scumbag I knew back then. Oh. Shiny Yuan raised an eyebrow and intensified his actions. He and I are not the same. He paused, then continued in a nonchalant tone.</p>
<p>The woman he couldn&#x27;t win over is now my prisoner. He doesn&#x27;t even deserve to be a dog while I can make her have my children. So the happiness I can give to a woman is something you and that traitor can never imagine. Looking at the icy female CEO in front of him who had been driven completely out of control by his anger, he decided to add fuel to the fire and completely ignite this volcano that was about to erupt. Okay then, Mr.</p>
<p>Mu, let&#x27;s make a bet. Looking into Mu Wan Bings angry and resentful eyes, he made a bet. Let&#x27;s bet on this battle of imperial prodigies. If I win the final championship, you can no longer interfere with my relationship with your sister for any reason, and you must agree to one condition that you cannot refuse. If I lose, I promise to stay far away from her from now on and never see her again.</p>
<p>Seeing her wavering expression, Shun Yuan&#x27;s smile deepened, and he added another heart-wrenching remark. And for your sister&#x27;s sake, I can help you get revenge. That woman named Akasha is in my hands now. I can humiliate you 10fold for all the injustices you suffered back then, making her cry and beg for mercy. How about it? This bet gave Muan Bing, who was enraged and humiliated, a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Battle of the Prodigies. That was the highest level stage that brought together all the top young geniuses of the entire Dragon Xiao Empire. The man she had poured so much of her resources into nurturing only managed to get a top five finish. The man before them, though somewhat mysterious, was ultimately just a useless frank talent. What gave him the audacity to boast about winning the championship? He&#x27;s humiliating himself.</p>
<p>As for Akasha, she was in his hands. In an instant, a piece of intelligence that had shaken the entire empire a few days ago flashed through Mu Wan Bings mind. A Marshall emperor of the eighth realm from the vaugh Rothschild family, disregarding the peace agreement, personally descended upon the border of the East China Sea and openly threatened the East China Sea military region, demanding that they hand over an important member of their family. For an eighth realm Marshall emperor to lose his composure like this, the identity of that important member must be extraordinary. Could he be telling the truth? The woman who was high above him like a goddess who took everything from him has truly become his captive.</p>
<p>Good. Muan Bing stared at him calmly. Her rationality and calculations rekindled as a business queen. She practically gritted her teeth as she agreed to the bet which she believed she was certain to win. I&#x27;ll bet you contract.</p>
<p>She uttered two words. Shinuan smiled. He walked to his desk, picked up the cooperation agreement about the dragon blood tempering pool that he had just rejected, and signed his name on it with a flourish. Then the agreement was pushed back to Muan Bing. Mr.</p>
<p>Mu, please. Muan Bing looked at the agreement he had already signed and then at the man in front of her with a confident yet irritating smile on his face. A sense of absurdity welled up in her heart. I feel like I&#x27;ve fallen into a trap that she&#x27;s carefully set up once again. She picked up the pen and with an almost cathartic force signed her name on the agreement when two names appear side by side on the same document.</p>
<p>A strange feeling inexplicably arose in Mu Wan Bings heart. It seems that this is not a commercial contract. It was a contract of servitude. After the negotiations ended, Muan Bing returned to her usual ICEO persona. She stood up, ready to leave this place of trouble and turmoil that was making her feel so upset.</p>
<p>Looking at her slender, upright figure, exuding an aura of aestheticism, Shinuan found himself genuinely intrigued by this seemingly cold but actually foolish woman. At that very moment, the office door was gently pushed open. A sweet-l lookinging, seemingly harmless female assistant, dressed in the standard uniform of Tianin Industrial walked in carrying two cups of freshly brewed coffee. She bowed respectfully to Mu Wand, &quot;Mr. Mu, your car is ready at the entrance of the building.&quot; However, the moment she spoke, Shinuan heard Su Ching Xus incredibly sharp and urgent warning voice.</p>
<p>No, Shinuan, watch out. I monitored her and scanned her genetic sequence. Her genetic model didn&#x27;t match the assistance in the database at all. She&#x27;s an impostor. Her cellular activity and energy fluctuations were at least at the level of a fifth realm Grandmaster.</p>
<p>Moreover, her adrenaline and heart rate were extremely abnormal, carrying a strong killing intent. She&#x27;s not an assistant. She&#x27;s an assassin. Chapter 113. The Fifth Realm Assassin, ElderQen&#x27;s Marshall Will.</p>
<p>Before the words were even finished, suddenly a fierce glint appeared in the female assistant&#x27;s eyes. The two cups of scalding coffee in her hands silently disintegrated in midair as she handed them over. The brown liquid evaporated and transformed into two energy daggers that shimmerred with a ghostly blue light and were clearly coated with deadly poison. The assassination came without warning and its speed broke the sound barrier accompanied by a sharp whistling sound. It aimed directly at Mu Wanings heart and the back of her head from the left and right.</p>
<p>This is a fatal blow from a peak fifth realm Grandmaster. Protect President Mu. The sixth realm female bodyguard guarding the door shouted sharply immediately sensing the killing intent and sprang up to rush in. However, another accomplice disguised as a security guard suddenly attacked at the same time, unleashing an equally powerful aura that kept her firmly entangled outside the door. Death struck in the office.</p>
<p>Muan Bing watched helplessly as the two eerie blue beams of death rapidly magnified in her pupils. A look of horror and despair appeared on her frozen pretty face. Am I going to die? Die at the pinnacle of the business empire he built with his own hands. It&#x27;s utterly ridiculous. In that split second, in the blink of an eye, life and death hung in the balance.</p>
<p>Shinyuan made a move. Without the slightest hesitation, the body&#x27;s instincts outpaced the brain&#x27;s thinking. He pushed off with his feet and shot out like a cannonball, rushing to the back of Muan Bang. Just a second before the two poison daggers were about to pierce her body. He opened his arms and pulled that perfect, delicate body, stiff and cold with shock, into a tight embrace from behind.</p>
<p>Then Shin Yuan used his not so broad back to face the two deadly blades of death. Don&#x27;t want. Mu Wan Bing let out a scream, her voice filled with terror and trembling that she herself was unaware of. She was held tightly in the man&#x27;s arms. Her cheek pressed against his warm chest, listening to his steady and powerful heartbeat.</p>
<p>That shameless scoundrel who had just fought with him and nearly made him lose his temper was now like a mountain, protecting him tightly behind his back. He used his flesh and blood to withstand a fatal blow that was powerful enough to pierce through the defenses of a fifth tier star beast. Why? Why did he save himself? I just looked down on him and called him shameless. That mad man. Time seemed to slow down infinitely at this moment.</p>
<p>Those two poison daggers seemed to grow infinitely larger in Mu Wan Binging beautiful eyes filled with fear and confusion. Just as the tip of the dagger was about to pierce Shin Yuan&#x27;s back, a sudden change has occurred. The ancient jade pendant inside Shun Yuans clothes, which was personally given to him by ElderQ and engraved with a dragon pattern, suddenly burst out with an extremely dazzling golden light. A scorching heat through the fabric burned onto Mu Wanings cheek. Roar Dash, a dragon&#x27;s roar, originating from the primordial era and carrying supreme majesty, resounded deep within everyone&#x27;s soul.</p>
<p>A solid golden dragon-shaped phantom roared out from the jade pendant, instantly forming a semi-transparent golden shield that firmly protected Shin Yuan and Mu Wan Bang Clang. A crisp metallic clang rang out. The two poisoned daggers imbued with the peak cultivation of a fifth level grandmaster, shattered like fragile glass the moment they touched the golden shield, turning into countless points of light. Not even a ripple was stirred. The assassin, disguised as a female assistant, froze on his face, his sinister smile of certain victory gone.</p>
<p>It transformed into a terror and horror that came from the depths of one&#x27;s soul. What kind of power is this? Martial arts will. Moreover, it is a top tier marshall will that has been condensed to the extreme and has even begun to touch upon the level of laws. This is at least the work of a martial god at the ninth realm, half marshall god. How could a mere fourthlevel grand marshall master possibly possess such a powerful protective treasure? The intelligence is incorrect.</p>
<p>This is a trap, a deadly trap specifically designed for these spies. The female assassin&#x27;s heart sank to the bottom, and she turned to run away. Something even more terrifying happened. Within the golden dragon shadow coiled behind Shin Yuan, a blurry yet towering, aged figure materialized. His face was indistinct, but the oppressive aura emanating from him, which was as longasting as heaven and earth, and as radiant as the sun and moon, froze the entire space.</p>
<p>Those murky yet penetrating eyes glanced indifferently at the female assassin who was about to flee. Then he extended a thin, dry finger. He lightly tapped the air in the direction of the assassin. There was no loud noise, no energy fluctuation. It was just a casual gesture like shoeing away a fly with a single finger.</p>
<p>In an instant, that top assassin at the peak of the fifth realm Grandmaster, her body was like a sand sculpture that had been weathered for thousands of years, turning into the finest gray white powder inch by inch, starting from her feet, gone with the wind. Not a single trace of blood was left. One finger can instantly kill a peak fifth realm cultivator. What incredible divine power this is. Outside the office, the assassin, disguised as a security guard, was terrified the moment he saw this scene.</p>
<p>In order to survive, he decisively abandoned this almost impossible task and resolutely burned his essence and vital energy, turning into a streak of blood red light, trying to escape through the window. The aged figure standing in the void didn&#x27;t even bother to glance at him. He merely let out a cold, indifferent snort from his throat. Snort. Words become law.</p>
<p>The assassin had already rushed to the window. Under the horrified gaze of the female bodyguard from the six realms, his body, like his companions, turned into dust and ashes. The terrifying pressure came quickly and went quickly. The golden light faded. The dragon&#x27;s shadow vanished, and the aged figure disappeared as well.</p>
<p>The huge CEO&#x27;s office fell into a deathly silence. Only the intertwined heartbeats of Shun Yuan and Mu Wan Bing remained in the air. Shin Yuan still held her tightly, his strong arms not loosening in the slightest. Mu Waminging body had already gone limp. She leaned against the man&#x27;s chest, her mind blank.</p>
<p>Chapter 114. The intelligent life formed Starbara. In the headset, Su Ching Xus voice for the first time lost its usual languidness and playfulness, becoming unusually serious. Shinuan, are you crazy? Don&#x27;t be so reckless next time. The dragon soul jade pinned contains Elderqin&#x27;s marshall will.</p>
<p>Each use weakens it by one point. Your life is more precious than a hundred Mu wandings. Hearing Su Ching Xus exclamation, Shinuan felt a wave of fear wash over him. He glanced down at the icy beauty in his arms, who was still in a state of extreme shock and hadn&#x27;t come to her senses yet, and couldn&#x27;t help but mentally complain. Damn it, this woman is truly a fem fatal.</p>
<p>Even discussing business with her can attract two assassins at the peak of the fifth realm. If I were to actually marry her, I&#x27;d probably be living a life of constant danger and conflict. But he felt the perfect delicate body in his arms, trembling slightly, but not breaking down and screaming, and smelled her unique, cool, and alluring fragrance. Faced with an assassination attempt of this caliber, the woman&#x27;s body merely stiffened, and her breathing only became slightly more rapid. It seems this isn&#x27;t the first time she&#x27;s faced such a horrific assassination attempt.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan released the icy beauty who was still in a daysaze from his arms. Mr. Mu, are you all right? He looked at her and couldn&#x27;t help but ask. Muan Bing was startled awake by his voice. She staggered and leaned against the cold wall before she could barely stand.</p>
<p>She looked at the two piles of ashes on the ground, no longer recognizable as human figures, and felt a lingering fear. At this moment, the female bodyguard at the sixth realm finally reacted and rushed in. When she saw this strange scene in the office and Mu Wanings pale face, she felt extremely ashamed and fearful. Mr. Mu, I have failed in my duty.</p>
<p>Please punish me. She knelt on one knee, blaming herself and asking for punishment. Muan Bing simply waved her hand weakly to stop her. His gaze filled with complex emotions fell upon Shinuan. This man, whom she had just despised and even called a scumbag and a shameless scoundrel, shielded her with his body at the most crucial moment without a second&#x27;s hesitation.</p>
<p>In that instant, it felt as if her frozen heart had been gripped by a large burning hand. The man who betrayed her for power and beauty, and the man before her, who selflessly saved her without hesitation. Two figures crossed her mind, the contrast so stark, so ironic. The terrifying power emanating from the small jade pendant on his body enough to instantly kill someone at the peak of the fifth realm shocked and intrigued her. Who exactly is this man? Why would there be such a powerful protective treasure? Just as she was feeling extremely confused, she suddenly noticed that Shun Yuan was staring intently at her face without blinking.</p>
<p>The look in his eyes didn&#x27;t seem like he was looking at someone who had just gone through a life or death experience. It was more like he was admiring a rare treasure. Shinuan was indeed looking, but not at her face. He was looking at the system panel that popped up on her face. Target: Muan Bing, age 30.</p>
<p>Talent: Business Genius: Gradea A. Realm: None. Appearance rating 99. Peerless beauty. Body rating 96.</p>
<p>Golden ratio abstinence type perfection. Status single innocent. Overall rating 98. God tier. Ding.</p>
<p>A god tier target with a score of 98 or higher has been detected. Special strategy mission issued. Melting iceberg. Mission objective. Achieve a 90% heart rate with the target Muan Bing and win good luck.</p>
<p>Personal reward. Obtain the cosmic treasure. Intelligent life starbala. Another godle player. Another 98 points.</p>
<p>Shin yuan&#x27;s heart pounded wildly. His gaze fixed on the reward. The intelligent life form starbala. He immediately clicked on the detailed introduction. The intelligent life form starbara originating from the core legacy of the ancient technological civilization at in the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p>This civilization once dominated a star system but was destroyed in a war against the Zerg. Starbara is one of the few surviving remnants of its civilization. She possesses a portion of AT&#x27;s technological database, cultivation system, and the ability to assist her master in ultra- high precision calculations and combat simulations. What Shin Yuan was utterly shocked. A legacy of a civilization.</p>
<p>The value of this reward is beyond words. This is even more exaggerated than the dragon blood tempering pool. Muan Bing noticed that Shun Yuan was staring at her face with increasing intensity in his gaze, making her very uncomfortable. Her fair ears unconsciously flushed slightly. She looked at Shin Yuan, opened her mouth, and said, &quot;Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I owe you a favor.&quot; This was the first time in her entire life that Muan Bing had ever said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; or &quot;I owe you a favor to a man.&quot; Shin Yuans next words, however, caused her emotions, which had just calmed down, to fluctuate again. Is a simple thank you all it takes? Shin Yuan snapped out of his days, grinned, stepped forward, and leaned close to Mu Wan Bings face. Then he pointed to his chest, and said incredulously, &quot;Mr. Moo, I took this for you.</p>
<p>Even though it didn&#x27;t block anything, the thought was there, wasn&#x27;t it? Look at my heart. Still pounding for you. It&#x27;s still not quite over yet.&quot; Having just survived an assassination attempt, Shinuan was still trying to claim credit. Mu Wan Binging pale face couldn&#x27;t hold back any longer, and an unnatural blush appeared. But after all, he had just been prepared to risk his life to save her without any hesitation.</p>
<p>This shameless, even somewhat frivolous way of taking credit made her feel angry, inexplicably, and also a little amused. It seems that a crack has indeed appeared in that heart that has been frozen for many years. Whether in the past or now, she has always relied solely on herself, always being the one who has given the most. But now, a man is risking his life to protect her. It would be a lie to say I wasn&#x27;t even a little bit tempted.</p>
<p>If it were my past self after experiencing this scene, I might have actually fallen in love with him. She didn&#x27;t know how to repay this profound kindness. He had no choice but to take out a black card with the words God branded in pure gold from his expensive limited edition handbag and hand it to Shinuan. There are 50 billion in this. Consider this payment.</p>
<p>Having experienced so much, she believes that there is nothing in this world that money cannot solve. If so, it means there isn&#x27;t enough money. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t even glance at the black gold card that could drive anyone crazy and simply pushed it back. He shook his head, his smile becoming meaningful. Mr.</p>
<p>Mu, you&#x27;ve made a mistake again. I have no interest in money. If you really want to repay me, why don&#x27;t you? He paused, looked into Mu Wan Bings beautiful eyes filled with doubt and weariness, and then made a condition that she had not expected. Will you grant me a small request? What are the requirements? Mu Wan being frowned. a sense of vigilance rising in her heart.</p>
<p>She didn&#x27;t believe that this glib tonged, scheming man would make any serious requests. Could it be that she wants me to marry her? The moment the thought popped into her head, she nipped it in the bud. Impossible. Absolutely impossible. How could I have such an absurd thought about him? Chapter 115.</p>
<p>The female CEO sprained her ankle. What a great opportunity. Just as she was lost in thought, Shinuan spoke up. His smile was so nonchalant, but what he said stunned Muan Bing on the spot. My requirements are very simple.</p>
<p>From today until the Dragon Blood Tempering Pool project is fully completed, you muan Bing must remain at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters as the chief technical director of this project to personally oversee its progress. And during this period, you must be available at any time on call 24 hours a day and unconditionally cooperate with all my work arrangements as your special technical adviser. What do you mean? Mu Wamings face turned cold. Why would she, the president of a multinational corporation with trillions of assets, condescend to be his technical director, and they also have to be on call 24/7 to cooperate with his work as an adviser? Am I not clear enough? Shin Yuan&#x27;s gaze swept over the two inconspicuous puddles of ashes on the ground, and his tone became a bit more serious. Today&#x27;s assassination attempt has proven that you, the president of Tian Shin Industries, have become a thorn in the side of some people.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans words were like a needle, precisely piercing the most taught string in Mu Wan Bings heart. A flicker of emotion crossed her cold, beautiful eyes. Indeed, in the past 6 months, there have been no fewer than five attacks and accidents targeting her, each more dangerous than the last. The old guys on the board of directors have hinted to her more than once to be careful, implying that they are afraid that if something happens to her, the backbone of the company, it will affect the stock price of Tianin Industrial. She never imagined that the other party would actually use two grand masters of the fifth realm to assassinate her on the top floor of the heavenly god industrial branch building.</p>
<p>Do you think that with the strength of your sixth realm marshall king bodyguard, he can guarantee your safety 100%. Today, only a peak fifth realm warrior has arrived. What about next time? Could it be a sixthrem warrior or even a seventh realm war emperor? With each word Shin Yuan spoke, Mu Wandings face grew paler. The female bodyguard from the sixth realm, who was kneeling on one knee at the door, lowered her head in shame, her back soaked with cold sweat. Seeing her everchanging expression, Shin Yuan continued to increase the stakes.</p>
<p>Staying at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters is currently the safest option for you. Moreover, the Dragon Blood Tempering Pool Project cannot afford the slightest mistake. With you, the president of Tianin Industries personally overseeing it, our company feels even more at ease. The most important thing is, aren&#x27;t you very interested in that pool? Staying at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters gives you plenty of opportunities. You can take advantage of your proximity, right? These last words struck Mu Wan Bings weak spot precisely.</p>
<p>She is a businesswoman, an extremely shrewd businesswoman who always pursues the maximization of profits. She was well aware of the strategic value of the dragon blood tempering pool. If she could be the first to experience its amazing effects, it could bring immeasurable benefits to her and the entire celestial industries. Risk and opportunity always coexist. After a brief deliberation, Muan Bing made a calm and decisive judgment.</p>
<p>Good. I promise you, starting tomorrow, I will be moving into the Umbrella Corporation headquarters. During the project, all my actions will be in accordance with your instructions as the technical adviser. With the matter settled, Muan Bing didn&#x27;t want to stay in this place that made her uneasy for even a moment longer. The sixth realm female bodyguard named Shiaoing was currently guarding Muan Bings side with a vigilant expression, her sharp eyes scanning every inch of the surrounding space, fearing that another assassin might appear.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the private elevator leading from the top floor CEO&#x27;s office to the underground parking garage was terrifyingly oppressive. Muan Bing leaned against the cold staircase wall, her mind a jumbled mess. Everything that happened today completely overturned her understanding of the past 26 years. The elevator doors opened and a stretched black phantom hover car was quietly parked above its designated parking space. Perhaps it was because she had just experienced a life or death moment and was suddenly relaxed after being under immense tension.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was because the custommade 10 cm high heels on her feet were really torturous. But the moment Mu Wan Bing stepped out of the elevator, her legs went weak and her body swayed uncontrollably. That subtle movement did not escape Shinuan&#x27;s eyes. Mr. Mu, watch your step.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t injure yourself before you even get to the company. Before Muan Bing could even glare at him with her icy gaze, Shin Yuan had already taken a step forward and with a short gasp from her swept her up in his arms. You The sudden feeling of weightlessness and the man&#x27;s hot masculine aura completely stunned Mu Wan Bing, leaving her mind blank and forgetting even to struggle. Upon seeing this, Shiaoing, the female bodyguard from the sixth realm, instinctively wanted to step forward, but was stopped by a look from Shin Yuan. What are you looking at? Your CEO sprained his ankle.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t you going to get the car? Shiaoing opened her mouth, looked at her boss&#x27;s slightly red face, and finally silently turned around and walked quickly towards the elevator. The spacious and luxurious rear seats of the bulletproof limousine are large enough for two adults to lie down comfortably. But after Shinuan put Muan Bing inside, he completely ignored the empty space on the other side and sat down right next to her. Their shoulders were almost touching, and the heat emanating from the man beside her made Mu Wan Bing feel uncomfortable all over. Even though there was a huge space on the other side that could fit two people lying down, he insisted on squeezing in here.</p>
<p>Mu Wan Bing frowned, about to reprimand him. Shin Yuan&#x27;s gaze fell on her ankle, which was clad in fleshcoled stockings and was slightly swollen and red. &quot;Did you sprain your ankle?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s none of your business,&quot; Muan said coldly, trying to pull her foot back. That won&#x27;t do, Shinyuan said. Seriously.</p>
<p>If the chief technology officer becomes incapacitated and delays the project, I can&#x27;t bear the responsibility. Before he finished speaking, he had already reached out and grabbed her slender ankle. What are you doing? Let go. Don&#x27;t move. I&#x27;ll rub it for you.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be fine soon. Shinuan didn&#x27;t even look at her. With his other hand, he skillfully pinched the heel of her expensive custom-made high heels, and with a gentle force, he took them off and casually tossed them aside. Muan Bing froze completely. Before Muan Bing could react, his fingers had already hooked the edge of the stockings and pulled them down.</p>
<p>The smooth silk fabric slipped off her smooth calves, revealing her meticulously cared for, flawless skin. Mu Wan Bings cheeks were burning hot, and even her neck was flushed with a beautiful pink. You&#x27;re shameless. Shinyuan seemed not to hear and exerted a slight force. The calloused thumb pressed precisely on the swollen acupoint on her ankle, kneading it with just the right amount of pressure.</p>
<p>His a strange sensation of soreness, numbness, swelling, and pain washed over Muan Bing, causing her to involuntarily gasp for breath. The man&#x27;s pressure was just right. With each press, she felt the excruciating pain gradually subside. That scoundrel, that bastard. He&#x27;s clearly taking advantage of himself, but why does it feel like it&#x27;s still pretty good? She felt incredibly ashamed of the absurd thought that had popped into her head, and her mind was in turmoil.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan silently called upon the system in his heart. System: Investigate. Target: Muan Bing. Age: 30. Talent: Business Empire: Gradea A.</p>
<p>Realm. Appearance rating 99. Stunningly beautiful. Body rating 96. Golden ratio abstinence type perfection.</p>
<p>Status single innocent. Heartbeat level 55%. Curiosity weariness a slight inexplicable flutter. Overall rating 98. God tier 55 points.</p>
<p>From initial dislike to a current 55 points. All it took was an assassination attempt and a massage. It seems that this ancient iceberg is not indestructible after all. The words a strange flutter of excitement particularly lifted his spirits. The pressure on his hands softened slightly.</p>
<p>Chapter 116. A body free from cold. A soul warm from fiery flames. Who is she? She is the president of Tianin Industrial. The eldest daughter of the Moo family and a queen who stands at the top of a business empire and looks down on the world.</p>
<p>From childhood to adulthood, let alone being held by a man like this. Even a normal handshake felt like an offense to her. Let go. Mu Wan Bing gritted her teeth. But the voice that came out was soft and gentle without any trace of her usual majesty.</p>
<p>More like the coetishness between lovers. Shinuan&#x27;s hands did not stop moving at all. My heart was filled with joy. Ice queens are all the same. They say no, but their bodies tell a different story.</p>
<p>However, the smirk on his face quickly disappeared. He keenly sensed that something was a miss. It&#x27;s too cold. Even though the car&#x27;s climate control system was set just right, the temperature emanating from Mu Wanings skin was abnormally cold, it wasn&#x27;t the kind of cold that ordinary girls have, but a kind of chill that came from the depths of his bones, almost freezing his palms. A wisp of white, almost invisible cold air was emanating from the soles of her feet.</p>
<p>Something strange. Shin Yuan felt a chill run down his spine and immediately began to silently recite the mantra in his mind. system in death investigation. Ding. Deep gene scan is being performed on target Muan Bing.</p>
<p>Scan complete. The next second, Muan Bing&#x27;s dazzling 98 point godle level panel reappeared in Shiny Yuan&#x27;s mind. At the very bottom of that panel, a line of ominous negative status markers in scarlet font made his pupils shrink. Physique body of a thousand cold SSS grade not activated. Current status extremely dangerous due to the chill affecting the heart.</p>
<p>Status explanation. Due to unknown reasons, the target possesses an innate trace of extreme cold within their body. If this constitution can be awakened, they can control the coldest power in the world, possessing limitless potential. However, if they cannot awaken it, the cold will accumulate and intensify each year. On the last day of each month, the cold within the body will completely erupt, causing an unbearable pain, as if falling into an icy abyss with meridians ruptured and allergies excruciating and rendering them unable to use any vital energy.</p>
<p>Only the most powerful and young energy or an extremely young treasure of the same level can temporarily suppress and alleviate the condition. Warning: The cold energy in the target&#x27;s body has accumulated to a critical point. If it is not cleared away, the target may explode and die at any time. What? A body resistant to a thousand cold spells and its SS level. Shinuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>No wonder this woman was as cold as an ice block. It turns out she really was cold. Moreover, this problem sounds even less reliable than his frank talent. If things go well, it could be an SSS level divine body. If things go wrong, it could be a ticking time bomb that could freeze itself to death at any moment.</p>
<p>Looking at the description of the last day of the month when the cold air erupts and the pain is unbearable, Shun Yuan immediately understood. Isn&#x27;t this just a female version of menstruation? It&#x27;s still once a month, but this time it&#x27;s an incredibly powerful, life-threatening version. He looked at Mu Wan Bings beautiful face, which was filled with shame and anger because of his offense. Yet, she was also enduring the pleasure in her ankle. The power of ultimate yang and ultimate strength.</p>
<p>This SSRA undying flame soul that I just acquired is practically a given. It&#x27;s like meat delivered right to my mouth by God. Thinking of this, Shinuan&#x27;s gaze towards Mu Wan Bing became intense. It was no longer just teasing and taking advantage, but like an experienced traditional Chinese medicine doctor seeing a terminally ill patient who could be cured by his medicine. It seems Mr.</p>
<p>Mu is really afraid of the cold. His feet are as cold as ice. Shun Yuan spoke casually while secretly activating the crimson flame in his dantion which resembled a miniature sun. A faint yet intensely hot vital energy carrying the essence of pure life slowly entered the Yong Kuan acupoint. This power is none other than his newly awakened undying flame soul.</p>
<p>Um a warm current like the winter sun flowed from the soles of her feet up her limbs. Mu winging trembled all over. The bone chilling cold that had tormented her for years like a persistent carbuncle was actually dispelled by this warm current. Although it was only a sliver, it was to her no less than seeing a ray of dawn in endless darkness. Incredulous astonishment flashed in her cold, sharp, beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Who exactly is this man? How could he possess such pure and vigorous masculine energy? This power is 10 times more effective than those so-called Supreme Yong treasures that she spend a fortune to find. But this warmth is too weak. It&#x27;s like someone who&#x27;s about to die of thirst only drinking a drop of water, which doesn&#x27;t quench their thirst at all. Not enough. Not nearly enough.</p>
<p>She wants more. Shin Yuan took in the subtle changes in her expression and felt increasingly smug. It seems my treatment plan is working well. At the same time, he increased the output of the undying flame. Soulchi.</p>
<p>Chapter 117. Mu wanding. In the driver&#x27;s seat, the sixthrem female bodyguard named Shiaoing had just witnessed this scene through the rear view mirror. She was completely stunned. What did she see? Her own aloof, cold-blooded CEO, who despised all men and would even wash his hands three times before shaking hands with one, was now acting like a cat that had been petted comfortably.</p>
<p>Shiaoing&#x27;s worldview has collapsed. A thought popped into her head that she found utterly absurd. The CEO actually has this kind of fetish, and judging from her expression, she seems to be enjoying it. No wonder she never lets any man get close to her. It turns out she just hasn&#x27;t met anyone with such good technique.</p>
<p>The way Shiaoing looked at Shinuan. From initial weariness and hostility, it turned into heartfelt admiration. She risked her life to save her master and could also precisely satisfy the president&#x27;s unknown special fetishes. He&#x27;s truly a genius. She immediately focused her attention and switched the hover cars driving mode to the highest level of stability.</p>
<p>They were afraid that even the slightest bump would disturb the president&#x27;s enjoyment in the back seat. Upon hearing Mu Wanings soft moan, Shinuan knew that the hardest outer shell of this iceberg had been cracked open by the undying flame soul within his body. A body resistant to extreme cold VS, an indestructible fiery spirit plus nourished by dragon energy. He felt much more confident and his actions became even more unrestrained. The fiery energy is everpresent.</p>
<p>Wherever it passed, the cold air melted away. Mu Wan Binging rationality crumbled in the face of ultimate comfort. This damned cold body has tormented her for 12 whole years. Ever since that heartbreak when she was 18, this chill had taken rooe in her body, and it had been getting worse every year. She tried countless rare and precious herbs, visited numerous renowned doctors, and even the empire&#x27;s top life scientists were helpless against her strange illness.</p>
<p>But now, this scoundrel in front of her, this scumbag she despised, actually gave her a sense of hope for healing in just a few short minutes. She followed her heart and gave up resisting. Only one thought remained in her mind. As long as this damned cold can be dispelled, he can do whatever he wants. Seeing that she was lying flat, Shinuan no longer restrained himself.</p>
<p>He directly increased the power of the undying flame soul to 30%. If what was just a stream was now a scalding lava, the scorching energy surged into her meridians, which had long been frozen by the cold, washing away and burning them. As if she had been thrown into a volcanic hot spring, Muam Bing was almost melted by the extreme heat. The hover car stopped at the exclusive entrance to the underground base of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters. The car door slid open silently, and Li Yun, Xiao, Jingua, and Su Ching Zhu were already waiting there.</p>
<p>They were there to welcome this god of wealth, who is also an important future partner. But when they saw what was inside the car, all three of them froze on the spot. In the spacious and luxurious back seat, Muan Bing, the legendary ice queen CEO, who was said to be colder than 10,000 years of ice, had a blush on her pretty face. Her impossibly long legs, meticulously crossed and encased in fleshcoled stockings, now had one high heel missing, and the stocking on the other foot had been pulled down to her ankle. Her exposed jade feet were as white as frost and snow with red marks criss-crossing on them, resembling vivid wounds cut into ice.</p>
<p>Cold and beautiful, yet with a touch of brokenness. Holy crap. Upon witnessing this scene, Ziao Xingwa, a master of the fifth realm, immediately uttered a phrase about the essence of Chinese culture. He rubbed his eyes. What&#x27;s going on here? Ziaoin was sighed with awe.</p>
<p>This guy really sacrificed himself for the company. Hearing her husband&#x27;s lewd words, Li Yun blushed and pinched his waist hard in annoyance. But she couldn&#x27;t help but be curious. If Muan Bing could exhaust her leerous husband, Shinuan like this, is she even more formidable than that female demon, Su Chingu? Only Su Chingu pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and the beautiful eyes behind the lenses sparkled with the brilliance of a scientist discovering a new continent. Interestingly, it seems that fatigue is also a very effective way to break down psychological defenses.</p>
<p>Another item has been added to the sample data. Inside the car, Mu Waming finally recovered a little from the extreme shame and indignation. She quickly took off the stocking from her other foot, crumpled the two stockings into a ball, and threw them into the farthest corner of the carriage. He decisively discarded the humiliation he had just suffered. &quot;Mr.</p>
<p>Mu, we&#x27;ve arrived.&quot; Shin Yuan suppressed the laugh and pretended to get out of the car. As soon as Mu Wan being moved, she found that her legs were sore and weak that she could not even stand up. She staggered and almost fell to the ground. The next second, a pair of strong hands pulled her into their arms again. &quot;The physical therapy seems to be working well, right?&quot; Shinuan whispered with a smile in her ear.</p>
<p>&quot;The only problem is that the after effects might be quite significant.&quot; After saying that, he ignored Mu Wan Bings struggles which were filled with shame and indignation and half carried half helped her out of the car. Chapter 118. Yet another invitation from the scientists. Mr. Mu, welcome to Umbrella Corporation.</p>
<p>Li Yun greeted them with a warm smile. She glanced at Mu Wan Bing, who was being supported by Shin Yuan, her steps unsteady, her pretty face slightly flushed, and then at Shin Yuan beside her, who was panting heavily from exhaustion. The fire of gossip in her heart burned fiercely. Not bad, this kid. Hello, Master Li Yun.</p>
<p>Muan Bing tried to remain calm and broke free from Shun Yuan&#x27;s embrace, but found that the man&#x27;s arm did not move at all. For the time being, he was left half carrying her, and under the admiring and knowing gazes of a group of company warriors, they walked into the base. Along the way, every martial artist who saw Shun Yuan spontaneously stood at attention and gave him a perfect salute. That look was no longer just respect, but a fanatical, almost religious worship. Salute.</p>
<p>The slogans, as loud as a mountain and as powerful as a tsunami, echoed through the wide underground passage. The most elite warriors of these protection companies looked at Shin Yuan with a heartfelt and pure respect that was untainted by any self-interest. She suddenly understood what was burning in Shinuan&#x27;s eyes when he said those words in the office yesterday. That&#x27;s faith. compared to her ex-boyfriend who would betray the empire and herself without hesitation for personal gain.</p>
<p>This scoundrel, this scumbag, this bastard who just took a huge advantage of me. Like, it&#x27;s not so bad anymore. Lie Yun and Xiao Jing Wo warmly settled Mu Wan Bing into the base&#x27;s second highest level fortress, which also had the second highest security level. As soon as Muan Bing entered the room, she immediately pushed Shinuan out and slammed the door shut. She leaned against the cold door, listening to her own unsteady heartbeat, her mind a complete mess.</p>
<p>She walked to the huge floor toseeiling window, looking out the window at the city protected by steel and artillery. I looked down at my feet, which were now red and swollen, but had subsided. A strange emotion quietly sprouted in her heart, which had been frozen for many years. Outside the door, Shin Yuan was just about to return to his fortress to get some rest. After all, an even more challenging academic seminar awaited him tonight.</p>
<p>Suuchin Xu, that female demon, is not someone a novice like Mu Wan Bing can compare to. As soon as he turned around, Su Chingu blocked his way. She was still wearing that spotless white lab coat and her signature gold rimmed glasses. She walked around Shin Yuan as if examining a rare experimental sample that had just been collected from the wild. He asked with a smile, &quot;Sure, consultant Shin, your scope of business is quite broad.</p>
<p>Now, I not only have to do manual labor, but I also have to work part-time as a foot massage technician. What? Do you have some special obsession with foot massages? Su Ching Xus words, though seemingly a joke, were subtly tinged with a hint of sourness that only a woman could detect. Nonsense. Don&#x27;t slander someone&#x27;s innocence out of thin air. Shinuan immediately stiffened his neck and retorted loudly.</p>
<p>I was treating and saving lives. Don&#x27;t you understand? Oh, to treat the sick and save lives. Suching smile became even more playful. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, and her beautiful eyes behind the lenses gleamed with a cunning light. How come I didn&#x27;t know that you men treat illnesses starting from the feet? And if you&#x27;re going to treat someone, why did the car suddenly go silent during treatment? I was using extra sensory listening devices to monitor everything that was happening in your car the whole time.</p>
<p>She leaned close to Shun Yuan&#x27;s ear, her voice carrying a devilish allure. Are you kidding me? One sentence directly exposed Shun Yuan&#x27;s pathetic, self-deceiving pretense. He was rendered speechless by the rebuttal. He couldn&#x27;t very well say that he had actually used the undying flame soul to help Mu Wuan Bing suppress the cold energy in her body, could he? That devilish Su Chingu would never believe it. She would only feel that she was making up a high- sounding excuse for her perverted behavior.</p>
<p>Seeing Shun Yuans embarrassed and frustrated appearance, Su Chingu suddenly couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. But she also knew that everything should be done in moderation. Even a rabbit will bite when cornered. Moreover, this is no docel little rabbit. Just as Shin Yuan was getting angry and embarrassed and was about to give up and do whatever he wanted, Su Chingu suddenly changed the subject and the smile on her face became meaningful.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;m not teasing you anymore. She stretched out her slender, fair fingers and gently touched Shuan&#x27;s firm chest. Considering how much you&#x27;ve sacrificed for the company&#x27;s groundbreaking efforts today, I&#x27;m giving you a break. Tonight, I, as your support staff, will personally step in to help you replenish all the energy you&#x27;ve expended. Shin Yuan was taken aback by her sudden gentleness.</p>
<p>Before he could react, Su Ching Xus next words made his scalp tingle again. But before that, shouldn&#x27;t we first have a more in-depth academic seminar? She looked at Shun Yuan, and her beautiful eyes revealed a longing for a strong person. I&#x27;m very curious about just how strong your icebreaking skills are. Looking at her eager expression, Shinuan felt as if he were not talking to a scientist, but rather giving a pre- battle pep talk to a female warrior about to go to the battlefield. A man&#x27;s pride prevents him from backing down, especially in this situation where the other party has already blatantly provoked us.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stepped forward. Under Su Ching Xus slightly surprised gaze, he pressed her against the cold wall. A perfect wall slam that couldn&#x27;t be more standard. Would you like to try my treatment method, Dr. Sue, compared to that stubborn iceberg? I&#x27;m actually more interested in you.</p>
<p>This human nuclear weapon completely sealed away in your white coat. I just don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re willing to make some big sacrifices. I&#x27;ve been waiting for you to say those words for a long time. She couldn&#x27;t suppress her excitement and temptation. My body also harbors many ailments that even I cannot unravel.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just waiting for you to come and help me cure each and every one of these ailments. After saying that, she nimly emerged from under Shun Yuan&#x27;s strong arm. As nimble as a boneless, beautiful snake, she straightened her white lab coat, which was slightly disheveled from her earlier movements, turned around, and stroed towards her laboratory with her incredibly long legs and red high heels. All that remained was a swaying, alluring silhouette, and an invitation that ignited Shun Yuan&#x27;s passion. My lab at 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>tonight. I have prepared a very special academic seminar for you. I hope you can provide enough support for us to complete the entire research project. If late, only Shin Yuan could understand the sinister threat. In her words, you will be responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>As Shin Yuan watched her perfect figure disappear at the end of the corridor, he felt his blood boiling. Just when one patient is cured, another one arrives, waiting to be studied. And judging from her tone, tonight&#x27;s seminar might not last until dawn. Chapter 119. scientists fail, becoming lab rats and prisoners of war.</p>
<p>Inside fortress number one, he was stunned when he pushed open the door. In the spacious living room, Lyu was already waiting there. The outfit that made her feel neglected in the restaurant, a black bodycon miniskirt and ultra thin black stockings, was her battles suit. She didn&#x27;t sit. She just stood quietly in the center of the living room like a perfect black sculpture exuding a cold aura.</p>
<p>As soon as Shun Yuan entered, her cold and sharp eyes locked onto him. We should make up for all the training we did these past few days. You promised me last time. Looking into her longing and stubborn eyes, Shinuan thought about tonight at 8:00 about that female demon Sue Ching Zhu and that academic seminar that was destined to be fatal. My head is buzzing.</p>
<p>On one side is a stunningly beautiful long-legged S-class woman who has already taken the bait and is ready to be caught at any time. On the other side is a G-class human nuclear weapon scientist who has just completed a mission and is filled with a fervent interest in his own research. This  should we work overtime first or should we hold a discussion first? Ultimately, reason or rather the desire for a greater reward prevailed over impulse. Shinuan made the most difficult yet wisest decision to win over Sue Chingu first. There was no way around it.</p>
<p>The random S-rank bloodline awakening on her quest panel was just too tempting. This thing is his ultimate trump card that can bring about another qualitative change in his strength, allowing him to dominate the upcoming battle of geniuses. As for Lung Yus side, she&#x27;ll just have to put up with this for now. Ahem um instructor Lyu looking at L Yus icy pretty face that seemed to say, &quot;Try refusing me if you dare and her disappointed and unwilling eyes,&quot; Shin Yuan felt a chill run down his spine. He stealed himself, stepped forward, and made an empty promise to her in an extremely sincere tone.</p>
<p>You see, it is indeed a bit late today. I just finished discussing a big project worth hundreds of millions with Muan Bing, and I am exhausted both physically and mentally. How about this tomorrow? I&#x27;ll definitely make it up to you double tomorrow. I&#x27;ll make sure you&#x27;re wellfed and help you break through your limits. Lung Yu stared at him calmly, her eyes filled with utter disbelief.</p>
<p>But she also knew that forced relationships are never happy. Since this man is already distracted, even if I force him to stay, I won&#x27;t achieve the best cultivation results. She could only snort coldly, suppressing all the resentment and grievances in her heart. She left Shinuan&#x27;s room wearing those stiletto heels. Her figure, swaying in the tight short skirt, seemed to carry a hint of defiance.</p>
<p>Looking at her lonely and flororn figure, Shin Yuan felt a pang of guilt. Oh, what a sin. What a sin. He shook his head and silently swore an oath in his heart. Once I&#x27;ve won over Su Chinghu and awakened my S-rank bloodline, I&#x27;ll definitely make it up to this long-legged mature woman I&#x27;ve neglected.</p>
<p>At 8:00 p.m. sharp, Shinuan arrived at Su Chings private laboratory. The moment he pushed open that heavy alloy door, the sight before him made him feel his blood rushed to his head. In the laboratory, the lights were dimmed to an ambiguous pink. The various cold, high precision instruments continued to operate silently, but under this ambiguous light, they added an inexplicable sense of taboo.</p>
<p>Such had already taken off her signature white coat. She changed into a very provocative white angel outfit. Beneath the skirt, which was so short it barely reached her upper thighs, were a pair of incredibly voluuptuous and shapely legs encased in pure white suspender stockings. On her feet were a pair of bright red stiletto heels that contrasted sharply with the white angel outfit she wore. The most deadly thing was that she was holding a huge syringe thicker than Shin Yuan&#x27;s arm filled with an unknown pale golden liquid.</p>
<p>She leaned against the cold operating table in the center of the room, a table specifically used for human experiments, and gave Shin Yuan a kind yet incredibly cunning smile as he stared in disbelief. &quot;Patient, you are 3 minutes late.&quot; She spoke in a commanding tone. &quot;Now immediately lie down on this operating table. Our clinical trial will begin immediately.&quot; The stunning scene, the fiery outfit, the queen-like commanding tone. Shin Yuan walked to the operating table, looked into Su Ching Xus beautiful eyes filled with a desire for research and exploration and revealed a wicked smile.</p>
<p>He snatched the huge syringe from her hand, and tossed it aside. Under Su Ching Xu slightly surprised gaze. He lifted her up from the cold operating table. He did not go to the soft, comfortable bed. He walked to the other side of the operating table and knelt down on one knee.</p>
<p>He looked up at her and smiled. Before administering the injection, the doctor followed the standard treatment procedure. Shouldn&#x27;t I, as your caregiver, give you a full physical examination first? Su Chingu looked at his focused yet malicious eyes, at his practiced movements that even made her heart tremble. And then she thought of what he had done to Mu Wan Bing in the car during the day. Her heart was racing.</p>
<p>Body temperature is rising. But at that moment, the personal terminal on her wrist started flashing red. A heart rate of 120 beats per minute and a 1.2° C increase in body surface temperature are interesting. There is a strong positive correlation between stimulation of the neural plexus and dopamine secretion. She looked at the constantly fluctuating physiological data on the screen and that damned thirst for knowledge that belongs to scientists once again overcame her reason.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shinuan felt that he was being used as an experimental subject once again. They pulled Su Ching Xu, who was still looking at the data and muttering to herself off the operating table. Looking up at her, he smiled. Dr. Sue, for the sake of data accuracy and experimental rigor, as the researcher yourself, shouldn&#x27;t you also personally participate in this experiment? Su Chingu attempted to use her S-level genetic insight to analyze every sensory change and record every energy fluctuation.</p>
<p>Despite the intense struggle of the lab rat, she rationally tried to dissuade it. The outcome was destined to be a failure. Chapter 1, 12. The Dragon&#x27;s Fury. At the same time, Fortress number two.</p>
<p>Muam Bing had just finished showering and was wearing only a large bathrobe. She was leaning against the headboard, holding a financial statement for Tion Industries for the next quarter, trying to numb her chaotic nerves with work. That&#x27;s very strange. She simply couldn&#x27;t concentrate on looking at the reports. In her mind, the scene from earlier that day in the car, a scene so shameful it made her want to die, began to replay.</p>
<p>She, the president of Tianin Industry, was actually manipulated by a man. humiliation, anger, but she subconsciously touched her still warm ankle. That warmth, which melted away the chill in her body and gave her the first normal body temperature she had felt in over 20 years, was something she could never forget. Just as she was in a state of utter confusion, that familiar, excruciatingly cold aura, which caused her unbearable pain, once again seeped out from her limbs and bones like a maggot clinging to her bones. She needs more treatment.</p>
<p>A thought that made her feel ashamed and crazy began to grow in her mind. She wanted that man to do it again. But the thought that the man was currently with another woman next door. A strange sense of irritation and a sense of loss that she herself was unwilling to admit. It welled up in her heart.</p>
<p>Why is this man also a womanizing scumbag? Why? Why do I always encounter this kind of man in my life? The first one betrayed himself and the empire for power and beauty. This one, though somewhat responsible, is a bastard who falls in love with every woman he meets. Is there not a single man in this world who isn&#x27;t lustful? Frustrated, Muan being tossed the financial statements aside, got up, and walked to the large full-length mirror. The woman in the mirror wore a loosely tied bathrobe, revealing her delicate collarbone, and a small patch of snow white skin. She had an impeccable oval face, exquisite features, and a cool, aloof demeanor.</p>
<p>She examined her figure. It was perfectly proportioned with graceful curves, and her long straight legs were the envy of all others. In terms of looks and figure alone, she is confident that she is second to none. But involuntarily, the image of Su Chingu, whom he had caught a glimpse of at dusk, kept appearing in his mind. That woman, Muan Bing, looked down at her perfectly proportioned chest, then recalled Su Chings unreasonable humanpowered nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>A deep sense of frustration arose spontaneously. This isn&#x27;t even a racetrack. All of his advantages were ruthlessly crushed in the face of that ridiculously overpowered stat. G hanging. Muan Bing squeezed out the letter representing humiliation through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Feeling her rationality shatter into pieces at that moment just as she was in a state of utter confusion and almost couldn&#x27;t resist rushing next door to bang on the door. Woo woo dash. A highle alarm piercing the sky and resounding throughout the city suddenly blared. The entire Umbrella Corporation headquarters was instantly illuminated. The glaring red warning lights were flashing wildly.</p>
<p>Over the base&#x27;s public address system came Lean&#x27;s furious roar, which had become somewhat distorted due to extreme anxiety and anger. Highest alert. Highest alert. An extraordinary energy reaction has been detected in the East China Sea abyss. A catastrophic beast tide is forming.</p>
<p>It is expected to reach the coastline of East China Sea City in 30 minutes. All personnel within the company, immediately enter level one combat readiness. Repeat, all personnel, immediately enter level one combat readiness. The headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, the highest command center. The atmosphere was heavy and oppressive with a sense of impending doom permeating the air.</p>
<p>On the enormous holographic main screen, a terrifying scene resembling the end of the world is being displayed in real time. The black tsunami hundreds of meters high like a towering black wall was sweeping towards Dongai city with overwhelming force. Within those surging, boiling black waves were hundreds of millions of ferocious, enormous deep sea star beasts. At the very center of that endless beast tide, a terrifying silhouette over 10,000 meters long and covered in crimson scales like burning lava appeared and disappeared. It was the Eastern Candle Dragon, a peak eighth realm calamity level star beast that had just had a drop of its heart&#x27;s blood forcibly taken by Elder Chen and should have been severely injured and fallen into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s healed. No, it&#x27;s stronger than before. The stolen drop of heart&#x27;s blood did not weaken it. Instead, it acted like a key, unlocking some kind of shackle deep within its bloodline and plunging it into endless rage. It seeks revenge.</p>
<p>It wants to use the blood and whales of tens of millions of lives in this city to wash away the humiliation of being offended by ants. All Titan class city defense cannons immediately enter unrestricted firing mode. Throw cannonballs into that sea like they&#x27;re free stones. All aerospace fighter squadrons take off immediately. Form the first line of defense.</p>
<p>Slow down the beast tide at all costs. Notify the logistics department. Bring out all of our company&#x27;s inventory ofqi and blood enhancement potions. Distribute them immediately to every frontline martial artist. Inside the command center, a distress signal with the highest level of encryption SS was also sent at the speed of light to the capital city to the Ling Long War goddess, one of the five pillars of the human race who was stationed in the center.</p>
<p>Inside the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, alarms blared continuously. Inside the training room, dressed in a black, tight-fitting combat suit, Lung Yu held a highfrequency battleblade that exuded a chilling aura, her icy blue eyes filled with intense fighting spirit. She was the first to rush towards the elevator platform leading to the ground level city wall. Immediately afterwards, longing appeared. She too changed into a crisp military uniform and her usually cold and aloof face was filled with the determination and resolve of a warrior.</p>
<p>She was pregnant, but the powerful protection of her SS level dragon soul battle body and her terrifying strength as a grandmaster who had just broken through to the fifth realm allowed her to still possess the combat power of her peak period. She gently stroked her still not fully showing belly, and the new life force connected to her blood brought a touch of tenderness to her cold eyes that she had never shown before. &quot;Child, don&#x27;t be afraid,&quot; she murmured softly in a voice only she could hear. &quot;Your father is a jerk, but also a treasure, and your mother is a future war goddess. Today, I&#x27;ll give you a sneak peek at what true protection is.</p>
<p>Our long family&#x27;s children grow up listening to the sounds of gunfire from the womb. That&#x27;s the ultimate form of prenatal education. Meanwhile, in the laboratory that had just hosted a heated academic seminar, Shin Yuan and Su Ching Xu also rushed out from the messy operating table. When Shin Yuan saw Ling with her slightly protruding belly, rushing towards the battlefield without hesitation through the shared screen in the command center, his eyes turned red. A surge of anger and heartache exploded in his chest.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s my wife. Damn it. She&#x27;s carrying my father&#x27;s child. I&#x27;m going to, he roared, and without thinking was about to follow in Lyings footsteps and charge into the battlefield. My wife and kids are here.</p>
<p>I have to go protect them. Chapter 121 sued Ching Xus other side. Feelings heat up. Just as he was about to rush out of the laboratory, a voice came through the miniature communicator on the headpiece. Shin Yuan returned to the lab.</p>
<p>Immediately, it&#x27;s Le Yun. Shin Yuan was stunned on the spot. He looked at the screen at the fierce battlefield where the vanguard of the beast tide had already clashed with the enemy and at Ling, who was about to stand firm against the endless siege of star beasts. He spoke angrily into the communicator. Leon, what nonsense are you spouting? The beast horde is at our doorstep.</p>
<p>You wanted to go back. My pregnant wife is still out there working herself to the bone for me. You expect me to be a coward? This is an order. Over the communicator, Lie&#x27;s voice became increasingly resolute. This is a top level directive from the company.</p>
<p>Your talent, your body, there&#x27;s no room for error. Your battlefield isn&#x27;t here. After a brief pause, Leons tone softened slightly. But what she said next left Shin Yuan and Mu Wan being next door speechless. The candle dragon is a calamity level star beast at the peak of the eighth realm.</p>
<p>Even if the god of war, Ling Long arrives in time, she can only repel it, but cannot kill it completely. We need a new eighth realm powerhouse to completely suppress it and protect the peace of our East Sea. Lie&#x27;s voice became incredibly serious and cruel at this moment. Immediately, right now, take Su Chingu back to the lab. Use every method at all costs to get her.</p>
<p>This is your battlefield. The sound from the communicator abruptly stopped. Shin Yuans mind went blank, his nerves torn apart by a fierce struggle between reason and emotion. Such walked over from behind him. That usually radiant, intelligent face now carried a hint of morbid excitement and a fanatical awareness that one could sacrifice everything for science.</p>
<p>She reached out her hand as if trying to grab Shin Yuan. Did you hear that, my dear Mr. Shin? Her voice was deep, filled with a deadly allure. Our battle has only just begun. After saying that, she grabbed Shin Yuan&#x27;s still somewhat stiff hand and dragged him back to his private lounge without saying another word.</p>
<p>Bang! The alloy door closed again. This completely shut out the deafening sounds of artillery fire and the earthshattering battle cries outside the door. Inside the lounge, the pink lighting remained ambiguous. Shinuan, however, was like a wild beast trapped in a cage, his eyes bloodshot, staring absently at the battle monitoring light screen on the wall. Let me go.</p>
<p>Shinyuans voice was hoarse as he tried to break free from Su Ching Xus grasp. Calm down. For the first time, Such Ching Xus tone carried a reprimanding tone. She stood in front of Shun Yuan, staring directly into his eyes that seemed to be spitting fire. What realm are you at now? A fourth realm Grand Marshall master.</p>
<p>What can you do if you go out? Cause trouble for longing or become a piece of meat in the mouth of a star beast, distracting her to save you? She&#x27;s a fifth realm Grandmaster, an SS ranked dragon soul battle body. Her physique far surpasses that of ordinary people. Xiao Jingua and Li Yun are both in the command center. Do you think they won&#x27;t be paying close attention to her? She&#x27;s much safer than you. Shinyuan knew that what she said was true, but that&#x27;s the truth.</p>
<p>He had to watch helplessly as his woman fought valiantly outside while he stayed here. How could he possibly accept this? Seeing the lingering struggle and pain in Shan Yuans eyes, Su Ching Xus gaze softened surprisingly. She released his hand, stepped forward, opened her arms, and gently embraced the man who was suffering greatly. Her voluuptuous, soft, and warm body clung tightly to him. I know you&#x27;re worried about her, and so am I.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu rested her cheek on his shoulder. Her voice no longer the coldness of a scientist, nor the allure of lovers, but a rare tenderness and firmness. But Leun is right. Our battlefield is here. Have you forgotten? What was your reward for completing the mission? You know better than I what that 5% means.</p>
<p>It means that tens of thousands of dragon brilliance and tens of thousands of cold moons will be born in the future. It means that we will have more confidence when facing the next or even more terrifying beast tide. So put away your useless personal heroism. She looked up her beautiful eyes which always gleamed with a probing light behind her gold- rimmed glasses staring at him intently. Be a man and fulfill your mission.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan looked at her at the rationality, gentleness, and determination in her eyes. The rage and fury in my heart miraculously subsided. &quot;Yes, what&#x27;s the use of jumping around in a panic here? It&#x27;s meaningless except for self-pity.&quot; He pulled the beauty in his arms, even tighter, burying his face in her fragrant hair. His voice muffled. &quot;I see.&quot; He raised his head, and his dark eyes had regained their clarity.</p>
<p>Since that&#x27;s the case, then I can&#x27;t let my messy personal hobbies get mixed in anymore. The task must be completed as soon as possible. He looked at Su Ching Xu with a smile that was more like a grimace. Dr. Su, thank you for your hard work.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu was slightly takenback, then burst into laughter. She gently patted his back as if comforting a sulking boy. Looking at her current appearance, Shin Yuan suddenly said something as if possessed. Did you know the way you are now compared to your white lab coat, your G-cup figure, and all your usual weird and wonderful activities, more attractive? Such brain went blank for a moment. The personal terminal on her wrist emitted a sharp alarm.</p>
<p>Heart rate 185. Adrenaline levels too high. Dopamine levels warning. Data overflow. Such hurriedly turned off the damn alarm, revealing for the first time the embarrassment and shyness of a young woman in front of this man.</p>
<p>She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, which had slipped down her nose and cleared her throat, trying to appear calm. &quot;Well, since you&#x27;ve already figured it out, then don&#x27;t waste any more time. Every second outside, soldiers are sacrificing their lives.&quot; Her voice returned to its usual cool and aloof tone, but her slightly trembling eyelashes, and the way she avoided meeting Shaun Yuan&#x27;s gaze betrayed the turmoil in her heart. The academic discussion is now beginning. Chapter 122.</p>
<p>Natural disaster strikes. A great wall of flesh and blood formation. Woo woo dash. The piercing shrill alarm shattered the tranquil night sky of Donghai city without warning. This is not a drill, nor is it a warning.</p>
<p>This is the highest level of blood red alert, signifying that the annihilation of the city has already arrived. A death now. The bustling city that never sleeps seemed to be instantly silenced, falling into a deathly stillness for a second. The next second there was utter chaos and panic like a volcanic eruption. A beast tide.</p>
<p>A beast tide is coming. Run. Get to the shelter now. On the streets, citizens, their faces ashen with fear, screamed and cried as they frantically rushed toward the nearest underground shelter entrance, dragging their families along with them. The hover cars crashed haphazardly through the crowded streets.</p>
<p>Alarms, cries, and collisions blending into a symphony of impending doom. Some elderly people who had experienced the last beast tide had a numbness etched into their bones. They mechanically held their grandchildren&#x27;s hands, constantly muttering, &quot;Hurry up.&quot; The horrific scene of that bustling metropolis being submerged by endless star beasts and millions of lives being turned into blood and gore is a nightmare etched into the genes of every Dragoxia person. At this moment, the nightmare begins again. Inside the Umbrella Corporation, the atmosphere was heavy and oppressive, and the glaring red warning lights cast shadows of despair on everyone&#x27;s faces.</p>
<p>On the huge holographic main screen, a terrifying scene resembling the apocalypse in mythology, is being displayed in real time. The black tsunami, hundreds of meters high, like a towering, moving city wall, is sweeping towards the coastline of Donghai City with overwhelming force. That&#x27;s not seaater at all. That was a death wave formed by the flesh and blood of hundreds of millions of deep sea star beasts with ferocious faces and huge bodies. The overwhelming aura of ferocity seemed to penetrate the screen, causing even the seasoned warriors in the command center, who were used to life and death, to feel a chill run down their spines, and the air itself to become thick and cold.</p>
<p>Li Yun and Zhiao Jingua, who had already changed into black exoskeleton combat armor, were standing in front of the command platform at the umbrella base. Their faces showed no panic, only the iron will and composure displayed by highlevel martial artists in the face of war. Report: Titan main cannons numbered 1 through 30 are fully charged and ready to fire. Report: The three air-to-air fighter squadrons, Sword, Sky, and Thunder have all taken off. They are on route to their designated airspace.</p>
<p>Report: AllQi and blood enhancement potions in the company&#x27;s logistics department have been loaded. The drone delivery system has been activated. Along that steel defense line stretching for hundreds of miles, 100 Titan class city defense cannons, each 100 meters tall, roared at the same time. Boom boom boom boom boom. Beams of destruction powerful enough to instantly evaporate a lake ripped through the dark night sky, striking the boundless tide of star beasts with unparalleled precision like punitive spears descended from the heavens.</p>
<p>In that instant, the sky was died a fiery white. An energy explosion erupted at the very heart of the beast tide, creating a small but massive wave and a storm of flesh and blood. At the epicenter of the explosion, the smaller low-level star beasts were instantly vaporized and evaporated before they could even scream. However, this saturation firepower coverage, which would make any highlevel human martial artist tremble with fear, was like throwing a 100 pebbles into the ocean for the hundreds of millions of beasts. The light faded.</p>
<p>The central area that was bombarded was indeed largely cleared out, leaving behind a huge hole that was still churning with charred flesh and blood. But in just a few seconds, the hole was instantly filled by the endless horde of beasts behind it. Further away, those highle star beasts whose size was comparable to trucks or even small warships were tough and thick-skinned. After withstanding the bombardment of a main cannon, they were only shaken by the shockwave. Their hard shells didn&#x27;t even have a single crack.</p>
<p>The devastating bombardment, on the contrary, completely unleashed their inherent ferocity. Roar dash. his dash. More ferocious and frenzied roars came from the beast tide. Their impact speed did not decrease, but increased inside the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s command center.</p>
<p>Everyone&#x27;s hearts sank to the bottom as they watched the almost unchanged battle results on the light screen. Damn it. Zia Jinga slammed his fist on the hard alloy command platform and cursed. Are these bastards on drugs? They&#x27;re even harder than last time. Lie&#x27;s face was also extremely pale.</p>
<p>Her fingernails dug deeply into her palms and blood flowed down between her fingers, but she felt nothing. It&#x27;s that candle dragon. It&#x27;s using its dragon might to inflict some kind of buff on the entire beast tide. We must find a way to restrain it. That being said, everyone knows that this is an impossible task.</p>
<p>A cataclysmic star beast at the peak of the eighth realm unless a marshall emperor of the eighth realm like the goddess of War Ling Long personally arrives. Otherwise, any expert at the fifth, sixth, or even seventh realm would be no different from an ant in its presence. Report: The beast tide is only 10 km away from the coastline. Report: The First Energy Shields energy reserve has dropped to 30%. It is estimated to last for a maximum of 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Requesting tactical guidance. The urgent alarms and requests created an extremely tense atmosphere in the command center. Just then, a cold yet resolute voice came through from a separate communication channel. I am Longing. I will lead one of the company&#x27;s Dragon Fong Special Forces teams to zone one to carry out a decapitation mission.</p>
<p>Target: All highle star beasts of the fourth realm or above into beast tide. The city walls must not be breached before I return. Upon hearing this voice, Leans heart tightened, and without thinking, she immediately spoke up to stop it. Longing, don&#x27;t you know your current physical condition? Get back here immediately. That&#x27;s an order.</p>
<p>All I heard from the other end of the communicator was a busy signal. Lie looked at the screen at the figure who had transformed into a golden streak of light, charging headlong into the very center of the beast tied. This crazy girl. Ziaoing walked to her side and patted her shoulder heavily, his voice. Let her go.</p>
<p>This was her choice as a future war god that the company was striving to cultivate. We must believe her. Besides, he turned his head and looked at the other corner of the screen at the solitary figure that had also transformed into a streak of ice blue light, following closely behind Ling. Chapter 1:23. Lung Yu and Ling guard the border city.</p>
<p>On the towering steel walls, cannon fire roared and smoke filled the air. Tens of thousands of warriors relying on the sturdy fortifications unleashed a barrage of firepower at the surging star beasts below. Most of them weren&#x27;t even martial artists. They were just ordinary people with slightly better physical abilities. The standard issue energy rifles in their hands with a single energy bullet might only leave a shallow white mark on the carropase of those low-level star beasts.</p>
<p>But none of them backed down. Fear and tension were visible on their faces. But more than that, there was a deep-seated overwhelming hatred for these beasts who invaded our home. A die, you son of a All of you die. a young soldier who looked only 18 or 19 years old with a somewhat childish face, had bloodshot eyes, and was holding a heavy energy machine gun that was wider than his body, firing wildly at the area below.</p>
<p>The terrifying recoil made his frail body tremble, but his finger on the trigger remained as steady as a rock. His name is Wong Hu, and he is a local from Donghai City. His parents died in the last beast tide when he was 10 years old. He would never forget that day, the overwhelming monsters and his parents&#x27; torn, bloodied bodies. From that day on, he vowed to join the army and avenge his parents with his own hands.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s going to kill all these beasts. Damn it, I&#x27;ll fight you to the death. His comrades in arms were also roaring and howling. Some of them did it to protect their wives and children. Some people do it to avenge their deceased relatives.</p>
<p>What sustains them is no longer cold orders, but the purest and most fervent patriotism etched into the bones of every lung sha person. However, individual bravery always seems insignificant and powerless against the grand backdrop of racial warfare. Boom dash, a deafening explosion. The first energy shield on the outermost edge of the city wall finally shattered like broken glass after withstanding the frenzied attacks of hundreds of millions of star beasts for more than 10 minutes. Without the protection of the energy shield, the black beast tide instantly surged to the foot of the steel city wall.</p>
<p>Countless enormous star beasts with sharp limbs began to frantically climb the vertical steel wall hundreds of meters high, relying on their terrifying brute force. Fire. Fire freely. Shoot them down. On the city wall, the company captain in charge of command let out a horse roar.</p>
<p>Countless energy projectiles and small rockets rained down on the climbing star beasts. The defensive capabilities of these star beasts far exceeded their expectations. Most of the attacks only resulted in a series of powerless sparks flying off their hard shells. Only a few shells which happen to hit their eyes, joints, or other vulnerable parts can blast them off the wall. Ah, a scream.</p>
<p>A massive armored crablike creature the size of a truck and equipped with two enormous iron pincers successfully climbed the city wall. Its massive claws, gleaming with a cold metallic light, were simply flicked. He then cut the soldiers in front of him along with their weapons in half at the waist. Blood and inrols instantly splattered all over the cold steel floor. You beast, I&#x27;ll fight you to the death.</p>
<p>A surviving martial artist watched his comrade in arms with whom he had spent every day died tragically before his eyes and his eyes instantly turned red. He roared, clutching the last individual energy cannon in his arms and charged towards the rampaging armored crab beast. He wanted to die together with this beast just as he was about to rush towards the giant beast. A graceful figure in icy blue appeared silently before him like a ghost. She was a stunningly beautiful woman wearing a black, tight-fitting combat suit with short, neat hair and an icy knifeike demeanor.</p>
<p>It was a cold moon. She extended a fair, slender hand, which contained the power of the four realms. Facing the armored crab beast that was about to swing its giant claws again, it gently grasped its claws in midair. Click. A crisp sound of bones shattering rang out.</p>
<p>That fourthrem armored crab beast, with its terrifying giant claws capable of cutting through steel, was actually crushed to pieces in midair by an invisible, extremely cold force. Roar. The intense pain caused it to let out a painful roar. However, this is just the beginning. A cold, murderous intent flashed in Longus&#x27;s icy blue eyes.</p>
<p>She slammed both hands onto the ground. Glacier, a visible, extremely cold aura mixed with countless ice crystals spread wildly outwards from her center. In an instant, within a radius of 30 m, all the star beasts that were climbing the city wall froze in their tracks. A layer of frost shimmering with a ghostly blue light had formed on their bodies. The blood is frozen.</p>
<p>The action was delayed. Under extreme cold, that hard shell gradually became fragile. On the city wall, the soldiers who had been terrified were quickly brought to their senses after a brief moment of shock. Fire. Fire now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s instructor Lung Yu. It&#x27;s Lord Lung Yu. Brothers, the goddess has come to our rescue. Shoot these frozen scumbags down. Countless energy projectiles poured down once again.</p>
<p>This time, the results were outstanding. Those frozen star beasts were like live targets, easily shot off the city walls. In just a few dozen seconds, this already precarious defensive line was completely cleared out. The soldier who was prepared to perish together with the star beast stared blankly at the unbelievable scene before him and then looked at the ice goddess who simply stood there and suppressed an entire battlefield. There was no sense of relief at surviving a disaster in his eyes.</p>
<p>Only the purest, deepest worship and awe for the strong. With a thud, he knelt on one knee and gave a perfectly standard military salute to Lung Yus back. Thank you so much, Lord Lingua, for saving my life. The warriors behind him followed suit, expressing their utmost respect for the goddess who had saved them all. Within the Umbrella Corporation, everyone knows the names of three outstanding women: Ling, Lung Yu, and Li Yun.</p>
<p>They are the female idols in the hearts of all soldiers. Lung Yu, however, did not turn around. Her gaze pierced through the endless horde of beasts and landed on another even more brutal and frenzied battlefield. There, a golden figure was reaping lives amidst the endless horde of beasts like a terrifying human meat grinder. Chapter 124.</p>
<p>dragon soul battle body fighting three-headed fifth realm peak the very center of the battlefield where the beast tide was at its most turbulent longing was like a golden valkyi bathed in blood facing the endless ferocious monsters all alone she had no weapon her body is the most terrifying weapon in the world the golden figure weave through the beast tide each strike unleashing a storm of blood and gore Imperial military boxing a basic fist technique that every dragon summer martial artist knows was simplified in her hands and became the most efficient killing technique. Steel body on her fair skin. A layer of fine golden dragon scale patterns was faintly visible, making her already powerful body even harder than special alloys. The countless low-level star beasts claws and fangs, sharp enough to tear apart tanks, could only produce a series of earpiercing metallic scraping sounds when they landed on her. They couldn&#x27;t even tear her crisp military uniform.</p>
<p>She completely ignored the attacks of those ants. Her figure like a giant ax that splits the sky and suddenly cleaved down. Storm kick. A solid crescent-shaped golden blade of energy shot out from her straight long military boots. Along the way, more than a dozen enormous third realm star beasts were cleaved in two, their hard shells and fouls smelling flesh spilling out onto the ground.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. Without pausing for a moment, Longing raised two slender white fingers and pointed them at a giant deep sea python of the fourth realm that was opening its blood red m and preparing to ambush other martial artists in the distance. Finger gun. A golden finger gust of wind condensed to its extreme tore through the air emitting a sharp whistling sound. It instantly peers through a distance of hundreds of meters, precisely entering the bloody mouth of the giant sea serpent and exiting from the back of its head.</p>
<p>A gaping hole, completely exposed from front to back, suddenly appeared. The giant python&#x27;s massive body crashed to the ground, creating a wave of blood. Just one person, Longing, forcefully pinned the attack, which was like a black tsunami, to the spot in this defensive zone. where she stood, corpses piled up and blood flowed like a river, forming an insurmountable line of death. Meanwhile, in another war zone, Lung Yu displayed a fighting style completely different from Long Yings.</p>
<p>She held her hands outstretched, her icy blue eyes devoid of any emotion, only a chilling aura rank. A talent ice elemental mastery unleashed its full power. Frosty Hell. A chilling aura, even more biting than the polar cold current, spread outwards from her in all directions. In an instant, within a radius of 100 m, the sweltering summer knight instantly transforms into an ice age.</p>
<p>Those star beasts within the domain, whether they were the thick-skinned third realm iron armored tortoises or the incredibly fast fourthrem shadow leopards, all became sluggish and stiff the moment they came into contact with that chill. Thick frost had formed on their joints, making a cracking sound with every movement, severely affecting their mobility. Their blood flow rate is reduced to freezing point, greatly diminishing their strength and reaction speed. Now, focus fire. On the city wall, the commander in charge of this war zone seized the opportunity and roared at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>Countless cannon shots rained down once again. This battle was a resounding success. Those star beasts affected by the frost domain were like slowmoving live targets, easily hit in their vital points and blasted into ice shards and blood clots. Lung Yu alone managed to keep thousands of star beasts firmly under control in a war zone. Ly Yings doineering nature, Lung Yu&#x27;s control, two goddesses with vastly different styles, yet equally powerful, are like two potent stimulants piercing deep into the hearts of every soldier fighting a bloody battle.</p>
<p>Morale is at an all-time high. Long live the god of war, Longing. Instructor Lung Yu is invincible. Inside the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s highest command center, Li Yun watched the two stunningly beautiful figures on the screen, maneuvering amidst the beast tide. Longing Lyu, don&#x27;t linger in the fight.</p>
<p>The Imperial Beast extermination special operations team will arrive in half an hour. Maintain formation, fight and retreat, and conserve your strength. Her gaze swept over the steadily decreasing city defense energy value on the screen and her nails dug into her flesh. The worst case scenario has still occurred. Behind the beast tide within the endless black waves, three enormous, suffocatingly large red energy reactions were rapidly converging on Lyings location.</p>
<p>Those were three genuine peak level star beasts of the fifth realm. Deep sea demon octopus, three-headed kisame, giant spirit crab king. This sea area is dominated by the most powerful overlord besides the candle dragon. They abandon their attack on the city wall and instead focus their attention on the golden figure that had caused them the most trouble. They will join forces to annihilate this unparalleled genius of the human race.</p>
<p>Oh no, Leons heart clenched suddenly. Ling was surrounded. Although Longing is strong, she has only just broken through to the fifth realm and her realm is not yet stable. Moreover, she is pregnant. In a one-on-one situation, she fears no opponent of the same rank.</p>
<p>But being outnumbered by three is almost certainly a death sentence. Dragon Slayer squad, go provide support immediately. She grabbed the communicator and roared into the special operations channel on the other end. However, distant water cannot quench a nearby fire. The battlefield is everchanging.</p>
<p>The three star beasts at the peak of the fifth realm have launched a deadly combined attack on Ling from three directions. The deep sea demon octopus&#x27;s hundreds of steel-like tentacles blocked all of Long Yings escape routes from all directions. The three-headed Kisames three gaping moss filled with menacing sharp teeth bit down on Lyings head, waist, and legs from the top, middle, and bottom. The giant crab king raised its mountain-sized dark golden claw high and slammed it down on Long Yings head. A trap set in heaven and earth.</p>
<p>A deadly scheme on the city wall. All the soldiers who witnessed this scene let out desperate cries. It&#x27;s over. Is the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s youngest future female warrior about to fall here today? At that critical moment, surrounded by the three-headed star beast king, Long Yings usually cold and aloof face showed no fear whatsoever. Instead, she raised a proud and battle ready smile.</p>
<p>Good timing. A clear, high-pitched whistle resounded through the sky. The next second, on her fair and delicate skin, the golden dragon scale pattern suddenly burst forth with an extremely dazzling light. A powerful aura several times stronger than before, suddenly erupted from her body. Dragon soul battle body activate.</p>
<p>Roar Dash. A majestic and doineering dragon roar, seemingly from ancient mythology, exploded behind her. A phantom of a divine dragon, hundreds of meters long and made of pure golden energy, roared out from behind her, its eyes, resembling two small sons. At this moment, Lyings aura surged dramatically. From the early stage of the fifth realm Grandmaster, he soared directly to the peak of the fifth realm Grandmaster.</p>
<p>That oppressive aura even caused the three-headed star beast king&#x27;s attack to falter. Chapter 125. The dragon slayer squad. A standoff between the eight realms. What is that? A dragon.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a dragon. The war goddess Longing can actually transform into a dragon. The soldiers on the city wall stared in disbelief at the towering golden dragon shadow. Their eyes filled with almost fanatical worship. Umbrella Corporation headquarters.</p>
<p>Temporary observation room. Lynn, Sharon, and Natasha, who witnessed this scene through screen sharing, were so shocked that they covered their mouths. Even the usually calm and composed Muan Bing was deeply shocked by this mythical scene. Is this the true power of an SS level talent on the battlefield, facing the combined attack of three king-level star beasts, Longing, having activated her dragon soul battle body, advanced instead of retreating. The sword in her hand had been sheathed at some point.</p>
<p>At this moment, she combined the essence of the five styles into one, transforming it into the ultimate killing move that she, as a grandmaster of the fifth realm, had just comprehended. Dragon Fong Break. She brought together three slender fair fingers that exuded an aura of invincibility, leaving a blur as she vanished. The next second, when she reappeared, she was already standing behind the three king level star beasts. Time seemed to have been paused.</p>
<p>The three star beasts at the peak of the fifth realm all stopped moving abruptly. On their foreheads, a finger-shaped hole appeared, emitting wisps of blue smoke. Immediately, the three enormous bodies collapsed with a crash. A stench of blood splattered everywhere. Three-finger instant kill of three kings of the same rank.</p>
<p>This scene was transmitted back to the command center from the battlefield via drones. Sister Longing is simply a living legend. She&#x27;s so cool. Lynn Sharon covered her mouth, her clear eyes filled with the admiration and longing a little girl has for her idol. He&#x27;s more than just handsome.</p>
<p>Natasha nodded solemnly, her charming face revealing an undisguised lingering fear. Even if I break through to the peak of the fourth realm, I wouldn&#x27;t even have a chance to react to her move just now. She was able to capture me and Angelina so effortlessly back then. She probably didn&#x27;t even use a tenth of her strength. Hearing the conversation between the two women, Muan Bing, who had been silent all along, suddenly narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>She turned her head sharply, looking at the tightly closed door of the lounge room belonging to Shun Yuan and Su Ching Zhu with a completely new and scrutinizing gaze. This incredibly powerful woman also belongs to Shin Yuan. What makes that man so special? What secret does he hold? One question after another, like vines, entangled her rational and calculating heart. For the first time, this sparked in her a stronger curiosity about a man than about studying cuttingedge technology. On the battlefield, Long Yings earthshattering strike of annihilating three kings with three fingers greatly boosted the morale of all the soldiers, but she also paid a considerable price for it.</p>
<p>Her pretty face turned pale, and her breathing became a little rapid. Killing three king level star beasts of the same rank simultaneously would consume a huge amount of her energy. The beast tide had no end. After a brief moment of shock, more star beasts driven by the invisible will of the eighth realm candle dragon behind them once again fearlessly surged toward the location where she and Lyu were. Just then, whoosh whoosh whoosh, seven sharp whistling sounds ripped through the sky from above Donghai City.</p>
<p>Seven black streaks like shooting stars tore through the clouds that were stained dark red by gunpowder smoke and descended from the sky at supersonic speed. They wore uniform black exoskeleton combat armor that symbolized futuristic technology with flight wings on their backs that spewed blue plasma flames and various ferocious looking special weapons in their hands. They were like black swords falling from the sky, precisely piercing the area where the beast tide was most turbulent and the highle star beasts were most concentrated. Slay the dragon, one of the empires most elite and most mysterious special forces units. arrive.</p>
<p>The leader, a burly man as tall as an iron tower, carrying a plasma battle axe the size of a door panel, let out a thunderous roar the moment he landed. The capital city has been slain. We have been ordered to come and provide support. Madam, go and rest. Well take care of the awful here.</p>
<p>He swung his plasma battle axe across the room with a sudden powerful motion. A terrifying fan-shaped electric arc half a hundred meters long erupted. Wherever it passed, dozens of fourthrem star beasts along with their hard shells were instantly electrolyed and carbonized by the high voltage current kill. The other 16 members also launched an attack at the same time. Some people wielded highfrequency battle blades, their figures as ghostly as they weave through the beast horde.</p>
<p>With each flash of the blade, the head of a highle star beast would inevitably fly off. Some people carried small positron cannons on their shoulders and each time they fired they could clear a vacuum zone with a diameter of more than 50 meters in the beast tide. These seven people are all genuine powerhouses. Their strength is at least at the peak of the fifth realm. The seven of them formed a perfect combat team like a highly efficient killing machine like a red-hot dagger easily tearing a huge gap in the originally impenetrable beast tide.</p>
<p>The pressure of besieging Ling and L Yu has been greatly reduced. Well done. Inside the headquarters command center of the Umbrella Corporation. Lie Yun saw this scene and excitedly slapped her thigh. Meanwhile, the Dragon Slayer squad forcefully penetrated the battlefield from the front.</p>
<p>Muan Bing, who had been watching the battle closely through screen sharing, finally felt a little relieved after seeing the turning point in the battle. Although she abhored war and killing, but she knew all too well that when the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. The reason why Celestial Industries has achieved its current status is inseparable from the huge market of the empire and its relatively stable social environment. If Donghai City falls, her vast business empire will inevitably be greatly affected. Activate the level one emergency response plan for divine protection.</p>
<p>Muan Bing made a quick decision and issued an instruction to the personal terminal on her wrist. Order the underground production base of the East China Sea branch to deploy all the spider series combat robots and angel series flying medical robots in stock to the battlefield. With her command, the heavy alloy gate of the underground base of the East China Sea branch of Tion Industry slowly opened. Hundreds and thousands of spider-like combat robots equipped with G machine guns and micro missiles surged out from underground forming a steel torrent rushing to the front line. In the sky, hundreds of white medical robots equipped with nano repair beams and high energy nutrient solution injectors hovered above the city walls, beginning to provide emergency treatment to the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>A soldier had just had his thigh ripped open by a star beast&#x27;s bone spikes, bleeding profusely. The next second, an angel robot swooped down and a soft green light shone on his wound, causing his flesh to heal at a visible speed. These war machines developed by Celestial Industries, while unable to pose a fatal threat to highle star beasts, greatly relieved the pressure on ordinary soldiers. The casualty rate on the battlefield began to decline at a visible rate. The situation seems to be developing in a positive direction.</p>
<p>However, all the company&#x27;s top executives knew that the real crisis was yet to come. Behind the beast tide in the deep sea shrouded in endless darkness, the candle dragon, a peak level eighth realm creature with a body length of 10,000 m and the size of a mountain, merely stared indifferently at everything before it. It didn&#x27;t move because it could clearly sense two auras in the sky above Donghai City that made its heart pound. One of the auras was that of Chin Lao, the ninth realm demagod who had recently forcibly taken a drop of its hearts blood, causing it great humiliation. The other one was completely new, but it still made it feel a sense of threat.</p>
<p>It was an existence of the same level. Donghai City, 10,000 m above the ground. The space distorted slightly, and a woman dressed in exquisite crimson armor with a stunning figure, as if she had stepped out of mythology, stood quietly on the clouds. She was Ling Long war god, one of the five pillars of the human race who rushed from the capital the moment she received the highest distress signal. She didn&#x27;t look down at the brutal battlefield below, which resembled a meat grinder.</p>
<p>Her phoenix eyes, which seemed to contain the birth and death of the universe, were fixed on the distant deep sea where the candle dragon was also watching her. The king does not meet the king. She knew very well that she only had one task, that is to restrain this beast king. Once she clashed with Zuulong, the devastating aftershocks of the battle would be enough to wipe the entire Donghai city along with tens of millions of lives off the map. This is a silent confrontation of will and patience between top tier experts.</p>
<p>With the combined efforts of many parties, after more than an hour of bloody fighting, the Beast Tide&#x27;s frenzy defensive was finally contained outside the Great Wall of Steel. The battle, which was initially on the verge of collapse, gradually stabilized into a brutal tugofwar that tested the strength and endurance of both sides. Chapter 126. The entire Heavenly God industry is not as good as Shin Yuan alone. The door to the laboratory at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, the one that had been causing Mu Wan Bing so much distress, finally opened.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan, with Su Ching Zhu in his arms, walked out from inside. Inside the lobby, Mu Wam Bing happened to witness this scene. She stared at the horrific battlefield on the screen, a scene of rivers of blood and countless corpses. Look at this shameless couple in front of me like they&#x27;ve just had a 300 round battle. A long suppressed anger, confusion, and inexplicable grievances finally erupted.</p>
<p>Blood flows like a river outside, and warriors are risking their lives to fill the void. you Mu Wan being pointed at the two of them, her expression filled with contempt and disgust. You still have the nerve to do that kind of thing in there. Is it really that urgent? Before Shin Yuan could even speak, she confronted him with her righteous question. Su Ching Zhu, who was in his arms, slowly straightened up.</p>
<p>She elegantly straightened her slightly disheveled white coat and gave Mu Wan Bing, who was glaring at her with anger, a faint yet provocative smile. Mr. Mu, you&#x27;ve misunderstood. We work so hard not for our own enjoyment. She paused, then spoke slowly in a tone of utmost somnity and reverence, as if stating a universal truth.</p>
<p>Some wars do not require going to the battlefield. All of this is for the company&#x27;s future. This shocking explanation made Mu Wan Bing laugh in anger on the spot. She crossed her arms and looked at the two of them as if they were children, a sneer playing on her lips. Su Chingu, do you think I&#x27;m a three-year-old? How can sleeping be related to the future? I want to hear what kind of earthshattering truths you can come up with.</p>
<p>She was ready to use her expertise in business logic and scientific theory to thoroughly refute the woman&#x27;s absurd excuses. Such next words, however, caused her worldview, which was based on rationality and science, to begin to collapse rapidly. Such remained calm and unhurried. She raised her slender finger and pointed to the screen where Longing was dominating the battlefield like a valky. She then said to Mu Wan, Bing in a calm tone, &quot;Mr.</p>
<p>Mu, do you know where the company&#x27;s latest strategic blueprint, the dragon blood tempering pool, came from?&quot; Muaming shook her head. She had just seen those blueprints yesterday. The design concepts, which were 50 years ahead of their time, deeply impressed her. This made her even more puzzled and unable to understand the source. Su Ching Xus smile deepened.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what my husband and she worked so hard for. Upon hearing those words, Mu Wan Bing&#x27;s mind went blank, filled with wave after wave of confusion. They&#x27;ve brought you an SSS level blueprint that&#x27;s 50 years ahead of its time and capable of changing the strategic landscape of the Empire. Is this some kind of logic that a carbon-based life form could possibly come up with? This is a million times more sci-fi than any sci-fi novel she&#x27;s ever read. She strongly suspected that she was experiencing auditory hallucinations because she hadn&#x27;t slept well the night before.</p>
<p>Such Ching Zu did not give Muan Bing any time to think or buffer. A sly smile played on her beautiful intellectual face like a top salesperson presenting a product that could revolutionize the world. Her finger no longer pointed at the light screen, but turned to another corner of the hall. There, Lynn Sharon was holding a bag of potato chips, eating them in small bites. Her big eyes filled with worry as she watched the battlefield screen while Natasha, like a beautiful maid, was carefully peeling grapes for her.</p>
<p>See that girl in the maternity dress? Her name is Lin Char and she&#x27;s Shin Yuans first woman. Lin Char, whose name was called, was taken aback. She looked up and saw Su Ching Zhu and Mu Wan Bing, whose face was icy cold. She waved slightly in this direction, a little embarrassed. Her mouth still stuffed with potato chips, making her mouth bulge.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xus voice remained calm and objective, but her words bombarded Mu Wuan Bings already crumbling understanding. She brought with her the complete formula for the gene potential enhancement potion. According to my preliminary calculations, once this medicine is mass-roduced, it can increase the average awakening rate of our new generation of martial artists by at least 30%. 30%. Mu Waming&#x27;s breath hitched.</p>
<p>As the president of Tianin Industries, she knew better than anyone what the term awakening rate meant to ordinary people. Her gaze was fixed on Lynch. That girl looked delicate and frail. Besides being pretty and cute, she had something special about her. How could she possibly? How is this possible? Such Ching Zus finger then turned to the stunning blonde with blue eyes beside her, who was obsequiously and carefully supporting Lin Sharon.</p>
<p>Natasha sensed the gaze, looked up at Muan Bing with a professional yet slightly boastful smile, and casually fed Lynn Sharon a peeled grape. And then there&#x27;s Natasha, the former top agent of the Free Federation, cenamed Black Widow. The reward she brought was a complete set of recipes for first to fifth tier health and mana enhancement potions. You may not know this, but right now on that bloody battlefield, every Umbrella Corporation warrior fighting valiantly has been injected with this drug. It has no side effects and can permanently increase their maximum health and mana by 10%.</p>
<p>It was thanks to this 10% boost that they were able to barely hold their line during the first wave of the beast tide. It has saved countless lives. Such Zhu turned her head, her beautiful eyes hidden behind her gold- rimmed glasses, staring directly at the completely stunned Mu Wan Bing, a smile on her lips, carrying a hint of a victor. So, Mr. Mu, do you still think we&#x27;re just messing around? Do you still think he&#x27;s just a glib tongue scoundrel? Suing Xu stepped forward, extended her index finger painted with bright red nail polish, and gently tapped Mu Wanings forehead.</p>
<p>In an almost judgmental tone, she said, &quot;Word by word, he is Shinuan. His value alone is greater than your entire celestial industries. These words were like the sharpest dagger, piercing Mu Wan Bings lofty pride as a business queen, leaving her riddled with holes and utterly devastated. This is not the end. A more cruel and cunning smile appeared on Su Ching Xus face.</p>
<p>She leaned close to Mu Wanings ear and whispered the most cruel and deadly words in a seductive, devilish voice. Don&#x27;t disbelieve it. Do you think that&#x27;s all? Once he wins first place in this battle of geniuses, your precious little sister, Mu Ching Shiua, whom you&#x27;ve protected like a porcelain doll, will foolishly offer herself to you, just like you did back then. She would give anything for a man. You, Muan Bing, suddenly raised her head, and a crazy, outofc control rage appeared in her cold and rational eyes.</p>
<p>She remembered how she had done the same thing back then, willing to break with her family and give everything for that kind of man. What they received in return was the most ruthless betrayal and humiliation. And now her sister is going to repeat her mistakes. She was so foolish back then, and her sister is even more foolish than her. Puff.</p>
<p>Her vision went black and the chilling energy within her surged up, causing her to nearly faint on the spot from anger. Just as she was about to collapse, a pair of strong, large hands pulled him into a tight embrace. Shin Yuan looked at the icy beauty in his arms who had fainted on the spot from a few words from Su Chingu and was speechless. This female demon is too ruthless. She kills people by destroying their spirit.</p>
<p>He shook his head helplessly, then affectionately flicked Su Chingus nose, who had a cunning expression on her face as she stood next to him, looking like she had a well-thoughtout plan. Okay, let&#x27;s be gentle with our words. Don&#x27;t scare away our future partner. This intimate gesture, this doting tone, this way of addressing us once again. It accidentally pierced Mu Wandings heart.</p>
<p>Chapter 127. The iceberg female CEO&#x27;s heart flutters. Who says so and so is one of your own? Don&#x27;t talk nonsense. She struggled free and stood up straight from Shun Yuan&#x27;s embrace, but the lingering warmth made her feel a strange unease. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t force her, letting go of her hand and allowing her to take two steps back.</p>
<p>He looked at the ice queen in front of him, who was clearly cornered, but still held her chin high, maintaining her last bit of pride, and slowly walked forward. &quot;Mr. Mu, you know best how troublesome the thousand cold body within you is. My undying flame soul is the only thing in this world that can heal you.&quot; He approached step by step, the distance between them shrinking to less than half a meter. His aggressive masculine aura made Mu Wan being subconsciously tense up.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans gaze fell on her long, slender legs clad in stockings, and his smile deepened. I will treat you a few more times in the future. Won&#x27;t we gradually become one of our own? This blatant implication caused Mu Wan Bings pretty face, which had just regained a sliver of color, to instantly burn red. I am filled with shame and indignation. She raised her foot, clad in an elegant high heel, and with all her might kicked the shameless man in front of her in the shin.</p>
<p>Look, here we go again. The warmth from Shan Yuans palms seeped into her skin again, thread by thread. Mu Wandings body stiffened. That familiar warm current, which could melt the chill in her bones, made her mind go blank for a moment. Su Ching Zhu, who was standing next to him, couldn&#x27;t stand the excitement and immediately joined in, adding fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>She walked to Mu Wan Binging other side, affectionately took her arm and winked at her in a tone of sharing a best friend&#x27;s thoughts. Mr. Mu, don&#x27;t be angry. You can kick him now. He&#x27;s tough and won&#x27;t refuse.</p>
<p>Once you&#x27;re one of us, you can kick me however you want. Shinyuan rolled his eyes. Do you think you can just kick my handsome face whenever you want? At the very least, they should verify your qualifications first. It&#x27;s incredibly ugly. The two of them sang in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>Their collaboration seamless. Muan Bing listened to Su Ching Xus teasing, which sounded like that of a caring older sister. The man in front of her had shattered her worldview, and the woman had similarly shattered it. An absurd yet irrefutable thought rose wildly in her mind. Are they telling the truth? If that&#x27;s really the case, then shouldn&#x27;t I? For the future of Heavenly God Industries, and for my damned thousand cold body, also no.</p>
<p>Impossible. She, Muan Bing, would never become a subservient figure to this man like these women. Her pride wouldn&#x27;t allow her to bow down to a handsome scumbag who was also good at flirting with women. Just as she was torn between her inner thoughts and her own mind, struggling with an immense inner conflict, Natasha, standing to the side, couldn&#x27;t help but laugh out loud at her conflicted expression. She recalled how just a few days ago, Su Chingu had publicly exposed the true nature of her theoretical master, leaving her utterly ashamed.</p>
<p>Now seeing a cold, aloof female CEO whose status is 100 times higher than hers end up in the same predicament as herself, she finally found a sense of balance. Turns out I&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s this unlucky. Lynn Sharon on the other side blinked her big eyes belatedly. She glanced at Sister Longing, who was dominating the screen. Then at Sister Natasha, who looked at her with a similar expression of sympathy, and then at Sister Su, who had made the seemingly powerful Som Mu cry with just a few words.</p>
<p>For the first time, she gained a completely new understanding of Shun Yuans family. So, all my older sisters are this amazing. She looked at Shun Yuan, her do-like eyes filled with pride and admiration. My man is truly the best in the world. In front of her, Shun Yuan grabbed Su Ching Xu, who was watching the show with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>Amidst Su Ching Xus suppressed gasp, he whistled and nonchalantly returned to his room. Mr. Mu, please think it over carefully. My treatment is effective anytime. However, it won&#x27;t be free next time you come.</p>
<p>The teasing voice drifted out from behind the closed door. Mu wandings expression changed in anger. Only the woman remained in the hall, looking at each other in bewilderment. Natasha looked at the tightly closed door and couldn&#x27;t help but lower her voice to gossip to Lin Sharon. Chu ran.</p>
<p>Do you think Ching Xus skills will increase significantly after graduating this time? But can the master really hold on? Lynn Sharon nodded with a worried expression. She knew better than anyone how terrifying her man&#x27;s sexual prowess was. But Sister Suing Zhu seems even fiercer than her master. Lynn Sharan stroked her lower abdomen and whispered, &quot;Yes, yes, Shinuan has been working so hard. I&#x27;ll go and make him some nineyong deer antler soup to help him recover.</p>
<p>The two whispered among themselves, discussing how to replenish the nutrition of their meritorious soldier. Only Muan Bing was in utter turmoil. Her mind was filled with grand concepts like strategic blueprints and genetic potential, enough to suffocate her. Chapter 128 permanently enhanced genetic potential. 2 days later, the fighting along the East China Sea border was extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Even with the addition of the Dragon Slayer squad and the robot legion of God industries, the defense line could barely hold. An endless tide of beasts, wave after wave, relentlessly assaulted the great wall forged from flesh and steel. The soldiers had been fighting continuously for 48 hours and were exhausted both physically and mentally. Many people&#x27;s energy rifle barrels were glowing red-hot, forcing them to take turns resting. Just as despair hung like a dark cloud over the hearts of every soldier and they thought the city was about to fall inside the laboratory&#x27;s breakroom.</p>
<p>Ding. Detection indicates the host and target have completed their 89th interaction. Ding. Congratulations host. You have successfully brought good fortune to Sue Chingu, the holder of S-level talent.</p>
<p>Special strategy mission. Sparks of scientific research completed. Ding ding ding. Task reward settlement in progress. A series of system notifications, like the most powerful stimulant, were injected into Shun Yuan&#x27;s dying body.</p>
<p>His pupils, which were somewhat unfocused due to extreme fatigue, suddenly contracted. It&#x27;s done. It really worked. When he came to his senses, the golden reward panel unfolded in his mind like a waterfall. Personal reward.</p>
<p>One random S-rank bloodline awakening card already stored in system space. Personal reward. permanently increased the upper limit of gene potential development by 5%. S-rank bloodline awakening genetic potential increased by 5%. Shin Yuan felt as if the top of his head was about to be blown off by this immense happiness.</p>
<p>Before he could even fully savor this ecstasy, the golden personal reward panel suddenly burst forth with an extremely dazzling light. The next second, an invisible yet indescribably vast and mysterious power spread out like ripples from the laboratory where Shun Yuan and Su Ching Zhu were located. This force ignored spatial distance and material obstacles and in less than a second it enveloped the entire Umbrella Corporation headquarters, the entire Dongai city and the entire Lia Empire. Donghai City, a great wall of flesh and blood defense line. The battle has reached a fever pitch.</p>
<p>An old soldier nearing 40 and whose cultivation had been stuck at the peak of the first realm of martial arts for 10 years. Having long since given up any hope of breaking through was wielding his alloy battle sword in a final desperate battle against a second tier swordspine fishermen. His body was already covered in wounds and his vital energy was completely depleted. The sharp bone spikes of the sword&#x27;s pine fishmen pierced his lower abdomen, and the excruciating pain made his vision go black, almost causing him to faint on the spot. Is this the end? A hint of resentment and despair flashed in the veteran&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>He thought of his wife and daughter, who were still in the rear shelter, waiting for him to return. No. A will to survive made him let out a roar that sounded inhuman. Just then, a warm and vast mysterious power surged up from the deepest part of his bloodline without warning. He felt a fresh, life-giving spring flowing into his long dried up meridians.</p>
<p>The formidable bottleneck that had plagued him for a full decade was easily pierced with a pop. At this moment, boom, a surge of energy surpassing even that of a martial artist of the first realm erupted within him. Second realm warrior. He actually broke through to a higher level just before he died. Haha.</p>
<p>The veteran laughed wildly, his laughter revealing the ecstasy of surviving a catastrophe. Ignoring the excruciating pain in his abdomen, he used the last of his strength to slash his sword into the astonished head of the swordsman. Then he fell peacefully with a smile on his face. At the same time, the other end of the city wall, an ordinary soldier who had just turned 18 and was not even a martial artist, was holding an energy rifle and firing wildly at the surging beast horde below, trembling with fear. A first realm armored crab beast, over a meter tall, had its ferocious giant claws raised high as it passed through the barrage of fire alongside its kin.</p>
<p>The next second, it would crush the beast and the section of the city wall beneath its feet. I&#x27;m dying. I&#x27;m dying. The young soldier closed his eyes in despair. Just a second before death struck.</p>
<p>That same mysterious power originating from the depths of his bloodline also surged into his heart. He felt a buzzing in his brain as if something had been forcibly opened up. Successfully awakened the D-rank talent hardening. Awakening of a talent. The young soldier opened his eyes and instinctively crossed his arms to shield himself.</p>
<p>The next second, his skin turned into a grayish black color that shimmerred with a metallic sheen. Clang, a crisp metallic clang rang out. The young soldier stared in disbelief at his unharmed arm. What&#x27;s going on? Is he dreaming? In the field medical ward, a young female doctor was kneeling on the ground, sweating profusely as she treated the wounds of a seriously injured warrior. Her healing abilities had been exhausted, and she could only watch helplessly as the officer&#x27;s vital signs continued to decline.</p>
<p>She cried, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry. I&#x27;m so sorry.&quot; Her face full of helplessness. At that moment, that mysterious force brushed against her body. A warm current flowed through my body, and my depleted spirit was restored, even more abundant than in its prime. She instinctively placed her hand on the martial artist&#x27;s wound.</p>
<p>A soft green light, brighter than ever before, burst forth. The wound healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. My talent, dear rank healing hand, is even more powerful now. Miracles were unfolding wildly in every corner of the battlefield. Countless veterans who had been stuck at a bottleneck for years miraculously broke through in battle.</p>
<p>Countless ordinary soldiers who should have died silently on the battlefield awakened their long-awaited talents in desperate situations. First, there was the veteran who had just broken through, was promptly healed by the flying medical robot, and was able to stand up again and continue fighting. He stared blankly at the power within his body, then turned around in a days, looking at the Umbrella Corporation headquarters behind him, a place that felt incredibly mysterious to him for the first time. Next came the young soldier who had awakened his talent. As if guided by something, his gaze passed over the countless ferocious star beasts and landed in the same direction.</p>
<p>Then there was the female doctor, the artilleryman who had just awakened her fire control, and the squad leader who had broken through to the third realm of martial arts. More and more people, after experiencing the ecstasy of escaping death and gaining immense power, unanimously turned their gazes, a mixture of awe, fervor, and gratitude to the deepest part of the company&#x27;s headquarters base. At the same time, everyone felt as if a god was looking down on them. Chapter 129. The exquisite war god is astonished.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lung Yu, who was locked in battle with a deep sea naga at the peak of the fifth realm amidst the beast tide, also sensed this change. The bottleneck within her body, which had been stirring due to Shun Yuan&#x27;s dragon energy, loosened. Now, a terrifying glint flashed in Lung Yus icy blue eyes. She held nothing back, pouring all her inner energy into the highfrequency battle blade in her hand. Ice Dragon Break Roar.</p>
<p>A lifelike ice crystal dragon formed from extremely cold air roared out and froze the still stunned deep sea naga into a crystalclear ice sculpture. Immediately, the ice sculpture shattered. Meanwhile, Lyu&#x27;s aura rapidly increased. The barrier that had troubled her for two whole years has shattered. Fifth realm Grandmaster.</p>
<p>She finally stepped into the realm of Grandmaster that she had always dreamed of. That&#x27;s how it was achieved. She subconsciously turned around and glanced behind her in the direction of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters. All of this was brought to her by that man. At the same time, in the Dragon Slayer squad, the burly man who had been stuck at the peak of the fifth realm for several years, wielding a plasma battle axe, shuddered the moment he smashed a star beast into a pulp.</p>
<p>An aura far surpassing the fifth realm belonging to a sixth realm marshall king, suddenly erupted. He stared at his hands, stunned by the sudden surge of sixth realm power within him. I I broke through. I became a Marshall king. He hadn&#x27;t yet recovered from this huge surprise.</p>
<p>On the other side of the battlefield, Zhia Jing was smashed the head of a fourth realm star beast with a punch. Just as he was about to catch his breath, his body suddenly stiffened. The next second, a surge of power swept through his limbs and bones, and the bottleneck that had plagued him for nearly 20 years shattered like paper. Six Realms. Marshall King.</p>
<p>Haha. Xiao Jingwa was stunned for three seconds, then burst into a deafening burst of laughter. Holy crap, I knew it. I knew my judgment. Zhiao Jing was the best in the world.</p>
<p>Back when we were testing the awakening who said that kid was just an frrank trash who said I was betting my fortune on a pretty boy. You all better step forward. Inside the headquarters command center of the Umbrella Corporation, everyone around was trembling with fear, not daring to even breathe loudly. After a brief moment of shock, Lean also felt the same changes within her body, and she too broke through. She looked at the warriors still fighting fiercely on the screen, and at the people whose morale had been greatly boosted by this sudden miracle, unleashing tremendous fighting power.</p>
<p>She looked at Lung Yu, who had just broken through to the fifth realm and then charged into the beast tied again like an ice goddess. She watched as longing, who was easily outmaneuvered by several fifth realm star beasts and was even gaining the upper hand. Finally, her gaze fell on the laboratory that belonged to Shun Yuan and Su Ching Zhu, whose door was still tightly closed. That little rascal, a smile of immense satisfaction and pride appeared on Li Yans lips. She connected to Xiao Jingws communication channel and chuckled lightly in a teasing tone.</p>
<p>Xiao, did you see that? This is true self-sacrifice for the company. Honestly, if I didn&#x27;t meet his requirements for an F-level talent and hadn&#x27;t married you, you blockhead so early on, I might have wanted to go in and create a god for our family. Puff on the battlefield, Xiao Jingua, who was immersed in the joy of his breakthrough, stumbled when he heard his wife&#x27;s wild words and almost tripped over the tentacles of a star beast next to him. He frantically cleaved the attacking star beast in two with an ax, then yelled into the communicator, half laughing and half crying. Crazy woman, what nonsense are you spouting? Wait till the war is over and see how I deal with you.</p>
<p>Lean chuckled softly and hung up the call. She looked at the door, her eyes filled with an overwhelming sense of awe. Donghai City, 10,000 m above the ground. The clouds were torn apart by an invisible force, and the exquisite war goddess, clad in crimson armor, was engaged in a silent standoff with the 10,000 m long candle dragon in the deep sea. Suddenly, her usually calm and still Phoenix eyes snapped open.</p>
<p>An invisible wave originating from the very essence of life swept over her body. Her genetic chains, which had already reached the limit of her current level, actually loosened slightly. Genetic potential. The most fundamental thing that determines a martial artist&#x27;s talent level and the upper limit of their realm. It increased out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Although the increase was only 5% for someone like her who had already reached the peak of the eighth realm, it was like a godsend. The path leading to the ninth realm, which was originally blurry, became clearer than a fraction of the way at this moment. The exquisite war goddess was stunned for several seconds. His divine sense spread downwards, covering the entire East China Sea battlefield. She saw it.</p>
<p>Countless warriors breaking through, countless ordinary people awakening. This force is not targeting her alone. It covered the entire war zone. No, not only that. Her divine sense pierced through space, perceiving even more distant inland areas.</p>
<p>All people with the blood of the dragon sa flowing in their veins are experiencing a permanent increase in their genetic potential at a small but certain rate. This is something that no elixir or cultivation technique can achieve. This is a divine gift bestowed upon the entire race from the very bottom of life. The gaze of the exquisite war goddess pierced through layers of clouds and steel, locking onto the most unremarkable laboratory deep within the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s base. Meanwhile, in the deep sea opposite her, the eight realms candle dragon also sensed this change, and endless confusion and rage appeared in its lavalike giant eyes.</p>
<p>Why have these ants, which should have been easily crushed by it, suddenly become so delicious? Chapter 130 Supreme Srank Bloodline. In the laboratory, Shin Yuan lay sprawled out, staring blankly at the ceiling, feeling as if his life had come to an end. For the first time, Shinuan truly realized just how terrifying a woman with a body score of 99 could be. Don&#x27;t move. Shinuan felt his voice was trembling with tears.</p>
<p>He buried his face in Su Ching Xus fragrant hair and groaned weakly. Let me hold you a little longer. Just a little while longer, and my kidneys will hurt. Such Chinghu seemed to have finally finished her research. She leaned lazily against Shu Yuans chest, a healthy and charming blush spreading across her intelligent and beautiful face.</p>
<p>Hearing Shun Yuans pitiful please, she gently drew circles on his firm chest. Promising, she gave a soft snort, her tone carrying a hint of triumphant pride that only Shin Yuan could understand. Can you paint already? I still have several research projects on the relationship between gene interaction frequency and bloodline arousal that I haven&#x27;t finished yet. Shin yuan shuddered and the arms wrapped around her tightened even more. Sister, big sister, I was wrong.</p>
<p>You have a grand theory and whatever you say is right. Seeing his comical, terrified expression, Su Chingu couldn&#x27;t help but burst out laughing. All right, stop pretending to be dead. Check your reward. Her voice regained some of its usual intellect and composure, but the alluring charm in her eyes was even more captivating.</p>
<p>S-rank bloodline. This is something that can transform you completely. Don&#x27;t forget it. Srank bloodline. These four words were like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>Waking Shin Yuan from his muddled mind. Yeah, I even get a reward. He struggled to sit up, snatched Su Ching Xus personal terminal, and when he saw the random S-level bloodline awakening card emitting a sevencolored light in the system space, his tired and dim eyes instantly lit up. These two days and two nights of overtime work were worth it. Use without the slightest hesitation, he silently recited it in his heart.</p>
<p>The next second, the card transformed into a stream of light and flowed into his brow. Ding! S-rank bloodline awakening card successfully used. Start random draw. Congratulations host. You have obtained an S-rank evolved bloodline.</p>
<p>Undying dragon blood. Bloodline name undying dragon blood Srank. Bloodline type evolutionary. Basic ability martial arts compatibility greatly increases the speed of comprehension and practice of all dragon type martial arts and techniques. Innate divine ability.</p>
<p>Dragons might suppress his evil. This ability exerts absolute pressure on demonic beasts, alien races, and those with lower martial arts levels, causing their movements to falter and their vital energy to become disordered. The suppression effect is doubled against targets possessing dragon blood. Special feature one, dragon blood burning. When injured, it can burn blood and chi to accelerate wound healing, and even limbs can regenerate.</p>
<p>Special trait two, unyielding dragon soul. Immune to mental attacks and bloodline pressure below one&#x27;s own cultivation level. Special feature three. Dragon devours all things. Can devour the essence blood of demonic beasts, martial arts crystals, and rare and precious materials, quickly replenishing and purifying one&#x27;s own original blood and energy.</p>
<p>Note, this feature requires your bloodline level to be raised to SSS level to unlock and use. Undying dragon blood. Looking at the incredibly powerful attribute descriptions on the screen, Shinuan felt like his heart was about to jump out of his throat. This is hardly an S-class bloodline. This isn&#x27;t a divine bloodline.</p>
<p>Martial arts in perfect harmony. Dragons might suppress his evil, heals from injuries, replenishes what you eat, and is even immune to mental attacks. How can we lose after this? Haha. Shin Yuan laughed wildly. The fatigue and backachche from the previous two days and nights were all swept away by the immense joy.</p>
<p>However, he hadn&#x27;t even managed to laugh three times. An intense, excruciating pain, as if it were tearing his soul apart, suddenly erupted from the depths of every cell in his body. A dash, a blood curdling scream, so shrill it was inhuman, escaped from Shun Yuan&#x27;s mouth. He felt like his body was a balloon that had been inflated to its limit, about to burst at any moment. Every blood vessel and every meridian under the skin is twisting and expanding wildly.</p>
<p>The bones made cracking sounds as if they were about to break at any moment. An unimaginable high temperature rose from his dantion and instantly swept over his entire body. His skin turned as red-hot as a branding iron within seconds and even began to emit wisps of white smoke. What happened? The sudden turn of events startled Su Chingu, who was standing nearby. Without a second thought, she immediately activated her S-level talent, gene insight.</p>
<p>In her view, the gene chain within Shin Yuan&#x27;s body was undergoing an unprecedented, even violent recombination and evolution. Countless old gene fragments were forcibly torn apart and shattered. Meanwhile, those newly formed golden gene chains containing the bloodline of the immortal dragon were forcibly merging into his body in an extremely savage way. This kind of evolution is too doineering. With Shin Yuan&#x27;s current physical strength as a fourthle grand marshall master, he simply cannot withstand it.</p>
<p>If this continues, he will explode and die on the spot in less than 3 minutes due to the complete collapse of his genetic chain. Damn it. Such Ching Xus expression instantly became extremely solemn. She grabbed the crumpled white lab coat next to her, half-hazardly put it on, and then made an emergency call to her personal terminal on her wrist. Natasha Lynn Sharon come to my lab immediately quickly.</p>
<p>After giving the instructions, she glanced at Shun Yuan, who was convulsing in pain and whose consciousness was becoming somewhat blurred on the operating table, and rushed to the medicine mixing station at the other end of the laboratory. Hold on, you bastard. I haven&#x27;t finished researching you yet. You&#x27;re not allowed to die.&quot; Her voice carried a hint of anxiety and trembling that she herself was unaware of. Bang! The heavy alloy door of the laboratory was smashed open from the outside by a tremendous force.</p>
<p>Natasha and Lynn Sharon rushed in looking flustered. When they saw the scene inside the laboratory, the two of them froze on the spot, their mouth agape in an O shape. Was it a robbery or was it plowed up by missiles? The huge laboratory was in complete disarray. Various sophisticated instruments were tilted haphazardly and some unsightly physiological data curves remained on the light screen. Scattered on the ground were a torn white angel uniform, a red high heel with a broken heel, and several tangled pieces of black stockings.</p>
<p>This battle situation, Natasha looked at the scene of the crime, which resembled the disaster, and then at Shun Yuan, who was convulsing, his skin flushed red as if he were about to spontaneously combust at any moment. Her charming face was filled with shock. She subconsciously swallowed and looked at Su Ching Zhu, who was frantically busy at the medicine counter with an expression of utter disbelief. This isn&#x27;t just a question of strength. This is a monster.</p>
<p>Shinuan. Shinuan, what&#x27;s wrong with you? Lynch was the first to react. She cried out and rushed to the operating table, wanting to hug Shin Yuan, but the burning heat on his body made her gasp and pull her hand back. It&#x27;s so hot. Don&#x27;t touch him.</p>
<p>Such Ching Zu shouted angrily without turning her head. He&#x27;s currently undergoing gene recombination and his body temperature is over 100° C. Quick, get him to the medicated bath house. Natasha also came to her senses. She and Lynn Sharon exchanged a glance, and the two of them, one on each side, lifted Shin Yuan&#x27;s arms, trying to lift him up.</p>
<p>At this moment, under the stimulation of excruciating pain, Shinuan&#x27;s body felt as heavy as a branding iron, and he was still struggling unconsciously. The two women used all their strength to barely drag him off the operating table, and he staggered toward the medicine bath house. &quot;Hurry, my dragon&#x27;s blood tranquilizer will be ready soon.&quot; Such voice came from the pharmacy, sounding very urgent. His body was about to give out. 5 minutes later, even a miracle wouldn&#x27;t have saved him.</p>
<p>Chapter 131. Dr. Sue, are you a jinx to your husbands? President Moo, save them. Inside the medicinal bath house, steam rose, mingling with a rich medicinal aroma and a hint of ominous burnt smell. It took Natasha and Lin Char a great deal of effort to throw the burning hot and convulsing Shin Yuan into the bathtub filled with icy blue coolant.</p>
<p>Sizzle with a piercing sound like hot iron being quenched. The moment Shin Yuan&#x27;s body touched the coolant, the liquid in the entire bath began to boil at a visible speed, sending up large plumes of white steam that almost obscured everyone&#x27;s vision. Shin Yuan, don&#x27;t scare me. W Lin Sharon watched Shun Yuan struggling in the boiling medicine, her heart aching so much that tears streamed down her face like a broken string of pearls. Natasha also looked grave.</p>
<p>The energy within Shin Yuan&#x27;s body had become so violent that it had reached a critical point, like a nuclear bomb that could explode at any moment. Just then, Su Chingu rushed in, carrying a huge syringe filled with a freshly prepared viscous golden liquid. She glanced at the situation in the bathtub, her expression growing increasingly grim. It&#x27;s too late. Ordinary physical cooling methods are simply not enough to suppress the rampage of the dragon blood within him.</p>
<p>She plunged the golden dragon blood tranquilizer into Shaun Yuan&#x27;s thigh, pushing the entire vial of medicine inside. The golden potion spread through his blood vessels, finally suppressing the violent aura emanating from Shun Yuan somewhat. The terrifying crimson color on his skin also faded slightly, but he was still convulsing in pain like a fish being roasted over a fire about to be cooked at any moment. &quot;What on earth is going on?&quot; Sister Chingu Laran asked, crying. The awakening of an S-class bloodline is inherently a radical genetic reshaping process fraught with extremely high risks.</p>
<p>And what he awakened was an unparalleled doineering dragon-type bloodline. Such pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, which were fogged up with moisture, her voice tinged with frustration. His physical strength couldn&#x27;t keep up with the speed of his bloodline evolution, and his genetic chain was collapsing. She looked at Shon Yuan, who was barely alive in the bathtub, and gritted her teeth. This sedative can only delay his death for half an hour at most.</p>
<p>If he cannot find something containing extreme een energy to neutralize the extreme yong dragon energy within his body within half an hour, he will die. Die? This word left Lin Churin and Natasha in a days. A cold yet surprised and uncertain female voice came from the bathroom doorway. What are you doing? Muan Bing followed the commotion and came over. When she saw the scene in the bathroom, she froze on the spot.</p>
<p>What did she see? That scoundrel who was just moments ago full of energy and had made himself half dead with anger was now soaking in the pool like a dead dog. His whole body red and barely breathing. An utterly absurd thought surfaced in Mu Wanings mind. She blurted out something that even she herself found outrageous without thinking. Such, are you a jinx to your husbands? This sudden remark made the already tense and solemn atmosphere instantly become incredibly strange.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu, who was sweating profusely with anxiety, suddenly turned around when she saw Mu Wan Bings face, which seemed to say, &quot;You are a terrible woman. She was first stunned, and then her intelligent and beautiful eyes suddenly lit up. Yes, how could I have forgotten about her?&quot; A body chilled by a thousand colds. Isn&#x27;t this just a ready-made top tier form of extreme power? Suching face instantly brightened. She dropped the empty syringe in her hand, walked a few steps to Mu Wan Bing, and stared at her with her bright eyes as if Columbus had discovered a new continent.</p>
<p>Mu Wan Bing felt a chill run down her spine. President Mu Suchings voice was extremely serious. Do you want to completely cure the thousand cold body in your body? Mu Wam Binging heart skipped a beat. Cured? Can the strange illness that tormented her for 12 years, leaving her unable to live or die be cured? She suppressed the turmoil in her heart, maintaining a cold expression. What do you mean? My man has awakened the undying dragon blood, and his body is now full of supreme Yong dragonqi, about to explode.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xu spoke concisely and directly to the point. You are of the thousand cold body with extremely in and cold energy within your body. Now, all you need to do is go over and hug him using the cold energy within your body. Not only can it save his life, but it can also completely refine and absorb the coldness in your body with his supreme young dragon energy. From now on, you will not only be free from the torment of this strange disease, but you may even turn misfortune into blessing and gain unexpected benefits.</p>
<p>After Su Chingu finished speaking, she fell silent, only looking at her with an expression that said, &quot;Believe it or not,&quot; Mu Wamings brain was working at lightning speed. The first thought that popped into her mind was to refuse. How could Muan Bing possibly offer herself to a man, especially a scumbag she despises, just to save him? Suching next words, however, were like a heavy hammer, shattering all her pride and hesitation. Mr. Mu, I&#x27;m not discussing this with you.</p>
<p>Suching tone turned cold and hard. She pointed to Shun Yuan, whose breathing was getting weaker and weaker in the bath, and then to Mu Wan Bing. This is the only way to save him right now. and also the only way to save yourself. Your constitution already weakened by the cold worsens every year.</p>
<p>According to my calculations, the next major outbreak of cold energy will occur within half a month. At that time, no rare and precious treasures will be able to suppress it. You will be frozen solid from the inside out by the cold air within your body, turning into a human-shaped ice sculpture. They&#x27;re definitely going to die. They&#x27;re definitely going to die.</p>
<p>These four words were like four cold steel needles piercing Mu Wan Bings heart. She believes it. She believed more than anyone else that she was going to die. Over the years, she has searched for the top life scientists in the empire and even the world. And the conclusions she has reached are exactly the same as those of Su Chingu.</p>
<p>She has less than a year left to live. On one side is certain death. On the other is clinging to that scoundrel, and there&#x27;s a chance to live. She might even be able to escape the pain that had plagued her for 12 years. Between life and death, what is there to hesitate about? Dignity? Pride? In the face of death, it is worthless.</p>
<p>Mu Wanings cold, pretty face showed a constantly shifting expression. She glanced at the man in the bathtub who was almost unconscious and then at Su Chinghu, Natasha, and Lin Chur, who looked anxious. She suddenly understood. This is not a multiple choice question at all. From the moment she stepped into this room, she had no choice.</p>
<p>Good. A single word was uttered flatly from her pale lips. Under the astonished gazes of the three women, she had only one thought in her mind. Even if it can&#x27;t be completely cured, as long as we can suppress the next outbreak of cold energy and allow her to live a little longer, it will be worth it. As for that man, consider it repaying the favor he did for saving me yesterday.</p>
<p>Chapter 132. Muan Bing, the proud daughter of heaven, breaks through to the third realm of martial arts master Z. When Muan Bings exquisitly beautiful foot stepped into the boiling medicinal pool, a bizarre scene unfolded. The scalding liquid, hot enough to melt steel, did not cause any burns the moment it touched her skin. Instead, it seemed to have met its nemesis, forming a brief, still vacuum around her feet.</p>
<p>An invisible stream of extremely cold air emanated from her body, clashing and annihilating the potent Yong energy in the pool. Inside the bathroom, the steam grew thicker, making it almost impossible to see one&#x27;s hand in front of one&#x27;s face. Lyn, Sharon, and Natasha held their breath, watching nervously as the slender figure resolutely walked towards the center of the bathtub. Muan Bing gritted her teeth, ignoring the impact of the pool water on her body, and walked step by step to Shinuan. The man before me had his eyes closed, his face contorted in pain, and his skin was a frightening crimson.</p>
<p>Countless tiny beads of blood seeped from his pores only to be instantly evaporated by the intense heat. The life force within him was diminishing at an alarming rate. Without the slightest hesitation, Muan being stretched out her slightly trembling arms and wrapped them around Shin Yuan&#x27;s neck. The moment their skin touched like two extremes of ice and fire. H Muan being felt as if she had been thrown into the crater of an erupting volcano.</p>
<p>A doineering and scorching dragon aura surged wildly into her limbs and bones, flowing through every inch of her skin. That was a terrifyingly high temperature capable of burning away the soul. But at the same time, the extremely cold and een energy within her body, which had tormented her for 12 years, and had long since become one with her flesh and blood, seemed to have found an outlet. For Shin Yuan, who was on the verge of death, this extremely cold and e energy was like a life-saving spring. That cool, pure energy extinguished the dragon blood within him that was about to spiral out of control and smoothed out his nearly broken genetic chains.</p>
<p>The body, tense from the intense pain, gradually relaxed. Consciousness too, slowly regained a sliver of clarity from the chaotic darkness. The extremely cold and e energy that clung to the depths of Mu Wandings body like a maggot was being refined, absorbed, and transformed little by little by the scorching dragon energy. Mu Wings mind oscillated between extreme pain and extreme tenderness. She even forgot where she was and why she was holding this man.</p>
<p>Only one thought remained in her mind. Don&#x27;t let go. Never let go. Time passed by second by second. The medicinal liquid in the bath had long since stopped boiling.</p>
<p>Golden dragon energy and icy blue cold energy intertwined and swirled around the two, forming a huge energy vortex that emitted a hazy halo. Such standing by the pool watched the vital signs data of Shin Yuan and Mu Wan Bing on the light screen. The data gradually stabilized after initially fluctuating wildly and finally settled at a level far exceeding that of ordinary people. Her heart, which had been hanging in suspense, finally settled down. Okay, the situation is stable now.</p>
<p>She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses and announced the good news to Lynn Shurin and Natasha, who were already extremely anxious and at a loss. Call. Lin Sharon and Natasha both breathed a sigh of relief. As their tense nerves relaxed, they both felt their legs go weak. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan is all right. Lynn Sharon cried tears of joy, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. Natasha was also still shaken. She looked at the couple embracing tightly in the bathtub, her eyes filled with complex emotions. Su Ching Xu walked to the two of them and looked at Muhan Bing in the bath who had her eyes closed and her face was flushed.</p>
<p>She stretched out her arms, one on each side, and put them on Lin Churin and Natasha&#x27;s shoulders, teasingly saying, &quot;Did you see that? From today onwards, our base will have another incredibly wealthy and aloof female CEO. If you want to buy any limited edition bags or jewelry in the future, just ask her for reimbursement, don&#x27;t be polite with her. Lynn Churn blushed, feeling a little embarrassed. Natasha nodded in deep agreement. Looking at Muan Bing, she was filled with admiration for Su Chingus methods.</p>
<p>SisterQing Xu is the real master of control. Just then, a sudden change has occurred. In the center of the bath, Mu Wandings body began to tremble violently without warning. A surge of pure and more powerful icy blue energy erupted from her body. Thump.</p>
<p>The next second. In her originally empty Danteon, devoid of even a trace of chi and blood, a wisp of icy blue primordial energy radiating a bone chilling cold, was suddenly born out of thin air. This wisp of primordial energy gives rise to two. Two gives rise to four, and four gives rise to all things. In the blink of an eye, it converged into a surging icy blue stream, flowing wildly through her meridians that had just been expanded by the dragon energy.</p>
<p>A first level martial arts apprentice. No, that icy blue energy broke through the barrier of the first realm in just a few breaths and with unstoppable momentum, it rushed towards the realm of the second realm martial artist. Boom! Another muffled thud. Second realm, it&#x27;s done. Moreover, this aura is continuing to rise at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>Early stage of the second realm, the middle stage of the second realm, late stage of the second realm, three realms marshall master realm. What on earth is going on? The three women by the pool were all stunned by this miraculous scene before them. They had never heard of anyone being able to go from an ordinary person with no strength to a thirdle martial artist in just one minute. Faster than a rocket. Chapter 133.</p>
<p>The iceberg CEO is seen naked. 86 heartbeat points. Such was the first to react. She observed that Mu Wan Bings energy index was increasing exponentially at an unbelievable rate, and a terrifying light burst forth from her intelligent and beautiful eyes. Oh my god, I get it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the thousand cold physique. Her special physique, after being neutralized and refined by Shun Yuan&#x27;s Supreme Yong Dragon energy, did not disappear directly. Instead, it returned to its original state and became a top tier cultivation talent. The extremely cold and een energy that had accumulated within her body for 12 years was her largest energy reserve. These energies are now being unleashed.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t cultivating. She was simply reclaiming the power that rightfully belonged to her. Suching explanation refreshed Lin Sharon and Natasha&#x27;s understanding of the world once again. So, getting sick can actually give birth to a top-notch talent. Meanwhile, Muan Bing, who was in the bath, finally came to her senses after the intense pleasure of her breakthrough.</p>
<p>She felt the unprecedented surging and pure icy power within her body and felt the pain that had plagued her for 12 years rapidly receding. A surge of euphoria, a thirst for power quickly overwhelmed her remaining sanity. It works. It really works. The man&#x27;s treatment was 10,000 times more effective than she had imagined.</p>
<p>This is hardly a treatment. This is clearly divine intervention. It&#x27;s a complete transformation. Her heart, which had been frozen for many years, melted away. Looking at the man in her arms, who had taken a huge advantage of her, but also given her a new life, a complex emotion surfaced in her cold, beautiful eyes, she wanted to take back all the pain and despair she had endured over the past 12 years from this man.</p>
<p>With interest, Su Ching Xu nodded with satisfaction at the sight of her throwing herself into her arms. Done. She turned around and helplessly shrugged at Lynn, Churin, and Natasha, who were still in a daysaze. It seems this treatment won&#x27;t be over anytime soon. You go first and find a clean set of clothes for our new sister.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t exactly let her walk out naked later, can we? Naked. Lyn, Sharon, and Natasha were taken aback upon hearing this and subconsciously looked towards the bathtub. Upon seeing this, the two girls blushed instantly and quickly turned their heads away. Ah, we&#x27;ll go right now. Lynn Sharan covered her face, grabbed the equally stunned Natasha, and ran out of the bathroom as if fleeing.</p>
<p>In the bathroom, Such Chingu looked at the energy curve on the light screen, which had already broken through to the peak of the second realm and was still pushing towards the mid-stage barrier of the third realm. The cunning smile on her lips became even brighter, truly worthy of the physique of a thousand colds. The potential is astounding. She glanced again at Shun Yuan, who was once again in a passive healing state due to Muan Bings extreme in energy, and a trace of sympathy flashed in her eyes. Poor man.</p>
<p>Having just escaped one tiger&#x27;s den, they entered another. But Su Ching Xus eyes gleamed with eager anticipation. Once he has fully absorbed Mu Wanings extreme een and cold energy and awakened the undying dragon blood, how terrifying will his body evolve to? At that time, could I hold an even grander academic seminar with him? In the medicinal bath, the rising steam finally began to show signs of dissipating. As the pool water went from boiling to calming down, the intertwined golden dragon energy and icy blue chill gradually disappeared. Shin Yuan&#x27;s consciousness broke free from a scorching inferno and slowly rose upwards.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and a pair of fiery golden vertical pupils met a pair of eyes that had also just opened but with an icy blue halo and they suddenly met within inches. It&#x27;s Muan Bing. He remembered that just before his genetic chain collapsed and he was about to be burst apart by the raging dragon blood, it was this woman who with her chilling aura pulled him back from the brink of death. At this moment, the woman in front of him was completely different from the aloof cold-blooded Sio. he remembered.</p>
<p>Her flawless oval face was flushed with a captivating blush, and her once icy eyes were now hazy with a hint of bewilderment at her first taste of power. Shin Yuans gaze drifted involuntarily. Mu Wan Bing finally snapped out of the strange feeling of that surge of power. She looked down and saw herself. Then she saw him.</p>
<p>A dash. A short, sharp scream filled with shame and indignation shattered the ambiguous tranquility of the bathroom. Muan Bing released her arms as if she had been electrocuted, and without thinking, she wanted to escape from Shun Yuan&#x27;s embrace. However, her body, which had just broken through to the middle stage of the third realm, had not yet fully adapted to that surging power. Coupled with the weakness and soreness caused by the dragon energy, she stumbled and fell back down.</p>
<p>With a thud, she crashed solidly into the arms of the man who had just saved her and taken advantage of her immensely. Are you all right? Shinuan felt the icy beauty in his arms and subconsciously reached out to support her. She stood frozen in place, too afraid to move, feeling as if all the blood in her body was rushing to her face, and she felt like she was about to be cooked. Mr. Moo, the clothes have arrived.</p>
<p>Just then, Lynn, Churin, and Natasha peaked in carrying a clean set of women&#x27;s combat uniforms. When they saw the scene in the bathtub, they both turned around immediately. Muam Bing seemed to have grasped the lifeline. She pushed Shun Yuan aside, rushed out of the bathtub as fast as she could, snatched the clothes from Lin Chars hands, and with her back to everyone, quickly put them on in an almost disheveled manner. As she buttoned her clothes without turning her head, she said in a cold tone that seemed to feain composure, &quot;Shin yuan, you saved me yesterday and today, I&#x27;m repaying you.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re even now.&quot; After saying that, she didn&#x27;t even glance at the crowd and walked straight out of the bathroom. That tall, straight back still carried a hint of the aloofness of a female CEO, but her bright red ears and slightly stiff gate betrayed the unease in her heart. Chapter 134. The eight realms candle dragon was so scared he wet himself as Shin Yuan watched her fleeing figure. The system notification sounded in his mind.</p>
<p>Ding. Target Mu Wan being detected. Heart rate has reached 86%. 86%. Shinyan grinn.</p>
<p>This is far from a clean break. It&#x27;s clearly just the beginning. He stood up from the bath, feeling the surging dragon energy within his body, more than 10 times stronger than before, and the powerful physical body that had been transformed after awakening the S-level undying dragon blood. Wow, no wonder he has such a robust constitution. This tonic is really potent.</p>
<p>What? You&#x27;re satisfied with that? Such had entered at some point. She leaned against the door frame, looking with great interest at Shun Yuan&#x27;s near-perfect body and the faint golden dragon scale patterns that appeared on his skin due to the awakening of his bloodline. The curve of her lips grew increasingly sinister. That Mr. Moo from earlier was clearly all bark and no bite.</p>
<p>Cold on the outside, but sly on the inside. If you chased after her now, cornered her against the wall, and gave her a rather forceful treatment, I guarantee she wouldn&#x27;t last even half a minute. At that time, let alone a Celestial Industries, she would be happy to give birth to a whole football team for you.&quot; Such words gave Lin Churin and Natasha, who were still in shock, a completely new understanding of her runchy remarks. Shinuan smiled, but did not reply. He knew, of course, that what Su Ching Xu said was true.</p>
<p>To deal with a woman like Muan Bing, one had to act swiftly and decisively. But now is not the time. Woo woo dash. Just then, the highest level alarm that had just subsided inside the base suddenly blared out again, piercingly loud. It was more urgent and more desperate than before.</p>
<p>Donai City, a great wall of flesh and blood. After a brief period of advantage, the battle situation took another sharp turn for the worse. Roar dash. A terrifying roar, seemingly capable of shattering the soul, boomed from behind the endless tide of beasts from the dark depths of the sea. The Black Sea surface suddenly bulged upwards.</p>
<p>The next second, a terrifying giant wave thousands of meters high and blotting out the sky was stirred up from the deep sea by an unparalleled force. Those weren&#x27;t waves at all. It is a moving water barrier made of trillions of tons of seaater, enough to flatten the entire Donghai city off the map. At the top of that giant wave, a terrifying silhouette over 10,000 m long and engulfed in molten crimson flames finally revealed its massive form to the world for the first time. Eastern candle dragon.</p>
<p>After observing for 4 days, this calamity level star beast at the peak of the eighth realm lost all patience. It will personally take action to completely submerge this ant-like city that dares to challenge its majesty. Finished. On the city wall, all the soldiers who witness this scene wore expressions of deathly despair. Faced with such devastating power, human strength appears so insignificant and laughable.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation, the highest command center, Leon looked at the apocalyptic scene on the main screen. Her body swayed and she almost lost her balance. All combat units must immediately abandon the outer defensive line. Retreat to the second line. She hadn&#x27;t finished speaking.</p>
<p>A melodious female voice, cold and indifferent, yet imbued with supreme authority, interrupted her. No need. Donghai City, 10,000 m above the ground. The exquisite war goddess, who had been standing quietly in the clouds, also made a move. Her exquisite crimson armor burst forth with an extremely dazzling light.</p>
<p>At this moment, a fierce fighting spirit ignited in those in different Phoenix eyes. Even if the opponent is stronger than himself, Julong, who is at the peak of the eighth realm, she wasn&#x27;t entirely confident that she could stop this crazed beast. But as an eighth realm marshall emperor of the human race, she would never back down even a step. Just as Euing Long gathered all her energy, preparing to fight to the death against the devastating tsunami. However, at that moment, a sudden change has occurred.</p>
<p>The eastern candle dragon, which had already unleashed a thousand meter high wave and was about to destroy everything, suddenly froze, its massive mountain-like body. A hint of confusion appeared in its massive lava-like eyes. Immediately following was surprise and disbelief. Finally, there is the throbbing that comes from the deepest part of one&#x27;s blood. It turned its ferocious dragon head, and its huge eyes, which were comparable to lakes, stared in the direction of the East Sea military region base.</p>
<p>There it is. A completely new and terrifying aura, unlike anything it had ever felt before, was awakening at an alarming speed. That aura was also from a dragon. But its bloodline, though not yet fully developed, was nobler and more ancient than that of the so-called candle dragon. Besides the woman in the sky, is there some other terrifying being lurking in this city? Zhuongs mind, which had been clouded by rage, instantly cleared up considerably.</p>
<p>Its action, which had stirred up towering waves, came to an abrupt halt. The black tsunami, powerful enough to engulf the entire city, slowly receded before the horrified eyes of all the survivors. The next second, the massive body of the candle dragon, which was tens of thousands of meters long, turned around and plunged into the bottomless, dark abyss without the slightest hesitation, disappearing without a trace. With its departure, the endless beast tide seemed to lose its backbone, becoming chaotic, and its offensive power greatly reduced. That cataclysmic beast tide actually retreated just like that.</p>
<p>on the city wall. The soldiers who had just been waiting to die stared blankly at the unbelievable scene before them, their minds completely blank. It took more than 10 seconds before anyone reacted. Refund. The beast tide has receded.</p>
<p>We won. We won. A thunderous roar of cheers echoed throughout the entire East China Sea defense line. Countless soldiers threw down their weapons and embraced their comrades, weeping with joy. The overwhelming joy of surviving the disaster set the entire city ablaze.</p>
<p>However, 10,000 meters above the ground. Euling Long looked at the sea, which had returned to calm, her beautiful face, usually so indifferent, now showing a deep sense of gravity and confusion. She knew very well that the dragon hadn&#x27;t been scared away by her at all. Its fear, but what is it afraid of? Yu Ling Longs divine sense, like an invisible tide, instantly covered the entire Dongghai city. She seemed to sense the source of that fleeting, terrifying aura that even the candle dragon feared.</p>
<p>An idea that she herself found utterly absurd quietly formed in her mind. Could it be that overwhelming pressure which even frightened a peak level star beast of the eighth realm originated from the highest level of the bloodline? Was it that man with only F-level talent who caused this? Chapter 135. The candle dragon has retreated. No, it has simply moved on to a new target. Inside the highest command center of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, a deafening roar of cheers nearly lifted the alloy ceiling.</p>
<p>However, amidst the jubilant atmosphere of surviving a disaster, Lie Yun and Xiao Jingwa showed no sign of relief. Something&#x27;s not right. Lie Yun stared at the now calm black sea on the holographic screen, her eyes filled with semnity. activate the Abyss I3 probe immediately. Power it to maximum.</p>
<p>Scan every corner of that sea area. As soon as she gave the command, an invisible quantum beam shot into the deep sea. Soon, a completely new scene, one that made everyone gasp in astonishment, appeared on the main screen. That 10,000 m long eastern candle dragon has not left at all. It simply submerged into the pitch black trench tens of thousands of meters below the surface.</p>
<p>Its enormous body lay coiled on the seabed, and its pair of lava-like giant eyes peered intently into the direction of Dongghai City through the endless darkness and seawater. It was like a highly patient top tier hunter, observing, waiting, and assessing the true nature of its kind, which even made its heart pound. The danger is far from over. Just then, a clear, ethereal female voice, seemingly not of this world, rang out in Lean&#x27;s mind. Lean, please explain.</p>
<p>She is the exquisite war goddess. Lean&#x27;s heart tightened and she dared not be negligent in the slightest. She immediately reported everything that had just happened in the base as well as her speculations through the mental link. Therefore, I speculate that Shin Yuan had just awakened his S-rank dragon bloodline and the highle bloodline pressure that erupted at that moment caused Zuong to misjudge, thinking that there was another top level existence in the city that was no weaker than you. So, he temporarily retreated.</p>
<p>10,000 meters above the ground. After listening to Lie&#x27;s report, Yu Lings beautiful face, shrouded in divine light, showed an even deeper sense of confusion. A martial artist at the third realm who has just awakened his S-class bloodline. Did it scare away a calamity level beast emperor who was at the peak of the eighth realm and about to enter the ninth realm? This was even more outrageous than any legend she had ever heard. This candle dragon is not only terrifyingly powerful, but its intelligence also far surpasses that of other star beasts.</p>
<p>Leon&#x27;s voice rang out again, filled with apprehension. It&#x27;s just testing the waters now. Once it discovers that the owner of that aura is far less powerful than it imagined, it&#x27;ll realize that Leian didn&#x27;t say anything more, but the consequences were self-evident. Inside the laboratory, Shin Yuan was immersed in the immense joy of his sudden surge in strength. He had even begun to plan how to make a grand entrance and under the spotlight crush those troublesome star beasts on the spot.</p>
<p>Let longing, let L Yu, let everyone in Dong Hai City see that Shun Yuan is not a good for nothing who only hides behind women just as he was about to unleash the immense undying dragon blood power within him and go out to show off his incredible skills. Shinuan, immediately conceal all your aura. Do not let even the slightest trace leak out. Lie Yians urgent distorted voice boomed in his ears through the communicator. Shin Yuan was stunned on the spot.</p>
<p>No, sister Lee, what are you doing? Wasn&#x27;t that serpent scared away? I feel perfectly fine now. It&#x27;s time for me to go out and display my might, bringing glory to the empire. Fart. Leun immediately cursed. It didn&#x27;t run away.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s lying right in front of our house. That beast has its eyes on you now. Leun quickly relayed her analysis and the current crisis to Shinuan. To them, star beasts with superior bloodlines are the most precious natural treasures. Devouring just one is more beneficial than they could gain from hundreds of years of arduous cultivation.</p>
<p>That candle dragon is now craving your S-rank undying dragon blood. The reason it hasn&#x27;t moved is simply because it&#x27;s unsure just how strong you are. Once it realizes that you are merely a fourthle cultivator, it will spare no effort to storm the base and devour you alive. At that time, even if ElderQin himself came, let alone the goddess of War Ling Long, he might not be able to save you in time, Shinuan was completely dumbfounded after hearing this. After all that, it turned out to be a strategic weapon that had become a strategic piece of Tangan Xangs flesh, a metaphor for easy prey.</p>
<p>And it was even the kind of thing that was delivered right to the mouth of a monster. Looking at the terrifying outline that was faintly visible in the deep sea on the light screen, Shin Yuan felt a chill in his lower back for no reason. However, this coolness was quickly replaced by another, more primal urge. He recalled one of the three characteristics of his immortal dragon blood. The dragons devour.</p>
<p>Devour everything and make it your own blood. The stronger the pulse, the more it doubles the absorption effect. He subconsciously licked his dry lips and a golden flame, even more greedy than the candle dragon, ignited in his dark eyes that had just returned to normal. As he stared at the colossal figure, tens of thousands of meters long on the screen, the first thought that popped into his mind was this giant spicy snack, if grilled, would probably last a long time, right? It&#x27;s still uncertain who will eat whom. What? Judging from your expression, you&#x27;re still not full.</p>
<p>Such had come over again at some point. Her beautiful eyes, hidden behind her gold- rimmed glasses, looked Shun Yuan up and down with a playful smile. Are they still savoring the taste of that aloof CEO from earlier? Or are they already thinking about who to replace him with next? Her words were like a feather, precisely scratching the tip of Shun Yuan&#x27;s heart. Shin Yuan snapped out of his days, grabbed her slender waist, and pulled her into his arms. His nose was filled with that familiar intellectual scent, a mixture of medicine and a fragrance of a woman.</p>
<p>He lowered his head, breathed hot air into her ear, and whispered in a highly aggressive horse voice, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Dr. Sue. The next guinea pig to collapse on the operating table will definitely be you. I guarantee I&#x27;ll let you study my jeans thoroughly inside and out.&quot; The delicate body in his arms trembled slightly. Instead of pushing him away, Su Chingu took the initiative to stretch out her arms and wrap them around his neck.</p>
<p>Her beautiful eyes, which shown with rationality, were filled with a crazy desire to explore and an invitation. I&#x27;ll be waiting for you anytime, my dear experimental subject. She now has an unprecedented interest in studying Shun Yuan&#x27;s perfect body, which has just completed the S-level bloodline awakening, and whose physical strength and total blood volume have increased several times over. Shinyuan gave her a light peck on her full red lips, then released her. However, before that, a hunter smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>A smile that sent chills down Su Ching Xus spine. I need to feed the other one first, a noble countest with a figure score of 99, who is eagerly waiting to be fed. After saying that, he ignored the women behind him with their various expressions, and walked straight toward the underground solitary confinement room. Since we can&#x27;t go out to fight monsters and level up for the time being, let&#x27;s first stay in the newbie village and fight all the bosses we can. Chapter 136.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan and the Countess mutually attracted. The Beast Tide&#x27;s offensive weakened considerably as the Candle Dragon lay in wait. With the pressure on the defensive line greatly reduced under Lean&#x27;s command, the various units began to retreat in shifts, shrinking the defensive line while maintaining the highest level of vigilance. 10,000 m above the ground, Yuing Longs figure slowly descended and landed on the rooftop of the command center. She decided to stay in the East Sea for the time being and personally oversee the situation to prevent the cunning Xong from launching another surprise attack.</p>
<p>After handing over command of their respective defense zones to the captain of the Dragon Slayer squad, Ling and Lung Yu, exhausted, returned to the Umbrella Corporation headquarters. As soon as they entered the hall, the two saw Su Ching Xu holding a tablet computer recording some data. Su Ching Zhu also saw them. She put down the tablet, slowly stood up, and unconsciously straightened her slender hands, which were covered in white gloves, revealing a dignified yet proud smile like that of a victor. That look seemed to say, &quot;See, you&#x27;re fighting to the death outside while I&#x27;m just conducting research inside, and I&#x27;ve changed the entire course of the battle.&quot; L Yings icy pretty face instantly turned even colder.</p>
<p>Although she also gained tremendous benefits from that 5% increase in genetic potential and even faintly touched the threshold of the mid-stage of the fifth realm. But one thing at a time, she just couldn&#x27;t stand Su Ching Xus cold-blooded attitude, treating men, feelings, and even national righteousness as experimental data. Don&#x27;t look at me like that, instructor Long. Su Ching Zhu pushed up her glasses, the corners of her mouth curving into an even more amused smile. Admit it, my contribution is greater than your brute strength.</p>
<p>You, Lyings fist clenched instantly, just as the atmosphere between the two was about to become tense again. A clear, cold voice interrupted their standoff. What about him? Yuing Long had appeared at the entrance of the hall without anyone noticing. Her indifferent Phoenix eyes swept over the three women present, finally settling on Su Ching Zhu. Su Ching Xu bowed slightly to this eighth realm marshall emperor who was a national level expert.</p>
<p>Her face still bearing that calm and intellectual smile. Reporting to the goddess of war, Ling Long, she extended her slender finger and pointed towards the underground confinement room, speaking slowly in a calm tone as if reporting on the progress of an experiment. Our Mr. Shun is currently carrying out a strategic level subversion mission that is even more important than fighting the beast tide. The target is Akasha von Rothschild, the first in line to the throne of the Rothschild family in the Free Commonwealth.</p>
<p>deepest underground outside the highest level of confinement. Lein watched the stunningly beautiful countest on the monitor screen, elegantly enjoying a top quality steak and red wine with a brand new set of table wear and felt a throbbing pain in her temples. She really went on a hunger strike for two whole days just for this outfit. Leun rubbed her temples, her tone full of helplessness. A female agent standing nearby nodded with a ry smile.</p>
<p>Yes, sisterly. She said she&#x27;d rather starve than not be able to wear decent clothes. She also said that if she died here, the Rothschild family would make us pay an unimaginable price. Damn it, we&#x27;ve really brought back a patriarch. Leun couldn&#x27;t help but mutter under her breath.</p>
<p>This Akasha&#x27;s identity is too sensitive. We can&#x27;t hit her. We can&#x27;t scold her. And we absolutely can&#x27;t let anything happen to her. Unfortunately, this woman is someone who won&#x27;t listen to reason or pressure.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 days, we&#x27;ve tried every interrogation method imaginable, but she&#x27;s completely unmoved, as if she&#x27;s on vacation in her own backyard. Finally, having no other choice, Leun reluctantly had her black velvet dress, which had been damaged in the battle, sent overnight to the capital to be repaired by the top tailor and then airlifted back to her. Fine, fine. Let her be smug for a while longer. Leun waved her hand, saying that when that kid arrived, she would have her day to cry.</p>
<p>As they were talking, the heavy alloy door leading to the solitary confinement room slowly opened. Shinyuan strode in with confident steps. Inside the confinement room, the cold metallic scent has long been replaced by the rich aroma of wine and high-end perfumes. Akasha sat on the cold metal edge of the bed. Her posture is elegant as if she were sitting on the throne of Versailles.</p>
<p>She was wearing the perfectly restored black velvet gown adorned with subtle patterns and shimmering with iridescent light. The extreme black made her already fair skin appear even more delicate and snow white as if it were glowing. Beneath the skirt, a pair of impossibly long legs encased in pristine black lace stockings were casually crossed, and the bright red high heels on her feet stood out starkly against the cold white light. Her long, wavy, wine red hair cascaded down her shoulders like a waterfall, and a lazy yet playful smile graced her breathtakingly beautiful face. When she saw Shin Yuan push open the door and enter, her deep violet eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>As if a hunter who had been waiting for a long time had finally seen his most desired prey. Something about him seems different. It&#x27;s still that outrageously handsome face and that same nonchalant attitude. But Akasha keenly sensed that the aura emanating from him had changed. If the previous Shinuan was a peerless jade encased in a stubborn rock, it needed to be unearthed and polished.</p>
<p>So now he is a divine weapon that has been unshathed and has drunk the blood of dragons. That doineering scorching aura originating from the deepest part of one&#x27;s bloodline. It tastes even better now. This was the first thought that popped into Akasha&#x27;s mind. The moment Shun Yuan saw Akasha, the blood in his body began to rush uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The S-rank undying dragon blood while granting him a powerful physique and boundless dragon energy also brought a minor side effect that is the almost instinctive desire to conquer and possess top tier members of the opposite sex originating from the deepest part of the dragon bloodline especially when facing a peerless beauty like Akasha who stands at the very top of the pyramid in terms of bloodline appearance figure and status. This impulse was amplified 10fold 100fold. Chapter 137. Pressure on Akasha. The cruel truth of the family.</p>
<p>The air in the confined room seemed to freeze along with a faint ambiguous scent that mingled with the rich aroma of red wine and the scent of expensive cosmetics. Shinuan stood half a step in front of Akasha, stealing that long desired. However, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, the anticipated frenzy did not occur. Although the two golden flames in Shun Yuans eyes were terrifyingly hot, he did not move. Treat.</p>
<p>The light in Akashas eyes dimmed for a moment. Disappointment. Extreme disappointment. She gritted her teeth, her queenly arrogance making her want to utter a few sarcastic remarks. What? Our sir, are you all lustful but lack the courage? Or is it that your so-called S-class bloodline? What&#x27;s the rush? Shinuan laughed.</p>
<p>A laugh that was both roguish and chillingly sinister. Tsk tsk tsk. It was like a rare piece of porcelain, prompting heartfelt admiration. He took a step back, pulled over the only metal chair next to him, and sat down with an air of authority. He crossed his legs, lit a cigarette he&#x27;d somehow produced, took a deep drag, and then exhaled the pale blue smoke all over Akasha&#x27;s bewildered face.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m thinking about a question. Through the smoke, Shinuan looked at Akasha, who was coughing lightly from the smoke. The infatuation on his face vanished instantly, replaced by a cold and mocking look that seemed to see through everything. Akasha von Rothschild. If you were imprisoned for the rest of your life in this dark, sunless underground depths dozens of meters below the surface.</p>
<p>Your noble status, your power to command the wind and rain, your peak strength at the fifth realm, and your beauty that you were so proud of have all become decorations, turning you into trash who can only admire yourself in this small room. Are you really willing to accept this? Akasha&#x27;s alluring expression stiffened slightly, but she quickly recovered and put on a nonchalant expression again. She picked up the red wine on the table, took an elegant sip, and her purple eyes revealed a perfectly measured hint of langor and disdain. Are you willing to accept this? Why wouldn&#x27;t you be willing? She put down her wine glass, leaned forward, and shifted her beautiful legs, creating a fragrant breeze. There is food and drink here.</p>
<p>When my children are born, they will naturally inherit my will and may even surpass me. At that time, the whole world will still belong to the Rothschild family. As for freedom, she chuckled softly, sticking out the tip of her scarlet tongue and licking her lips. In this room, aren&#x27;t you and I the freest people? Haha. Shinuan seemed to have heard the biggest joke in the world, and suddenly burst into a shrill, maniacal laugh.</p>
<p>Laughter echoed in the cramped solitary confinement cell, making Akasha&#x27;s eardrums ache. Why are you laughing? Akasha&#x27;s face darkened. The feeling of being mocked like a fool reignited her anger. I laugh at your naivity. I laugh at your selfdeception.</p>
<p>I laugh at you still dreaming even as you face death. Shin Yuan stopped laughing, leaned forward, and stared intently at Akasha with his golden vertical pupils as if trying to pierce through all her pretenses. What are you pretending for, Akasha? Do you think your family will soon put pressure on Lia? Do you think the Federation&#x27;s fleet will soon be at your doorstep in the East China Sea? Do you think your powerful father will spare no effort to save you? Akasha&#x27;s heart skipped a beat, but she forced a cold smile. I am the first in line to the family throne. My value is irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Of course, they will save me. Value? Shin Yuan&#x27;s lips curled into a cruel smile. For an heir who has already become a prisoner and may even have been turned or ruined by the enemy. Do you think those profit-driven capitalists will still think you have value? I have some bad news for you. Shin Yuan flicked his cigarette ash, his tone casual yet as powerful as a thunderclap.</p>
<p>The day after you were arrested, your distant aunt, Miss Katarina, took over all of the blood rose&#x27;s intelligence network and armed forces as acting clan leader. What? Akasha&#x27;s wine glass fell to the ground with a crash and shattered into pieces. The scarlet wine splattered on her expensive red sold high heels looking like a pool of glaring blood. Impossible. How dare that Katarina? Father will not allow her to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Your father? Shinuan sneer deepened. Your father is probably busy dealing with the elders council&#x27;s impeachment proceedings right now. After all, sending his best daughter into the enemy&#x27;s headquarters and sacrificing the entire intelligence network of the East China Sea was a huge strategic blunder. and the first thing your aunt did wasn&#x27;t to send someone to rescue you. Instead, they sent a strongly worded protest letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Langia.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan mimicked that official tone and said sarcastically. If Ms. Akasha is not released immediately, the Rothschild family will consider it a declaration of war. Tsk tsk tsk, listen to that, how doineering. But in reality, this letter serves no purpose other than angering the Long Sha military and making your situation here even more difficult.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s using someone else to do her dirty work. She&#x27;s forcing us to kill you or to lock you up here forever. As long as you can&#x27;t go back, the future queen of the Rothschild family will be her. Katarina Akasha&#x27;s body trembled violently, her nails digging deeply into her palms. She&#x27;s not stupid.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she was smarter than anyone else and understood better than anyone else the ruthless power struggles within the family. Every word Shin Yuan spoke was like a sharp knife, precisely dissecting the fear she least wanted to face in her heart. Katarina&#x27;s aunt, who was always jealous of her beauty and talent and was kind on the surface, but vicious behind the scenes, was absolutely capable of doing such a thing. If they lose the support of their family, if they lose their status as heirs. Chapter 138.</p>
<p>Akasha calls the dragon lord. So what if it is like this? Akasha was still making a lastditch effort. As long as I can escape, as long as I return to the Federation with my strength and skills, I can get back everything I&#x27;ve lost. Take it back. Shinyuan stood up and approached her step by step, forcing her to retreat until she finally collapsed onto the bed.</p>
<p>He looked down at her, his voice like a devil&#x27;s whisper. What are you taking? You are now a prisoner. Even if we were to show you mercy and release you, what do you think would become of a deposed crown prince who has lost all power and carries the stain of being captured? You will be stripped of all power. You will become a victim of an arranged marriage. Perhaps it will be given to some bloated, obese arms tycoon with peculiar fetishes as a play thing in exchange for a new arms purchase contract.</p>
<p>Or Shin Yuan reached out and lifted her trembling chin, looking into her eyes, which were filled with fear. They would be given to that old monster of the ninth realm in the Federation who was said to be over 200 years old whose body was almost rotting yet who was still extremely leerous to be his furnace in order to continue the family&#x27;s glory. After all, your body is the best of the best. No. Akasha let out a piercing scream.</p>
<p>She covered her head with her hands, curled up on the bed, trembling. The scenes Shin Yuan described were so realistic and terrifying for her who was proud and arrogant. always regarded men as play things and aspired to become a queen. That kind of ending would be a thousand times worse than death. Looking at the countess in front of him, who was on the verge of losing her mind, Shinuan knew that the time was right.</p>
<p>He suppressed his murderous aura and sat back down next to Akasha. He reached out and gently put his arm around her shoulder, pulling her into his embrace. Actually, we don&#x27;t need to make it like this. Shin Yuans voice became gentle, carrying a strange, alluring quality. Akasha, you should know that we share a common goal.</p>
<p>You crave my genes, want to give birth to the most perfect child, and want to build your own empire. And I, Shinuan, lowered his head and whispered in her ear. I also hope you can have children for me. Many, many children with the strongest talents. I can even help you.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll help you reclaim everything that belongs to you. help you get rid of that aunt who wants to take your place and help you become the true queen of the Rothschild family. Akasha suddenly raised her head in a fanatical light like that of a drowning person grasping at a straw burst forth in her crimson purple eyes. Are you serious? Certainly. Shun Yuan smiled confidently.</p>
<p>And at this moment, the bloodline aura of sle dragon blood on his body was released without reservation. You&#x27;ve seen it too, my potential, my bloodline. As long as you cooperate with me, as long as you become my woman, there is nothing in this world that we cannot do. But Shinuan abruptly changed the subject, his gaze becoming incredibly sharp. All of this is contingent on you having to put away your ridiculous little schemes.</p>
<p>Whether she wanted to become the queen of the Federation or wanted to have a sperm donor, you must truly submit to me. It&#x27;s not about physical indifference. It&#x27;s about surrendering to the soul. I want you to be my woman, not a business partner who&#x27;s always scheming against me. Can you do it? Akasha stared blankly at Shinuan, looking into the burning ambition in this man&#x27;s eyes and feeling the doineering bloodline emanating from him that made her want to submit.</p>
<p>At that moment, she suddenly realized how ridiculous she had been before. She was always looking for a man who was worthy of her, a strong man who could give her hope. And isn&#x27;t this man right in front of you now? If it were him and she were to have a child with a man like that, it doesn&#x27;t seem like something that&#x27;s hard to accept. It&#x27;s even a kind of honor. Ding.</p>
<p>Target. Akasha&#x27;s psychological defenses have completely collapsed. Her submission value has increased significantly. Submission value plus 25%. Current total progress 85%.</p>
<p>The system notification sounded in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind like heavenly music. Although it hasn&#x27;t reached 100%, this 85% submission value is enough to explain everything. She was no longer the high and mighty countess, but a powerful woman who longed to be possessed, to have power, and to turn her life around. The panic in Akasha&#x27;s eyes slowly subsided, replaced by a gentleness and a plea that was more fervent and pure than before. A captivating blush appeared on that stunningly beautiful face, Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>This was the first time she had willingly uttered that name. As long as you can help me get back everything that belongs to me. As long as you can give me the perfect child. Everything I, Akasha, have belongs to you, including my body, my soul, and the entire Rothschild family. Looking at the queen in his arms, who had finally lowered her noble head.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans lips curled into a cruel smile. Now that we&#x27;ve won the psychological battle, what&#x27;s next? It&#x27;s time to enjoy the spoils of war. Very good. Shin Yuan&#x27;s large hand slid down her silky smooth back. Akashas eyes gleamed with allure.</p>
<p>Since you&#x27;re being so good, I can&#x27;t be stingy. Shinyuan scooped her up in his arms. After being hungry for so many days, it&#x27;s time to give you a good meal of meat. Akashan nestled in his arms, listening to his vulgar words, and felt a surge of excitement. The dragon lord must feed me well.</p>
<p>I have a very big appetite. with a dull thud as something heavy hit the ground. The priceless black velvet dress like a black petal traced an arc through the air before landing on the cold ground. Next came the pair of red high heels. The lights in the confinement room seemed to have become ambiguous.</p>
<p>Chapter 139 Abyss&#x27;s mental transformation, the noble countesses for full hours. This speciallyesed solitary confinement cell, touted as having the highest level of defense within the Umbrella Corporation and capable of imprisoning a Grandmaster of the Fifth Realm, underwent a baptism even more violent than a beast tide. The air was filled with a rich aroma of top quality red wine, expensive perfume, and strong hormones, so intense it was almost palpable. The luxurious bed used for interrogating prisoners was in complete disarray, as if it had just been hit by a category 12 typhoon. Shinuan leaned against the headboard, his bare upper body showing smooth and firm muscle lines.</p>
<p>The faint golden dragon scale patterns on his skin flickered with his breath, radiating a heart palpitating heat. In his arms, the federal countis who had been so arrogant not long ago was curled up. Akasha von Rothschild. The blood rose, renowned throughout the Federation for her beauty and feared by countless nobles, was now lazily resting on Shun Yuan&#x27;s chest. On that stunningly beautiful face, capable of captivating all, the once exquisite makeup had been smudged, yet it exuded an even more alluring natural charm.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stretched out his left hand, his fingertips tracing the elegant lines of her swan-like back, casually sliding down until they stopped on her beautiful face, still flushed. It has to be said that this woman&#x27;s assets are indeed frighteningly abundant. Even in this unguarded state, the aristocratic air ingrained in her bones still lingered. Her face was so beautiful that there wasn&#x27;t a single flaw. The charm in her eyes and brows was the sweetness of a ripe peach.</p>
<p>So sweet that it seemed to drip with juice if you pinched it. Call. Akasha felt the warmth of the large hand on her cheek and subconsciously rubbed against Shinuan&#x27;s palm. Looking at her docsel appearance, Shin Yuan felt his desire to conquer was greatly satisfied. TSK, just as I expected, he sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>The women of this federation are the complete opposite of the reserved and demure women here. Whether it was the former top agent Natasha or the noble countess in her arms, they both possessed a wild, admiring nature. Before they were tamed, they were the wildest horses on the grasslands. And even the slightest touch would send them flying. But once you show your true strength, they will instantly become the most passionate partners.</p>
<p>Ding. Target. Akasha has developed a strong dependence on the host. Submission value has increased significantly. Submission value plus 4%.</p>
<p>Current total progress 89%. Shin Yuan raised his head, his gaze passing over Akasha&#x27;s smooth head and fixed on the ceiling of the cramped solitary confinement cell, his eyes gradually becoming deep and fervent. From being ridiculed for awakening his F-rank talent to now it&#x27;s only been a month. That ordinary boy who could only stare blankly at the back of the goddess on campus and awakened his F-level talent as a good for nothing is now about to embrace all the most beautiful women in the world. Lynn Sharon, the pure and beautiful school beauty, was his first love and the softest white moonlight in his heart.</p>
<p>The blonde bombshell Natasha, once a thorny black rose, has now plucked her thorns and obediently conceived his child. The future Valkyrie Long Ying, who was once an insurmountable snow mountain, has now been melted into a gentle touch by him. Su Ching Zhu, the scientific research goddess, was a rational madwoman, but she completely succumbed to his experiments. And now, this federal countis wields immense power and wealth. These are things he would never have dared to dream of before.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan&#x27;s hand tightened suddenly, gripping Akasha&#x27;s rounded shoulder. These women are not merely tools for the system to generate rewards for him. They are living, breathing people, stunning beauties with flesh and blood, and now they all belong to Shun Yuan alone. Good luck, system. Shun Yuan silently recited the name that had changed his destiny, and the two golden flames in his eyes burned brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>Since God gave him this advantage, this body that can evolve infinitely, he can&#x27;t waste it. He wanted more than just a few women, and he didn&#x27;t want to live a secluded life as a wealthy landowner. He wants 99% of all the beauties in the world to be his. He wants to use the systems power to spread his bloodline to its fullest extent and create an invincible legion composed of god-level offspring. He will step over the corpses of the Federation and the Beastmen to become the sole overlord of this blue planet.</p>
<p>And he, Shiny Yuan, will be the strongest person who stands at the pinnacle of all living beings, looking down on everything. Boom! As if sensing the extreme ambition in its master&#x27;s heart, the S-level undying dragon blood that had just awakened in Shun Yuan&#x27;s body began to boil. A terrifying doineering pressure originating from the very top of one&#x27;s bloodline erupted from Shin Yuan in this confined space. In that instant, his pupils, which were originally as black as ink, transformed into a dazzling and pure gold color at a speed visible to the naked eye. Those are not human eyes.</p>
<p>Those are dragon eyes. A pair of eyes belonging to an apex predator, noble, aloof, and disdainful of the world, as if all things in the world were merely food before these eyes. Akasha, who was closest to him, was the first to be hit, and her whole body trembled violently, as if she had been struck by a high voltage current. She looked up in alarm, only to be met with Shun Yuan&#x27;s emotionless golden vertical pupils. In that instant, she felt like she wasn&#x27;t facing a person at all.</p>
<p>Instead, it was an ancient dragon coiled in the abyss. Its eyes just opened. That absolute suppression from the level of life made every cell in her body scream, tremble, and instinctively want to kneel down and submit. If it were the old her, she might have felt fear and resistance. But now, under the terrifying dragons might, Akasha felt weak all over, and an unprecedented heat rose from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s amazing. This is the king she has always dreamed of. This is the kind of man she&#x27;d be willing to give everything for. Chapter 140. Akasha&#x27;s submission rate is 99%.</p>
<p>Shinyuan looked at her pupils which were dilated with extreme excitement and fear. Akasha his voice became deep and like the resonance of metal rubbing together. Yet it possessed an undeniable magic. Look at me. Akasha was forced to stare directly into those golden dragon eyes.</p>
<p>Her breathing quickened. Her full red lips parted slightly, but she couldn&#x27;t make a sound. She could only gaze at her god with the fascination of a devout believer. You are smart and ambitious, which is good. You want to use my seed to go back and fight for power in the family, to become the queen of the Rothschilds, and even to turn me into a tool for your family&#x27;s revival.</p>
<p>Akashas pupils suddenly contracted. She was about to explain when Shun Yuan&#x27;s sharp gaze forced her back down. Shu, don&#x27;t speak. Listen to me. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re ambitious.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t dislike ambitious women. You want to be queen? I can help you. You want to trample that Katarina under your feet? I can help you that too. Even if you want the Rothschild family to become the rulers of the Federation, I can help you achieve that. But at this point, Shinuan abruptly changed the subject and a chilling light burst forth from his golden dragon eyes.</p>
<p>You must remember one thing to me. Whether you are a powerful countess or a future queen, with absolute authority, Shin Yuan lowered his head, his golden vertical pupils drawing closer to her face. In my presence, you have only one identity. That&#x27;s my woman, Shinuan&#x27;s woman. Your body, your soul, your loyalty must belong to me without reservation.</p>
<p>Did you understand? These words were doineering, arrogant, and even somewhat insulting. If it were the old Akasha, she would have already poured a glass of red wine on him and ordered her men to chop this arrogant man into pieces and feed him to the dogs. But now upon hearing this doineering declaration of sovereignty, Akasha felt the jolt of electricity run down her spine and straight to the top of her head, making all the bones in her body feel weak. Looking at the man before her, radiating endless charm, the last trace of pride that belonged to the heir of the Rothschild family in her eyes was also concealed and became a thing of the past at this moment. Instead, there was an intense, unyielding love and obedience.</p>
<p>I understand. She strained to raise her neck as if offering herself as a sacrifice and responded in a trembling yet incredibly firm voice. Dragon Lord, I am yours forever. Very good. A golden light flashed in Shun Yuans eyes.</p>
<p>He was quite satisfied with the answer. Another hour passed. The heavy alloy door of the solitary confinement cell finally opened slowly once again. Shin Yuan walked out, dressed neatly and looking refreshed. He straightened his collar and his golden dragon eyes had returned to their normal black.</p>
<p>But the captivating glint deep within them could not be hidden. His first realworld combat exercise after awakening his S-rank bloodline was more effective than he had imagined. Not only did he not feel tired at all, but he also felt that the dragon energy in his body was becoming more and more pure and profound, and his mental strength also increased dramatically. This body that suffers from the cold and the countis are indeed highly nourishing. Shinyuan was in a great mood.</p>
<p>Whistling, he stroed confidently toward the end of the corridor, and behind him, that still closed confinement room. Akasha didn&#x27;t tidy herself up as usual or put on that hottie posture. She wasn&#x27;t even dressed, just wrapped in a thin blanket, her bare feet covered in red marks. She stumbled and ran to the door. She leaned against the door frame, her beautiful eyes gazing intently at Shun Yuan&#x27;s departing figure.</p>
<p>That figure wasn&#x27;t particularly broad- shouldered, but in her eyes, it was more majestic than any mountain in the world. This man, he&#x27;s a devil, a devilish dragon lord who is both delicious and doineering, capable of stealing a woman&#x27;s soul. Akasha only reluctantly looked away after Shaun Yuan&#x27;s figure completely disappeared around the corner. She lowered her head, gently stroking her still flat stomach, a bewitching and alluring smile playing on her lips. &quot;Dragon Lord,&quot; she murmured to herself.</p>
<p>Her voice is soft as a sigh, yet as heavy as a vow for you, I will seize that throne. I will make the entire Rothschild family and adorement on your crown. Right at this moment, as Shun Yuan reached the elevator, a clear and pleasant system notification sounded in his mind once again. Ding. Target Akasha has been detected to have completely submitted both physically and mentally and has developed a strong desire to dedicate herself.</p>
<p>Submission value plus 10%. Current total progress 99%. Congratulations host. You are only one step away from achieving ultimate conquest. Shinyuan paused, glanced back in that direction, and his smile deepened.</p>
<p>99%. This is essentially equivalent to a complete takeover. The remaining 1% will probably only be truly fulfilled when the child is actually born or when she regains power in the family. But there&#x27;s no rush anyway. The person is already his.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no way he can escape now. Shin Yuan pressed the elevator button, watching the numbers keep changing and began to plan his next move. Akasha&#x27;s situation is settled now. Shouldn&#x27;t we go and meet that icy female CEO who gave him the stimulant? And while we&#x27;re at it, get back the interest we haven&#x27;t collected yet, principal and interest. Chapter 141.</p>
<p>Yuing Longs of her FFF level talent. The Umbrella Corporation headquarters, Underground Command Center. The atmosphere here was so heavy it felt like lead, and even the movement of the air seemed to slow down. In the very center of the hall stood a crimson crystal throne that seemed particularly out of place at that moment. That was no ordinary object, but was made from the hardest skull of the lava lord, an eighth realm star beast, and its entire body radiated a heart palpitating high temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>At this moment, a woman is sitting on this throne, jade exquisite. She wasn&#x27;t wearing armor, but only a simple crimson flowing robe. Her long hair casually tied up, revealing a section of her slender, fair neck. She leaned back lazily in her chair, one hand supporting her chin, her long legs crossed, one toe lightly tapping the air. Even with such a casual demeanor, the absolute suppressive force originating from the level of life itself still made everyone present have to be careful, even when breathing.</p>
<p>Before her stood Leon, a dignified sixthrem marshall king from the Umbrella Corporation, standing obediently with her back stiff like a primary school student having her homework checked by a teacher. Beside Li Yun, Su Ching Xu, Ling, L Yu, Lin, Sharon, Natasha, and even the icy female Sio Muan Bing, who had just joined the family, were all present. So, Yu Ling Long finally spoke, her voice clear and ethereal, revealing neither joy nor anger. Yet it resonated throughout the hall. You mean that the kid&#x27;s frank talent is just a facade? In reality, he possesses a rule-based ability that can only be triggered by a high potential member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Yes, your majesty. Lie Yun stealed herself and stepped forward, delivering the prepared statement. She had already prepared. After a long period of observation and verification, Shin Yuans talent is very likely not F level, but the legendary FFF level, good luck never ends. The doineering aspect of this talent lies in the fact that it directly quantifies biological instincts into a reward mechanism akin to some kind of universal law.</p>
<p>As Le Yun spoke, she brought up the holographic projection behind her which listed Shun Yuan&#x27;s achievements and output. During this period, Lin Sharing gained a 30% increase in the probability of all members talent awakening. Natasha brought a recipe for a potion that increases health and vitality. Dr. Su Ching Xu directly triggered a permanent 5% increase in the upper limit of all martial artist genes.</p>
<p>Leian paused here, her tone revealing an undisguised fervor. This makes no sense and violates the law of conservation of energy, but it happened anyway. Real and efficient. Yu Ling Long narrowed her in different Phoenix eyes slightly, her gaze sweeping over every woman present. That&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>She chuckled softly, her fingertips lightly tapping the armrest. Since that&#x27;s the case, let me see the real thing. Just hearing reports won&#x27;t determine that kid&#x27;s worth. It was all prepared long ago. Such pushed up her gold rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>Even when facing an eighth realm Marshall emperor, her innate research fanaticism did not diminish in the slightest. She walked clattering in her red high heels to the center of the hall. Carrying her signature silver metal case. Click. The box was opened and a cloud of white cold air wafted out.</p>
<p>Two vials of potion radiating a rich blood red glow and seemingly containing miniature storms swirling within lay quietly in the shockabsorbing groove. This is a fifth tier ultimate blood and chi enhancement potion made overnight based on the formula provided by Shun Yuan and raw materials sourced from across the country. Suching picked up the medicine, turned to look at Ling and L Yu, and a confident smile appeared on her lips. You too. Do you dare to try the medicine for his majesty? Without uttering a single word or even frowning, Longing strode forward, grabbed the potion, and gulped it down.</p>
<p>Lung, you followed closely behind, her movements equally swift and decisive. Boom. Dash. The moment the medicine entered the throat, two violent surges ofQi and blood suddenly exploded in the hall. Ling was originally at the early stage of the fifth realm.</p>
<p>And now, under the influence of that enormous medicinal power, her body was radiating golden light. The faint dragon scale patterns beneath her skin shimmerred wildly, and the blood and chi within her body surged and roared. Click. A crisp sound like an eggshell breaking came from inside her body. The middle stage of the five realms.</p>
<p>Not only that, her total chi and blood volume continued to rise wildly until it surged by a full 100,000 points before finally stopping. Meanwhile, Lung Yus body was filled with a chilling aura. Her realm, which had been somewhat unstable due to her recent breakthrough, was instantly stabilized as a rock under the nourishment of this medicinal power. She even showed a faint tendency to advance towards the peak of the early stage of the fifth realm. In just 3 minutes, the two grand masters of the fifth realm have improved their strength by another small level.</p>
<p>Call longing exhaled a long breath of turbid air which shot out several meters away like a sharp arrow, creating a shallow crater in the ground. She clenched her fist, feeling the surging power within her, her eyes filled with awe. No side effects. Such spoke at the opportune moment as if she were showcasing a perfect work of art. It doesn&#x27;t overdraw potential, doesn&#x27;t damage the foundation.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s purely an increase in the upper limit, and we&#x27;ve already started mass production of this. In a corner of the hall, Muan Bing, who had maintained a cool and aloof demeanor, finally couldn&#x27;t hold back any longer. She stared at Long Ing and L Yu. Her eyes, which had not long ago sparkled with business acumen and rational thinking, now filled with the bewilderment of a worldview collapsing. Real? It&#x27;s really true.</p>
<p>This kind of black tech potion, which completely defies common sense in biology and is enough to make the top scientists at Tianin industry collectively hang themselves really came from that scoundrel. She recalled her previous sarcastic remarks about Su Chin Zhu and felt a burning pain in her cheeks as if she had been slapped in public. If this is the truth, then what about the business logic she has adhered to for so many years and the heavenly god industrial technology tree that she is so proud of? Is this a joke? Yuling Long took in everything. She sat up straight and a hint of seriousness finally appeared in her in different eyes. &quot;Anything else?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot; Such was clearly satisfied with the effect. She pulled up another encrypted document and pointed to the complex 3D model on it. &quot;The dragon blood tempering pool is a strategic level building. Once completed, it can grant ordinary people a physique comparable to that of a first level martial artist.&quot; Then she swiped her finger and an extremely complex stream of code appeared on the screen along with a core model that was constantly iterating itself. And this too such turned to look at Mu Wan Bing, a hint of amusement in her eyes.</p>
<p>Apocalyptic level AI source code. This was the reward that would be unlocked if President Mu could, according to the systems prediction, completely submit and complete that step. Apocalypse, Mu Wan Bing exclaimed in surprise. As the head of a tech giant, she knew all too well the significance of those two words. That&#x27;s the legendary god level AI that possesses self-awareness, can instantly take over the global network, and double the combat power of the mechanical legion.</p>
<p>That was the ultimate dream that Tion Shin industry had strived for for 50 years, but hadn&#x27;t even scratched the surface of. Chapter 142. Yuling Long also wants to warm her feet. Thump, thump, thump. Mu Wan Bings heart began to pound violently.</p>
<p>A complex reaction mixed with an extreme desire for technology and a strange emotion towards that man. That scoundrel is actually worth so much. As long as I&#x27;m with him, I can get the apocalypse. Even by the most demanding business perspective, the return on this deal is ridiculously high. Ding.</p>
<p>Target Mu Wing&#x27;s affection value has increased by 3%. Current affection value 89%. If Shin Yuan heard this notification, he would probably be overjoyed. But at this moment, Muan being bit her lower lip. Her last line of psychological defense still stubbornly resisting.</p>
<p>That was more than just a transaction. It was binding her entire life to that man. She looked at Lin Sharon, whose belly was slightly protruding and whose face was full of happiness, not far away. And then at the heroic longing, her mind was in complete turmoil. She and that man haven&#x27;t even had a proper date yet.</p>
<p>Are they going to fast forward to this point? Call. Yuling Long let out a long sigh of relief and leaned back in her chair. She closed her eyes, seemingly processing the news that was enough to shake the entire empire. After a long while, she opened her eyes again, her tone carrying a rare hint of emotion. This little guy with F-level talent managed to turn himself into a mobile strategic treasure trove through this method.</p>
<p>Based on these achievements alone, his value is indeed no less than mine, an eighth realm marshall emperor. In the long run, it may even be worse. After all, no matter how strong Yu Ling Long is, she can only guard one area. What Shin Yuan brought was a leap in the life level of the entire clan. Just as the atmosphere in the hall eased slightly because of Yu Ling Longs conclusion, boom.</p>
<p>The heavy alloy door was suddenly kicked open violently from the outside. The loud noise echoed through the empty hall, startling everyone. A figure swaggered in, backlit by the light. Shinyuan. He had just won over Akasha and was riding high on his success, humming an unknown tune, hands in his pockets, looking as casual as if he were back in his own backyard.</p>
<p>Oh, everyones here. Shin Yuan glanced around, completely ignoring the red-clad woman in the center of the hall, whose aura was extremely restrained. His gaze immediately locked onto Muan Bing, who was standing in the corner, her mind in turmoil. His eyes lit up and his signature wicked smile instantly appeared on his lips. &quot;Mr.</p>
<p>Moo, I&#x27;ve been looking for you for ages. Turns out you were hiding here, having a little meeting.&quot; Shin Yuan strode over, completely ignoring the extremely strange looks he was receiving from those around him. &quot;How are you? Does your foot still hurt after I gave you a physical therapy session in the car last time?&quot; He moved closer to Muan Bing, his gaze unabashedly fixed on her jade-like feet clad in silver stilettos. His tone flippant yet laced with an obsequious arrogance. You look great today.</p>
<p>Why don&#x27;t we strike while the iron is hot and go to my room to take another boost? Don&#x27;t worry. This time I&#x27;m not charging you. It&#x27;s purely after sales service. By the way, shall we discuss further the issue of manufacturing the future successor of Tianin Industries? you. Mu Wan Binging face flushed bright red instantly all the way down to the roots of her neck.</p>
<p>In front of so many sisters, especially in front of the legendary figure, Yuing Long being so blatantly teased by him made her feel like her toes were going to pierce through the soles of her shoes. Cough, cough, cough. Lie Yun coughed desperately as if her lungs were about to burst, and her eyes darted frantically toward the center of the hall, trying to give this reckless young man a hint. Such Ching Zu pushed up her glasses, a sly smile playing on her lips. Instead of offering any warnings, she fanned the flames from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Wow, consultant Shan is so dedicated. She just got off work from the countess&#x27;s office, didn&#x27;t even have a sip of water, and is already rushing to provide after sales service for President Mo. Her stamina is truly admirable. That&#x27;s right. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t catch the trap in her words.</p>
<p>Instead, he raised an eyebrow smuggly. What&#x27;s a little tiredness? My body is made of iron. As he spoke, he reached out to pull Muan Bing. Cough, cough, cough, cough. Leun coughed even more violently, as if she was about to cough her throat out.</p>
<p>Shinuan finally realized that something was wrong. It&#x27;s so quiet. Aside from Leons coughing, why did everyone else sound like quailes? He paused and following Lean&#x27;s almost convulsing gaze, stiffly turned his neck. Then he then saw the woman in red sitting on the crimson throne, looking at him with a half smile. Holy crap.</p>
<p>The phrase national essence almost slipped out of Shun Yuans mouth, but he swallowed it back down, turning it into a half-voiced hiccup. Jade Exquisite, the five pillars of humanity, eighth realm Marshall Emperor. That legendary female assassin who could kill star beasts like mowing grass and whose temper was 10,000 times colder than Ling. What is she doing here? And wasn&#x27;t I just harassing a respectable woman right in front of her? Shin Yuan felt a cold sweat instantly seep out from his back. The sense of crisis of being targeted by a top predator made his scalp tingle.</p>
<p>&quot;Your highness, when did you arrive?&quot; Shin Yuan chuckled twice, trying to cover up his embarrassment with a smile, but his feet sly took half a step back. It has always been there. Yu Ling Long rested her chin on her hand, her phoenix eyes gleaming with an unfathomable light. She looked Shun Yuan up and down as if he were examining a rare treasure that had just been unearthed or as if she were scrutinizing a daring and audacious madman. I heard you&#x27;re good at warming feet.</p>
<p>Her voice was light and airy, yet it struck Shin Yuans heart like a heavy hammer. The air in the hall froze instantly. Lean closed her eyes in despair. Oh no, this kid&#x27;s going to get a beating. Ling and L Yu also looked nervous, fearing that this lord might slap Shin Yuan into the wall.</p>
<p>But who is Shinuan? That&#x27;s a man who possesses a system, has awakened S-rank immortal dragon blood, and can walk through a sea of flowers without a single petal touching him. After the initial panic, his reckless spirit was actually aroused. Fortune favors the bold. This is an eighth realm Marshall emperor. If only, Shin Yuan quickly suppressed his fear, and the ingratiating smile on his face instantly changed, becoming even brighter and more shameless.</p>
<p>Your Majesty, what you&#x27;re saying is all about being good at something or not. That&#x27;s all just for the benefit of beautiful women with perfect looks and figures. Instead of retreating, he stealed himself and walked step by step toward the throne that exuded a terrifying aura. I can tell you must be tired after flying all the way from the capital. It&#x27;s cold and chilly at such heights, and it&#x27;s common for blood and energy to stagnate in the legs.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan walked to the bottom of the steps in front of the throne, stopped, looked up, and boldly stared at Yuing Longs long legs that were crossed. She wore a pair of crimson combat boots made of neither gold nor jade with flamelike patterns flowing across them, wrapping around her calves, and outlining breathtakingly smooth lines. &quot;How about I give you a massage, too?&quot; His dash. A chorus of gasps filled the hall. Leons eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p>
<p>Su Ching Xu almost dropped the tablet in her hand. Natasha and Mu Wan Bing looked at Shin Yuan as if he were a mad man. Has he gone mad? That&#x27;s the legendary war goddess Ling Long. She could kill a hundred of him with a single slap. How dare he flirt with such a powerful figure.</p>
<p>Yuing Long was also taken aback. In all her years, she has seen people who feared her, respected her, begged her, and even hated her. But someone like Shan Yuan, who is clearly just a nobody at the fourth realm, dares to look at her legs like that right in front of her and even dares to make such a request. He was the first. Oh, Yuling Long was so angry that she laughed instead.</p>
<p>A smile that could make the world pale in comparison bloomed on her beautiful face. Okay. She actually stretched out one foot and dangled it in front of Shin Yuan. The crimson combat boots were less than 10 cm from Shan Yuans nose, and the scorching heat emanating from the boots made his cheeks sting. Since you have such filial piety, then come on over.</p>
<p>Yu Ling Longs voice carried a hint of mockery. However, these boots of mine are made from the hide of an eighth level flame demon dragon, weighing a,000 lb and imbued with protective dragon flame. If you can&#x27;t take them off or if you get burned to ashes, don&#x27;t blame me for not warning you. This is a test and a warning. Everyone sensed the ill intent in his words.</p>
<p>Chapter 143. The high and mighty Jade Lingling Long experiment. The air in the hall seemed to be sucked out, leaving only a suffocating silence. Shin Yuans hand hovered in midair, his fingertips less than an inch from the crimson combat boot. The dark red fire patterns flowing on the boot seemed to breathe as if they were alive, emitting a high temperature that could distort light.</p>
<p>Shinuan, you&#x27;re insane. Stop it. A sharp shout, trembling with obvious emotion, suddenly shattered the deathly silence. Longing no longer cared about dignity, nor about the serious crime of being disrespectful in front of an eighth realm marshall emperor. She rushed forward, her usually sassy and composed face now ashen.</p>
<p>Her phoenix eyes revealing an unprecedented panic and anxiety. Those are battle boots made from the toughest reverse scale leather armor of an eighth realm flamed demon dragon. They are covered with the most venomous primal dragon fire from the flame demons last moments. Lyings voice even cracked slightly. Don&#x27;t even mention that you&#x27;re only at the fourth realm now.</p>
<p>Even a sixthrem marshall king would be instantly burned to ashes if you touched it rashly. Not even a bone fragment would be left. She knew all too well where those boots came from. Back when you Ling Long slew the flame demon dragon that wre havoc in the western region, that battle turned half the sky red. These boots are not just protective gear, but also powerful weapons with built-in counterattack mechanisms.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be foolish. Step back now. On the other side, Leun couldn&#x27;t sit still any longer. This usually charming and sophisticated woman who loves driving has lost her composure at this moment. She quickly stepped forward, her beautiful eyes filled with warning and pleading as she looked directly at Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>Shinuan, stop fooling around. Who is her majesty Ling Long? Do you think you can just toy with her like that? Le Yun gritted her teeth, lowered her voice, and spoke rapidly. You are not just yourself now. If you get injured because of this absurd thing or anger his majesty, how am I supposed to explain this to the higher-ups? She even turned to look at you, Ling Long, a humble smile creeping across her mature and alluring face. Your majesty, this boy has just awakened his bloodline.</p>
<p>His brain&#x27;s been fried, and he doesn&#x27;t know the rules. Please be magnanimous and don&#x27;t take it to heart. I&#x27;ll take him away and put him in solitary confinement. The two women reacted more intensely than the other. One feels sorry for her husband.</p>
<p>The other feels sorry for the company&#x27;s precious child. Shin Yuan felt a warmth in his heart as he listened to the two women chattering beside him. But he didn&#x27;t back down. The arrow is on the string and it must be released. Now that he&#x27;s backed down, he&#x27;s not only showing his weakness in front of you, Ling Long, but he&#x27;s also ruining the image of the dragon master that he&#x27;s worked so hard to establish.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even if there are mountains of knives and seas of fire ahead, even if their crotch is on fire, men have to grit their teeth and push forward. Not to mention, Shin Yuan looked up at the woman in red on the throne, who had a half smile on her face and a playful look in her eyes as if she were watching a monkey perform. That arrogant, indifferent gaze that looked down on all living beings like ants made him very uncomfortable. Yes, I have F-level talent, but I also cheated. You want to watch a show? Then I&#x27;ll put on a show of Havoc in heaven for you.</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern, instructor Long and sisterly. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t turn around. He simply waved his hand with his back to the crowd, his voice carrying a ruthless and resolute tone. However, since your majesty has given me this opportunity to show my filial piety, what kind of man am I if I can&#x27;t even take off my shoes? You longing was speechless with anger. Okay, very good.</p>
<p>On the throne, Yuling Long watched this scene, a hint of amusement flashing in her indifferent Phoenix eyes. She didn&#x27;t retract her foot. Instead, she pressed it down slightly, and the flame patterns on her boots instantly lit up, distorting and deforming the surrounding space with intense heat. Since you&#x27;re so bold, let me see just how tough you really are. Before he could finish speaking, boom dash.</p>
<p>The S-rank undying dragon blood within Shan Yuan&#x27;s body seemed to have been provoked, unleashing a furious roar like a surging river within his veins. The faint golden patterns on his skin instantly solidified, and layers of fine golden dragon scale phantoms covered his hands with his fingertips faintly gleaming with a cold light resembling dragon claws. Those originally jet black pupils have completely transformed into majestic, doineering, and emotionless pure gold vertical pupils. A dragon&#x27;s might, originating from the primordial era, though immature, was extremely noble. Centered on him, it suddenly erupted in the command hall.</p>
<p>Yu Ling Long, who had been resting her chin on her hand with a playful expression, finally showed a hint of genuine surprise in her indifferent Phoenix eyes. Um, she originally just wanted to teach this arrogant brat a lesson so that he would back down. But at the very moment Shun Yuan erupted, she keenly sensed an aura that even she found unsettling. If left unchecked, this aura, once leaked out, would likely trigger a furious counterattack from the candle dragon in the deep sea. That&#x27;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yuing Longs red lips curved slightly, and her jade hand, which had been casually resting on the armrest, gently pressed down. Buzz, an invisible spatial ripple instantly spread out, completely isolating the entire command hall from the outside world. This is an absolute barrier that only an eighth realm expert could set up. Even if the fighting inside is so fierce that the world collapses, no one outside will be able to sense it at all. After doing all this, Yuing Long&#x27;s beautiful eyes fell back on Shin Yuan, her gaze filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>Come, let me see just how much your so-called sgrade dragon blood really weighs. whether it can suppress this flame demon that won&#x27;t rest even in death. Just as the barrier fell, Shin Yuan&#x27;s hand finally landed squarely on the crimson combat boot. Sizzle. A terrifying sound like raw meat being thrown onto a red-hot iron plate instantly pierced everyone&#x27;s eardrums.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan&#x27;s face twitched violently. The veins on his forehead bulged instantly and the large beads of sweat evaporated in the high temperature before they could even roll off. Pain. The pain was excruciating, like having your bones ripped out. It wasn&#x27;t just the high temperature.</p>
<p>There was also a brutal demonic will that was frantically drilling into his meridians through his palm, trying to burn his arm and soul to ashes. However, Shinuan did not back down. He gritted his teeth, veins bulging on his forehead like writhing dragons, and a fighting spirit burning in his golden vertical pupils that was more frenzied than flames. Suppress them, he let out a beastly roar in his heart. The dormant dragon blood within him was completely enraged by this external provocation.</p>
<p>Who is it? It is the bloodline of the ancestor of all dragons. It is a god standing at the top of the food chain. How dare a mere fire dragon skin dead for hundreds of years act so arrogantly in front of it. Boom. The charred black marks on Shun Yuan&#x27;s palm instantly fell off, revealing newly formed skin that was not only completely intact, but also shimmerred with a metallic sheen like liquid gold.</p>
<p>An overwhelmingly powerful devouring force surged from his palm towards the combat boot. The previously rampant and arrogant flame demon poison under the suppression of this higher level bloodline actually emitted a trembling sound that resembled a mournful cry. Visibly, the dark red fire patterns that had been swirling wildly on the boots began to retreat and dim as if they had encountered a natural enemy and were eventually forced back into the depths of the leather by the golden power in Shun Yuan&#x27;s palm. The intense heat on the surface of the boots receded like a receding tide. At that moment, Yuing Longs eyes lit up.</p>
<p>She sensed it. The defensive mechanisms on the boots have collapsed. It wasn&#x27;t cracked by brute force, but rather devoured. Chapter 144. Jade Linglongs conquest mission.</p>
<p>Is this the doineering power of dragon blood? Yuling Long silently assessed the situation. A few months ago, I took in Shinwa, my personal disciple with the SSS level ice phoenix bloodline. Although she broke through a major realm upon awakening, her bloodline purity and suppressive power seem inferior to this S-level dragon blood. His bloodline level is probably not just S level, but at least SSS level or even higher. Just as the empress was secretly making plans in her heart, Shun Yuans large hand, which had recovered to its original state and was even stronger than before, firmly grasped the combat boot that had become docel.</p>
<p>He looked up and a bright, triumphant smile spread across his sweat-covered face. &quot;Your Majesty, I apologize for any offense.&quot; Shin Yuan exerted force with his wrist, his movements gentle yet firm, pulling outwards. Smack! A sound that was extremely faint yet clearly audible in the silent hall. The heavy thousand-pound eighth realm war boots which had once struck fear into the hearts of countless star beasts were forcibly removed from that jade-like foot by him. The air froze completely at that moment.</p>
<p>Everyone stared wideeyed as if they had witnessed some kind of miracle. Longing forgot to glare angrily. Li Yun forgot to breathe. And even the usually calm Su Chingu pushed up her glasses. Asked you, &quot;You took it off? Did he really do it? Shinuan was carrying the heavy combat boot in his hand.</p>
<p>His gaze was fixed directly on what was in front of him. Without the protection of her boots, that stunning beauty was finally revealed to the air without reservation. White without the boots to conceal them. Those feet were like works of art carved from mutton fat jade, fair and delicate with faint blue veins visible beneath the skin. The arch of the instep is elegant and neat.</p>
<p>The ankle is slender and rounded with a fragile texture. The five toes are crystal clear and neat, and the nails gleam with natural pink pearl light, a holy purity wrapped in an ultimate temptation. Only one line of poetry remained in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. Her slender jade-like feet were like frost and snow. Each step a lotus blossom in the mortal world.</p>
<p>My fingers still retained the sensation of when I first touched that delicate skin. The feeling was like touching a piece of warm jade that had just emerged from the water or like touching a cloud with warmth. Have you seen enough? A cool, slightly mocking voice rang out above his head. Shinuan suddenly came to his senses before he could react. Buzz.</p>
<p>Space distorted for a moment. His hand felt lighter. The crimson boot that he had painstakingly removed had vanished into thin air. The next second, it was perfectly intact and put back on Yulings foot. It fits perfectly, as if it had never been taken off.</p>
<p>Yuling Long withdrew her foot and leaned back on the throne in a more comfortable position. She looked at Shun Yuan, who was completely bewildered and holding nothing in his hand. And a half smile appeared on her beautiful face. &quot;Good,&quot; she commented casually. &quot;He&#x27;s a bit too bold, and his eyes are a bit too LWD, but his bloodline power is indeed quite something.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s better than I expected.&quot; Shin Yuan looked down at his empty hands, then at the high and mighty empress. I felt incredibly lost and disappointed. It&#x27;s like taking a bite of an exquisite delicacy, not even tasting its flavor before the plate is taken away. Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough. Behind them, Longing and Li Yun coughed again.</p>
<p>This time as if they were coughing their lungs out. Hey bro, stop spacing out. Do you even know that you just had a brush with death? The fact that they didn&#x27;t kick you away is already a miracle. Shin Yuan remained standing still, motionless. He wasn&#x27;t reminiscing about the feel of the game.</p>
<p>But just now, at the very moment, his fingers brushed against Yu Ling Longs instep. The system, which had been dormant for a long time and only revived when encountering top tier prey, suddenly exploded in his mind with a series of notification sounds that were comparable to a nuclear explosion. Ding. Contact with a godle target detected. Target of investigation, Jade Ling Long.</p>
<p>Identity. One of the five pillars of the human race titled the exquisite war goddess. Age 108 years old. Due to practicing a youth preserving technique, his physical functions are maintained at the peak of a 25-year-old. Talent: Void Flame Phoenix.</p>
<p>SSS rank twin divine gift talent. Talent details. Simultaneously masters two supreme laws, space, and ultimate fire. Achieving unparalleled mastery in both offense and defense. Realm eighth realm marshall emperor mid-stage appearance rating 100 perfect flawless divine beauty body rating 98 golden ratio naturally perfect for battle status unbroken in a proud and lonely woman who has been single for 100 years overall rating 100 points supreme god level boom shinuan looked at the glaring 100 points and felt as if the top of his head was about to be blown off full marks this is The first time the system has ever given a perfect score.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s one point higher than Akasha&#x27;s 99 points. That one point difference is like night and day. And 108 years old single still virgin. This is No, this is an absolute goddess. Before Shinuan could recover from the enormous shock, the systems next task caused him to stop breathing and his heart to pound like a drum.</p>
<p>Ding. A unique mythic level strategy quest has been triggered. Break the empress&#x27;s wings. Mission description. She dwells high above the clouds.</p>
<p>Regarding lowly star beasts as ants. Her heart is as still as water. For centuries, no man has been able to stir a ripple within her. To conquer such a woman, mere flattery and sycophency will suffice. Mission objective.</p>
<p>Defeat her once by any means necessary. Or in a desperate situation, save her once with absolute dominance. utterly shatter her pride, making her willingly fall from grace and call you husband with all her heart. Warning, this target is extremely dangerous. The difficulty level is hell.</p>
<p>A slight misstep could result in the host being physically castrated or directly eliminated. Personal reward. Ignoring genetic potential limitations, the host&#x27;s cultivation level directly advances by one major realm. Note, if the host is currently in the fourth realm, they will directly advance to the fifth realm. If the host reaches the eighth realm, they cannot directly break through to the ninth realm, but they will become invincible in the eighth realm.</p>
<p>Individual rewards. One, strategic level equipment. Imperial armor set forthged with the power of the entire empire. The wearer can use this armor to fight against a ninth realm demagod with the power of the eighth realm peak. Two, strategic level equipment.</p>
<p>Imperial armor. Five sets. With this armor, the wearer can use the power of a seventh realm battle emperor to fight against ordinary eighth realm powerhouses. Three, mass-produced equipment blueprint. Throne armor 50 sets exclusive to sixth realm marshall kings increases combat power by 300%.</p>
<p>Four, several blueprints for mass-produced tier five and tier 4 battle armors will be added later. Looking at this list of rewards that was enough to drive the entire planet blue star crazy, Shinuan felt his blood boiling and burning. It directly elevates you to a whole new realm. And then there&#x27;s the Emperor Armor and the Sovereign Armor, which allow an eighth realm cultivator to fight a ninth realm cultivator. If we could get our hands on this Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s high-end combat capabilities would more than double.</p>
<p>At that time, the Federation and the Beast Tide will all be nothing but a joke. But Shin Yuan secretly glanced at the woman on the throne who looked down upon all living beings like a god. This strategy is difficult. He&#x27;s an eighthrem marshall emperor. He could crush me with a single finger.</p>
<p>How could I possibly defeat him? How can we save it? Why does this system always test me with such difficult tasks? Chapter 145. Shinuan is protective of his food. Don&#x27;t even think about blaming my Chu ran. Have you seen enough? Yu Ling Longs voice floated down from above. inscrable, yet like a feather gently tickling one&#x27;s heart.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan raised his head, and his eyes, which had just lost their golden color, showed no fear, but were instead filled with open and honest appreciation. He grinned, revealing two rows of perfectly white teeth. Your majesty&#x27;s words are truly infuriating. Beauty is something that can never be fully appreciated. I am lamenting the injustice of the creator, who has gathered all the world&#x27;s spiritual energy into you alone.</p>
<p>Even the dust on the soles of your shoes looks more precious than other people&#x27;s eyebrow powder. Loquacious. Yuling Long gave a light snort. Although it was a derogatory term, it didn&#x27;t come out of her mouth with much anger, but rather with a hint of amusement. She adjusted her posture.</p>
<p>Her long legs encased in crimson combat boots crossed and changed direction. Each subtle movement drawing the attention of everyone present. Just as Shin Yuan was about to press on and say a few more sweet words to please the empress, an untimely voice, tinged with coldness and mockery, interrupted, &quot;All right, stop pretending to be all sentimental.&quot; Su Chingu, wearing high heels and holding a tablet computer, walked briskly between the two. She pushed up her gold- rimmed glasses, her gaze sweeping back and forth between Shu Yuan and Yu Ling Long before finally settling on Shun Yuan&#x27;s right hand, the one that had committed the crime. Your Majesty, you may not know this.</p>
<p>Such Ching Xus voice became extremely rational and professional, as if she were reporting a major scientific discovery. This guy&#x27;s hands aren&#x27;t just for taking off shoes or taking advantage of others. Yuling Long raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh, based on my long-term monitoring of his physical functions and the data model derived from multiple experiments,&quot; hearing this, Leans eyelids twitched. I discovered that his so-called F-level talent, which he awakened, not only came with a lucky bonus, but also had an extremely hidden passive skill, god-level reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Such Ching Zu held up one finger, and pointed at Shinuan. Whenever his skin comes into contact with a member of the opposite sex, especially a member with high potential, his brain will instantly read all of their core data, just like a supercomput. age, cultivation level, talent, measurements, and even whether someone is a virgin can be analyzed clearly in a fraction of a second. Once the other party&#x27;s overall score reaches 95 points or above, Such Chingu paused, a cunning smile playing on her lips, his shameless talent would immediately assign him conquest missions. The higher the score, the richer the mission rewards, and the more motivated he would become.</p>
<p>The hall fell into a deathly silence as soon as these words were spoken. Ling, Lyu, and Muan Bing all looked at each other strangely. So, Shin Yuans desperate attempt to take off that Shu wasn&#x27;t out of filial piety or lust at all, but rather to inspect the goods. Dr. Su, that&#x27;s not very interesting.</p>
<p>Having his secret exposed, Shin Yuan blushed, but refused to admit defeat. I did it to understand myself and my enemy. Besides, everyone has a love for beauty. How can this be called lust? This is called yearning for and pursuit of beautiful things. Huh? Pursuing? Such Ching Xu sneered, not buying his act at all.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re just lusting after her body. You&#x27;re despicable. She turned around, faced the women present, and continued her science lecture. Moreover, this rating system is extremely hypocritical and realistic. It doesn&#x27;t just consider talent and ability.</p>
<p>It gives an absurdly high weight to appearance and physique. As Su Ching Xu spoke, she took long strides and walked to the corner of the hall in front of the figure who was trying to minimize his presence. Take our school beauty Lynn for example. Lin Sharon was holding a cup of hot milk tea trying to use the cup to cover her rosy cheeks. Today she wore a soft beige knitted dress.</p>
<p>The fabric was soft and form-fitting. It was a very conservative style, but on her it was stretched to create a visually striking effect that made people blush. Her current cultivation level is only at the second level, which is the lowest among everyone present. However, when it comes to certain specific strengths, apart from Su Chingu, a G-level human nuclear weapon, even Yu Ling Long, who is an eighth level martial emperor, is probably slightly inferior in terms of pure strength. Despite only being at the second level, her overall score was as high as 96 points.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu stretched out her finger and pointed at Lin Chars bulging area in an extremely malicious manner. &quot;Why? Because this E-grade talent, which defies gravity, is considered a rare treasure in that color embryo systems judgment.&quot; &quot;Ah!&quot; Lin Sharon exclaimed in surprise, almost spilling the milk tea in her hand. She frantically raised her arms, trying to block Su Ching Zhus aggressive gaze, and even more so, to block the meaningful stairs that suddenly converged around her. Her pure and beautiful face was instantly flushed with a captivating blush like a ripe peach. Her clear dough-like eyes were filled with shyness and helplessness.</p>
<p>She gently bit her lower lip, looking pitiful as if she wanted to hide, but had nowhere to go, especially her arms, which instead of covering anything, made her already exaggerated curves even more breathtaking due to the compression. The pure innocence of first love, like a white moonlight, mixed with the subtle allure of a married woman, creates a potent poison called pure desire, capable of instantly piercing any man&#x27;s psychological defenses. Tsk tsk tsk. Look at those innocent little eyes. And look at that figure.</p>
<p>Such shook her head like a connoisseur. No wonder someone was willing to risk their life to win her over. Several gazes around them sharpened. Longing looked down at her abs, which were perfect, but leaned towards a muscular physique, and snorted coldly. Lung Yu subconsciously straightened her back, trying to regain some ground with her 1.2 m long legs.</p>
<p>Even the usually confident Natasha couldn&#x27;t help but purse her lips in envy. That&#x27;s enough. A sharp shout interrupted the women&#x27;s gazes as they were being executed. Shinyuan flashed and appeared in front of Lynch. He stretched out his long arm and doineeringly pulled the shy woman who was so embarrassed she wanted to disappear into the ground into his embrace using his broad chest to block all her view.</p>
<p>Turn your eyes away. Shin Yuan glared looking like a vicious wolf guarding its prey. What are you looking at? Never seen a beautiful woman before. Let me tell you, you think you can bully Chuan? No way. Only I can bully this girl and it has to be at night in bed.</p>
<p>Boom. Lynn Sharon&#x27;s face, which was already flushed red, was now completely ripe. She buried her head deep in Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms, her hands gripping his clothes tightly, her body trembling slightly. This bad guy was clearly trying to help her out of a tight spot, but the things he said were even more embarrassing than what Sister Sue said. What do you mean by only he can bully you in bed? Certain blushinducing images involuntarily surfaced in her mind, and her heart pounded like a drum.</p>
<p>Cut. Apart from you, Ling Long and Su Ching Zhu, all the other women rolled their eyes in unison. Who cares about looks? Longing turned her head away irritably. Only you treat those two lumps of meat like treasures. That is, Lungu echoed, her voice carrying a hint of sourness and coldness.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s inconvenient for fighting, of burden. He said that, but the sourness in his tone could be smelled from three blocks away. Shin Yuan chuckled completely ignoring their teasing and instead hugged Lin Char even tighter. He lowered his head and whispered in Lin Sharon&#x27;s burning ear, &quot;Don&#x27;t listen to them. They&#x27;re just jealous.</p>
<p>I like you just the way you are, so soft and fragrant. It&#x27;s the most comfortable thing to sleep with.&quot; Lynn Sharon&#x27;s body went limp and she lost all strength, so she could only let him hold her. But her heart was filled with sweetness. This man can be quite wicked at times, and he&#x27;s also very smooth-talking, but in crucial moments, he&#x27;ll always be the first to stand in front of me and protect me from harm. This feeling of being favored and cherished made her feel that even when facing those powerful older sisters, she was irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Just as the atmosphere here was gradually becoming somewhat romantic and romantic, the one on the throne finally spoke. So, Yu Ling Long rested her chin on one hand. Her phoenix eyes looking at Shin Yuan with a half smile, her voice languid. Since you just touched my foot, does that mean I&#x27;ve become one of the targets of your so-called conquest mission? The pink bubble in the hall burst instantly. The temperature dropped sharply.</p>
<p>Lean&#x27;s heart, which had just been at ease, instantly jumped into her throat again. She knew Yuling Long too well. Although this empress seemed nonchalant, her arrogance was higher than the sky. Did they treat her like prey? In the past, men who dared to have such thoughts would have already been buried with grass growing 3 ft tall. Just as his majesty Li Yun was about to speak, trying to smooth things over, she began to explain.</p>
<p>Yuing Long raised her hand and gently stopped her. She looked at Shun Yuan, and instead of the anger that everyone expected, her beautiful face showed a rare and somewhat doineering smile. That&#x27;s interesting. Yuling Long slowly stood up with her movement and invisible pressure spread out causing everyone to subconsciously hold their breath. She descended the steps one by one, her crimson skirt flowing like flames, each step seeming to tread on the heartstrings of everyone present.</p>
<p>She stopped three steps away from Shinuan. This distance was neither intimate nor distant, but just enough for Shun Yuan to feel her unapproachable aura. Chapter 146. The Empress grants two pardons from death. You want to conquer me? Yuling Long looked down at Shun Yuan, a hotty smile playing on her lips.</p>
<p>Whether you want me to fall for you, submit to you, or even have children for you like they do. Her gaze swept over the women present without the slightest hint of disdain in her eyes, only an air of detached indifference. Go ahead and give it a try. These four words are spoken lightly, yet they exude an overwhelming aura of power. There are countless men in the world who have designs on me.</p>
<p>Yuling Long. Yuluing Long leaned forward slightly, her Phoenix eyes looking directly into Shun Yuans eyes. But in the past century, no one has ever met my standards. Those so-called strong men and geniuses in my eyes are nothing more than a group of mediocre women who only know how to talk big. But you, her gaze fell on Shin Yuans eyes, which still held a hint of arrogance.</p>
<p>The fierceness with which you took off my boots just now and the bloodline within you that even the candle dragon feared did show me a bit of a man. So I&#x27;m giving you this opportunity. You Ling Long stretched out two slender fair fingers and wave them in front of Shin Yuan twice. I&#x27;ll give you two chances to please me. Whether you use force, trickery, or affection, as long as you can make my heartbeat even a little longer, I&#x27;ll consider you the winner in these two opportunities.</p>
<p>No matter what you do, even if you offend me, I will grant you immunity from death. I will neither kill you nor you. This is a privilege I&#x27;m giving you.&quot; After saying that, she withdrew her hand and resumed her aloof and arrogant demeanor. However, before that, you Ling Long turned around, leaving Shin Yuan with a stunningly beautiful back view, her crimson robe drawing a sharp arc in the air. &quot;You should cultivate your own little plot of land first.</p>
<p>You haven&#x27;t even sorted out what&#x27;s inside your house yet. You want to pluck stars from the sky. I&#x27;m waiting for you in the clouds. I hope you won&#x27;t disappoint me too much when we meet next time. As soon as she finished speaking, her figure blurred for a moment and then disappeared into the hall like a burst bubble.</p>
<p>Only a faint lingering fragrance like the afterglow of a burning flame remains, lingering in the air for a long time. Call. Only after confirming that Yuling Long had completely left did Le Yun let out a long sigh of relief. She looked as if she had just been pulled out of the water, her back completely soaked. My god, that scared me to death.</p>
<p>Li Yun slumped unceremoniously in the chair, patting her chest. Shinuan, you&#x27;re incredibly lucky. Her majesty Ling Wong actually gave you a chance. This is hardly an opportunity. Muan Bing, who was standing next to him, also came to her senses and looked at Shun Yuan with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>This is clearly a death trap. If you haven&#x27;t succeeded after using both chances, it&#x27;s probably not just a matter of escaping death, but certain death, right? No. Lung Yu, who had been silent until now, suddenly spoke. She stared in the direction where Yu Ling Long had disappeared, her eyes gleaming with fanaticism. That wasn&#x27;t a death trap.</p>
<p>It was a challenge. It was the empress&#x27;s recognition of the strong. So cool. Lin Sharon was still nestled in Shun Yuans arms, but her little head was completely occupied with other thoughts. She blinked her big eyes and muttered softly.</p>
<p>Why did that lady look even more handsome than Shan Yuans husband when she was talking, &quot;Is that right?&quot; Shin Yuan looked down at the silly girl in his arms and couldn&#x27;t help but flick her forehead. What are you thinking? Aren&#x27;t I handsome? So handsome? My husband is the most handsome. Lin Sharon quickly covered her forehead to show her loyalty, her survival instincts kicking in. Shin Yuan smiled, but his gaze fell on the empty throne in the hall. &quot;Two chances?&quot; He was silently making plans in his mind.</p>
<p>The empress spoke eloquently, but her arrogance was ingrained in her very being to truly win her over. These two get out of jail free cards alone are definitely not enough. You need real skills. However, now that she has given in, this toughest nut to crack will eventually end up in his bowl. All right, stop daydreaming.</p>
<p>Once Li Yun recovered, she immediately reverted to her decisive and efficient commanding nature. She stood up, her expression turning serious. Although her majesty Ling Long is temporarily stationed in the East Sea, the Candle Dragon is still watching us from the deep sea, the crisis is far from over. The most urgent task now is to improve the individual combat capabilities of our umbrella corporations, ordinary fighters. Lean pulled up a holographic blueprint which showed the futuristic and powerful black exoskeleton armor guardian type 1.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Su&#x27;s preliminary assessment, once this armor is mass-produced, it can give an ordinary martial artist strength and defense comparable to a peak first realm martial artist and even withstand the attacks of a second realm star beast. This is a lifeline for the current battle situation. Li Yun stared at Shun Yuan, her eyes filled with urgency and impatience. Have you won over that countest yet? The people have been taken care of.</p>
<p>Shinyuan shrugged, looking relaxed. His subservience level was already maxed out. Even if he sold her out now, she would probably still help him count the money. That&#x27;s great. Lean exclaimed with delight.</p>
<p>Where are the blueprints? Bring them out quickly. Oh well, Shin Yuan touched his nose, a slightly embarrassed yet polite smile on his face. The guardian type 1 blueprint is a final reward. that is to say. He shrugged, giving me a helpless look.</p>
<p>I need to make sure she has good luck so she can get the blueprints. Leon smile froze. Good luck. Her lips twitched slightly. Now immediately.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Shiny Yuan nodded confidently. Even though I have the passive ability to always hit the mark. There still has to be a process, right? I can&#x27;t just do it overnight, can I? And Shun Yuan couldn&#x27;t help but shudder as he recalled Akashas insatiable and greedy demeanor in the solitary confinement room. That woman is at her most viral right now, so getting her on the first try is probably risky just to be on the safe side and to protect the future of the company.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s only right that I sacrifice my looks and try a few more times. Puff Longing, who was drinking water, immediately spatted out. Sacrificing one&#x27;s appearance. She pointed at Shun Yuan, her face full of disbelief. You call that a sacrifice? I think you&#x27;re just enjoying it.</p>
<p>Exactly. Su Ching Xu added. When you came out just now, you were all flushed and unsteady on your feet. You were clearly having a blast. Ahem, that&#x27;s tactics.</p>
<p>Do you even understand tactics? Shinuan blushed and quickly changed the subject. All right. All right. Since the mission is urgent, I won&#x27;t waste any more time talking to you. for that suit of armor for the brothers on the front lines.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m off to well back to work overtime. After saying that, he ignored the disdainful looks from the women, released Lin Sharon, and turned to walk out, etc. Lean suddenly called out to him. What&#x27;s wrong, sisterly? Any other instructions? Shinuan turned around. Lean looked at him with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, she took out a delicate little bottle from her pocket and threw it to him. Then Shinyuan reached out and caught it. Upon closer inspection, he saw several large characters written on the bottle, rank six, dragon tiger strengthening pill. This is old Xiao&#x27;s secret treasure. He says it can strengthen the body&#x27;s foundation and improve health and is good for your health.</p>
<p>Lein turned her head away somewhat awkwardly. You better watch yourself, kid. Don&#x27;t actually die from a woman&#x27;s belly. The Umbrella Corporation still needs you. Shin Yuan held the bottle of pills, feeling a surge of emotion.</p>
<p>This is what a real sister is like. Don&#x27;t worry, sisterly. Shin Yuan stuffed the pill into his pocket, gave Leun a somewhat awkward salute, his face radiating confidence and smuggness. With my S-rank undying dragon blood, this little scene is nothing. Akasha, get all clean and wait.</p>
<p>Your husband is here again. Watching Shun Yuan strutting away, the women in the hall exchanged glances and finally couldn&#x27;t help but burst out laughing. Even though they all understood that this man was a scoundrel, a lecher, and even a bastard, but undeniably, as long as he was there, even when facing a catastrophic beast tide or a desperate predicament, they would always feel inexplicably at ease. Because this man always manages to use his unconventional FFF level talent, and in the most unconventional way to create the most serious miracles. Chapter 147.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan stays indoors. Three women come knocking on the door. The heavy alloy door of the solitary confinement cell closed again, completely isolating it from the noise and prying eyes in the corridor. Shinyuan leaned against the door and let out a long breath. Then he could no longer suppress the smug smile on his lips.</p>
<p>Having managed to acquire the eighth realm empress&#x27;s combat boots and put on a perfect show in front of so many important figures. This feeling is  awesome. He hummed an unknown tune and turned to look at the large metal bed. Upon seeing this, Shinuan&#x27;s eyes widened, and the blood and chi that had just calmed down instantly began to surge again, rushing straight to his head. The noble countest from the Federation was not wearing the black velvet gown that symbolized power and majesty, nor was she wrapped in a casual blanket she had worn before.</p>
<p>She changed her clothes, or rather, a piece of white cloth with very little fabric. This was a pure white silk slip dress with extremely thin straps that dig into her round fair shoulders as if they would snap at the slightest pressure. If this style were worn by Lin Chur, it would be the epitome of pure desire. If worn by Su Chingu, it would be the madness after abstinence. But when worn by Blood Rose, which usually has a black and red color scheme, the stark contrast is simply irresistible.</p>
<p>Her long, wavy, golden red hair fell casually onto the snow white silk, as stunning as splashed ink. The skirt was extremely short, barely covering the top of her thighs, and as she crossed her legs, large suedes of dazzling white skin were exposed to the air without reservation. The queen&#x27;s original hottiness and aloofness were somewhat suppressed by this pure white night gown, turning into a delicate and vulgar feeling that made one want to crush her in their arms. But she still maintained that aristocratic air, swirling her wine glass in her hand and looking at Shin Yuan with a dreamy gaze. Dragon Lord.</p>
<p>Akasha parted her red lips slightly, her voice like arssonic coated in honey, both sweet and poisonous. You&#x27;re finally back. She put down her wine glass, stepped barefoot onto the cold floor, and walked towards Shun Yuan step by step. It was so noisy outside just now. I was so scared being all alone here.</p>
<p>Afraid? Shinuan almost burst out laughing. You, a grandmaster at the peak of the fifth realm, a ruthless countess. Are you afraid? But he falls for it. Men, even if they know a woman is acting, as long as the acting is good and makes them feel good, they&#x27;ll believe it&#x27;s real. Shinyuan opened his arms, letting this beauty fall into his embrace.</p>
<p>The moment it was in my arms, a rich milky scent mixed with the aroma of a high-end perfume filled my nostrils. Tsk tsk tsk. Shun yuan&#x27;s large hand unceremoniously embraced her stunning waist and hip curves, the warmth of his palm passing through the thin silk, causing the person in his arms to tremble slightly. Akasha, you&#x27;re a deadly fairy. Shin Yuan looked down at the stunningly beautiful face so close to his own and exclaimed in sincere admiration, &quot;This outfit is a great choice.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s much more stylish than that dark black dress. Before you were a countest for others to see. Now you are my little white rabbit belonging only to me. A woman like you is truly a natural beauty. If this happened in ancient times, you would definitely be a scourge to the country, causing the emperor to neglect his duties from then on.</p>
<p>Akashas eyes flashed with a triumphant smile upon hearing this. She understands men so well, especially for men like Shan Yuan, who have just awakened their doineering bloodline and are bursting with a desire to conquer. Blindly obeying is meaningless and being arrogant all the time will annoy him. Only this extreme tension between noble status and base behavior can keep him perpetually interested in her. She stretched out her arms and wrapped them around Shin Yuan&#x27;s neck.</p>
<p>Akasha can change her appearance in many different ways as long as the Dragon Lord likes it. Maid, teacher, or any role the Dragon Lord likes. As long as the Dragon Lord is pleased, Akasha will do anything for you. Even if it means ruining the empire, I will only listen to you. By the end, her voice was so low it was almost inaudible, tinged with a distinct tremor and longing.</p>
<p>That was the fatal attraction that S-class dragon blood had on her. Shiny Yuan felt as if the powder keg inside him had been completely ignited. Great. Excellent. Since you have such filial piety, then this dragon lord will take a good look tonight and see just how pure you are, you little white rabbit.</p>
<p>At the same time, inside the presidential suite on the upper level of the base, Muan Bing did not celebrate her survival like the others, nor did she rest. She sat alone in front of the huge floor toseeiling window, holding a cup of coffee that had long since gone cold, staring blankly at the dark night outside. The room was dark with only the occasional beams of search light from outside the window, illuminating her cool and exquisitly beautiful profile. Her mind was in a jumble. One moment it&#x27;s Su Ching Xus absurd statement about saving the company by sleeping and the next it&#x27;s the scalding heat of Shun Yuan massaging her feet in the car, especially the day before yesterday in the bath house.</p>
<p>The man was completely red like a furnace. In order to save him and herself, she took the initiative to hug him. Call. Muan Bing let out a long breath, trying to dispel the inexplicable heat in her body. She lowered her head, her gaze falling on her bare feet.</p>
<p>Those feet were beautiful, fair, and long, like the most perfect work of art. But at this moment, in this cold air, they seemed somewhat lonely and cold. Since the day Shin Yuan used his dragon energy to heal her feet, which were always ice cold, they had warmth for the first time. That warm, cozy feeling was like soaking in a hot spring on a cold winter&#x27;s day. So comfortable it made you want to.</p>
<p>But now that enthusiasm has faded. The cold toxins in my body have been largely eliminated. And the pain that penetrates deep into my bones has also lessened considerably, but the feeling of emptiness has become even stronger. It&#x27;s like someone who&#x27;s used to eating delicacies suddenly having to go back to eating coarse food. That bastard.</p>
<p>Muan Bing bit her lower lip unconsciously rubbing her ankle. He said he wanted to make me one of his own and that I could come to him anytime. And what was the result? He turned around and went into the countess&#x27;s room and didn&#x27;t come out for two whole days. A bittersweet feeling spread through my heart. She, the president of Tianin industry, a trillion dollar ice queen.</p>
<p>When has she ever been treated like this? Isn&#x27;t it just that she knows how to act cute and flirtatious? Muan Bing recalled Su Ching Xus smug expression in the hall earlier, as if she had already won, and Lin Chars blissful, womanly demeanor. Even Ling, who seemed cold and aloof, had a smile on her face after drinking the potion and breaking through her limits. Only her, like an outsider. I can too. If I were like them, will I also be able to feel that warmth? Will I also be able to obtain the apocalyptic source code? Mu Wan Bings cheeks were frighteningly hot in the darkness.</p>
<p>As if possessed, she reached out and hugged her knees, resting her chin on them, curling herself into a small ball. Just once, she muttered to herself, finding an excuse for herself. It&#x27;s just for healing, for the sake of divine revelation. That&#x27;s all. I&#x27;ll go find him once he leaves that vixen.</p>
<p>Time slipped away amidst ambiguity and torment, and two days passed in the blink of an eye. Early morning, Umbrella Corporation headquarters, underground base. The sound of hurried, somewhat angry footsteps echoed down the corridor. Lean walked at the front, her face looking rather grim, and she would occasionally raise her wrist to check the time. Behind her, Ling had a cold face, her hand on the battle sword at her waist, exuding an aura of icy intimidation.</p>
<p>Lyu was still wearing her combat outfit of a black bodycon skirt and black stockings, but her long legs were moving very fast, and her high heels made a crisp, clattering sound on the metal floor, revealing a sense of anxiety. This is absolutely outrageous. Lean finally couldn&#x27;t help but complain. It&#x27;s been two days and two nights, a full 48 hours. Even the strongest kidneys can&#x27;t withstand this kind of abuse.</p>
<p>What kind of spell did Akasha cast on him? Longing snorted coldly, her eyes blazing with murderous intent. I knew that Federation Woman had no good intentions. What&#x27;s a mission? I think it&#x27;s just a honey trap. She wants to use such despicable means to destroy Shin Yuans foundation. Lung Yu didn&#x27;t speak, but her icy blue eyes were full of worry.</p>
<p>Today is the final deadline for registration for the Imperial Prodigy battle. The special plane has been waiting on the tarmac for 2 hours. If we don&#x27;t set off now, we&#x27;ll miss this grand event. The three men stormed to the door of the solitary confinement cell. Thump, thump, thump.</p>
<p>Lean pounded on the alloy door that had been closed for 2 days. Shinyuan, open the door. I know you&#x27;re in there. Stop playing dead. Get out here right now.</p>
<p>The plane is about to take off. There was no movement. It was as quiet as a tomb inside. Chapter 148. Ling, L Yu, and the captured countest traveled together to the capital.</p>
<p>Shinuan. Leans heart skipped a beat. Could it really be? Just as Lyings hand had already gripped the knife hilt, preparing to forcefully break down the door. Squeak. The heavy alloy door finally cracked open.</p>
<p>A head pee out from under the door. It was Shinuan. However, at this moment, his appearance was truly appalling. His once handsome face was now as white as a sheet of paper with large dark circles under his eyes, as if he had been punched twice. Her hair was a mess.</p>
<p>Her lips were chapped and peeling, and she looked completely drained and weak. He was gripping the door frame with one hand and supporting his lower back with the other, his voice like a broken bellows. Who is it? Can&#x27;t people even get some sleep this early in the morning? Upon seeing this scene, the three women at the door gasped in unison. His dash. Is this still the same tough guy who awakened the S-rank undying dragon blood? Whose blood and chi are like a dragon and who can shatter the flame demon boots with a single punch? This is clearly a drag of medicine that just crawled out of a beauty&#x27;s arms.</p>
<p>Shinyuan you. Lean pointed at him, her hand trembling. Are you out of your mind? Look how weak you are now. Shiny Yuan struggled to lift his eyelids, and after seeing who it was, he grinned, revealing a set of big white teeth. Oh, it&#x27;s sisterly.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;m perfectly fine. It&#x27;s just a bit dry. As he spoke, he tried to pull back, asking, &quot;Could you give me another half a day?&quot; The battle inside is at a crucial moment. We&#x27;re again longing finally reached her breaking point.</p>
<p>Seeing Shun Yuan struggling to even stand, yet still trying to crawl back, she felt a surge of anger well up inside her. You come out here. Bang. Longing raised her long, powerful leg and kicked the door, opening the crack in the door. Then she rushed forward, grabbed Shin Yuans arm, and dragged him out of that treacherous room like a dead dog.</p>
<p>Ouch! Be gentle. Instructor Long, my back, my back. Shin Yuan screamed as he was dragged into Long Yings arms. Ling was fierce in words, but her actions betrayed her. She immediately adjusted her position so that he could lean against her firm and elastic breastplate to prevent him from falling.</p>
<p>Leun quickly calls Su Chingu, looking at the man in her arms, barely breathing, Longing felt a surge of anger. Bring me the highest grade chi and blood tonics and that deer antler soup and tiger bone wine. Bring them all. This woman is so vicious. This is premeditated murder.</p>
<p>Leun hurriedly pulled out her communicator and frantically called the medical department. Just as the three women were frantically surrounding Shin Yuan, wishing they could worship him, a languid, elegant voice tinged with satisfaction, drifted out from that beauty&#x27;s den. Ladies, so early, Akasha came out. This was completely different from Shan Yuans pitiful state of being bullied. At this moment, the countest was radiant with beauty.</p>
<p>She wore a white silk night gown with Shan Yuans military overcoat draped over it. The oversized clothes accentuated her tall and voluuptuous figure. Her skin was fair with a rosy glow like a freshly peeled luchi, every inch of which radiated a lustrous sheen. Her beautiful violet eyes shimmerred with a captivating charm so intense it was impossible to ignore. She leaned against the doorframe, holding a half-finished glass of red wine in her hand, looking at the chaotic scene at the doorway, a half smile playing on her lips.</p>
<p>The dragon lord is really something. Everyone told him to take a rest, but he just wouldn&#x27;t listen. They insist on saying they want to feed someone completely in one go. Oh dear, dragon lord, you&#x27;ve really had a tough time. The aroma of the tea coupled with her, &quot;I am the rightful queen attitude,&quot; perfectly complimented her words.</p>
<p>This silenced the three women who were originally prepared to confront him. Longing stared at Akasha, gripping Shun Yuans hand tightly. The coldness in Lyus eyes almost froze into ice. Li Yun gritted her teeth, cursing inwardly. &quot;What a clever trick! What a clever trick.</p>
<p>This foreign woman has figured out the whole absorbing yang to replenishing thing. Half an hour later, after taking several doses of highly concentrated blood nourishing medicine along with Su Chingu&#x27;s specially prepared 10 ingredient tonic soup, the patient was ingested. Shinuan finally recovered. The terrifying regenerative power of the S-rank undying dragon blood came into play once again. His face, which had just been pale and swaying, had regained its color, and his eyes were bright again.</p>
<p>Because of the intense training over the past 2 days, the aura within him has become even more refined than before. There are many ways to train. This is also a special training method. Phew, that feels great. Shinuan threw away the empty medicine bottle in his hand, stood up, and stretched, his bones cracking all over.</p>
<p>Why is everyone staring at me like that? looking at the group of beautiful women around him with their varied expressions. Shin yuan touched his nose a little guilty. Snort longing snorted coldly and turned her head away. Didn&#x27;t some people say you had a broken back? I think you&#x27;re perfectly fine. Cough.</p>
<p>Cough. That was an accident. An accident. Shin Yuan chuckled. Then his gaze swept across the crowd before finally settling on Akasha who was looking at him with a pitiful expression in the corner.</p>
<p>She was being intentionally or unintentionally ostracized by Ling, L Yu, and Li Yun like a wronged little wife. Shinyuans heart softened. This woman was indeed a vixen. She almost drained him dry, but that was only because he was greedy. And the taste is truly unforgettable.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stroed over and in full view of everyone pulled Akasha into his arms. What&#x27;s wrong? Who bullied my countest? Shinuan lowered his head and kissed her smooth forehead in front of everyone, his tone full of doting affection. Tell the dragon lord and he will avenge you. Akasha leaned into his arms, her eyes slightly red, her voice soft and sweet. Nobody bullied me.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just that my older sisters don&#x27;t seem to like me much. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m too stupid. All I know how to do is serve the dragon lord, not fight. These words are no less tantamount to killing someone by breaking their spirit. Natasha standing nearby couldn&#x27;t help but roll her eyes and mutter under her breath.</p>
<p>Keep pretending. I&#x27;ve never seen you this weak back in the Federation. Longing was so angry that she almost drew her sword. But Shinuan found it very agreeable. He tightened his grip, pulling Akashas voluuptuous, soft body closer to him, then turned to look at Li Yun and said, &quot;Seriously, I&#x27;m going to take Sister Lee with me when she goes to Beijing this time.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Lean frowned.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan, this is a battle of geniuses, not a vacation. Bringing a family member is one thing, but what&#x27;s with bringing a prisoner of war? Moreover, her identity is too sensitive. What if she were recognized in the capital? She was not a prisoner of war. Shinuan interrupted Lie Yun, his eyes becoming extremely serious. She is my woman.</p>
<p>And Shin Yuan leaned close to Lians ear and whispered, &quot;Sister Lee, don&#x27;t forget we haven&#x27;t received the rewards we wanted yet. These past two days have been tough. But good luck hasn&#x27;t come yet. If I don&#x27;t keep it with me and continue to work hard, then the sixth and eighth tier health potions, as well as that single soldier battle armor, will be a long way off. These words struck Leans weak spot.</p>
<p>She glanced at Shun Yuan, then at Akasha, who was looking at her defiantly. In the end, all he could do was sigh helplessly. To protect the Umbrella Corporation for those strategic rewards, I&#x27;ll endure it. Okay, take them all. Li Yun waved her hand dismissively.</p>
<p>Anyway, the plane that old Sheen prepared for you is big enough. It can fit you in it, let alone one person. But let me make this clear. Once we get to the capital, keep a close eye on her. If anything goes wrong, you&#x27;re responsible.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Shiny Yuan chuckled and patted Akasha on the shoulder, saying, &quot;Did you hear me? Hurry up and change your clothes. We&#x27;re leaving.&quot; 1 hour later. Umbrella Corporation headquarters top secret he helipad. A giant jet black fighter jet with a futuristic design resembling a soaring rock is quietly resting on the runway.</p>
<p>This is the Shadow Dragon, a strategic class transport aircraft specially allocated here. It has undergone special modifications, and its interior is as luxurious as a mobile palace. Its defensive capabilities are even strong enough to withstand attacks from a Seventh Realm expert. Shinuan stood at the boarding gate with Akasha, who had changed back into a black tight leather outfit that accentuated her stunning figure. Behind him stood Longing, dressed in military uniform, looking dashing and heroic.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also L Yu, who has just broken through to the fifth realm, exuding a cold aura and wearing her signature black stockings and high heels. This trip to the capital is not only to participate in the battle of the prodigies, but also to flex the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s muscles to the entire empire. They&#x27;re gone. Shinuan turned around and glanced at Li Yun, Su Ching Xu, Lin Sharon, Natasha, and the others who had come to see him off. Finally, his gaze lingered for a second on Muan Bing, who seemed to be passing by casually, but had actually been staring at them the whole time at the back of the crowd.</p>
<p>He winked at the aloof CEO and mouthed. Wait for me to come back and warm your feet. Mu wombings face flushed slightly. She glared at him fiercely, then turned and left. But the steps were noticeably lighter.</p>
<p>Boom dash. The engine roared and blue exhaust flame shot out. The black fighter jets soared into the sky, transforming into a streak of light that pierced the heavens and roared toward the imperial capital, the power center of the empire. Chapter 149. Yuling Long wants to kill the enemy countest.</p>
<p>The Shadow Dragon fighter jet pierced through the clouds like a black sword, leaving the long coastline of the East China Sea far behind. Inside the cabin, the luxurious leather sofas are soft and comfortable, and the climate control system regulates the air to a perfect temperature. Shin Yuan held a glass of amber-colored whiskey in one hand while his other hand rested restlessly on Akasha&#x27;s firm and supple waist, his fingertips gently caressing her stunning curves through her black tight leather clothes. Akasha, this leather jacket shows off your figure, but it&#x27;s still a bit too tight, and the feel isn&#x27;t as good as silk. Shinuan took a sip of wine, his tone critical.</p>
<p>Once we get to the capital, I&#x27;ll change back into your old clothes. I love seeing you put on airs and then I before he could finish speaking inside the fighter jet which was flying steadily the space suddenly distorted without warning. It was as if a huge rock had been thrown into a calm lake causing visible ripples to spread in the air in front of Shen Yuan. A terrifying suffocating pressure filled the entire cabin. The wine glass in Shun Yuan&#x27;s hand shattered with a crack and the wine evaporated into nothingness before it even hit the ground.</p>
<p>Akasha&#x27;s hair stood on end. It was an instinctive reaction when a creature encounters a predator. The ripple subsided. A figure dressed in a crimson robe with flowing clouds appeared out of thin air on the coffee table in front of the two. Jade exquisite.</p>
<p>She stood on one foot on the table, her crimson boots, the ones Shinuan had once offended, radiating a chilling heat. She looked down at the two people on the sofa, her indifferent phoenix eyes flashing with unprecedented surprise and murderous intent. Your majesty, the exquisite beauty. Shinuans throat went dry. Why was this woman like a ghost appearing without making a sound? Are you here to see me off? Yuling Long completely ignored Shin Yuans nonsense.</p>
<p>Her eyes, which seemed to pierce through the soul, fell upon Akasha. Just now, as the fighter jet was about to fly out of her perception range, she keenly detected a trace of extremely obscure yet powerful energy fluctuation. That&#x27;s not the aura of a Grandmaster of the Fifth Realm. That&#x27;s the aura of a marshall king of the sixth realm. Six realms.</p>
<p>Yu Ling Longs voice was clear and cold, yet it resounded like thunder in the cabin. Rothschild girl, if I remember correctly, you were only at the peak of the fifth realm when you were captured. Right. Yu Ling Longs tone was inscrable, devoid of any discernable emotion, yet chillingly cold. After being locked in a dark and secluded cell for more than 10 days, he not only did not weaken, but broke through the barrier and became a sixth realm marshall king.</p>
<p>She raised her eyelids, looked at Shun Yuan, and a dangerous smile curled at the corner of her lips. Little guy, don&#x27;t tell me this is also thanks to your talent. Shinuans heart skipped a beat. Broken. They were so caught up in having fun that they forgot about this.</p>
<p>Akasha was already at the peak of the fifth realm, just one step away from the sixth realm. These past two days, she has been thoroughly nourished by his S-grade dragon blood. The wondrous dragon energy not only conquered her mind and body, but also directly helped her break through that bottleneck. The current Akasha is a genuine sixthrem powerhouse. Taking a sixthrem expert from an enemy country to the heart of the imperial capital.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the difference between this and carrying a nuclear bomb to the palace? Your majesty, please let me explain. Shinyuan forced a smile. It was indeed an accident. It was mainly because my genes were too outstanding. Just a little bit of them overflowed and she broke through.</p>
<p>And rest assured, she has completely reformed and turned over a new leaf. She&#x27;s mine now. Are they your people? You Ling Long scoffed lightly, but the killing intent in her eyes not only did not diminish, but intensified. Akasha von Rothschild, the infamous black widow of the Commonwealth, is known for her deep, cunning, and ruthless methods. Would such a woman betray her family and her beliefs simply because she slept with you for a few days? Her increased strength only makes me feel that she is plotting something bigger.</p>
<p>Yuling Long slowly raised her right hand, and a ball of crimson gold flames suddenly ignited in her palm, instantly distorting and deforming the surrounding space. Rather than leaving this potential threat to cause trouble in the capital, I&#x27;d rather clean house for you now. In any case, the dead are the safest. Before the words were even finished, the ball of flame transformed into a crimson fire phoenix, letting out a sharp cry as it pounced towards Akasha. She&#x27;s serious.</p>
<p>She really was going to kill someone. Huh? Akasha was startled and instinctively tried to mobilize her internal energy to resist, but under the pressure of the eighth realm marshall emperor, she couldn&#x27;t even move a finger. Please stop. Without a second thought, Shin Yuan lunged forward, pulling Akasha tightly into his arms and turning his back to the terrifying fire phoenix. To be precise, he wanted to use the martial arts will that Elder Chin left in the jade pendant to deal with her.</p>
<p>Akasha was a secret weapon that I personally brought to the capital. Once she becomes pregnant with the dragon&#x27;s child, he will be able to obtain 1/5if of her vital energy and blood, allowing him to break through to the fifth realm at any time. She&#x27;s one of us. We can&#x27;t kill her. We can&#x27;t kill her.</p>
<p>Yu Ling Longs fingers paused slightly, and the fire phoenix stopped abruptly, less than 3 in from Shin Yuans back. The scorching heat instantly scorched his expensive handmade shirt. You dare to block my attack for the sake of a federal woman? Ying Langs eyes grew even colder. Shin Yuan, have you lost your mind? She&#x27;s not a federal woman. She&#x27;s my wife now.</p>
<p>Shinyuan turned around, his forehead covered in sweat, but he stared intently at Yu Ling Long, his eyes showing no sign of backing down. I know you don&#x27;t believe me. Fine, I&#x27;ll prove it to you. Shin Yuan yanked the trembling Akasha out of his arms, cuped her face in his hands, and roared. Akasha, tell her whose side are you on? Akasha looked at Shun Yuan, who was so close to her, and at his eyes that had turned bloodshot from protecting her.</p>
<p>Miraculously, the fear in her heart dissipated. The sense of submission and love that had been thoroughly imprinted deep within his soul by the S-class dragon blood was awakened. Without any hesitation, in front of this human empress, she stood on tiptoe and pressed her luscious red lips heavily onto Shun Yuan&#x27;s lips. Then she slumped into Shun Yuan&#x27;s arms as if boneless, wrapping her arms around his waist, rubbing her cheek intimately against his chest and calling out in a sweet, sickeningly sweet voice. Of course, the dragon&#x27;s master is yours.</p>
<p>No matter what the dragon lord asks them to do, even if it means death, they would be willing. As long as the dragon lord doesn&#x27;t abandon me. After saying that, she stuck out the tip of her tongue, seemingly still wanting more. That fawning, seductive manner was as if the words shameless were etched onto his forehead. Chapter 150.</p>
<p>Yu Ling Longs phoenix decree. Dead silence. An eerie silence fell over the cabin. Even Longing and L Yu, who had been standing nearby with cold, weary expressions, couldn&#x27;t help but get goosebumps and looked at Akasha with disbelief in their eyes. Is this still the legendary noble, aloof, and ruthless blood rose countus? This person is clearly a latestage patient with a brainwashed love obsessed personality.</p>
<p>Yuing Longs hand, which was suspended in midair, froze. She watched this scene unfold before her, seeing the once arrogant heir of the Rothschilds now snuggling in Shun Yuans arms like a pet, begging for his affection. The intense sense of inongruity made even a seasoned eighth realm marshall emperor like her feel a bit disoriented. this. Yuling Long took a deep breath and withdrew the flames from her palm.</p>
<p>But the weariness in her eyes did not completely disappear. Instead, it became even more intense. To remain in hiding, she even resorted to such a despicable act. This woman&#x27;s cunning is deeper than I imagined. Yuing Long said coldly.</p>
<p>Shinuan, &quot;You are too naive. The more perfect the disguise, the sharper the knife hidden behind it. This is not a disguise at all.&quot; Shinyuan panicked. This is my innate ability. Conquest.</p>
<p>Absolute conquest. Do you understand? I don&#x27;t believe it. You Ling Long is completely unyielding. She won&#x27;t listen to reason unless you let me search her soul. Don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Just as the two sides were about to reach a stalemate again, the cabin&#x27;s public address system suddenly came on. Your Majesty, please show mercy. It was Leans voice, hurried and anxious. Your majesty. According to our data monitoring and psychological assessment, Akashas physiological responses to Shun Yuan have indeed reached the level of absolute loyalty.</p>
<p>Moreover, she is very likely pregnant with Shun Yuans child. That&#x27;s a crucial bargaining chip in our negotiations with the Federation and key to obtaining strategic rewards. We absolutely mustn&#x27;t kill them. Immediately afterwards, Ling also stepped forward, blocking Shin Yuans path and gave Yu Ling Long a military salute. Although I also dislike Ling Long, the war goddess, Shin Yuans talent is truly bizarre.</p>
<p>She must have really been turned against him. Although Ly Yu was a woman of few words, she also shouted out, &quot;Your majesty, those are friendly forces. Don&#x27;t kill them.&quot; Yuing Long remained silent for a long time. She looked at Shu Yuan, then at Akasha, who was clinging to him like a boneless creature. The murderous intent in her eyes slowly faded, replaced by a deep speechlessness and a hint of apprehension that she herself was unaware of.</p>
<p>This man&#x27;s talent is too bizarre. Okay, you Ling Long extinguished the flames at her fingertips. Since you&#x27;re confident you can tame this wild horse, I won&#x27;t interfere any further. But with a flick of her wrist, a crimson token engraved with a lielike phoenix appeared out of thin air in her palm. She casually tossed the token and it transformed into a streak of red light, landing steadily in Shun Yuan&#x27;s hand.</p>
<p>This Phoenix token contains a spatial imprint of mine. No matter where you are in the Empire, as long as you crush it, I can sense it and tear through space to arrive within an instant. Shinyuan&#x27;s eyes lit up. This was a real gem. This is equivalent to having an eighth realm empress as your bodyguard.</p>
<p>Thank you, your majesty. Your majesty is so magnanimous. Shin Yuan happily played with the token. Don&#x27;t get too excited. Yul Ling Long coldly poured cold water on the idea.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t something given away for free. Last time I said I give you two get out of jail free cards. But if you use this token, you&#x27;ll only have one chance left. Besides, Yuling Long gave Shun Yuan a deep look and her figure began to become ethereal. Once you&#x27;re in the capital, don&#x27;t just focus on that woman.</p>
<p>If you embarrassed the East China Sea at the heavenly pride battle, I&#x27;ll personally give you extra training when you get back. Buzz. Space distorted again and the red figure vanished without a trace just as it had arrived. Only a faint lingering fragrance like the afterglow of a burning flame remains in the air. Call Shinuan let out a long breath and slumped onto the sofa.</p>
<p>Dealing with an eighth realm expert like this is more tiring than fighting 10 women. The oppressive feeling of being crushed at any moment is too torturous. Dragon Lord Akasha, nestled in his arms, lifted her head, her large, watery eyes looking at him with a pleading expression as if seeking praise. Did they perform well just now? Shinyuan looked down at her, a mischievous smile playing on his lips. Good, very good.</p>
<p>That master really caught the empress off guard. He waved his hand dismissively. Go change out of that leather jacket. Change back into your velvet dress and put that crown on your head, too. Since we&#x27;re going to the capital, we need to make a grand entrance.</p>
<p>And that black lace outfit paired with red sold high heels. You absolutely have to wear it. Akasha was taken aback, then gave him a flirtatious glance. Dragon Lord, your taste is truly unique. Stop talking nonsense and hurry up.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll be in the capital in 2 hours, so we need to make the most of our time to review our lessons. Akasha let out a soft cry and swayed her hips as she walked into the lounge. Watching her graceful figure sway back, Shin Yuan stroked his chin, feeling incredibly pleased with himself. However, just as he was preparing to go in and review, &quot;Drop dash.&quot; The large communication screen in front of me suddenly lit up automatically. Leons serious face and Sue Chingus ambiguous smile appeared on the screen at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;Shinuan, pull up your pants first.&quot; Lean&#x27;s first words were a bombshell. I have important business to discuss. Extremely important business. Shin Yuan sat back on the sofa with a helpless expression and straightened his collar. Sisterly, could we please stop interrupting spell-casting at such crucial moments? It&#x27;s easy to develop health problems later on.</p>
<p>Stop being so cheeky. Lean glared at him. The arrangements for this battle of prodigies have already been made. Your identity is that of a special representative of the Umbrella Corporation. Our requirements aren&#x27;t high.</p>
<p>As long as you can get into the top five and qualify for the seventh martial arts academy in the Milky Way starfield ruled by humans, that&#x27;s enough. I heard that the person behind you in the universe has paved the way for you in the universe. As for the champion, Leunigh, don&#x27;t think about it anymore. Saving your life is the most important thing. Top five, Shin Yuan was displeased upon hearing this, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Sister Lee, aren&#x27;t you looking down on me a bit? I&#x27;m a man who has awakened S-level dragon blood and I have a secret weapon that allows me to break through to the fifth realm at any time. Why can&#x27;t I get first place? Let me tell you, I&#x27;m going to the capital this time with the championship in mind. Anyone who gets in my way, I&#x27;ll take them down. Chapter 151. School beauty gun goddess Xiao Hongi.</p>
<p>On the other side of the screen, Li Yun and Su Ching Xu exchanged a glance, both showing an expression that said, &quot;I knew you would say that.&quot; Shinuan, confidence is a good thing, but blind confidence is courting death. Su Ching Zhu adjusted her glasses, pulled up an encrypted document, and projected it directly onto the screen in front of Shinuan. This is the information on several of the top contenders for the championship in this tournament. Take a look first and then you can start making boastful claims. Shinuan glanced at it casually.</p>
<p>His eyes widened instantly upon seeing that glance. What? The name that appeared first surprised him. Chinua. Identity. Disciple of the exquisite war god.</p>
<p>Eldest daughter of theQin family in the capital. Age 19. Talent. Ice Phoenix. SSS rank.</p>
<p>Realm. Fifth realm Grandmaster. Intermediate level. The five realms. Shinyuan pointed at the screen, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Weren&#x27;t they supposed to be geniuses under 30? How come there&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s already at the mid-stage of the fifth realm at just 19? He worked himself to the bone, relying on others for support and using cheat codes. And now he&#x27;s only just reached the threshold of the fourth realm&#x27;s peak. And yet, this 19-year-old girl has already reached the fifth realm. Don&#x27;t rush. Keep reading.</p>
<p>Such added casually. This is all thanks to someone. Thanks to me. Shinuan was taken aback. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Such pointed to a note below the data. Chinua had been stuck at the peak of the fourth realm for several days. Just a few days ago, she received a 5% increase in the genetic potential of the entire nation due to a certain person&#x27;s intervention. She had an instant enlightenment, broke through the bottleneck, and stepped into the realm of a grandmaster. Moreover, due to that 5% potential increase, her SSS level ice phoenix bloodline seems to have undergone some kind of evolution, and her current combat power is probably enough to contend with veteran peak fifth realm experts.</p>
<p>Shinuan. He looked at the screen and felt as if someone had stabbed him in the chest. What the hell is this? I worked so hard to finally get a reward, and it turns out it&#x27;s been used to aid the enemy. Would I say I&#x27;ve shot myself in the foot? Shin Yuan looked at Su Ching Zhu with a resentful expression. Dr.</p>
<p>Su, isn&#x27;t this reward system a bit of a ripoff? Why is it for the entire region? Can it only be enjoyed by people from Umbrella Corporation? Su Ching Xu shrugged, looking completely innocent. It&#x27;s your talent setting. Is it my fault? Besides, didn&#x27;t you enjoy this benefit yourself that night, which is why you broke through? Shinuan was speechless. Besides Chinua, there are two others you should also be careful of. Lean pointed to the two names below.</p>
<p>Her expression solemn. Long san. Identity: Crown Prince of the Imperial Dragon family. Champion of the previous prodigy tournament. Talents: SS grade purple demon I plus SS grade Imperial Dragon Aura.</p>
<p>Dual talents. Age 23. Realm level, fifth realm Grandmaster Peak. Shinuan clutched his chest. The young master double SS talent.</p>
<p>Is this even humanly possible? It&#x27;s not over yet. Su Ching Xus voice sounded almost gloating. This person is your biggest rival this time and currently the favorite to win the championship. When he saw the third person&#x27;s information, he truly felt what immense pressure meant. Xiao Hongi.</p>
<p>Identity: Young Marshall of the Northern Border Army, known as the goddess of guns. Age 22 talent gun soul SS rank mutant realm level fifth realm grandmaster peak battle record she once single-handedly killed a three-headed sixth realm beast king during a beast tide. She is hailed as the future female war goddess of the empire and her strength and prestige even surpassed Long Yings peak of the fifth realm slayed a three-headed sixth realm beast king. Shinuan looked at the line of bright red battle records. His throat went dry.</p>
<p>Ling used her dragon soul battle body to fight desperately and kill three star beasts at the peak of the fifth realm. This Xiao Hongi at only 22 years old can already kill a sixth realm beast king. You should know that the difference in combat power between the fifth and sixth realms is probably starting from a million units of health. What&#x27;s the point of fighting now? You know fear. Looking at Shun Yuans expression, which looked like he&#x27;d swallowed a fly, Lie Yun said earnestly.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans upcoming battle of prodigies has gathered the most elite monsters in the entire empire. Each of them has either fought their way out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood or been forged with massive amounts of resources. Although you have awakened S-level dragon blood, your cultivation time is too short and your foundation is insufficient. Therefore, a top five finish is truly our highest expectation for you. On the other end of the screen, Su Ching Xu added, &quot;Moreover, Xiao Hongi is said to have an even more explosive temper than Ling.</p>
<p>Your flirting techniques will probably not only be useless against her, but she&#x27;ll probably just stab you through the heart.&quot; Shin Yuan fell silent. He leaned back on the sofa, looking at the impressive and powerful names on the screen. And his pride was slightly shaken. It turns out that my perceived strength was still a long way off from that of truly top tier geniuses. Without using Akasha as a cheat, relying solely on raw skill, his chances of winning against these people are probably less than 50%.</p>
<p>Oh Shin Yuan rubbed his face hard and the golden flame in his eyes reignited. Afraid. Ever since the day I awakened the system, I have never known what fear is. So what if you&#x27;re at the fifth realm? So what if you&#x27;ve killed someone at the sixth realm? I have a system. I have cheat codes.</p>
<p>If you swing your hoe, well, no corner is too hard to dig down since we can&#x27;t win by fighting head-on. Then Shin Yuans gaze suddenly fell on the portraits ofQin Shua and Xiao Hongi. One is an ice queen. The other is a fiery female warrior. This configuration looks so familiar.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this just a copy of Ly Yu and Longing? If I can win over two great beauties in the East China Sea, why can&#x27;t I win over these two in the capital? Hey, hey, Shin Yuan suddenly grinned, a smile that was somewhat eerie. Sister Lee, Dr. Sue, please don&#x27;t worry. Top five, that&#x27;s just a safety net. Since they&#x27;re so strong, that&#x27;s perfect.</p>
<p>Shinyuan stood up, stretched his neck, and his joints cracked. It&#x27;s more satisfying to conquer a woman of this caliber. Just then, the door to the lounge opened. Having changed into a black velvet gown, and wearing red sold high heels, Akasha walked out with captivating charm. Dragon Lord, they&#x27;re ready.</p>
<p>Shinuan turned around and looked at the countest who had completely fallen for him, his fighting spirit rising even higher. Perfect timing. I&#x27;m ready, too. He cut off the communication, pulled Akasha into his arms, and looked through the port hole at the increasingly close outline of the capital. 2 hours left.</p>
<p>This amount of time is enough for him to farm another wave of experience points on Akasha. I&#x27;m 50 tries away from the minimum of 100 tries. Akasha, let&#x27;s try something different this time. Shinyuan leaned close to her ear and whispered something. Let&#x27;s practice how to take down a hot-tempered female gunslinger immediately.</p>
<p>Lung Yu and Longing glanced at each other too much. Chapter 152. A storm is brewing in the capital. A goddess host warms up the audience. The capital of the Lshi Empire.</p>
<p>This steel behemoth which has stood in the east of the blue planet for hundreds of years has completely shed its former somnity and heaviness today. Above the azure sky, hundreds of airships bearing the emblems of major conglomerates, military regions, and top universities hovered in the clouds like a pod of whales in the deep sea, blotting out the sun. Countless colorful holographic projections intertwined in the air, turning the entire sky above the capital into a neon colored ocean. In the very center of this bizarre ocean, a giant silver mechanical eyeball with a diameter of over 100 meters, Tanyen.1, floats silently. Its sophisticated lens, like the pupil of a god, overlooks the dragon nest arena below, which can hold 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Everything that happens here will be broadcast live without delay to hundreds of billions of citizens throughout the empire via a quantum network. Sizzle with a soft crackling sound of electricity. The images on all outdoor screens, home terminals, and personal wristbands across the entire empire were forcibly cut off in the same second. Hello everyone watching on your screens. Good morning.</p>
<p>A sweet cloying voice delivered through a full range stereo system instantly resounded throughout the square and into the ears of millions of spectators. Immediately afterwards, a striking figure appeared on the huge holographic projection screen in midair. She was a girl who looked to be only 18 or 19 years old. She had striking pink pigtails, the ends of which swayed gently in the breeze. Her face was so delicate, like a figurine that had stepped out of an anime with big, bright eyes that sparkled with a mischievous charm.</p>
<p>But what truly captivates the eye is definitely not her innocent looking childlike face. instead. As the camera skillfully pans upwards, the first thing that catches the eye is a pair of beautiful legs wrapped in white stockings with wellproportioned and voluuptuous lines. Next is her slender waist, so delicate it could be encircled by a single hand. The final image focuses on the tight fitting crop top that looks like it could burst at any moment.</p>
<p>There was an astonishing curve there, completely at odds with his youthful appearance, enough to make Newton turn in his grave. Glug in the square. Countless hot-blooded young men swallowed hard. The live stream chat exploded instantly, densely covering the screen. What? It&#x27;s Su Xiaoya.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s actually hosting this year&#x27;s event. This is unbearable. The director deserves a bonus. I give this low angle shot full marks. Is this the legendary babyfaced giant cough cough, the epitome of justice? Hey, you upstairs, wipe your drool.</p>
<p>This is the little devil of the Sue family. A flying talent at the early stage of the fourth realm. Be careful. She might just walk over the internet cable and knock your head off. On the screen, Su Xiao seemed to be used to this kind of scene.</p>
<p>She floated in midair with a pair of translucent pink wings that had grown from her back and made a face at the camera, her two little tiger teeth sparkling in the sunlight. Hey guys, in the comments, put away your tissues first. It&#x27;s broad daylight. We should be civilized and set a good example. Su Xiao Yao teased with a grin, her voice crisp and clear.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s highlight isn&#x27;t my legs, and it&#x27;s definitely not here. She even deliberately puffed out her impressive chest, causing a chorus of howls from the crowd. Today is the ultimate showcase for the younger generation of our Dragon Xia Empire. It&#x27;s a pivotal moment for countless geniuses to leap over the Dragon Gate. Su Xiao Yaos expression became slightly more serious, but only a little.</p>
<p>She extended a slender white finger and waved it. However, since it is a grand event for the entire empire, the threshold is naturally frighteningly high. First, you must be under 30 years old. Those older people trying to look younger, don&#x27;t bother trying. Bone age analyzers don&#x27;t recognize beauty filters.</p>
<p>Second, the aura of a fourthrem grand marshall master emanating from Su Xiao Yao was released without reservation. Although it wasn&#x27;t strong, it still created a unique sense of pressure when combined with her floating posture. The cultivation level must not be lower than the initial stage of the fourth realm. In other words, if you can&#x27;t even beat me, then you should go home and drink your milk instead of coming here to embarrass yourself. Upon hearing this, the young martial artists who had been eager to try their luck outside the square immediately wilted like frostbitten eggplants.</p>
<p>The tone of the comments in the live stream also changed. Ouch, that hurts. I&#x27;m 29 this year and only at the peak of the third realm. I was hoping to show my face, but I couldn&#x27;t even beat that pink-haired Loly. Don&#x27;t be discouraged.</p>
<p>Su Xiao Yao is the genius of the Sue family this generation. Although she loves to cause trouble, her strength is real. The threshold for the fourth realm is too high. In previous years, wasn&#x27;t it enough to apply at the third realm? There&#x27;s no way around it. I heard this year is a golden age full of geniuses.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t you see that even the female gunslinger from the north is here? Su Xiao Yao chuckled as she looked at the wailing comments on the screen. All right, all right, enough chitchat. Let&#x27;s see who the first group of handsome young men and beautiful young women to enter today are, making our mouths water. As her words fell, movement finally appeared at the end of the incredibly wide red carpet in front of the Jingua gate. Various luxurious hover cars or figures riding mythical beasts began to appear one after another.</p>
<p>Look, look, that&#x27;s the Lynn family&#x27;s caravan from the southern territory. I heard that the girls they raise using their green with longevity technique are all incredibly beautiful. The camera immediately cut to that. Several women dressed in emerald green dresses with gentle and graceful demeanor walked slowly in surrounded by a group of guards. Although they weren&#x27;t stunning beauties, their gentle Jangan style charm was still a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>Wow, that girl in the leather jacket over there is so cool. Is that an alloy whip she&#x27;s holding? Tsk tsk. If that hits you, he it had definitely hurt a lot, right? While explaining, Su Xiao was driving in a rather unserious manner, and her experienced driver demeanor created a huge and adorable contrast with her appearance. Time passed second by second. More and more talented individuals are appearing, and their strength is increasing.</p>
<p>from barely reaching the fourth realm at the beginning to the middle stage of the fourth realm and even the late stage of the fourth realm. The variety of bizarre talents and dazzling equipment is dazzling, but everyone knows that these are just appetizers. The real feast, those monsters standing at the top of the pyramid, haven&#x27;t even shown themselves yet. Chapter 153. Zhao Yis outrageous remarks shocked the entire internet.</p>
<p>Boom dash. Just then, a roar like that of a wild beast. The deafening roar of an engine arrogantly drowned out all the noise at the scene. All eyes were drawn to the end of the red carpet. A convertible hover car made entirely of pure gold and inlaid with countless gemstones with an exaggerated shape resembling a moving golden dragon sped along the ground, exuding the arrogance of a nuvo ree.</p>
<p>Before the car had even come to a complete stop, both doors opened. Four top models dressed in revealing outfits and with stunning figures jumped down first, then bowed respectfully and extended their hands into the car. A foot wearing a limited edition crocodile leather shoe stepped onto the red carpet. Immediately afterwards, a young man with sllicked back hair, sunglasses, a thick gold chain around his neck, and a cigar in his mouth made a dazzling entrance surrounded by a group of bodyguards. What? Who is this acting so arrogantly? You don&#x27;t recognize him? the son of the richest man in Dong Hai, the leader of the four young masters of Dong Hai, the so-called Zhao Ei, the eldest young master with billions in wealth.</p>
<p>When Su Xiaoa saw the person coming, her eyes lit up. She flapped her wings and flew over with the microphone in her hand. Oh my, isn&#x27;t this our young master? His entrance is still so simple, unpretentious, and boring. Su Xiao Yao landed in front of Zhao E, almost shoving the microphone to his nose and asked with a mischievous grin. Young Master Zhao, I heard you&#x27;re a top seed representing East China Sea this time.</p>
<p>How about it? Are you confident you can get into the top 10? Zhao E took off his sunglasses, revealing a pair of bloodshot but unusually excited eyes. He casually put his arm around two young models beside him, grabbed their waists hard, eliciting giggles, and then arrogantly exhaled a smoke ring at the camera. Top 10. Zhoi chuckled and shook a finger. Su Xiao, you look down on the East China Sea too much.</p>
<p>I, Zhao Ei, am making this clear today. If the championship of this heavenly pride battle doesn&#x27;t belong to our EC, I&#x27;ll eat this golden car right here and now. Wow. The entire audience erupted in uproar. The live stream chat was flooded with arrogant comments and messages of anticipation for being proven wrong.</p>
<p>Su Xiao Yao was also stunned for a moment. Then her face turned red with excitement. Wow, young Masterha, you&#x27;re so confident. Has your strength increased dramatically recently, and you&#x27;ve broken through to the fifth realm? Me? Zhao E grinned, revealing a set of bright white teeth. My meager skills are nothing.</p>
<p>He turned around, pointed to the eastern horizon, and his eyes revealed an almost fanatical worship. I dare to say this because my older brother is here. Compared to my older brother, everyone here is, if I may be so bold, a younger brother. Big brother? Su Xiao blinked her big eyes, her face full of curiosity. Who exactly is this person who can make Zhao E, a top tier rich second generation with an extremely high opinion of himself, willingly call him big brother and praise him so much in public? Young Master Zhao, stop keeping me in suspense.</p>
<p>Who exactly is your elder brother? Is he even more powerful than the heir of the Long Family? Zhao E smiled mysteriously and put his sunglasses back on. What&#x27;s the rush? The main character always makes their appearance last. Just open your eyes wide and wait to see the gods. After saying that, he ignored Su Xiao Yaoas questions, put his arm around the beautiful woman, and swaggered into the venue with an air of nonchalance. All that was left was a bunch of people at the scene, anxiously speculating.</p>
<p>Rumble. Before everyone could recover from Zhao Yis boastful words. A terrifying sonic boom that seemed to tear the sky apart suddenly came from the sky. The sound was so loud that it hurt many people&#x27;s eardrums, and even the red carpet on the ground was trembling slightly. Su Xia Yaos expression changed drastically and she looked up abruptly.</p>
<p>My god, this is in the northern sky. A heavy fighter jet painted in blood red crashed straight down towards the center of the square like a falling meteor accompanied by a rolling shock wave. Are you crazy? That&#x27;s a no-fly zone. Run. You&#x27;re going to crash.</p>
<p>The crowd gasped and scattered. However, just as the fighter jet was less than 100 meters from the ground, a red figure was ejected directly from the cockpit. Bang! The fighter jet was held up in midair by an invisible force, hovering steadily. The red figure, like a javelin, was planted heavily in the center of the square. Thump! The hard alloy floor was actually cracked like a spiderweb by the ground.</p>
<p>The smoke and dust cleared. A young woman dressed in dark red alloy light armor, holding a long black and gold spear, and with her hair tied in a high ponytail, stood proudly at the bottom of the pit. She was tall, standing at 1.75 m. Her armor was not the kind of tight-fitting suit designed for aesthetics, but rather a heavy armor style full of combat marks. There were even dark red blood stains on her shoulder armor and knee pads.</p>
<p>Even so, the armor could not conceal her wild and proud figure, especially her long legs encased in combat boots, which were full of explosive power, as if they could kick a mountain at any moment. She raised her head, revealing a strikingly beautiful face with a fierce and ruthless air about it. Those eyes, sharp as a hawks, swept across the entire room, causing countless men to instinctively lower their heads, unable to meet their gaze. Xiao Hongi, a border soldier in the northern frontier. She slammed her spear heavily onto the ground.</p>
<p>The sound wasn&#x27;t loud, but it was like the clash of metal and stone with extremely strong penetrating power. Who&#x27;s number one? We&#x27;ll only know after we&#x27;ve fought that piece of trash driving that gold car. Tell his older brother to come out here. My spear. Xiao Hongi spear does not kill nameless nobodies.</p>
<p>Impressive side leakage. Ah, it&#x27;s the female gunslinger. Xiao Hongi. This is a true prodigy. This is a true goddess of war.</p>
<p>Zhao was nothing but a clown. Husband in red. Marry me. I don&#x27;t mind marrying into your family. That entrance was so cool.</p>
<p>Jumping out of the plane. Are you crazy? Su Xiao Yao blushed with excitement. This was exactly the kind of show effect she wanted. My god, Miss Xiao Hongi, the daughter of the Northern Commander Mansion, known as the goddess of guns, has arrived. She&#x27;s a super strong expert at the peak of the fifth realm and one of the biggest favorites to win this championship.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, from the west, a vast chanting of Buddhist hymns resounded. A bald young man, shirtless with muscles bulging like granite and skin of bronze hue, walked over barefoot, step by step. With each step he took, the ground trembled slightly. There were no flashy special effects, but the imposing unyielding presence he exuded was breathtaking. The aesthetic monk from the western border, known as the indestructible Iron Mountain.</p>
<p>To the south, sword energy soared into the sky. A young man dressed in a blue robe carrying an ancient sword on his back and with an unbelievably handsome appearance rode a flying sword and came on the wind. He was like a sword immortal who stepped out of an ancient painting, elegant and graceful, eliciting screams from countless girls at the scene. Yu Yun of the Southern War Zone. My goodness, this year&#x27;s competition is truly a battle of gods.</p>
<p>Su Xiao Yao blushed with excitement and spoke rapidly. The lineup of Valkyrie of the north, Vudra of the West, and Swordswoman of the South is practically an all-star team. However, the real climax was yet to come before Su Xiao could finish playing. Chapter 154. Shin Yuan&#x27;s doineering response.</p>
<p>Move the car. A bone chilling cold suddenly enveloped the entire dragon&#x27;s nest. It was a bright and sunny midday, but the temperature in the air suddenly dropped by more than 10°. Many female spectators dressed in light clothing were shivering from the cold, and their breath turned into white mist. There were no fighter jets or airships in the sky.</p>
<p>Only countless ice crystals fell like snowflakes. Under everyone&#x27;s gaze, a transparent ice bridge, entirely formed from solidified ice, stretched from the distant clouds, leading directly to the dragon&#x27;s nest platform. A figure dressed in a snow white cord dress with a cool and aloof temperament like a fairy from the moon walked barefoot down the ice bridge with graceful steps. With each step she took, a crystal clearar ice lotus bloomed on the ice bridge beneath her feet. May every step bring forth lotus blossoms.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the eldest daughter of theqin family in the capital. Chinwa, the personal disciple of the exquisite war god. My goodness, her aura is simply divine, like a fairy descended from heaven. SSS level ice phoenix talent mid-stage of the fifth realm. This is truly a chosen one of heaven.</p>
<p>I heard that she just broke through a few days ago and her strength is unfathomable. This time she did it to bring glory to the goddess of waring long. As Chin Schw landed, the ground within a 10- m radius instantly frosted over her. She didn&#x27;t look at anyone, not even Xiao Hongi, who had provoked everyone. She simply walked quietly to the seat belonging to theqin family and sat down as if all the noise in the world had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, a powerful dragon aura emanating from the royal family suddenly enveloped the entire square. The previously noisy crowd instantly fell silent. From the direction of the capital city, a golden chariot pulled by nine snow white unicorns with dragon bloodlines stepped through the air. A top the chariot sat a young man dressed in a purple gold python robe. His face was as fair as jade, his eyes as bright as stars, and there was a purple vertical line between his eyebrows which faintly radiated a captivating light.</p>
<p>He simply sat there casually, yet he exuded an aura of supreme authority. Long Sha, the crown prince of the long family in the capital and the champion of the previous heavenly pride tournament. The dragon prince. It&#x27;s the dragon prince. So handsome.</p>
<p>This is truly the mark of royalty. The cheers reached their peak, a testament to the home advantage of the locals in Beijing. As Su Xiao Yao watched these god-like figures appear, she felt her voice was about to go horse from shouting. That was amazing. It was like a battle of gods.</p>
<p>The northern frontier gunslinger, ice phoenix, Prince long sha, the mysterious illusionist from the western frontier, and the muscular monster from the southern frontier. This year&#x27;s Battle of the Prodigies is definitely the most prestigious in a century. Long Shao surveyed the entire audience with indifferent eyes, seemingly already accustomed to such cheers. With a gentle wave of his hand, the nine unicorns slowly descended, pulling the chariot. Zhao E just said that the championship this time belongs to Dong Hai.</p>
<p>Longhas voice wasn&#x27;t loud, but it clearly reached the ears of everyone present. A faint mocking smile played on his lips. It seems Dong Hai really has no one left. Only good for empty talk. I&#x27;d like to see what kind of person his so-called big brother really is.</p>
<p>These words instantly ignited a tense atmosphere. Everyone got excited. The Dragon Prince has declared war. Just when everyone was eagerly anticipating how the East China Sea would respond. Buzz.</p>
<p>The sky suddenly darkened. It wasn&#x27;t dark clouds obscuring the sun, but an enormous shadow that enveloped the entire square. Everyone looked up in shock. A colossal jet black fighter jet with a futuristic design that seemed out of place in this era hovered silently above everyone&#x27;s heads just like a silent abyssal beast. This fighter jet is three times larger than the one Xiao Hongi was using earlier.</p>
<p>There were no serial numbers on the fuselof, only a menacing dark gold dragon head emblem. Is that the shadow dragon, the vehicle of that esteemed person? Those who knew its value exclaimed in surprise. The next second, the fighter jet&#x27;s belly hatch opened. A bright red carpet was laid down from midair and stretched all the way to the ground. This spectacle completely overshadowed Long Xiao&#x27;s golden chariot from before.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, three figures emerged from the cabin in the deathly silence. Walking in the middle was a young man wearing a black fitted trench coat. He was tall and handsome with a roguish charm and a nonchalant smile on his face. with his hands in his pockets. He looked so lazy, like he had just woken up and was out for a stroll.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s not the point. The key point is to his left followed a long-legged, mature woman in a black, tight-fitting combat suit. She had an extremely graceful figure, exuded a cold and menacing aura, and carried a heavy battle sword on her shoulder. Longing to his right was a sophisticated woman wearing a black business suit, gold- rimmed glasses, and sheer black stockings. She exuded a cool and aloof aura and was holding a folder in her hand.</p>
<p>Cold Moon. What really made people&#x27;s eyes pop out was the foreign woman who was clinging tightly to his arm, practically hanging on him. She wore a gorgeous and elaborate black velvet gown and a delicate little crown on her head. That face was breathtakingly beautiful with deep features full of exotic charm. But at this moment, this seemingly noble queen was like a docel kitten nestled against the man with a look of infatuation.</p>
<p>Her violet eyes seemed to hold nothing but that man. One man with three beauties. Su Xiao Yao almost dropped the microphone in her hand. She was completely stunned. What&#x27;s going on? Who among those who came to participate in the battle of the prodigies wasn&#x27;t filled with murderous intent.</p>
<p>This guy looks like he&#x27;s on his honeymoon. This is the older brotherho. He was talking about Shin Yuan from the East China Sea. An incredulous murmur erupted from the crowd. This is so pretentious bringing so many women.</p>
<p>Is he here to fight or to choose concubines? Who is that foreign girl? She&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. That figure is just unfair. What a show off. I think he&#x27;s just a pretty face with no substance. Faced with the envious, disdainful, or shocked gazes around them, Shinuan acted as if he hadn&#x27;t seen it.</p>
<p>He stood on the red carpet, looking down at Long Sha, who was sitting in a golden chariot not far away, frowning as he looked at him. Then, in front of everyone, he stretched out his hand. Snap. The crisp sound transmitted throughout the venue via the still operational sound recording equipment echoed throughout the entire venue. Honey, looks like someone&#x27;s not happy about this.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan&#x27;s voice was lazy and carried an arrogant tone that seemed to invite a beating. Go tell the driver. This road is mine. Shiny Yuan&#x27;s the only one open. Make him move his car.</p>
<p>Chapter 155. The dragon lord this counter spoke of. The crisp sound in the deathly silent dragon&#x27;s nest square was even more ear-catching than the sonic boom when Xiao Hongi appeared earlier. The chat in the live stream froze instantly. Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>That man, that man who, besides being handsome, seemed to be all that was arrogant. How dare they do that in front of hundreds of billions of viewers across the entire empire on that breathtakingly beautiful foreign beauty. Even more outrageous, the woman&#x27;s eyes held an even stronger allure. Akasha von Rothschild, the beauty who had been clinging to Shin Yuan like a docel kitten, slowly straightened up. She extended her long, slender, jade-like fingers and elegantly gathered her slightly disheveled wine red hair at her temples, her violet eyes narrowing slightly.</p>
<p>Their gaze shifted from Shun Yuan&#x27;s face to the golden chariot that stood across the center of the red carpet. In an instant, his demeanor changed drastically. That delicate little kitten is gone. The blood rose countest who stirred up trouble in the Federation and treated human life like dirt has returned. Since the dragon lord has spoken, Akasha parted her red lips slightly.</p>
<p>Her voice languid yet carrying a chill that seeped into her bones. She took a step, her signature red sold high heels clicking crisply on the hard alloy floor. Every step seemed to tread on the heartbeat of every male creature, the hips swaying with astonishing amplitude, yet exuding an elegance and arrogance etched into the very bones. Her black velvet gown billowed with each step like a black rose blooming in the dark night. The skirt has an extremely high slit.</p>
<p>As she moved, her plump thighs, tightly encased in black lace stockings, were faintly visible. The delicate and intricate lace pattern pierced into her fair and soft flesh, creating a highly aggressive beauty. The Adam&#x27;s apples bobbed wildly in the square, and their eyes were practically glued to those legs. Those legs? I could play with those legs for my next life. Is this the countest? Her aura is so powerful.</p>
<p>Just a moment ago, she was a little lamb in that man&#x27;s arms. How did she turn into a queen the moment she stepped down? These high heels aren&#x27;t stepping on a carpet. They&#x27;re stepping on my life. Damn it, who exactly is this Shinuan? How come beauties of this caliber are all so obedient to him? Amidst the sounds of swallowing hard, Akasha had already reached the extremely luxurious golden chariot. She merely raised her delicate chin slightly and glanced at the imposing imperial crown prince on the chariot with the look one would give a dog blocking the road.</p>
<p>Hey, you driving? Akasha&#x27;s voice recorded by the on-site sound equipment reached everyone&#x27;s ears. Didn&#x27;t you hear what my dragon lord said? A good dog doesn&#x27;t block the way. Move your broken car. A beatup car. The entire audience erupted in uproar.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a golden chariot, a symbol of royal majesty pulled by nine unicorns with dragon blood. In this woman&#x27;s mouth, it actually became a broken down car blocking the way. On the chariot, Long Sha, who had been indifferent, suddenly narrowed his bright star-like eyes. He wasn&#x27;t the kind of spoiled brat who couldn&#x27;t resist beautiful women. As the most outstanding heir of the long family in this generation, he possessed his own pride and integrity.</p>
<p>But he is also a strong person with keen insight. The moment Akasha approached, the purple vertical line between his eyebrows began to throb violently, an instinctive warning when encountering an extremely dangerous target. Akasha, the first in line to the Federal Rothschild family. Long Sha stood up, his purple gold python robe fluttering without wind and a vast imperial aura instantly erupted, rivaling the cold blood energy emanating from Akasha. He recognized her as one of the future successors of the Empire.</p>
<p>How could he not know this enchantress of the Federation? What audacity. Liaos voice was like a resounding bell, so powerful that the heirs seemed to buzz. As a high-ranking official from an enemy country and a grandmaster at the peak of the fifth realm, how dare you swagger into the heart of my dragon empire and even dare to spout nonsense here? What do you think? Lia has no one to rely on. With this angry shout, purple energy rose around Long Sha, faintly transforming into a giant purple dragon that coiled behind him. His eyes held no grief for beauty, only a steely resolve and murderous intent towards his enemies.</p>
<p>Guards, seize this woman. Since you&#x27;ve come to us, you&#x27;re not going anywhere. Facing Long Sha directly, Akasha covered her mouth and chuckled as if she had heard a funny joke. Cluck, cluck. Her laughter was charming and seductive, yet tinged with contempt.</p>
<p>Take me down. You think you can? Akasha&#x27;s beautiful eyes darted around, scrutinizing Long Sha from head to toe, finally settling on the vertical line between his brows, a mocking smile playing on her lips. Little brother, although your appearance is passable, barely pleasing to the eye, you think you can touch this Earl? You&#x27;re still too green. Apart from my dragon lord, there is no other man in this world worthy of my attention. Before she finished speaking, an even more powerful aura suddenly erupted from her seemingly delicate body.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not the fifth realm. That&#x27;s the domain power unique to a sixth realm marshall king. The once clear sky seemed to be instantly stained with a layer of blood, and countless elucory blood red roses bloomed at Akashas feet. The terrifying sense of oppression directly pushed back the imperial dragon aura on Longho&#x27;s body. Six Realms.</p>
<p>Longho&#x27;s expression changed drastically, and the veins on the back of his hand gripping the chariot&#x27;s armrest bulged. The intelligence was wrong. This demonness has actually broken through. Just when tensions were running high and a top level battle seemed imminent on the red carpet. Stop.</p>
<p>Stop. All of you. Stop. A pink figure flapped its wings of light and rushed into the vortex of energy between the two. Su Xiao Yao held the microphone in her hand, her face pale, and she stamped her feet anxiously.</p>
<p>This is the entrance ceremony for the Battle of the Prodigies. Not a gladiatorial arena. According to the tournament rules, nonparticipants are not allowed to fight inside the arena. Private duels are strictly prohibited. She turned to Akasha and forcing a smile, called out, &quot;Sister, although you are beautiful, this is Lia.</p>
<p>Please follow the rules.&quot; Rule. Akasha casually fiddled with her freshly done manicure without even lifting her eyelids. The word rules does not exist in this Earl&#x27;s dictionary. She stretched out her finger and tapped Long Xiao&#x27;s nose from a distance, her tone extremely doineering. His beat up car was blocking my dragon lord&#x27;s way.</p>
<p>Since he wouldn&#x27;t move it, I&#x27;ll help him dismantle it. That&#x27;s called clearing the way. You Su Xiaoa was furious. This woman is so stubborn and the dragon lord. Su Xiaoa was full of questions and the millions of viewers in the live stream were also completely baffled.</p>
<p>Who exactly is the dragon lord? This beautiful woman keeps calling him the dragon lord. It&#x27;s making me swoon. The only person with the surname Long present is the young master of the Long family, right? But judging from the situation, it doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re calling him. Blind student, you&#x27;ve spotted the key point. Didn&#x27;t this beautiful woman just emerged from the arms of that handsome guy in the black trench coat? Could that guy be called the dragon lord? Holy crap, that title is way too childish.</p>
<p>Anyone who didn&#x27;t know better would think he was some kind of 11th realm star-lord ruling some galaxy. This isn&#x27;t how you show off. Chapter 156. Akashas contrast who is envious just as the situation reached a stalemate and Long Sha was prepared to suppress this federal vixen who dared to act recklessly in the capital regardless of the cost. Akasha a soft voice drifted over from behind.</p>
<p>The voice was flat, even carrying a hint of sleepiness. Yet it was like an invisible imperial edict precisely reaching the countess&#x27;s ears. Just two words. The illusion of countless blood red roses along with the overwhelming pressure of the sixth realm that terrified even fifth realm grand masters vanished in an instant, absorbed back into her body as if it had never existed. There was not a trace of grievance, nor the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>Akasha turned around and the frost on her cold and aloof face quickly melted away, transforming into an almost burning devotion and obsession. Her violet eyes reflected only the image of the man with his hands in his pockets and a lazy expression. She walked back to Shin Yuan&#x27;s side with elegant yet deadly cat-like steps. The heels of her high heels tapped on the ground. Each step a graceful sway, her voluuptuous curves beneath the black velvet dress even more captivating than when she exuded a murderous aura.</p>
<p>She pressed her soft, boneless body tightly against Shun Yuans arm, tilting her breathtaking face slightly upwards, her red lips close to his ear, her breath coming in a languid, sticky whisper. Dragon Lord, do you find this troublesome fellow annoying because he&#x27;s dirtying your path? This isn&#x27;t complaining. It&#x27;s clearly asking for instructions. If he nods, she will not hesitate to tear the obstacle in front of her along with the person and the car to pieces. The millions of viewers in the live stream were once again stunned.</p>
<p>What a contrast. Just a moment ago, she was a bloodthirsty queen, and now she&#x27;s a caring secretary. This woman is so perceptive. She wasn&#x27;t being coetish. She was asking the owner if they wanted the trash cleaned up.</p>
<p>Damn, this is a top tier beauty. She&#x27;s as to outsiders, but am to her master. How did that Shin Yuan manage to do that? Shin Yuan looked down at the woman in his arms, whose very nature was obedience, and a helpless yet triumphant smile appeared on his face. He extended his fingertip and gently lifted her delicate chin. We&#x27;re here to compete, not to demolish buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;If I this young master now and he goes to the arena later, won&#x27;t people say that I, Shin Yuan, won unfairly and that I am bullying disabled people?&quot; Akasha blinked, a hint of regret flashing in her purple eyes, which quickly turned into absolute obedience as she nodded obediently. We will obey the dragon lord&#x27;s orders. Shin Yuan finally released his grip with satisfaction, his gaze passing over her to Long Sha, whose face was alternating between pale and flushed, and the playful smile on his lips deepened. Besides, Shinuans voice rose a few decibels. We not only want to win, but we want to win convincingly to win them completely.</p>
<p>Let him park his car there for now. We&#x27;ll see after the fight is over. He paused, then added lazily. It&#x27;s still uncertain who will get this car. Matt, this isn&#x27;t just arrogance.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s blatant contempt. He not only wants to win, but also wants to take the dragon family&#x27;s young master&#x27;s car as a trophy. Shinyuan, right? Good. Very good. The vertical line on Long Xiao&#x27;s forehead, resembling the purple demon eye, almost burst open.</p>
<p>This man is not only arrogant but also exudes an eerie aura. The fact that he could make a sixth realm marshall king like Akasha submit to him shows that his methods are definitely not as simple as they appear. Long Sha laughed in fury. I will tear your mouth apart on the stage. I hope you&#x27;ll still be as arrogant then.</p>
<p>After saying that, he snorted coldly, waved his sleeve, and the nine-headed divine unicorn let out a long, unwilling roar, pulling the golden chariot into the sky and flying directly into the depths of the venue. He didn&#x27;t want to waste another word on this guy who only knew how to hide behind women. With the departure of the golden chariot, the red carpet was finally empty. Shinyuan yawned, his left hand naturally wrapping around Akasha&#x27;s soft waist, while his right hand beckoned to Ling and L Yu. Let&#x27;s go inside and see what&#x27;s fun.</p>
<p>He swaggered on and continued walking. His demeanor made it seem as if he were the true master of this place. And at this very moment, as the camera zoomed in, Shin Yuan&#x27;s face was finally clearly displayed on the screens of hundreds of billions of viewers across the empire. After a brief silence, the chat room exploded with excitement. What? I remember now.</p>
<p>This guy looks so familiar. That looks familiar, too. Wait, isn&#x27;t this that frank joke from over a month ago at the East China Sea Awakening Plaza? Yes, yes, yes, it&#x27;s him, Shinuan. Back then, the whole internet was mocking him for awakening some kind of lucky talent. Oh my god, is it really him? How long has it been? How could he have changed like this? In a high-end residential community in Dongghai City, a young girl dressed in loungewear is sitting cross-legged on the sofa watching a live stream.</p>
<p>When she saw the smug man on the screen surrounded by women on either side, the potato chips in her hand fell to the ground with a thud. Shinshin. The girl&#x27;s mouth was wide open and her pupils were trembling. Her name is Liian. She was Shin Yuans high school classmate and one of the most beautiful girls in the class.</p>
<p>A month ago, when Shin Yuan&#x27;s awakening of his F-level talent became a laughingtock, her parents joked that since Shin Yuan had such a lucky talent, why not recruit him as a son-in-law? At least they could guarantee he would give birth to a big healthy boy. What did Lie Chin say at the time? She threw Shun Yuan&#x27;s photo into the trash can with a look of disgust, saying, &quot;Marrying such a piece of trash? I&#x27;d rather marry a dog. With F-level talent, he&#x27;ll only ever be a piece of scum at the bottom of society, not even worthy of carrying my shoes.&quot; But now on the screen, the man she once considered trash was now wearing a well-tailored hot coutur trench coat, exuding a sinister aura that made people weak in the knees. The women around him, the foreign countess who was holding his arm could steal a man&#x27;s soul with just one glance. That tall, leggy female officer carrying a sword was so dashing and heroic that it made one feel ashamed of oneself.</p>
<p>That bespectled, sophisticated woman exuded an air of unapproachable elite. Any one of them, whether it&#x27;s looks, figure, or temperament, could easily dwarf Leian. Not to mention the status and power that man is currently displaying. How could someone make the dragon clan&#x27;s crown prince, a peak fifth realm cultivator, suffer a setback? What could possibly make a countest from the six realms act coetishly and call someone master in public? How could this be an F-class loser? This is clearly a hidden dragon emerging from the abyss. Was it me back then? Liian stared at the screen, her pretty face deathly pale and the word regret almost overflowing from her eyes.</p>
<p>If she hadn&#x27;t refused back then, if she had taken the initiative, could it be that she is the woman standing beside that man now, enjoying the spotlight and being envied by the entire empire? With trembling hands, she picked up her personal terminal and frantically searched through her contact list. But how could she possibly find the name she had personally deleted? It&#x27;s not just lien. Throughout Don High City, countless people who had once mocked Shin Yuan now felt a burning pain on their faces. The tone of the comments in the live stream quickly shifted from initial shock to a screen full of sour grapes. Damn it.</p>
<p>Who said F-class is trash? Step forward and take your beating. This is trash. This is life&#x27;s winner. I want this kind of trash talent, too. Wake up upstairs.</p>
<p>You need to have the ability to handle it first. Didn&#x27;t you see Shinuan&#x27;s aura right now? That&#x27;s the peak of the fourth realm. Going from F rank to the peak of the fourth realm in just one month. That&#x27;s an astonishing leveling speed. Even a rocket couldn&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, this guy&#x27;s got a weird vibe. And have you noticed how much those goddesses are eyeing him? They&#x27;re practically drooling. Especially that foreign countess. She looks like she wants to devour him. Stop talking.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so jealous. Shin yuan. The grudge of having your wife stolen is irreconcilable. Although those goddesses weren&#x27;t originally mine anyway. Inside the dragon&#x27;s nest arena.</p>
<p>As Shan Yuan and his group entered the contestant passage, the noise of the scene seemed to be shut out from them. Not far away, Ziao Hongi, the northern frontier gun goddess who had just made a powerful entrance, was leaning against the wall, wiping her black and gold spear. She raised her eyelids, glanced at Shin Yuans back, and a disdainful sneer curled at the corner of her mouth. A attention-seeking jigalo. Meanwhile, in another corner in the VIP seats on the deis, Chinua, who had remained as aloof as an iceberg throughout, showed a barely perceptible ripple in her cold eyes as Shin Yuan&#x27;s figure disappeared into the passageway.</p>
<p>Her icy blue pupils seemed to pierce through space and land on Akasha beside Shin Yuan. Then, it slowly moved onto Shun Yuan&#x27;s body. Scumbag. Chapter 157. There&#x27;s a rich woman in space.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s got her eye on Shin Yuan&#x27;s good kidneys. It&#x27;s out. Let me catch up on the previous plot. Outside the atmosphere of Earth at an altitude of 30,000 mi. This is an absolute vacuum.</p>
<p>A dead zone where even the light seems exceptionally glaring. A silver gray interstellar warship thousands of meters long is quietly hovering in its synchronous orbit. It resembled a giant steel whale from deep space. It&#x27;s all adorned with a deep blue energy shield that deflected all the cosmic rays powerful enough to tear apart Aloy. Inside the bridge command room, a huge holographic projection screen occupies an entire wall.</p>
<p>The screen displayed a live feed of the Dragon Nest Arena, the capital of the Dragon CI Empire, below with such clarity that you could even see the pores on everyone&#x27;s face. Three people dressed in speciallymade silver white uniforms are standing in front of the screen on their chests. Each wore a uniquely shaped badge, seven stars surrounded by nebula. This signifies that it is one of the seven great martial arts holy lands within the human race&#x27;s territory. The seventh martial arts academy, this year&#x27;s batch of local talents is quite interesting.</p>
<p>The speaker was a burly middle-aged man with a full beard and a deep booming voice. He pointed to the image of Long Shiao driving away in a golden chariot on the screen and nodded slightly. That kid from the long family has already opened the second stage of the purple demon eye and his imperial dragonqi is also taking shape as long as he doesn&#x27;t die halfway. Entering the inner courtyard shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. A tall thin man with a refined demeanor wearing a monle smiled and lightly swiped his finger across the screen.</p>
<p>Freezing the image on Xiao Hongi who was dressed in red armor and holding a long spear. I think this girl is quite good. Her gunmanship is restrained yet decisive. This kind of practical fighter who has been through countless battles is more resilient than those privileged science raised on resources. If she passes the entrance exam, I&#x27;d like to recruit her into my combat and mage department.</p>
<p>The two made their comments in a fairly polite tone, but their inherent sense of superiority and condescension was impossible to hide. To them, Earth was just a marginal planet that had only recently begun to recover. The so-called prodigy here placed within the vast human realm of the universe would at most be a country bumpkin until the tall thin man swiped his finger again and the scene cut to the girl in the white dress sitting alone in the corner surrounded by frost on the ground. Huh? The two of them simultaneously let out a soft exclamation. Is this girl only 19 years old by bone age? The burly man stared wideeyed at the data panel beside him, somewhat incredulous.</p>
<p>mid-stage of the fifth realm. And this chilling aura comes from a pure-blooded ice phoenix physique. A data stream flashed across the tall, thin man&#x27;s glasses, and his expression turns serious. He possesses an SSS level ice phoenix bloodline, and his awakening level is extremely high. At 19 years old, reaching the mid-stage of the fifth realm, this speed would place him among the top, even at our academyy&#x27;s main campus.</p>
<p>How could such a monstrous talent be born on this tiny blue planet? It seems this trip wasn&#x27;t in vain. The burly man grinned. This Chinua is mine. I&#x27;ll fight anyone who tries to take her from me. The two argued endlessly, but they completely ignored Shin Yuan, who was making the biggest commotion and had women on both sides right in the center of the screen.</p>
<p>Inside their highdimensional detector, Shin Yuan&#x27;s data panel was in a terrible state. Frank talent. The notes stated that it was an extremely rare reproductive lineage. However, in a universe where martial arts reigns supreme, such talent usually only makes one a tool for powerful families and is completely overlooked by these martial arts instructors. Okay, stop arguing.</p>
<p>A languid, slightly magnetic, mature female voice came from the shadows behind the two. The conductor&#x27;s chair rotates. A stunningly beautiful woman dressed in a deep purple highlit Chong Sam and holding a glass of scarlet liquid appeared in their line of sight. She didn&#x27;t look at Chinua, nor did she look at Long Sha. Those alluring eyes were intently fixed on the man on the screen who had his hand on Akashas waist.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x27;s Chinua or Xiao Hongi, they are your targets. The beautiful woman stuck out the tip of her tongue and licked the rim of the cup. A very alluring gesture. As for this little guy named Shin Yuan, he&#x27;s mine. Yours? The burly man and the tall, thin man exchanged a glance, both seeing shock in each other&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>This an is known throughout the academy for her discerning eye and her cultivation method is extremely unique. This time she actually took a fancy to an frrank native teacher huah. This kid is indeed quite handsome but his talent. The tall thin man hesitated for a moment but still offered his advice. Frank really what&#x27;s wrong with F-class? The beautiful woman known as the flower mentor chuckled softly, her gaze lingering on Shun Yuan&#x27;s tall and straight figure, his firm waist and abdomen, and his bright and spirited eyes.</p>
<p>What do you know? That person specifically instructed me to come here in person just for this little guy. She put down her wine glass, leaned forward slightly, and stared at the several stunning beauties around Shin Yuan, a glint of shrewdness flashing in her eyes. To be able to handle so many exceptional women at this age and still maintain such abundant energy and vitality without any signs of depletion. That&#x27;s remarkable. This little guy&#x27;s kidneys are a once in a millennium wonder.</p>
<p>And she recalled the top secret information the important figure had given her before her departure and smiled mysteriously. F- level reproductive talent, huh? That&#x27;s just the surface. You won&#x27;t find another person in the entire universe who can develop that talent to such an abnormal degree. This time I have to teach him properly what the true path is. Let&#x27;s bring our gaze back to the ground.</p>
<p>The entrance to Lcha Plaza. After Shin Yuan finished slapping Akasha, he was about to swag her inside with his arm around her when a pink after image suddenly descended from the sky and blocked his way. Stop. Stop. Stop.</p>
<p>Break. Break right now. Su Xiao flapped her pink wings of light, almost shoving the microphone in her hand into Shun Yuan&#x27;s chin. Her big eyes were wide open, staring at Shin Yuan and his family as if they were aliens. Hey, Shin Yuan, do you think this is a shopping mall or a beach vacation? Su Xiao pointed to Ling, Lung Yu, and Akasha, who was clinging to him behind him, looking speechless.</p>
<p>This is the battle of the prodigies. It is the most serious martial arts competition in the entire empire. Apart from the contestants and staff, no unauthorized personnel are allowed to enter. Are you bringing so many family members here so they can cheer you on from below the ring? Shinyuan stopped and looked down at the pink-haired lowly who only reached his chest and grinned. As the host of this event, I can eat whatever I want, but I can&#x27;t say whatever I want.</p>
<p>He pointed to Longing, who stood beside him with a cold expression. This longing is a legitimate contestant from the Southern Border Protection Umbrella Company, a top expert in the mid-stage of the fifth realm. You can&#x27;t possibly stop her, can you? Su Xiao Yao glanced at Long Ying and shrank back. She had certainly heard of Long Yings name, and her murderous aura was undeniable, so she nodded. Of course, a genius like L can get in.</p>
<p>That settles it. Shinuan spread his hands and pointed to himself. I am the special representative of Umbrella Corporation, and I was personally invited. I have special privileges, so there is no problem with that, right? This Su Xiaoa hesitated for a moment, then remembered the instructions from above. There was indeed a special invitation slot available.</p>
<p>Okay, you count as one, too. Chapter 158. Bringing a secretary to a competition. What about these two? Su Xiao handed the microphone to Lung Yu. Today, Lung Yu wore an extremely fitted black business suit with gold rimmed glasses perched on her nose and a folder in her hand, looking every bit the aloof and cold female secretary.</p>
<p>However, her long black stocking legs beneath the skirt were simply too eye-catching, captivating many of the male contestants nearby. &quot;This is my personal secretary,&quot; Miss Lung Yu Shin Yuan shamelessly introduced. &quot;You know, I&#x27;m very busy with work, making millions every minute. I don&#x27;t feel at ease without a secretary by my side to help me with documents, serve tea and water, and massage my legs. Cold moon.&quot; A cold glint flashed in her icy blue eyes behind her glasses and she wished she could slap the folder onto Shun Yuans irritating face.</p>
<p>Who massaged her legs? Have you no shame? Su Xiao Yaos lips twitched. Bringing a secretary to a martial arts competition, that&#x27;s something else entirely. However, considering that Lyu didn&#x27;t exude much killing intent and was only a fifth level grandmaster, he could barely get away with it. And what about this one? Su Xiao Yao finally asked the most crucial and also the most difficult question. She pointed at Akasha.</p>
<p>If I&#x27;m not mistaken, this should be Countis Akasha of the Rothschild family of the Free Commonwealth, right? Su Xiaos voice turned serious and the surrounding security personnel tinsed up instantly, their hands on their weapons. Mr. Shan, you are a specially invited representative, but Miss Akasha&#x27;s status is unusual. She is a high-ranking official from an enemy country and she should also be a prisoner of war. Right? According to the competition rules, prisoners of war must be held in designated areas and are strictly prohibited from entering the core competition venue, let alone strolling around like this.</p>
<p>If Akasha were to carry out some kind of terrorist attack or take a hostage on the spot, what would become of the Dragon Sa Empire&#x27;s reputation? Prisoners of war. Shinuan reached out and wrapped his arm around Akashas slender waist, pulling her closer to him in front of everyone. Miss Su, you&#x27;re a bit out of touch with the times. Who told you she was a prisoner of war? Shiny Yuan patted Akasha on the shoulder and said with a smile, &quot;Come on, baby. Tell this host, what is your current identity?&quot; Akasha raised her head in perfect unison, her violet eyes filled with fascination, &quot;I am the Dragon Lord&#x27;s secret weapon.</p>
<p>the most obedient little kitten specially designed to help the dragon lord clear all obstacles. After saying that, she made an extremely alluring expression at Su Xiao Yao Puff Dash. Countless audience members who were drinking water sprayed it out. What the hell is this secret weapon? What the hell is that kitten? This is the famous blood rose of the Federation. She&#x27;s a ruthless, bloodthirsty female demon.</p>
<p>Su Xiaos worldview was shattered. No, that won&#x27;t do. Even though Su Xiao Yao was stunned by the shock, she couldn&#x27;t compromise on matters of principle. She spread her arms wide like a little hen protecting her food, blocking Shin Yuans way. No matter what kind of cat or dog she is, as long as she is a citizen of the Federation, and as long as she has not undergone the highest level of review by the Imperial Security Bureau, she is absolutely not allowed to enter the dragon&#x27;s nest.</p>
<p>This is a direct order. If we let her in and something happens, who will be responsible? The air around them grew tense. Those geniuses who were originally just watching the spectacle also turned their attention over. Shinuan looked at the pink-haired lowly in front of him who wouldn&#x27;t give an inch and felt a bit of a headache. This little girl is quite stubborn.</p>
<p>Forcing our way in is definitely not an option. This is the capital city after all. If a fight really breaks out, those big shots sitting on the clouds could probably slap me to death with one slap. Well, Shin Yuan sighed deeply, his face showing an expression of great injustice. He suddenly tilted his head back, looked up at the azure sky, and began to howl at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>Old Sheen, you have to do me a favor. You sent me to the capital, and what happened? They won&#x27;t even let me through the gate. I risked everything, even my virtue, to infiltrate the enemy&#x27;s lair, and finally managed to win over this powerful expert at the sixth realm to become my henchmen. Was it easy for me? Now this little girl is actually trying to confiscate my secret weapon. I&#x27;m not participating in this competition.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going back to Donghai to take care of my kids. I can&#x27;t stand this injustice. That shout was full of energy and full of emotion. It&#x27;s absolutely heartbreaking to hear and makes people cry. Everyone in the audience was stunned.</p>
<p>Is this guy trying to scam me? Even sacrificing one&#x27;s looks. I see you&#x27;re enjoying yourself. Su Xiao Yao was also stunned by this turn of events and was about to speak up in rebuttal. rumble. The once clear sky was suddenly filled with a low rumble of thunder.</p>
<p>That wasn&#x27;t thunder from nature. It was a massive suffocating Marshall will that echoed across the sky. Immediately afterwards, an elucory image of an old man dressed in a simple Jehong Sean suit holding a purple clay teacup appeared out of thin air above the dragon&#x27;s nest. The phantom was 100 ft tall. Old Sheen, a rogue cultivator at the Ninth Realm who has never had any background from childhood to old age.</p>
<p>The entire audience of 100,000 along with those arrogant geniuses stood up in unison the moment they saw this figure, their expressions solemn. Old Chen, a thunderous roar of greetings echoed through the sky. This is the highest respect we can pay to the strongest beings in the ninth realm. The elucory figure of Chen in midair glanced helplessly at Shun Yuan, who was throwing a tantrum on the ground. He took a sip of tea, a hint of a smile flashing in his cloudy yet deep eyes.</p>
<p>Okay, stop howling, old man. I&#x27;m here. Shun Yuan immediately shut up. The agrieved expression on his face vanished instantly, replaced by a playful grin and waved at the phantom in the sky. What do you think of this? Approved.</p>
<p>Old Sheen uttered two words calmly. Since you&#x27;ve already tamed that federal girl, let her follow you. But Old Sheen&#x27;s gaze fell on Akasha, and his tone suddenly became sharp. Now that you&#x27;ve entered the gates of Lshia, you must abide by Lshias rules. If one dares to have even the slightest disloyalty, no need for this brat to lift a finger, I&#x27;ll personally send you on your way.</p>
<p>Before she could finish speaking, a terrifying pressure from a ninth realm demagod instantly locked onto Akasha. Akasha&#x27;s body trembled and all the color drained from her beautiful face. If she dares to have even the slightest wicked thought, that seemingly kind old man could absolutely obliterate her in a fraction of a second. Akasha understood. She lowered her head and respectfully bowed to the sky.</p>
<p>Old Sheen nodded, and the elucory figure slowly dissipated. Only one profound sentence remained, echoing in the air. Kid, if you don&#x27;t get that ticket back, you&#x27;re in for a world of hurt. As Elder Chin&#x27;s elucory figure disappeared, the scene fell into a deathly silence. Everyone looked at Shin Yuan as if he were a monster.</p>
<p>Not only did ElderQ personally appear, but he also tacitly approved ofQin&#x27;s behavior of parading around with a sixth level expert from an enemy country. Just who exactly is Shin Yuan? Su Xiao was also completely bewildered. She looked at the sky, then at Shun Yuan&#x27;s smug expression, and finally could only sigh helplessly and step aside to make way. Since that&#x27;s the case, please come in. Hei, thank you so much, Miss Su.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan was now trembling with fear. He straightened his collar, put his left arm around Akasha, and waved his right hand at L Yu and Longing. Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go in and wreak havoc. Chapter 159.</p>
<p>First level rules. Pay to win player, Young Master Zhao. As soon as I entered the venue, I was overwhelmed by the deafening roar. The huge circular arena was packed to capacity. The most eye-catching area, of course, is the central seating area reserved for the most outstanding talents from all sides.</p>
<p>At this time, Chinua, Xiao Hongi, Long Shiao, and other top talents have already taken their seats. When Shun Yuan walked in with Akasha, this outlier, the atmosphere in the entire contestants area instantly became subtle. Countless gazes, sharp as knives and swords, pierced Shin Yuan in unison. There was curiosity, disdain, hostility, and deep-seated fear. Shin Yuan, however, seemed completely oblivious.</p>
<p>He swaggered to his seat in the East China Sea Theater. There was originally only one spot reserved for Longing here. But who is Shinuan? He kicked aside the chair next to him that belonged to a certain small war zone and then sat down with an air of nonulence. Secretary Long, pour some tea. Shinuan crossed his legs and snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Lung Yu took a deep breath, suppressing the urge to smash the thermos over his head and poured him a glass of water with a cold face. Akasha giving a shoulder massage. Yes, Dragon Lord. Akasha immediately and obediently went behind him. Her soft boneless hands resting on his shoulders, massaging them with just the right amount of force.</p>
<p>She was almost pressed against his back, and her fragrance wafted into the noses of those around her. This smooth and effortless maneuver left all the serious and composed young talents around them dumbfounded. Big brother, this is a martial arts tournament. Do you think this is your backyard? Not far away, at the northern seat, Xiao Hongi, dressed in red armor, looked at Shun Yuans spoiled and arrogant demeanor with a look of utter disgust that was almost overflowing. Shameless, she snorted coldly and slammed her black and gold spear heavily on the ground.</p>
<p>This kind of good for nothing who rose to power by relying on women doesn&#x27;t deserve to sit with us. The sound was heard by Shinuan. Shinuan was enjoying Akasha&#x27;s services when he heard this. He slowly picked up his teacup, took a sip, and then turned his head to look at Xiaoani. My gaze lingered for two seconds on the voluuptuous figure encased in that tight-fitting armor before finally settling on that strikingly handsome face.</p>
<p>This beautiful lady in red, &quot;Please don&#x27;t get so angry,&quot; Shinuan said with a smile. &quot;I see that your forehead is dark and your lips are dry, which are obvious signs of endocrine imbalance and inyong imbalance.&quot; or Shinuan put down his teacup and pointed to himself. After the match, come to my room. This legendary healer&#x27;s ancestral massage techniques are a cure for all kinds of indigestion and inyong imbalances. It will cure your ailment and leave you radiant.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re asking for it? Xiao Hongi instantly lost her temper. Who is she? The northern gunslinger. Who would dare speak to her like that? Boom. A violent spear intent erupted from her body, and the black and gold spear let out a dragon&#x27;s roar, its tip pointing directly at Shun Yuans brow. A major battle was imminent.</p>
<p>Shinua, who had been sitting in the corner with her eyes closed, suddenly opened them. There was no emotion in those icy blue eyes. She merely glanced at Shun Yuan indifferently, and then, &quot;Boring!&quot; He uttered two words. The tense atmosphere around them was instantly frozen by an extreme chill. Xiao Hongs intent to use the spear was forcibly suppressed.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan also raised an eyebrow. Such intense cold. This girl&#x27;s got something special. He turned to look at Chinua. It met those emotionless icy blue eyes.</p>
<p>Their eyes met. Indifferent woman. Dead scumbag. All right. All right.</p>
<p>Everyone calm down. Seeing that the situation was about to get out of control again, Su Xiao quickly flapped her wings and flew to the top of the arena. She turned the microphone in her hand to the maximum volume, making everyone&#x27;s eardrums buzz. This is a professional competition, not a street brawl. If you want to prove your awesome, then show us your true skills.</p>
<p>With a wave of her hand, the once flat arena floor rumbled and collapsed in the center. Then a hundred huge cages made of special alloys slowly rose up. Inside the cage were various grotesque star beasts, exuding a savage aura. Some were engulfed in flames. Some had wings on their backs and spewed poisonous mist, and some had three heads, frantically banging against the railings and roaring.</p>
<p>A strong, fishy stench and a menacing aura instantly filled the entire area. The rules for the first level are simple. Hunt. Su Xiao Yao pointed at the cages and called out in her clear voice. Listen up if you don&#x27;t want to be a pushover.</p>
<p>Everyone must choose a star beast for a one-on-one duel. Moreover, the star beast level must be at least one small step higher than your own cultivation level. For example, if you are at the early stage of the fourth realm, then you have to fight someone at the middle stage of the fourth realm. If you dare to choose someone of the same or lower level, you will be eliminated immediately. The final score is calculated based on the level gap you overcome, your kill speed, and your overall combat performance.</p>
<p>The announcement of the rule caused an uproar in the audience. a challenge beyond one&#x27;s level. For ordinary martial artists, this is a life or death question. Star beasts have thick hides and strong vitality. Even human martial artists of the same level would have a hard time fighting them one-on-one, let alone those of a higher level.</p>
<p>But who are these people present? Those were the most outstanding talents handpicked by the entire empire. They were monsters. Shaw, that&#x27;s all. Long Sha, who had just stepped off the golden chariot, snorted disdainfully since no one dares to take the lead. Then this young master will go first.</p>
<p>An extremely arrogant shout rang out. Zhao Ei, who was covered in thick gold chains and had just been called a piece of trash by Xiao Hongi, threw his cigar on the ground and crushed it with his limited edition crocodile leather shoes. He adjusted his dazzling pure gold armor and swagger to the center of the arena. Goha Shiao, you&#x27;re the most handsome. In the audience, a group of cheerleaders, clearly hired, were screaming at the top of their lungs and waving lightboards with the character Zhao printed on them.</p>
<p>Zoey blew a kiss over there in a flamboyant manner, then pointed to a shadow leopard in the cage, its body completely black and its claws and teeth as sharp as knives. That&#x27;s it. Late stage of the fourth realm. I&#x27;ll use it as a sacrifice today. Su Xiao Yao glanced at the data panel, raised an eyebrow, and said, &quot;Zhao E, early stage of the fourth realm, challenging the late stage of the fourth realm, Shadow Leopard, crossing two minor realms.</p>
<p>Are you sure?&quot; The Shadow Panther is known for its speed and high burst damage, making it a nightmare for fragile warriors. Enough talk. Open the cage. Zhao waved his hand. Click.</p>
<p>The moment the cage door opened, the shadow leopard, its eyes bloodshot, transformed into a black lightning bolt, and lunged straight at Zhao Yis throat. The speed is so fast that it&#x27;s difficult for the naked eye to detect. What? So fast, Zhao? He let out a strange cry, but it was as if his feet were oiled, and he slid backwards several meters in an extremely strange way. At the same time, his pure gold armor suddenly lit up with a dense array of runes. Buzz.</p>
<p>A thick pale gold energy shield instantly expanded. Bang. The shadow panther&#x27;s sharp claws gripped the shield. Sparks flying, but not even a mark was left. He stunned, aren&#x27;t you? This is the Vajra rune armor that the old man bought for me for over 10 billion.</p>
<p>It can withstand a full force attack from a fifth realm expert. Zhao E, beaming with pride, reached to his waist and pulled out an exaggeratedly designed rune pistol, then unleashed a barrage of shots at the shadow leopard. Rat, rat, rat. What was fired were not bullets, but compressed high explosive pellets. Boom! Boom! Boom! Explosions echoed one after another, and billowing smoke and dust filled the air.</p>
<p>The poor shadow leopard was fast, but it couldn&#x27;t withstand the overwhelming barrage of fire. It howled in pain and was charred black. That&#x27;s not all. Watch this young master&#x27;s ultimate move. Zhao E roared and pulled out a handful of golden talismans from his pocket, throwing them out like scattering paper money.</p>
<p>Explode, explode, explode. As he made hand gestures, the talismans transformed into fireballs, ice spikes, and lightning bolts, all crashing down on the shadow leopard. 3 minutes later, that shadow leopard at the late stage of the fourth realm was smashed into a pulp by this pile of priceless items, dying a truly humiliating death. Done. Job done.</p>
<p>Zoey blew on the smoke from the gun barrel and struck what he thought was a cool pose. There was a 2- second silence followed by a burst of booze and laughter. This works. Is this what they call money power? That&#x27;s so unfair. This isn&#x27;t a martial arts contest.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s clearly showing off wealth. To be fair, this gear is really tough. The shadow panther tried to grab it for ages, but couldn&#x27;t break through its defenses. Su Xiao Yao also looked helpless, but the rules didn&#x27;t say that equipment couldn&#x27;t be used, so she could only reluctantly announce. Zhao Ei challenge successful.</p>
<p>Time taken 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Currently ranked first in points. With Zhao Yis example serving as a starting point, the pace of the subsequent match is noticeably quickened. Chapter 160. Xiao Hongi defeats six realms with her spear.</p>
<p>Shinuan&#x27;s fate. The prodigies from each major war zone made their appearances. Lin Wner of the Lynn family in the southern territory at the mid-stage of the fourth realm challenges the ironbacked wolf, a peak fourth realm cultivator. That gentle woman from Jang Nan possessed an extraordinary skill in the green with longevity technique. Countless vines sprouted from the ground, binding the wolf like a dumpling, and she captured it without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Iron Mountain in the Western Territory, the peak of the fourth realm, challenges the earthsplitting mad bear at the early stage of the fifth realm. That bald aesthetic monk went head-to-head with the raging bear, exchanging 300 punches with it and finally smashed the bear&#x27;s head open, drawing cheers from the crowd. Soon, the main event began. The Chin family, Chinwa, the icy girl who had been sitting in the corner, seemingly isolated from the world, stood up. She walked barefoot, step by step, into the center of the field without Su Xiao Yao even needing to ask.</p>
<p>Her icy blue eyes locked onto a lion encased in a speciallymade cage. Its body ablazed with flames. Peak of the fifth realm, fiery demon lion. Chinw&#x27;s voice was cold and aloof, devoid of any warmth or human touch. The entire audience gasped.</p>
<p>She had only broken through to the mid-stage of the fifth realm a few days ago. And now she was about to cross three minor realms to challenge a firet type star beast at the peak of the fifth realm. And it&#x27;s even the fire element, which is its weakness. Roar. The fiery lion burst out of its cage, unleashing a massive fireball capable of melting steel.</p>
<p>Chinua remained expressionless, simply raising her fair, jade-like hand. Frozen, he uttered two words. An extreme chill erupted rapidly from her center. The fireball that was hurtling towards them came to an abrupt halt in midair. Its flames extinguished and covered by a thick layer of frost.</p>
<p>Click. The fireball shattered into dust. The next second, a blizzard descended from the sky, turning the entire arena into a world of ice and snow. The majestic flaming lion hadn&#x27;t even had a chance to pounce on Chin Schweb before its blood was frozen by the terrifying cold and it collapsed stiffly to the ground, turning into a lifelike ice sculpture, sold out instantly. A complete and utter annihilation.</p>
<p>The SSS level ice phoenix talent is terrifying. Many of the bigwigs on the podium changed their expressions. This kind of control, this kind of bloodline suppression is simply unreasonable. Then longing also appeared. carrying that heavy battle sword, exuding a murderous aura.</p>
<p>She also chose a bloodthirsty demonic ape at the peak of the fifth realm. There is no fancy magic, only the purest swordsmanship and power. Cut. Longing activated her dragon soul battle body. Her entire body covered in elucory dragon scales.</p>
<p>With a single slash accompanied by a rolling dragon roar, she directly cleaved the demonic ape known for its defense in two. Blood was everywhere and the violence was extreme. Good. Shinyuan sat in the audience and led the applause. As expected of my instructor Long, his waist strength and explosive power are incredible.</p>
<p>We must extend his time tonight. The other contestants around him were giving him even stranger looks. Dude, that&#x27;s your teammate. Can&#x27;t you focus on something serious? Just then, an even more violent and intense aura swept across the entire area. Xiao Hongi stood up.</p>
<p>She hoisted the black and gold spear onto her shoulder, her red ponytail swaying behind her head like a dancing flame. They went straight to the deepest part, the area where the most terrifying beasts were imprisoned. Early stage of the six realms, ironclad flying dragon. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s tone was calm, but it revealed a wildness that seemed to want to tear a hole in the sky. What? Armored flying dragon.</p>
<p>Su Xiao Yao was so startled she almost dropped the microphone. Xiao Hongi, are you challenging the armored flying dragon? That&#x27;s a king- level creature. They have developed a sense of territory and rudimentary intelligence. Stop talking nonsense and release it. Xiao Hongi pointed her spear, her killing intense soaring to the sky.</p>
<p>Roar Dash, a steel armored dragon with a wingspan of over 20 m soared into the sky, its body covered in black metallic scales, whipping up a whirlwind as it flapped its wings. It sensed the provocation from Xiao Hongi and unleashed a highly corrosive dragon breath. Good timing. Instead of retreating, Xiao Hongi advanced, pushing off the ground with both feet and shot straight into the sky like a red cannonball. Gun soul wildfire.</p>
<p>The black and gold spear in her hand instantly transformed into a roaring fire dragon. A cold glint appeared at the tip of the spear first and then the spear shot out like a dragon. Ding, ding, ding, ding. A series of rapid metallic clanging sounds exploded in the air. Xiao Hongi actually fought the flying dragon headon for dozens of rounds in the air.</p>
<p>Every shot landed precisely in the gaps between the dragon&#x27;s scales. Die with a delicate shout. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s body twisted mysteriously in midair, dodging the dragon&#x27;s tail attack, and she mounted the dragon&#x27;s back. The spear was raised high, carrying earthshattering fiery energy, and plunged fiercely into the dragon&#x27;s neck. Black blood gushed out like a spring.</p>
<p>The sixth level king rank flying dragon let out a mournful cry as its massive body plummeted from the sky, crashing heavily to the ground and kicking up clouds of dust. Xiao Hongi pulled out the spear with one hand, shook off the blood, and stood proudly on the dragon corpse like an invincible Valkyrie. The entire venue erupted in cheers. Goddess of war. Goddess of war.</p>
<p>The cheers nearly lifted the roof off. He crossed a major realm and slew a sixth realm king level star beast. This achievement is worthy of being recorded in the annals of the battle of the prodigies. Immediately afterward, Long Sha was not to be outdone. He also challenged a giant deep sea serpent at the early stage of the sixth realm.</p>
<p>Relying on his eerie purple demonic eyes and doineering Imperial dragon aura, he couldn&#x27;t be as decisive as Xiao Hongi. But he still managed to kill the giant python, demonstrating the terrifying foundation of the crown prince. At this point, all the favorites to win the championship have revealed their hand. On the leaderboard, Xiao Hongi is currently in first place with a slight advantage, followed by Long Sha in second, Chinua in third, and Longing in fourth. All eyes finally focused on the man who was still sitting in the chair feeding grapes to Akasha.</p>
<p>Hey, you jigalo. Xiao Hong Yi stood on the arena, pointing the tip of her spear at Shin Yuan with a face full of disdain. Everyone else is done except you. If you don&#x27;t dare to fight, then hurry up and take your woman home and stop making a fool of yourself here. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Get down. Did he pee his pants from fright? The audience started to jeer. Shinyuan swallowed the grape in his mouth and slowly wiped his mouth. He stood up, stretched out a big yawn, and his joints cracked all over. What&#x27;s the rush? The best is yet to come.</p>
<p>He pushed Akasha aside and staggered onto the ring. As he passed by Longing, he paused and reached out his hand. Instructor Long, may I borrow your knife? Longing was taken aback. You don&#x27;t have a weapon yourself? I was in a rush to leave and forgot to bring it. Shin Yuan said matterof factly.</p>
<p>Longing rolled her eyes speechlessly, but still handed him the 300B alloy battle knife. Be careful. This knife is heavy. Don&#x27;t worry. Don&#x27;t you know how strong my back is? Shin Yuan took the battle sword, casually twirled it, and the 300-lb weight was as light as a fire poker in his hands.</p>
<p>He walked to the center of the field and glanced at the cages where the star beasts were still kept. Finally, his gaze settled on a huge iron cage bound by speciallymade rune chains and locked in the farthest corner. There was a giant ape that was over 5 m tall with muscles that bulged like granite and two fangs. Peak of the fifth realm, Vudra demon ape. This is a powerful star beast known for its strength and defense.</p>
<p>Even peak fifth realm martial artists of the same level are unwilling to confront it head-on. That&#x27;s it. Shinuan raised the tip of his knife and pointed it at the demonic ape. What? Su Xiaoa was shocked again. Shinuan, your current realm is only at the peak of the fourth realm, right? You want to challenge the Vudra demon ape at the peak of the fifth realm? That&#x27;s a huge leap across a whole realm.</p>
<p>And this thing has insane defense. Are you sure? certainty and affirmation. Shiny Yuan grinned, a faint golden light flickering in his dark eyes. They were playing so fancy and flashy, it was boring. A real man should engage in some real visceral combat.</p>
<p>Oh no, I&#x27;ll definitely be back. H chapter 161 unrivaled power sword technique. He&#x27;s insane. This kid is absolutely insane. A peak fourthrem cultivator fighting a peak fifth realm cultivator.</p>
<p>And this is the Vudrad demon ape with the most insane defense. Who does he think he is? Xiao Hongi. Even Xiao Hongi relied on her marksmanship and agility to fight that flying dragon. This kid is trying to fight head-on with a broken knife. The audience erupted in uproar.</p>
<p>No one had a good chance of winning against Shinuan. Even the bigwigs on the podium shook their heads. This time I&#x27;m afraid I misjudged the situation. It&#x27;s good for young people to be energetic, but being too arrogant is foolish. Only Akasha sat in the audience, swirling a glass of red wine in her hand, looking at Shin Yuan on stage with blind worship and infatuation in her eyes.</p>
<p>Dragon Lord tear it apart. Roar dash. As the cage door opened, the Vudger demon ape let out a deafening roar. It had been locked up for so long and was already incredibly thirsty. Upon seeing the small, thin human in front of it, a savage red light flashed in its eyes and it slammed its powerful legs against the ground.</p>
<p>Boom! A huge crater was instantly blown open in the ground. Like a cannonball, the demonic ape charged towards Shin Yuan with a stench. That fist, bigger than Shin Yuan&#x27;s head, slammed down with immense force. That punch is enough to smash a main battle tank into a pancake. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t dodge a contest of strength.</p>
<p>You think you&#x27;re worthy? Boom. Dash. The S-rank undying dragon blood within Shun Yuan&#x27;s body completely boiled at this moment. His heart pounded violently, and the blood he pumped was as hot as magma, washing over every blood vessel and every muscle. Beneath his skin, the golden dragon scale patterns were solidified, vaguely, giving him an invisible golden armor.</p>
<p>Shinuan held the knife in one hand without using any fancy martial arts techniques or mobilizing any elemental energy. It&#x27;s just a simple upward flick. Pure physical strength, pure explosive power. roll. A loud shout like a thunderclap.</p>
<p>Clang dash. The battle blade and the demonic ape&#x27;s iron fist collided fiercely. It wasn&#x27;t the sound of a sharp blade piercing flesh, but rather the deafening clang of metal colliding. Then something happened that made everyone&#x27;s eyes pop out. That powerful 5-tonon plus ape charging with incredible ferocity was actually killed by Shu Yuan&#x27;s single strike.</p>
<p>It flew. That&#x27;s right. It was a lobbed kick just like hitting a baseball. Its massive body traced an arc in the air and flew backward for more than 10 meters. What? The entire audience of 100,000 people simultaneously uttered a curse.</p>
<p>Is this the power that the four realms can possess? This power is even more monstrous than that demonic apes, isn&#x27;t it? Roar. The demonic ape landed, staggered several steps before regaining its balance. And for the first time, its once savage eyes revealed confusion and terror. It looked at its own fist. A deep bone revealing wound appeared on it, and blood gushed out.</p>
<p>Its indestructible body was actually breached. &quot;Is that all you&#x27;ve got?&quot; Shinuan flicked the blood off his knife, twisted his neck, and his eyes, now completely golden vertical pupils, were full of mockery. &quot;Warm up complete! Time to send you on your way!&quot; Before he could finish speaking, Shin Yuan lunged forward. The demonic ape sensed a deadly crisis. It roared madly and crossed its arms to protect its chest.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan&#x27;s figure appeared above the demonic ape&#x27;s head. He gripped the knife with both hands and raised it high. At this moment, he was no longer a human, but an ancient Tyrannosaurus that had taken human form. His muscles were taught to the extreme, and golden dragon energy condensed wildly on the blade, transforming into a golden blade beam 10 m long. &quot;Open it for me!&quot; A single slash.</p>
<p>Only this golden light remained on the arena stage. There were no earthshattering explosions or dazzling special effects. Only the simplest, most brutal, and most shocking. Cut it in two with one stroke. The Vajrad demon ape, whose defense was comparable to an alloy fortress, was cleaved in two from head to crotch before it could even let out a scream.</p>
<p>Blood and internal organs gushed out like a fountain. The two halves of the corpse crashed to the ground, shaking the arena. Shin Yuan, holding a battle sword, stood amidst the corpses. Not a single drop of blood stained the black trench coat. Only the alloy battle sword, unable to withstand this terrifying power, let out a mournful cry and shattered into a pile of scrap metal with a crack.</p>
<p>Dead silence. The entire dragon&#x27;s Nest arena fell into an even more complete and utter silence than before. Everyone gaped, their minds blank. One cut. Just one cut.</p>
<p>He instantly killed a peak level fifth realm demonic ape known for its defense. and he was using an ordinary alloy battle sword without any attribute bonuses, relying purely on physical strength. Is this person even human? Glug, I don&#x27;t know who swallowed first. Immediately afterwards, the entire audience erupted in a deafening roar of gasps. My god, what am I seeing? Is this the four realms? This power and explosive force are comparable even to a sixth realm marshall king.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s brutal. That&#x27;s so cool. That&#x27;s a real man on the player&#x27;s bench. Xiao Hongi stared at Shun Yuan in astonishment, her hand holding the spear, trembling slightly. She just killed a sixth realm flying dragon.</p>
<p>But that was through skill and hit and run tactics. She knew she couldn&#x27;t do what Shun Yuan did. Overwhelm a star beast a whole realm higher than herself with sheer power and kill it with a single strike. Is this guy really a jigalo? Xiao Hongi&#x27;s eyes changed, filled with apprehension and a hint of inexplicable fighting spirit. Longhao&#x27;s face was also ashen.</p>
<p>The imperial dragon energy within him actually showed a hint of instinctive fear in the face of the golden aura that Shin Yuan had just unleashed. That&#x27;s dragons might, a dragon&#x27;s might even purer than mine. Long Sha was shocked. Could he also be a member of the Long family who had been separated from his family? No way. His bloodline level is even higher than mine.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoa was stunned for a long time before she reacted. Her voice trembled as she watched the scores fluctuating wildly on the data board. Challenge successful, leaping over a major realm. It took 25 seconds. Kill rating perfect.</p>
<p>Crushing. Based on the points tally, Shin Yuan has directly climbed to the top. He&#x27;s ranked number one. On the screen, Shin Yuan&#x27;s name shot up to the very top like a rocket, crushing Xiao Hongi and Long Sha underfoot. Shin Yuan threw away the hilt of his sword, clapped his hands, and turned to walk off the stage.</p>
<p>He walked past Longing, who was completely stunned, and shrugged. &quot;Sorry, instructor Long, I used too much force and broke your knife. I&#x27;ll get you something even better later.&quot; Longing stared blankly at him. Her mind filled with the glory of that slash just now. This scoundrel, who usually only acts like a hooligan and takes advantage of others, has actually become this powerful.</p>
<p>Will I still be able to kick this bastard&#x27;s stinky face in the future? Chapter 162, Deep Blue Nightmare. At the same time, outside the atmosphere of Blue Star on a warship of the Seventh Martial Arts Academy, the two male mentors who had just been mocking Shinyuan were also looking completely takenback. How is this possible? The burly man with the thick beard stared wideeyed at the replay on the screen. How can this kid&#x27;s physical strength be so outrageous? It&#x27;s almost on par with a Titan Cub. Moreover, the golden energy within him was not primordial energy, but rather more like some kind of bloodline power.</p>
<p>The tall, thin man adjusted his monle, his brow furrowed. But the data shows he only has F-level talent. How could an F-level talent support such a strong physique? This doesn&#x27;t make sense. What&#x27;s impossible? The beautiful flower loving instructor who had been sitting in the back lazily swirled her wine glass, a strange light gleaming in her eyes. You two are such blockheads.</p>
<p>All you know is how to look at data and talent levels. The universe is vast and full of wonders. Some geniuses may not have their talents in the five elements, nor in swords and spears. Huam&#x27;s eyes were fixed on the man on the screen who was being affectionately held by Akasha. This little guy&#x27;s talent lies within himself.</p>
<p>F- level talent, huh? That&#x27;s just a smoke screen for mediocre people. to be able to temper one&#x27;s physical body to this extent to make all the women around him devoted to him and even to have their strength increase dramatically. Ms. Hua stood up and the graceful curves outlined by her Chong Sam look particularly alluring under the lights. It seems that this barren galaxy, though not lacking in so-called geniuses, but a treasure like his that can make people stronger, is one of a kind.</p>
<p>I, Huaning, am determined to live off this woman. She turned around and gave a command to the two male instructors who were still in a days. Give me a separate list of his information and add S-level security protection. In the upcoming matches, I want to see every detail of his performance, including when he rests at night. Two male mentors.</p>
<p>Back to the dragon&#x27;s nest site. As soon as Shin Yuan stepped off the stage, Akasha pounced on him, her purple eyes sparkling. Dragon Lord, you were so cool. That slash was absolutely awesome. Shinuan laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Is that cool? It&#x27;s just basic stuff. He sat back down in his chair, took the water lung you offered, and drank it all in one gulp. His gaze swept past the crowd and landed on Long Shiao and Xiao Hongi, whose expressions had changed. He raised his middle finger who just called me trash. Why don&#x27;t you come out and walk around for a bit? If you&#x27;re not satisfied, let&#x27;s practice again in the next round.</p>
<p>mad. Still that familiar madness, but this time no one thought he was showing off because he just proved it in the most brutal way. Shinyuan has the right to be arrogant. The first round of the Battle of the Prodigies came to a close in this dramatic and thrilling atmosphere. Cough, cough.</p>
<p>In midair, Su Xiao flapped her pink light wings and regained the spotlight. A wicked smile, however, lingered on her cute childlike face. Dear brothers and sisters, the first level beast fighting is just an appetizer. It&#x27;s for the reckless. As Su Xiao Yao spoke, she glanced at Shinuan intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>A true strong man not only needs fists that can crush everything, but also an indestructible heart. Now, let&#x27;s move on to our second challenge. Deep Blue Nightmare Buzz. With a low mechanical hum, the ground in the center of the arena cracked open once more. This time instead of cages, 100 streamlined silver white devices resembling space capsules rose up.</p>
<p>Their neat rows exuding a cold futuristic feel. Each cabin is connected to a dense array of data cables. All converging on the giant mechanical eyeball suspended in the air. Tion.1. This is a neural connection virtual system provided by the seventh martial arts academy of the Galaxy Alliance.</p>
<p>Su Xiao Yao excitedly introduced. The rules are simple. Once everyone enters the cabin, the system will directly read the deepest fluctuations in your cerebral cortex and generate a customized nightmare just for you based on your personality weaknesses, fears, and desires. In this dream, you will encounter the monster you fear most, the past you least want to face, or the temptation you find hardest to resist. She held up three fingers, her expression turning serious.</p>
<p>The longer you persist, the higher your score. However, if you suffer a mental breakdown or your heart rate exceeds a critical value within 3 minutes, you will be forcibly ejected. Then we&#x27;ll eliminate you directly. Don&#x27;t blame me for not warning you. Mental trauma is much harder to heal than broken limbs.</p>
<p>We won&#x27;t be responsible if you end up with a mentally impaired mind. Before he could finish speaking, the entire room erupted in uproar. A spiritual trial. This is the most feared level for martial artists. Physical injuries can be healed with medicine.</p>
<p>But once the spirit collapses, the path of martial arts is severed. That&#x27;s interesting. Xiao Hongi planted her spear in the ground and was the first to walk towards one of the devices. As she passed Shin Yuan, she sneered. No matter how strong your brute force is, if your heart is weak, you&#x27;re nothing but a muscle bound good for nothing.</p>
<p>I hope you don&#x27;t wet your pants in your dreams. Shinyuan raised an eyebrow and whistled at her. Don&#x27;t worry, beautiful lady in red. If you appear in my dreams, I definitely won&#x27;t wet my pants. I&#x27;ll only you.</p>
<p>Xiao Hani was furious. She glared at him fiercely and crawled into the cabin. Soon, all the contestants entered the cabin one after another. Shin Yuan reassured Akasha, who wanted to follow him in. Okay, wait here.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be right back. It&#x27;ll only take me a nap. The dragon lord watched with concern in Akasha&#x27;s purple eyes. Shinyuan waved his hand and casually laid down in his deep blue nightmare. The hatch slowly closed, plunging everything into darkness.</p>
<p>Outside, above the dragon&#x27;s nest arena, the giant holographic projection screen was divided into 100 small screens, broadcasting each contestant&#x27;s experience in the illusion in real time. Viewers cannot see the specific details, but the system will visualize the contestants brainwave reactions as scenes and project them onto a large screen. &quot;Look, that&#x27;s Chinua,&quot; someone exclaimed in surprise. In Chin Schwe&#x27;s video, there was a desolate, eternally frozen land. A blizzard raged, leaving her all alone in the world, silent, cold, and utterly desolate.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s absolute loneliness that can drive a person crazy. But Chin Schwe sat cross-legged on the icy plane. Her expression indifferent as ice, not even raising an eyebrow. Is this the heart of the ice phoenix? Embrace solitude. Dominate solitude.</p>
<p>On the other side, Xiao Hongi&#x27;s illusion was a battlefield of carnage, a veritable hell on earth. Countless hideous demons crawled out from underground, trying to drag her into the abyss. In the illusion, Xiao Hongi transforms into a killing god, wielding a long spear that causes chaos and darkness. Her murderous aura is chilling even through the screen. These were all expected until what? Look at Zoe.</p>
<p>someone shouted and everyone&#x27;s attention turned to Zhao Yi&#x27;s split screen. In the video, Zhao Ei is kneeling on the ground, weeping bitterly, holding a piece of steak in his hand. Su Xia Yao curiously switched the radio channel, and Zho Yis heart-wrenching screams instantly echoed throughout the venue. No, this is not the life I want. Why? Why did you do this to me? Where&#x27;s my private jet? Where&#x27;s my yacht? Why are they all gone? Why is dinner just this ordinary piece of Australian Wagyu beef? Where&#x27;s my top grade Kobe beef? This house is only 500 square meters.</p>
<p>How can anyone live in such a small place? Am I an idiot? W is there only one made left in my house? Where did my entire 24 solar terms made core go? I don&#x27;t want to live this poor life anymore. Just kill me. Quiet. A deathly silence. Immediately afterwards, veins popped out on the foreheads of all 100,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Damn it. Can I just go in and kill him? A 500 square meter space is considered a pigsty. Australian Wagyu beef is considered a sign of poverty. I only dare to afford hot pot during Chinese New Year. Is this the hell in the hearts of rich kids? If this is hell, please let me never be reincarnated.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoas lips twitched and she almost couldn&#x27;t resist throwing the microphone at them. This guy isn&#x27;t here to compete. He&#x27;s here for Versailles. Uggh. Uggh.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so hard to get out. I&#x27;ve been nitpicked. Chapter 163. A screen full of mosaics. Is this what you call a test? Sizzle.</p>
<p>Just as the audience was still grumbling and cursing Zhao Yi&#x27;s Versailike nightmare of a 500 square meter pigsty, the split screen image belonging to Shun Yuan located in the center of the big screen suddenly shook violently. Then all the images disappeared. The transition is a full screen heavy and constantly moving mosaic. Moreover, the audio signal that should have been transmitted synchronously was also lost. It was also covered by a piercing beep.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the highest level of blocking mechanism automatically triggered by the system to prevent inappropriate content for children from being leaked. The entire Dragon&#x27;s Nest Arena with its 100,000 spectators held its breath for a moment. The next second, the screams almost lifted the dome off. What? A mosaic? What kind of inappropriate language is this? The system just blocked it. I knew it.</p>
<p>I knew this kid was up to no good. For others, that&#x27;s a nightmare. But for him, it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s actually inside one. Wow. To pull this off in a top tier event broadcast live across the entire Federation, that mental fortitude is unparalleled.</p>
<p>The live stream chat crashed instantly, and the server almost exploded. The screen was filled with people asking to borrow a phone to talk. Su Xiao fluttered her pink wings and hovered in midair. Her face flushed red, and she could barely hold the microphone in her hand. She has presided over two sessions of the battle of the prodigies and has seen people terrified, crying for their parents, and even going berserk and biting others.</p>
<p>But she had never seen anything like this before, where the system forcibly censored the images in her mind less than 10 seconds after she entered. Ahem director, cut the camera. Cut the camera now. Su Xiao frantically gave instructions. Don&#x27;t let this rotten apple spoil the serious atmosphere of our competition.</p>
<p>No matter how noisy the outside world was, Shin Yuan, lying in the silver white space capsule, looked completely bored. As the darkness dissipated, what appeared before him was neither a hideous demon nor a mountain of knives and a sea of fire. Instead, it was an absurdly large pink round bed. A sweet fragrance filled the air, and pink gauze curtains fluttered in the wind. Some have cat ears, some have succubus wings on their backs, and some are simply the legendary fem fatal.</p>
<p>Come here, handsome, my lord. I&#x27;ve been waiting for you for so long. The allure of beautiful women is enough to make any hot-blooded man instantly fall for them. His heart rate skyrocket and then be kicked out of the game by the system for being mentally unstable. Shinuan simply leaned lazily against the headboard and even yawned.</p>
<p>He extended a finger and disdainfully pushed away a succubus&#x27;s face that was leaning close to his. I said, &quot;Does this system have some misunderstanding about the word temptation?&quot; Shin Yuan curled his lip, his gaze sweeping critically over the succubus&#x27;s face. Negative review. In this skin, the blurring is way too heavy. It has no texture at all.</p>
<p>He then pointed to the cattier girl next to him. It&#x27;s one thing if the tail is fake, but can you at least put some effort into your movements? It looks like you&#x27;ve been electrocuted. Are you in the late stages of Parkinson&#x27;s? And you, Shinyuan pointed at the fem fatal. Didn&#x27;t you brush your teeth this morning? The illusions around them which had been working hard all froze for a moment. This script is wrong.</p>
<p>When a normal man comes in, shouldn&#x27;t his eyes light up or he struggle with a flushed face? Why is this man acting like an old lady picking out cabbages at the market? All picky and selective. Shinyuan sighed and laid down in a board position. It&#x27;s boring. So boring. Do you think such vulgar women can corrupt my daist heart? Are you kidding me? If someone is used to a Manchu Han imperial feast, do you expect them to drool over a pre-made dish? Isn&#x27;t this an insult? Could you please change the channel? Shin Yuan shouted into the void.</p>
<p>How about something more challenging, like, let me take on a 1008th Realm experts one-on-one, or let me save world peace or something. This kind of vulgar seduction is torture for someone like me who has transcended low tastes. Outside world, time passed second by second. As the pixelated image remained firmly in the center of the screen, the audience who had been cheering gradually changed their expressions. What began as a joke turned into doubt and finally into deep shock.</p>
<p>2 minutes have passed. Someone glanced at the time and swallowed hard. How did this kid last 2 minutes in that high-intensity scene and look at his vital signs monitoring data? The person next to me pointed to the smooth, almost straight green wavy line at the bottom of the screen, their voice trembling. Heart rate 60, blood pressure normal, dopamine secretion even lower than normal. How is that possible? Was he watching the evening news in there? Su Shaya was also stunned.</p>
<p>She originally thought Shin Yuan was a leerous lunatic who wouldn&#x27;t last more than 30 seconds before being kicked out. But now the surrounding beams of light went out one after another. I&#x27;m not gay. Get lost. A burly man screamed as he was ejected, trembling with fear.</p>
<p>Snakes. So many snakes. Help. One of the female contestants was so frightened that she turned pale and fainted. I want a hair transplant, too.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to be bald. Various bizarre screams rose and fell. In less than 3 minutes, half of the 100 contestants had been eliminated. Even the arrogant Zhao, he couldn&#x27;t hold on for more than 4 minutes. Unable to bear the fear of having no money, he was thrown out crying and screaming, collapsing to the ground, muttering, &quot;Give me back my gold card.&quot; Shinyuans pixelated screen remained lit.</p>
<p>steady as a rock. This composure on the contestant&#x27;s bench, Zhao E, who had already been eliminated, wiped his nose and looked at the image of his older brother on the screen, his eyes bursting with unprecedented admiration. As expected of my elder brother, he can remain calm and unperturbed in the face of temptation of this level. This is a true saint. Sitting next to her, Akasha gently swirled the red wine in her glass, looking at the mosaic on the screen, a proud yet charming smile playing on her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;A bunch of idiots,&quot; she murmured softly, her voice carrying a sense of superiority that only she understood. &quot;The Dragon Lord&#x27;s appetite had long been spoiled. Those counterfeit goods aren&#x27;t even worthy of carrying the Dragon Lord&#x27;s shoes, so how could they possibly move his heart?&quot; Chapter 164. The Gaze from Beyond the Stars. Another easy win.</p>
<p>Within the illusion, Shin Yuan was utterly bored. The illusions of beautiful women seemed to sense the man&#x27;s heartlessness, gradually thinning and finally dissipating into pink smoke. The surroundings were plunged back into a void of darkness. That&#x27;s it. Shinyuan sat up and patted off non-existent dust.</p>
<p>Is this the difficulty of the second level? It&#x27;s way too easy. He looked around and saw that the darkness was not pure black but rather contained countless flowing data streams like the underlying code of some kind of program. Since this thing claims to be able to read memories deep in the brain, a bold idea suddenly popped into Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. From the moment he transmigrated until now, he has known nothing about this body or his mysterious past. Moreover, Shin Yuan felt that this body was the same as his original one, but the world he was in was different.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Shinuan wouldn&#x27;t even realize he had a history of time travel. Old Sheen said he couldn&#x27;t find it. The file was top secret. Does that mean that his original memories actually contained some truths that even he himself was unaware of? Since we&#x27;re already here, why not give it a try? Shin Yuan closed his eyes, no longer resisting the mental connection of this system, and instead took the initiative to relax his mental defenses. He concentrated all his energy, frantically recalling and sketching two vague concepts in his mind.</p>
<p>Father, mother, where exactly is my origin? Buzz. In the instant that thought arose, the once peaceful dark space suddenly began to shake violently. The flowing data streams seemed to be subjected to some terrifying suction force, starting to spin and twist wildly, eventually converging into a huge vortex. Outside at the Dragon&#x27;s Nest Arena, beep beep beep beep. The piercing alarm blared out without warning.</p>
<p>The giant sky, I number one, which was suspended in the air, suddenly began to tremble violently, and fine cracks appeared on its originally silver white mechanical shell. What&#x27;s going on? The system is overloaded. Su Xiao Yao was so frightened that her wings froze, and she looked up in terror. Suddenly, Shinyu on screen, which had been full of pixelated images, went black. It&#x27;s not black because the signal is interrupted.</p>
<p>It is a profound all-encompassing blackness seemingly capable of swallowing all light. Dark, an endless expanse of darkness. But this darkness is not empty. On the contrary, it is filled with a suffocating sense of oppression and an ancient and weathered atmosphere. Shun Yuan felt as if his consciousness had detached from his body, traversing endless space and time from a perspective that exceeded the speed of light.</p>
<p>He saw the blue star transform into a tiny blue marble and disappear rapidly into the distance. He saw the solar system and the Milky Way galaxy rushing past his feet like quicksand. Countless dazzling nebula, raging black holes, and desolate galactic debris flashed wildly before his eyes like a series of fast-forwarded slideshows. Final. The scene freezes on a completely unfamiliar starfield.</p>
<p>There is no starlight here, only endless void storms raging. And at the very heart of that storm stood a colossal bronze gate that defied description. That door is too big. It is so large that it seems to be able to fit into the entire solar system. The door was carved with countless ancient and intricate totems, including roaring dragons, phoenixes rising from the ashes, and countless other gods, demons, and strange beasts that Shin Yuan had never seen before.</p>
<p>They seemed to come alive on the door, silently roaring at the void. Where am I? Shinyuan&#x27;s consciousness was so insignificant before this giant gate that it was not even worth a speck of dust. Just as he was overwhelmed with shock, the colossal bronze gate, which had been tightly closed for countless billions of years, suddenly moved. Rumble. No real sound came, but the tremor that came from the depths of his soul made Shun Yuan feel that his consciousness was about to collapse at any moment.</p>
<p>The giant gate slowly cracked open. It was just a crack. An indescribable aura of terror surged out from behind the door, traversing endless space and time and descended directly upon the blue star at this very moment. Outside the atmosphere of Earth at an altitude of 30,000 mi, the silver gay warship representing the seventh martial arts academy of the Star River Alliance was shaking violently like a leaf falling in a gale. Inside the bridge command center, alarms blared incessantly and red lights flashed wildly.</p>
<p>The energy shield has shattered. The energy shield has shattered. An unknown highdimensional energy reaction has been detected. The values are off the charts. It cannot be calculated.</p>
<p>The burly instructor with a full beard had collapsed to the ground. His face ashen, his body trembling uncontrollably. What? What is this aura? 10th realm? No, this definitely surpasses the 10th realm. The tall, thin man with the monle was bleeding from all seven orififices. His glasses shattered.</p>
<p>He clutched his chest, the fear of his heart about to burst, rendering him speechless. Juan Noming remained seated in the conductor&#x27;s chair, her posture languid. The wine glass in her hand had already fallen, and the scarlet wine was spilled all over her expensive Chong Sam. She gripped the handrail tightly, her fingernails snapping, and her beautiful eyes, which always held a hint of allure and arrogance, were now filled with fear and awe. She came from the depths of the universe, had seen countless powerful beings, and even had the honor of meeting the empress who ruled over the galaxies.</p>
<p>Ancient taboss cannot be looked at directly. Huan Noming squeezed out these words through gritted teeth, and then disregarding her image, slid off the chair, knelt down, and bowed deeply to the blue star below, or rather to the source of that aura. It&#x27;s an instinct. the instinct of submission ingrained in the genes of a lower life form when facing a supreme ruler. At the same time, East China Sea, Yuling Long, who was in seclusion to consolidate her cultivation, suddenly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>A raging crimson gold flame ignited in those originally in different Phoenix eyes, only to be instantly extinguished by an overwhelming sense of horror. Puff! She opened her mouth and spat out a stream of golden blood essence, her aura waning. this aura. Yuling Long didn&#x27;t bother wiping the blood from the corner of her mouth. She suddenly stood up, her gaze seemingly piercing through thousands of kilometers, looking towards the direction of the capital.</p>
<p>Her body was trembling. The void flame phoenix bloodline within his body, a divinely bestowed SSS level bloodline was now like a fledgling bird encountering its natural enemy, cowering deep within his dantion, trembling and not daring to let out even a spark. Who is it? Who on earth has triggered this forbidden existence? The capital city, Dragon&#x27;s Nest Arena. The 100,000 audience members present did not feel the highdimensional pressure targeting their souls. All they saw was the sky suddenly turning black, as if the end of the world had arrived.</p>
<p>The elucory image of Old Chen, suspended in midair, made a move that everyone would never forget. Old Chen, the demagog of the ninth realm, facing a certain direction in the void. Slowly, solemnly, deeply, he bent down. He performed a grand gesture that is only performed when a junior meets a senior. Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Old Sheen&#x27;s voice trembled, carrying an excitement and vicissitude that transcended the years. But he hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. Buzz. In the center of the arena, the hundred deep blue nightmare devices finally succumbed to the terrifying surge of energy. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! A series of explosions rang out.</p>
<p>Those prodigies still struggling in the illusion. Whether it&#x27;s Chin Shua honing her will on the icy plains. Xiao Hongi caught up in the carnage amidst mountains of corpses and seas of blood or Long Shiao battling against the imperial dragon energy. All of them are thriving. At that moment, their illusion shattered.</p>
<p>It was those cold, indifferent eyes projected from behind the massive bronze gate. I was only glanced at by that gaze. Huff dash. Chin Schwe&#x27;s body trembled violently and she spat out a mouthful of blood onto the cabin wall, nearly fainting. The phantom of the spear in Xiao Hongs hand shattered and she let out a scream before being forcibly ejected from the cabin.</p>
<p>Long Sha was in an even more miserable state. The vertical line of the purple demon eye between his eyebrows actually cracked open and two lines of bloody tears flowed down. His whole body seemed to have had his spine removed and he slid down limply. In just one second, apart from the cabin where Shun Yuan was located, the remaining 20 contestants were all eliminated. All of them were deemed mentally broken and forcibly eliminated by the system because their minds could not withstand the immense pressure of that terrifying force.</p>
<p>This is too difficult. It&#x27;s so nitpicky. Chapter 165. Everyone else is unconscious, but I&#x27;m the only one awake. That&#x27;s quite a show.</p>
<p>Click with a sickeningly loud screech of air pressure release. The canopy of the silver white deep blue nightmare numbered 001 located in the very center of the arena finally popped open a crack. A slender hand rested on the edge and then Shun Yuan&#x27;s refreshed face peeked out. He stretched out a big yawn, his joints cracking like popping beans and even yawned contentedly, rubbing his sleepy eyes. Oh, what a good night&#x27;s sleep.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt as if he had soaked in a top-notch hot spring with every pore of his body radiating energy. I was lost in thought in that darkness just now and I didn&#x27;t figure anything out, but I was surprisingly energetic. Hey Sue, is your time up yet? I think I passed. As Shin Yuan spoke, he used one hand to brace himself against the edge of the cabin and nimly jumped out. The expected cheers did not materialize.</p>
<p>The surroundings were eerily quiet. Shin Yuan was stunned for a moment and subconsciously looked around. He was completely stunned when he saw it. In the center of the vast arena, the hundred high-tech virtual reality pods were emitting wisps of black smoke, and some were even hissing and sputtering sparks as if they had all shortcircuited. And those once arrogant and invincible geniuses.</p>
<p>What? Shinyuans eyes widened. In the cabin closest to him, Xiao Hongi, the female gunslinger from the north, was slumped in her seat. Her red armor was dull and lifeless, and she looked as if she had just been pulled out of the water, drenched in sweat. Her eyes rolled back and her mouth was even twitching unconsciously. Look further into the distance.</p>
<p>The ice queen Sheen Shu clutched her chest, a streak of blood at the corner of her mouth, her face as pale as paper, her always icy eyes unfocused as if she had lost her soul. Long Sha, the heir of the Long family, fared even worse. He slid directly from the cabin to the ground, lying sprawled out. The purple vertical line between his eyebrows, which he was so proud of, had split open and his face was covered in blood, making it look like a crime scene. As for Zhao E, that show off who was obsessed with flaunting his wealth, he was currently cowering in a corner, trembling and muttering incoherently, &quot;Don&#x27;t eat me.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t eat me.&quot; Of the 100 contestants, all but Shinuan were eliminated. Even the giant mechanical eyeball Tanya number one, which was responsible for the live broadcast in midair, was hanging crookedly, its lens cracked into a spiderweb, and occasionally flashing a malfunctioning red light. What&#x27;s going on here? Shinyuan scratched his head, looking completely bewildered. He glanced at Su Xiao, who was hovering in midair, no longer flapping her wings and staring at him with the look of someone looking at a prehistoric behemoth, and chuckled dryly. Did I break the machine? Shinyuan felt a little uneasy just now inside.</p>
<p>He seemed to be thinking about philosophical questions like, &quot;Who am I? Where am I? And who are my parents?&quot; And then his mind went blank and the machine went black. Could it be that my brain waves were too strong and burned out this broken system? Thinking of this, Shinuan immediately put on a pained and extremely humble expression, waving his hands repeatedly at Su Xiao Yao. Host Su, this is my fault. It&#x27;s my fault for mishandling it. He pointed to the half-dead geniuses on the ground and said with righteous indignation, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll admit defeat on this level.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want the points. Give them all to them. Fill their accounts to the maximum. I, Shin Yuan, am utterly unworthy to be compared to these pillars of the empire. I was merely a figurehead.</p>
<p>What happened just now was purely accidental, a machine malfunction, and doesn&#x27;t count.&quot; Shin Yuan&#x27;s words were a heartfelt attempt to shift the blame. But when these words reached the ears of the others present as well as the millions of viewers in the live stream who hadn&#x27;t completely lost connection, the meaning instantly changed. It&#x27;s gone bad. It&#x27;s become extremely versailike, extremely arrogant. The entire room fell silent for 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Then a commotion erupted that was more intense than ever before. Listen to this. Listen to this. Is this even human language? He shattered the mental worlds of a 100 prodigies, destroyed the system, and then claimed he was just there to make up the numbers. And he even offered to give his points to others.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t humility. It&#x27;s blatant humiliation. This is absolutely devastating. Look at Xiao Hongi&#x27;s trembling hands. She&#x27;s probably been woken up by anger.</p>
<p>That was terrifying. What was that oppressive force just now? I felt my heart stop even through the screen. What kind of monster is hiding inside Shinyuan? Su Xiaoa finally came to her senses. She looked at Shan Yuan who had an innocent expression and her lips twitched uncontrollably. Lose.</p>
<p>Even if you wanted to lose now, no one would dare to beat you. That terrifying aura that even that person had to bow to just now came from your cabin. Although no one knows exactly what happened, even a fool could see that the reason these geniuses ended up in such a miserable state was because they couldn&#x27;t withstand the aftershocks emanating from Shinuan. Cough. Cough.</p>
<p>Su Xiaoa forced herself to calm down, glanced at the data panel in her hand which had already exceeded its limit and announced in a dry voice. Second level deep blue nightmare. The system crashed due to force majour. But before the system crashed, Shinuan was the only contestant who remained conscious and had stable vital signs. So Su Xiaoa took a deep breath and shouted, &quot;First place in this round, Shinuan.</p>
<p>His score is off the charts. He advances directly. As for others, she glanced at the wounded scattered on the ground, sighed helplessly, and said, &quot;Everyone is on standby, awaiting assessment by the medical team.&quot; &quot;Shinuan, no. I already said I conceded defeat, so why are you still forcing me to be number one? That&#x27;s great. The hatred level is maxed out.&quot; He sighed helplessly and could only reluctantly accept the outcome.</p>
<p>He casually shrugged at Akasha in the audience, giving her an arrogant look that said, &quot;I can&#x27;t help it. My strength doesn&#x27;t allow me to keep a low profile. Chapter 166. The match is suspended. The reactions of the two beautiful women.</p>
<p>At the same time, outside the atmosphere of Earth on that silver gray warship that nearly disintegrated. The command center was a mess, and the alarm was still blaring mournfully. Juan Nonging got up from the ground, her delicate hair disheveled, and her highlit Chong Sam was covered in dust, making her look somewhat disheveled, but her beautiful eyes were frighteningly bright. Glug the burly bearded instructor next to him swallowed hard, gripping the still smoking control panel, his voice trembling. Instructor Hua, was that really done by that frank kid? F-class.</p>
<p>Huan Nonging scoffed, ignoring the red wine stains on the ground, and walked barefoot across to the large screen. She stretched out her finger and gently traced it across the screen onto that handsome, innocent looking face, her eyes burning with the intensity that seemed to melt Shin Yuan. Have you ever seen an F-rank that could attract the attention of the bronze gate? Have you ever seen an F-class ship that could almost shatter our star destroying warship with just a thought? The tall, thin instructor pushed up his shattered monle, his face filled with terror. The Bronze Gate is a legendary taboo that even the 12th Realm domain lords dare not easily mention. Could this kid be the reincarnation of some ancient powerful being? Or shut up.</p>
<p>Huan Nomian coldly interrupted him, her voice carrying an unquestionable authority. Everything that just happened is classified as top secret. Anyone who dares to divulge a single word will be skinned alive without the empress even lifting a finger. She turned around and looked at the man on the screen who was being watched by a group of people. She licked her red lips and the greed and possessiveness in her eyes could no longer be concealed.</p>
<p>I originally thought it was just a strong little puppy, but it turned out to be an ancient dragon that hadn&#x27;t grown up yet. This isn&#x27;t just about living off a woman. This is clearly a walking opportunity to become a god. We must take it at all costs. Juaning took a deep breath, her chest heaving violently.</p>
<p>Prepare the landing craft. I&#x27;m going to the dragon&#x27;s nest myself. But the game wasn&#x27;t over yet. What&#x27;s the point of even comparing? Huan noonging kicked aside the chair blocking her way, exuding doineering aura. I&#x27;m going to make a home visit.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to give this student Shin Yuan some proper after school tutoring. Meanwhile, in the far away Commonwealth at the Rothschild family&#x27;s extravagantly luxurious Sky Estate, a middle-aged woman dressed elegantly and well-maintained was sitting in front of a huge floor toseeiling window holding a glass of scarlet margarita. She is Katarina. Akasha&#x27;s aunt is also the current acting head of the Rothschild family. At this moment, the holographic projection in front of her was playing footage of the dragon&#x27;s nest arena.</p>
<p>Haha, what a disgraceful thing. Katarina looked at Akasha, who was nestled beside Shin Yuan like a maid, and the contempt in her eyes was almost overflowing. The heir to the prestigious Rothschild family, in order to survive, actually became a slave to a man from Lia, and even called him master in front of the whole world. Akasha. Akasha, where has your former arrogance gone? Did it get eaten by a dog? She swirled her wine glass, a cruel smile playing on her lips.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s fine. The more despicable you are, the more disappointed those old fogies in the family will be in you. Once you&#x27;ve completely lost your usefulness, I can. However, she hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. The screen suddenly started shaking violently, followed by a black screen and chaos that lasted for several minutes.</p>
<p>When the signal was restored, he saw the image of himself standing alone in the center of the field, completely unharmed, while all the top geniuses around him were seriously injured and lying on the ground. Snap! The crystal wine glass in Katarina&#x27;s hand was crushed to pieces by her. The shards of glass pierced her well-maintained palm, and blood mixed with the wine dripped down, but she was completely unaware. How is this possible? She suddenly stood up staring at the lazyl looking man on the screen, her pupils contracting sharply. The terrifying shock wave that just emanated from the screen even made her who was halfway around the world feel a chill run down her spine.</p>
<p>That man was more than just a lucky stud. Did he subdue the entire audience in an instant? Katarina&#x27;s breathing became rapid. She is a shrewd politician and even more so a profit-driven businesswoman. She keenly sensed something unusual. What if Akasha wasn&#x27;t forced to live in humiliation, but instead latched onto a powerful patron capable of turning the world upside down? Was Akasha&#x27;s breakthrough to the sixth realm due to him? All the top talents in the arena were seriously injured, but he was the only one who was unharmed.</p>
<p>Katarina&#x27;s expression shifted wildly, her eyes darting between fear and greed. A long time. She took a few deep breaths, picked up the encrypted communicator on the table, and dialed a number. Relay my order. halt all assassination plans targeting Akasha.</p>
<p>They also immediately sent someone to Lia with the family&#x27;s precious life essence and the transfer document regarding the mining rights on the west coast. The person on the other end of the phone was clearly taken aback. Madam, you mean idiot? Katarina cursed, her eyes fixed on the man on the screen whose arm Akasha was holding, her voice trembling slightly. Prepare a generous gift. I want to go to Lia myself.</p>
<p>if that man truly possessed such extraordinary abilities. She touched the fine lines at the corners of her eyes, a hint of madness flashing in her eyes. Perhaps the future of the Rothschild family is truly about to change. And I heard he likes mature women. Katarina looked at her still attractive face in the mirror, a meaningful smile curving her lips.</p>
<p>For the sake of her family, or rather for her own sake, making a sacrifice is not out of the question. Inside the dragon&#x27;s nest arena, chaos reigned. Quick, medical team, over here. The dragon prince is vomiting blood. Miss Chin Schwe&#x27;s heart rate is dropping.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s the stretcher? Where did the stretcher go? Xiao Hongi needs immediate psychological counseling. Quickly, bring her some sedatives. A group of medical personnel and white coats rushed into the scene like firefighters, hurriedly lifting those usually high and mighty elites onto stretchers. The scene was extremely chaotic, almost like a major car crash. Su Xiao Yao fluttered her wings and hovered in midair, barely able to hold the microphone in her hand.</p>
<p>She looked at the mess, then at the culprit, who was strolling around the field with his hands behind his back as if nothing had happened, and was utterly speechless. This battle of the proud has been held for so many sessions, and it&#x27;s common for opponents to be injured or crippled. But someone like Shin Yuan, without shedding a drop of blood or even lifting a finger, managed to send everyone to the ICU. absolutely unprecedented and unparalleled. What&#x27;s the point of even comparing these things? Dear viewers, Su Xiao forced herself to put on a smile that looked more like a grimace for the camera.</p>
<p>Due to a minor technical mishap that just occurred, most of the players are feeling unwell. After an emergency consultation between the organizing committee and Mr. machine in order to protect the lives of all the outstanding participants and to repair the damaged equipment. I hereby announce that this year&#x27;s heavenly pride tournament will be suspended for 3 days. 3 days from now, we will have our final battle.</p>
<p>These words caused an uproar in the audience. But seeing the horrific state of those being carried away, no one had anything to say. If this competition continues, these future flowers of the empire will probably all perish here. Chapter 167. Inspecting the wounded.</p>
<p>taking Xiao Hongs pulse inside the dragon&#x27;s nest arena. It was as chaotic as if it had just been plowed up by a horde of star beasts. The alarms of the medical robots, the screeching of stretcher wheels, and the suppressed groans of the wounded mingled together. Su Xiao Yao was still flapping her wings in the air, trying to maintain order, her voice from shouting. Shinuan, however, acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>With his hands behind his back, he swaggered off the stage with an air of nonchulence. Instead of leaving, he strolled over to the rows of stretchers with a look of grief and concern, like a leader who had just come down from a victorious battle to inspect the work. Oh my, isn&#x27;t this our young master? Shinyuan stopped in front of a stretcher, looked at E, who was still trembling and muttering, &quot;My money!&quot; clicked his tongue twice, bent down, and patted Zho Yi&#x27;s face, which was covered with snot and tears. &quot;Wake up! Stop howling! Your gold card is still there. No one&#x27;s going to steal it from you.&quot; Zhoi suddenly opened his eyes, saw it was Shun Yuan, and burst into tears, grabbing Shun Yuans leg tightly.</p>
<p>Big Brother, dear Big Brother, I was so scared just now. I dreamt that I went bankrupt, had to sleep under a bridge, and even had to fight with dogs for steamed buns. Promising. Shinuan pulled his leg out with disgust, and quickly wiped it off. So many media outlets are watching.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t embarrass Dong Hai. After dismissing his cheap underling, Shin Yuan hummed a little tune, then turned his gaze and locked onto a red figure not far away, surrounded by a group of medical staff. Xiao Hongi, the northern gunslinger, was lying on a stretcher, her everpresent black and gold spear lying to the side. Her dark red alloy armor was somewhat worn, tightly wrapping around her explosively powerful body. Because of the severe mental trauma she had just suffered.</p>
<p>She was in a semic-conscious and exhausted state. Her chest heaving violently with her rapid breathing. The chest armor of that battles suit was designed to be extremely form-fitting and magnificent. With every rise and fall, one could worry that the special alloy might just break apart. Shin Yuans eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>He stroked his chin, leaned closer, and waved away the several female doctors standing nearby. Go away. What are you busy with? This is an internal injury, a psychological one. Your painkillers are useless. Let me handle it.</p>
<p>When the doctors saw that the person in question was the monster who had stunned everyone, they didn&#x27;t dare to utter a sound and quickly made way for him. Shiny Yuan didn&#x27;t stand on ceremony. He simply moved a small stool over and sat down beside the stretcher with an air of nonchulence. He stared at Xiao Hongi without any restraint. I have to say, this woman has a really amazing figure.</p>
<p>His muscles, honed through years of battles, are firm, smooth, and without an ounce of excess fat. Even when lying flat, those long legs appeared slender and powerful with slightly raised muscles in the thighs, exuding a wild beauty. Especially his face, so heroic and imposing. Even though it was as pale as paper, his brows were still tightly furrowed, revealing a stubbornness that refused to admit defeat. &quot;Wow, that figure.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a shame she&#x27;s not a pedic driver.&quot; Cough, cough. I mean, it&#x27;s a shame she&#x27;s not a model. Shin Yuan muttered to himself, then stretched out a hand and placed it naturally on Xiao Hongs wrist, which was covered by a wrist guard. Come, let this divine doctor take your pulse. The moment his fingertips touched her skin, Shinuan could feel Xiao Hongs body stiffened slightly.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi, who had kept her eyes tightly closed, trembled her eyelashes and suddenly opened her eyes. Those sharp hawk-like eyes were bloodshot and filled with confusion. But when they saw Shun Yuan&#x27;s face, which was so close to theirs, and had that smug smile on it, their confusion instantly turned into a raging fire. What are you doing? Don&#x27;t move around. Shin Yuan looked serious, even frowning, and pretended to close his eyes.</p>
<p>Your pulse is irregular. Your internal heat is excessive, and your heart rate is aythmic. Redclad beauty, your endocrine imbalance is quite serious. Let go. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s chest heaved even more violently with anger, and her armor groaned under the strain.</p>
<p>Who gave you permission to touch me? Get away. I&#x27;m doing this for your own good. Shin Yuan opened his eyes, his gaze inadvertently sweeping over her chest, and said earnestly, look at you with such a fiery temper. You must have been shouting and yelling in the illusion just now, right? That must be exhausting. As he spoke, his thumb gently rubbed the soft flesh on the inside of her wrist twice, sending a tingling electric current through her.</p>
<p>How about that? Do you feel a surge of heat rising up? That&#x27;s my unique Chiong technique. Perfect for curing all kinds of stubbornness. Shinuan Xiao Hongi felt like she was about to explode. This isn&#x27;t taking a pulse. This is clearly sexual harassment.</p>
<p>That bastard&#x27;s fingers were as hot as a branding iron. And the tingling sensation traveled up her wrist and into her heart, causing an unusual heat to rise in her already weak body. I&#x27;m going to kill you. I absolutely have to kill you. Xiao Hongi gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>Her voice squeezed out from between her teeth. Her eyes filled with a hatred that seemed to want to devour Shin Yuan alive. Fork me. Shin Yuan released her hand and gently tidied her messy bangs. His movements were as tender as if he were whispering to a lover.</p>
<p>But the words he uttered were infuriating. Save your energy. You&#x27;re so weak and limp right now. You can&#x27;t even lift a gun. How are you going to shoot me? Instead of thinking about these irrelevant things, you should seriously consider my previous suggestion.</p>
<p>Shinyuan leaned close to her ear and whispered, &quot;When you&#x27;re all better, come to my room and I&#x27;ll help you clear your breathing completely.&quot; Just a second beforehoi was about to vomit blood from anger, Shin Yuan laughed, stood up, and strolled towards his next target with his hands behind his back. Xiao Hongi was left lying on the stretcher, her cheeks flushed red. In the end, she could only pound the bedboard in impotent rage. The next victim, no, the next person we should offer our condolences to is Chinua. Compared to Xiao Hongs popularity, Chinua&#x27;s side was much quieter.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t lying on a stretcher, but sitting on a makeshift rest chair. The few drops of blood from her vomit stained her snow white dress. But they didn&#x27;t detract from her beauty at all. Instead, they added a touch of broken, poignant beauty to her otherwise ethereal and aloof aura. She had her eyes closed and was regulating her breathing.</p>
<p>Within a 3 m radius, the ground was covered with a thin layer of white frost. Several medical staff who wanted to come up and help were shivering from the cold and dared not approach. Shin Yuan walked over, his feet crunching on the frost. Chin Schwe&#x27;s eyes were closed, but her delicate eyebrows were slightly furrowed. Is Chin, the campus bell, still alive? Shin Yuan greeted her with a grin, completely ignoring the biting cold, and plopped down next to her.</p>
<p>Chinua opened her eyes. Those icy blue eyes, devoid of any emotion, were like two bottomless pools of cold springs quietly reflecting Shan Yuans face. What is it? The voice was cold and clear, like ice beads falling onto a jade plate. Can&#x27;t you come visit your old classmates, even if there&#x27;s nothing wrong? Looking at her almost translucent white face, Shin Yuan felt a strange itch in his heart. This woman is truly made of ice.</p>
<p>Even with such a serious injury and blood still on her lips, she still maintained that aloof and superior attitude, making one want to break through her icy shell and see if she was warm inside. Chapter 168. Chin Schwe curses the scumbag. Shinuan reached out, wanting to wipe the blood stains from the corner of her mouth. Don&#x27;t move.</p>
<p>Just as his fingertips were about to touch Chinu&#x27;s cheek, buzz. An extremely sharp chill suddenly erupted from Chinu&#x27;s body. That wasn&#x27;t ordinary cold air. It was an extreme cold law imbued with the will of the SSS Level Ice Phoenix bloodline. Shin Yuans fingers were jolted back as if he had been electrocuted, and a layer of fine ice crystals even formed on his fingertips.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t touch me.&quot; Chinua looked at him coldly, a hint of disgust flashing in her eyes. &quot;Dirty!&quot; Shiny Yuan wasn&#x27;t annoyed. He shook off the ice shards from his hands and laughed even more heartily. &quot;Dirty, Chen, the school beauty. You have no conscience.</p>
<p>If it weren&#x27;t for my cough just now, if it weren&#x27;t for my outburst that shattered the illusion, you&#x27;d still be an ice sculpture on that icy plane. He leaned forward, his golden vertical pupils slightly narrowed, staring into Chinu&#x27;s eyes. Do you remember our agreement? You said that as long as I beat you in the battle of the prodigies, you would agree to my request. Shin Yuan pointed to the chaotic mess around him, then pointed to himself. Everyone else is lying down, and I&#x27;m the only one standing.</p>
<p>Does that mean I won? Chinua looked at him and her eyes finally showed a slight change. That&#x27;s contempt. Relying on luck, external forces, or even that kind of, she seemed to recall the terrifying moment before the illusion shattered, a hint of fear flashing in her eyes. But it was quickly replaced by indifference. This wasn&#x27;t true strength, and Shinwe gaze passed over Shin Yuan and went to Ling, who was rushing over here with a worried expression, not far away.</p>
<p>Then she looked at Akasha, who was sticking to Shin Yuan&#x27;s back like a piece of chewing gum. She turned her head away, no longer looking at Shun Yuan, leaving him only with a cool and stunning profile. Her red lips parted slightly, uttering two words. Scumbag Shinuan. Well, this conversation is ruined.</p>
<p>This girl&#x27;s defenses are even stronger than that of the Vudra demon ape. She&#x27;s impervious to both soft and hard tactics. However, Shinuan was not in a hurry. There is ample time. Since this iceberg already has cracks and that hint of apprehension and contempt just now was an emotional fluctuation, then it&#x27;s not far from collapsing.</p>
<p>Fine, he&#x27;s a scumbag. Then Shinuan stood up, patted his backside, and thought, &quot;I&#x27;m definitely taking first place. Let&#x27;s see what excuse you can come up with.&quot; Then after saying that, he turned and left. After taking only two steps, Shinuan suddenly slapped his forehead as if he had remembered something of paramount importance. Oh no, I was so busy flirting.</p>
<p>No, comforting our allies that I forgot about my wife. Longing that mental shock was indiscriminate. Instructor Long was also at the fifth level, but she was pregnant after all. If this harms the fetus, wouldn&#x27;t I be skinned alive? Shinyuan&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. He didn&#x27;t care about his manners anymore and ran towards the rest area of the East China Sea District.</p>
<p>However, before he could even run a few steps, a familiar tall figure strode towards us. Longing did not sit on a stretcher, nor did she ask anyone to help her. Her black combat suit accentuated her perfect waistline and long legs. And apart from being slightly pale, she appeared completely unharmed. Instructor Long, my wife.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan rushed over, hugged her tightly, and examined her thoroughly. How are you? Is anything bothering you? Does your stomach hurt? Are you dizzy? Longing was taken aback by his sudden bear hug and her cold and beautiful face instantly turned red. There are so many people watching. There are so many shots. Let go.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m fine. Longing pushed against his chest in embarrassment and annoyance, but not with much force. Are you really all right? Shinyuan was still worried, so he placed his palm on her flat and firm abdomen and carefully sensed it. That&#x27;s really strange. The oppressive force emanating from the bronze gate was so strong that even Chinua and Xiao Hongi couldn&#x27;t withstand it.</p>
<p>How come Ling was completely unharmed? Just then, the S-rank undying dragon blood within Shun Yuan&#x27;s body throbbed slightly. A strange resonance of blood emanated from Long Yings lower abdomen. There was a tiny yet incredibly resilient life there, radiating a faint golden glow. Shinyuan suddenly realized, &quot;It&#x27;s that little one who hasn&#x27;t been born yet.&quot; The terrifying pressure emanating from the bronze gate seemed to sense the shared bloodline aura as it swept over Lyings body and deliberately avoided her. It even separated a wisp of extremely pure energy to nourish the mother body and protect Lyings mind.</p>
<p>This kid already knows how to protect his mom even before he&#x27;s born. Shiny Yuan was overjoyed. This was definitely his biological son. No doubt about it. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re all right.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re all right. Shin Yuan breathed a sigh of relief. His worry instantly turning into smuggness. Not only did he not let go, but in front of countless single people and cameras, he also gave Longing a hard kiss on her smooth forehead. It seems our baby is a lucky star, immune to even this level of mental attack.</p>
<p>Longing, &quot;Oh, Dragon Lord, why are you only worried about Sister Dragon? Don&#x27;t you even ask if she&#x27;s afraid?&quot; A cloyingly sweet voice interrupted. Akasha swayed her hips as she walked over, ignoring that Ling was still in Shun Yuans arms and directly hugged one of Shun Yuans arms. Lung Yu followed behind, holding the folder in her hand. She pushed up her glasses and didn&#x27;t say anything, but her icy blue eyes clearly said, &quot;I want a hug, too. One man and three beauties.&quot; A dashing female instructor, a charming and alluring foreign countess, and a cold and aloof secretary in uniform.</p>
<p>This scene completely stunned the wounded soldiers around them who were still groaning in pain. Damn, this injury is so frustrating. I refuse to accept this. Why does he get to enjoy himself so much? This battle of prodigies is unwininnable. This is clearly Shun Yuan&#x27;s personal showcase.</p>
<p>The capital city royal number one manor. This is a place of accommodation specially prepared for the top forces from all sides participating in the battle of the prodigies. It&#x27;s called a manor, but it&#x27;s actually an extremely luxurious complex of garden villas. Each villa comes with its own private garden, swimming pool, and even a small cultivation room for vital energy. The security level meets the highest standards of the empire.</p>
<p>As the current top scorer and a privileged individual handpicked by ElderQ, Shinuan naturally received the best located and largest building, Ling Yun Pavilion. Shinyuan took a shower, changed into a loose bathrobe, and lazily leaned against the leather sofa in the living room, big enough for five people to roll around on, swirling a glass of aged wine he had taken from the wine cabinet. Longing and L Yua handle some urgent business at Umbrella Corporation. It seems that because of the accident during the day, the higher-ups need to reassess Shan Yuan&#x27;s danger level. So, tonight only he and Akasha are left in this huge villa.</p>
<p>Chapter 169. and Akasha&#x27;s flirting. The beautiful female mentor arrives at the door. Dragon Lord. A sweet alluring call wafted by accompanied by a fragrant breeze.</p>
<p>Akasha came out of the kitchen carrying a plate of sliced fruit. She was clearly dressed up carefully. Instead of wearing the elaborate black velvet dress she wore during the day, she changed into an extremely daring see-through black gauze night gown. The sheer black veil offered little cover, instead highlighting her voluuptuous, fair body with a hazy, alluring allure, especially those legs. This time, she wasn&#x27;t wearing stockings.</p>
<p>Bare feet trot on the carpet, toes painted with dark red nail polish. With each step, her fair thighs crossed beneath the black gauze, dazzling the eye. She walked up to Shun Yuan, but instead of placing the fruit plate on the table, she knelt directly on the carpet, raised the fruit plate above her head, and tilted her stunningly beautiful face up, her purple eyes shimmering with tears. Dragon Lord, have some fruit. This posture is so humble, it&#x27;s almost grotesque, yet it&#x27;s sexy to the core.</p>
<p>Shinuan looked down at her. From this angle, the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. You vixen. Shinyuan put down his wine glass, picked up a grape, but instead of putting it in his own mouth, he offered it to Akasha&#x27;s lips. &quot;Hey,&quot; Akasha&#x27;s eyes lit up, she snatched the grape, put it in her mouth without biting it.</p>
<p>&quot;We  sweet, Dragon Lord.&quot; Akasha didn&#x27;t back away. Her cheek was pressed against his bathrobe. &quot;You worked so hard during the daytime competition. People saw that you were sweating a lot, and thankfully you weren&#x27;t injured, but you must have been very tired, right?&quot; Her voice trailed off. It&#x27;s just the two of us here.</p>
<p>Sister Long and Sister Long aren&#x27;t here. Could you let Akasha help you relax? As she spoke, her fingertips hooked onto the tie of Shun Yuan&#x27;s bathrobe and gently pulled it. The bathrobe unfurled. It revealed Shun Yuan&#x27;s strong and muscular chest and abs. Akasha gazed at the explosively powerful body, a hint of infatuation flashing in her eyes.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a perfect body forged from Sgrade dragon blood. Every touch made every cell in her body cheer with joy. Shinyuan leaned back on the sofa, tilted his head back, looked at the dazzling crystal chandelier on the ceiling, his Adam&#x27;s apple bobbed, and he let out a comfortable sigh. This is life. What&#x27;s the point of fighting and killing? A wife, kids, a warm bed, and a stunning beauty like this serving you.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t trade that for a god. Just as the atmosphere in the room was gradually heating up and the air was filled with the burning smell of hormones, Shinuan was preparing to take charge and begin tonight&#x27;s main course. Ding-dong. An extremely untimely yet crisp and melodious doorbell ring suddenly shattered this idyllic moment. Shinyuan frowned.</p>
<p>Who is it visiting so late at night? Akasha was so angry she almost bit someone. She had finally built up the atmosphere to this point and they were about to get to eat the meat. When who was the fool to come and ruin it? Never mind him, Dragon Lord. Akasha looked up at Shinuan with teary eyes. They&#x27;re probably just a delivery person or a salesperson.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s continue. Ding-dong, ding-dong. The doorbell seemed to be defiantly challenging them, ringing one after another, unhurriedly, but with a persistent air of determination that it would keep ringing until they opened the door. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; Shinyuan cursed under his breath. His mood had been abruptly interrupted, and it felt like a lump of fleg was stuck in his throat, making him extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He pulled Akasha off him, fastened his bathrobe, and stood up with a dark expression. I&#x27;m going to see which clueless idiot is it. If he doesn&#x27;t have anything important to say, I&#x27;ll throw him into the pool to feed the fish. Shinyuan stormed to the entrance and flung open the heavy carved door. Who is it? Announcing a death so late at night.</p>
<p>However, the moment the door opened, the curse word that was about to be uttered by Shin Yuan was abruptly cut off. The person standing at the door was neither a deliver man nor a reckless salesman. It was a woman, a voluuptuous and alluring woman, yet dangerously so that she makes your heart pound. She looks to be around 30 years old, which is the age when a woman is most mature and still has the most charm. She wore a deep purple high-lit Chong Sam with a neat and fitted cut that hugged her voluuptuous figure, perfectly outlining her striking S-curve with a defined waist and hips, exuding a sophisticated and alluring charm amidst her fullness.</p>
<p>The slit extended all the way to the top of her thigh, and as she stood, a pair of long, slender, and plump white legs were exposed to the air without reservation. She wore a pair of black stiletto heels, her instep arched, making her incredibly sexy. She held a delicate folding fan in her hand, gently waving it, releasing a subtle fragrance that blended orchids with some strange musk. Her face was as beautiful as a peach blossom with a natural charm in every corner of her eyes and brows, especially her eyes, which were watery and seemed to be electrifying when she looked at you. But what alarmed Shin Yuan the most was the aura emanating from this woman.</p>
<p>She smiled and seemed harmless. But the S-level dragon blood within Shin Yuan was sending out frantic warnings. Danger. Extremely dangerous. This woman&#x27;s strength is unfathomable.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s at least the eighth realm or even the ninth realm. Hey, Shin Yuan, don&#x27;t get so angry. The woman looked at Shaun Yuan&#x27;s disheveled appearance, clearly indicating that his good time had been interrupted. Instead of being angry, she covered her mouth and chuckled. Her alluring eyes swept over him, finally settling on his open collar.</p>
<p>Is it inappropriate for the teacher to come for a home visit so late at night? Shin Yuan cautiously took a half step back, his hand already secretly reaching for the Phoenix token behind his waist. Who are you? How did you get in? The security here is so good that not even a fly can get in. How could this woman appear at the door so quietly? Let me introduce myself. The woman closed her folding fan and extended a very well-maintained hand. her fingertips painted with purple nail polish.</p>
<p>I am Hua Nong Ying, a special grade instructor at the seventh martial arts academy of the Star River Alliance. You can call me teacher Hua or you can call me Sister Hua. She took a step forward and the rich fragrance instantly wafted over, forcing Shin Yuan into a corner. I came to you to provide after school tutoring. Huan Nonging stretched out her finger and gently drew a circle on Shun Yuans chest, her voice becoming and ambiguous.</p>
<p>regarding your physical talent that could destroy the heavenly eye system. The teacher is very interested. Shinyuan looked at the woman who was coiling around him like a beautiful snake and is Adam&#x27;s apple bobbed. What kind of mentor is this? She&#x27;s clearly a man-eating vixen. Moreover, the seventh martial arts academy, that legendary behemoth that exists in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>These thighs seem even thicker than old chines. Shin Yuans eyes darted around and the weary expression on his face vanished instantly, quickly replaced by his signature shameless smile. He grabbed Huan Nongyings mischievous hand and took control of it, kneading it gently. Oh, it&#x27;s teacher Hua. My apologies for not recognizing you.</p>
<p>Forget about tutoring or anything like that. That&#x27;s too formal. Shinyuan turned to the side and gestured for her to proceed, but his eyes were fixed on the thigh exposed by the slit in the Chong Sam. Since you&#x27;re here, why don&#x27;t you come in and have a seat? Perfect timing. My bed? No, I mean my sofa is big enough.</p>
<p>We can have a proper tutoring session. Chapter 170. Teacher Hua Show of Force. Would you like to come in and have a seat? Huan Nongings captivating peach blossom eyes curved slightly, and with a snap, her folding fan snapped shut, the fan ribs lightly tapping Shin Yuans hand. Instead of dodging, she took a step forward.</p>
<p>He stepped into the entrance hall, almost touching Shun Yuan&#x27;s body. The fragrance, a blend of orchid and some strange musk, instantly intensified several times over, as if it were intoxicating one&#x27;s senses. Shin Yuan is indeed a good student who respects his teachers. Her red lips parted slightly. Her voice is soft and sweet as a cotton candy that wouldn&#x27;t melt.</p>
<p>But her beautiful eyes looked past Shin Yuans shoulder and landed directly on Akasha, who was wearing a see-through black veil and staring at them wearily in the living room. Since you&#x27;re so enthusiastic, then I, as your teacher, will gladly accept your offer. Shin Yuan stepped aside, but inwardly cursed this woman as a monster. In that brief moment of contact, the S-rank dragon blood within him stirred an intense, restless hunger like a ravenous wolf smelling the finest meat. This Hanonging is definitely not an ordinary master.</p>
<p>A huge secret is hidden inside her body. The two entered the living room one after the other. The originally romantic and ambiguous atmosphere instantly turned tense with the arrival of this uninvited guest. Akasha was still kneeling on the carpet, her black gauze night gown barely concealing her alluring figure, but she didn&#x27;t care about hiding it at the moment. Her violet eyes stared coldly at Huan Nongying like a lioness whose territory had been invaded, her furs standing on end.</p>
<p>Her woman&#x27;s intuition told her that this woman who had suddenly barged in was a formidable adversary. Moreover, he is a formidable enemy who is 10,000 times more dangerous than naive young girls like Chinua and Xiao Hongi. Look at that ripe figure. Look at that Chong Sam with a slit up to her thigh. And look at those fox-like eyes that seem to speak volumes.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t a mentor. This is clearly someone trying to steal our food. Dragon Lord Akasha stood up from the carpet, walked barefoot to Shaun Yuan&#x27;s side, and naturally took his arm, pressing her whole body against him, her declaration of ownership almost overflowing. She raised her delicate chin and looked at Huan Nongying with a gaze that carried a hint of hostility and arrogance. Who is this lady? Why is she out at someone else&#x27;s house so late at night instead of taking care of her grandson? Auntie taking care of grandchildren.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuans eyelids twitched and he thought to himself, &quot;Oh no, this foreign girl really dares to speak her mind.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; Juan Nongings smile froze for a moment, then deepened. But that smile sent chills down one&#x27;s spine, no matter how you looked at it. She waved her folding fan and walked gracefully to the sofa, acting as if she were a guest of honor and sat down in the most comfortable spot. As she moved, the hem of her Chong Samsam slipped down, revealing a large expanse of fair skin. Her long, shapely legs were crossed and swaying gently, the tips of her black high heels gleaming softly under the lights.</p>
<p>That little Rothschild girl has quite the sharp tom. Huan Noming leaned lazily against the back of the sofa, glancing at Akasha with a nonchalant look, as if she were looking at a little kitten with its claws outstretched. However, to break through to the sixth realm in such a short time, it seems that Shin Yuan has fed you quite well. She emphasized the word feed in her voice, her tone carrying a hint of teasing and disdain. You Akasha was hit where it hurt and was enraged by the other party&#x27;s condescending attitude, so she was about to lash out.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care who you are. This is Ling Yun Pavilion. It&#x27;s Mai and the Dragon Lord&#x27;s private space. No outsiders are welcome. Akasha released Shun Yuan and blood red light surged in her palm with countless elucory blood red roses blooming around her.</p>
<p>The oppressive aura of a sixthrem marshall king was released without reservation, directly approaching Huan Nonging on the sofa. Get out of here right now, or don&#x27;t blame me for tearing your mouth apart. Faced with this overwhelming pressure of blood energy, Huan Nonging didn&#x27;t even lift her eyelids. She simply extended a well-maintained finger and gently tapped it into the air. Noisy buzz.</p>
<p>There were no earthshattering explosions, nor any dazzling light and shadow effects. With just a casual flick of her finger, the crimson roses surrounding Akasha were instantly crushed by an invisible hand, turning into specks of red light and dissipating. Immediately afterwards, an indescribable, terrifying gravity descended upon Akasha out of nowhere. Akasha let out a muffled groan. Her legs went weak, and she couldn&#x27;t control her body at all.</p>
<p>With a thud, she knelt down on the carpet again. No matter how she tried to activate her inner energy, no matter how much she struggled, that force was like an ancient divine mountain pressing down on her back, making it impossible for her to even move a finger. Cold sweat instantly soaked through the black veil, covering her body. How could this be? Akasha looked up in horror at the woman who was still smiling and whose posture hadn&#x27;t changed at all. Just one finger? He suppressed me.</p>
<p>A sixth realm marshall king. What kind of monster is this woman? Ninth realm or 10th realm? Little girl, you&#x27;re used to being a queen in the Federation. Haven&#x27;t you learned how to be a decent person here yet? Huan Nong Ying withdrew her finger, picked up the half-finished glass of wine that Shin Yuan had just drunk from, and gently swirled it in her hand. This is only because of Shun Yuan sake. If it were anywhere else, anyone who dared to talk to me like that would be buried 2 m tall by now.</p>
<p>She took a sip of wine, and her alluring eyes looked at Shin Yuan again, her gaze shifting as if the doineering queen who had just casually suppressed the Sixth Realm expert was not her at all. Shin Yuan, your little wild cat has some sharp claws. Let me trim your nails for you. You won&#x27;t mind, will you? Shinyuan stood aside and witnessed the whole scene, his heart filled with turmoil. That&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>This effortless skill is even more terrifying than that of the exquisite war god. These are the instructors from the Star River Alliance and the Seventh Martial Arts Academy. Is this the foundation of a cosmic level powerhouse? But Shin Yuan walked over with a bright smile, bent down, and helped Akasha up from her kneeling position, gently soothing her trembling back with his large hand. &quot;Teacher Hua is joking.&quot; Shin Yuan shielded Akasha behind him. His gaze meeting Huan Nongys alluring eyes without flinching.</p>
<p>My cat is indeed a bit wild, but Shin Yuans lips curled into a rogish smile. I love her wild side. Besides, you have to consider the owner before you beat a dog. Teacher Hua, you gave me a hard time the moment you walked in. Isn&#x27;t that a bit disrespectful of me as a student? Huan Noming looked at Shun Yuans protective demeanor, and her admiration deepened.</p>
<p>They were able to chat and laugh, even under the slight pressure she had just released, and even dared to challenge her. This little guy&#x27;s courage and temperament are truly a gem among rough stones. Oh dear, how could the teacher bear to give you a hard time? Huan Nonging put down her wine glass, leaned forward, and a breathtaking glimpse of her snow white cleavage was revealed at the neckline of her Chong Sam. The teacher is just worried that you&#x27;ll be ruined by beautiful women, so she came to help you check things out. She patted the spot next to her, her voice becoming even more seductive.</p>
<p>Come and sit down. Let&#x27;s get down to business. Shin Yuan patted Akashas hand, signaling her to calm down, then swaggered over and pllopped down next to Huan Nongying. They were so close they could almost feel each other&#x27;s body heat. Serious business.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan turned his head, his gaze sweeping unabashedly over her beautiful face and devilish figure. Didn&#x27;t teacher Hua just say she would give me after school tutoring? I wonder if this tutoring is for biology or physical education. Huan Noming didn&#x27;t seem to care about his unrestrained gaze. In fact, she seemed to enjoy being watched. She reached out and gently placed her fingertips on Shun Yuan&#x27;s wrist to feel his pulse.</p>
<p>This time it was no longer a test, but a gentle yet doineering aura that instantly flowed through Shun Yuan&#x27;s entire body along his meridians. Tsk tsk tsk. A few seconds later, Huan Nonging withdrew her hand and let out a heartfelt exclamation. It is indeed top-notch. His blood and energy flowed like a dragon.</p>
<p>His bones were like jade, and his meridians were incredibly broad and resilient. Most importantly, her gaze fell on Shan Yuans lower abdomen, and she licked her red lips with the tip of her tongue. The life essence contained within it is so rich that one would want to swallow it whole. Shin Yuan, you are simply the most perfect masterpiece bestowed upon this starry sky by heaven. Chapter 171.</p>
<p>Primitive evolutionary factions. I want to bring my family. Shinuan felt a little uncomfortable with her blatantly lustful remarks and coughed lightly. Teacher Hua, I know I&#x27;m handsome, but your praise is making me almost embarrassed. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point.</p>
<p>You came all this way in the middle of the night. Surely not just to give me a compliment. Juan Nonging toned down her flirtatious manner, and her expression became slightly more serious. Shinyuan, I have a question for you. Do you want to see the real universe? The real universe? Shinyuan raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Juan Nonging stood up, walked to the French windows, and pointed to the dazzling starry sky outside. Blue Star is too small for a genius like you. This place is like a shallow puddle. Even if you become the king here, even if you collect all the beauties on this planet, you will still just be a goldfish trapped in a fishbowl.</p>
<p>She turned around, her back to the starlight, and her whole being seemed to be bathed in a sacred glow. In that vast sea of stars, there are countless life-bearing planets like Blue Star, civilizations of myriad races and supreme beings capable of plucking stars from the sky and treading on the sun and moon. That&#x27;s the stage you should be on. On behalf of the seventh martial arts academy of the Star River Alliance, I formally extend this invitation to you. Huan Nonging looked at Shin Yuan and invited him, enunciating each word clearly.</p>
<p>Become my personal disciple. Come with me. Seventh Martial Arts Academy. Shin Yuan leaned back on the sofa, his fingers lightly tapping the leather armrest as he chewed on these words. Although I had heard of this name from Elderqin and Le Yun before and knew that it was a sacred cultivation ground within the human race&#x27;s territory, being invited in person by a top level instructor from there was still a different kind of impact.</p>
<p>Akasha, who was standing next to her, was so shocked that she stopped breathing. The Seventh Martial Arts Academy. That&#x27;s a place that every martial artist in the entire Federation dreams of entering. It is said that as long as you can get in and get some experience, even if you are just a menial disciple, you can walk around the Federation with impunity after you come out. And even the patriarchs of big families will treat you as an honored guest.</p>
<p>And now this woman actually wants to take the dragon lord as her personal disciple. Teacher Hua, you&#x27;ve painted a pretty big picture. Shinyuan did not show the expected elation. He remained calm and even had the leisure to pick up a grape and put it in his mouth. However, I&#x27;m a practical person.</p>
<p>Going to a place like outer space sounds exciting, but what if you get bullied in an unfamiliar place? Moreover, Shin Yuan sized Huan Nongying up and down. What are the specific benefits of being your student? For example, could you teach me some impressive skills? Huan Nongying was even more satisfied with his composed demeanor. If it were a country bumpkin who had never seen the world, he would probably be kneeling down and cowtowing in gratitude by now. Benefit Janu chuckled softly, walked back to the sofa, and sat down, her beautiful legs naturally crossed. Shinuan, do you know which factions exist within the domain academy? Before Shinuan could answer, she began to count off her fingers as if they were precious treasures.</p>
<p>The mainstream one is the temple of war. Those muscle-bound barbarians who only know how to fight and kill all day long. They practice the path of physical ascension to saintthood, which is boring and tedious. Then there are the elemental towers, a bunch of charlatans who play with wind, fire, thunder, and lightning. They lock themselves in towers all day to study the laws.</p>
<p>They are very powerful, but their bodies are as fragile as paper. If someone gets close to them, they are dead. As for the Mechanicus cult and the psychokinesis association, those are all unorthodox and heretical practices. At this point, Huaning paused, a look of extreme pride appearing on her face. The faction to which I, Huan Nomying, belong is called primal evolution.</p>
<p>Primitive evolution. Shin Yuan became interested. It sounded intriguing. What exactly did it involve? Huan Noming leaned forward and her delicate fragrance enveloped Shin Yuan once again. Simply put, it is about studying the most fundamental mysteries of life.</p>
<p>We do not rely on external objects or a single elemental law. We explore the infinite potential of the human body by studying genes, bloodlines, and the profound principles of Ein and Yang harmony. She stretched out her fingertip and drew circles on Shy Yuan&#x27;s chest. Her voice becoming extremely seductive. Your body, your bloodline, and your special talent are practically tailorade for our faction.</p>
<p>If you follow me, I will not only impart all my knowledge to you, but also provide you with the most advanced gene serums and the most luxurious cultivation resources in the entire universe. Even Juan Noming leaned close to Shun Yuans ear, her breath as fragrant as orchids. I myself can also be your research subject as long as you are strong enough to withstand the teacher&#x27;s guidance. Boom. Upon hearing this, Shin Yuan felt a surge of anger rising within him.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t recruiting students. This is clearly inviting, you know. Moreover, it&#x27;s the kind of good thing where you can learn skills and cough cough, cultivate yourself. If you refuse, are you even a man? However, Shin Yuan still retained a sliver of reason. He glanced at Akasha beside him, who though not daring to speak, had eyes full of grievance and worry.</p>
<p>He also thought of Lin Sharon, who was still waiting for him in the East China Sea, and of Ling, L Yu, and Su Ching Zhu. Teacher Hua, the offer is indeed very tempting. Shin Yuan suppressed the restlessness in his heart, but I have a problem. I love my home. Moreover, I&#x27;m a rather greedy person.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t bear to throw away any of the bottles, jars, flowers, or plants in my house. Shin Yuan pointed at Akasha, then pointed in the direction of the East China Sea. If I&#x27;m to go to the Department of Domain Studies, can I bring my family members? Bring family members? Huan Nong Yings smile faded slightly and her brows furrowed. Shinuan, the domain academy, is not a vegetable market, much less a daycare center. That is the place where the backbone of humanity is nurtured, and every resource there is extremely precious.</p>
<p>She glanced at Akasha, her tone turning somewhat cold. This little girl&#x27;s aptitude is passable. She can barely be an outer disciple. But as for your other women, if I may be frank, apart from that girl with the ice phoenix bloodline and that one who plays with guns and has some potential, the rest would only be a burden if you brought them along. Moreover, cultivating with a group of women will only distract you and ruin your path.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Shin Yuans smile faded slightly. Teacher Hua, is there nothing to discuss now? To me, they are not a burden, but my lifeblood. If I were to abandon my wife and children to pursue some grand path, then I&#x27;d rather not pursue it at all. Shiny Yuan leaned back on the sofa, adopting an attitude of then forget it. Anyway, I&#x27;m quite content being a local tyrant on Earth with a wife, kids, and a warm bed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all so comfortable. Chapter 172. The impatient mentor. Shin Yuan is reluctant to part with her. You, Shin Yuan&#x27;s unyielding attitude made Huan Nonging laugh in exasperation.</p>
<p>So many people have begged her to take them as disciples, but she hasn&#x27;t even glanced at them. This kid, on the other hand, is acting all high and mighty. But then she thought, &quot;Isn&#x27;t Shin Yuan&#x27;s loyal and righteous character exactly what she values? If it were a cold-blooded person who would abandon everything for power, she wouldn&#x27;t dare to devote herself to cultivating them.&quot; &quot;All right, all right, stop giving me that sour look.&quot; Huan Noming sighed helplessly and gently tapped Shin Yuans head with her folding fan. I didn&#x27;t say you had to abandon them. Let&#x27;s compromise.</p>
<p>Juan Noming took out a crystal clearar romboid-shaped crystal that emitted spatial fluctuations from her storage ring and tossed it to Shin Yuan. This is a Stargate positioning stone. Once you arrive at the domain academy and formally become my disciple, I will apply to the academy to have a small intergalactic teleportation array built specifically for you. Although you can&#x27;t have them stay at the domain academy permanently, you can come back anytime or bring them over for a short stay. And a glint of light flashed in Huan Nongyings eyes as long as you perform well enough and demonstrate value that the hospital has to take seriously at that time, let alone bringing family members.</p>
<p>Even if you wanted to pack up the entire blue star and move it next to the domain academy to use as your backyard, no one would dare to say no. Shinuan took the positioning stone. It felt warm and smooth to the touch, as if it contained an endless starry sky. Can you come back anytime? Can you even package up the entire earth? These conditions are quite generous. Make a deal.</p>
<p>Shinyuan&#x27;s expression immediately changed. He grinned and tucked the positioning stone into his pocket, then grabbed Juan Nomiing hand and shook it vigorously. Teacher, please accept my bow, but let&#x27;s skip the formal apprenticeship ceremony. Given our relationship, there&#x27;s no need to be so formal. Huanoming pulled her hand away and glared at him irritably.</p>
<p>Stop arguing with me. Since you&#x27;ve agreed, don&#x27;t procrastinate. This battle of the prodigies is ridiculous. You shouldn&#x27;t participate in the rest of the competitions either. Juan Noming stood up, straightened the hem of her Chong Sam, and regained her aura as a person of high status.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the point of playing house with a bunch of kids? I&#x27;ve already spoken to that old guy Ching Jean, so you don&#x27;t need to continue in this year&#x27;s heavenly pride tournament. Pack your things and come with me tonight. Leaving tonight? Shin Yuan hadn&#x27;t even warmed his backside on the leather sofa when he heard this, and his eyebrows immediately furrowed into a knot. He toyed with the Stargate positioning stone, which was still warm from his body, and stared at Huan Nonging with an expression as if she were a lunatic. Teacher Hua, aren&#x27;t you being a little too hasty? Shin Yuan leaned back, sinking into the soft back rest, his long legs dangling unceremoniously on the coffee table, nearly knocking over the expensive bottle of red wine.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve only just met. We haven&#x27;t even had a proper toast, and we haven&#x27;t even done the foreplay yet, and you&#x27;re already trying to elope with me. If word gets out, what will become of my reputation? Shinuan elopment? Juan Nomis eyes twitched with anger at these absurd words, and she slapped Shin Yuans calf with her exquisite folding fan. The force wasn&#x27;t very strong, but it carried a tingling electric current that made one&#x27;s bones itch. Stop arguing with me.</p>
<p>Who wants to elope with you? Juan Noming stood up, her purple Chong Sam taught with the movement, highlighting a stunning curve in her waist and hips. She paced back and forth in the living room, her high heels making a dull sound on the carpet, indicating her anxiety. How could she not be anxious? Just now when the elucory image of that bronze gate spanning the universe was projected above blue star, her communicator which was connected to the highest authority of the domain academy was almost overwhelmed by the massive data stream. Even though that aura was fleeting, it was concealed by the thin atmospheric laws of blue star. But Huan Nonging knew the truth.</p>
<p>That was absolutely a forbidden power that touched the very origin of the universe. The source of this power lies in this seemingly carefree but actually unfathomable little man before us. What&#x27;s worse, before she came, she used all her connections in the domain academy and even incurred a favor to secretly access a file that was classified as top secret. On the cover of the file is a crimson thorn flower emblem, a symbol of supreme imperial power. That is the personal mark of the 13th domain lord, the current empress of the human realm.</p>
<p>Who is her majesty the empress? That is an existence that stands above all living beings in the universe and can cause even the Milky Way to flow backward with a single stomp of its foot. Over the years, the Empress has never shown even the slightest interest in any male creature. And even those cosmic giants with god-like bloodlines find it incredibly difficult to get an audience with her. Yet, they issued such an intriguing secret order to this little guy who came from a barren planet and had awakened an F-level talent. The entire nation&#x27;s strength was mobilized to protect its safety.</p>
<p>If the EC were breached, cities would be abandoned to save people. Huan Nonging felt a sudden panic as she looked at the man in front of her who was opening his mouth to receive the grapes that Akasha was feeding him. This is hardly some kind of fgrade trash. This is clearly the empress&#x27;s kept man in her fish pond. If those old hags in the domain academy who don&#x27;t get along with her, or those ancient families who keep an eye on the empress&#x27;s movements realize this, then there will be no chance for Huan Nonging to get her hands on this piece of fat meat that&#x27;s already in her mouth.</p>
<p>We might not even get to drink the soup. We must take it with us immediately. Right now, the master has already made the relationship between master and disciple irrevocably established so that even if the empress herself were to arrive, it would be as if the rice had been cooked. Huan Noming was also this boy&#x27;s mentor, and no one could sever this connection. Thinking of this, a resolute glint flashed in Huan Nomyings peach blossom eyes.</p>
<p>She turned around, walked a few steps to Shun Yuan, placed her hands on the armrests of the sofa, and leaned down with an extremely imposing presence. Her face, as beautiful as a peach blossom, drew near to Shin Yuan. The rich fragrance of orchids mixed with her unique mature charm almost overwhelmed Shin Yuan. Shinuan, listen to me carefully. Huan Nong Ying abandoned her playful and charming demeanor, her tone becoming more serious than ever before.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not kidding you. The commotion you caused on the field today has gone beyond your control. For you, Blue Star is not just a shallow puddle, but a powder keg that could explode at any moment. Once those old monsters hiding in the shadows smell your scent, let alone Sheen Jean, that old man with one foot in the grave. Even if you filled the entire blue star, it wouldn&#x27;t be enough to fill their teeth.</p>
<p>She stretched out her finger and pointed it hard at Shinuan&#x27;s chest. Only by returning to the domain academy with me and joining my primal evolutionary faction, protected by the domain academyy&#x27;s law array, will you be safe. Only then can I legitimately keep those who want to harm you away. So, stop doawling. Don&#x27;t pack your things.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t bring yourself. I&#x27;ll provide you with the best of everything when we get there. Now, come with me immediately. As she spoke, she reached out to grab Shin Yuans arm, intending to use a spatial technique to forcibly take him away. However, a large hand, however, grabbed her wrist instead.</p>
<p>Shinuans palm was broad and strong, and his palm was burning hot. The heat rushed from Huan Nongys wrist to her heart, causing her spatial energy, which was originally ready to be unleashed, to dissipate instantly. Teacher Hua, the way you&#x27;re saying that makes it sound like I&#x27;m some kind of spineless coward who only knows how to hide behind a woman&#x27;s skirt for protection. Shinuan was not intimidated by her alarmist words. He remained lounging lazily on the sofa, but in his originally dark eyes, golden vertical pupils were faintly contracting and expanding, revealing a wild and untamed nature.</p>
<p>Safety in my life, Shinuan has never lacked danger. Shin Yuan applied a little force, pulling Huan Nonging even closer until their nose is almost touched. Besides, you&#x27;re just telling me to leave like this. Did you even ask for my opinion? My family at Dong Hai Company is waiting for me to come back and pay their dues. Ly Yings baby hasn&#x27;t even been born yet.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu, that human nuclear weapon, is still in the lab waiting for my data. And Shin Yuan started listing the dishes on his fingers like reciting a menu. And then there&#x27;s Xiao Hongi with such a fiery temper. I won&#x27;t be satisfied until I strip her of that red armor. Chinua, that icyfaced girl, just coughed up blood today because of my shock.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t even had a chance to give her CPR yet. If I die now, she&#x27;ll hate me for the rest of her life. Chapter 173, so-called local specialties. Juan Nongings greeting gift. Oh, right.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan seemed to suddenly remember something important and slapped his thigh. There are also Mu Wan Bing and Muing Shua. Upon hearing these two names, Huan Ying paused for a moment. Although she had done her homework before coming, she mainly focused on the list of the prodigy battle and was not very familiar with these two names. &quot;Where did these wild flowers come from?&quot; Huanonging asked irritably.</p>
<p>&quot;Wild flowers? Those are domestic flowers? The domestic flowers of the reserve force.&quot; Shin yuan looked on with longing, a wicked smile that was incredibly irritating. Mu Wan Bang, the icy female CEO, controls the empire&#x27;s largest industrial group and exudes the true aura of a mature and sophisticated woman. Mu Ching Shiua, the Empress of the Empire, with that voice and that figure, &quot;If only she could cough and sing me a song, that would be wonderful.&quot; Shin Yuan became more and more excited as he spoke, completely ignoring Huan Nong Yings increasingly dark expression. I haven&#x27;t even won over any of these top tier beauties yet. If I go with you and some other bastard ends up with them, wouldn&#x27;t I be incredibly upset? No.</p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. Shin Yuan shook his head vigorously, looking like a rogue who wouldn&#x27;t leave, even if the heavenly king himself came. At least I have to finish this battle of geniuses. Get all these targets stamped and then I have to go back to the East China Sea to settle things at home.</p>
<p>Otherwise, forget it. Huaning felt like she was about to break apart after hearing this series of reasons. She, a top level instructor from the seventh martial arts academy, went to great lengths to descend upon this barren land, proactively offering to take on disciples and even offering to contribute resources herself. And what was the result? This bastard actually rejected her without hesitation for the sake of a few women and that trivial matter of his lower body. Shinuan Huaning was so angry that her chest heaved violently and the snow white collar of her Chong Sam almost popped out.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s in your head? Sperm. That&#x27;s the domain academy. It&#x27;s a sacred place that every human in the universe would kill to get into. Do you know how many star system resources a single spot can be traded for on the black market? You actually want to postpone your school enrollment for the sake of a few indigenous women? What&#x27;s wrong with the indigenous women? Shinyuan was displeased. He grabbed Akasha, who was standing next to him, and gave the countess a hard kiss on her beautiful face.</p>
<p>Akasha is also a native. Teacher Hua, look at her figure. How is she inferior to those alien women? When Akasha was called out in public, she snuggled closer to Shun Yuan and even defiantly raised her chin at Huan Nongying. Besides, Shin Yuan raised his head, his eyes becoming somewhat deep, even carrying a seriousness that Huan Nonging couldn&#x27;t understand. Teacher Hua, you study primordial evolution.</p>
<p>You should know this better than I do. My path lies neither in arduous practice nor in sudden enlightenment. My path lies in this mortal world in each and every vibrant and fragrant place. If I don&#x27;t clear my mind and take advantage of what I can, even if I go to the domain academy, I will still be a useless person with unclear thoughts. How can I evolve? This is called following your heart.</p>
<p>Do you understand? Juan Noming opened her mouth wanting to refute but found herself speechless. Because from the perspective of the theory of primitive evolution, what this kid said actually seems to have some twisted logic. Huaning felt like she was about to have a heart attack. Who is she? A top tier instructor at the seventh martial arts academy of the Star River Alliance. The second in command of the Primal Evolution faction, a figure so powerful that even 11th Realm Star Lords would bow and scrape before him, calling him the flower realm lord on this god-forsaken planet.</p>
<p>I was actually rejected by a kid who hasn&#x27;t even grown his first hair yet. The reason is still to achieve one&#x27;s goals and win over women. If this were at the domain academy, anyone who dared to speak to her like that would have been stuffed into the gene recombination chamber for re-engineering long ago. But ironically, what this kid said actually made a damn good point. The lineage of primitive evolution emphasizes returning to simplicity and following one&#x27;s nature.</p>
<p>Suppressing desires is something aesthetic monks do. True evolvers should be like wild beasts, eating and sleeping as they please. Only when their thoughts are clear can their genetic locks be unlocked smoothly. Fine, you&#x27;re good. Huan Nonging took a deep breath, both out of anger and shock.</p>
<p>She pllopped back down on the sofa, abandoning her hottie demeanor, and crossed her legs, even kicking her high heels aside without any regard for her image, revealing her exquisite feet encased in fleshcoled stockings, stepping onto the expensive Persian carpet. Shinuan, I&#x27;ve met countless people in my life, but you&#x27;re the first one I&#x27;ve ever met who&#x27;s so shameless and self-righteous. Huan Noming waved her folding fan, pointed at Shun Yuans nose, and laughed angrily, postponing school enrollment for the sake of a few women. Fine, I&#x27;ll take that as you practicing the ways of the primitive sect. But she abruptly changed the subject, a slight glint appearing in her peach blossom eyes, as if she had thought of something amusing.</p>
<p>Since you insist on staying as a teacher, it would seem petty of me not to give you a small gift. A gift to mark our meeting? Shin Yuans ears perked up. His previous shameless demeanor vanished instantly, and he leaned closer, grinning ingratiatingly. I knew teacher Hua was kind to people. What kind of good thing is it? A magical artifact or some kind of secret manual that can destroy a planet with one punch.</p>
<p>Huan rolled her eyes at him and flipped her wrist. There were no spectacular light effects. Instead, a small pink crystal bottle appeared in her palm. The bottle contained half a bottle of pale golden liquid, viscous and clear, still swaying slightly as if countless tiny stars were floating inside. What is this? Miracle water? Shinuan took it and shook it.</p>
<p>This is the prized possession of our original evolutionary faction, a source essence that countless inner disciples would kill for. Juan Noming leaned close to his ear, lowered her voice, and spoke in an extremely ambiguous tone. Its name is the primal seed. The primal seed, Shinuans Adams apple bobbed. This name didn&#x27;t sound very respectable.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get the wrong idea. It does have some effects in that area. Juan Noming extended her finger and tapped Shinuan&#x27;s chest. While your current body is incredibly strong, that esgray dragon blood is far too doineering. At that time, it was essentially a one-sided plunder or brutal infusion.</p>
<p>This not only wasted your vital energy, but also did more harm than good to those individuals. Shinuan blushed. This bottle of primordial seed contains a special type of active nanobiomass. Juan Nongying explained, &quot;If you drink it, these little guys will parasetize the meridians in your well that part of your body. They will build a perfect energy cycle system in the future.</p>
<p>When you are intimate, you will not only not feel tired, but you will also be able to transform excess dragon energy into the gentlest life energy and give it back to your partner.&quot; In short, Huanomiing her eyes alluring breathed into his ear. It doubles your fighting power, gives you unlimited stamina, and even makes the woman with you beautiful, long lived, and helps her break through to higher realms. The real you is good, and so is she. What? Shin Yuan&#x27;s hand trembled, and he almost dropped the bottle. This is hardly a greeting gift.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate cheat code for a multi-female protagonist. If this thing were mass-produced and sold, those interstellar tycoons would be furious. Teacher, dear teacher, Shin Yuan was truly impressed now, and he grabbed Huan Nomyings hand, his eyes welling up with tears of emotion. This isn&#x27;t just tutoring, it&#x27;s a life-saving grace. With this, what&#x27;s there to fear in a chaotic situation? Huan Noming withdrew her hand and wiped it on his clothes with disgust.</p>
<p>Stop being so glib. I&#x27;ve given you the stuff. If next time we meet, you&#x27;re still a weakling at the fourth level or haven&#x27;t even managed to win over those women. She stood up, put her high heels back on, and released that suffocating aura of power once again. I&#x27;ll castrate you and take you back to the imperial palace to be the chief unic.</p>
<p>After saying that, she didn&#x27;t give Shin Yuan a chance to react at all and tore through space with her hand. A pitch black crack appeared out of nowhere. Before leaving, Hanongian glanced back at Akasha, who was standing beside her with a weary expression. then looked at Shin Yuan, a meaningful smile playing on her lips. Don&#x27;t waste the teacher&#x27;s good intentions.</p>
<p>Chapter 174. The battle between the iceberg and the fairy. The blueprints have arrived. Buzz. The space closed and the alluring yet extremely dangerous woman vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Only a faint fragrance of orchids remained in the air, a testament to her presence. The living room fell silent again. Shin Yuan clutched the small pink bottle in his hand, feeling the intense heat burning his palm. He turned his head and met Akashas large, watery violet eyes. This usually ruthless countess was now biting her lower lip, her gaze fixed on the small bottle, her cheeks as red as a ripe apple.</p>
<p>She understood. The terrifying woman said that drinking this would make the dragon lord stronger and would also bring her as a woman immense benefits. Dragon Lord. Akashas voice trembled, carrying a ticklish cat-like quality. She stepped forward and reached out her delicate white hand to untie the belt of Shan Yuans bathrobe.</p>
<p>The gift that teacher gave. Why don&#x27;t we try it out now and see how it goes? Shin Yuan looked at the beauty in his arms, then at the bottle in his hand. Try. You have to try it. If we don&#x27;t try it, it would be a disservice to teacher Hua for making this trip in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>He tilted his head back, unccorked the bottle, and drank the pale golden liquid in one gulp. There was no strange taste. Instead, a warm current flowed down my throat and into my lower abdomen, followed by an indescribable sensation that swept through my entire body. It really works. Akasha Shinuan threw the empty bottle onto the carpet.</p>
<p>Since teacher Hua assigned homework, we have to exceed the quota. The bedroom door slammed shut. Umbrella Corporation headquarters. This place has completely changed. The once somber fortress is now covered by countless sophisticated mechanical arms and energy shields flashing blue light, exuding a cyberpunk sci-fi feel.</p>
<p>300 m underground, the core laboratory on a huge holographic projection platform, a complex architectural diagram that makes people dizzy is slowly rotating. That was a strategic level blueprint that Shun Yuan had obtained from the system, the dragon blood tempering pool. At this moment, two women with completely different auras stood on either side of the projection table, the atmosphere tense and confrontational. The one on the left is Sue Chingu. She wore her signature white lab coat over a black turtleneck sweater that completely covered her exaggerated curves, making her appear even more aesthetic.</p>
<p>Her beautiful eyes behind the gold rimmed glasses were bloodshot, clearly from staying up for several nights in a row, but her energy was frighteningly high. No, absolutely not. Such Ching Zhu held an electronic pin in her hand and drew a heavy circle in a core area of the drawing, her voice sharp. The energy conduits here must be made of a superconducting alloy refined from stardust. Ordinary titanium alloys simply cannot withstand the energy impact of the eight realms candle dragons lifeblood.</p>
<p>If the conduit explodes, the entire company base will be raised to the ground. The person on the right is Muan Bing. She wore a sharp tailored silver gray suit. Her hair was neatly pinned up, her arms were crossed, and her delicate face was as cold as ice. Dr.</p>
<p>Sue, please understand that one gram of stardust costs 3 million, and it&#x27;s priceless. Muan Bing pointed to the long list of budgets next to her. Her tone is cold and hard as an emotionless financial machine. According to your plan, this conduit system alone will burn through 200 billion. Although Tianin Industries is rich, it doesn&#x27;t print money.</p>
<p>The current budget is already 300% over budget. If this continues, the company&#x27;s cash flow will dry up before the pool is even built. Money, money, money. All you ever think about is money. Such Ching Xu slammed her electronic pin on the table in anger, her chest heaving violently.</p>
<p>The astonishing curve of her chest made the male assistants next to her quickly lower their heads. Mu wing. Do you even know what a strategic level project is? If this pool is built, it can massproduce experts at the third or even fourth realm. At that time, it would be worth more than 200 billion, even two trillion. We need to have the money to build it first.</p>
<p>Muan Bing stood her ground, her phoenix eyes filled with the shrewdness and rationality of a businessman. I&#x27;m the CEO and I&#x27;m responsible to the company&#x27;s shareholders and Shin Yuan&#x27;s assets. The current solution, while sacrificing performance, is secure enough and cost-effective. It must be done my way. You&#x27;re committing a crime.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re wasting the dragon blood that the company guy brought back. I&#x27;m cutting my losses. I&#x27;m trying to save this damn project. The two were evenly matched, neither willing to concede to the other. Natasha and Lynn Char huddled in a corner, barely daring to breathe.</p>
<p>These are the two smartest women in the base arguing. When gods fight, mortals suffer. They dare not interrupt. Just as the two were arguing fiercely, and it looked like they were about to come to blows. Drop dash.</p>
<p>The laboratory&#x27;s main control screen suddenly lit up with a red light. A highly encrypted communication request abruptly ended all the arguments. There was no image on the screen, only a simple file transfer progress bar. Sender Shinuan. Um, Su Ching Xu and Mu Waning stopped arguing at the same time and turned their eyes to the screen.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this bastard preparing for the finals in the capital? What is he sending me now? Su Ching Xu muttered, but her hands didn&#x27;t slow down, and she immediately clicked to receive the message. Buzz. As the files were unzipped, two brand new holographic drawings instantly filled the entire laboratory space. The first item was a grotesque humanoid machine covered in black and red armor. Unlike those bulky traditional matchs, it is more like a sophisticated exoskeleton suit with a dense array of energy circuits hidden beneath its streamlined armor plates and even a pair of folding light wings on its back.</p>
<p>Next to the drawing, a line of large eye-catching text was marked. Guardian type one individual exoskeleton battle armor. Energy core miniature cold fusion battery formula attached. Armor material nanofluid alloy. Weapon system.</p>
<p>Highfrequency vibrating particle knife. Plus, shoulder-fired miniature tracking missile. Expected increase in combat power. Allows ordinary soldiers to possess strength and defense comparable to a third realm martial artist. Moderate mass production cost.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 75. Two girlfriends shake hands. Akasha finally has good luck. Alloy fiber. No, this thing is alive.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu stared intently at the blueprints for Guardian Type 1, her fingers gesturing wildly in the air as if she wanted to dismantle the Mecca through the screen. The exoskeleton&#x27;s connection points utilize bionic neuron technology, meaning it eliminates the need for cumbersome button operations. A wearer&#x27;s thought, or even a subconscious muscle twitch, can be perfectly captured and amplified a 100fold by the Mecca. This is a perfect fusion of human reaction, speed, and mechanical destructive power. Such Ching Zu became increasingly frantic as she watched, completely abandoning her aloof scientist persona.</p>
<p>She was practically glued to the control panel, her nose practically piercing the holographic projection and this miniature cold fusion battery. When her gaze fell upon the blueprints for the energy core, her breath caught in her throat, followed by a scream loud enough to shatter glass. Holy crap, how is this possible? Controlled nuclear fusion at room temperature, and the reactor has been shrunk to the size of a palm. This is a miracle that breaks down the barriers of physics. With this thing, let alone powering an exoskeleton, it would be more than enough to supply the entire power supply of Donghai City.</p>
<p>Compared to Su Chingu&#x27;s passion for technology, Muan Bing, standing on the other side, had a completely different focus. Her Phoenix eyes, which had seen countless contracts worth hundreds of billions, were also fixed on the mass production cost analysis table for the cold nuclear fusion battery. Those strings of numbers that she had previously found dull and boring now seemed to transform into a flurry of banknotes beckoning to her. The cost is only onetenth that of traditional crystal energy. Mu wanings hands trembled slightly.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t even maintain her icy CEO demeanor and grabbed the edge of the control panel. Clean, efficient, with unlimited battery life and low cost. Once this product hits the market, the entire empire&#x27;s energy landscape will be completely overturned. All the oil giants and crystal miners will have to kneel and speak before God industries. This isn&#x27;t a battery.</p>
<p>This is a money printing machine. A direct route to the world&#x27;s richest person. Muan Bing suddenly turned her head and looked at Su Chingu. Coincidentally, Su Chingu also looked up at her at that moment. Their eyes met in midair.</p>
<p>The tension from before was gone, as was the mutual dislike and disdain. It&#x27;s a tacit understanding, a collaboration, no, a powerful alliance that only intelligent people can comprehend. Dr. Su Muan Bing spoke first, her voice trembling slightly with excitement. Yet, she tried her best to maintain the composure of a businesswoman regarding the budget for that dragon blood tempering pool.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not important. Such Ching Zu waved her hand confidently, exclaiming, &quot;With this battery technology, we can save a huge amount of money on energy infrastructure. Moreover,&quot; she pushed up her gold rimmed glasses, which had slipped down to the tip of her nose, her eyes gleaming with a sharp light. &quot;As long as you can provide enough production lines and raw materials, I am confident that I can produce a prototype of this exoskeleton armor within a week.&quot; A week? Muan Bing raised an eyebrow, a confident smile curving her lips. Tion Shun Industrial has three superlar intelligent manufacturing plants in Dongghai with 20,000 high precision robotic arms.</p>
<p>As long as the blueprints are fine and the funds are sufficient, it will take half a month. I&#x27;ll ramp up the production line for you. The first batch of 100 sets of combat armor, I want them to be at the forefront of the East China Sea Defense Line. Make a deal. Such excitedly reached out her hand.</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, Muan Bing firmly grasped it with her well-maintained jade-like hand. &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure to work with you for the company.&quot; Su Ching Zhu shouted a slogan for profit. Muan being added honestly. In the corner, Natasha and Lin Char who had been hunched over like quailes were dumbfounded by what they saw. They were arguing so fiercely they were practically tearing the roof off.</p>
<p>But after receiving a document and glancing at the blueprints, they&#x27;re already dating. Is this the world of capitalists and mad scientists? Lynch blinked her big eyes, looking completely bewildered. Her expression changed faster than turning the pages of a book. Natasha looked thoughtfully at the document on the screen signed by Shin Yuan, a hint of admiration flashing in her eyes. No, it&#x27;s because the master is too amazing.</p>
<p>He was like a magician. He could just throw something out and make those two arrogant women obedient. Three days passed in the blink of an eye. But for the entire Lshia Empire, those three days felt like an eternity. The suspension of the Battle of the Prodigies has not cooled down the hype at all.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it&#x27;s like adding fuel to the fire in a pressure cooker. The video of Shin Yuan causing a miracle in the second round and stunning all the contestants has been widely circulated online with the number of views already exceeding 100 billion. Countless people are speculating about how much strength that man who was once ridiculed as an F-rank waste actually possesses. As the center of the storm, Shinuan had a very fulfilling 3 days. Ling Yun Pavilion Villa in the capital city.</p>
<p>The master bedroom door remained closed for 3 days and three nights. Apart from the occasional food delivery robot that goes in to deliver high energy nutrient solutions and top quality ingredients, no one goes in or out. Even Huan Nongying, a top tier mentor who was eager to take on apprentices, didn&#x27;t dare to bother him again after Shun Yuan tricked her away on the first night by saying he needed to adjust his state and prepare for the finals. After all, there are some things that everyone understands, but doesn&#x27;t say a word about. Shin Yuan leaned against the headboard, his bare upper body covered in fine beads of sweat, his well-defined muscles looking as perfect as an ancient Greek sculpture in the morning light.</p>
<p>Lord of the Dragon Akasha let out a dreamlike murmur. In the past three days, in order to complete the assignment given by Huan Nongying and to completely defeat this SS level great fairy, he has used all his skills. The powerful physique of the S-rank undying dragon blood combined with the frank unfailing luck talent. They managed to take this countest, a sixthrem marshall king, from an evenly matched contest to a complete route. In my mind, the long lost heavenly system notification sound finally exploded.</p>
<p>Ding. Congratulations, host. Target Akasha has been successfully acquired. Good luck. Ding.</p>
<p>Detected SS level blood queen bloodline. Sixth realm marshall king physique. Calculating rewards. It&#x27;s here. Shin Yuan&#x27;s hand holding the cigarette trembled slightly, and his eyes burst with ecstatic light.</p>
<p>Rewards settled. Personal reward one. Gain 1/5if of the targets maximum health. Health plus 300,000. Personal reward two.</p>
<p>Gain a portion of the targets innate ability. Blood control advanced. Allows manipulation of one&#x27;s own and enemies blood for attack or healing. Clan rewards. Tier 6, tier 7, and tier 8 HP enhancement potion recipes have been unlocked.</p>
<p>Guardian type one mech core blueprints have been unlocked. 300,000 units ofqi and blood. His currentq chi and blood value is 480,000 which is at the critical point between the peak of the fourth realm and the fifth realm. That 300,000 was spent. Boom dash.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no need for him to take the initiative to guide them. That enormous energy which appeared out of nowhere poured into his limbs and bones. The meridians that had already reached their bottleneck were forcibly widened once again under the impact of this force. Every cell in the body is cheering, dividing, and reorganizing. The golden dragon shadow in the blood became increasingly solid, emitting deep dragon roars.</p>
<p>Ding, your chi and blood value has exceeded 500,000. Congratulations, host. You have successfully advanced to the fifth realm Grandmaster early stage. Ding, your chi and blood value has exceeded 600,000. Your realm is now stable.</p>
<p>Ding! YourQi in blood value has exceeded 700,000. Congratulations, host. You have successfully advanced to the fifth realm Grandmaster mid-stage. Final Shinyuan&#x27;s health and vitality value remains steadily at the terrifying number of 780,000, the middle stage of the five realms. Moreover, he is a mid-stage fifth realm cultivator with an incredibly solid foundation and the blessing of S-level dragon blood.</p>
<p>Shinuan clenched his fist. The air was crushed in his palm with a crisp sound. If he used to have to rely on his physical strength to fight against the five realm star beasts, then now he only needs to move his fingers to crush that vajra demon ape to the ground. Call. Shun yuan exhaled a long breath of turbid air which condensed and did not dissipate, turning into a white ribbon that lingered in the air for a long time.</p>
<p>He glanced down at Akasha who was still asleep, a hint of tenderness flashing in his eyes. This woman is truly a treasure trove. Not only is she extremely beautiful, but her ability to bring good fortune to her husband is also unparalleled. Chapter 176. The Empress of the Empire makes her debut.</p>
<p>Shinuan also wants to keep a low profile. Don&#x27;t worry. Shin Yuan reached out and tucked the blanket around her, speaking softly. Now that you&#x27;re my woman, I&#x27;ll hold up the sky for you no matter what happens. He rolled out of bed, walked barefoot to the French windows, and pulled back the curtains.</p>
<p>The blinding sunlight instantly flooded the entire room. Shinuan narrowed his eyes and looked at the dragon nest arena in the distance, which lay like a giant beast in the center of the city. The final match is about to begin there today. Five realms middle stage. Shinyuan twisted his neck and his joints cracked like popping beans.</p>
<p>A smug, arrogant smile appeared on his face. This wave is nothing to boast about, let alone any prodigies. Even if those two male instructors from the domain academy who don&#x27;t like me personally come down, I can still beat the crap out of them. Pressure? Not at all. Dragon&#x27;s Nest Arena.</p>
<p>3 days later, this magnificent building, which can hold 100,000 people, was once again submerged by a surging crowd. Compared to the opening ceremony 3 days ago, the atmosphere today was even more frenzied to the point of being somewhat out of control. Besides the martial arts enthusiasts who came to see the duel between the prodigies, tens of thousands of enthusiastic fans with glow sticks, lightboards, and stickers on their faces also flooded the venue. They have only one goal. The legendary diva who will be performing at the opening of today&#x27;s finals.</p>
<p>Muching muing muinga. Goddess Chinga, I love you. The cheers rose like a tsunami, one wave higher than the next, even drowning out the rousing battle anthem that was originally playing. In midair, Su Xiao Yao, who was supposed to be the focus of everyone&#x27;s attention, was hovering in the corner with a depressed expression. Her pink wings flapped weakly, and the microphone in her hand was almost deformed from being squeezed.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s so great about it? Looking at the group of crazy fans below, Su Xiao muttered sourly. So, what if she sings a little better and has slightly longer legs? These fickle people. Just a few days ago, they were calling me little sweetie, and now they&#x27;re all calling that woman goddess. Even though Su Xiao Yao was unconvinced, she had to admit it. Muching is absolutely dazzling today as a ethereal and dreamlike melody began to play.</p>
<p>The stage in the center of the arena slowly rose. There were no backup dancers or fancy light shows. Only one spotlight shown on the beautiful figure standing quietly in the center of the stage. She wore a long flowing silver white dress, the hem of which spread out like mercury at her feet, shimmering with a dreamlike glow as she moved. This dress is not a traditional feminine style, but incorporates a metallic armor design at the shoulders and waist, which retains the femininity while adding a touch of Valkyy&#x27;s heroic spirit.</p>
<p>That aloof and otherworldly face was stunningly beautiful under the lights. She didn&#x27;t laugh. Just by standing there quietly, his innate nobility and aloofness instantly silenced the entire audience of 100,000 people. This is the true national goddess. This is the woman who truly stands at the top of the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Muing Shua raised the microphone, her eyes as bright as stars slowly sweeping across the entire room. She is looking for someone. Find that scoundrel who once grinned wickedly at a banquet and told her he would marry her once he became famous throughout the empire. Find a man who three days ago single-handedly shattered the entire scene with his doineering arrogance. My gaze swept across the player&#x27;s seats.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t see it. The spot that belonged to Shin Yuan was now empty. A hint of disappointment flashed in Muing Shuas eyes, but it was quickly replaced by determination. Her red lips parted slightly. The singing flowed out like heavenly music.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t one of her popular love songs, but a stirring and powerful one. The battle song. The wind rises, the clouds fly. Where can I find brave warriors to guard the four corners of the land? Her voice was incredibly penetrating. Every note seemed to strike deep into the souls of everyone present, instantly igniting the passion within them.</p>
<p>The song ended. The entire venue erupted in cheers. Countless people shouted her name at the top of their lungs and quite a few excited fans even fainted on the spot. Mu Ching Shua stood in the center of the stage, microphone in hand. For the first time, her usually cool eyes were tinged with shyness, but more so with a resolute determination to go allin.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone. Her voice carried throughout the venue through the speakers yet remained exceptionally clear. Today I stand here not just as a singer. More importantly, she is a woman waiting to fulfill a promise. The entire room fell silent instantly and gossip radars seemed to stand on end above everyone&#x27;s heads.</p>
<p>A promise? A woman? Is the diva about to make an official announcement? A blush rose on Mu Ching Shua&#x27;s cheeks, but her voice rose a few decibels. Someone once told me that when he won the championship of the heavenly pride tournament and became famous throughout the empire, that would be the day he came to marry me. At the time, I agreed. Wa! This news is even more explosive than Shan Yuan&#x27;s shockwave that shattered the entire venue. The Empress of the Empire, the dream girl of countless men.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s already taken. And she&#x27;s going to marry the champion of this year&#x27;s heavenly pride battle. What? Who? Which bastard stole my wife? The champion. Doesn&#x27;t that mean Long Shiao and Xiao Hongi both have a chance?  Have you all forgotten who&#x27;s number one on the leaderboard? It&#x27;s Shinuan. Shinyuan.</p>
<p>That scumbag again. He already has so many women and he still comes to ruin our goddess Ching Shua. No, I won&#x27;t accept it. I want to go on stage and duel with Shin Yuan. The scene was filled with wailing and howling, and the sound of countless young men&#x27;s hearts breaking echoed throughout the room.</p>
<p>On the player&#x27;s bench, Long Sha, who had just come out of the hospital and was still a little pale, suddenly brightened up in his previously dim eyes upon hearing these words. Shinuan. Long Sha clenched his fist, his eyes burning with the flames of revenge. I admit you are strong and your mental power is even more bizarre. But this final is a real ring battle.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t believe you can be invincible with your physical body. Not far away, Chinu looked at the radiant woman on the stage, a complex emotion flashing in her cool eyes. Has even she fallen for it? Chinu remembered the man with the indifferent expression before the illusion shattered. Scumbag,&quot; she muttered a curse under her breath. But the inexplicable irritation in her heart grew stronger and stronger just as the entire venue was in chaos due to Mu Ching Shu&#x27;s official announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumble.&quot; A low rumble of thunder suddenly echoed above the arena. The voice sounds familiar. Everyone instinctively looked up. A familiar jet black heavy fighter jet, like a giant beast crawling out of the abyss, forcefully pushed through the clouds and hovered directly above the dragon&#x27;s nest. The hatch opened.</p>
<p>There was no red carpet, no flowers. Only one figure leaped down from a height of a thousand m. Bang! A loud bang! The figure crashed heavily onto the speciallymade alloy arena in the center of the arena like a meteorite falling to earth. Smoke and dust rose and gravel flew everywhere. When the smoke and dust cleared, a man wearing a black fitted trench coat with his hands in his pockets and a lollipop in his mouth appeared before everyone.</p>
<p>He looked somewhat languid, even a little sleepy, but the aura emanating from him. It is no longer the peak of the fourth realm. Instead, it was an aura as heavy as a mountain and as deep as the sea, making all the fifth realm experts present feel breathless. Fifth realm Grandmaster. Moreover, it&#x27;s at the mid-stage of the fifth realm.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan spat out the candy stick in his mouth, raised his head, and his dark eyes looked over the crowd, landing precisely on the silver white figure on the stage. He grinned, revealing a set of bright white teeth. That smile was arrogant, confident, and carried a roguish air that made people grit their teeth in hatred. &quot;Sorry everyone, I was so engrossed in studying last night that I overslept.&quot; Shinyuan waved at Muing Shua as if greeting a girl next door. That daughter-in-law sings quite well.</p>
<p>Now that the dowry has been prepared, so this champion Shiny Yuan turned around, his gaze sweeping across the entire scene before finally settling on the ashenfaced prodigies. He extended a finger and gently hooked it. You came one by one to deliver them. Should we attack together? Chapter 177. The arrogant dragon lord.</p>
<p>The privilege of the first place. Shin Yuans words, &quot;Let&#x27;s go together. Were like a depth charge thrown into a cesspool.&quot; Instead of creating a splash, they stirred up a suffocating, foul silence. Nobody moved. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m scared, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m speechless at this kid&#x27;s shamelessness.</p>
<p>Sitting in the first row of the contestant seats, Long Sha was simply adjusting the cuffs of his purple gold python robe. His eyes, which gleamed with purple light, revealed a kind of contempt for him as he looked at a clown. Xiao Hongi did react. Her hand, adorned with a red alloy wrist guard, gripped the black and gold spear at her side tightly, causing the shaft to hum, but she just snorted and turned her head to the side, clearly disdaining to engage in a group fight at this time, as that would be an insult to her reputation as a female gunslinger. As for Chinua, this icy beauty still maintained an unapproachable demeanor.</p>
<p>Only she withdrew her gaze from the stage and closed her eyes to rest again. As if the man who had just descended from the sky had never existed. Oh, what? Have you all gone mute? Shinyuan wasn&#x27;t embarrassed that no one was paying attention to him. He reached out and scratched his black hair, which was somewhat disheveled by the strong winds at high altitude. With his other hand, he naturally pulled a lollipop from his trench coat pocket, unwrapped it, and popped it into his mouth.</p>
<p>His cheeks bulged out, making him look somewhat comical, yet exuding an indescribable sense of relaxation. Weren&#x27;t you all so capable just now? Now you&#x27;re trying to tear my mouth apart and spear me. While chewing on candy, Shin Yuan strolled along the edge of the arena with an air of nonchilence. When he passed in front of L Shao, he deliberately stopped and bent down, his handsome face almost touching Liaos nose. Especially you, your highness.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan smiled and pointed to the purplish red scar between Liaos eyebrows that had not yet fully healed. It was cracked 3 days ago in the illusion. Your injury hasn&#x27;t fully healed yet. Do you want me to introduce you to a plastic surgeon? I know a veterinarian who&#x27;s incredibly skilled. He doesn&#x27;t even need anesthesia for stitches.</p>
<p>on the back of Long Xiaos hand, which was gripping the armrest. The veins bulged and his knuckles turned white, but he managed to hold back. This is the final match being broadcast live across the entire empire, washed by billions of eyes. He represents the face of the royal long family. If he were to lose his composure at this moment due to the words of this rogue, he would truly become a laughingstock.</p>
<p>Shinyuan Liaos voice was so calm, it sounded like he was reciting a eulogy. Keep that mouth of yours, and when I get on stage later, I&#x27;ll smash it inch by inch. That&#x27;s scary. Shin Yuan patted his chest dramatically and turned to look at the pink-haired Lowly in midair who was completely dumbfounded. Host Su, is this competition still going to happen? My whole family is waiting for me to win the championship and have a feast when I get back.</p>
<p>Can you please hurry up? Su Xiao Yao was hovering in midair, her pink wings flapping somewhat stiffly. She looked down at the arrogant Shun Yuan, then at the top geniuses around her whose faces were as black as the bottom of a pot, and felt utterly miserable. Hosting this year&#x27;s Tenja battle was a complete disaster for my career. Cough, cough. Su Xiao Yao cleared her throat, raised the microphone again, and forced a professional fake smile onto her cute little face.</p>
<p>Shinuan, please watch your words and attitude. Su Xiao flew lower, trying to appear more dignified. But her long legs and tight-fitting crop top only diminished her perceived authority. Although your entrance is quite unique, this is a proper martial arts arena with rules. She stretched out a slender white finger and waved it in the air.</p>
<p>According to the competition rules, the final stage adopts a onevone elimination system, and any form of group fighting or private combat is strictly prohibited. Therefore, your request to fight 10 people at once is rejected. A chorus of booze erupted from the audience. Sha, that&#x27;s boring. Let him hit him.</p>
<p>Let him hit him. I just want to see this scumbag get ganged up on. Su Xiao, don&#x27;t stop him. He&#x27;s asking for it. Su Xia Yao ignored the jeering voices, changed the subject, and that mischievous smile reappeared on her face.</p>
<p>However, she deliberately drew out the last syllable, and her big eyes darted around Shin Yuan. Given Shen Yuan&#x27;s outstanding performance in the second stage, Deep Blue Nightmare, where he achieved a commanding lead in points and broke historical records. Therefore, with the special approval of the organizing committee, &quot;You have a special right, the king&#x27;s privilege. The king&#x27;s privilege.&quot; Shinyuan raised an eyebrow, took the lollipop out of his mouth, and thought, &quot;That sounds pretty cringe-worthy. What can it actually do? Can it just give me a trophy? Dream on.&quot; Su Xiaoa rolled her eyes at him.</p>
<p>The contents of this privilege are in the first three rounds of the finals as the leader in the points ranking, you have absolute priority in choosing. In other words, Su Xiao Yao pointed to the remaining 99 prodigies in the contestant seat. You can freely choose any player as your opponent regardless of their ranking or whether they want to accept your challenge. They must do so. At this point, Su Xiaoa smile became somewhat meaningful.</p>
<p>Even if you deliberately choose a weakling who&#x27;s ranked last and barely made it to the early stages of the fourth realm to bully others in order to conserve your strength, the rules still allow it. Wo! The entire audience erupted in uproar. This privilege is outrageous. It&#x27;s important to know that the worst thing in martial arts competitions is a series of matches or encountering an opponent who has a counter to your strengths. With this privilege, Shin Yuan could completely avoid the favorites to win the championship such as Long Shiao, Xiao Hongi, and Shin Shua, and instead pick on the weaker opponents, thus securing his place in the top four.</p>
<p>This is unfair. This is a cover up. Why can he just pick anyone he wants? Exactly. If he keeps picking on the weaker opponents, what&#x27;s the point of the competition? Some people in the audience were unhappy, especially the gamblers who had bet on Liao or Xiao Hongi to win. They were the loudest.</p>
<p>But Shin Yuan was amused. Oh, is there such a good thing? He fiddled with the candy stick in his hand, his gaze sweeping across the player&#x27;s seats. That look didn&#x27;t seem like he was looking at an opponent at all. It was more like he was picking out cabbages at the market. The kind of picky look where you have to peel back the leaves to see if there&#x27;s any rotten inside.</p>
<p>Those ranked lower who were swept by his gaze turned pale with fright, wishing they could hide their heads in their crotches. If you were chosen by this monster that could kill a peak fifthrem demonic ape with a single strike, wouldn&#x27;t you be beaten to a pulp? Stop hiding. It&#x27;s the one in the green shirt. Shinuan suddenly pointed to a thin young man in the corner who was trying to hide behind a chair. The young man shuddered and almost burst into tears on the spot.</p>
<p>Brother, I have an 80-year-old mother to support and children to raise. All right. All right. Look at you, you coward. You probably peed your pants, didn&#x27;t you? Shinuan waved his hand dismissively and looked away.</p>
<p>He then looked at a large man in heavy armor next to him. Your tenkin looks pretty tough, but it&#x27;s too bulky and doesn&#x27;t feel good to use. Pass. Shinuan simply walked around the contestants area with his hands behind his back. The way they treated all the geniuses in the audience like monkeys made Long Shiao and the others expressions grow increasingly ugly.</p>
<p>Shinuan, are you going to fight or not? Xiao Hongi finally couldn&#x27;t hold back any longer. She stood up abruptly, her red armor clanging loudly. If you&#x27;re too scared to choose the stronger option, then get out of here. Don&#x27;t waste everyone&#x27;s time. What&#x27;s the rush? Shiny Yuan stopped and turned around to look at the female gunslinger with an angry expression.</p>
<p>He looked Xiao Hongi up and down, his gaze lingering for two seconds on the astonishing curves accentuated by her tight-fitting armor, a roguish smile playing on his lips. Beautiful lady in red, I know you want me to choose you. After all, being targeted by a tough guy like me is a kind of honor. But Shin Yuan shook his finger. For the first round today, I really can&#x27;t choose you.</p>
<p>Why? Ziao Hongi asked instinctively, then realized she&#x27;d been led astray, her face darkening. Who asked you to choose? Because Shin Yuans smile suddenly vanished. He turned away and stopped looking at anyone. Instead, he walked straight to the purple robed youth who was sitting upright in the center of the first row, exuding an aura of imperial power. The distance was less than half a meter.</p>
<p>Shinuan looked down at Long Sha. The languidness in those dark eyes vanished, replaced by a ferocity and wildness akin to the awakening of an ancient beast. Someone owes me something, and I need to get it back first. Shiny Yuan stretched out a hand, palm up, and placed it under Liaos nose. Hey, driver.</p>
<p>That day on the red carpet, I said that your car was blocking my way. As I said before, it&#x27;s not certain who that car will belong to. The entire room fell silent. Everyone held their breath. He wants to choose Long Sha, picking the strongest in the first match.</p>
<p>Is this kid crazy or just too confident? Long Sha slowly raised his head, and in his purple pupils, two tiny dragon-shaped phantoms were frantically moving around. He smiled. His laughter was extremely cruel and extremely excited. Good. Long Shao slowly stood up, his purple gold python robe fluttering without wind, and a terrifying wave of energy erupted from him.</p>
<p>Shinuan, I&#x27;m giving you this chance. It not only distinguishes between superior and inferior, but also determines life and death. Want my golden chariot? Long Shia took out a long sword with an ancient design and a purple gold light flowing through it from his storage ring, the tip of which was pointed directly at Shun Yuan&#x27;s throat. Then you&#x27;ll have to trade your life for it. Chapter 178.</p>
<p>Military pathkilling fist. Your highness, are you feeling weak? What am I supposed to do here? These words were like a resounding slap in the face. Making Long Xiao&#x27;s headbust. He, the dignified crown prince of the empire, possessing the bloodline of a true dragon and a peerless genius at the peak of the fifth realm, was reduced to a worthless beast in the mouth of this scoundrel. Court death.</p>
<p>Long Shao could no longer maintain his aloof noble demeanor, and the purple lightning divine sword in his hand emitted a sharp crack. Without any fancy opening moves, the sword light flashed like purple lightning, piercing straight for Shun Yuan&#x27;s throat. That sword strike was too fast. It was so fast that the air was torn apart by a shrill scream, and the audience below the stage only saw a purple after image. Wow, so fast.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongs pupils shrank sharply. If it were her, she would have no time to dodge this sword unless she could withstand it head-on. Shinyuan did not dodge. He didn&#x27;t even take his left hand out of his pocket. Just as the sword tip was about to pierce his Adam&#x27;s apple, his right hand, which was still holding a lollipop stick, suddenly shot out.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t a block, nor was it a dodge. Instead, they grabbed it head-on. Military style I steel body. Shin Yuan gave a low shout in his heart, and the Yuan chi within his body, tempered by s-level dragon blood, was instantly compressed and covered his palm. His originally fair skin instantly shone with a layer of dark golden metallic luster.</p>
<p>Clang dash. The collision between flesh and blood, and the royal divine weapon produced a resounding metallic clang. Sparks flew everywhere. Shin Yuans dark golden hand gripped the blade of Z Dian tightly. And no matter how rampant the purple sword energy was, it couldn&#x27;t even cut through his skin.</p>
<p>What? Long Sha was shocked. This is a divine weapon forged with meteorite iron capable of cutting through iron like mud. Even a sixthrem marshall king with protective chi wouldn&#x27;t dare to take it head-on. Yet this kid actually caught the blade with his bare hands. Too weak.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t you eat? Shinyuan grinned, revealing a set of gleaming white teeth. The next second, he suddenly flipped his wrist and a tremendous force burst forth from the sword. Let go. Long Sha felt an irresistible force strike him. His tiger&#x27;s mouth was in excruciating pain and he was pulled off balance, staggering forward.</p>
<p>Great opportunity. A glint flashed in Shun Yuans eyes, and his right leg, like a whip, lashed out with a deafening roar as it tore through the air, striking hard at Longho&#x27;s waist and abdomen. Military style two, storm kick. Boom! A white blade of energy burst forth from his leg. Long Sha was, after all, a top genius who had experienced countless battles.</p>
<p>In the critical moment, he forcibly twisted his waist, clenched his left fist, surrounded by purple energy, and forcefully slammed it towards that energy blade. Bang! The shock wave exploded, and the two of them were forced back simultaneously. Shinuan took three steps back to steady himself, shook his slightly numb hands, and looked relaxed and carefree. Long Sha took five steps back. Although he was not injured, his once neat purple gold python robe was cut open by the air blade, making him look somewhat disheveled.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s interesting. Shin Yuan spat out the candy stick from his mouth, twisted his neck, and his joints cracked all over. I originally thought you were just a rich kid who only knew how to drive luxury cars and pick up girls, but I didn&#x27;t expect you to have some skills. These five military techniques were taught to me by Ling, so using them to fight you is a perfect match. Shin Yuan assumed a fighting stance, a perfectly standard military combat style characterized by its wide, sweeping, and fierce movements.</p>
<p>Again, before he finished speaking, Shinuan&#x27;s figure had already disappeared from the spot. Two large craters were blown open in the ground. He was like a humanoid Tyrannosaurus Rex, crashing directly into Liaos arms, fist, elbow, knee, shoulder. Shin Yuan turned every part of his body into a deadly weapon. His attacks were like a storm.</p>
<p>Each punch heavier than the last. Each kick faster than the last. There are no fancy special effects, only the purest collision of power and speed. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. The dull thuds of flesh colliding on the ring were as dense as drum beats.</p>
<p>Long Sha was stunned by the beating. He received the highest level of royal martial arts education from a young age, which emphasizes exquisite moves and controlling the sword with chi. Where had he ever seen such a reckless street fighting style? Shinyuan never plays by the rules. One second he&#x27;s performing a proper military boxing routine and the next he might unleash a vicious groin kick or gouge out an eye and lock his throat. But this kid&#x27;s body was ridiculously tough.</p>
<p>Long Xiao sword energy could only leave a white mark on him. While when Shin Yuan&#x27;s fist came down, Long Sha felt his bones groaning. Damn it. Damn it. Are you a turtle? Your skin is so thick.</p>
<p>Long Sha struggled to defend himself while roaring angrily. That&#x27;s what you call a tough guy. Don&#x27;t you understand? Shin Yuan headbutted L Sha hard on the forehead, making both of them see stars. A delicate, affeminite guy like you certainly wouldn&#x27;t understand what male romance is. Damn it.</p>
<p>Long Sha was completely enraged. To be beaten and insulted as a in front of billions of people is an utter disgrace. Get out of here. Long Sha let out a roar. And the power that had been dormant within him for a long time suddenly erupted.</p>
<p>Boom dash. A purple shockwave exploded outwards from him, forcefully sending Shin Yuan, who was locked in close combat, flying away. Long Shao had disheveled hair and bloodshot eyes. The wound that had split between his eyebrows had miraculously healed, revealing a third eye that was opened vertically and radiating an eerie purple light. Purple demon eye.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the void behind him, a purple dragon phantom, hundreds of feet long, slowly emerged, circling and roaring, exuding a suffocating imperial aura. Shinuan, you have completely enraged me. Liaos voice became overlapping and ethereal, as if it did not come from a human being, but from the roar of that giant dragon. I was originally going to play along with you, but since you&#x27;re courting death, I&#x27;ll show you what true royal heritage is all about. Purple demon eye soulstealing buzz.</p>
<p>A beam of purple light almost tangible shot out from the vertical eye between Long Xiao&#x27;s eyebrows, ignoring the distance in space and instantly entering Shun Yuan&#x27;s eyes. This is a psychological attack. It strikes right at the soul. Even a peak level mental ability user would have their soul frozen instantly under the gaze of the purple demon eye, turning them into a helpless idiot. The hearts of the entire audience jumped into their throats.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s a psychological attack. That&#x27;s too underhanded. Long Sha just demonstrated the power of this eye technique in the illusion. Even if Shun Yuan&#x27;s physical body is strong, his mental strength is still a weakness, right? He&#x27;s going to be in trouble this time.</p>
<p>At the edge of the stage, Muing Shua gripped her skirt tightly, her knuckles turning white, her beautiful eyes filled with worry, and she almost rushed onto the stage. However, a second passed. 2 seconds passed. Shiny Yuan, who was struck by the purple light, did not collapse and convulse as everyone expected, nor did he show any signs of pain. He just stood there and blinked.</p>
<p>She blinked again. Then he raised his hand and rubbed his eyes, looking somewhat puzzled. That&#x27;s it. Shiny Yuan looked at Long Sha, who was staring at him with a ferocious expression, waiting to see him turn into an idiot, and a look of extremely irritating confusion appeared on his face. Your Highness, is this ultimate movement for people&#x27;s vision correction? The purple light that shown in just now felt warm and comfortable, and my pseudommyopia seems to have improved quite a bit.</p>
<p>Impossible. Long Xiaos eyes nearly popped out of their sockets, and the vertical eye between his brows trembled violently. This is the full force attack of the purple demon eye, enough to instantly destroy the mind of a fifth realm expert. How could this kid be completely unharmed? Could it be that an absurd thought had arisen in Longhas mind? His mental strength is several times stronger than mine. No, absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Shinuan was of course unharmed. Just kidding. He&#x27;s even withstood the gaze of the bronze giant gate. So this purple light is no different from a flashlight shining in his eyes. Chapter 179.</p>
<p>Two pats on the shoulder. And the dragon wants to kneel. I said, &quot;Your highness.&quot; Shiny Yuan crossed his arms and looked at Longho&#x27;s still glowing third eye with a mocking expression. Your eyes are quite unique. They look like Earling shuns.</p>
<p>However, I&#x27;ve heard that these kinds of X-ray vision and soul capturing eyes are usually used for evil deeds. Shiny Yuan lowered his voice, speaking in a whisper that could be heard by everyone. Confess. Honestly, when you were in the palace, did you often use this thing to peep at the palace maids taking a bath? I can see that your eyes are dark and your steps are unsteady. You were out of breath after only a few moves.</p>
<p>These are obvious signs of kidney deficiency. Tsk tsk tsk. Young people need to be more restrained. If this gets out, you&#x27;ll completely disgrace the royal family. Puff dash.</p>
<p>These words were 10,000 times more destructive than the punch just now. The entire audience of 100,000 people was instantly petrified. The chat in the live stream was filled with laughter. A master thief peaks at palace maids bathing. This is outrageous.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like humiliating the dragon prince&#x27;s dignity. However, Shin Yuans words seemed to make some sense. Long shouted appears somewhat weak just now. Shun Yuan. Long Sha was so angry that he trembled all over and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>He, the crown prince of the empire, a man of impeccable morals and devoted to martial arts, was actually slandered as a voyer. I&#x27;m going to kill you. I&#x27;m going to tear you to pieces. Imperial dragon aura. The true dragon descends.</p>
<p>Long Sha has completely lost his mind. He no longer held back any of his strength and even burned his primordial essence. Roar dash. The purple dragon phantom behind him solidified instantly after absorbing the essence blood as if it had truly come to life. The enormous dragon body coiled above the arena, blotting out the sun.</p>
<p>A terrifying pressure emanating from an ancient dragon swept across the entire area like a landslide and a tsunami. The protective shield around the arena creaked under the strain and the ground began to crack inch by inch. Many audience members near the front row were so overwhelmed by the pressure that they fell to the ground, unable to even lift their heads. Is this the true foundation of the royal long family? This is terrifying. It&#x27;s practically a god.</p>
<p>Shin yuan is finished. This is something that no human can contend with. Under the horrified gazes of everyone, Long Sha hovered in midair, merging with the giant purple dragon, looking down at Shun Yuan from above. His voice was as cold as a god, devoid of any emotion. Shinyuan, you have every reason to be proud that you forced me to use this move.</p>
<p>Kneel down now and accept your death. I might leave you a whole corpse. Faced with this earthshattering power, the player seats behind Shinuan. Akasha swirled her wine glass, gazing at the boisterous purple dragon in the sky. A disdainful sneer playing on her lips.</p>
<p>A real dragon, huh? How dare a purple mudfish with legs call itself a dragon in front of a dragon lord. Beside her, Ling held the broken sword. Although her face was pale from the pressure, her beautiful eyes were full of pride and determination. He had no idea what he was facing. lung.</p>
<p>You pushed up her glasses and a data stream flashed across the lenses. The energy peak is very high, but it&#x27;s very weak. Compared to the thing inside the master&#x27;s body, it&#x27;s like a firefly compared to the bright moon. The three women exchanged glances, each seeing the mockery in the others eyes. Long Sha, this real dragon, has kicked a hornet&#x27;s nest.</p>
<p>In the center of the arena, a fierce wind raged. Shin Yuan stood in the eye of the storm, his black trench coat fluttering wildly in the wind. his black hair dancing wildly. He looked up at the arrogant long shadow in the sky and the ferocious purple dragon. There was no fear nor panic.</p>
<p>Instead, he laughed. It was a smile of extreme excitement, extreme greed, and even a hint of gluttony. True dragon bloodline. Shinyuan licked his slightly chapped lips, and deep in his eyes, two golden flames suddenly ignited. Perfect timing.</p>
<p>I just broke through to the next level, and I&#x27;m a bit hungry. Boom. Dash. Without any warning, a terrifying aura, even more ancient, doineering, and noble than the Imperial Dragon aura, suddenly erupted from Shun Yuan&#x27;s seemingly frail body. If Longho&#x27;s aura was that of a high and mighty emperor, so the aura that Shin Yuan is unleashing at this moment is that of the primordial ancestral dragon, which created the world and devoured all things.</p>
<p>Roar dash. A deep, vast, and ancient dragons roar, seemingly from the primordial era, resounded within Shun Yuan&#x27;s body. Golden light. The dazzling golden light instantly pierced through the purple aura, filling the sky. A layer of fine, almost tangible golden dragon scales appeared on Shun Yuan&#x27;s skin.</p>
<p>His hands transformed into sharp claws. His body did not grow larger, but his towering aura forcefully lifted the purple dragon in the sky. Esgrade bloodline undying dragon blood full power activated. What is this? Long Sha who was in midair instantly shattered his cold expression revealing endless terror. The true dragon bloodline within his own body was trembling.</p>
<p>It was trembling with fear. It was wailing. It was as if he had encountered his ancestor, the source of his bloodline. The suppression from the depths of his genes made it difficult for him to even breathe. Impossible.</p>
<p>I possess the true dragon bloodline passed down through generations of royalty for thousands of years. How could there possibly be a dragon&#x27;s might more noble than mine? Long Sha roared, desperately channeling the power within his body in an attempt to maintain the form of the purple dragon, but it didn&#x27;t work. Under the golden light, the once majestic purple dragon seemed to melt and disintegrate rapidly like ice and snow encountering the scorching sun. In the end, it shrank into a ball, hiding behind Long Shia and trembling. It no longer resembled a real dragon at all.</p>
<p>It looks exactly like a startled purple loach. Get down here. Shinuan snorted coldly and stomped his right foot on the ground. Thump. The entire arena collapsed with a deafening roar.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t fly up, but instead walked step by step through the void as if stepping on invisible stairs towards Long Sha in midair. With each step he took, the golden light emanating from his body intensified. With each step he took, the purple aura around Long Sha weakened a little. Don&#x27;t come any closer. Long Sha panicked.</p>
<p>I panicked completely. He felt as if he were facing not a person, but a prehistoric behemoth awakening. The suffocating feeling of being locked on by a predator made his bones tremble. And he even had an urge to turn around and run away. Weren&#x27;t you so arrogant just now? Weren&#x27;t you going to make me kneel down and accept my death? Shinuan walked up to Long Shiao, less than a meter away.</p>
<p>His eyes, now completely transformed into golden vertical pupils, met Lh Xiaos deathly pale face. Now I&#x27;m here. Why don&#x27;t you just do it? Long Xiaos hand holding the purple lightning divine sword was trembling violently. The tip of the sword was pointed at Shun Yuan&#x27;s chest, but he couldn&#x27;t pierce it. No matter what he did, his body betrayed his will.</p>
<p>Under the terrifying pressure of the ancestral dragon, his muscles stiffened, his meridians were blocked, and he couldn&#x27;t even move a finger. Waist, Shinuan curled his lip in disdain. He stretched out his hand, his movements slow and deliberate. Smack. The first pat landed lightly on Long Xiao&#x27;s left shoulder.</p>
<p>This slap is for my wives who were scared by you. Boom. As the palm struck, Long Sha felt as if a mountain had been pressing down on his shoulder. Click. His left shoulder bone shattered instantly, his knees buckled, and he sank uncontrollably downwards.</p>
<p>Uh Long Sha let out a scream, cold sweat pouring down his forehead, but he still held on tightly, using the divine sword to prop himself up on the ground, refusing to kneel down. &quot;He is the crown prince. He can&#x27;t kneel. If they kneel, the royal family&#x27;s reputation will be completely ruined.&quot; &quot;Wow, your bones are pretty hard.&quot; Shinuan raised an eyebrow and a cruel smile curled at the corner of his mouth. Let&#x27;s do it one more time.</p>
<p>Smack. The second blow landed on Long Xiao&#x27;s right shoulder. This slap teaches you what it means to respect the elderly and care for the young and what it means for a good dog not to block the way. Boom. This time the force was even greater than before.</p>
<p>Long Xiaos protective inner energy shattered instantly. His right shoulder caved in and the divine sword in his hand clattered to the ground. His legs were trembling violently and his knees were less than an inch from the ground. The entire room fell silent. Everyone held their breath, staring wideeyed at this incredible scene.</p>
<p>The once arrogant and doineering crown prince of the Imperial Long family was now like a school boy who had made a mistake with Shin Yuan holding his shoulders, ready to kneel at any moment. Chapter 180. Standoff above the capital. Shinshin, you dare? Long Sha forced out a few words through gritted teeth, his eyes bloodshot, filled with resentment and pleading. I am the crown prince.</p>
<p>Crown Prince. Shinyuan smiled. In this world, only the strong deserve to stand. Your dragon is nothing but a worm in front of me. Since it&#x27;s an insect, it has to lie flat.</p>
<p>Snap. The third time. The slap didn&#x27;t land on his shoulder, but instead landed heavily on the top of Longhos head. It was as if a god had pressed down the head of a mortal. An overwhelming dragon&#x27;s might surged down from the top of Long Xiao&#x27;s head, instantly shattering his last line of psychological defense.</p>
<p>Thump, thump, thump. A deep, muffled bang echoed throughout the dragon&#x27;s nest and the entire empire through the on-site recording equipment. I knelt down. Long Sha, the crown prince of the Long family of the Empire, the previous champion, and a true dragon bloodline holder. Under the watchful eyes of everyone, he slammed his knees heavily to the ground, facing Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>He knelt down. This kneeling shattered the dignity of the royal family. This kneeling shattered the world views of countless people. This kneeling also ushered in a new era. Shiny Yuan withdrew his hand, looking down at Long Sha kneeling at his feet.</p>
<p>His face showed no surprise, only a calm indifference. He turned around facing the 100,000 audience members and the countless cameras with arms outstretched. It&#x27;s as if embracing the whole world. Who else? Those three words like thunderclaps resounded through the heavens. The entire room fell silent.</p>
<p>A full 5 seconds passed. Boom dash. The dragon&#x27;s nest has been destroyed. Countless people roared Shun Yuans name wildly. The sound waves seeming to lift the dome off the sky.</p>
<p>Shinyuan. Shinyuan. Shinuan, champion, champion. At this moment, he is the only king on the player&#x27;s bench. Akasha, her face flushed with excitement, jumped up, abandoning all decorum, and shouted at the stage, &quot;Dragon Lord, you are mighty.</p>
<p>I want to have your babies.&quot; A gentle smile, unlike anything she&#x27;d ever seen before, curved Ly Yings lips as she softly stroked her lower abdomen. &quot;Baby, do you see this is your dad?&quot; Following Su Ching Xus example, Lung Yu pushed up her glasses, her eyes behind the lenses sparkling with admiration, her fingers flying across the folder as she jotted down notes. Mid-stage of the fifth realm, with an invincible physical body and perfect bloodline suppression. Cheers erupted inside the dragon&#x27;s nest, but the sky outside changed color. In the very center of the capital, deep within the Forbidden City, the symbol of the pinnacle of imperial power, a terrifying aura that had been suppressed for a long time finally erupted like a dormant volcano.</p>
<p>You brat, how dare you? This loud shout delivered without any amplification resounded throughout every inch of the air above the capital. Immediately afterwards, a dazzling purple gold pillar of light shot into the sky from the direction of the Imperial City. Within the pillar of light, a gigantic energy palm spanning a 100 acres carrying the crushing might of an eighth realm marshall emperor slammed down on Shin Yuan on the Dragon Nest arena across half the capital. It got dark. The palm lines were clearly visible.</p>
<p>Each line resembling a rushing river flowing with destructive imperial laws. The head of the Long family, Long Out Yin, the nominal ruler of the empire, has made his move. The crown prince kneeling in public is a blatant disgrace to the long family. A humiliation that has been torn off and trampled upon. If he doesn&#x27;t take action, where will the dignity of the royal family be? On the arena, Shin Yuan had just finished enjoying the cheers of the crowd and was about to win the heart of the beauty when suddenly everything went dark.</p>
<p>He looked up at the enormous, overwhelming hand that was descending upon him, narrowed his eyes, and remained motionless. She even had the leisure to put her hands back in her pockets and blow on her bangs. That old man has no sense of marshall ethics. Just as the giant hand was less than a 100 meters from the dragon&#x27;s nest dome, the terrifying wind pressure shattered countless glass curtain walls. Splash! A crisp sound of water being poured suddenly rang out from the clouds.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t loud, but it strangely drowned out the deafening roar. Above the dragon&#x27;s nest, the half-dead suspended phantom of Elderqin suddenly solidified. The old man tilted the purple clay teapot in his hand slightly, and a stream of tea spilled out. The tea water swelled as soon as it left the pot, instantly transforming into a vast ocean that effortlessly cradled the giant purple gold hand. Water is soft yet resilient.</p>
<p>No matter how hard the giant hand exerted its strength or how loudly it roared, it could not press down even an inch. Chief Dragon, that&#x27;s enough. Old Sheen was still wearing a faded Jong Sean suit and cloth shoes. He didn&#x27;t even look directly at the direction of the capital city. He just lowered his head and blew on the foam in his cup.</p>
<p>In a fight between juniors, if you&#x27;re not as skilled, you should accept the loss. But for you, as an elder, to personally intervene and even launch a sneak attack, aren&#x27;t you afraid of becoming a laughingstock throughout the entire Federation? Shinj, get out of my way. Above the Imperial City, a middle-aged man dressed in a golden robe with nine dragons appeared, his hair standing on end in anger, and his eyes bloodshot. This scoundrel publicly humiliated the crown prince, jeopardizing my son&#x27;s future, and shaking the very foundation of the nation. If I don&#x27;t kill him today, I swear I&#x27;m not worthy of being called a man.</p>
<p>Humiliation? Old Sheen smiled, took a sip of tea. On the arena, victory and defeat were determined, as well as life and death. When your son used the true dragon descent technique to kill Shin Yuan, why didn&#x27;t you step in to stop him? Now that you&#x27;ve knelt down and feel ashamed, you want to kill me to silence me. Old Sheen put down his teacup, and two chilling glints suddenly shot out from his cloudy old eyes. Long out, Yen.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m putting my words right here. This kid is the future I&#x27;ve chosen. As long as I have a breath left, I will break the bones of anyone who dares to lay a finger on me, whether they are an eighth realm marshal emperor or some royal relative. Hard. It&#x27;s too hard.</p>
<p>All the powerful figures in the capital fell silent at this moment. No one expected that old Sheen, who usually only tried to smooth things over and acted like a coward, would actually break ties with the royal family for the sake of Shin Yuan. Long out Yians face turned ashen. He knew he couldn&#x27;t beat Shin Jan. This old monster was known as a ninth realm demagod, but no one had ever seen his true strength.</p>
<p>He might have already taken that half step. Excellent. What a brilliant Chen battle. Long out Yen took a deep breath, pulled out a jade slip that emitted starlight from his pocket, and a ruthless glint flashed in his eyes. Can you protect him for a while or for a lifetime? Don&#x27;t forget, the reason my long family was able to secure this throne is not just because of this small piece of land on blue star.</p>
<p>My ancestor has already attained the 11th realm of star lordship in the outer realms. He will be returning soon. Chin Jean, if you know what&#x27;s good for you, step back now, and I&#x27;ll only that brat&#x27;s cultivation and spare his life. Otherwise, when the ancestor arrives, not only that brat, but even your old bones will be buried with him. 11th Realm Star-Lord.</p>
<p>The moment those five words were uttered, even the air seemed to freeze. On Earth, the Ninth Realm is already the ceiling. The 11th realm is for super strong individuals who can traverse the void with their physical bodies and shatter stars with a single punch. Old Sheen&#x27;s fingers, which were holding the teacup, paused slightly, but it was only for one meal. The 11th realm is indeed intimidating.</p>
<p>Old Sheen side, but it wasn&#x27;t out of fear. It was more like a mockery. But have you forgotten that there are always higher heavens and more capable people out there? Chapter 181. Huaning makes her appearance trying to harm my disciple. Before long, A Yin could even react to what those words meant.</p>
<p>Sizzle. The space directly above the dragon&#x27;s nest looked as if it had been torn open by an invisible claw, leaving a huge gash. A tiny silver gray shuttle, exuding a suffocatingly high-dimensional pressure, slowly emerged from the crack. The shuttle door opened. A jade-like foot clad in black stiletto heels stepped onto the void.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, Huan Nongying, dressed in a deep purple highlit Chong Sam, walked down step by step, waving a folding fan. She walked very slowly. Wow, it&#x27;s quite lively here. Huan Nongys eyes were alluring as she swept her gaze over the eighth realm marshall emperor before finally settling on the star jade slip, and she chuckled softly. Who are you trying to scare by bringing out a minor star lord at the 11th realm? She snapped her folding fan shut, pointed at Long A Yins nose, and spoke in a language yet extremely doineering tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Go back and tell your ancestor.&quot; Shiny Yuan is now the personal disciple of Huan Nongy, a special grade instructor from the Seventh Martial Arts Domain Academy, the Primal Evolution sect. That is someone even her majesty the Empress is paying attention to. If he wants to harm my apprentice, fine. Huan Noming pulled out a badge engraved with a golden dragon and phoenix from the unfathomable cleavage of her chest and tossed it casually. Tell him to go to the domain academy first and remove the badge as long as he has the guts.</p>
<p>Golden dragon and phoenix. The moment Long Yin saw the badge, he was terrified and the star jade slip in his hand which originally symbolized the family&#x27;s heritage almost fell from his hand in fright. That&#x27;s the personal seal of the human queen in this universe. Who doesn&#x27;t know what this golden dragon and phoenix emblem represents? That was supreme imperial power. That was slaughter.</p>
<p>That was absolute taboo. The dragon family patriarch is nothing but a fart in front of that person. You are. Long Yians voice trembled and the pressure of his eighth realm marshall emperor aura instantly dissipated completely. Roll.</p>
<p>Huaning parted her red lips slightly and uttered only one word. Long out Yins face turned deathly pale, and he didn&#x27;t dare to utter a single harsh word. The purple gold pillars that filled the sky instantly receded, and he transformed into a streak of light, retreating in a sorry state to the depths of the imperial city. He even activated the mountain protecting formation, fearing that this female fiend would storm into the palace. Huan Nongying then dropped her fierce demeanor, turned around, and gave Shin Yuan a flirtatious wink at him on the arena below.</p>
<p>My good disciple, wasn&#x27;t your teacher&#x27;s assist cool? Shin Yuan stood on the arena, looking at the woman in the sky, who had just been exuding doineering aura, but was now acting frivolously. His lips twitched, and he gave her a thumbs up. The teacher is awesome. The teacher is magnanimous. These powerful connections are incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>The battle among the gods and the heavens has ended, but the drama on Earth must continue. Shinuan felt incredibly satisfied watching the Dragon Clan chief slink away. Now that&#x27;s good. The biggest obstacle has been driven away. Who would dare to stop him now? He straightened the collar of his windblown trench coat and turned to look at Mu Ching Shiua who stood at the edge of the stage like a goddess of moonlight.</p>
<p>Young married woman Shinuan opened his arms wide, his smile as bright as a flower, and was about to rush onto the stage. That old man interrupted us earlier. Now nobody&#x27;s bothering us. Come on, give me a hug. Let&#x27;s get this engagement settled first.</p>
<p>Then we&#x27;ll consummate the marriage tonight and hopefully Longing will have a sibling next year. Standing on the stage, Mu Ching Shua looked at the man who had just trampled a crown prince underfoot and was now rushing over like a rogue. Her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it would jump out of her throat. This is the man she chose. Arrogant, doineering, and unruly.</p>
<p>But in critical moments, they can stand tall and shield everyone from all storms. Instead of dodging, she stepped forward. her clear, cold eyes welling up with tears and opened her arms, ready to welcome her hero. However, just a second before Shinuans hand was about to touch Mu Chingshus slender waist. Stop.</p>
<p>A pink after image, extremely tackless, cut in, blocking the two like a wall. Su Xiao Yao flapped her wings, holding a megaphone, and roared wildly into Shun Yuans ear. Shin Yuan, what are you doing? Are you trying to openly steal the bride? Shin Yuans head was buzzing from the shock and he glared at the pink-haired lowly with a displeased expression. Its you again? Can&#x27;tt you be a little more discerning? Didn&#x27;tt you see that the diva agreed? This is mutual affection. It&#x27;s love.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you understand? Love my ass. Su Xiao Yao put her hands on her hips and pointed to the still flashing large screen above her head. Look carefully. The competition isn&#x27;t over yet. You only beat Long Shiao and made it to the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s still the semi-finals, the finals, and the grand finals. Su Xiao Yao pointed to the few people still sitting in the contestant seats. Chin Schu is still here. Xiao Hongi is still here. Even your female instructor is still here.</p>
<p>If you run away with Mu Ching Shua now, that&#x27;s forfeiting the competition. Your championship will be revoked. See, if Muing Shua will still marry you, then upon hearing this, Mu Ching Shua, who was still immersed in a romantic atmosphere, instantly regained her senses. Yes, the promise was to marry the champion who was famous throughout the empire. If Shin Yuan were to forfeit the competition now, he would be a deserter, losing not only the championship, but also becoming a laughingstock throughout the empire.</p>
<p>If Muing Shua marries him, wouldn&#x27;t she become a laughingtock? That&#x27;s Shin Yuan. Muing Shua blushed and gently pushed Shin Yuans chest. Miss Su is right. You should finish your match first. I&#x27;ll let you hug me after you get the real first place.</p>
<p>After saying that, she lifted her skirt and ran off the stage like a startled fawn, leaving Shinuan with only her back view that made his heart itch. Hey, no. Shinuans outstretched hand frozen midair. He watched Mu Ching Shus retreating figure, then looked at Su Xiao Yao in front of him, who was saying, I&#x27;m doing this for your own good. He was so angry that his teeth itched.</p>
<p>Fine, you win. Shin Yuan pointed fiercely at Su Xiao Yao. When I win the championship, the first thing I&#x27;ll do is roast you, you pink feathered bird. Su Xiao shrank back, but still forced herself to shout, &quot;Next round, quarterfinals.&quot; Shin yuan faces off against Yigu Yun, the sword immortal of the southern border. Yigu Yun.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan raised an eyebrow and looked towards the players seats. The young man, who always carried an ancient sword and was dressed in snow white robes, slowly stood up. He was very handsome, but not with the aggressive nobility of Long Shiao, nor with the roguish charm of Shen Yuan. Rather, it is a kind of cleanliness. It was as clean as a flawless piece of jade or a sharp sword just drawn from its sheath.</p>
<p>Unlike the others, he didn&#x27;t leap onto the stage. Instead, he lightly touched the ground with his toes and floated down 10 m opposite Shin Yuan, as if riding the wind. Her clothes fluttered in the breeze, yet her hair remained perfectly styled. That&#x27;s what you call class. Yiguyun from the southern border.</p>
<p>Please enlighten me. Yiguin clasped his hands slightly, his voice clear, and neither humble nor arrogant. Even though he had just witnessed Shun Yuan brutally beating Long Sha, there was no fear in his eyes, only a pure fighting spirit. That&#x27;s interesting. Shiny Yuan threw away the lollipop in his hand that had been crushed and looked Yuyun up and down.</p>
<p>Your outfit is quite nice. You look much better than that Nuvo Reong Sha. However, Shin Yuan changed the subject, grinned, and said, &quot;Want to beat me? Is your sword hard enough?&quot; Chapter 182. Sword immortal Yigu Yun. I admit defeat, but I refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>Yigu Yun smiled calmly and gripped the hilt of the sword behind his back. Clang. A sword cry like the roar of a dragon resounded throughout the arena. The long sword was drawn. The blade is not made of metal, but of a translucent cyan crystal with cloud-like patterns flowing across it.</p>
<p>This sword is named flowing cloud, and it was forged from the thousand-year-old cold crystals at the bottom of the heavenly pool in the southern realm. Yiguun flicked his wrist, and the tip of his sword twirled into a beautiful sword flower. Whether it&#x27;s hard or not, you&#x27;ll know once you try it. Okay, let&#x27;s give it a try. Without wasting words, Shin Yuan suddenly exerted force with his feet and shot out like a cannonball.</p>
<p>There were no fancy moves, just a simple straight punch. With the physical strength of a mid-stage fifthrem cultivator combined with the burst of dragon blood, this punch was enough to shatter a small mountain. Faced with this overwhelming punch, Yiguyun did not dodge. His eyes narrowed and he suddenly thrust out the flowing clouds sword in his hand. Southern sky sword cloud breaker buzz.</p>
<p>A streak of cyan sword energy as thin as a cicada&#x27;s wing was extremely sharp, precisely striking the weakest point of Shan Yuan&#x27;s fist. Laugh. Shiny Yuan felt as if his fist had hit a ball of cotton and most of his strength was dissipated. Then a sharp sword aura rushed up his arm and straight to his shoulder. Um Shinyuan paused and a white mark was cut into the golden dragon scale on his arm.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t break through his defenses, but it was enough to surprise him. This is a technique, ultimate skill, excellent swordsmanship. Shinyuan laughed loudly again. In the next few minutes, sword energy crisscrossed the arena and fist shadows danced. Yiga Yun was like a petrol darting through a storm.</p>
<p>His movements incredibly graceful. No matter how heavy or fast Shinuan&#x27;s punches were, they were difficult to land a real blow on him. His sword always managed to strike from the most tricky angles, forcing Shin Yuan to defend. This is the true style of a sword immortal. Stylish, sharp, yet elegant.</p>
<p>The audience below the stage was stunned. What? This Yigu Yun is something else. He can actually fight Shin Yuan to a standstill. That movement was so cool. Shin Yuan looks like a clumsy bear trying to catch a butterfly.</p>
<p>The southern sword immortal truly lives up to his name. Although his strength is not as great as Shen Yuan&#x27;s, his technical skills are simply a feast for the eyes. Pity. In the face of absolute power, skill ultimately has its limits. Warm-up complete.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan suddenly stopped moving, letting a sword aura slash at his chest, producing a crisp sound of metal clashing. He looked at Yigu Yun, who was still wandering around and twisted his neck. You must be tired of chopping, too. It&#x27;s my turn. Boom.</p>
<p>Dash. Shun Yuan&#x27;s dragon blood boiled again. But this time, he did not release the power outwards, but compressed it all into his body. Self-created secret technique. Dragon pressure domain thump centered on Shun Yuan.</p>
<p>The gravity within a radius of 50 meters instantly increased tenfold. Yigi Yun, who was riding the wind in midair, suddenly stopped. The feeling of floating vanished instantly, and he fell straight down as if he were being weighed down by thousands of pounds of lead. I&#x27;ve got you. Shinyuan figure appeared before Yigu Yun like a ghost.</p>
<p>No punch was thrown. Instead, he extended a finger and gently touched the tip of Yigu Yuns sword. Bite. A crisp sound. The flowing cloud sword, which was said to be forged from millennial old cold crystal, actually began to crack inch by inch from the tip.</p>
<p>Yiguns face turned pale, and he used the force of the recoil to retreat dozens of meters, barely managing to regain his footing. He stared at the broken sword, now only half intact, in his hand, and remained silent for a moment. Instead of the dejection of defeat on his face, he showed a relieved smile. He shaved the broken sword and solemnly clasped his hands in a fist salute to Shin Yuan. One force can overcome 10 techniques.</p>
<p>Brother Shan has achieved physical saintthood and is no longer harmed by ordinary swords. You lost this match. After saying that, he turned and left without waiting for the referee&#x27;s announcement. His back view still dashing as if he had not lost a match that concerned his fate, but only lost a sword that was not easy to handle. That&#x27;s a real man.</p>
<p>be able to take it on and put it down. The audience erupted in applause. Yigu Yun had lost the contest, but he had earned respect. Su Xiao Yao quickly flew over to announce, &quot;Shinuan wins. He advances to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Shinyuan wins. Advances to the semi-finals. Su Xiaos voice had just fallen.&quot; The group of haters in the audience who were just criticizing Shin Yuan for only being able to beat weaker opponents suddenly fell silent like ducks being choked. Yigi Yun, the sword immortal of the southern border, was a renowned master of technical skill whose movements were as graceful as a ghost. Yet, his natal sword was broken by Shin Yuan with a single flick of his finger.</p>
<p>Who would dare call this bullying newbies? This is a dimensional reduction attack. Shin Yuan, with his hands in his pockets, showed no excitement after his victory, but rather looked unsatisfied as he strolled off the stage. As he passed by Su Xiao Yao, who was still in a daysaze, he didn&#x27;t forget to snatch a spare microphone from her hand. Hey you guys, those guys who booed me earlier, Shin Yuan pointed to a corner of the audience seats and said with a smile, &quot;Don&#x27;t rush off. Well settle this score after I win the trophy.&quot; After saying that, he tossed the microphone behind him, which landed precisely in Su Xiaoyas arms and then plopped back down in the center position of the contestants bench, which had been warmed up by Akasha.</p>
<p>Dragon Lord, that finger strike you just made was so cool. Akasha immediately moved closer, ignoring the numerous cameras around them, clinging to him like she had no bones, her purple eyes sparkling. It was like a punishment sent down by the gods. Basic operation, don&#x27;t be silly. Shin Yuan enjoyed the beauty&#x27;s adoration and casually pinched her smooth cheek.</p>
<p>This Yigu Yun is quite capable, but unfortunately, she met me. The pace of the following matches was very fast. Chinua was fighting against the heavily armored man in the tin can who seemed to be the heir of a defensive family in the western region. The burly man relying on his tortois shell-like armor originally intended to engage in a war of attrition with Chinua. However, Chinu didn&#x27;t give him a chance at all.</p>
<p>And upon entering the arena, she only made one move. Raising her hand, the tomb is frozen in ice. He uttered four words. The falling snow transformed into a massive crystal clearar ice coffin, freezing the large man, armor and all inside. He couldn&#x27;t move, not even his eyes.</p>
<p>Instant kill. Shin Yuan, watching from below the stage, was utterly astonished. Wow, this girl has quite the temper. If I marry her, I won&#x27;t need to turn on the air conditioning in the summer. Longing glanced at him, but didn&#x27;t say anything.</p>
<p>She just instinctively covered her lower abdomen with her hand. Next, Longing took the stage. Her opponent was a sneaky assassin who used hidden weapons. That guy was running around the field throwing knives and poison needles in his hand using all sorts of tricks. Unfortunately, in front of Longing, who had activated her dragon soul battle body, these fancy tricks were like children playing house.</p>
<p>Longing didn&#x27;t even draw her sword. She simply activated her pale golden dragon scale armor, letting the clanging of hidden weapons strike her body, then walked step by step to the desperate assassin, delivering a simple and brutal whip kick that sent him flying off the stage. Dong Hai Longing advances to the semifinals. The final four are now set. Shinyuan, Chinua, Longing, and Xiao Hongi, who is currently warming up.</p>
<p>The next and final match is the quarterfinals. Su Xiaoa shouted. Xiao Hongi from the northern border versus the aesthetic monk from the western border, Taan. This is definitely a fierce battle like Mars colliding with Earth. Taan is known as the indestructible Vajra, and his physical strength has reached its peak.</p>
<p>In some ways, his physical strength is even comparable to that of the previous Vajra demon ape. Xiao Hongi, on the other hand, was a notorious violent maniac, wielding a black and gold spear to subdue any who dared to defy her. The two of them didn&#x27;t exchange a single polite word as soon as they stepped onto the stage. Roar! Taon stomped his feet on the ground, and his monk&#x27;s robe exploded instantly, revealing his terrifying muscles that looked as if they had been poured with molten copper. His skin had a strange dark gold color with faint sounds of chanting emanating from it.</p>
<p>Budra Dharma image. He charged towards Ziao Hongi like a cannonball without any fancy moves, just the most simple and unadorned punch. Xiao Hongi snorted coldly, her high red ponytail whipping out in a clean arc. She gripped the gun barrel tightly with both hands, met the iron fist, and slammed it down with all her might. Gun soul, mountain crash, boom dash.</p>
<p>A loud bang was heard, and a shock wave rolled out. To everyone&#x27;s astonishment, Taon, known for his strength, was actually forced to kneel on one knee by this single shot. A white mark was actually smashed into that indestructible Vudra body. Break it for me. Xiao Hongi once she gained power was ruthless.</p>
<p>The spear in his hand transformed into a sky full of spear shadows pouring down like a storm. Each shot whistled through the air. Each shot precisely striking the weakest point in the Iron Mountains defenses. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! The arena was bustling with activity like a blacksmith&#x27;s hammer being struck. Less than three minutes, the aesthetic monk, who was known for his invincible defense, was beaten into a pig&#x27;s head by Xiao Hongi, and his proud Vudra body was pierced with several holes, bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>I surrender. Please have mercy, female benefactor. Taan felt so frustrated, he wanted to cry. This wasn&#x27;t a woman. She was practically a humanoid Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p>
<p>H trash. Xiao Hongi stood with her gun sheath, her red armor gleaming under the lights, her heroic bearing captivating all who looked at her. She glanced defiantly in Shun Yuans direction, pointing the tip of her spear at him. Shinuan, you&#x27;ve made it to the semi-finals. Wash your neck and wait.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan leaned back in his chair, looking at the arrogant Valkyrie on the stage, and stroked his chin. Wow, that&#x27;s so violent. If this guy ever gets into a house, he&#x27;ll be tearing the house down every day. He turned to look at Akasha beside him and grinned wickedly. Akasha, once this girl comes home, I&#x27;ll hand her over to you.</p>
<p>Your training methods seem pretty effective, don&#x27;t they? Akasha paused for a moment. Then a glint of excitement flashed in her purple eyes, and she licked her red lips with the tip of her tongue. Rest assured, dragon lord, no matter how wild the horse is, it will become the most obedient kitten in my hands. Chapter 183. Violent female gunner.</p>
<p>A wild horse that needs taming. All right, after this fierce competition, our final four have finally been determined. Su Xia Yao flapped her wings and flew to the center of the arena. Although she was quite angry with Sha Yuan just now, her professionalism still forced her to force a smile for photos lit up on the big screen. Shin Yuan, that photo is a candid shot of him with a lollipop in his mouth and a smug look on his face.</p>
<p>Chin Shua was as cold as ice and so beautiful that people dared not look directly at her. Xiao Hongi clad in red armor and wielding a long spear exudes a commanding presence. Longing dressed in a crisp military uniform exudes a dashing and heroic air, one man and three women. Moreover, each of these three women is a top tier goddess capable of causing a sensation throughout the entire empire. This lineup of four finalists is simply a visual feast.</p>
<p>Next, the draw for the semi-finals will take place. Su Xiao Yao waved her hand and four names began to scroll wildly on the big screen. The hearts of the entire audience were in their throats. Who will Shinuan encounter? Is it Xiao Hongi, the one who&#x27;s always been at odds with him? Is it still the same Chin Schwa, the icy goddess who was so shocked by him that she vomited blood? Or perhaps it was that instructor Long who was pregnant with his child. Stop.</p>
<p>With Su Xiaoas command, the names on the big screen were frozen in time. Group one, Dong Hai. Ling versus Beijing. Xiao Hongi. Group two, Shin Yuan from the East China Sea versus Chin Shua from the Imperial Capital.</p>
<p>Wo! The whole place erupted in chaos. What? This group assignment is amazing. A Valkyrie civil war. Dong Hai Longing versus Beijing. Xiao Hongi.</p>
<p>This is a clash of titans between two future female warriors. And then there&#x27;s Shin Yuan and Shinua. A clash of ice and fire. No, I mean a battle between ice and dragons. That&#x27;s exciting.</p>
<p>So exciting. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s eyes lit up instantly when she saw the result. She turned around and looked at Longing, who was sitting quietly not far away, her eyes burning with fighting spirit. Compared to Shin Yuan, who was all talk and no action, but also very strong, she actually wanted to fight longing more. Both were from war zones and were hailed as successors to the female war goddess.</p>
<p>She had been waiting for this battle for a long time. Longing Xiao Hongi picked up her spear and shouted across the distance. Her voice filled with excitement. Come on, let me see whether your swords from the east sea are faster or our spears from the north are more ruthless. The atmosphere on the stage reached its climax at this moment.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi was the first to leap onto the ring. Her red armor gleamed under the lights, and the black and gold spear in her hand pointed diagonally at the ground, making her look like a burning flame. Longing, come up here. Xiao Hongi was filled with fighting spirit, her eyes sparkling with the purest desire for battle. I can tell you&#x27;re pregnant, but I won&#x27;t hold back.</p>
<p>Once you&#x27;re in the ring, you&#x27;re a warrior. I will show you my utmost respect. The audience below the stage was also infected by the atmosphere, and they all cheered loudly. Beat, beat, beat. A clash of female warriors who will be the Empire&#x27;s future number one Valkyrie.</p>
<p>Amidst the spotlight, Longing stood up. She was wearing that black form-fitting combat suit. Her flat stomach wasn&#x27;t showing yet, but if you looked closely, you could see that she walked with more caution than before. Carrying her battle sword, she walked step by step onto the arena. With each step she took, her aura grew stronger.</p>
<p>That battle hardened, fierce aura was in no way weaker than Xiao Hongese. In fact, it was even more composed and reserved. The two stood in the center of the ring, 10 m apart. The air froze. On one side, a raging fire spreads.</p>
<p>On the other, deep sea currents surged. A clash of titans. Xiao Hongi gripped the spear tightly, and the vital energy within her body began to circulate wildly, causing a phantom image of a red lotus to bloom on the tip of the spear. Are you ready? Xiao Hongi&#x27;s lips curled up into a wild smile. I&#x27;m going to go.</p>
<p>Just when everyone thought a world shaking battle was about to break out, longing suddenly released her grip on the knife hilt. The 300 lb alloy battle sword clattered into the ground beside him. On the face of this female major, known for her ironfisted nature, a rare and gentle tenderness, tinged with maternal glow, appeared. She gently placed her palm on her lower abdomen. There was a tiny but resilient little life there, connected to her by blood.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi Long Yings voice was calm, devoid of the murderous aura she usually displayed on the battlefield, and instead exuded an inscrable indifference. Your gun is indeed very powerful. If it were before, I would have fought you to the bitter end, even if it meant getting seriously injured. Xiao Hongi was taken aback, her imposing aura momentarily faltering. What do you mean? Are you going to admit defeat? No, it&#x27;s not admitting defeat.</p>
<p>Longing shook her head, a sly glint in her beautiful eyes. Her gaze passed over Ziao Hongi and landed on Shun Yuan, who was looking at them with a wicked grin. Now I am more than just a soldier. I am also a mother.&quot; When she mentioned the word mother, a blush rose on Long Yings face, but her tone remained unusually firm. The doctor said that I need to rest for the first 3 months and avoid strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>Especially, you can&#x27;tt fight with a violent maniac like you. Xiao Hongi audience. So Ling shrugged, a gesture that bore a striking resemblance to Shin Yuanss. She raised one hand with remarkable grace and shouted to Sue Xiao Yao in midair. Referee, I forfeit this match.</p>
<p>Quiet, a deathly silence. Xiao Hongi nearly dropped her long spear, which she had been holding firmly. She stared wideeyed at Ling as if she were some kind of oddball, completely dumbfounded. You&#x27;re abstaining. Xiao Hongi felt like she had been holding back her punch for 10,000 years, only to have it land on cotton.</p>
<p>The frustration almost made her vomit blood. Are you kidding me? I&#x27;m all warmed up. My pants are all Oops. I&#x27;m all fired up, and you&#x27;re telling me you&#x27;re going to be pregnant? No way. Longing spread her hands innocently.</p>
<p>This is the Shun family seedling. If you damage it with one shot, can you afford to pay for it? Besides, Longing picked up the battle sword from the ground, turned around, and left, leaving behind only a dashing silhouette. Pregnancy is also a part of strength. Puff dash. Shin Yuan, sitting in the audience, burst out laughing, spraying all the water he had just drunk onto Zhao Yis head in front of him.</p>
<p>Wow, that&#x27;s brilliant. Shin Yuan slapped his thigh, laughing so hard that tears almost came out. As expected of my wife. Such awareness. Such a knack for roasting people.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s truly inherited my skills. Zhao E wiped the water off his head, not daring to get angry, and could only grin foolishly. Sister-in-law is awesome. Sister-in-law is so powerful. This is what you call winning without bloodshed.</p>
<p>On stage, Xiao Hongi stood in the wind, bewildered. She watched Long Yings light and airy departing figure, trembling with anger, her red armor clattering loudly. Aa Shinuan, Longing, you two scoundrels. In a fit of rage, Xiao Hongi slammed her spear into the ground, creating a large crater in the alloy floor. I refuse to accept this.</p>
<p>What kind of victory is this? This is utterly humiliating. Su Xiao was speechless in the sky. This year&#x27;s Battle of the Prodigies is cursed. First, Shin Yuan stunned everyone, and now Ling has given up her rights to focus on her pregnancy. Can&#x27;t we just have a proper fight? But rules are rules.</p>
<p>Cough, cough. Su Xiao Yao reluctantly announced, &quot;Longing has forfeited. Xiao Hongi has won and advanced to the finals. She won, but Xiao Hongs face looked even uglier than if she had lost.&quot; She stormed off the stage, and as she passed Shin Yuan, she turned her head and glared at him. Just you wait.</p>
<p>During the finals, I&#x27;m going to poke a thousand holes in you. Shin Yuan chuckled and whistled, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome anytime, but remember to be gentle. I&#x27;m afraid of pain. you. Xiao Hongi was so angry she almost fainted and could only stomp her feet and run away.</p>
<p>Chapter 184. Pregnancy is also a form of strength. The ice queen makes her debut. Okay. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of the little incident.</p>
<p>Su Xiao quickly steered the conversation back on track, fearing that something unexpected might happen during the competition. Next up is the second match of the semi-finals. Shinuan from the East Sea will face Chin Shua from the capital. As Su Xiao Yaos raspy voice rang out, the atmosphere in the Dragon Nest arena shifted from the comical scene of Xiao Hongi running away in anger and was instead enveloped by a more somber, even chilling chill. Chinua stood up.</p>
<p>Her bear jade feet lightly touched the ground, and a crystal clearar ice lotus appeared out of thin air beneath her feet, supporting her graceful figure as she floated lightly to the side of the arena. It landed silently, but the alloy ground within a 100 meters radius of her was covered with a thick layer of white frost. The moisture in the air is quickly frozen, turning into countless tiny ice crystals that refract a dreamy yet dangerous blue light under the spotlight. This is hardly a fight scene. This is clearly the moon goddess descending to Earth to turn this world into frozen soil.</p>
<p>Shinuan was much more relaxed. He turned up the collar of his trench coat, put his hands in his pockets, and strolled up with an air of nonulence. As she walked, she blew kisses to Akasha in the audience, causing the countest to tremble with excitement once again. The two stopped. They are 20 m apart.</p>
<p>On one side, snow was falling heavily and the air was bitterly cold. On the other side, someone was nonchalant and had a wicked grin on their face. Chin, the campus bell, looks great. Shin Yuan spoke first, his eyes sweeping over Chin Schwe&#x27;s delicate body which was wrapped in a flowing dress before finally settling on her icy cold face. Did the blood you just vomited leave any after effects? If you feel tightness in your chest, remember to tell me.</p>
<p>I may not have much medical ethics, but my massage skills are exceptional, and I specialize in treating all kinds of chest tightness and shortness of breath. Chin Schwe icy blue eyes narrowed slightly. Shut up. The sound of ice beads falling onto a jade plate carries a chilling penetrating coldness. Shinuan, don&#x27;t think that just because you defeated Long Sha, you can definitely defeat me.</p>
<p>Chinua raised her hand, and a dark blue storm was rapidly gathering in her palm. Your physical body is indeed very strong, ridiculously strong, but martial arts are not just about brute force. Faced with absolute low temperatures, even steel becomes as brittle as glass. No matter how hot your dragon blood is, I can turn you into an eternalized sculpture. Tsk tsk tsk, how fierce.</p>
<p>Shinuan shook his head, his smile widening. But Chen, the campus bell, have you forgotten something? Shinyuan stretched out a finger and pointed to his cheek. We made a bet in that secret room in the East China Sea. Your master, the god of war, Jade Ling Long, was also present. You said that as long as I beat you in the battle of the prodigies, you would agree to my request.</p>
<p>The game isn&#x27;t over yet, but I think we all know the outcome. Shinuan took a step forward. If you lose later, are you planning to kiss here or come back to the room with me and kiss slowly? Boom. These words were like a spark thrown directly into Chin Schwe&#x27;s powder keg. No, it was an ice bucket.</p>
<p>A crack appeared on Chin Schwe icy expression. That was shame and indignation. That was anger. Shameless lecher. Go to hell.</p>
<p>Chinu said no more and unleashed the dark blue storm from her palm. Ice Age. Snap. The white frost covering the ground transformed into a roaring surging glacier. Countless sharp ice spikes as sharp as knives came from the ground, from the air, and from all directions, shrieking as they hurdled towards Shun Yuan.</p>
<p>The entire arena instantly transformed into a massive ice prison where even the air became thick and suffocating. What? GoddessQ is serious. Who can withstand this move? Is this the true value of an SSS level ice phoenix talent? Shin Yuan overestimated himself this time. No matter how tough his physical body is, it can&#x27;t withstand this kind of magical attack. A gasp rippled through the audience.</p>
<p>However, Shin Yuan, who was in the eye of the storm of the glacier, did not even try to hide. He remained expressionless as he watched the overwhelming surge of extremely cold ice spikes. Cold? It is indeed a bit cold. But Shinuan took his right hand out of his pocket. That hand did not transform into the dragon claw form covered in golden dragon scales that it had before.</p>
<p>Instead, smack. He snapped his fingers. It was an extremely crisp sound. Since it&#x27;s cold, let&#x27;s start a fire. Boom! Dash! As the snap of the fingers fell, a burst of crimson gold flame erupted from Shun Yuan&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>But this flame is no ordinary fire. It has a strange fluid-like appearance like magma or burning gold with a terrifyingly high temperature that could burn the sky and is extremely doineering. SS rank talent. Undying flame soul. Start.</p>
<p>Sizzle. The rushing glacier. Upon contact with this crimson gold flame didn&#x27;t even need to melt into water. It was instantly vaporized. A cloud of white mist rose up and enveloped the entire arena.</p>
<p>And within that white mist, Shin Yuan was bathed in crimson gold flames. His black hair danced wildly, and his eyes blazed like torches. He was like a fire god emerging from purgatory. Wherever he passed, ice and snow melted, and everything turned to ash. What? Fire? How is this possible? The information says he has an frrank talent.</p>
<p>He only showed physical strength just now. How could he possibly possess such terrifying fire talent? Moreover, the level of this flame. When Shin Shua encountered this crimson gold flame, the ice phoenix bloodline within her body actually produced a slight reaction. It wasn&#x27;t just Shinua. Even Huan Nongying, who had been lazily watching the show from the silver warship in the sky, sat up straight.</p>
<p>She swayed the wine glass in her hand, spilling a few drops of crimson wine onto her snow white thighs, but she was completely unaware. Those peach blossom eyes were fixed on the man on the screen who was engulfed in flames. And the light in those eyes was frighteningly bright. Twin talents. No, it&#x27;s multiple talents.</p>
<p>The dragon blood that enabled physical immortality has now been combined with an extreme flame powerful enough to rival the ice phoenix. Juaning stuck out her tongue and licked the drop of wine that had splashed at the corner of her mouth. Her expression becoming both greedy and excited. What a gem. This flame is extremely strong and young.</p>
<p>If it were used to make that kind of taste, it would probably melt a person&#x27;s bones. This course on primitive evolution needs to be made a bit more difficult in advance. On the arena, the white mist dissipated. Shinyuan stood on a scorched ground. The surrounding ice spikes long since vanished.</p>
<p>He raised his hand and a ball of crimson gold flame danced at his fingertips like an obedient sprite. Chen, the campus bell. Don&#x27;t be so surprised. Shiny Yuan grinned as he looked at Chin Shu, who was staring at him in astonishment these days. Who doesn&#x27;t have a side hustle since you are ice and I am fire? Let&#x27;s take a look.</p>
<p>Is your ice harder or is my fire hotter? Chapter 185. Fire fist shinuan. That must be the magma magma fruit. Sideline. No matter how many trump cards Shin Yuan was hiding, Chin Schwa could not afford to lose this battle.</p>
<p>She is the pride of theQin family, the disciple of the god of warling long and the owner of the SSS level ice phoenix bloodline. Then let me see just how much fire you have. Chinwa formed a hand seal and the surrounding temperature dropped sharply again. Ice Phoenix thousand feather kill. Whoosh whoosh.</p>
<p>Countless ice feathers formed from extremely cold and mysterious ice appeared in the air, densely packed and covering the sky. Each ice feather was as sharp as a knife carrying a swirling energy and rained down on Shin Yuan like a storm. This move is a wide area attack. There&#x27;s no way to dodge it. Flashy and gaudy, Shin Yuan looked at the icy rain falling from the sky, and curled his lip.</p>
<p>He squatted down slightly, clenched his right fist, and tucked it into his waist. The crimson gold flames converged wildly toward his right fist, compressing and compressing until his entire right arm turned into an almost transparent crimson red, as if what flowed inside was not blood, but scalding magma. Suddenly, a scene from a shownen anime he had watched in his previous life flashed through Shun Yuans mind. The man who always wore a cowboy hat and showed off his chest muscles. Since we&#x27;re playing with fire, let&#x27;s pay homage to the classics.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuans expression was arrogant. A right fist slams out. Fire fist. Boom. A massive pillar of fire over 10 m in diameter roared out from Shan Yuan&#x27;s fist.</p>
<p>That wasn&#x27;t an ordinary fire shock wave. It was a raging dragon formed from high-pressure flames. Wherever the flames passed, the air was immediately sucked away, producing a shrill explosion. The icy feathers that swept in from all directions were like moths drawn to the blazing sun in the face of this terrifying fire fist. It didn&#x27;t even last a second.</p>
<p>It was burned to nothingness. The fiery fist continued its relentless advance, carrying a devastating force as it hurdled straight toward Chin Schwe&#x27;s face. What? Chin Schwe&#x27;s expression changed drastically. The power of this flame is outrageous. She didn&#x27;t have time to retaliate.</p>
<p>She slammed both hands on the ground. Ice crystal barrier triple click click click. Three thick blue ice walls rose up in front of her. However, bang, bang, bang. Fire fist moves with impunity.</p>
<p>The first ice wall shattered. The second ice wall melts. The third ice wall lasted only half a second before it shattered. Chinu was thrown into the air by the terrifying heat wave, performing an elegant backflip before finally landing. Her snow white long dress had a scorched hem, revealing her fair calves underneath.</p>
<p>Her meticulously styled hair was somewhat disheveled with a few strands sticking to her sweaty forehead. She only suffered minor injuries, but for someone who always presented herself as a cool and aloof goddess, it was already a huge embarrassment. Too weak. Shin Yuan withdrew his fist, blew away the non-existent blue smoke, and looked disappointed. Chen, the campus bell.</p>
<p>Is that all you&#x27;ve got? The fire has only just started to heat up, and you can&#x27;t handle it already. If we get married, and I&#x27;m still so angry, what will you do to put out my fire? Shut up. Every time Chin Shua heard his foul language, her chest heaved violently with anger. She gritted her teeth, her eyes flashing with a cold light. Shinuan, don&#x27;t get too cocky.</p>
<p>Glacier grand funeral. Chinu no longer held back, and the vital energy within her body surged wildly. The ground of the entire arena suddenly began to shake violently. Immediately afterwards, countless huge ice spikes, like spikes from the ground, pierced out from under Shun Yuan&#x27;s feet. We&#x27;ll turn him into a hedgehog.</p>
<p>Shun Yuan reacted, leaped high into the air, and while in midair, his hands strangely transformed into a crimson liquid. That wasn&#x27;t an ordinary flame. That&#x27;s lava. That was ace just now. Now it&#x27;s Enu Notous turn.</p>
<p>Shinyuan grinned, a smile full of tyranny. He unleashed a barrage of punches downwards. Massive eruption, meteor volcano. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Countless enormous fist shadows formed from crimson flames and magma rain down from the sky like a meteor shower.</p>
<p>This scene was like the end of the world. Every lava fist strike that hits the ground triggers a small volcanic eruption. The newly protruding ice spikes were smashed to pieces by the lava fist shadow, turning into pools of boiling water. In just a few seconds, the entire arena transformed from an extremely cold, icy plane into a scorched wasteland flowing with lava. The collision of ice and fire stirred up a cloud of water vapor.</p>
<p>And in that rising mist, Chinwed dodged left and right in a sorry state. Her ice type defense seemed so fragile under Shin Yuan&#x27;s unreasonable magma bombardment. Damn it, what kind of flame is this? Chinua was horrified. Her ice phoenix frost aura is said to be able to freeze everything. But Shin Yuan&#x27;s fire not only had an absurdly high temperature, but also possessed an extremely doineering adhesiveness and corrosiveness.</p>
<p>Once you&#x27;re hooked, it&#x27;s like a maggot clinging to your bone. It won&#x27;t extinguish itself until it burns your target to ashes. This is no ordinary elemental talent. This is a crushing defeat at the level of loss. The audience below the stage was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Am I on the wrong set? Is this a martial arts competition or is this a battle of gods? Was that fire fist ace just now and now it&#x27;s a kynu? Did Shin Yuan eat the comic book? Why are all these powerful moves like this? That&#x27;s too brutal. Goddess Chin is about to cry. Who said F-class is trash? If it&#x27;s trash, then what am I? A parramium on the player&#x27;s bench. Xiao Hongi looked at Shun Yuan on the stage who was like a demon god and her hand holding the spear trembled with excitement. She had previously thought that the only difference between her and Shin Yuan was their strength.</p>
<p>Now it seems this guy is hiding his true colors. Xiao Hongi bit her lip. On the other side, Akasha, however, was so excited that her face turned bright red. She looked at Shun Yuan&#x27;s figure, which was dominating the battlefield. Her purple eyes filled with admiration.</p>
<p>Dragon Lord, so hot and fierce. That&#x27;s how I completely melted that pretentious woman&#x27;s heart. On the arena, Chinua had been cornered. The surrounding area was filled with flowing lava and scorched ground. Her white dress was now filthy, covered in burn marks.</p>
<p>That exquisitly beautiful face was now covered in dust, making her appear exceptionally poignant. Admit defeat. Shin Yuan hovered in midair, standing on two bursts of flame, looking down at her. If you keep fighting, you&#x27;ll lose your clothes. I don&#x27;t care if hundreds of billions of people are watching me, but I&#x27;m afraid you, Miss Chin, will lose face.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans words sounded like he was asking for a beating, but they were indeed the truth. Chinua is currently at her last gasp. Hearing the words, &quot;Admit defeat, Shinu&#x27;s somewhat flustered eyes suddenly became incredibly calm. That calmness is not giving up. It was the calm before the storm.&quot; She looked up at Shinuan in the sky.</p>
<p>A rare, chillingly beautiful sneer appeared on his face. Admit defeat. Shinuan, you underestimate me. They&#x27;ve seriously underestimated theQin family. Chapter 186.</p>
<p>Ice Phoenix Rebirth vs. Fiery Dragon Desends. Spanking. Underestimating theQin family. Shin Yuan raised an eyebrow, looking at Chin Schwe&#x27;s face, which was gradually becoming transparent and even somewhat unreal.</p>
<p>And his heart skipped a beat for no reason. Something&#x27;s off about this girl. The temperature inside the arena, which had been baked like a steamer by a sea of lava, was now filled with a chilling aura that made one&#x27;s soul tremble. That kind of cold wasn&#x27;t a physical cooling, but a deathly stillness where everything withered. Buzz.</p>
<p>Chinua had already closed her eyes. Her once jet black hair turned pure silver white at a speed visible to the naked eye. Each strand of hair was like a thread drawn from extremely cold ice crystals, dancing wildly in a heat wave, yet untouched by any trace of worldly dust. Her bare feet dangled in the air, the scorched earth beneath her feet covered with a thick layer of mysterious ice. The ice was not transparent, but a deep dark blue, like a deep sea frozen for 10,000 years.</p>
<p>That is Juan Nongying, who was still watching the show with her legs crossed in the sky, suddenly stood up and crushed the folding fan in her hand with a snap. A bloodline reversion. No, this is the rudimentary form of a dharma body. Juan Nomiings voice carried a hint of disbelief and shock. He&#x27;s only at the mid-stage of the fifth realm.</p>
<p>Yet, he&#x27;s already touched upon the laws and dharma forms that only a ninth realm demigod can comprehend. This girl&#x27;s comprehension is even more extraordinary than that of a prodigy. The two male mentors next to him were so shocked their jaws almost dropped to the floor. A natural-born dharma aspect. This is a once in a millennium talent even in the main campus of the domain academy.</p>
<p>If Chinua were to enter the elemental tower, wouldn&#x27;t those old charlatans fight tooth and nail to snatch her away? Not only were the celestial mentors stunned, but the audience on Earth were also dumbfounded. They don&#x27;t understand the concept of dharma form or not, but it&#x27;s a suppression from the level of life and it can&#x27;t be faked. At this moment, Chinua was no longer an ordinary girl. She is more like an ice and snow deity who stepped out of ancient mythology. Noble, aloof, and inviable.</p>
<p>Shinyuan Chinua opened her eyes. What kind of eyes were those? There were no whites in their eyes, no pupils, only two swirling, eerie blue storms that seemed capable of sucking in and freezing a person&#x27;s soul. Her voice also changed, becoming ethereal and layered, carrying a divine quality that made people want to worship her. Your flames before the true laws of extreme cold. It is but a wisp of candle light in the mortal world.</p>
<p>Ice Phoenix, Nirvana, true form, boom dash. As her words fell, a gigantic ice phoenix phantom with a wingspan of over a 100 meters suddenly condensed in the void behind Chinua. This is no longer the energy mimicry of the past. It has been transformed into a lielike entity with even the patterns on every feather clearly visible. The ice phoenix let out a loud cry that pierced through the barrier and exploded in everyone&#x27;s mind.</p>
<p>Inside the arena, the churning crimson magma surprisingly cooled and solidified rapidly at an eerie speed amidst this roar, eventually turning into chunks of black stone. Shinuan, who had just held an absolute advantage, was forced to retreat step by step, and the fire shield on his body became shaky under the extreme cold. Goodness, Shinuan rubbed the goosebumps that had appeared on his arms and exhaled a puff of white breath. Is this the complete form of an SSS level talent? It&#x27;s definitely something special. He looked at Chin Schwa, who was like a goddess in midair, and grinned.</p>
<p>That smile held a kind of excitement that was hard to decipher. But Chen, the school beauty, your transformation is quite beautiful. But what if this actually hurts you? I would feel sorry for you. Arrogant Chinu, or rather the will of the ice phoenix, snorted coldly, raised her right hand, and pointed at Shu Yuan from afar. Winter has come, and all things have come to an end.</p>
<p>call. With a flap of its wings, the enormous ice phoenix unleashed countless ice swords, each carrying the power of the law to destroy everything as they poured down upon Shun Yuan. These are not ordinary ice swords. Each sword is imbued with an extreme cold law that can freeze vital energy and even mind. There&#x27;s no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>You want me to end this? Shun Yuan felt a surge of excitement. His chest swelled and a series of booming sounds like muffled thunder emanated from within him. That&#x27;s the sound of the heart working at high capacity. The S-rank undying dragon blood boiled, pushing every inch of his blood vessels to their limit. The SS rank undying flame soul unleashed its full power, converting all the vital energy within his body into the most violent fuel.</p>
<p>What I hate most in this life is being bossed around and told what to do. Shin Yuan suddenly looked up and his eyes, which were originally golden, were instantly replaced by crimson flames. Since you&#x27;re the ice phoenix, then I&#x27;ll play the part today. The fiery dragon that slays the phoenix. Rumble.</p>
<p>Shin yuans body remained unchanged, but a huge phantom appeared in the void behind him. That&#x27;s not long, Shiao. That purplish blue mudfish. Instead, it was a hellfire dragon whose body was covered in crimson magma, had wings on its back, and a ferocious face like an ancient demon god. This was the first time Shin Yuan had completely fused his dual talents in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Fiery dragon, heaven burning transformation. Roar dash, a dragon&#x27;s roar, even more doineering and ferocious than that of the ice phoenix, shattered the swirling snow and wind. The infernal dragon opened its blood red m, unleashing a crimson gold dragon breath powerful enough to melt the void, flowing upstream against the sky full of ice swords. Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle. A clash between ice and fire, a battle between law and brute force.</p>
<p>The entire Dragon Nest arena has been transformed into a frozen hell on one side and a blazing inferno on the other. At the junction in the middle, water vapor exploded, forming a huge mushroom cloud that shot straight up to the dome. Oh my god. Quick, open the protective shield. Top level.</p>
<p>Su Xiao Yao was so frightened that she threw down the microphone and desperately flew upwards. The energy fluctuations below were terrifying. If she, a being of the fourth realm, were to be affected, she would be reduced to ashes in less than a second. In the stands, countless spectators scattered in panic, their hands covering their heads. The protective shield creaked under the strain, cracking everywhere.</p>
<p>This is the fifth realm. Are these two going to tear down the capital? Shinuan actually blocked it. That was an SSS level law dharma image. The smoke and dust cleared. The arena has long since vanished, leaving behind a bottomless crater.</p>
<p>Bottom of the pit. Chin Schwa hovered in midair. The elucory image of the ice phoenix behind her dimmed considerably, and her silver white face became paler. Shinuan, he stood on a boulder at the bottom of the pit, his trench coat long since turned to ashes, revealing his muscular upper body. His muscles were clearly defined, covered with crimson dragon scale patterns, and in some places they were even emitting blue smoke.</p>
<p>He chuckled, panting, &quot;What? Haven&#x27;t you eaten?&quot; Shin Yuan shook his slightly numb arm and looked at Chinua in the sky. This little bit of cold isn&#x27;t even enough to cool me down. Chapter 187. Ice Phoenix Rebirth vs. Fiery Dragon Descends.</p>
<p>A severe punishment. Chinua was not convinced. She formed a hand seal and the elucory ice phoenix behind her began to burn. Burning its life force. Extreme cold forbidden technique.</p>
<p>Absolute zero. She transformed into a streak of silver white light, abandoning all ranged attacks and charged straight at Shin Yuan. She actually used her own body as the sharpest ice blade to pierce through this man&#x27;s dharma form. Good timing. Shinuan pushed off with both legs and charged forward.</p>
<p>The most primitive and savage form of hand-to-hand combat. Bang! Bang! Bang! In midair, two figures, one red and one white, collided violently. Each collision triggering a violent energy storm. Chinu&#x27;s attack carried a chilling aura, aiming to freeze Shinuan&#x27;s blood. Shin Yuans every punch was imbued with a heat powerful enough to incinerate gold and boil the sea, aiming to shatter Chin Schwe ice armor.</p>
<p>Get down here, you bastard. Shin Yuan withtood Chin Schwe icy palm strike, and a thick layer of frost instantly formed on his left shoulder, but he didn&#x27;t even flinch. His right hand moved with lightning speed, grabbing Chin Schwe&#x27;s ankle. That ankle was slender and cold, and the feel of holding it was like grasping a piece of ancient ice. Got you.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuans eyes flashed with a fierce light. Open. Shinua was terrified and tried to break free. Shinyuans hand remained completely still. You were so good at flying just now.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s see where you run to. Shin Yuan used his waist to exert force, making a large swing in the air as if you were swinging a sledgehammer and slammed Chin Shu hard onto the ground. Boom! Chin Schwe&#x27;s delicate body crashed heavily to the bottom of the pit, creating a large human-shaped crater. Before she could react, Shinuan had already descended from the sky and sat down on her waist. This posture extremely indecent, extremely ambiguous, extremely shameful.</p>
<p>Shinuan, you bastard. Chin Schwe&#x27;s perpetually icy face flushed Crimson. She was both furious and incredibly ashamed. She struggled desperately and the elucory ice phoenix behind her tried to protect its master, but it was suppressed by the crimson gold dragon flames erupting from Shan Yuan&#x27;s body. Asshel Shin Yuan pinned her flailing hands above his head, pinning them firmly to the ground.</p>
<p>The entire audience of 100,000 people was petrified. The chat in the live stream paused for 3 seconds. Chin Schwe froze completely. She is the eldest daughter of theQin family, an SSS level ice phoenix pride, and the disciple of the Jade exquisite war god, one of the five marshall emperors of the ice phoenix empire. In front of billions of people, he was actually defeated and humiliated by a single man.</p>
<p>This slap is to teach you not to always have that long face like someone owes you 8 million. Shin Yuans voice was fierce, but there was little murderous intent in his eyes. This slap is to let you know who your future man is. Chin Schwez eyes reen that lofty divinity crumbled leaving only the grievances and shame of a mortal girl. The silver white color on her body quickly faded.</p>
<p>Her hair turned back to black and her terrifying dark blue storm eyes returned to their normal iceb blue pupils. Two glistening tears still clung to the corners of her eyes. Ugg. A suppressed sob escaped from her throat. The laws lifted.</p>
<p>She lost. They lost completely. Losing everything both inside and out. She never imagined that one day she would be defeated in public by a boy whose talent and comprehension were inferior to hers. This man even got revenge for rejecting her confession that day.</p>
<p>As Shin Yuan looked at Shin Shu, who was no longer a goddess, but a little woman who could cry and feel pain, the sadistic sense of revenge in his heart slowly subsided. He released his grip on Chin Shu&#x27;s hands, rolled off her, and laid down on the still warm stone beside her. Gasping for breath, he looked up at the dome above him, torn apart by the energy storm, revealing a patch of blue sky. So, are you convinced or not? Shinuan turned his head and looked at Chin Shu, who was still sobbing. He reached out his hand, wanting to wipe away her tears.</p>
<p>This time, Chinua neither dodged nor released any cold energy. She just bit her lip coldly, glaring at him with eyes that seemed to want to bite him to death. But deep within those eyes, besides hatred, there seemed to be something else. After her pride was shattered, she was forced to confront the complexity of this man. Shinuan Shinw&#x27;s voice was, still tinged with the sobs of her heart.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve noted this down. You&#x27;re welcome to come and settle your accounts anytime. Shinuan chuckled, but next time I come, it won&#x27;t be that simple. At that time, Shinuan leaned close to her ear and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll show you what it truly means to experience both extremes of heat and cold.&quot; Chin Schwe trembled, her ears turning bright red. &quot;Abnormal!&quot; she cursed, but didn&#x27;t make another move.</p>
<p>She just struggled to her feet, straightened her disheveled skirt, and limped off the stage. His back view remained aloof, but his gate seemed somewhat unnatural. Shin Yuan Shan of the East Sea. Su Xia Yao practically shouted those words in a trembling voice. There was a two-c silence followed by a burst of cheers and whistles loud enough to lift the roof off.</p>
<p>Awesome. All I can say is awesome. Even the ice phoenix goddess dares to attack Shin Yuan, a role model for us all. This isn&#x27;t a competition. It&#x27;s a scene of mass domestic violence.</p>
<p>But why do I feel like we could ship them? Oh no. I saw the look in Goddess Chin&#x27;s eyes when she left. She was clearly a little tempted. On the podium, Huan Nonging sat back down in her chair, and a new folding fan appeared in her hand. At some point, she looked at the man receiving cheers on the ring, her eyes gleaming with greed.</p>
<p>&quot;Good lad, even this fierce wild horse can be tamed. It seems I can confidently increase the difficulty of this course on primitive evolution by several levels.&quot; She licked her red lips, her gaze intense. &quot;When you arrive at the domain academy, your teacher has prepared a lot of fun games.&quot; Shin Yuan stood in the center of the arena, basking in the glory of victory. But he didn&#x27;t show much excitement because this is only the semi-final. The real highlight is yet to come.</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at the other side of the player&#x27;s bench. There, Ziao Hongi stood holding a long spear like a mother leopard poised to pounce, her eyes fixed on him with fervent intensity. Only the two of us are left in the final four. Shinuan beckoned to her with his finger. A female warrior.</p>
<p>Bring it on. Let me see just how tough your gun really is. Shinuan, don&#x27;t think you can act with impunity just because you defeated Chinua. Xiao Hongi leaped onto the arena with a whoosh, her red armor clanging loudly with each movement. Her chest heaved violently, clearly still reeling from the scene of Shun Yuan abusing Chinua.</p>
<p>I felt ashamed, but also inexplicably a little hot. Chinua is a mage. Her body is fragile. I&#x27;m a warrior. Xiao Hongi slammed her spear into the ground and the alloy floor instantly cracked in several places.</p>
<p>You want to hit me? You&#x27;d better ask the gun in my hand first. Chapter 188. The mad Valkyrie using Shin Yuan as a punching bag. Hey referee, stop doawling. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s black and gold spear slammed heavily on the ground, causing the alloy arena to emit a teeth grinding groan.</p>
<p>Her phoenix eyes burned with a palpable fighting spirit. She didn&#x27;t even look at Su Xia Yao, but instead locked onto Shun Yuan&#x27;s throat. I was in a hurry, and so was he. The sooner we finished the treatment, the sooner we could get him to the ICU, so he wouldn&#x27;t be in the way on stage. Su Xiao Yao flapped her somewhat stiff pink wings, sweating profusely with anxiety.</p>
<p>She glanced at the ravaged arena, then at Shun Yuan, who was still steaming from his demolition battle with Chinua. Her professional ethics compelled her to raise the microphone. Those two contestants, please wait a moment. Su Xiao stealed herself and stood between the two, her voice booming through the loudspeaker. According to the competition rules, Shin Yuan has just finished a highintensity semi-final and is extremely exhausted.</p>
<p>To ensure the fairness of the final, the organizing committee recommends granting Shun Yuan half an hour to rest and recover. Rest? Xiao Hongi scoffed. Her dark red armor gleamed with a cold metallic luster in the sunlight, making her voluuptuous figure appear even more aggressive. I have no objection. What&#x27;s wrong with giving him half a day, let alone half an hour? Itll save us from saying, I, Xiao Hongi, bully a  if we lose later.</p>
<p>Need not, a lazy voice interrupted Su Xiao, who was about to argue. Shin Yuan casually tore off the trench coat, which had turned into strips of cloth, and threw it aside, revealing his strong upper body covered with dark dragon scale patterns. He stretched his neck, and his knuckles cracked like popping beans. Hosu, do you have some misunderstanding about the term real man? Shinyuan walked up to Su Xiao Yao, his dark eyes showing no sign of fatigue, but rather flickering with excitement. He reached out and shoved Su Xiao Yao, who was blocking his way, aside like picking up a chick, and flicked her pink pigtails.</p>
<p>A real man never needs to rest. My time is very precious. There&#x27;s soup simmering at home. Shiny Yuan grinned at Xiao Hongi. A smile so arrogant it made you want to slap him in the face.</p>
<p>Hurry up. Don&#x27;t keep this woman waiting. I think her gun is itching to get going. Su Xiaoa rolled her eyes, speechless. Well, her good intentions were completely wasted.</p>
<p>Fine, since you&#x27;re all in such a hurry to be reborn, then I won&#x27;t stop you.&quot; Su Xiao Yao flew angrily into the sky, waving her command flag down sharply. The Imperial Prodigy Tournament Grand Finals begin. Boom dash. Before she finished speaking, Xiao Hongs figure had already disappeared from the spot. There was no probing, no idle chatter.</p>
<p>She was like a cannon shot, instantly blasting a 2 m diameter crater into the alloy floor beneath her feet. Using this terrifying recoil, she and her gun transformed into a red lightning bolt, instantly closing in on Shun Yuan&#x27;s face. Die. The black and gold spear accompanied by a shrill sonic boom spun at its tip, shattering the air, and aimed straight for Shun Yuan&#x27;s brow. This shot was incredibly fast and incredibly ruthless.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan&#x27;s pupils contracted slightly. Wow, so fast. Faster than any of its predecessors. And it&#x27;s not just about speed. It&#x27;s about momentum.</p>
<p>A force that leaves one with no way to avoid it and no choice but to confront it head-on. Open it for me. Instead of retreating, Shin Yuan advanced, his right arm instantly covered in crimson gold dragon scales, and he punched the tip of the spear. Clang dash. The clanging of metal was so loud it hurt the eardrums of the audience in the front row.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan felt a drilling force rush from his fist straight to his shoulder, and he was so shocked that he slid backwards several meters, leaving two deep grooves in the ground with his feet. Xiao Hongi merely flicked her wrist, dissipating the force of the recoil. Is that all the strength you have? Xiao Hongi flipped her wrist and her spear moved like a snake spitting its tongue, instantly changing her move. Northern warfare tactics. Chaotic cloak.</p>
<p>Swish, swish, swish, dash. A hail of gunfire instantly enveloped Shinuan. This is no longer a simple contest of strength, but a crushing victory of skill. Xiao Hongs spear seemed to come alive in her hands. Sometimes striking like a heavy hammer, sometimes like a venomous snake piercing the heart, and sometimes like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x27;t using ordinary martial arts techniques, but rather the combat methods she had honed in the northern borderlands amidst mountains of corpses and seas of blood, fighting against countless highlevel star beasts. Every move was aimed at killing. Huff, puff, puff. In just a few seconds, Shinuan had seven or eight bloody holes in his body. Even with the protection of Sgrade dragon blood, which avoided vital points, blood still gushed out as if it were free.</p>
<p>Hide. Where do you think you can hide? Xiao Hongi became more and more excited as she fought. Her eyes practically glowing red. She used her spear to break through Shan Yuan&#x27;s defenses, and the shaft of the spear struck Shin Yuan&#x27;s waist heavily. Bang! Shin Yuan was sent flying, crashing into a broken stone pillar and shattering it into pieces.</p>
<p>Cough, cough. Shinyuan climbed out of the pile of rubble and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. Pain. It really hurts. That woman is really ruthless.</p>
<p>Each shot carried a unique spiraling energy that penetrated the flesh and damaged the meridians, making it far more troublesome than L Yings simple and brutal fists and feet. But Shin Yuan glanced down at the wounds on his body that were healing at a visible speed, and his smile widened even more. &quot;Cool.&quot; He roared and charged forward again. &quot;Again? Didn&#x27;t you eat? Give it your all.&quot; Xiao Hongi frowned. Is this bastard a cockroach? Those shots would have killed an ordinary mid-stage fifth realm cultivator long ago.</p>
<p>But this guy want to die? Fine. Xiao Hongi let out a delicate shout, and the red armor on her body shone brightly. She held nothing back, unleashing the full power of her peak fifth realm aura. A bewitching red lotus phantom bloomed on her spear. Red lotus blaze.</p>
<p>A hundred birds pay homage to the phoenix. Countless spear beams transformed into firebirds, crashing down on Shin Yuan like a tidal wave. Shinuan didn&#x27;t dodge at all. Like a madman, he braved a hail of bullets, taking Xiao Hongi&#x27;s attacks head-on with his body and then seized the opportunity to deliver a punch and a kick. The spear pierced Shin Yuan&#x27;s left shoulder, pinning him to the ground.</p>
<p>Gotcha. Shin Yuan seemed oblivious to the pain, gripping the spear shaft tightly with his other hand. His right hand transformed into a dragon claw, wreathed in crimson gold flames, and viciously clawed at Xiao Hongs chest. roll. Xiao Hongi was shocked and had no choice but to abandon her gun and retreat, kicking Shinuan in the chest to bounce off.</p>
<p>Shinuan pulled the spear from his shoulder and tossed it aside. The granulation tissue at the wound ride wildly, and the bleeding stopped in the blink of an eye. He licked his lips, his golden vertical pupils filled with a wild animalistic excitement. Keep going, Goddess of War. The pressure of your massage is just right.</p>
<p>Chapter 189. Everyone is shocked. Is this guy an unkillable cockroach? Inside the Dragon&#x27;s Nest arena, the 100,000 spectators were completely silent. Everyone stared wideeyed at the man on the stage, covered in blood, yet growing stronger with each battle. Is this still a competition? This is not just one-sided torture, it&#x27;s one-sided massochism.</p>
<p>Xiao Hong&#x27;s marksmanship is too strong. So strong that it makes people despair. Whether in speed, strength, or skill, he completely overwhelmed Shinuan. But Shinuan was too stubborn. They&#x27;re incredibly resilient.</p>
<p>What is this kid&#x27;s body made of? On the contestant&#x27;s bench, Taiishan, who had already been eliminated, touched his bald head, which was still throbbing slightly, and looked at him with a ghostly expression. If this humble monk&#x27;s indestructible body had taken so many bullets, it would have deflated long ago. How come he&#x27;s acting like nothing happened? Beside him, Longhos face was so gloomy it could drip water. Even the royal family of star beasts wouldn&#x27;t possess such regenerative abilities. Just what kind of monster is Shin Yuan? East China Sea Theater Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s underground command center.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was so heavy it was suffocating on the big screen. Every time Shin Yuan was pierced by the spear, Lynn Sharons face pald a little more. Stop hitting me, please stop. Lynn Sharon covered her mouth, tears streaming down her face, huddled on the sofa, trembling. Shinyuan is bleeding so much he&#x27;s going to die.</p>
<p>Natasha was calmer than Lin Churin, but the knuckles of her hand gripping the pillow were white from excessive force. Stupid master. She bit her red lips, her purple eyes filled with anxiety. Why did she have to fight that crazy woman hand to hand when she could have used flames to create distance and wear her down? Was she asking for trouble? Only Su Ching Zhu remained seated at the control panel. She pushed up her gold rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>The rapidly flashing data on the lenses reflecting her beautiful, calm, almost cold eyes. &quot;Don&#x27;t cry,&quot; Such Chingus voice was cool and clear, yet it carried a reassuring power. &quot;Look at the data carefully.&quot; Her slender fingers swept across the light screen, bringing up a monitoring chart of Shun Yuan&#x27;s bodily functions. His heart rate, blood pressure, and adrenaline levels, while high, were very stable. Most importantly, Such Ching Zu pointed to the curve representing cell activity.</p>
<p>a hint of fanaticism flashing in her eyes. His cell division rate increased by 300% compared to before the competition started. He was using Xiao Hongs attacks to forcibly tear muscle fibers and then using dragon blood to rebuild them. This is not a beating at all. Su Ching Xus lips curled into a cunning smile.</p>
<p>This was a highly efficient blacksmithing exercise. Xiao Hongi was merely a free blacksmith to him. next to fortress 1. Inside Fortress 2, Mu Wan Bing sat in front of the huge floor toseeiling window holding a cup of coffee that had long since gone cold. She did not go to the scene, but the holographic projection in front of them occupied the entire wall.</p>
<p>Looking at the bloodcovered man in the picture, Mu Wan Bings face, which had been frozen for more than 20 years, once again showed a look of panic. &quot;Madman,&quot; she muttered a curse under her breath, her voice trembling slightly. She remembered the bet. If I win the championship, you can&#x27;t interfere in my relationship with your sister. At the time, she thought it was just a joke.</p>
<p>But now, looking at that figure who would never fall, even if he was covered in wounds, Mu Wan Bings heart began to pound uncontrollably. Do you really want to win? Would you risk your life for that so-called promise? For some reason, the thought that Shin Yuan was working so hard to marry Muing Shua made Mu Wan Bing feel a pang of bitterness. It felt like someone had taken away your favorite toy. If you lose, Mu Wan Bings fingers unconsciously rubbed the rim of the glass. If you lose, does that mean you don&#x27;t have to marry her? So can I.</p>
<p>Above the dragon&#x27;s nest, deep in the clouds, inside that invisible silver worship, Huan Nonging leaned back in the command chair, waving a folding fan in her hand, her peach blossom eyes fixed on the arena below. Wow, that little body is really sturdy. She licked her red lips, her greedy gaze undisguised. That little girl from the Xiao family is indeed quite skilled with a gun. She&#x27;s already reached the threshold of mastery.</p>
<p>The bearded instructor beside him said in a deep voice. Instructor Hua, although Shin Yuan can take a beating, it&#x27;s not a long-term solution for him to keep passively taking hits. The difference in skill is too great. He can&#x27;t win by brute force alone. You don&#x27;t know anything.</p>
<p>Juan Nonging rolled her eyes at him, gently tapping the armrest with her folding fan. Look closely at his eyes. The two male instructors were taken aback and quickly zoomed in on the image. Shin Yuans golden vertical pupils were bloodshot, yet unusually clear. His gaze wasn&#x27;t fixed on Xiao Hongs face, but rather on the gun in her hand.</p>
<p>The trajectory of each shot she made and the muscles she used to exert force. He is studying. Huan Nongyings voice carried a hint of amazement. He was using his body to memorize Xiao Hongs fighting style and using dragon blood to analyze her power generation techniques. This abnormal learning ability coupled with that indestructible body, Huan Nonging took a deep breath, her full breasts rising and falling with it.</p>
<p>This kid is a born war god on the arena. The battle has reached a fever pitch. Xiao Hongi was a little out of breath. She had been delivering highintensity output for a full 10 minutes. Even someone made of iron would get tired wielding a spear weighing hundreds of kilograms.</p>
<p>But Shin Yuan on the other side, apart from his clothes being a little torn and blood being drawn, actually had more energy and spirit than before. You monster. Xiao Hongi gritted her teeth, feeling the spear in her hand grow heavy, she forced Shinuan back with a single shot, creating distance between them, her chest heaving violently. Shinuan, what can you do besides take a beating like a turtle? Xiao Hongi roared. If you&#x27;re so capable, fight me head on.</p>
<p>What kind of skill is it to rely on thick skin? A counteroffensive? Shin Yuan wiped the blood from his face, which made him look particularly ferocious, yet also exuded a kind of evil and madness. He didn&#x27;t rush forward, but stood still and closed his eyes. Countless images flashed through my mind. Xiao Hongs actions of drawing and retracting the gun, flicking her wrist, and exerting force. Every movement was broken down into the most basic lines by the super strong perception granted by the S-class dragon blood.</p>
<p>In addition, the blood control talent he received from Akasha call. Shinyuan let out a long breath. He suddenly opened his eyes within those golden vertical pupils. It seemed as if two long spears were practicing their techniques in a crossfire. Xiao Hongi.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t you say I don&#x27;t know anything about marksmanship? Shinyuan grinned, revealing a set of gleaming white teeth. He slowly raised his right hand, palm facing upward. Then let me show you what my gun is all about. Buzz. The dragon blood that had been boiling within Shu Yuan suddenly quieted down.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, the blood stopped flowing from his still unhealed wounds and began to float up strangely. One drop, two drops, countless drops. The blood gathered, fused, and compressed in the air. At the same time, a burst of crimson gold dragon energy erupted from Shun Yuan&#x27;s palm and merged into the blood. Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle, accompanied by a tooth grinding sound of energy compression.</p>
<p>Amidst the horrified gazes of the entire audience of 100,000, a long spear, entirely crimson, seemingly crafted from red crystal with golden magma flowing within, took shape in Shun Yuan&#x27;s hands. This spear is 2 m long, its body covered with ferocious dragon scale patterns, and its tip is as sharp as a dragon&#x27;s tooth, radiating a chilling bloody stench and intense heat. What is this? Xiao Hongs pupils contracted sharply, and her hand holding the black and gold spear trembled slightly. Is that primordial energy taking form? No, that was a physical object forcibly condensed using its own essence and dragon energy. Sorry, that was during study time.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan gripped the crimson dragon spear with one hand and casually twirled it. His movements were clumsy, yet they possessed a natural and doineering quality. He pointed the tip of his gun directly at Xiao Hongi. His smile both playful and dangerous. Class is over now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to hand in the assignment. Teacher Xiao, please enlighten me. Chapter 190. Learning on the spot. This prodigy saw the female war goddess naked.</p>
<p>Crimson dragon spear. All flash and no substance. Xiao Hongi sneered and with a sudden jerk, the black and gold spear in her hand trembled. The tip of the spear emitting several deadly spear flowers. She simply couldn&#x27;t believe that a guy who only knew how to throw punches with brute force could learn to use a gun in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not only a desecration of martial arts, but also an insult to the Xiao family&#x27;s century old spear technique. Whether it&#x27;s just for show or not, you&#x27;ll know once you try it.&quot; Shun Yuan grinned and the crimson spear in his hand formed from blood and dragon energy, even twirled in a flourish. His movements were slightly awkward, even comical, like a tiger trying to be a tiger, but ending up with a dog. But the menacing aura he exuded was undeniable. Court death.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi stopped talking and pushed off with her feet, quickly closing the 20 m gap. Northern spear technique, piercing the sun. This shot had no fancy tricks. It was just extreme speed and extreme directness. The spear tip tore through the air with a sharp bang, aiming straight for Shun Yuan&#x27;s heart.</p>
<p>Shinyuan&#x27;s pupils contracted slightly. In his vision, this shot was no longer a simple thrust. But the trajectory of countless muscle fibers exerting force, a route map of vital energy surging through the meridians. The S-rank undying dragon blood granted him beast-like intuition, and the blood control he had just obtained from Akasha allowed him to have a thorough understanding of the flow ofQi and blood within Xiao Hongs body. &quot;Too straightforward,&quot; Shin Yuan murmured something, and instead of parrying, he slid the crimson dragon spear to the side in an extremely strange way, the shaft of the spear touching the black and gold spear shaft, and twisted it in the process.</p>
<p>The sticky technique, sizzle, sizzle, sizzle. The two spears clashed violently, sparks flying everywhere. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s shot, which was originally meant to kill, was deflected by the sticky force by 3 in, grazing Shin Yuan&#x27;s ribs and missing its mark. Um, Xiao Hongi&#x27;s beautiful eyes widened, her heart filled with turmoil. How is that possible? This sticky spear technique is a closely guarded secret of northern spear fighting.</p>
<p>used to deflect force. It emphasizes the suppleness of the wrist and precise control of power. This kid clearly couldn&#x27;t even hold a spear properly. How could he possibly pull this off? Before she could react, Shin Yuan flicked his wrist and the crimson dragon spear sprang up as if it were alive, its tail whipping like a venomous snake, striking fiercely towards Xiao Hongs temple. A surprise attack.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi felt a chill run down her spine and instinctively raised her black and gold spear to block. when a crisp sound. Xiao Hongi was so shaken that she slid backwards several meters, her hands and feet going numb. She stared intently at Shin Yuan as if she were seeing this man for the first time. You You stole my marksmanship.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan toyed with the bloodstained spear in his hand, whistled, and said with a roguish look, &quot;How can a scholar&#x27;s actions be called stealing? This is called learning from others strengths and making up for one&#x27;s own weaknesses. Besides, you just poked so many holes in me. What&#x27;s wrong with me learning a couple of tricks from you? It&#x27;s called reciprocity, Xiao Hongi laughed in anger, her red armor shining brightly, her fighting spirit increasing rather than decreasing. Fine, since you want to learn, then I&#x27;ll teach you as much as I can. Let&#x27;s see if your life is enough to pay the tuition.</p>
<p>Boom! Xiao Hongi charged forward again. This time, her marksmanship changed. It is no longer a straightforward military tactic, but has become unpredictable and unpredictable like a sudden storm, leaving no room for error. A disheveled cloak, three variations on plum blossom, sweep through the enemy ranks. A hail of gunfire completely enveloped Shinuan.</p>
<p>The audience below the stage was dazzled and dared not even breathe. Oh no, Goddess Xiao is serious. This is the Xiao family secret technique. Shin Yuan has overestimated himself this time. Exactly.</p>
<p>Learning something new and applying it on the spot isn&#x27;t that easy. Do you really think you&#x27;re a martial arts prodigy? However, as time went on, everyone&#x27;s jaws nearly dropped to the floor. On the arena, Shinuan was like a dry sponge that had been thrown into water. At first, he seemed flustered in the face of Xiao Hongi&#x27;s offensive, and a few more bloody marks appeared on his body. But gradually, his actions changed from novice to expert.</p>
<p>From being passively attacked to being able to fight back. Even at the very end, his shooting angle and power technique were exactly the same as Xiao Hongs. Plang plang clang. The two spears collided wildly in the air, each impact like a reflection in a mirror. Xiao Hongi thrust out a poison dragon drill and Shinuan countered with a divine dragon tail swing.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi used the collapse technique to smash down and Shin Yuan used the pick technique to withstand it. Is this some kind of learning while playing game? On the contestant stand, Yigi Yun, who had already been eliminated, almost dropped his newly acquired sword in fright as he looked at the two figures entangled on the stage. Is this level of understanding, even human? Chinu sat beside her, her icy blue eyes also filled with shock. When she lost to Shin Yuan, she thought it was because of the difference in strength and attributed advantage. But now, it seems that what&#x27;s most terrifying about this man isn&#x27;t dragon blood or flames at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s this abnormal learning ability that allows you to strip someone bare. No, strip them bare of all their secrets with just one glance. A monster. Chin Schweb bit her lower lip and uttered the two words in a low voice above the clouds. Huan Nongying stopped waving her folding fan, her peach blossom, eyes shining brightly as if she wanted to swallow Shun Yuan whole.</p>
<p>Good lad. His S-rank dragon blood enhanced his physical memory, and his blood control allowed him to grasp the techniques of exerting force. In addition, he possessed dragon eyes that could see through illusions. This isn&#x27;t a fight. It&#x27;s clearly using the other person as a sparring partner to escalate the situation.</p>
<p>If such a genius were to join my primitive evolutionary school, with a little training, even the personal disciples of those old monsters would be crushed by him. on the arena. After another violent collision, the two separated almost immediately after getting together. Xiao Hongi was panting heavily. Her red armor was soaked with sweat and clung tightly to her body, outlining her voluuptuous curves.</p>
<p>Looking at the energetic man opposite her, who was even getting more and more excited as the fight went on. The contempt in her eyes completely disappeared. Her face was solemn, but her beautiful eyes revealed her recognition of the strong. Shinuan Xiao Hongi slammed her spear on the ground, her voice yet carrying a metallic quality. I take back what I said earlier.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not a freeloader, nor are you a good for nothing who only knows how to talk big. She raised her head, her phoenix eyes burning with fierce fire. To be able to learn almost all of my marksmanship in such a short time, no matter what methods you used, that takes skill. You are a real man. He is also a worthy opponent.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Shin Yuan slung the bloodstained spear over his shoulder and said with a grin, &quot;What has the woman in red been beaten into submission? Is she ready to offer herself to him? Dream!&quot; Xiao Hongi snorted coldly, but this time she did not fly into a rage because of Shin Yuans teasing. She slowly closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and regulated the somewhat disordered breathing within her body. When she opened her eyes again, her aura had changed. It was no longer that raging outward fiery flame. Rather, it is a restrained profound volcano seemingly poised to erupt at any moment.</p>
<p>Since you learn so quickly, let me see. Xiao Hongi gripped the gun barrel with both hands, squatted slightly, and assumed an extremely strange starting stance. How much of this trick can you learn? Buzz. As she moved, the black and gold spears suddenly trembled with a mournful cry. A tragic and resolute aura erupted from Ziao Hongi.</p>
<p>Man and gun become one. She seemed to have vanished, leaving only that gun in the world. Shinuan, don&#x27;t blame me for not warning you. Xiao Hongs voice became ethereal, as if it came from all directions. This skill was something I learned when I killed a sixth realm beast king in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Its name is burial, Crimson Lotus. If you can&#x27;t catch it, you&#x27;ll die. Shin Yuan&#x27;s playful smile finally disappeared. He could sense that this move was different. This is no longer just a skill, but a manifestation of will.</p>
<p>A resolute will to burn everything in front of you to ashes. Are you serious? Shin Yuans golden vertical pupils instantly contracted to needle-like shapes. He did not adopt the same starting stance as before. Because he can&#x27;t learn this move. This is the path that Xiao Hani risked her life for.</p>
<p>Since you&#x27;re going to work so hard, I can&#x27;t be too preuncter. Shin Yuan released the crimson dragon spear from his hand. The blood reintegrated into his body. He stood there empty-handed. His muscles began to tremble with a strange rhythm, and the golden dragon scale patterns under his skin flashed wildly, as if something was about to burst out of his body.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, Xiao Hongi.&quot; Shin Yuan stretched out a hand and beckoned to the Grim Reaper&#x27;s spear that was poised to fire. Chapter 1 191. Force can overcome technique. Breakthrough. Burial.</p>
<p>Crimson Lotus. Kill. With Xiao Hongi&#x27;s sharp shout, the air in the entire Dragon Nest arena seemed to be sucked out. In that instant, the world lost its color. There was only one red light.</p>
<p>A red light that condensed all of Xiao Hongi&#x27;s essence, energy, and spirit, and even burned her primordial life force. The red light, like a blood red lotus blooming in purgatory with a poignant yet deadly ark, instantly traversed the distance of space. Quick. It&#x27;s almost at its limit. It even surpassed the limits that the naked eye could perceive when a fifth realm martial artist was watching.</p>
<p>The audience below the stage only saw a blur before the tip of the spear pierced an inch in front of Shun Yuan&#x27;s brow. There&#x27;s no escaping it. This was the first thought in everyone&#x27;s mind. This shot locked onto the enemy&#x27;s vitals, sealing off all escape routes. Even Huan Nonging on the podium had her folding fan cracked from being squeezed.</p>
<p>This little girl is crazy. This is a desperate move. That kid is overconfident. On the arena, Shinuan did not dodge, or rather, he couldn&#x27;t escape it. The extremely sharp spear and tent hadn&#x27;t even touched his skin before it had already severed his protective dragon aura, and a drop of crimson blood seeped from between his brows.</p>
<p>The aura of death was incredibly strong. The S-rank undying dragon blood roared wildly in his veins, issuing a death warning. That&#x27;s the feeling. In that life or death moment, Shin Yuans mind remained surprisingly calm. Everything around us seemed to slow down.</p>
<p>He could see the spinning patterns on the spear tip, the resolute killing intent in Xiao Hongs eyes, and even the dust floating in the air. Technique, move, variation. In Shun Yuans mind, all the exquisite marksmanship techniques he had previously stolen were shattered at this moment. In the face of absolute power, all fancy tricks are superfluous. Dragons don&#x27;t need to learn how to use guns.</p>
<p>Dragons only need to use their claws to tear everything apart. Roar dash. A roar erupted from Shun Yuan&#x27;s throat. The roar of the primordial ancestral dragon. Boom.</p>
<p>His blood and she instantly reversed direction and his heart like a high-pressure pump delivered all the power to his right arm. The crimson gold flames of the SS rank undying flame soul were compressed and compressed again and again, merging into that right fist. The flesh-coled fist instantly turned into a translucent dark gold, as if magma capable of destroying the world was flowing inside. &quot;Break it for me!&quot; Shin Yuan simply threw a punch, meeting the deadly spear tip head-on with a fierce slam. Only power, a power that is pure to the extreme and doineering to the extreme.</p>
<p>One force can overcome 10 techniques. One force can overcome all laws. Boom! Fist and gun collided violently in midair. Time seemed to stand still at that moment. Immediately afterwards, a white shock wave spread wildly outwards in a ring from the point of impact between the two.</p>
<p>Click, click, click. The special alloy arena beneath their feet, which was said to be able to withstand the bombardment of a Sixth Realm expert, crumbled and collapsed like paper, turning into countless fragments that scattered in all directions. The protective shield groaned under the strain, cracked, and finally shattered completely with a bang. A violent shock wave swept across the entire arena, blowing the front row spectators to their sides, and even Su Xiao was thrown dozens of meters away by the gust of wind. What was that? A nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>My eyes, they&#x27;re so bright. Smoke and dust billowed, obscuring the sky and the sun. Everyone craned their necks and stared wideeyed at the center of the arena, eager to know the outcome. Who won? Is it the indestructible Crimson Lotus Spear? Is it still that doineering and unparalleled ancestral dragon fist? A few seconds later, a gust of wind blew by and the smoke and dust gradually dissipated. The arena had long since disappeared, leaving only a deep pit tens of meters in diameter.</p>
<p>Bottom of the pit. The two figures remained in the same positions they had been in when they collided. Xiao Hongi gripped the spear with both hands. The shaft bent into an astonishing arc, the tip pressed against Shaun Yuan&#x27;s fist. Her red armor was mostly torn apart, revealing her scarred skin underneath.</p>
<p>Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, and her face was as pale as paper. Shinuan, he maintained his punching stance. On that right fist, the flesh had already burst open, revealing the stark white bone, and blood dripped down the arm, but he didn&#x27;t back down an inch. Those golden vertical pupils burned with a chilling fervor. Click, click.</p>
<p>A faint crisp sound rang out sharply in the deathly silence of the pit. Xiao Hongi&#x27;s pupils suddenly contracted. In her hand lay a black and gold spear forged from meteorite iron which had accompanied her in battle for many years. A crack actually appeared starting from the tip of the spear. The cracks spread rapidly, crawling all over the gun like a spiderweb.</p>
<p>Impossible. Xiao Hongi was incredulous. This was her strongest attack. That bastard actually smashed it open with his fist. Nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan grinned, revealing a mouthful of bloodstained white teeth. Xiao Hongi, your gun is tough, but my fist is harder. Before he could finish speaking, Shin Yuan suddenly exerted force with his right arm again. Broken. Bang dash.</p>
<p>The black and gold spear finally succumbed to the terrifying force and shattered into countless black fragments. Xiao Hongi lost her support and flew backward, crashing into the pit wall. Puff! She opened her mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. We lost. We lost completely.</p>
<p>In his most prized field after unleashing his strongest attack, this man defeated him head-on with the simplest and most brutal punch. Who? Shin Yuan withdrew his fist, glanced at his hand, which was now a bloody mess with exposed bone and winced in pain. Damn, that really hurts. This woman&#x27;s got guts. He shook the blood off his hands and the regenerative power of the sgrade dragon blood began to take effect.</p>
<p>The granulation tissue writhed and the wound began to scab over at a visible speed. Shinyuan stumbled and walked to Xiao Hongi, looking down at this once invincible female warrior who is now in a sorry state. Xiao Hongi gritted her teeth, staring intently at him, her eyes filled with resentment, but even more so with an extremely complex emotion. It was awe of the strong and also the palpitation of a young girl whose heart had been shattered by violence. Kill me or torture me, it&#x27;s all up to you.</p>
<p>Xiao Hongi turned her head to the side, looking as if she would rather die than submit. Why would I kill you? I&#x27;m still waiting for you to warm my bed. Shin Yuan squatted down, stretched out his bloodstained hand, and forcefully pinched Xiao Hongs chin, forcing her to turn her head to look at him. How about that? A female warrior? Are you convinced now? Xiao Hani looked at that bloodstained yet devilishly charming face so close to hers and her heart skipped a beat. She opened her mouth wanting to curse as shameless.</p>
<p>But the words that were on the tip of my tongue turned into I&#x27;m convinced. The sound was very soft. You couldn&#x27;t hear it at all unless you listen carefully. But Shinuan heard it. He laughed loudly.</p>
<p>His laughter extremely arrogant and smug. He pulled Xiao Hani up from the ground and without waiting for her consent, hoisted her onto his shoulder like a savage from a primitive tribe, carrying the prey he just hunted. Su Xiao Yao, stop playing dead. Announce it now. Shin Yuan carried Xiao Hongi and strode out of the deep pit, shouting at the referee who was still in a days in the sky.</p>
<p>I won this round. Su Xiao suddenly realized what was happening and quickly picked up the microphone, her voice cracking with excitement. The semi-finals are over. Winner Shinuan from Dongghai. Wo! The entire venue erupted in cheers.</p>
<p>Countless people jumped up from their seats, waving their arms wildly. Shinuan! Shinuan! Shinuan! At this moment, no one called him a good for nothing anymore, nor did anyone call him a jigalo. &quot;He is the true king, a tyrant who subdued all the geniuses with his fists.&quot; On the player&#x27;s bench, Akasha blushed with excitement and clutched her heart in her hands. &quot;The Dragon Lord is so handsome. The way he carries the woman is simply breathtaking.</p>
<p>Longing shook her head helplessly, but a proud smile played on her lips. This bastard still loves to show off. Chinwell looked at Xiao Hongi, who was being carried on Shun Yuan&#x27;s shoulder and was struggling, but clearly not putting much effort into it. Her eyes dimmed, but she was also touched. Chapter 1, 192.</p>
<p>Victory Celebration Banquet. No, it&#x27;s a kidnapping. The cheers inside the dragon&#x27;s nest nearly blew the alloy dome off. Xiao Hongi looked like a rag doll with most of her red armor torn off, revealing her tight, enviable waist and abdomen skin underneath. She was still struggling, kicking her long legs wildly and muttering incoherently things like, &quot;Bastard, and let me go.</p>
<p>Snap. Behave yourself. If you move again, I&#x27;ll throw you down to feed the star beasts.&quot; Xiao Hongi stopped moving, but she really didn&#x27;t dare to move. This man is really daring to throw things. In midair, Su Xiao Yao repaired the broken microphone, cleared her throat, flapped her pink wings, and flew to the top of the stage.</p>
<p>Ahem, ladies and gentlemen, Su Xiaoa was furious just now. But at this moment, his face was flushed. After all, he hosted a match that will go down in history, so his record is solid. After final evaluation by the organizing committee and the mentor team of the seventh martial arts domain academy of the Galaxy Alliance, the list of five people who have qualified to go to the domain academy for further study in this battle of geniuses is now announced. The entire room fell silent.</p>
<p>Everyone perked up their ears. Go to the domain academy. That was an opportunity that countless martial artists would never dare to dream of. Once you get into that place, even if you&#x27;re just a gatekeeper, you can walk all over Earth when you come back. On the big screen, five golden names lit up one after another.</p>
<p>First place, Xiao Hongi from the north. Second place, Chinua from the capital. Third place, Dong Hai Longying. Fourth place, Western Frontier, Iron Mountain. Fifth place, Yigu Yun from the Southern Border.</p>
<p>The announcement of the list caused an uproar in the audience. Everyone looked at each other, their minds filled with questions. Something&#x27;s not right with this list. Xiao Hongi and Shin Shu deserve their selection as they are both top talents who made it to the final four. Taan and Yiguun lost, but their performances were still commendable, especially Yigiun&#x27;s swordsmanship, which is said to have already caught the eye of the combat and magic department&#x27;s instructor.</p>
<p>But where is the champion? Where is Shun Yuan? the one who crushed everyone, cleaved the fifth realm demon ape in two, and tore the ice phoenix dharma form apart with his bare hands. It&#x27;s a cover up. Absolutely a cover up. Why isn&#x27;t Shinuan included? He&#x27;s the champion. Exactly.</p>
<p>Even that monk who got knocked out can go. So why can&#x27;t Shin Yuan? Is it because he was too arrogant and offended the people above him? The audience was in a frenzy, and some even started throwing water bottles at the stage. Su Xiaoa was also stunned. She looked at the list several times to make sure that Shin Yuans name was not on it. She looked pleadingly at the silver warship in midair.</p>
<p>Quiet. A deep booming voice came from the warship, making everyone&#x27;s eardrums buzz. The burly instructor with a full beard jumped off the warship and landed on the arena with a thud. He looked around, his gaze lingering on Shin Yuan for two seconds, his expression complex. Shin Yuan is not included because because he&#x27;s my woman.</p>
<p>Does this kind of public list even deserve him? A voice, both alluring and doineering, interrupted the burly man. The void cracked open. Huaning walked out, swaying with a folding fan and wearing black high heels. Her purple Chong Sam fluttered in the wind, and the snow white slit was dazzling. She didn&#x27;t even look at anyone else and walked straight up to Shin Yuan, her peach blossom eyes filled with greed and eagerness.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan, you&#x27;re not on the list because I&#x27;ve already arranged for you to be specially recruited. Juan Nonging reached out her hand, even somewhat disregarding her image, and tried to grab Shin Yuans arm. Stop doawling. Come with the teacher now. Immediately, the spaceship engines are already warmed up.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s jump back to the domain academy. She was really anxious. Just now, Shin Yuan displayed an abnormal learning ability on the stage, as well as the method of perfectly integrating two opposing attributes. This made her feel extremely insecure. If this kind of monster stayed on Earth for even a second longer, it might attract the attention of other old monsters.</p>
<p>Must take it with you. However, Shin Yuan shifted his body to the side, dodging Huan Nongys hand. He tossed Xiao Hongi up on his shoulder and looked at the beautiful instructor with an expression as if she were crazy. I said, &quot;Miss Hua, why do you sound like you&#x27;re trying to kidnap me?&quot; Shin Yuan took a step back and glanced protectively at the silver figure waiting for him in the direction of the stage. Didn&#x27;t I just make myself very clear? I&#x27;m not leaving.</p>
<p>At least for today, even if the king of heaven himself came, I wouldn&#x27;t leave. Juan Nomings smile froze and the veins on her forehead throbbed. Shinuan. She lowered her voice and a terrifying pressure began to erupt, distorting the surrounding air. Do you even know what you&#x27;re saying? That&#x27;s a special admission that leads directly to the core of the domain academy.</p>
<p>Do you know how many people would sell their own fathers for that spot? Are you willing to give up this smooth and successful path for the sake of such sentimental feelings? Give up? Shinuan was amused. He put Xiao Hongi down from his shoulder, not caring whether the female war goddess could stand steadily and pushed her directly into Huan Nongs arms. Who said, &quot;I gave up. Teacher Hua, how about this?&quot; Shinuan pointed to Xiao Hongi, who looked completely bewildered and had been caught by Huan Nong Ying. This girl is something else.</p>
<p>She has a terrible temper, but her fiery and spicy personality matches your primal evolution quite well. Are you going to take her away first as a deposit or perhaps a meeting gift? Xiao Hongi. Huan Ying. Shinuan, what do you take me for? Merchandise? Xiao Hongi was so angry that she almost bit Huan Nonging high breasts. Just as she was about to struggle, Huanong Ying held her down with one hand.</p>
<p>Huan Nong Ying looked down at Xiao Hongi in her arms and then expertly pinched her bones twice with her fingers. Huh? Huan Nongyings eyes lit up with his gun intent contained and his body having undergone multiple extreme tearing and reconstructions. He is indeed a promising talent. She raised her head and looked at Shin Yuan with a half smile. Are you using your wife to pay off your debts? What do you mean by paying off debts? That sounds so awful.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan waved his hand, his face full of righteous indignation. I&#x27;m training talent for humanity. This girl is just a gun enthusiast on Earth, but in your hands, she&#x27;ll be unstoppable. You can take her back and train her first after I get married on Blue Star and take care of everything. I&#x27;ll go to the Domain Academy to inspect the results.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this the best of both worlds? Huan Ying was so angry, she laughed. She&#x27;d seen arrogant people in her life, but never anyone this shameless. but this proposal. She glanced at Xiao Hongi who was stubbornly defiant in her arms and then at Shun Yuans shameless expression as if to say, &quot;If you don&#x27;t agree, I&#x27;ll just lie down.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; Huaning took a deep breath and forcibly suppressed the urge to tie Shin Yuan up and take him back. The most taboo thing in the lineage of primitive evolution is going against one&#x27;s true nature.</p>
<p>This kid&#x27;s head is full of thoughts about getting married right now. If we forcibly take him away, his mind won&#x27;t be at peace, and he might just waste all his talent. I&#x27;ll give you time. Huan Nomian picked Xiao Hongi up like a chick. And with her other hand, she unfolded a folding fan and tapped Shinuan on the forehead.</p>
<p>But listen to me carefully. At most 1 month, if you don&#x27;t show up at the gate of the domain academy a month later, Huan Nong licked her red lips, a dangerous glint flashing in her peach blossom eyes. I&#x27;ll personally lead my men back to kill them all and capture your so-called queen wife along with all your confidants and bring them to the domain academy for an open assembly. Don&#x27;t blame the teacher for lacking professional ethics when the time comes. Without waiting for Shaun Yuans reply, she grabbed Xiao Hongi, who was still struggling and cursing, and with a flash, she transformed into a streak of light and rushed back to the warship.</p>
<p>Shinuan, you bastard. I&#x27;ll haunt you even as a ghost. Xiao Hongis shrill curses echoed in the air, sending chills down everyone&#x27;s spines. Shinuan picked at his ear, looking completely indifferent. Sha, what&#x27;s the point of being a ghost? Being a wife is much better.</p>
<p>Having gotten rid of this biggest troublemaker, Shin Yuan finally breathed a sigh of relief. He turned around. I straightened out that tattered trench coat that revealed large patches of muscle. Then he put on that signature smile, a smile that was both roguish and bursting with confidence. He lifted his foot and walked towards the woman who had been waiting for him for a long time in the center of the stage.</p>
<p>The important business is done. Now it&#x27;s time to get down to business. Chapter 193. A proposal of the century. The correct use of S-rank bloodline.</p>
<p>The spotlight on the stage is shining on only one person at this moment. Muching. She stood there like a snow lotus standing alone in the world. All around were deafening screams. Countless fans waving glow sticks wildly and billions of eyes across the empire watching through the screen.</p>
<p>But in her world at this moment, there was only the man who was walking towards her step by step, stepping over the rubble and ruins. He hadn&#x27;t had time to change into the elegant and proper suit he had last time. His body was still covered in blood and dust. The black trench coat had several holes, revealing a strong, sweat beaded chest underneath, and the scent of hormones wafted out as he walked. This image is completely different from the wealthy young men who used to fawn over her.</p>
<p>Rude, barbaric, and unckempt. But in Muing Shuas eyes, it was the most handsome battle robe in the world because that blood was shed for her. The championship trophy he trampled under his feet was one for her. Shinuan walked to the edge of the stage. With one hand supporting him, he deafly flipped himself onto the stage.</p>
<p>He stood casually in front of Mu Ching Shiua less than half a meter away. I could smell her cool, delicate fragrance from her. You can also see her pupils trembling slightly with nervousness beneath her long eyelashes. Young married woman. Shinyuan spoke.</p>
<p>That deep booming voice could be clearly heard on the eerily quiet stage. That wife was called out with such confidence and ease. Muching&#x27;s face flushed bright red instantly all the way down to her ears. She&#x27;s a superstar, someone who&#x27;s seen it all. But at this moment, she felt like a shy young girl who had just fallen in love, unsure of what to do with her hands and feet.</p>
<p>You won, Mu Ching Shua bit her lower lip, her voice as soft as a mosquito&#x27;s hum, yet it carried a resolute air. Yes, we won. Shinuan grinned, revealing a set of bright white teeth. He reached out and gently tidied a stray strand of hair behind Muing Shus ear. His movements so tender that they were unlike the mad man who had just brutally beaten up various prodigies on the arena.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this while we were fighting. If you lose, who will listen to your singing? Who will warm your bed? Who will keep your crazy fans out? Thinking about all this makes me feel. Shin Yuan leaned forward, his dark eyes fixed intently on Mu Chingshi, the heat within them almost melting her. I cannot lose. Even if it means tearing a hole in the sky, I will bring this championship back because this is your betroal gift.</p>
<p>Boom. Dash. Upon hearing this, the audience who had been indignant about the behind-the-scenes manipulation instantly erupted in anger. Wow, that&#x27;s amazing. I want a dowy like that, too.</p>
<p>Using a national championship as a dowy. What kind of unbelievable plot is this? I&#x27;m so jealous. I&#x27;m absolutely jealous. Shinuan may be a jerk, but he&#x27;s so incredibly doting on me. Give me a kiss.</p>
<p>Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. No one knows who started it, but the entire audience of 100,000 people began to cheer in unison. The roar was so loud that the stage trembled slightly. Muching looked at the man in front of her, her eyes reening.</p>
<p>She grew up in the spotlight, receiving countless praises and expensive gifts. But never before had she felt so breathless with excitement as she did now. This man truly kept his promise. He gave her the most exquisite romance in front of the whole world. Shinuan Mu Ching Shiwa raised her head, her clear, cold eyes shimmering with tears.</p>
<p>She no longer held back, no longer cared about her image as a diva. She reached out and wrapped her arms around Shin Yuans neck. Stand on tiptoe under the watchful eyes of billions of people. She pressed her red lips, which had never been touched by anyone before, onto Shaun Yuans lips. Shinyuan felt as if a string in his mind had snapped.</p>
<p>He originally just wanted to show off and flirt with the diva. But this sudden initiative directly ignited the dragon blood within him that had not yet fully subsided. H Shin Yuan grabbed Mu Ching Shu&#x27;s slender waist with his other hand and pulled her into his arms. Passive? That&#x27;s not his style. This was a kiss that was so long it took my breath away.</p>
<p>The flashbulbs of cameras went off wildly in the audience and the sound of camera shutters filled the air. This photograph is destined to become the headline of all media outlets in the entire empire tomorrow and will be recorded in the history of entertainment and martial arts until Muing Shua was almost out of breath. He looked at the woman in his arms, her eyes glazed over, her face flushed like a peach blossom, and a wicked smile crept onto his lips. Good. However, this is only interest.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll calculate the actual principle when we get back to the room. Mu Ching Shua trembled and buried her head in his chest, not daring to look at the person who came from behind. But he glanced at the huge crowd around him and the drones still broadcasting live in the sky. Everyone, Shin Yuan suddenly scooped Mu Ching Shiwa up in his arms and carried her in a perfect princess carry. He waved arrogantly at the cameras below the stage.</p>
<p>That concludes today&#x27;s match. The championship is mine and so is the man. As for that award ceremony, Shinuan glanced at the empty trophy. Stand not far away and shrugged indifferently. Give those empty superficial things to whomever you want.</p>
<p>Lasu now. He lowered his head and looked at Mu Ching Shua who was covering her face in embarrassment in his arms. His smile became extremely radiant. I&#x27;m going back to get married. After saying that, Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t give anyone a chance to react.</p>
<p>He suddenly exerted force with his feet. Boom. A large crater was blown open in the ground. He carried Mu Ching Shiu and leaped directly through the hole in the dome of the Dragon Nest Arena, transforming into a golden streak of light as he flew towards Ling Yun Pavilion, the most luxurious manor in the capital. All that remained were the 100,000 audience members in the venue and hundreds of billions of bewildered onlookers in front of their screens.</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s Su Xiao Yao standing in the wind, microphone in hand, looking disheveled. They&#x27;re gone already. Su Xia Yao watched the departing streak of light, her lips twitching wildly. They don&#x27;t even want the trophy anymore. That&#x27;s way too eager.</p>
<p>Chapter 194. A test of true feelings in a villa. A big stars choice. Ling Yun Pavilion is located halfway up a mountain in the capital city where land is extremely valuable. On ordinary days, apart from the sound of the wind, it is so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>Call. A golden streak of light pierced the night, carrying with it the lingering heat and crashed directly onto the huge open air balcony on the third floor of the villa. Shen Yuan landed very steadily without even breaking a single tile beneath his feet. The woman in his arms was as light as a feather. Her silver white performance costume was a little cool and clung to his sweaty chest, arousing a strange sensation.</p>
<p>Arrive. Shinuan put the person in his arms down, casually tugged at the collar, and realized that the tattered trench coat was nowhere to be found. Muching&#x27;s toes barely touched the ground, her body still a little weak. That high altitude flight was a first for her. She leaned against the railing, panting heavily.</p>
<p>Her exquisite face was still flushed, and her beautiful eyes were watery, showing both nervousness and a hint of helplessness. This is not the bustling dragon&#x27;s nest. There are no billions of eyes watching. No cheers and no lights. It was just him and her.</p>
<p>This private quiet, ironically, amplified the ambiguous atmosphere in the air. What? Still not quite there? The fire in Shun Yuan&#x27;s heart subsided somewhat. He walked to the wine cabinet next to him, and without taking a glass, he picked up a bottle of red wine that looked extremely expensive, bit off the cork, and took a big gulp. The dark red liquid flowed down the corner of his mouth, slid over his Adam&#x27;s apple, and finally disappeared into the muscle texture of his chest. &quot;This scene is incredibly wild.&quot; Muching was somewhat stunned.</p>
<p>&quot;Want a drink?&quot; Shinuan handed over the bottle. Mu Ching Shua hesitated for a second, but still reached out and took it, imitating him, and tilted her head back to drink a sip. Perhaps she drank too quickly, or the liquor was too strong, because she choked and coughed violently. A few drops of liquor splashed onto her silver white battle dress like red plum blossoms blooming in the snow. Cough, cough.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so spicy. She stuck out her tongue and coughed up tears. Shin Yuan chuckled, reaching out to gently pat her back, the warmth of his palms seeping through the thin fabric. You&#x27;ve managed to drink a bottle of liquor worth tens of thousands of yuan like it&#x27;s erot a type of Chinese liquor. That&#x27;s something else.</p>
<p>The atmosphere relaxed a little. Shin Yuan leaned against the railing, took out a cigarette from his pocket, and lit it. The flickering light reflected in his deep eyes. He didn&#x27;t rush to do anything inappropriate for children. Although his body wanted to, his mind was still clear.</p>
<p>Young married woman Shun Yuan exhaled a smoke ring, looked at her through the swirling smoke, and his tone suddenly became somewhat serious, even carrying a hint of cynical probing. Just now on stage, I got carried away and ran off with you. Now that the cold wind is blowing, do you regret it? Mu Ching Shua was stunned for a moment, still clutching the wine bottle tightly in her hand, her knuckles turning white. What is there to regret? I regret getting on this pirate ship, Shin Yuan flicked his cigarette ash, pointed to himself, and then to the enormous villa. Look closely.</p>
<p>I, Shin Yuan, am just an ordinary person. I don&#x27;t like to reason when I fight, and I act entirely on my mood. Most importantly, he took a step forward, and the oppressive aura emanating from him suddenly intensified. His eyes were fixed on Mu Chingshi, not allowing her to look away in the slightest. I&#x27;m greedy, fickle, and have no conscience.</p>
<p>You saw the match just now. Longing is pregnant with my child, that Vixen Akasha is sleeping in the same bed with me, and even Xiao Hongi, who wanted to kill me. I&#x27;ve already reserved her as merchandise. Shin Yuan mocked himself, saying this was his final honesty as a scumbag. I&#x27;m just a lousy person.</p>
<p>Aside from being good at networking, handsome, well-endowed, and physically fit, the rest of him is full of flaws. You are a high-ranking superstar, the daughter of the Moo family, and the men who pursue you could stretch from the capital to the East China Sea. Some are gentle, some are devoted, and some treat you like a princess. As for me, I&#x27;ll most likely only be one of you. Shin Yuan stubbed out his cigarette on the railing, his voice lowering.</p>
<p>Even so, would you still be willing to marry him? The door isn&#x27;t locked yet. If you want to leave, I Shinyuan won&#x27;t stop you. Consider that kiss just now a bonus for winning the competition. We&#x27;re even now. After saying that, Shinuan took a step back, put his hands in his pockets, and looked carefree as if he didn&#x27;t care whether he stayed or left.</p>
<p>But his slightly narrowed eyes never left Muing Shuas face. He&#x27;s gambling. I&#x27;m betting on the hidden strength within this seemingly delicate diva. It&#x27;s also about finding a reason to completely indulge oneself. If she agrees, he will crush and devour this most beautiful flower in the empire tonight.</p>
<p>A cool night breeze rustled Mu Ching Shua&#x27;s silver skirt, making a soft whisper. She stood there showing no surprise or grievance at Shun Yuans blunt and almost hurtful words. On the contrary, her cool eyes, which naturally carried a sense of detachment, now held a touch more rationality. She put down the wine bottle in her hand. The glass bottle made a crisp clanging sound as it touched the marble tabletop.</p>
<p>She started to take action. It wasn&#x27;t about hitting someone, nor was it about turning away. Instead, he raised his hand and reached behind his head. Click. A soft sound.</p>
<p>The exquisite silver crown that bound her long hair was untied and casually tossed to the ground. Her long flowing black hair cascaded down in an instant, dancing in the wind, losing its usual stage elegance and gaining a touch of wild untamed beauty. Next were earrings and necklaces, she removed and discarded those expensive ornaments that symbolized her diva status one by one. Shinuan, she finally spoke, her voice no longer ethereal as when she sang, but a clear youthful tone. She walked step by step toward Shinuan.</p>
<p>Her high heels clicked firmly on the ground, each step steady and resolute. Do you think I, Muing Shua, am an idiot? She walked up to Shin Yuan, so close that she could smell his unique scent, a mixture of tobacco, sweat, and red wine. I know about Lyings situation. I know about Akasha&#x27;s situation, too. I even noticed that Chinu&#x27;s gaze towards you was off.</p>
<p>Mu Ching Shuer raised her head, her eyes showing no trace of jealousy, only an almost obsessive fervor. But so what? I grew up in a wealthy family and have seen many hypocrites who appear devoted to one man but secretly keep a string of lovers. Although they may only marry one woman, their hearts are scattered and corrupt. She stretched out her slender fingers and gently poked Shinuans heart. You are different.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re openly bad and utterly despicable. And a beautiful blush rose on Muing Shiuas cheeks, but her eyes became bolder, even carrying a hint of provocation. Do you think I really care how many women you have? What I care about is whether you can move me. From childhood to adulthood, there have been too many men who fawn over me. They are all subservient to me and they would tremble with fear if I even frowned.</p>
<p>Muching seemed to be using up all the courage she had in her life. What I want is a hero that I can look up to, that I can admire, that can pierce the sky when I am most helpless. Even if the hero is a jerk and a womanizer, as long as he&#x27;s strong enough, as long as he can make my heart flutter, I&#x27;ll accept it. Shinyuan looked at the diva in front of him, who seemed to have completely changed, and his Adam&#x27;s apple bobbed violently. He never expected that this seemingly aloof goddess would have such a passionate and crazy heart hidden beneath her outer shell.</p>
<p>This is hardly a little white rabbit. This is clearly a wild cat that hasn&#x27;t grown its fangs yet. Chapter 195. Shedding the halo to be a woman. The temptation of S-class bloodline.</p>
<p>You admit it. Shinuans voice was a little horsearse, and the blood in his body began to boil. Yes, I admit it. Mu Ching Shua bit her lower lip, then suddenly stood on tiptoe, wrapped her arms around Shun Yuans neck, and pressed her whole body against him. The silver white performance costume was a bit stiff, digging into their skin, but it acted more like a catalyst.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan, I don&#x27;t care how much of you I am. I only care about. She leaned close to Shun Yuans ear, her breath sweet and fragrant, her voice trembling yet inviting. Tonight, are you mine alone? Shinuans head was about to explode. If he could still tolerate this, he could use his S-rank dragon blood to water flowers.</p>
<p>Shiny Yuan let out a low roar and then said, &quot;No more nonsense.&quot; He grabbed Mu Ching Shuas head with his large hand, lowered his head, and kissed her fiercely. H Muing Shua let out a sob. Shinuan had one arm around her waist and the other hand around the cumbersome performance costume. These tattered clothes are so hard to take off. He muttered something.</p>
<p>Tear. A sharp tearing sound. He ripped a large hole in the side of that priceless battle dress which was handsewn by a top designer. Her snow white skin exposed to the air gleamed with an ivory-like sheen under the moonlight. Shin Yuan bent down, picked Mu Chingshi up in his arms, and kicked open the bedroom door with great strides.</p>
<p>Tonight, no one will take you away from me. Even the king of heaven can&#x27;t do it. The bedroom door was slammed shut, cutting off the outside wind, and the entire world. The room was dark with only moonlight streaming in from the window, illuminating the excessively large black bed. Shinuan threw Muing Shua onto the bed.</p>
<p>The mattress was extremely soft, and she sank into it completely. Her long black hair spread out like black seaweed, making her face appear even whiter and more beautiful. The torn silver stage costume clung to her body, a delicate and alluring sight. Its broken beauty even more captivating than complete nudity. Shinuan stood by the bed, looking down at her.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t rush to pounce. He was admiring it. Admire this most perfect trophy that belongs to him. Mu Ching Shua lay there, her heart pounding as if it would explode. She could feel Shy Yuans gaze, so tangible, moving over her like fire, making every inch of her skin burn and tremble.</p>
<p>This is the man she chose. Shinyuan, she couldn&#x27;t help but shout, her voice so enchanting that it startled even herself. Shinuan smiled. What&#x27;s the rush? Weren&#x27;t you being quite brave on the terrace just now? Why are you trembling now? I didn&#x27;t. Muching was stubborn, but her body betrayed her by shrinking back slightly.</p>
<p>even though she was mentally prepared. This was truly her first time experiencing it in real life. No. Shin Yuan chuckled softly, hooking his finger around the edge of the tattered performance costume and gently lifting it. The entire garment slipped off.</p>
<p>A perfectly beautiful body that can be described as a work of art. Not an ounce of excess fat. Every curve is just right, especially her legs, which were straight, long, firm, and well proportioned. Truly a gift from the creator. Wow.</p>
<p>No wonder she&#x27;s the nation&#x27;s goddess. That figure shinuan lowered his head and gently bit her fair neck. It&#x27;s even better than it looks on TV. Two hours later, Shinuan, what are you laughing at? Mu Ching Shiua nestled in Shun Yuans arms, felt the vibrations in his chest. She raised her head and nuzzled his chin like a lazy kitten.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s nothing, I just feel. Shin Yuan lowered his head and kissed her forehead. His eyes filled with an almost unbelievable tenderness. The evolution of this S-class bloodline is indeed very tempting, but compared to you, he tightened his arms, feeling the soft warmth in his embrace. Sleeping with my wife in my arms is still the most comfortable.</p>
<p>Mu Ching Shua felt a surge of sweetness in her heart, and her previous physical discomfort vanished instantly. She stretched out her finger and drew circles on Shaun Yuans pectoral muscles, then suddenly seemed to remember something and asked with some concern. Shin Yuans mentor mentioned a one-mon period. Are you really going to that domain academy? Although they&#x27;ve only just started dating, she&#x27;s already feeling insecure and anxious. The universe is so vast and so far away.</p>
<p>What if he goes and doesn&#x27;t come back? What if he meets a better woman over there? Shinyuan grabbed her mischievous little hand and kissed it. I definitely have to go. His gaze deepened as he looked out the window at the vast starry sky. This world is too small to contain my ambition, nor can it protect you. The long family and that old man who ran away today are just appetizers.</p>
<p>There will be even stronger enemies to come. Only when I become strong enough, strong enough to make the entire universe tremble. Can I truly do whatever I want. Shinyuan turned his head, looked at Mu Shing Shu&#x27;s somewhat dim eyes, and smiled. But don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m a homebody.</p>
<p>Moreover, that Aunt Hua gave me a location stone, so I can come back anytime. Besides, Shin Yuan leaned close to her ear, his voice becoming extremely indecent. I haven&#x27;t paid my share of the grain tax yet. How can I bear to leave? Mu Ching Shua blushed and playfully punched him. You scoundrel.</p>
<p>Who wants your public grain? Don&#x27;t want. Shinuan raised an eyebrow. That&#x27;s not what that person just shouted. Hey, don&#x27;t mess around. It&#x27;s okay.</p>
<p>I have my own unique massage techniques. Liar. The moonlight was like water. The next morning, as the first rays of sunlight streamed into the room, Shin Yuan was already standing refreshed on the terrace. On the bed behind her, Muing Shiu was still fast asleep, her exposed shoulders bearing many ambiguous red marks.</p>
<p>Shinuan took out the Stargate positioning stone given to him by Huan Nongying, and tossed it in his hand. A month, Shinuan stared at the crystal clearar stone, pondering for a long time. Before that, we still need to take care of the remaining things on this blue planet. For example, the icy CEO of Ton Shin Industrial. And then there&#x27;s Xiao Hongi&#x27;s training plan, as well as Shin Yuan&#x27;s gaze turned to the distant west.</p>
<p>A cold killing intent flashing in his eyes. It&#x27;s time for that Rothschild family to start collecting some interest. Chapter 196. Call me husband. Lung Yu gets jealous.</p>
<p>A battleground at 10,000 m above the ground. 10,000 m above the clouds. The jet black Shadow Dragon fighter jet tore through the air currents, moving as smoothly as a mobile aerial palace. Inside the cabin, the luxurious leather sofas are large enough to accommodate four or five people lying down. Shinyuan was indeed lying down at the moment, and he was lying there very comfortably.</p>
<p>His head rested on Akasha&#x27;s plump thighs while his legs were unceremoniously draped over the hem of Mu Chingshi&#x27;s silver white dress. And he was playing with a strand of fragrant black hair in his hand. Honey, you sang that breaking the enemy&#x27;s formation sung really well just now. You had a spirit that showed that women are just as capable as men. Shin Yuan twirled a strand of hair around his fingertip.</p>
<p>His gaze, however, darting inappropriately towards Mu Ching Shuas torn dress, making clicking noises under his breath. However, I still think the few su hummed in my ear last night were more charming. Muing Shua almost spat out the water she had just taken a sip of. Her cool and aloof face flushed bright red instantly like a ripe tomato. She immediately covered her collar, glaring at Shin Yuan with embarrassment and anger.</p>
<p>Shut up. There are other people here. What&#x27;s there to be afraid of? They&#x27;re all our own sisters. Shin Yuan chuckled, then reached out and pinched Mu Ching Shus smooth jade-like cheek with even more force. Come on, while no one&#x27;s bothering you, give us a nice shout.</p>
<p>Mu Ching Shu stiffened, her eyes darting nervously towards Long In sitting opposite her and Lung Yu in the cockpit. What are you yelling for? Call me husband or aa darling? Shin Yuan raised an eyebrow, his golden vertical pupils full of mockery. Weren&#x27;t you calling me that so readily last night? Why are you denying it now that you&#x27;re dressed? I didn&#x27;t. Mu Ching Shua felt like she was about to burst into flames. What a shameless, despicable man.</p>
<p>Hurry up. I&#x27;ll count to three. Shinuan made a move to get up. If you don&#x27;t call out, I&#x27;ll just help you recall the details of last night in front of everyone. Old husband.</p>
<p>Startled, Muing Shua quickly spoke up. Her voice as soft and sweet as freshly baked cotton candy. That day, the queen&#x27;s voice was truly kissed by God. Even such simple words, when spoken by her, carried a delicate and charming quality. Shinyuan felt his bones melt.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so good,&quot; Shin Yuan exclaimed, his face filled with delight as his large hand casually slid around Muing Shuas waist. With that voice, it would be a waste if I didn&#x27;t sing to lull her to sleep. &quot;Shinuan, haven&#x27;t you had enough?&quot; Finally, someone on the other side couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. Longing was dressed in a crisp black combat uniform, her arms crossed over her chest, her long legs crossed, and her black military boots gleaming coldly under the lights. Her spirited face was filled with disdain, and the veins on her forehead throbbed.</p>
<p>This is a fighter jet area, not your herm bed. Can&#x27;t you be a little more mindful of the impact? Longing could no longer tolerate it. That bastard. It&#x27;s one thing to flirt with another woman right in front of her, but he did it so blatantly. Oh, is instructor Long jealous? Shiny Yuan sat up from Akashas lap and grinned as he moved closer to Ling.</p>
<p>Get lost. Who&#x27;s jealous of you? Longing snorted coldly, raised her long leg clad in military boots, and kicked Shin Yuan&#x27;s shin without any hesitation. This kick wasn&#x27;t meant to kill, but it was definitely powerful. Shin Yuan didn&#x27;t even try to dodge. Smack.</p>
<p>His large hand gripped Long Yings ankle precisely. He held the military boot in his hand like a toy. Shin Yuan&#x27;s fingers slid inside the boot shaft and gently pinched the firm calf. Hiss. Longing gasped, feeling as if she had been electrocuted, the tingling sensation shooting from her calves to the top of her head.</p>
<p>Let go. Longing blushed. Instructor Long, you&#x27;re pregnant, but your temper is still so explosive. Shinuan not only didn&#x27;t let go, but instead pulled her legs closer to his chest, leaning in and forcing Long ing into a corner of the sofa. their noses almost touched.</p>
<p>Since you think I&#x27;m being biased, I&#x27;ll give you a chance. Shiny Yuan stared intently at Long Ying. Come on, call me husband, too. If you do it well, I&#x27;ll give you a lesson when we get home tonight. You&#x27;re dreaming.</p>
<p>Longing gritted her teeth and turned her head away. Shameless. You won&#x27;t call. Then I&#x27;ll have to charge interest. Shin Yuan chuckled mischievously and lowered his head to bite her bright red earlobe.</p>
<p>Beep beep. At this critical moment, a rapid warning sound suddenly came from the cockpit. Lung Yu, who had been silent and had her back to everyone, spoke in a cold, hard voice. Mr. Shan, we are about to enter the airspace over the East China Sea.</p>
<p>I would also like to remind you that our current altitude is 13,000 m, and the air flow is turbulent. Please be seated and fasten your seat belt. The voice was as cold as an ice cube just pulled from a freezer, full of resentment. Shinyuan paused, then released Long Yings leg. He turned his head and looked at the straight back of the person in the cockpit.</p>
<p>Lung Yu was wearing a black business suit. To make driving easier, she took off her coat and wore only a white fitted shirt. She gripped the control lever tightly with both hands. And through the rear view mirror, Shinuan could see that her icy blue eyes were full of resentment and grievance. How could I not feel wronged? She was the third person after Longing to want to follow Shin Yuan.</p>
<p>From being a personal instructor during the initial interviews to becoming a personal secretary later on. For Shun Yuan&#x27;s sake, she even accepted the Venus transformation project, transforming herself into the most perfect S-class figure. And what was the result? Lyn Sharon, that naive and innocent girl, let&#x27;s leave that aside. She was my first love. Natasha, that foreign girl, has caught up and is now pregnant.</p>
<p>Su Ching Zhu, that research fanatic, used the guise of experimentation to sleep with people. Ling, that violent woman, is also pregnant. Now, even Akasha, the countest from an enemy country, and Muing Shiwa, the big star, are ahead of her in the rankings. So, Lu was just a spectator. Is he a driver who specializes in flying planes and driving cars? Shinyuan looked at that figure from behind, and his heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Oh no, I was so busy coaxing the new girl that I forgot about this old knife. This secretary long is a real doer. She&#x27;s usually quiet and unassuming. If this accumulates too much resentment, and someone later takes some kind of medication or goes on strike, that would be a real problem. Shinuan stood up from the sofa, straightened his collar, gave Akasha and Muing Shua a reassuring look, and then stroed into the cockpit.</p>
<p>The cockpit wasn&#x27;t very big. Lung Yu sat in the driver&#x27;s seat with the passenger next to her. Shin Yuan did not sit in the passenger seat. He stood directly behind Lung Yu, placed his hands on the back of the chair, and pulled Lung Yu into his arms. What&#x27;s wrong, Secretary L? Shin Yuan lowered his head, his lips brushing against her earlobe, his warm breath spraying onto her sensitive neck.</p>
<p>The plane was flying perfectly fine. So why does it smell sour? Lung Yus body trembled suddenly, her hand gripping the control stick shook, and the plane immediately took a slight dive. No, not at all. Lung Yu forced herself to remain calm, staring intently at the dashboard. I was just doing my job and reminding you to be careful.</p>
<p>Safety? Shin Yuan chuckled, and one of his hands, rather unruly, slid down the side of the chair back and landed on her thigh, which was tightly wrapped in a black bodycon dress. Lung Yu, how long have you been following me? Lung Yu bit her lower lip, her voice slightly. 1 month and 7 days. I remember it so clearly. Yes, it&#x27;s been a month.</p>
<p>Shin Yuans fingers tapped lightly on her leg in a rhythmic pattern. Seeing your friends graduate one by one, and even those who came later surpass you must be hard to bear, right? Lyu didn&#x27;t speak, but her breathing became rapid and her chest heaved considerably. I know what you&#x27;re thinking. Don&#x27;t rush. He leaned close to L Yus ear and in a voice only the two of them could hear made an extremely dangerous promise.</p>
<p>When I get back this time, I&#x27;ll deal with those blind fools. I will set aside an entire day for it. I&#x27;ll only be with you. At that time, Shin Yuan glanced at her long legs, which looked exceptionally alluring under the black stockings, and as Adam&#x27;s apple bobbed. I&#x27;m going to make sure your legs never leave my sight, and you can&#x27;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Lung Yu turned her head, and the resentment in her icy blue eyes was instantly replaced by a fervent joy. Really? When have I, Shin Yuan, ever lied to my own people? Shin Yuan reached out and tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, his eyes filled with tenderness. You are my sword and also my personal secretary. This family can&#x27;t function without you. Lung Yus eyes reened.</p>
<p>She nodded emphatically, and a joyful smile finally bloomed on her face, which was usually as cold as ice. I&#x27;m waiting for you. Chapter 197. The Rothschild Fleet is approaching. The exquisite war goddess intervenes.</p>
<p>Donghai City, coastal defense line. This is the front line in the fight against the beast tide. Suddenly, a blinding red light appeared on the radar screens of the entire East China Sea Theater. Warning, warning. Large-scale energy reaction detected.</p>
<p>Direction due east. Distance 50 nautical miles. My god, that&#x27;s at least an entire aircraft carrier strike group. Inside the command center of the Umbrella Corporation headquarters, Leon looked at the densely packed dots of light on the large screen. All units, level one combat readiness.</p>
<p>This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. Activate the coastal defense cannons. All Titan class city defense cannons are now unlocked. Notify Shinuan.</p>
<p>Tell him not to land yet. tell him to take his men and evacuate inland first. Rumble. On the sea surface, the calm seaater suddenly began to boil. One after another, colossal warships, entirely black and with futuristic designs, cleaved through the waves, appearing in everyone&#x27;s sight like steel behemoths.</p>
<p>These warships did not fly the flags of any country, but on the prow of every warship was painted a huge golden coat of arms. A griffin clutching five arrows, the Rothschilds. Lean&#x27;s pupils contracted sharply, and the water glass in her hand fell to the ground with a crash and shattered into pieces. That is one of the oldest and most mysterious families in the Free Federation and a top tier conglomerate that controls half of the Federation&#x27;s economic lifeline, the Rothschild family. Their private armed forces are more terrifying than the regular armies of some small and medium-sized countries.</p>
<p>What are they trying to do? Are they crazy? Leun gritted her teeth, openly invading Lshias territorial waters. Is this an attempt to provoke a full-scale war? Roar dash. Just then, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted from the flagship of that fleet. A golden beam of light shot straight into the sky, shattering the clouds. Eight realms.</p>
<p>That was the genuine pressure of an eighth realm expert. Listen up, you ants of the East China Sea. An aged yet majestic voice carried by vital energy resounded like rolling thunder throughout the entire Dong Hai city. We have no intention of starting a war hand over the people we want. Otherwise, we would have flattened the East China Sea today.</p>
<p>The voice was doineering and extremely arrogant. Inside the umbrella base command center, everyone&#x27;s hearts sank to the bottom. Eighth realm expert. This is something that ordinary martial artists like them simply cannot contend with. Is the East China Sea, which has just survived the beast tide, about to face another catastrophe? Just as despair began to spread, buzz.</p>
<p>The sky above Donghai City suddenly distorted violently. A crimson figure appeared out of thin air directly in front of the massive fleet. She wore a long flowing crimson robe with flowing clouds, her feet treading on the air, her clothes billowing in the wind. Facing the overwhelming torrent of steel and the terrifying pressure of an eighth realm expert, she simply stood there quietly. It&#x27;s like an insurmountable chasm.</p>
<p>Rothschilds. Yu Ling Longs even more doineering voice overwhelmed the rolling thunder and entered everyone&#x27;s ears. She slightly raised her eyelids and two balls of crimson gold flames ignited in her indifferent Phoenix eyes. Who gave you the audacity to bark so arrogantly at the doorstep of my lung sha? Boom. Dash.</p>
<p>As soon as she finished speaking, a void flame phoenix power that was even purer and more doineering than her opponents erupted from her body. The azure sky was died crimson. A gigantic phoenix phantom appeared behind her. Its wings spread wide, blotting out the sky. The supreme pressure emanating from her divine bloodline actually suppressed the momentum of the fleet.</p>
<p>Jade exquisite. On the flagship, the voice of the eighth realm expert carried a hint of apprehension, but even more so, a sense of exasperation. Are you really going to make an enemy of the Rothschild family for the sake of a tiny East China Sea? We only want that kid named Shinuan and that traitorous Akasha. Hand them over and well retreat immediately. Otherwise, even if you are a war god, you cannot protect this city.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t be saved. Yu Ling Langs lips curled into a cold, extremely contemptuous smile. She raised her right hand, and in her palm, a crimson gold fire lotus was slowly rotating, radiating an aura of destruction. You can give it a try. Take one step forward, and you&#x27;ll die.</p>
<p>Five words: simple, direct, and exuding doineering aura. This is the exquisite war goddess. The two forces clashed violently on the sea, and the air itself seemed to explode under the strain. A great war is about to break out. At this critical moment, when tensions were running high, boom, dash, high in the sky, the black shadow dragon fighter jet finally broke through the clouds, appearing above the battlefield with a piercing sonic boom.</p>
<p>Wow, it&#x27;s so lively here. The fighter jets hatch opened. Shin Yuan jumped from a height of 1,000 m before the plane even came to a complete stop. He was wearing a somewhat tattered trench coat, his hands in his pockets, and he landed beside Yu Ling long like a meteorite. Thump.</p>
<p>He stepped on the sea and created a huge crater, stirring up waves hundreds of meters high. Shin Yuan stood steadily on the crest of the wave, looking at the massive fleet opposite him and picked his ear, who just said they wanted to flatten the East China Sea. Come here. I&#x27;m right here. If you&#x27;re so capable, why don&#x27;t you try stepping on one and show me? Behind him, Akasha jumped down as well.</p>
<p>She changed back into her signature black velvet dress and stood beside Shin Yuan, her violet eyes filled with icy killing intent. It seems those old fogies in the family are really getting anxious. Chapter 198. Aunt Katarina, a ripe peach delivered to your door. Shin Yuan and Yu Ling Long stood side by side with Akasha, Ling, L Yu, and Muing Shua behind them.</p>
<p>This group was quite impressive. on the Rothschild family&#x27;s flagship opposite. The aura of the eighth realm expert was formidable, but he clearly hesitated when facing Yu Ling Long and the unfathomable Shinuan. What an arrogant brat. On the flagship&#x27;s deck, an elderly man dressed in golden armor stepped out.</p>
<p>His hair and beard were all white, and he held a scepter wrapped in lightning, staring at Shin Yuan with a sinister look in his eyes. So, you&#x27;re Shinuan? You kidnapped my family&#x27;s heir, and you still dare to be so arrogant? kidnapping. Shin Yuan chuckled, pulled Akasha close, and kissed her on the fair cheek. Old man, you can eat whatever you want, but you can&#x27;t say whatever you want. Ask her who abducted whom.</p>
<p>Akasha leaned against Shun Yuans chest, looking at the old man with a mocking expression in her eyes. Elder Raymond, it&#x27;s been a long time. What didn&#x27;t your aunt tell you? I followed the dragon lord voluntarily. You shameless. Elder Raymond was so angry that his beard trembled.</p>
<p>Lady Katarina had given the order. If you do not turn back, kill me on the spot. Kill. Just then, the flagship&#x27;s hatch slowly opened. A languid yet authoritative female voice came from inside.</p>
<p>Raymond, who gave you the right to talk to Mr. Shin like that? Following the sound, a woman came out. She held a glass of red wine in her hand, wearing a deep purple evening gown that tightly hugged her voluuptuous and mature figure, highlighting the sharp and eye-catching curves of her waist and hips. Every inch of her figure exuding the charm of a mature woman. She looks to be in her 30s, but time has not left any marks on her face.</p>
<p>Instead, it has given her a mature charm that young girls do not possess. Upon seeing this woman, Akasha&#x27;s expression changed slightly, and she whispered in Shun Yuans ear, &quot;The Dragon Lord, that&#x27;s Katarina, my aunt, and also the current acting head of the family.&quot; Oh. Shinuan narrowed his eyes and looked the woman up and down. Top quality. absolutely top-notch.</p>
<p>If Akasha is a black rose with thorns, then Katarina is a ripe peach that bursts with juice with just a gentle squeeze. And Shinuan keenly sensed that there was not a trace of murderous intent in the woman&#x27;s eyes when she looked at him. It also carries a merchant&#x27;s greed and a woman&#x27;s yearning for the strong step down. Katarina walked to the edge of the deck and waved to Raymond. Elder Raymond, who was at the eighth realm, actually obediently concealed his aura and retreated behind her.</p>
<p>Katarina raised her glass and toasted Shin Yuan from afar, her smile impeccable. Mr. Shin Yuan, it&#x27;s a pleasure to meet you. I am Katarina. I am not here to fight, but to deliver a gift.</p>
<p>Gift giving. Shiny Yuan raised an eyebrow. Bringing an aircraft carrier fleet to deliver gifts. The Rothschild family&#x27;s etiquette is truly unique. There&#x27;s no way around it.</p>
<p>Mr. Shin has too many beautiful and accomplished women around him. If I don&#x27;t make a grand entrance, I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t catch his eye.&quot; Katarina chuckled softly and flicked her finger. The hatches of several transport ships behind them opened. Countless huge containers were lifted by a levitation device and sent to the sea.</p>
<p>The box door opened, shining with golden light. Those are mountains of rare energy crystals. There were also various potions and equipment that shimmerred with strange light and even several oddly shaped high-tech instruments. This is 50 million tons of high energy crystals, enough to support the energy consumption of the entire Dongghai city for 10 years. This is a family heirloom of life essence, 100 vials.</p>
<p>Each vial can extend an ordinary person&#x27;s life by 10 years and grant them eternal youth. And that mining rights transfer document from the West Coast. Katarina rattled off the names with ease, each one causing those present to gasp in astonishment. This is an enormous investment. Even Yuling Long couldn&#x27;t help but frown.</p>
<p>What exactly does this woman want to do? Unsolicited kindness is either a sign of malice or theft. Shin Yuan wasn&#x27;t dazzled by the treasures. He looked at Katarina with a half smile. Lady Katarina, just say it. What do you want? Katarina looked at Shun Yuan, her eyes burning even brighter.</p>
<p>Just a touch of your toes. She suddenly flew up and floated towards Shinuan. Raymon tried to stop her, but she stopped him with a look. She flew to Shin Yuan less than 3 m away. Up close, the woman&#x27;s skin was stunningly good, and she exuded a mature and alluring tulip scent.</p>
<p>What I want is very simple. Katarina ignored Akasha&#x27;s almost fiery glare beside her, as well as Yu Ling Longs scrutinizing gaze. She stared intently at Shin Yuan. I heard from Akasha that Mr. Shin&#x27;s talent can transform a person completely.</p>
<p>I want to use all this wealth, even the entire Rothschild family. She took a step forward. Her voluuptuous body almost pressed against Shin Yuan. Mr. Shun, please give me a child instead.</p>
<p>Boom. Dash. The entire sight was petrified. Akasha&#x27;s eyes widened and her mouth opened wide enough to fit an egg. Auntie, are you crazy? She couldn&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>This aunt who had always been her rival for power and was known for her cunning was actually here to steal her man and they&#x27;re even offering to send the entire family as dowy. Shinyuan was also taken aback. He looked at the still attractive yet frighteningly passionate beautiful woman before him and his lips twitched involuntarily. This should he say he&#x27;s too charming or that his fertility is too abnormal? Even the empress daager of an enemy country traveled thousands of miles to deliver that thing. Cough, cough.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan coughed twice tactically, his eyes sweeping over Katarina&#x27;s unfathomable cleavage. That lady, there&#x27;s a waiting list for this. Shin Yuan pointed to Akasha, Ling, L Yu, and Mu Ching Shiua, whom he had just taken in behind him. Look, I&#x27;m at full capacity here, too. However, Shin Yuan changed the subject, saying, &quot;Seeing how sincere you are, I&#x27;ll do it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t cut in line. However, it will cost extra.&quot; Katarina&#x27;s eyes lit up. She didn&#x27;t care at all about whether or not she would have to pay more. She reached out and gently placed her hand on Shun Yuans shoulder, her eyes filled with seductive charm. As long as Mr.</p>
<p>Shan is willing, I&#x27;ll give you anything, including myself. The sea breeze blows. Shin Yuan looked at the ripe peach that had been delivered to his door, then glanced at Akasha, who was stomping her feet in anger, and Yu Ling Long, who had a look of anticipation on her face. I sighed inwardly. this damn charm.</p>
<p>It seems that my time in the East China Sea is destined to be anything but peaceful. Okay, Shin Yuan grabbed Katarina&#x27;s voluuptuous waste and waved his hand. Let&#x27;s go home. Let&#x27;s have a family meeting tonight. Let&#x27;s take a good look at this important matter of family merger.</p>
<p>Chapter 199. This is kidnapping the enemy leader home. East China Sea Theater, the core base of Umbrella Corporation. The place is no longer as desolate and deserted as it once was. The area around the tarmac is now completely packed with people.</p>
<p>Thousands of fully armed elite soldiers, their guns blazing, locked onto the massive landing machine, the Shadow Dragon fighter jet. Meanwhile, high in the sky behind the fighter jets, the Rothschild family steel fleet hovered silently outside the air defense identification zone without making any move to cross the line. Even so, the tense atmosphere on the ground remained unabated. Lie Yun stood at the very front, her facial features almost contorted in pain. Xiao Jingua, standing beside him, had lost his usual bold and unrestrained demeanor, his fierce eyes fixed intently on the cabin door.</p>
<p>Old Xiao, &quot;What exactly is Shinuan up to?&quot; Liun lowered her voice, somewhat frantic, and asked, &quot;The communication just said they brought back the acting clan leader. Is that someone you can just bring back so easily? That&#x27;s a ticking time bomb.&quot; Xiao Xin wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and chuckled dryly. This guy never does things the way things are. But to be fair, I have to admit he&#x27;s got the skills to get that arrogant Rothschild woman to stop the fighting and even obediently send money and supplies. I&#x27;m not impressed.</p>
<p>I think he&#x27;s just incredibly audacious. Leon glared at her husband. Who was that Katarina? She was a ruthless, heartless woman. If they let a wolf into their home, laugh. With the sound of gas being released from the hydraulic rods, the fighter jets hatch opened.</p>
<p>Lie Yun and Xiao Jing tensed up instantly and the fingers of hundreds of special forces soldiers behind them were also on the trigger. However, the scene that came into view made everyone present drop their jaws to the ground. The first to step forward was the exquisite war goddess, dressed in fiery red and exuding unparalleled power. Her face was expressionless, but there was a hint of amusement in her phoenix eyes. Immediately afterwards, Shin Yuan swaggered out.</p>
<p>He was also quite unrefined. His tattered trench coat was nowhere to be found, and he was wearing a priceless looking black and gold men&#x27;s suit jacket, clearly not his size, and the style seemed to belong to some federal nobleman. To his left was Akasha, who had I&#x27;m a little fang girl of the Dragon Lord, etched on her forehead. The key point is his right hand. A well-maintained, plump, and fair arm was naturally linked with Shinuan&#x27;s arm.</p>
<p>It belonged to a stunningly beautiful woman who looked to be in her early 30s. She wore a deep purple hot couture evening gown with a very deep V-neck. The dazzling white cleavage almost blinding in the sunlight. With each step, the high slit of her skirt revealed glimpses of her beautiful legs clad in black stockings. Her mature charm, so alluring that it seemed as if a gentle pinch could drip honey, instantly overshadowed the more youthful Akasha beside her.</p>
<p>She wore an elegant and proper smile, but her eyes were glued to Shin Yuan. Even after getting off the plane, her body was still subtly pressed against Shinuan. Their intimate demeanor made them look like a newlywed couple who had just returned from their honeymoon. This the cigar in Xiao Jinguas hand fell to the ground with a thud. He rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>Was that Katarina? The Rothschild leader who always appears stern, ruthless, and known as the iron lady in international news. This is clearly a female cat in heat. Hey, sister Lee, Uncle Xiao. Shiny Yuan waved from afar, his smile beaming. Don&#x27;t hold up a gun.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s scary. We&#x27;re all on the same side. On the same side. Lean felt like the blood vessels in her brain were about to explode. One of our own.</p>
<p>Who&#x27;s on your side? She rushed forward, grabbed Shin Yuan, and pulled him aside, shouting in a low voice. Shinyuan, are you crazy? This is Katarina, the number one figure in the enemy country. You brought her into the base. Do you think the East China Sea has lived too long? Stay calm. Stay calm.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan patted Le Yun on the shoulder with an expression that said everything was under control. Sister Lee, broaden your perspective. They&#x27;ve come to surrender, bringing with them tens of millions of tons of crystals and a mountain of strategic materials. We should make as many friends as possible and as few enemies as possible. Surrender.</p>
<p>Li Yun laughed in exasperation, glancing at Katarina, who was smiling elegantly at the surrounding special forces soldiers not far away. Look at her. Does she look like she&#x27;s here to surrender? I think she&#x27;s here to squeeze you dry, you fat pig. Ahem. Shinyuan&#x27;s old face flushed red.</p>
<p>What a load of rubbish. That sounds awful. That&#x27;s called personal charisma. At that moment, Katarina walked over with elegant cat-like steps. Ignoring the hostile gazes around her, she walked straight up to Li Yun, bowed slightly, and performed a standard aristocratic greeting.</p>
<p>This must be your company&#x27;s deputy commander, Leon, right? I&#x27;ve heard so much about you. Katarina&#x27;s voice had a unique magnetism that sent shivers down your spine. I am Katarina. I may be bothering you for a while. She turned to look at Shun Yuan, her eyes instantly turning sullen.</p>
<p>Since we&#x27;re family, I won&#x27;t stand on ceremony. Mr. Shan, the supplies I brought have already been unloaded. As for where I&#x27;ll be staying, she licked her red lips, her alluring eyes full of implications. As long as I&#x27;m close to Mr.</p>
<p>Shan, I&#x27;m willing to sleep on the floor. The entire room fell silent. Longing was ready to activate the dragon soul battle body at any moment. And a cold light flashed in Lyus eyes. This is hardly a place to seek refuge.</p>
<p>Dream on. Akasha, who was possessive of her food, couldn&#x27;t hold back any longer and stood between Shin Yuan and Katarina. There&#x27;s no place for you here. They won&#x27;t even let you stay in the warehouse. Haha.</p>
<p>Little Akasha, still so immature. Katarina wasn&#x27;t angry at all. Instead, she covered her mouth and chuckled, her eyes revealing the affection of an elder for a younger person. Your aunt is trying to ease your burden. Can you handle Mr.</p>
<p>Shans sgrey dragon blood all by yourself? You Akasha was speechless. Indeed, she had experienced this firsthand these past few days. The dragon lord&#x27;s stamina was becoming increasingly terrifying, and she was often being slaughtered and routed by him. &quot;All right, all right, let&#x27;s all keep quiet.&quot; Seeing that the situation was about to explode, Shinuan quickly stepped in to smooth things over. &quot;Uncle Xiao, arrange a room for them first, the best kind.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s settle them in first, then we can talk slowly.&quot; Xiao Jingwa glanced at his wife and seeing that Lie Yun had no objection despite her dark expression, he could only nod reluctantly. &quot;Okay, then let&#x27;s arrange for him to stay in the presidential suite in section A.&quot; &quot;No need,&quot; Katarina interrupted him. &quot;I heard Mr. Shan is staying at your company&#x27;s most secure fortress number one. I see there are still rooms available there.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the Dragon Lord&#x27;s palace.&quot; Akasha screamed. Perfect. This will make it convenient to report on work at night. Katarina&#x27;s smile grew even more alluring. Shin Yuan felt several murderous auras locking onto him from behind.</p>
<p>Ling, L Yu, Muing Shua, and even Yuing Long, who had been watching the show, all had a playful look in their eyes. Let&#x27;s decide on that for now. Shin Yuan gritted his teeth. Fortune favors the bold. Since you&#x27;re here, your guests tonight, I&#x27;ll host a welcome dinner for everyone.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, he quickly led the group of powder kegs deeper into the base. Lie watched a group of people leave, especially Katarina&#x27;s swaying. Obviously, ill-intentioned back and felt her temples throbbing. Old Xiao exist. Have the entire intelligence department work overtime.</p>
<p>This woman&#x27;s background is definitely not what it seems. Investigate her thoroughly. Also, raise the base&#x27;s defense level to the highest. I have a feeling this woman isn&#x27;t just here to give birth. Yes.</p>
<p>Chapter 200. Let&#x27;s take action. First, we&#x27;ll make Katarina one of our own. Half an hour later, inside the living room of Shun Yuan&#x27;s extremely luxurious fortress number one, the atmosphere wasn&#x27;t as harmonious as I&#x27;d imagined. Instead, it was eerily quiet.</p>
<p>Katarina didn&#x27;t rush to the room she had stolen. Instead, she sat down in the center of the main sofa with an air of familiarity, her posture indicating that she was the lady of the house. Akasha sat down opposite them, fuming. Ling and Lung Yu stood on either side of Shun Yuan, looking like bodyguards ready to take action at any moment. Muing Shiwa, on the other hand, was somewhat at a loss.</p>
<p>This highle situation was clearly not something she, the newly crowned queen of pop, was used to. Only Yuing Long chose the furthest single sofa, toying with the Crimson Phoenix token in her hand without saying a word. A bystander who remains uninvolved. Mr. Shun.</p>
<p>Katarina swirled her wine glass, breaking the silence. There are no outsiders here. We can speak frankly about some things. Please speak, madam. Shinyuan sat beside her, not blinded by her beauty.</p>
<p>You have already seen the sincerity I brought. Katarina put down her glass, leaned forward, and the scent of tulips wafted over again. But this is just a deposit. If Mr. Shin can help me fulfill that wish.</p>
<p>I can offer him the entire west coast of the Commonwealth or even all of the Rothschild family&#x27;s overseas assets. A wish? Shin Yuan smiled enigmatically. To have children, it&#x27;s not just about having children. Katarina&#x27;s eyes shifted slightly, and the doineering aura of someone accustomed to being in a superior position instantly surfaced. I want to use your seed to create an heir with god-like talent.</p>
<p>Then, with your influence, I&#x27;ll get rid of that old geyser in the family. Oh, Shiny Yuan raised an eyebrow. Akasha sneered from the side, finally showing your true colors. I knew you weren&#x27;t up to any good. You want to use the dragon lord to deal with great grandpa? Are you crazy? Great grandpa is at the peak of the ninth realm.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s only one step away from becoming a 10th realm marshall god. So, what if he&#x27;s at the ninth realm? A glint of madness flashed in Katarina&#x27;s eyes. He&#x27;s old. He&#x27;s held his position for too long. The Rothschilds need new blood.</p>
<p>They need a stronger leader. She turned to look at Shaun Yuan, her eyes full of temptation. Mr. Shan, that old man possesses a secret navigational map to the Seventh Star region, as well as countless artifacts unearthed from ancient ruins. If we join forces, all of these are yours.</p>
<p>Shin Yuan stroked his chin, seemingly weighing the pros and cons. This is indeed a huge piece of fat, a navigational chart to the star system, a divine artifact. This is much more attractive than any crystal mine. But Shin Yuan&#x27;s gaze swept over Katarina&#x27;s voluuptuous body. This woman is too dangerous.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s cunning and ruthless. Cooperating with her is like asking a tiger for its skin. Rather than cooperating, it is better to. A barely concealed malice flashed in Shin Yuans eyes. He suddenly stood up, walked behind Katarina, and boldly placed his hands on her rounded shoulders.</p>
<p>The lady&#x27;s suggestion did indeed sound very appealing. Shin Yuan lowered his head, his lips brushing against her earlobe, his voice low and deep. However, since we&#x27;re family, talking about a deal would be too formal. I&#x27;m not interested in those magical artifacts. I&#x27;m only interested in the lady.</p>
<p>Katarina stiffened, then relaxed, grasping Shin Yuans hand in return and smiling seductively. Mr. Shan can take it anytime he wants. Good. Shin Yuan laughed loudly, then suddenly winked at Longing and Lung Yu in the distance.</p>
<p>That was a pre-arranged code signal. Move. Kidnapping. Now that this woman has come to us, why should we let her go? No matter what schemes or tricks you have, just detain the person and sew the seeds of good fortune. If they become one of his own, then the Rothschild family will still belong to him.</p>
<p>This move is called catching a turtle in a jar. Ling and Lyu instantly understood. Plank. Longing transformed her hand into a blade, and a sharp burst of energy instantly locked onto Katarina&#x27;s throat. Two ice swords appeared in Lung Yus hands, pointing directly at Katarina&#x27;s brow.</p>
<p>At the same time, Shinuan suddenly exerted force on Katarina&#x27;s shoulders. The power of the S-class dragon blood erupted, gripping her collarbone. &quot;Excuse me, madam.&quot; Shinuan grinned, revealing a set of white teeth. &quot;Since you&#x27;re here, you&#x27;re not leaving. Let&#x27;s change the way we conduct this family meeting.&quot; The change happened in an instant.</p>
<p>Akasha jumped up excitedly, her palms glowing with crimson light, ready to deliver the final blow at any moment. She had wanted to get rid of this annoying ant for a long time. However, faced with this sudden attack and Shun Yuan&#x27;s terrifying strength capable of crushing alloys. Despite being restrained, Katarina showed no sign of panic. She maintained her elegant posture, not even spilling a drop of red wine.</p>
<p>She merely turned her head slightly, looking at Shin Yuan, who was so close to her. Her beautiful, alluring eyes held not fear, but rather a hint of mockery. &quot;Mr. Shan, your way of treating guests is a little rude,&quot; Katarina said softly. The next second, &quot;Buzz!&quot; An extremely obscure yet powerful aura that made one&#x27;s soul tremble suddenly erupted from Katarina&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>&quot;That was not her power. That was a will.&quot; Boom! Shin Yuan felt as if his hands were gripping a red-hot iron, and a terrifying force of recoil shot through his arm straight to his heart. Shin Yuan grunted, his entire body being forcefully thrown back three steps by this force. The blade energy that Longing unleashed shattered just 3 in from Katarina. As if it had encountered an invisible wall, L used two ice swords hovered in midair before turning into dust.</p>
<p>What? Shin Yuan steadied himself. his golden vertical pupils contracting sharply. A faint golden light appeared around Katarina&#x27;s body. Countless complex runes faintly flowed across the light barrier. And that aura, that&#x27;s the power of the ninth realm, or even the power of a demagod at the peak of the ninth realm.</p>
<p>Is this the family&#x27;s guardian seal? Akasha, standing nearby, exclaimed in shock, great grandpa actually planted the holy seal on you. How is that possible? That&#x27;s a method that consumes your very essence. Katarina stood up gracefully, straightened her slightly wrinkled skirt, and her smile, though still charming, now carried a chilling air of composure. Akasha, you&#x27;re still too young. Katarina shook her head.</p>
<p>Since I&#x27;m venturing into the lion&#x27;s den, how could I not make some preparations? She glanced at Shun Yuan reproachfully, but it was more like she was admiring a mischievous little wild beast. Mr. Shan, this sacred seal was personally left behind by that ancestor. Unless you are at the peak of the ninth realm or a star lord of the 10th realm, no one can harm me in the slightest. Moreover, with a light tap of her fingertip, the light shield slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>If I am ever placed under a mortal threat, this holy seal will erupt in full force. At that point, not only this fortress, but the entire base will likely be raised to the ground. This Shin Yuan felt a chill run down his spine. This isn&#x27;t just about capturing a beauty. It&#x27;s like bringing back a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s the kind of smart nuclear bomb that&#x27;s programmed to explode when attacked. Jade exquisite. Shinuan suddenly turned his head and looked at the woman who had been sitting in the corner watching the show and began to frantically plead for help with his eyes. Big sister, you&#x27;re an eighth realm marshall emperor. Why didn&#x27;t you make a move earlier? Now, only you can break this situation, right? Yuling Long sat there steadily, holding a teacup in her hand.</p>
<p>A clear cold voice resounded directly in Shun Yuan&#x27;s mind. A mental transmission from an eighth realm expert. Don&#x27;t look at me. That holy seal is indeed the primordial power left behind by that old codger. If I had forced my way through just now, I might have been able to break it.</p>
<p>But the aftershock of that explosion would have instantly turned you and all your little lovers into dust. Moreover, Yu Ling Longs voice carried a hint of shot and Freuda. Since that old man dared to let her bring the holy seal, he must have had a backup plan. Once this seal is broken, he will be able to sense it immediately from the Federation&#x27;s side and will be able to use the seal to directly tear through space and descend. Do you want to start a war with a ninth realm demagod right now in the East China Sea? Shinyuan felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>Damn it, why didn&#x27;t you say so earlier? Shinyuan roared inwardly. You didn&#x27;t even ask. Yuing Long replied with absolute certainty. Besides, judging from the way you were so eager to take advantage of her just now, you didn&#x27;t seem like you wanted to listen to advice. Shinuan, this woman definitely did it on purpose.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s definitely getting revenge for the time I took off her shoes and touched her toes last time for teasing her. The current situation is extremely awkward. Should we fight? We mustn&#x27;t. Once that holy seal is triggered, we&#x27;re all doomed. Hurry.</p>
<p>How do we hurry? They came with tens of millions of tons of supplies and they were also surrendering. If they were to turn their backs on them now, it would not only make Donghai seem petty, but more importantly, Shin Yuan would be reluctant to give up such a lucrative opportunity once it was within his grasp. That&#x27;s the Rothschild family&#x27;s estate.</p>
