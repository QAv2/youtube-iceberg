            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this channel is all about education and it&#x27;s about education of uh things that are important but unsung things that uh mainly uh subjects that are all-encompassing theories of everything cosmologies that nobody&#x27;s ever heard of or very few people have heard of and uh even fewer have any kind of detailed understanding of them I also like to let the authors speak for themselves so I do a lot of reading directly from the text um and intersperse a little bit of analysis uh some sometimes there today I believe today is the 152nd video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory that was derived in the 20th century by Dewey B Larson started his work way back in 1930 or so and it took him about 20 years where he still had his day job and so on um just kind of working out the Kinks uh through induction [Music] um trying to figure out uh how to take his uh his ideas and put them into uh boil them down he boiled them down to two fundamental postulates in about the late 1950s and then took those two fundamental postulates and um created an entire theoretical Universe from those postulates through deduction you know if this is true then this is true well if this is true then this is true I did about 15 videos earlier this year on his uh his talk called the deductive development of the reciprocal system and it shows all I think 165 steps that he took to derive that that theoretical universe and then what he does is he takes his theoretical universe and matches it up with the actual Universe um that the scientists have measured empirically um he uh that theoretical Universe you know when he when he makes those steps those what comes out of that they&#x27;re not they don&#x27;t have labels attached to them it doesn&#x27;t say okay well if this then that and this is a simple harmonic motion well that&#x27;s a mathematical term for it but what uh you know do the scientists have anything that they that corresponds with this and so he has to figure out what the scientists have come up with that actually corresponds to what he&#x27;s come up with in some cases there is nothing in other cases there is so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s kind of how he works his system he wrote uh a dozen or more books on every subject that he could get his hands on uh again it&#x27;s a system of theory so if you understand his system then you can apply it to any subject he applied it to physics astrophysics chemistry astronomy metaphysics economics and uh you know to a lesser extent other topics um other people have attempted to apply it to things like uh archeology and a crypto history um you know uh spirituality and uh Larson did dabble in that also psychology dream interpretation uh many other things but if you understand the system you can apply it to whatever you want to apply it to not an easy task it&#x27;s not easy to understand the system but um the basic gist of it is that um in Larson&#x27;s Universe the universe is not made out of matter and it&#x27;s not made out of energy the universe is made out of motion and other people have come up with that in the past but what distinguishes Larson is that he defined emotion as the relationship between space and time this defines a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time and then uh you know through the postulates he determined that uh space and time are I they have the same qualities they&#x27;re the same thing except that there are inversions of one another uh reciprocal relationship it same as like two-thirds and three halves are reciprocal relationship but they both have the same qualities two and three but they one is the inversion of the other uh and uh you can abstract time and space um similar to maybe what you would do with Calculus where you&#x27;re um you know you&#x27;re taking a snapshot of something it doesn&#x27;t really exist but if you take enough of those snapshots then uh you put them all together and you can get a curve um with time and space they don&#x27;t really exist other than together in motion space and time do not really exist other than together in motion so motion is always a fraction that is a partly space and partly time and all scientific phenomena including Manner and energy are fractions of space and time like so in Larson&#x27;s system energy is time over space and matter is time to the third power over space to the third power because both time and space have three or more Dimensions uh Larson calls this coordinate space and coordinate time and time and space are also progressing they&#x27;re always time is always getting later and later Larson calls that clock time and so too the space is always getting farther and farther apart uh Larson calls that clock space and that was detected by the Hubble telescope in the recession of the distant galaxies all the distant galaxies are moving away from each other that Larson calls a scalar motion uh scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no Direction which you can visualize by using a magic marker on a balloon you blow up the balloon and uh put a bunch of dots on the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other that is a visualization of a scalar motion all of the galaxies would represent a DOT on that surface of the balloon you could fill in the in interior of the balloon as well okay now we are looking at his 1979 book right now called Nothing But motion and this book covers primarily physics um with a little organic chemistry thrown in at the end and uh we are in chapter five where he&#x27;s talking about gravitation and uh I think we just left off where he was uh he was kind of showing how gravitation uh fits uh one of these analogies that he has um uh and it&#x27;s very useful to do his visualizations that he kind of presents you with even if you have to go over this very slowly you can rewind me and uh play it over and over again until you kind of can visualize what he&#x27;s talking about um and uh so he was he was also introducing what he called the gravitational limit so there&#x27;s it gravitation is really an inward scalar motion whereas the progression of the natural reference system is an outward scalar motion so gravity can be visualized like taking that balloon and sucking it in where all of the all of the distant galaxies are moving toward each other that is a scalar motion and it appears as if they&#x27;re attracting each other but each one is actually just pursuing its own independent course but they all do it in a chorus and so it appears as if they&#x27;re attracting to one another okay so we&#x27;re going to let Larson take over right here all Aggregates of matter smaller than the largest largest existing units are under the gravitational control of the larger Aggregates that is they are within the gravitational limits of those larger units consequently they are not able to continue the outward movement that would take place in the absence of the larger bodies the largest existing Aggregates are not limited in this manner and on the basis of the principles that have been stated any two such Aggregates that are outside their Mutual gravitational limits recede from each other at speeds increasing with the distance in The observed physical Universe the largest Aggregates of matter are galaxies according to the foregoing theoretical findings the distant galaxies should be receding from the earth at extremely high speeds increasing with distance up to the speed of light which will be reached where the gravitational effect is reduced to a negligible level now remember the um I didn&#x27;t go over this but the progression of the natural reference system is outward at the speed of light then the speed of light is one unit of space over one unit of time uh one and uh the progression is always there ubiquitous it&#x27;s so what we&#x27;re experiencing is an outward movement at the speed of light in all directions at all times but when there is a gravitational effect the gravitational effect can cancel out that um that progression depending on its kind of its strength and so the further these things are away from each other the more attenuated gravity becomes and then the more um the progression shows itself uh if things are close enough together then the gravitational effect over rules the progression and things or uh appear to be moving toward each other instead of away from each other so that&#x27;s kind of what he&#x27;s talking about here we&#x27;ll go back the the largest Aggregates or matter are galaxies according to the foregoing theoretical findings the distant galaxies should be receding from the earth at extremely high speeds increasing with distance up to the speed of light which will be reached where the gravitational effect is reduced to a negligible level until quite recently this theoretical conclusion would have been received with extreme skepticism as it conflicts with what was then the accepted thinking and there was no way in which it could be subjected to a test but recent astronomical advances have changed this situation present-day instruments are able to reach out to distances so great that the effect of gravitation is minimal and the observations with this improved equipment show that the galaxies are behaving in exactly the manner predicted by the new Theory in the meantime however the astronomers have been trying to account for this Galactic recession in some manner consistent with present astronomical views and they have devised an explanation in which they assume entirely ad hoc that there was an enormous explosion the Big Bang at some singular point in the past history of the universe which hurled the galaxies out into space at their present fantastically high speeds if one were to be called upon to decide which is the better explanation one which rests upon an ad hoc Assumption of an event far out of the range of known physical phenomenon or one which finds the recession to be an immediate and direct consequence of the fundamental nature of the universe there can hardly be any question as to the decision but in reality this question does not arise as the case in favor of the theory of a universe of motion is not based on the contention that it provides better explanations of physical phenomena a contention that would have to depend in most instances on Conformity with non-scientific criteria but on the objective and genuinely scientific contention that it is a fully integrated system of theory which is not inconsistent with any established fact in any physical area another significant effect of the existence of a gravitational limit within which there is a net inward motion and outside of which there is a net outward progression is that it reconciles the seemingly uniform distribution of matter in the universe with Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation and euclidean geometry one of the strong arguments that has been Advanced against the existence of a gravitational force of the inverse Square type operating in a euclidean universe is that on such a basis quote the Stellar Universe ought to be a finite island in the infinite ocean of space as Einstein stated the case observations indicate that there is no such concentration so far as we can tell the galaxies are distributed uniformly or nearly uniformly throughout the immense region now accessible to observation and this is currently taken as a depth definite indication that the UI the geometry of the universe is non-euclidean now uh just to mention uh that is a big part of Larson&#x27;s second fundamental postulate uh the Universe um I can&#x27;t remember exactly what it says but the universe conforms to the relationships of ordinary commutative mathematics it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s uh magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean so Larson postulates euclidean geometry even after Einstein and his crew uh pretty much you know started proposing things like curved space and stuff but uh one of Larson&#x27;s followers um Bruce Dr Bruce Perrette late Dr Bruce Perrette disagreed with Larson&#x27;s uh euclidean geometry uh postulate and he pretty much rejected the entire second postulate and um there are only two of the postulates the first one is that the universe is made out of motion emotion is the relationship between space and time and space and time are reciprocals of each other they both have three uh dimensions and they have uh they come in discrete units but the second one about the euclidean geometry peret replaced that with projective geometry now projective geometry is not a non-euclidean geometry per projective geometry includes euclidean geometry but euclidean geometry is just a small subset of projective geometry there&#x27;s a what you call a geometrical Cascade from projective geometry to a fine geometry to metric geometry to euclidean geometry and this Cascade is what peret is really proposing for that second postulate okay back to Larson from the points uh brought out in the preceding Pages it is now clear that the flaw in this argument is that it rests on the assumption that there is a net gravitational force effective throughout space our findings are that this assumption is incorrect and that there is a net gravitational force only within the gravitational limit of the particular mass under consideration on this basis it is only the matter with within the gravitational limit that should agglomerate into a single unit and this is exactly what occurs each major Galaxy is a finite island in the ocean of space within its gravitational limit the existing situation is thus entirely consistent with the inverse Square gravitation operating in a euclidean universe as the reciprocal system requires the atoms particles and larger Aggregates of matter within the gravitational limit of each Galaxy constitute a gravitationally bound system each of these constituent units is subject to the same two general forces as the galaxies but in addition is subject to the apparent gravitational attractive attraction of neighboring masses and that of the entire Mass within the gravitational limits acting as a whole under the combined influence of all of these forces each aggregate assumes an equilibrium position in the three-dimensional reference system that we are calling extension space or a net motion capable of representation in that system so far as the bound system is concerned the coordinate reference system extension space is the equivalent of Newton&#x27;s absolute space it can be generalized to include other gravitationally bound systems by taking into account the relative motion of the systems any or all of the Aggregates or individual units that constitute a gravitationally bound system May acquire motions relative to the fixed reference System since these motions are relative to the defined spatial coordinate system the direction of motion Motion in each instance is an inherent property of the motion rather than being merely a matter of chance as in the case of the coordinate representation of the scalar motions these motions with inherent vectorial directions are vectorial motions the Motions of our ordinary experience they are so familiar that it is customary to generalize their characteristics and to assume that these are the characteristics of all motion inasmuch as these familiar vectorial motions have inherent directions and are always motions of something it is taken for granted that these are essential features of motions that all motions must necessarily have these same properties but our investigation of the fundamental properties of motion reveals that this assumption is in error motion as it exists in a universe composed entirely of motion is merely a relation between space and time and it&#x27;s in its simpler forms is not a motion of anything nor does it have an inherent Direction vectorial motion is a special kind of motion a Phenom phenomenon of the gravitationally bound system okay we&#x27;ll leave it there thanks for tuning in uh we&#x27;ll finish this chapter tomorrow have a great day</p>
