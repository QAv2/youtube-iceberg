            <p>free energy Zero Point Energy vacuum energy today&#x27;s episode we&#x27;re going to learn what those terms mean I brought on Ashton Forbes you may know from the MH370 videos to understand what this episode is going to be about I thought I&#x27;d show a clip from a renowned expert talking about it what&#x27;s Zero Point Energy Zero Point Energy is a technology that&#x27;s been around for a long time that&#x27;s been kind of dark shelf and buried that you could take energy from the vacuum in space to power everything we need okay that was Fred dur from Limp Biscuit but he makes a really good point right check out these other Clips the technology to create unlimited clean free energy has existed for over a 100 years it&#x27;s your your um your tea glass there that mug mhm the amount of potential energy and the space in that mug is enough energy to boil off all the oceans of the earth our Engineers are taught to throw away about 10 trillion times for a typical average case as much energy as they pull out of the vacuum without even knowing it in a generator and a battery so without further Ado let&#x27;s welcome Ashton Forbes to vetted enjoy got Ashton in the house we&#x27;re going to be talking free energy what does that mean I don&#x27;t have to pay for energy anymore I honestly don&#x27;t know what that means I probably will get it wrong if I try to describe it so brought ashon on we could talk about what what this means and how he&#x27;s involved and what he&#x27;s got coming up with it I find it very fascinating and I cannot wait for this conversation so let&#x27;s jump in what&#x27;s up Ashton hey Pat how&#x27;s it going man awesome man so excited to talk about this dude um what what do I like when I hear free energy I think oh like just my electricity bills gone like what does that mean free energy exactly yeah it&#x27;s a great way to start um because free energy is a bit of a misnomer uh which is why I&#x27;ve been using the term overunity or Zero Point Energy uh okay because a lot of people think free energy and they think oh well you know you&#x27;re just gonna have energy for free um but that&#x27;s kind of true I guess but it&#x27;s more of like you know the solar panels also produce free energy right I mean they produce energy and you don&#x27;t have to do anything but the solar panels still cost lots of money I mean they have uh you know discounts and what have you subsidies but they still cost a bunch of money the same is true of free energy so in free energy we&#x27;re not talking about you know here&#x27;s energy for free although it is similar to the idea of solar panels it&#x27;s more of the idea that we can extract energy from our environment all around us and it&#x27;s not like wind and solar where it&#x27;s like we have this wind power and solar power it&#x27;s more of like extracting the latent energy that&#x27;s all around us all the time so for example dark energy is something that we don&#x27;t really understand but we know that the Universe must have been able to expand faster than the speed of light I personally believe that there&#x27;s a connection between dark energy and Zero Point Energy so Zero Point Energy would say at the lowest rest levels at like absolute zero there&#x27;s still stuff going on and physics would say that you have these Quantum fluctuations in the vacuum that occurring and that we have these virtual particles popping in and out of existence well what is a virtual particle where does that come from this is why I brought back the idea of the space-time ether because space isn&#x27;t a empty vacuum there is this latent Zero Point Energy we know it&#x27;s there it&#x27;s been proven experimentally it exists the experiment that Prov I have heard that about space having like you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s not just empty there&#x27;s something going on there and that&#x27;s yeah okay in convention physics you know going back uh many years I mean there&#x27;s always been people that have promoted the idea of Zero Point Energy for decades but you know conventional physics would look back and say that they just they negate it they say that there&#x27;s not there&#x27;s not enough there so they just zero it out but the universe is extremely big so even if there&#x27;s a very tiny amount you were to add it up throughout the whole universe you&#x27;re gonna have this huge amount of energy out there now the experiment that proves it is the Casmir effect Casmir effect is a major player that people should remember because if you take two plates uh I believe the semiconductive plates put them close together to one another very close together there&#x27;s this attractive force that causes them to to suck together which would be a negative energy density that occurs and then the question is well where is that energy for that Force coming from you know it&#x27;s coming from the zero point fluctuations the explanation is that the wavelengths that are too small to fit between the plates when they&#x27;re very close together is what&#x27;s uh the fact that the wavelengths are larger than the distance between them means they can&#x27;t fit between and so then you have this different differential of the pressure on the outside versus the one what&#x27;s in the inside so you can imagine just conceptually like if you could tap into that you know if you could create something that could utilize that uh then you could theoretically get energy from nowhere from all around us so that&#x27;s overall idea wow if you suspend two uncharged metal plates in a perfect vacuum you&#x27;d expect both plates to stay completely still in reality though the plates would slightly move towards each other this is the chasmier effect see behind the classical view of this example there&#x27;s the Quantum View here the quantum fields of different fundamental particles are constantly interacting with each other although this interplay of fields is complicated to fully understand the resulting effect is that there are infantes small reactions occurring on the subatomic scale we call these reactions virtual particles these particle-like entities pop in and out of existence barely ever being a part of our reality however as they interact with each other they produce extremely small forces When taking into account that there&#x27;s almost an infinite amount of these virtual particles their combined Force becomes quite substantial and since there&#x27;s more space on either side of the metal plates than in between them the virtual particles exert a net force that pushes the plates towards each other so even in a vacuum the universe announces itself through the Casmir effect when did this or you know historically it may be hard to determine but historically like how long has have people been you said decades like when did someone first like think of this idea I think if you watched the the best video I watched recent I think you watched it as well was the wi Files episode on free energy great episode yeah so awesome dude in that episode Floyd sweet uh was had a little like in the middle of it you have Tom Bearden is actually narrating it Thomas Bearden you know I dug into him from the MH370 videos and found out that this guy&#x27;s been talking about scaler physics and free energy for you know 40 years ago he passed away a couple years ago as well but he was out there with Floyd s looking at this device that was running five 100 watt bulbs in a fan and it was just this little box that he had over there now most people try to debunk these types of claims and say that well there must be a a battery or a hidden wire because people generally can&#x27;t debunk the devices themselves um and so I would argue that this has been around for maybe over 50 years maybe as long as going back to Tesla I mean even Tesla could have figured it out because in that documentary and also Patrick B David did a documentary as well and they point out correctly that JP Morgan was the investor in Tesla and that he didn&#x27;t invest in this idea of free energy or over Unity because you couldn&#x27;t put a meter on it you know you couldn&#x27;t sell it to any because technically if you have a device that&#x27;s a free energy device an overunity device and I just want to clarify the definition of overunity is coefficient or performance greater than one what that means is that you&#x27;re you&#x27;re putting some energy in but you&#x27;re getting more energy out than what you&#x27;re putting into your device got it and that&#x27;s possible because there&#x27;s a third input or the second input an input from the energy all around us from The Ether if you want to think of it from the Zero Point Energy field Etc and then that the interesting part about that is it means that your device doesn&#x27;t have to be 100% efficient because you have this input coming in and you have this input and these two add up to one another and even if it&#x27;s 90% efficient as long as these two times 90% is greater than one you&#x27;re getting over Unity you&#x27;re getting coefficient performance greater than one so okay I don&#x27;t know exactly what kind of device Floyd sweet used but if you look back there &#x27;s been all kinds of different devices that have claimed to be able to produce over unity in fact cold fusion I believe is a form of overunity as well these toac tokomak reactors they say oh for like 30 seconds or a minute they were able to produce coefficient or performance of greater than one more energy out than what it took to put into it I would argue that cold fusion is another form of extracting energy from the Z point energy field and I think there&#x27;s multiple ways to pull this off think that you might be able to abuse the Casmir effect which would be something that&#x27;s probably like um a device that doesn&#x27;t have any moving parts so the hulum generator is one example that Dr Greer has promoted I checked out their website it doesn&#x27;t have like a ton of you know specifications but it does talk about there not being any moving Parts with it in it so you can imagine Dr G did a great documentary too the Lost Cent yeah I watched that recently too yeah that&#x27;s three document people should watch if people want to know about free energy because like it&#x27;s making a resarch I&#x27;ll put the links in the description for that for sure uh yeah I&#x27;ve watched all three of those and the Patrick David I know it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about I watched that too you&#x27;re right that was that was great and he just interviewed Dr Greer as well recently and um I watched uh not I don&#x27;t think I watched the whole thing but I watched at least like the second half of it which was also really good because talks about Zero Point Energy I mean people have been talking about it openly um and we&#x27;ll talk here a minute about the science behind it and how it&#x27;s possible uh just to debunk any other rebunk any other Notions that it&#x27;s not possible um and generally what I would say is that when you&#x27;ve had these ideas that been around for as long as these ideas have been 40 50 hundred years like there&#x27;s most likely something to it it&#x27;s not a situation probably where these people were all just coming up independently with this idea and then they&#x27;re all wrong you know it&#x27;s kind of like in ufology they say that uh you only needed to be right one time you know if you drive one time then it proves that it&#x27;s all possible and in my belief is that you know the sun could very well be proof that overunity is possible by itself you know um if the sun itself is you know producing more energy out than what&#x27;s taking in or you could argue that the reason why the sun can last as long as it it&#x27;s lasting is because it&#x27;s somehow tapping into the Zero Point Energy field uh we just don&#x27;t know enough about the sun in general but um yeah that&#x27;s interesting yeah and I called Fusion could theoretically be producing it so I don&#x27;t know for a fact uh that that&#x27;s the case but I would say that there&#x27;s probably then at least three different ways just off the top of my head that overunity can be produced which would be cold fusion would be one of them which is you know the power of the Sun in the Palm your hand um the idea of abusing the Casmir uh force and Casmir effect you know maybe you make like a coil or something like that that like you know has some type of oscillation or something like that or I&#x27;m not really sure maybe there&#x27;s another way to pull it off Thomas Bearden had something called the Meg and there&#x27;s a 15minute or 30 minute video where he talks about it he even goes into detail about why it&#x27;s not been able to be commercialized or brought public um and the difficulties and challenges associated with it which primarily because a lot of people say like if this is real why have people not been able to produce them and I would say first of all they have been able to produce them uh but there&#x27;s Economic and Business limitations first of all if you patent it you may get hit by the invention secrecy Act of 19 yes I wanted to bring that up because that was like what like yeah yeah we just have this like we have this law that&#x27;s like if you put out anything that like threatens National Security we can just steal your patent it&#x27;s imminent domain of your ideas right it instead of land it&#x27;s like well we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll take your ideas um and it&#x27;s a real thing 100% so and that&#x27;s scary yeah and so you know they could just take your patent if you try to patent it um they could theoretically kill you or silence you in some other way but then there&#x27;s another big limitation there&#x27;s actually two other limitations one is just how do you make it economical like okay let&#x27;s say I can make a hulc generator but now it costs $500,000 who&#x27;s gonna buy that like maybe companies might buy that and they might be quiet about it but individuals you can&#x27;t really afford that you know and I think that a lot of these devices are like I just looked at like the whole what&#x27;s the point of getting that then you know my bill for my life is it going to be $500,000 my electric bill that that would be so that&#x27;s the big rub right so that&#x27;s the thing is that there&#x27;s this economic barrier to entry which is how do you make it makes sense for somebody because if it&#x27;s so expensive that you&#x27;re not going to make your money back you know then it&#x27;s a problem like even solar panels I think some of them cost upwards of 30,000 or more 100% that&#x27;s a great example and they finance them and then it&#x27;s like okay well you&#x27;re G to save a bunch of money but you have to do the math and figure it out the same is true for free energy devices overunity devices because it&#x27;s not going to be free and then the next barrier entry Thomas Bearden talks about this as well is that there&#x27;s only so many people that know how to build them and these people are generally extremely well-compensated already a lot of them are already working for private military contractors and so if they&#x27;re working for those P pmc&#x27;s that&#x27;s short for private military contractors oh I like that that&#x27;s a new term okay yeah PMC I like it look it too I&#x27;m not big on acronyms generally but there we go so if you hear me using PMC that that&#x27;s it I love but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re very well compensated there&#x27;s only a few of them like from my research into like the MH370 stuff in science like we&#x27;re not talking even we&#x27;re not even talking thousands of people I don&#x27;t even think we&#x27;re talking hundreds like I think we&#x27;re talking dozens so there&#x27;s only a few dozen people that can even engineer these devices and they&#x27;re all already well compensated Thomas be talks about it&#x27;s like how are you gon to entice one of these people to make devices for you they you know and they&#x27;re already other under these other ndas and they don&#x27;t want to risk other stuff as well so these are the main reasons why it&#x27;s very difficult to bring these types of things to Market so just to rehash the three main ways that I know of that I believe are all viable are cold fusion um then some type of manipulation of Casmir Force which would be like probably no moving parts and then the idea of a magnetic motor so uh there&#x27;s been several different versions of magnetic motors that are out there and I think that a lot of people naturally go magnetis should have some kind of connection to this right because we can see some pretty cool things with magnetism and you&#x27;ll see a lot of videos on on social media where they like use magnets to make something you know spin or whatever like that sure um and I think that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s definitely something there on some of those but I think that there&#x27;s a little bit more to it than simply like you know getting your your motor to spin because generally if you do that if you attach a load to it it&#x27;s going to end up slowing down so the biggest and just full full disclosure the I started uh a company ether Tech which is technically an energy consulting company um but we are selling uh overunity devices that are magnetic motors that&#x27;s about as much detail as I can go into I did post a video of a magnetic motor that is call it like a a similar version to the version that we&#x27;re selling that&#x27;s out there um but so you&#x27;re going to be selling a free energy device technically I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not going to call it free energy because throws a lot of people off on that front oh okay okay yeah and and and the people that I&#x27;m working with have already sold many of these behind the scenes and like they&#x27;re only doing this because a like they&#x27;ve seen the attention that I&#x27;ve got from promoting the science that&#x27;s out there um and then for B it&#x27;s like they want to help get this information out there as well um and and get the devices out there to people so that people can realize that it&#x27;s possible um and the benefit of this device is that it&#x27;s probably not as expensive as like a hulc generator is but I think it&#x27;s probably still more expensive than like solar panels are so I think that there is it&#x27;s not going to be for everybody right away but like my true hope is that if we can begin to commercialize it then we can improve the design get the cost down and and sounds like rockets like like what&#x27;s what you know what what uh mus did with Tesla right like he realized you got bring the cost down of these Rockets right so I get your point here like also electric cars I mean he did electric cars too right like electric cars have forever but we only like when would Tesla even start like 10 15 years ago it&#x27;s not even that old of a company and everybody was you know Short Selling Tesla and betting against Tesla and all this stuff as well um but that&#x27;s a lot of people would say well you just open source it but if you&#x27;ve been listening to the discussion so far that&#x27;s not really how it works cuz not anybody can just produce these devices out of nowhere like um you know you first of all have to have the right design and then you have to be able to tune it correctly Thomas beardon talks about this a lot in the Meg video where it&#x27;s like you can make the right device with the right materials and you will have this extra energy that&#x27;s being extracted from the environment but you have to capture it you have to capture that energy so that it then can be used as coefficient of performance greater than one one the idea that this machine would be like something you plug into your house or like how does this work like yeah no great question so the the device that we are selling like technically you need some input to get it going uh and once it starts going then it starts to produce coefficient performance greater than one so that could be that you plug it in for a second and then once the uh magnetic motor starts going you unplug it and then it just runs forever um and then there&#x27;s but then how does that power your house like yeah so you can hook it up to your circuit breaker uh or you can also uh you can set it up to have like build in a plug into it so there&#x27;s like an outlet like AC energy and then you can just plug right in now of course the limitation there would be how much energy it&#x27;s producing right you can&#x27;t if you put too much load on it then you&#x27;re gonna you&#x27;re not gonna be able to power everything that you that you have so um the neat thing is it can be scaled up or down so right now the reason why we&#x27;ve just started our Alpha rollout stage um and we&#x27;re only looking for a few people initially to get involved in it we&#x27;re not really we&#x27;re not trying to be famous and we&#x27;re not trying to be like billionaires off this we&#x27;re just trying to get the the devices and information out there to people because would this be the first time this has ever happened no I think this has probably happened before and I&#x27;ve been told as well just through other sources that I have that um you know I I already just mentioned the people that I work with have already sold like 30 of these devices behind the scenes they&#x27;re not the only ones who are doing this either other people are selling them behind the scenes as well and it&#x27;s probably I don&#x27;t know this for a fact but it&#x27;s probably like those other private military contractor Engineers that the people that know that it&#x27;s possible that are smart and I think that everybody probably has their own designs like I imagine the the one that we&#x27;re selling is roughly around coefficient of performance to which is people would say just completely impossible and incredible but I think that it goes way higher than that like might wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if you people can make ones that are like coefficient performance five or 10 which is just insane amounts of energy um because you know that&#x27;s are you saying that&#x27;s like 10 times the amount that&#x27;s going in oh wow and this is what I would say to people is that the people that want to get it figured out and I&#x27;ve like I signed an NDA with the people that I&#x27;ve been working with because the people you&#x27;re building this with you mean is that what you mean yeah the people that and I mean I&#x27;m mostly a salesperson but I&#x27;m also somebody who&#x27;s trying to learn the engineering side at the same time I mean I think anybody who&#x27;s a good businessman should be trying to learn how the how their product for good salesman you know your product too right like of course yeah exactly exactly um uh what oh yeah so what I say is like I think that for people that want to know figure out how to do it themselves what I would say to kind of give people a hint at least and this is just my opinion not anything related to the NDA is that I wouldn&#x27;t try to make a device that has no power input at all a lot of people when they think free energy and over Unity they think well I want something that has no power input that&#x27;s when they try to get with the magnets and they try to make it so the wheel spins see what you okay I get it having power input&#x27;s fine as long as you get something it yeah okay I the thing is too is like let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m just GNA make up some numbers here sure let&#x27;s say it takes a 100 watts of power in but it produces 200 watts of power out coefficient of performance 2.0 then you take a 100 P 100 of the Watts that are going out and you feed it back in to the input now what&#x27;s happening you&#x27;re getting 100 ex Watts out well no it&#x27;s not going to duplicate it like that but basically what it&#x27;s doing is it&#x27;s using the 200 out and it&#x27;s powering itself right because it only Tak I see that&#x27;s how I would have people think about overunity and that&#x27;s also how like cold fusion works as well is they say well cold fusion takes some power to get the fusion started but then it&#x27;s producing more out than it&#x27;s getting in as well that&#x27;s how I would try to approach any free energy uh device at all is that I wouldn&#x27;t try to make it just like zero input and then output coming out that&#x27;s where I think a lot of people get stuck is try to make it where you have some input coming in but you&#x27;re getting more out than that and then so it&#x27;s perpetual it just recycles on itself and keeps going exactly and so then people would ask well how do you turn it off it&#x27;s actually really simple to turn it off is that so you have that feed and it&#x27;s going back with a hammer Sledgehammer y&#x27;all you just no you just uh you you cut off the the output that&#x27;s going back into the input if you if you put a switch in there then it&#x27;s G to slow down if it&#x27;s a motor it&#x27;s going to stop and so you you just have a switch like that and then it&#x27;ll slow down then it&#x27;ll stop and if you need to start back up again you either just plug it back in again or uh the magnetic motor situations usually do have a battery but it&#x27;s not a battery that is like you&#x27;re not cheating the system it&#x27;s that you want to have the energy that you&#x27;re creating get stored somewhere um and I imagine in the future like over Unity devices in general as they get better and better they&#x27;ll always be paired with something like the Tesla W wall battery and and other people have similar products because you&#x27;re not always using the exact amount of energy that it&#x27;s producing and in fact there might be times where like you&#x27;re sleeping and you&#x27;re producing like you&#x27;re using like no energy and you just want the thing to be charging up the battery right and then in times of need you can use the excess energy you need um so a lot of these devices do end up having like a battery Associated to them but it&#x27;s not the battery that they&#x27;re um it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a cheating the battery that&#x27;s it&#x27;s running off of type situation are you guys going to offer like maintenance for the like as I&#x27;m assuming the only thing would be the parts right because the Energy&#x27;s kind of endless so but the part and I asked a ton of questions before I got invol it bet you did I couldn&#x27;t find any gaps in any of the logic and anything related to it and I&#x27;ve also answered a lot of these questions on my live streams um there&#x27;s basically no mainten no it&#x27;s fine I&#x27;m happy to go through the main questions with you guys um but there&#x27;s basically like no maintenance Associated to it that the things that people have brought up are and so like we&#x27;re so confident that there&#x27;s so little maintenance that we&#x27;re willing to give like a warranty on it the amount of years is yet to be determined it&#x27;s probably especially in the alpha stage it&#x27;ll be like person to person like you know five 10 years something like that I don&#x27;t know sure I think we&#x27;re more concerned with people tampering with the devices and then claim then breaking it and claiming that they they did something to but people some people ask well would the magnets lose their their magnetic force magnets like especially powerful ones like neom magnets um they&#x27;re rated for at least 41 years and even after 41 years and like the worst case scenario they may only lose like 30% of their magnetic field so in 41 years I mean that&#x27;s more than most people&#x27;s like adult lifetimes um but it would have already produced so much excess energy that you know there would be no question in terms of it any product that lasts 41 years you&#x27;re happy with I mean Jesus the way things are built now um I mean let&#x27;s be real and if I&#x27;m being real as a business person you know uh which is actually where my original major is and my my my real educational background is in like I would probably have it just be like 10 year warranty or Lifetime and yes it might last for another 15 but like I would want to have some kind of real practical limitations on it and then have to people do the math based on 10 years now in a perfect scenario could last for 41 you know it might last for 25 but I want to put something that&#x27;s like more in more a shorter time frame on it for something like that um sure and if they modify it it voids the warranty right because you would imagine and so there definitely going to be like the contracts that we sign with people are going to have a thing that you know you can&#x27;t tamper with the device it avoid your warranty blah blah blah I mean that makes sense yeah and then one of the big benefits I think I&#x27;m okay to say this part is that um there&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t let&#x27;s say that I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m giving my opinion here I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 100% correct but let&#x27;s say that a lot of these magnetic motors they don&#x27;t have any belts or anything like that so one of the big benefit is there&#x27;s very little stuff that can break down so a lot of like motor type situations will have a belt even in your car and the belt can break right it&#x27;s going to wear down over time especially if you have Motors that are spinning but um or I don&#x27;t know how to do it but yeah so but the motors in this situation um you know because they don&#x27;t have any like belts or anything potentially tied to them there&#x27;s very little stuff to very little friction that&#x27;s happening there you know maybe the worst case scenario and I&#x27;m just speculating would be like maybe you have to put like a little drop of oil or something on it if it&#x27;s you know the the wheel isn&#x27;t as connected to the thing and that&#x27;s part of why Dr Greer also though talks about like devices with no moving Parts because no moving parts means like you know it&#x27;s going to have basically no maintenance but minimal moving Parts is also going to have very little maintenance so from a maintenance perspective I I think there&#x27;s very little issue with it to me the biggest issue is having it produce enough energy to run your whole house because I you know how big does the device have to be how costly is it going to get how much energy you&#x27;re using I think that a lot of people don&#x27;t realize uh or they just don&#x27;t know how much energy us I don&#x27;t know how much energy I&#x27;m using and for those would you hook it up at your house it shouldn&#x27;t that be the first test you hook one up at your house man yeah I don&#x27;t want to go too much into my living situation but let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s not super practical for me based on my living situation do it but what I will say is that um it is possible that I will have one uh handy here um in sometime in the near future and if I do then I probably will talk about a little bit I&#x27;ve kind of avoided talking about some of the stuff of the business because you probably haven&#x27;t noticed but all of the same haters that I had from MH370 have all now just shifted to hating on the free energy stuff no matter what you do they&#x27;re going to come after you it&#x27;s not never about h370 right it was always about just coming after me uh and that&#x27;s you know just goes to show what it&#x27;s about which there&#x27;s probably some in in the chat right now as well but I just call on my fans in general um but I would ask people this is my chat and they&#x27;re probably talking about me right now so like your chat is actually pretty awesome man I do have to be honest I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve checked out some of your stuff and a lot of you guys uh are are really awesome you&#x27;ve been doing by the way you&#x27;ve just been doing a great job man no thanks have you even missed a day yet on these no dud You&#x27; been consistencies amazing man like that is you are solid I and I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re doing this talking about free energy and I&#x27;m glad you had me on to talk about it because I do really do think that it&#x27;s a thing where I I just want the world to have it because I think that like wind and solar are just a big scam um and I mean that just kind of tongue and Chic I mean of course if you live off the grid don&#x27;t get me started I I I think it&#x27;s a scam too dude so don&#x27;t get me started I&#x27;m I&#x27;m with you there like go off on that if if I&#x27;m getting real wind power kills a bunch of birds solar power stuff like people don&#x27;t realize the piping they&#x27;ve got to lay the cables out outside the city it&#x27;s killing animals B I&#x27;m with you dude I could go off I&#x27;m with you I I I&#x27;m not a fan of it if you looked at the lithium mines that they have for like the solar panels it&#x27;s like green toxic sludge you like that&#x27;s got to be the worst stuff for the environment and people say oh the solar panels are technically recyclable I don&#x27;t think that they really are generally like only like one in 10 solar panels being recycled and it&#x27;s not cost benefit there&#x27;s no cost benefit to it most of the stuff the solar panels is like they get destroyed they just get thrown in the dump and now we&#x27;ve got more trash so comparatively a free energy device that can run for 10 25 41 years or more you know that is far less when it comes to damaging the envirment that&#x27;s a way where we can like have real green power and people say well where&#x27;s the energy coming from well the energy is coming from all around us but um the best way to think about it and I think um I think it was Richard Fineman first quoted this but you&#x27;ll hear people you&#x27;ll hear Dr Greer talk about it Hal POF talk about is that there&#x27;s enough energy I&#x27;ll just use this bottle here although you don&#x27;t even need a bottle this big but there&#x27;s enough energy in this entire bottle here if this was full of water to vaporize all the Earth&#x27;s oceans and when you think about it like that like E equals m s like how much energy you can produce from a very small thing now imagine we only need a little bit of energy from you know the environment to be able to power everything around us and the truth is even though we may have a lot of devices in our home that energy in relation to the size of the universe is infantes smally small so even with these types of overunity devices extracting energy from the environment it&#x27;s like taking a little teaspoon and and and pulling water out of the ocean and thinking that you&#x27;re going to drain the ocean right is just literally impossible never going to happen sure I see what you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;re not going to pull all the power that&#x27;s around here right yeah I think we would have to be like a type three civilization before we get to the point where we have to start worrying about how much energy we&#x27;re pulling from the environment to have any appreciable effect although that might be something we worry about in a thousand years or whenever we achieve that so for the power levels that we&#x27;re using you know like these types of devices I I think there&#x27;s basically no risk it&#x27;s not going to give you cancer or anything like that it&#x27;s not going to lift off the ground and take off although there does seem to be some connection between this idea of free energy and anti-gravity um uh which I think is interesting but the the amount of energy the devices that we&#x27;re talking about producing it&#x27;s too small to have any type of major effect like that how big is these machines like what are we talking like refrigerator size orome one is like refrigerator side the one that we&#x27;re selling is like um it&#x27;s motor you know a magnetic motor type situation and setup so the what we&#x27;ve been telling people is maybe like 3 by3 feet so it&#x27;s like a square like a generator size okay yeah a couple pieces to it so it&#x27;s um and you know it can be boxed up or or what have you as well it can be EMP shielded um but generally I would recommend people have stored inside out of the elements like you know in their basement or in a closet somewhere where it&#x27;s not going to be in the way it makes a little bit of noise but it&#x27;s pretty damn quiet I mean just because imagine spinning wheels um so yeah not not too large in general um but I imagine two that they could be miniaturized one business idea I have for is if we could get very small uh magnets that are very powerful potentially you could make uh some kind of portable charger that&#x27;s like just a free energy charger because I saw people that had these when I was at the cosmic Summit but it&#x27;s like solar so you can like charge this battery from like a solar panel and then you can like you know plug your USB to plug your phone into it imagine having a little device like that but that&#x27;s just extracting energy from the environment all the time so you just have a portable charger everywhere you go like that that&#x27;s always charging yeah that&#x27;s pretty cool that&#x27;s pretty cool right yeah we can get it like because even if it was only producing a little bit of excess energy as long as there&#x27;s like a little battery connected to it that it&#x27;s charging up all the time like that could be awesome so and then if you can get maybe that can be cheap enough where like that&#x27;s like a different type of product as opposed to one that&#x27;s just powering you know your house well yeah that&#x27;s a more mainstream one right to sell right it seems like um have you talked about price this publicly I don&#x27;t want to bring it up yeah and I you know I kind of got attacked for it but I you know what I&#x27;ve always tried to be transparent about it so like the price ranges wildly so it can be anywhere from like as low as potentially five to $10,000 all the way up over $100,000 um for these devices because it can be scaled up or down now if you have a device that&#x27;s on the lower end you&#x27;re really talking about something that&#x27;s just going to be able to charge like your phone and stuff like that if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s like going to power a house then you&#x27;re looking at you know the probably the midpoint or above but the way that we have it set right now is we don&#x27;t have specific products like this is the model that we&#x27;re selling at a specific price point um although that&#x27;s information that we are trying to glean from this Alpha roll out where we get a few people on board with contracts related to it but for now it&#x27;s built custom to spec and they can be scaled up or down um so and one of the main questions that we asked uh was how much power are you trying to generate from it because then we have to figure out exactly how big the device has to be okay I see what are you gonna use this for there&#x27;s a whole list of questions like it&#x27;s probably on my Twitter page uh it might not be pinned there anymore but there was a big list of questions people can go find more information right okay cool yeah and they can find the email address I mean I&#x27;ll just say it right now the company&#x27;s name is ether Tech AE t h e r te CA and the email is ether Tech llc@gmail.com I am responding to some of those emails and collecting more information but the main information is like you know tell us your contact information or you know as much as you feel comfortable telling us um you know how much energy you&#x27;re trying to produce and then what your use of the device is going to be um and there is some possibility that you know if you&#x27;re trying to learn about it we we&#x27;re still open to that idea um but you know there we&#x27;re also offering consulting services for if you want to try to do it yourself and learn how it can work so you know whatever people want to learn and do but um right now I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more of a casual thing because we understand like the suppression history around all of this and this this could get taken away at any moment you know in terms of like somebody stepping in or you know sending some kind of uh thing that says hey you we need you to stop doing this from the government or something like that so uh being very tentative at the moment and just trying to make sure you know we can actually get these devices out there to people in general so uh and then we&#x27;ll see what happens and I honestly I I approve of like anybody selling their own devices and and trying to turn this into an industry that&#x27;s what in a perfect world I&#x27;d like there to be competition industry course and and you know made the best person win who can who can figure it out uh and have it be the most efficient and cheapest because then we can you know help help fix this world up a little bit and that&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m in this is that you know truth is I only found out about this science from the MH370 videos from following the scientists and engineers and going down this uh Trail of the Science and Technology um and then I&#x27;ve been put in touch with contacts that I never would have thought I would have met my whole life after all this um and so it just seemed like The Logical way where you know there there can be some benefit from this science even if like people think that m370 videos are fake even if we never get answer from the government even if the AO never responds to me which they&#x27;re still ghosting me it&#x27;s been almost three months and they haven&#x27;t wow email me back since that last I don&#x27;t know if you saw it on on Twitter but yeah I I I remember that in fact well we spoke about it briefy the last time you were on yeah I mean briefly um yeah they hadn&#x27;t responded to you weird um yeah it is weird um you know if we can get free energy to the world that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a benefit and I think that those videos can only be real if free energy is real as well um so let me talk real quick about the some of the scientific aspects to this so that people how it&#x27;s possible um so with a system like I was describing you have one input here or let&#x27;s say input over here just to be cons system before you have this output over here and then you have a second input over here which is The Ether the Zer Point Energy input this is a non-equilibrium system so an equilibrium system would be like a conventional system let&#x27;s say wind power where your input power is the wind that&#x27;s coming in over here and then you have your output power here that would be equilibrium system equilibrium system can never be 100% efficient according to the second law of Thermodynamics because there&#x27;s always some entropy entropy is the heat that&#x27;s being given off because you know the windmill is moving it can never be 100% efficient same with solar panels same deal with that in a non-equilibrium system you can a achieve more than 100% efficiency because you have that excess input that&#x27;s coming into it therefore it&#x27;s non equilibrium anymore so you&#x27;ve got this input and you&#x27;ve got this input coming in over here this is also a what&#x27;s the input that input is the input from the0 point energy field in general I guess that&#x27;s the the the secret sauce here right that you can&#x27;t really talk about I mean that makes sense that makes sense look I get it the Casmir Force though could be it for example the however cold fusion works could be it or in the case of the magnetic motor uh what I can say is that it has to do with essentially like how you&#x27;ve aligned the magnets and if from the Thomas Bearden video of the Meg he specifically talks about taking like a not necessarily A toid but like a square shape um probably electromagnet type situation and when the magnetic field is confined within the actual structure then you have this energy that&#x27;s being radiated all around it and this is excess energy and then it&#x27;s simply a matter of being able to harness that energy capture it somehow right yeah yeah capture it and so how you capture it is potentially the secret sauce for how you can actually produce a over Unity but if you can then capture it now you have a negative entropy system which your negative entropy system is saying instead of losing energy due to heat you&#x27;re getting excess energy in from the environment which what it does is it cools down then in that situation and this is why a lot of these free energy devices they they say that not only sometimes do they lose Mass uh but they also cool down because they&#x27;re negative entry ropy systems they&#x27;re getting excess energy in instead of the excess energy going coming out in form of heat and this is how you can then achieve coefficient of performance greater than one and what people will consider to be efficiencies that are greater than uh 1.0 um and this is the part that people struggle with because they think that it violates the laws of thermodynamics but it doesn&#x27;t because what you do is you just open your system up so again a equilibrium system is going to be a closed system a non-equilibrium system is going to be an open system that is now open to the environment open to all the energy that&#x27;s around us all the time and then in order to understand that that&#x27;s possible you just go back to the beginning of this conversation and just realize that space is not empty and if space is not empty and the Casmir Force exists we know there&#x27;s excess energy that&#x27;s out there we know there&#x27;s free energy to be had we just have to figure out how to harness it and just because the Casmir Force exists doesn&#x27;t mean that the Casmir force is the only way to extract the Zero Point Energy it&#x27;s just scientific evidentiary support uh proof that it is that that energy exists out there so do do you think like um the environment in which this is operating might affect it or altitude or I don&#x27;t know right different things um generally it doesn&#x27;t matter it can prod you don&#x27;t want to have it in like freezing environments just because it&#x27;s got moving parts and things like that um that makes sense you know in general it&#x27;s not going to make any difference if it&#x27;s cold or it&#x27;s hot it&#x27;s not a matter of the temperature having an impact on it in general um just because the Zer point energy field is all around there all the time there may be some efficiency change though based on the temperature I probably have to ask about that just to be sure I&#x27;m not I don&#x27;t know off top of my head um but I don&#x27;t think like being in the mountains or altitude is going to have any impact on any it&#x27;s not a situation where gravity is having an impact plus even so the even if you were like high in mountains of Mount Everest the percentage change from the altitude is so minimal compared to the devices are operating I I don&#x27;t see there being any impact on like Earth&#x27;s mag magnetism or anything doesn&#x27;t I would be more concerned like if you take it into outer space maybe then there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s an impact but even then probably some of these devices can probably still work just fine in outer space no problem that&#x27;s how we should be um operating these spaceships right using the energy around as it travels maybe that&#x27;s probably some other stuff too that I I had to have somebody else added out something else I said about it but let&#x27;s just say imagine all the different types of vessels and the various mediums that exist and you know you could see how some type of Zero Point Energy device could be very beneficial in a lot of different scenarios for a space shutt sure satellite could be beneficial um yeah and I almost cars um yeah I could go a kitchen I could imagine a kitchen you know my chef brain going a kitchen powered by this like some sort of different technique honestly chefs would start figuring out a way to make a dish off Zero Point Energy and sell this like great Wago cut you know Zero Point Energy cooked like I I could already see the which would be cool um you know chefs are all about coming up with some crazy uh new energy for right because that&#x27;s all cooking is is energy and pro you know some sort of ingredient right mixing it in right when I I remember asking somebody uh my other podcast well what&#x27;s your favorite thing to cook they go salads I go that&#x27;s not cooking making a salad is not cooking you need to cook so anyway uh yeah dude this is fascinating man I I have to admit this is fascinating and I do want to say something real quick that that sort of endorses what you&#x27;re saying which is there are for anyone listening there are other examples of other attempts at the sort of convergence you&#x27;re talking about right where where there&#x27;s more output than input being from this wi Files episode that I found interesting because real proof of this happening right which is this guy you know with gas right and he and he made this his car go like 200 miles on two gallons and he had built this systemer I think I think that is his name car is that the what you&#x27;re talking about no no before that but that guy too right and all these people that he mentioned in in the WF falles episode AJ mentions and then what happens the Air Force gets interested and then boom it&#x27;s gone it disappears so the idea that let&#x27;s be real if this was real and this is happening and ashon you&#x27;re looking into it and make and developing a company off of it I wouldn&#x27;t imagine you would do that put all this work into it if you didn&#x27;t think there was something there so there is there is evidence in the past of these types of Technologies surfacing up bubbling up and then you know disappearing if you will through through many other you know modes right however it may be financially they ruin you your reputation um you know your life um it&#x27;s true and and this idea of free energy or Zero Point Energy it&#x27;s crazy um that that that has happened because right it&#x27;s like whoa what what all from money all because they couldn&#x27;t make money off it and the light bulb&#x27;s another great example right the light bulb was meant to last a 100 years and they were like wait a second they can make them last forever and yeah they were like that&#x27;s not going to work how are we going to sell life bulbs they do it with cameras too like cameras don&#x27;t release all their newest technology in a camera because then you would buy a camera every 20 years instead they little bits they throw at at you every year so you keep upgrading everything iPhones right every year same with iPhones yeah man they&#x27;re not giving it to everything that they can do so I find this fascinating man what what does the timeline look like for Rush actually right after this I&#x27;m going to respond to some more emails I&#x27;ve had over like 150 um and that&#x27;s after all the spam ones were removed so there&#x27;s a lot of interest in it it&#x27;s a matter of finding the right people that have the disposable income for it that are comfortable with the idea and what I would say to anybody who&#x27;s a detractor first of all like you said the thing like they have a million different ways that they can shut you down which is why I&#x27;m very realistic about I don&#x27;t know how long this might last but we&#x27;re just going to run with it as long as we can and hopefully it works out um but know there and like there&#x27;s so much so many people who are attacking me and and defaming me and what have you online related to this is super suspicious because it&#x27;s kind of like the MH370 thing too where it&#x27;s like don&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t you want this to be real because it can just change like the whole world and let&#x27;s just say hypothetically I was I was scamming people I&#x27;m not but let&#x27;s just say I was like I would I would get sued by the people that I&#x27;m selling the devices to right like so why would you even worry about it the only reason to be trying to attack me related to it is that you&#x27;re insecure in your world view because you know you think that if it turns out that I&#x27;m right then it&#x27;s going to mean that maybe I was right about MH370 maybe you&#x27;ve been wrong about and then lied to your whole lives like that&#x27;s the only reason in my mind when anyone would even be against this otherwise even the people that are against me and hate me should be like yeah go ahead and do it because it&#x27;s doomed to fail if you think it&#x27;s not possible it should be doomed to fail right but that&#x27;s not really how the people act in general so uh what I would say is just you know let it play out and and then I guess we&#x27;ll see one way or another and if I&#x27;m right then you know I&#x27;m going to help bring free energy to the world and you know then people that also maybe are like worried about me or whatever like don&#x27;t worry about me in general like I I know what consquences can happen you know because some people are like you&#x27;re gonna get disappeared hly a lot of people I get that message a lot I&#x27;m like guys I&#x27;m already been revealing like what I think is the biggest conspiracy of all time related to anti-gravity Tech and stealing a Boeing Triple 7 so you know I&#x27;m already made through that it you know yeah deep into this here so but I will say I did say I put out this video the other day where like I am pulling back a little bit on some of the science review stuff and the reason is that like I think I&#x27;m so over the Target that I am like maybe pushing it a little bit like you know I&#x27;ve seen what happened to these Boeing whistleblowers and yes I&#x27;m a brave guy but like I want to be around long enough to like help people a little bit as well so um you know so if I&#x27;m not pushing as hard as I was before and like you know just straight up calling President Obama like I was before these are parts of the reasons why it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s this is a this is a long Marathon this is not like some Sprint that we&#x27;re trying to get this stuff out there um sure so and on the last I just want to appreciate you and uh everybody who&#x27;s been supportive of it because there&#x27;s a lot of people out there that know this stuff is real and know it&#x27;s possible especially around the free energy stuff dude a lot of people talk about this I don&#x27;t get the idea of attacking you about it like it&#x27;s crazy it&#x27;s like dude like Ashton invented like what are we talking about here tons of people are talking about it reputable people yourself included there&#x27;s a history to it like what are we talking about it&#x27;s crazy yeah exactly and there&#x27;s a bunch of people too so if you&#x27;re somebody who&#x27;s like oh you have to open source it because Dr Greer said in the Lost Century you have to open source well there&#x27;s people that have done that too so why hasn&#x27;t it got out you know because it&#x27;s not as simple as that right we talked about some those big issues so you know I&#x27;m doing it the way that I think it can work maybe and I think that everybody else should do it I support everybody who&#x27;s getting free energy out there I&#x27;ll be happy if anybody can make free energy become a real thing where like the world has to accept it that that&#x27;s all I basically want I I I want everybody to try their own different path because the more different paths we try that you know maybe one of them will work out and we&#x27;ll end up getting this because a great Point truth is Pat like and I think you agree with me I want to live long enough to see Star Trek world you know where we have like 100% crazy technology like and that&#x27;s why I think you&#x27;re interested in like some of the UFO stuff too is because there&#x27;s something potentially and if so it&#x27;s going to change everything about our whole civilization and I don&#x27;t want to die and have missed out on this because I look at people like Thomas Bearden uh Bob Baker who this guy had all these high frequency gravitation wave patents even going back to people like Tesla and some of these other Brilliant Minds like they never got to see the fruits of their labors you know and I don&#x27;t want that to happen with me and for the people that are out there I know there&#x27;s Engineers that are out there right now that are like older and some of them probably want some of this stuff out like I want those people to live long enough to know that like we&#x27;re g to make it happen man we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going to make it happen it&#x27;s not going to be right away but maybe hopefully in the next 10 years 25 years we can we can make it dude you&#x27;re trying what what more do we want from people like you&#x27;re putting your effort time money into this I mean you guys have to invest money just to get this going if anyone knows it&#x27;s ever run a business before I have lots of them you you you invest a lot before you ever start making anything back and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a risk so dude anyone putting boots on the ground to do something physical investig like I just I&#x27;m so blown away by the push back on that um it it blows my mind and and like you said you know it doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t work like you you know you&#x27;re going for it like dude I&#x27;m all about it I I 100% support um you going for this I think it&#x27;s awesome um you know if there&#x27;s if this works out like hell yeah that&#x27;s like crazy and again I be I&#x27;ll be honest like this has the most promise to me than a lot of things I&#x27;ve heard this idea of this free energy the way you&#x27;ve put it right like that idea it just really has a lot of Promise like there&#x27;s you know what I mean um but I mean definitely physics already like knows like like I said before this is the crazy part is like physics agrees there&#x27;s Zero Point Energy that&#x27;s out there that there&#x27;s these Quantum fluctuations yeah they can&#x27;t explain where the virtual particles come from but they know it&#x27;s there so it&#x27;s like that&#x27;s the craziest part about me is like if you&#x27;re a dreamer if you&#x27;re somebody who just imagines what&#x27;s possible then you realize it has to be possible that we can get free energy it has to be possible it&#x27;s just a matter of like how do you correctly yeah exactly figuring it out and so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so wild about some of these people that are out there uh and honestly you know I&#x27;m just going to throw a little bit more shade at Reddit I don&#x27;t I know you&#x27;re not probably not a fan of it but this is why I love Reddit what are you talking about they love me on Reddit what are you talking about I&#x27;m the Reddit king um because like I it&#x27;s not just there&#x27;s several different subreddits I&#x27;ve seen even put predating the MH370 stuff like there&#x27;s one on em drives there&#x27;s one on uh I think there&#x27;s probably some stuff that we talk about over Unity every time you have these egotistical and they always say that&#x27;s isn&#x27;t possible because I wasn&#x27;t taught this in school blah blah blah right like every time you see these same comments over and over again yeah and I just look at go what is WR with these people like we know that the physics is possible we just need to figure out how to make it work you know and that&#x27;s where I wish people were more open-minded and I think that part of why Reddit and social media in general are just the worst is because it becomes this game of one-upping one another to be the most skeptical and to be the most uh like negative person out there like you know and it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re trying to get praised for trying to put somebody else down and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like that social media platform at least on Twitter on X for example like everybody has their own voice so people can gravitate towards people that they appreciate so what I would say for the people that are out there is should open up your mind a little bit and let&#x27;s try to make social media a little bit better because I think that it really holds back a lot of these scientific progress and advancements when we think inside this box of this is only what&#x27;s possible uh nothing else beyond what I know and what I was taught it can be can be real I mean I can&#x27;t argue that man I mean that that&#x27;s like science 101 right and and you know what speaking of Terrence Howard Eric Weinstein they they did that interview on Joe Rogan did you see that I mean hours first half of it yesterday but yeah like four hours so I only got through like the first half I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m even get through the second half tonight honestly the last 20 minutes or the best part oh is it damn see the first like 45 minutes is like I I don&#x27;t like a lot of the numerology math like one time one equals two stuff I&#x27;m not big on that and they talked about it for like a while but they did have some pretty good stuff where um and honestly ER Weinstein had some good points as well two of the the points yeah the Aaron Hoff bom effect stuff was really good because so he points out that like even if in the absence of electromagnetic field you&#x27;ll still see light Bend so the question is like why is it still bending when there&#x27;s no electromagnetic fields manipulating it there&#x27;s something going on and this is where he says there like must be curvature at these like small micro you know Quantum scales that are going on sure the other thing and this is just a message to the people that are out there um he says like don&#x27;t hit on on 19 he tells uh Terence Howard that part I don&#x27;t know if you remember that where the reason why that&#x27;s a big one is that it&#x27;s like when you have 19 your hand is good enough and and what this means is that like a lot of people out there especially in the UFO conspiracy worlds they&#x27;re trying to find the answer to everything that unifies everything together like Consciousness anti-gravity free energy uh you know the old sacred teachings and lost civilizations they want everything to be connected together which you know to some degree maybe it is but when you do that the reason why tells Terence Howard is that you open yourself up to fall into a landmine where now you&#x27;re going to find something where they&#x27;ll be able to discredit you really easily and maybe I deserve some criticism because I&#x27;m you know talking about free energy now after talking about teleportation and anti-gravity uh but this is why like I don&#x27;t go too far into this the sacred geometry stuff and like I I try to stay in my Lanes as much as I can sure and that&#x27;s what I would tell people that are out there too is that not every conspiracy is necessarily connected together although for UFOs to exist there&#x27;s got to be a pretty major one going on um yeah I thought uh Weinstein has points I want to listen to about scaler physics and the second half later tonight you know for me um look I&#x27;ll be honest a lot of it was over my head okay I didn&#x27;t pretend to know a lot of the things they were talking about but what I found Most Fascinating and what I took away from it was really the end right when when for me anyway when Brent Weinstein they take a bathroom break that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s how you know where it starts the clip what I&#x27;m talking about anyway he comes back and they basically start talking about look academics because this goes back to my science 101 thing right the point you made before that like we it&#x27;s like academics and science has forgotten to sort of be open to ideas and discussing them and going over them and right having this sort of and that&#x27;s what he appreciated about Terrence and what he was trying to do and um you know he just made this great speech about just like we need to be having these discussions going over this stuff but being able to  too but being able to look at this go that&#x27;s interesting and this and that but the idea of just let&#x27;s not shut all this down and just is that peer reviewed is this that is this this is that you know like get crazy with it or get personal and you know hey let&#x27;s let&#x27;s be able to talk about this and people can learn and sometimes you learn from by making let&#x27;s be real you learn the most by making mistakes right in life um right Anthony Bain I always bring everything back to food Anthony had qu is he&#x27;s oh God hero of mine dude like you in order to get to the best meal you&#x27;ve got to go through a few bad ones it&#x27;s that simple right because you&#x27;ve got to be open to eating too right it&#x27;s like go try this place go try this meal try this ingredient try this thing to get to something you may never know is going to be good or you know take you to that um Umami we call it flavor where it&#x27;s just like it brings everything together that&#x27;s what Umami means it&#x27;s just like perfect like like just the perfectness and I feel that way about a lot of this stuff even though I don&#x27;t understand it um the idea that we can&#x27;t discuss it or people can&#x27;t try to bring it to fruition hello like I that&#x27;s 101 like of course we should be there and then go from there but the idea that we would just shut that down at the beginning I I just it makes zero sense to me so yeah like you know was a great quote by the way anthonyy bdan also one of my heroes uh you know rest in peace that guy um yeah but one of somebody else that I want to quote is kind of a similar vein I posted this video yesterday from uh Carl Sean and his last interview he did in like 1996 so we&#x27;ve arranged a society based on science and technology in which no one understands anything about science and technology and I I think that&#x27;s such a great quote right and not to put you down because you just mentioned like I don&#x27;t understand stuff but you&#x27;re open it it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s true like you know even this iPhone does I don&#x27;t understand how my mouse works bro yeah do my mic the cable the the video were on the goddamn light behind me like you&#x27;re right I&#x27;m surrounded by things I have like how are we even talking right now how are we even doing totally dude you&#x27;re right that is a great quote I&#x27;m proba that&#x27;s the great point though too is that like this is why it goes back to what I mentioned before this idea that we should be more open-minded to your point as well because like we don&#x27;t even understand how the devices we&#x27;re working right now how we&#x27;re using right now work so you know maybe there is more that&#x27;s going on and this is another thing that I&#x27;ve said even the MH370 stuff is like unless you think that we are at the Pinnacle of Science and Technology and advancement right now then we still have more to learn and more to go and that means that some of what we thought is true before must be wrong to some degree doesn&#x27;t mean we have to throw everything out sure but maybe there&#x27;s some fun FAL assumptions that we made which aren&#x27;t true anymore and if that&#x27;s true then we should be people who are dreamers people that are looking for what&#x27;s the future going to look like in a hundred or a thousand years and what kind of Technology can we really produce so dude I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more bro it&#x27;s like get out of the cave let&#x27;s go see what&#x27;s over the hill It&#x27;s Kind it&#x27;s it&#x27;s odd that we constantly have to like be reminded of that and remind people of that especially in this field you know that I cover on B all the time it&#x27;s it&#x27;s and maybe I was guilty of it even myself at the beginning a little bit not being as open-minded I I&#x27;ll admit that um but yes we we have to start there first to listening and having the conversation and going there I mean I just shutting that down and again for me anyone willing to do like actual things boots on the ground right like actually do something dude I totally support it I I saw you know that brings me to a great point and maybe I hope I didn&#x27;t get this wrong but were you hanging out with like Jeremy riss alien scientists and those guys or no yeah so you probably saw the clip that I I reposted related to that um we did have a private uh conversation that that we didn&#x27;t record um between uh there was a PhD physicist and uh some of the engineers that that Jeremy hangs out with um and some of the people that I that I&#x27;m working with on uh the uh the overunity device stuff as well and we talked through science with them and some Concepts and what I can say is that they you know some of Jeremy was concerned that maybe I was getting scammed as well because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a very skeptical minded guy uh in general especially when it comes to the science and a lot of his concerns were alleviated after he uh spoke with us so I I think that was a pretty good endorsement in general uh I&#x27;m a big fan of the AP guys yeah I&#x27;m a fan of those guys because they&#x27;re some of the only people who are actually trying to understand the science and the technology that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying they&#x27;re actually doing stuff like yeah I agree and you know maybe it&#x27;s not all going to work or what have you but I happen to think that a lot of it&#x27;s going to end up working but um that&#x27;s why I appreciate those guys a lot and uh that&#x27;s why you know that was actually back in the MH370 stuff that was probably the interview I was most worried about because I knew those guys were super smart and I was like if anyone&#x27;s gonna be able to prove this science isn&#x27;t real it&#x27;s gonna be them but they came out of it and they&#x27;re like Jeremy&#x27;s biggest thing was like well I think it might be cloaking and not teleportation but other than that like I can&#x27;t debunk any of the the science that you see in the videos so I think that&#x27;s a pretty good endorsement I also would recommend that people check out like some of the APAC conversations especially Tim Ventura&#x27;s work like if people aren&#x27;t familiar with Tim that guy&#x27;s great interviewer by the way he&#x27;s great his interviews are awesome I would I 1,000 benefit there is like he he talks to the engineers like that&#x27;s why I think people in I guess it&#x27;s called euphology I call it ufology but if people talk to more engineers and no disrespect to experiencers but everybody has experiences and the thing about experiences you can&#x27;t like prove them scientifically although they are absolutely meaningful don&#x27;t get me wrong but if you talk to the engineers that are working for the pmc&#x27;s and we&#x27;re going to drop that acronym again the private military contract those are the people that know like not only do they like know the science but they have seen the crazy orbs and the other you know free energy devices and things like that to me those are the people that people should be talking to in general and this is why I respect Dr Greer even though a lot of people don&#x27;t like his C5 stuff and what have you is that he&#x27;s talked to a lot of those Engineers like I just posted all the DIA defense intelligence agency papers and I found all the names of the authors they&#x27;re all just available online and when I&#x27;m looking through it I&#x27;m seeing Hal POF Eric uh Eric uh Davis as like four of the papers he&#x27;s got the one about extracting energy from the vacuum and he&#x27;s got the one about wormholes I&#x27;m like okay saw a video on him 10 years ago it was I should send you this video of Eric Davis 14 years old it has 900 views it&#x27;s crazy I&#x27;m gonna send that to you I don&#x27;t think you I bet you&#x27;ve never seen this video probably not I haven&#x27;t looked into enough of his stuff but I&#x27;m think he&#x27;s probably it wild bro in fact when I was watching I was thinking of you I was I was like love this I I watched this clip that Dr Greer had interviewed Paul SI I had no idea who this guy was and he&#x27;s saying well he spent 30 years in the Air Force or 30 years in private military contractors uh 15 years I think in the Air Force with like eight at Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is like the place where they think they test all the UFOs and stuff and he spent like half his time in private military contractors and black projects he&#x27;s just sitting here and this was like late 2000s or early 2000s and he&#x27;s talking about yeah we had craft that could go like 14,000 miles an hour I&#x27;m like what how fast like and he&#x27;s just casually talking about casually talking about teleportation being possible and then turns out he wrote one of those Dia papers I&#x27;m like I see his name I&#x27;m go oh now I recognize his name I&#x27;m like oh  I mean people need to talk to the engineers man like these guys know stuff and the world just like they get discredited Eric Davis gets discredited how Poff gets discredited yeah you know I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that people try to discredit these guys because I think that they just literally know bunch of bunch of crazy stuff no you&#x27;re right man I I I agree with all that um yeah that that dude that is fascinating yeah I&#x27;m I I dude wow okay wow I&#x27;ve got a lot of homework to do now Ashton right a lot to look into I learned a lot to be honest with you as someone who you know comes at it very simply and just with a dumb Chef mind I try to understand some of this um but breaking it down just very simply for me and I think a lot of the audience because I&#x27;m sure a lot of the audience is going to you know they they&#x27;re pseudo scientist and and whatever great um but I don&#x27;t pretend to know things I don&#x27;t so yeah and I&#x27;ll check out the chat when we when this plays and I try to answer some questions I would say the main thing just to recap the main points is that space is not empty there is zero point energy out there there&#x27;s got to be a way to harness it when it comes to the first and second laws of thermodynamics we don&#x27;t really have to completely rewrite them although I think at some point we will uh we just have to open our system up you open your system up and then you realize that you&#x27;re extracting this energy from the environment this allows us to get around the second law of Thermodynamics make our system non-equilibrium we add that extra input and then from the first law thermodynamics which would say energy can&#x27;t be created or destroyed you realize we&#x27;re not creating it we&#x27;re borrowing it we&#x27;re we&#x27;re taking our little teaspoon and we&#x27;re taking little teaspoons of energy out of the ocean right and so we&#x27;re borrowing that energy and it&#x27;s not going to have any appreciable impact on the overall and if you think of it like that then all of a sudden overunity becomes way more feasible 100% like absolutely I mean I&#x27;m convinced honestly I&#x27;m just like I think it again I think it&#x27;s the most promising sort of idea that I&#x27;ve heard out here um in The Ether if you will well I want to show you one day I think that&#x27;ll be fun so hell yeah my reaction will be nuts U for sure um I my mind will be blown there&#x27;s no question um yeah I find this fascinating and it it has real world applications it could help real people help real families help real people that&#x27;s why not look into that oh look how much other we research and develop all over the place for all kinds of things like give me a break we we shouldn&#x27;t look into this get out of here 100% AG you know what I mean so yeah dude no props to you respect to you again I&#x27;ll put links in the description to the three documentaries we mentioned of course your you know your Twitter your YouTube um what other link should I put in if there&#x27;s something else send it to me and I&#x27;ll add it to the you know that&#x27;s great I think everybody should if you watch people watch those documentaries I think that&#x27;d be great I did a few live streams that people can find where I go over some of that stuff I actually watched I think a couple of those documentaries on my live streams uh where people want to learn more they can check that out for sure um and then just as a quick plug I am planning on getting some uh MH370 Clips made from some of my old stuff maybe I&#x27;ll actually have them do some clips from our interview that we did as well uh because I mean I&#x27;m not completely moving away from that but like you know kind of dried up all the investigative research out there so potentially can to have some of those CLI coming out where some of them will talk about the science some of them will talk about the conspiracy angle investigation so be on the lookout for those over the next uh few months as well guys finance a oh dude always you have an open invitation on the show dude you know once a guest always a guest I really appreciate talking to you I would say this dude you should make a documentary I some producer dude I would watch the hell out of that like if you put together a document if anyone should you would you got a lot there to make something and tell your side of the story and what you I think enough time is p you&#x27;ve done enough right to have something there and maybe end it on the free energy thing and what you&#x27;re doing and like that could be cool that&#x27;s the ending not to give ideas but yeah I mean this is what I&#x27;m the idea man okay I&#x27;m the idea man ashon doesn&#x27;t mean I can execute it but I got ideas so look yes this was awesome thank you again for coming on um and just much appreciated man thanks a lot Pat love you man I own world of kids screaming in the crad profanities I see the Earth through ice covered in in Cross the ones who had my cries and watch</p>
