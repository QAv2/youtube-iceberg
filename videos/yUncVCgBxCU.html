            <p>Mercury is a ferof fluid it&#x27;s actually a liquid metal uh so we discovered that by putting this liquid metal into a Taurus which is a steel tus with a reverse magnetic field inside of it to keep the actual uh fluid from the the ferof fluid from touching the inside and then you actually can bring it up to a rotation to a to an RPM of about 50,000 once you do that and then pressurize that Taurus to about 250,000 pressures you then get this amazing anti-gravity bubble and what you don&#x27;t get complete anti-gravity but you do get to reduce the weight of an object with anything within the range of that Tor field will be reduced by up to 70% the mass uh so these are some of the theories that we&#x27;re exper experimenting with and we&#x27;re very excited about it because it really looks like we&#x27;ll be able to provide something that could potentially provide an anti-gravity or or reduce the mass of an object</p>
