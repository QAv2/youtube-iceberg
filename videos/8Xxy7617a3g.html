            <p>greetings to the presentation on the reciprocal system of theory by Dy B lson the name of the presentation is a universe of motion of which now we shall be checking out the subdivision threedimensional motion I&#x27;m Gopi Krishna and I&#x27;ll be guiding you through this presentation so let&#x27;s begin first of all let&#x27;s have a look at the origin of this idea from the first postulate we have the phrase existing in three dimensions what dimensions are we talking about and what is meant by the dimension of a motion and how is it different from our conventional view of the physical Universe these are the things which we&#x27;ll be checking out so let&#x27;s look at the first the definition the definition of dimension in Latin is dimensio or to measure the number of independent variables required to specify a quantity completely is called a dimension hence these Dimensions or the variables used to represent them are completely independent of each other and the dimensions of motion which we speak about in this presentation means the three ratios or the three speeds independent speeds which determine a motion completely now let&#x27;s use the definition our usual idea of Dimensions is mostly regarding the nature of space we apply the definition to get the three independent and orthogonal values for example take the first row to your left the second to your right and come to the third floor gives all the three dimensions width bread and height to that we usually add a four dimension be there at 11:00 a.m. Shar which is time now now let&#x27;s see how it relates to our universe our conventional 3D reference systems let us have a look at what we usually measure in our day-to-day life this is called the conventional reference system or the coordinate spatial reference system this is because we measure space as coordinate space that is having three independent Dimensions x y and Zed whereas we use clock time or a scalar progression of time which is measured on a clock for our reference in case of time the conventional system has the following properties space can be represented by a vector time can be represented by a scalar and it is measured separately the ratio of space to time is hence a speed with a direction that is a velocity so motion is measured as a vector in our conventional reference system however in the reciprocal system the three dimensions are of scalar speeds so we have speed 1 Speed 2 Speed 3 being the three independent speeds which totally determine the motion so how do we go about representing this now what now we determine how much we can measure and how note that our reference frame measures only vectorial motion and due to the nature of scalar motion three scalar speeds cannot be presented as independent motions so what can be measured let&#x27;s look at this the three Scala speeds are shown by the orange arrows and that is the scalar range this we represent using coordinate space and clock time which is our conventional reference system this measurement comes in the coordinate range representation of motion the scalar range is the full range of motions which occur in the universe we have not yet coupled our reference system to measure them this is what is possible according to our Theory and the coordinate range is what we ultimately measure the conventional reference system can only represent any one Scala speed completely and the other two speeds what happens to them the other two scalar Dimensions can have no direct representation on this conventional reference system but they do have an indirect representation and what does that mean it means they can modify the magnitude of motion in the conventional reference system in other words they cannot be represented as we normally represent motion but they can be represented only in a change of magnitude of what we already measure so the story so far is we have three dimensions of coordinate space we have three dimensions of scalar speed in the reciprocal system this gives us to a question why not use three dimensions of coordinate time and Scala space or the question is can time be 3D because if this is possible where space has three dimensions 4 M 5 m and 6 M and time can be represented by one Scala 8 seconds then so is this where time is represented in three independ dependent Dimension 4 seconds 5 Seconds 6 second and space gives the scalar 8 m measurement so the answer to the question is oh yes Scala or clock space space and time are two aspects of motion as we have seen this destination doeses not preclude either one of them from having properties similar to the other hence logically we can have coordinate time and scalar space scalar or clock space scalar space is also a uniform scalar progression that is it has no vectorial aspects no direction and only a magnitude it can hence be measured in a way similar to clock time because we measure clock time as only a scalar progression this is what gives the name to the this kind of space as clock space the reference systems the 3D spatial reference system is what we normally use which consists of clock time and coordinate space and we now have another option of using 3D temporal reference system which has coordinate time coupled with clock space coordinate space can be represented as follows X Y and Z and clock time has just a Scala magnitude in other words motion can be represented by SX s y s z and T and similarly in coordinate time we can represent motion as s TX t y and TZ the subscripts x y and Zed show the three independent Dimensions so this is the complete representation of the Scala motion there are the three Scala speeds as usual and only one of them can be represented and it can be represented in either of the two ways one is coordinate space and clock time and the other is coordinate time and clock space so we now have the take-home ideas there are three scalar speeds representation of only one speed is possible and we have two kinds of reference systems one coordinate space and clock time and the other one coordinate time and clock space we can use either one of these reference systems or both of them thank you to identify the units of motion we have the next presentation quantization</p>
