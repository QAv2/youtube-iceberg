            <p>all right hello everyone I hope everybody&#x27;s doing well out there uh I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos on obscure esoteric matters and um uh fairly recently we got done with the unit on the tree of life or at least done for now uh we&#x27;re gonna revisit that and we&#x27;re gonna be revisiting it throughout because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of fundamental basis of uh the other stuff that we&#x27;re going to study here so now we&#x27;re into the reciprocal system of theory which is a Theory of Everything a system of theory of everything that uh was originated by Dewey B Larson back in the middle part of the 20th century and uh has been carried forward by uh Dr Bruce Pratt Dr kvk nehru uh and also Dr Gopi Krishna and others um in the 21st century today we&#x27;re going to resume the reading of Dewey Larson&#x27;s speech that he gave in 1986 in front of the uh society that was formed to um it kind of propagate the reciprocal system of theory which was the Isis uh Institute for the Society of a unified science and uh so uh you might not be able to understand any of this unless you go back to the beginning this is like the fifth uh fifth installment or maybe even the sixth installment of the reading of this so you would need to go back to um the first one and re really you should probably go back to the first video on the reciprocal system I believe this is number 13. okay uh we&#x27;re gonna start with number 47 with uh uh I guess uh 0.47 or entry 47 uh um where scalar Motion in space is three-dimensional the speed in one of the dimensions may be greater than Unity but as indicated in number 29 the effective magnitude of a combination of motions is determined by the net total of the scalar speeds and because there are two low speed dimensions the net speed is less than Unity in this case then the motion in the high speed Dimension acts as a motion in equivalent space and modifies the magnitude of the change of position in space rather than causing a change of position in time okay um just uh one of the key one of the key uh terms here is the equivalent space uh we met this I think yesterday also but the equivalent space basically peret explains equivalent space you know okay we go back to the beginning of Larson you know the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are the same but they are reciprocals of each other but they have the same characteristics um but from our vantage point in this universe we are uh in the material sector there&#x27;s another sector called The Cosmic sector that may be where our soul is um but uh we as physical beings are in the um material sector and from our and so are our uh instruments that we use to measure things uh we are in the material sector and from the material sector we are incapable of seeing time we can&#x27;t see time we only can see space so when something occurs in time we do not see it in time we as we see it in equivalent space uh and since space and time are reciprocals we basically see the opposite thing happen in space now uh one idea of that is like the white dwarf star so in Larson&#x27;s um you know figuring of it the white dwarf star is a star that uh explodes beyond the speed of light now remember the speed of light is like the bout it&#x27;s in like for Einstein the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe for Larson the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe or really even the neutral point between two universes the reciprocal and the cosmic universe or the material in the cosmic universe so when a uh Stellar explosion a Nova where a stellar explosion uh blows out in space but once that explosion gets Beyond Unity beyond the speed of light then that explosion is an explosion in time instead of space so it blows up in time but we don&#x27;t see time so what we see is what we see in equivalent space so instead of seeing uh the explosion in time what we see is actually an implosion in Space the things move all further together in space so that&#x27;s what a white dwarf star is it&#x27;s a compact super Dense Star as a result of an explosion in space in time instead of space because it is beyond the speed of light okay that I just wanted to kind of clarify that with uh hopefully clarify that okay number 48. we identify the material atoms with scalar rotation in equivalent space as the at atoms of the electronegative elements okay so the electronegative elements I believe those are the ones that are on the um on the right side of the periodic table um yeah okay then number 49 we also encounter Motion in equivalent space within the units of space here no modification of the normal progression of space can take place because of the discrete unit postulate but motion can take place in time inasmuch as this motion within the spatial unit does not alter the position of time of the unit as a whole changes within the unit that result from the motion are observed in equivalent space rather than in actual time number 50 the existence of a spatial unit where motion has properties quite different from those prevailing in the region outside the unit explains the discontinuity in physical properties at very short distances that has led to the development of quantum theory okay the existence of a spatial unit where motion has properties quite different from those in the prevailing region outside the unit so he&#x27;s making a delineation here between motion outside of a unit of space and that inside the unit of space now you have to go back to Larson&#x27;s discrete unit postulate everything or basically the quantum everything is uh based on discrete units there&#x27;s no uh you know 0.6 or 0.3 or something like that it&#x27;s all integers and you have to have at least one integer at least one to have something and so there is a realm uh just like the speed of light is a unit speed that is one the speed of light is one uh in this um and if you&#x27;re going faster than the speed of light you know it could be two or three you know um and it can be adjusted but then you know it could be half or a third uh you use unit fractions uh but also with it in addition to that unit of speed you also have a unit of time and you have a unit of space okay so this unit it turns out according to his calculations that this unit of space is um I think it&#x27;s approximately equal to 4.56 times 10 to the minus 8 um centimeters so that&#x27;s the unit of space and anything that&#x27;s inside of that unit of space uh that&#x27;s that goes beyond this boundary and um that he calls here the existence of a spatial unit where motion has properties quite different from those prevailing in the region outside the unit okay so if you&#x27;re outside that unit you&#x27;re in the material sector but you&#x27;re also in what he calls the time space region um but it might actually be more reasonable to call it the space-time region but he calls it the time space region um but if you&#x27;re within that unit uh any type of motion within one unit of space uh everything within one unit of space is in time okay so he has this thing that&#x27;s called the time region so the time region is the region inside one unit of space now he has the same thing on the other side for the what he calls the space region the space region is everything that is inside of one unit of time and his unit of time is extremely small it&#x27;s like um I think it&#x27;s like 6.58 times 10 to the minus 16 16 seconds um you know so uh in every every uh second there are um oh yeah that that&#x27;s how it that&#x27;s how it works it&#x27;s 1.52 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds so in every um every second there are um six thousand trillion um units of time but anything inside that unit uh is is in space so there&#x27;s a so he he&#x27;s constructing there&#x27;s really four regions that and they&#x27;re divided by the speed of light unit speed and on one side you have the material sector and on the other side you have the cosmic sector but within the material sector there is like the normal region which he calls the time space region but then there is also um the time region so the time region is within unit space and on the other side the cosmic sector he has the space-time region which is the main region but then uh inside of one unit of time is the space region so uh there are four different sectors there you can see this in the uh I I don&#x27;t know how to pronounce it but the tajitu or the um yin yang symbol you know where you have the uh on you know you have the circle and on one side it&#x27;s white and then what the other side is black but within the within the black side there&#x27;s a little white circle and within the white side there&#x27;s a little black circle that&#x27;s the same uh kind of structure that he&#x27;s talking about here um so he says the existence of a spatial unit where motion has properties quite different from those prevailing in the region outside the unit explains the discontinuity in physical properties at very short distances that has led to uh quantum theory the development of quantum theory so they had to come up with quantum theory to explain uh you know what the fact that there is a difference between these two different uh regions between the time space region and the time region in particular okay number 51 the progression of the natural reference system relative to the spatial system of reference is always outward but as indicated in paragraph 10 the natural datum level or physical zero is that Unity rather than at the mathematical zero within a unit of space outward from Unity is towards zero it follows that the progression within the unit as seen in the spatial reference system is inward okay number 52 from paragraph 31 the gravitational motion is inward this direction 2 is inward relative to the Natural datum Unity within a unit of space it is therefore outward in the spatial reference system so this is another key point in the time space region gravitation is inward everything moves toward each other but within the time region in that small little region there uh where um everything is in time um gravitational gravitational gravitation is inward in time and so therefore it is outward in space so everything so gravitation basically moves everything toward that boundary toward that unit boundary uh if it&#x27;s outside in the in the time space region it moves things closer together toward that boundary but if it&#x27;s inside the time region it actually moves things farther apart toward that boundary and that creates a lot of uh effects that you may not 4C okay um number 53 no stable equilibrium uh between the atoms or Aggregates of matter is possible at separations greater than one unit of space the Inward and outward motions are equal at the gravitational limit but this equilibrium is unstable as the change in separation due to any unbalance between the opposing motions increases the unbalance within a unit of space where the directions of the basic motions as seen in the spatial reference system are reversed the effect of a change in separation between atoms due to an unbalance of the opposing motions reduces the unbalance and eventually results in the establishment of a stable equilibrium okay um now okay we&#x27;re just gonna do number 54 here the positional equilibrium in equivalent space that is established within a unit of space accounts for the existence of the crystalline state of matter um we could have just I think he could have just called it the solid state of matter Bruce perrette&#x27;s footnote is called the crystal is continuous in the time of the reference system but discontinuous in the space of the reference system I would say more that uh you know the phenomenon that he&#x27;s talking about is called solid cohesion uh within a unit of space there&#x27;s an equilibrium that develops um and uh that leads to uh I guess it is called solid cohesion where um within a unit of space um things get there&#x27;s an equilibrium because um that everything is moving toward that boundary that unit of space boundary and so that leads for him to solid cohesion and also the inter-atomic distance and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a kind of a set distance between uh atoms of the same kind that are structured in a you know a lattice or that are aggregated together um they they they naturally go to a certain distance apart from each other and this is based on um being in the time region and um you know the basically you you have like a tug of war between gravitation and the progression in the outside region in the time space region uh the progression is moving everything apart from each other and gravitation is moving everything toward each other at a certain point um you get so far away that the gravitation is attenuated and so things will move away from each other within that distance uh gravitation overpowers the progression and things move toward each other but within the unit of time it&#x27;s different because grab the progression is actually moving everything toward each other toward this kind of zero point and um gravitation is moving everything toward the one so gravitation is always moving toward one and the progression is either moving towards zero or toward Infinity okay now we just um you may be totally lost you probably want to go back to the start but this is all kind of to show how difficult this stuff is and how huge of a task this was for Larson to not only formulate this but to put it into language and he didn&#x27;t always do it right you know so that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s an important thing okay we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow have a great day</p>
