            <p>most people know the phrase follow the money but following the money is impossible when it comes to keeping track of us tax M dollars flowing through the Pentagon we do know that more than half of the military budget goes to private defense contractors at times the number of private contractors has even outnumbered that of enlisted troops this invisible Army operates with little oversight and sometimes carrying out missions that government agencies are barred by law from carrying out themselves if military spending isn&#x27;t going to defense contractors it&#x27;s being wasted in staggering ways like ordinary products charged at outrageous prices or military construction projects costing billions that were never finished never used sometimes not even wanted and this was especially relevant concerning us efforts in Afghanistan and let&#x27;s not forget about the F-35 jet program in which US taxpayers will pay 1.7 trillion over the course of its operation despite persistent failures since the program&#x27;s launch in 2001 even after all this time half of these Jets aren&#x27;t even combat ready and now we&#x27;ve borrowed so much money to finance Wars that interest payments on these debts now exceed the entire cost of our national defense spending which amounts to trillions of dollars but when the Pentagon continues to fail every single audit attempt seemingly unphased in its inability to account for billions of dollars one must wonder where is all of our taxpayer money really going enter the black budget world the US Military and intelligence agencies have billions of dollars worth of secret projects they don&#x27;t want you to know about these billions have funded a secret world of advanced science technology weapons and various covert activities which have always been shielded from congressional oversight and public scrutiny back in the 90s members of the House armed services committee once said that 70% of the black budget could be Declassified at no risk to National Security our taxpayer dollars are funding these black budget programs and we have a right to know what we&#x27;re paying for so why the secrecy what are these covert elements really hiding this is why we&#x27;re interviewing Private Pilot and Military Aerospace historian Michael shot whose investigated top secret Advanced Technologies buried deep within the military intelligence complex for over 25 years he alleges to have firsthand experience with classified government black budget programs with access to former US Air Force pilots retired Naval personnel and former aerospace engineers with top secret Clarence he&#x27;s one of the leading Authority voices in investigating government programs involving the recover Y and study of offworld Technology also known as UAP UFO crash retrieval programs he&#x27;s author of dark files which brings to life historically significant incredible UFO cases obtained from University archives research centers and private collections using carefully reconstructed illustrations of the events most of these defense contractors working Within These black budget programs are the same ones profiting from the current Wars ravaging the world and if these defense contractors possess hidden UFO UAP knowledge if they have access to Advanced technological and scientific breakthroughs that could radically transform Society there are legitimate concerns that these breakthroughs will be exploited and not used for humanitarian purposes the implications are too profound to ignore let&#x27;s investigate this matter further with Michael sh hello everyone I&#x27;m Amber Yang director for wanton know. info and peers and our news editor Mark Bailey is here in space Hi everyone and we&#x27;re so glad to be with you Michael to listen learn and help spread the important work you&#x27;re doing to educate people about what&#x27;s going on deep inside the military-industrial complex from educating about the corruption and abuse that&#x27;s happening but also uncovering some of the most Advanced Technologies and its extraterrestrial influences we&#x27;re all here because we want to know and we want to know what&#x27;s going on deep within our system programs that we pay for and when the Pentagon says that there&#x27;s been no evidence that the US has collected any off-world technology government insiders and Witnesses with high credibility say otherwise so what&#x27;s being kept hidden from us and why uh very good question well there is an entire black landscape that has been kept from the public I&#x27;m going to give you a couple examples here obviously we have a black budget we have classified aircraft we have black bases essentially we&#x27;re dealing with a multi-billion dollar classified black world heer there&#x27;s multiple programs going on there are Legacy programs that have never been Declassified in the Reagan Administration at least 12 man classified programs have not been Declassified we&#x27;ve got over 119 crash retrieval cases to my knowledge um basically all of those have not been dislodged so there&#x27;s this document that you can request from the Library of Congress that they put out every year and in this document they list the programs but a lot of these programs they have no mention of the money spent on it those are the black programs and those are the ones I like to focus in on wow well thank you for doing that work because even just trying to find any media article after 2015 about black budget programs is almost almost non-existent it&#x27;s hard to find information about this I&#x27;m curious about what Drew you to this field of work of studying black budget programs and extraterrestrial UFO phenomena what Drew you to this work nice question well I&#x27;ve always had an interest in aviation my father used to bring me to an air museum near Chicago it was called the victory air M Museum and they had these old war Birds parked out in the field and there was Weeds growing through the wheel wells and the paint was chipped and the paint was faded and the windshields were cracked and it just had this ghostly aura about them all these Old World War II Birds just sitting out there in the field so from that point um my father used to take me to the ashkash air show which is the largest air show in the world uh went there for 27 years straight and then just started piecing these little puzzles together interviewing Engineers interviewing test Pilots interviewing people who worked on classified programs at Air Force plant 42 that led to the crash retrievals and personally I feel that that is going to be the vehicle for disclosure because the crash retrievals have the bodies the debris and the craft all wrapped up into one thing and so that&#x27;s what this field needs to move forward interesting so if you could declassify one technology developed under these black budget programs uh what would it be and why on January 28th 1986 the Challenger exploded and the United States Air Force lost what they called their assured access to space now while all this is going on concurrently they had multiple Titan 2 booster failur at the same time so really the United States Air Force they were out of business they had no way for space access so they put out a desperate call to the defense contractors all the major defense contractors and they said we need for you to design for us a TW staged orbit space plane that can be anywhere in the world in less than two hours and they did it they did it it&#x27;s still under wraps to this day it&#x27;s called the Black Star program it&#x27;s this large mother ship that has a cavity on the bottom of it for the release of a parasitic aircraft and and this thing can literally be anywhere in the world in less than two hours it has a synthetic aperture radar on it it can release small payloads it&#x27;s a man program because if there&#x27;s something going on in the mid East or there&#x27;s something going on in Russia they need to be able to get there immediately and the problem we&#x27;re running into is that satellites satellites have these predictable orbits and so let&#x27;s just call it a nation of concern can track when this satellite flies over but if you have a classified aircraft you can get a pilot into that thing you can take off you can detach from the mother ship and then you just pour the coals to this thing and you can be there on site unannounced on a surprise visit and you can photograph and send in real time back to the intelligence agency so CIA nro NSA they can all get the information in real time I&#x27;ve done extensive research I&#x27;ve inter interviewed people who have seen this in person there are new newspaper articles where people saw this thing flying overhead and they have a drawing of it there I was able to commission my friends to do a a full color 3D rendering of this and then I took everything I learned from Aviation week space technology I took everything I learned from the witnesses that I interviewed who actually saw this I spent weeks putting together a detailed three viiew drawing and I sent that information all the way 9,000 miles to the Philippines and had them build me a really nice big scale model of this thing cool wow that would be the Black Star program would be one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex that we all paid for everybody&#x27;s paid for it and they&#x27;re not going to show it to anybody they keep quiet about it out of all the Advanced Technologies that we know about here on Earth how many of those do you think were influenced by these ET Tech that we reverse engineered or found in the crash retrieval programs I believe it&#x27;s a two-pronged answer the first prong is the good oldfashioned American Ingenuity you can track the legacy of the stealth technology for instance uh going from the have blue to the f17 um then you&#x27;ve got the F22 you&#x27;ve got the F35 you can track this Legacy on how that took place it was a Russian scientist that came up with the mathematical equations that predict radar cross signature return it was a Russian scientist and that was the beginning of the have blue program that led to the F-117 so you can see there&#x27;s this historical lineage that this follows however getting to the crash retrievals we&#x27;ve been spending billions of dollars in tax budget you know funding and from the 119 crash retrieval cases that we have these Legacy military firsthand Witnesses are telling us that there absolutely is a UFO crash retrieval program ongoing so there&#x27;s a two-prong front Christopher melan former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence W always feels like a a mouthful to say that melon released a screenshot from a a conversation back in 2020 with allegedly a senior US government official on Signal about a recovered us UFO that landed in Kingman Arizona in the 50s and that this government official he said in the signal conversation that he knows who recovers the crashed or recovered UFOs which authorities are involved and also um allegedly knew the Air Force Gatekeepers and I guess that&#x27;s the individual or body of powers that decides who has the right clearance to know so um I&#x27;m curious your thoughts about that what they&#x27;ve done over the years here is that this particular subject is not necessarily classified but it&#x27;s proprietary they have brought this out of the hands of the government and put it into privatized industry like the main defense contractors and so what they did long time ago they figured this out a long time ago 40s and 50s when there was a crash retrieval the government cut a dirty deal with the defense contractors and they said that we don&#x27;t care what you can what you need to do and you can privatize this you can commercialize this you can trickle the technology down you can make billions in profits all we want to know are two things uh what is the propulsion system of these vehicles and what is the weapons advancement technology associated with these vehicles and that&#x27;s the deal that the defense contractors cut with the government did you get this information from an Insider or someone who is a part of this agreement well there&#x27;s something called the revolving door phenomenon so let&#x27;s just kind of role play this here a little bit let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a defense contractor somewhere out in Air Force plant 42 Palmdale and you you really want to get this multi-billion dollar bomber contract you&#x27;ll talk to your highlevel military brass at the Pentagon he will Grease the skids for this defense contractor and and get him to get this contract now when when that same high level military breast Personnel retires he is he is retained as a consultant by the very same contractor that got this contract so you can see it&#x27;s this revolving door phenomenon and these guys scratch each other&#x27;s back they help each other and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s been going on for decades now right right yeah this is what we have tried to really get clear about what the Deep State means these unelected officials who play this leading role in National Security decisions having often a higher security clearance than the president and uh shapes covertly behind the scenes with other corporate players and now venture capitalist all this whole revolving door between the Pentagon and the venture capitalist world as well so um I&#x27;m curious your thoughts about the Kingman Landing Kingman Arizona 1953 uh this is in May 18th 1953 Harry Drew used to be the world&#x27;s Premier researcher on this case he&#x27;s no longer with us so all we have now is his legacy and he mentioned that there were three bodies recovered all alive there was another body human light being recovered for a grand total of four uh this thing was about 35 ft in diameter it had a dome on top there were ridges around the outer circumference of the craft itself uh this was a forced Landing not necessarily a crash retrieval there was a group of 40 Engineers that left Phoenix made a three-hour drive up to keman they got there at night and the engineers left the bus according to their expertise they eventually got this craft on an M25 tank transporter got it on a barge across the Colorado River and according to Harry drew it was sent to Area 51 which is where the story gets a little bit murky but according to Harry drew it was sent to Area 51 prior to the U2 uh spy plane test flights back in 55 Michael when I looked at your work one thing that was really impressive was how you&#x27;ve brought a lot of these incidents to life with art and I just think that&#x27;s so cool because it makes it much more approachable for an average person you know an average person reading a Dusty old document you know they don&#x27;t get too excited about it but when they can actually see a rendering like a high quality rendering of something based on all the descriptions you&#x27;ve got uh that makes a big difference so I just wanted to point that out oh thank you that&#x27;s great that that&#x27;s been my goal this whole time taking these Legacy crash retrieval firsthand military sources taking their testimony looking at it very carefully and then working with my sketch artist Rudy Rudy Gard is my sketch artist you know we kind of rough this thing out according to the witness we want to stay historically accurate and then once we get that done I have another artist that I work with his name is Joel and then we do a full color rendering to make these cases come alive that that&#x27;s really the goal and I&#x27;ve actually got the book here uh this is the first book this is a book called uh Magic Eyes Only and this is by Ryan wood there&#x27;s 100 Crush retrieval cases in that book the other book is the book by Leonard Stringfield that&#x27;s this book uh UFO crash retrievals 119 cases in there so between these books uh there&#x27;s illustrations that I worked on this has been a three-year crusade to make these cases come alive so that we can see them visually the criteria I used on a lot of these historical UFO cases is if there was a three-page report a drawing sketch or illustration and then a flight path report if it met that criteria I went ahead and moved forward with a detail drawing and a full color rendering and that was the the basis and criteria I used for a lot of my historical cases a lot of people have entered the UFO field like Gary McKinnon who was the computer hacker that was able to hack into the NASA system and see a folder where there were photoshopped photos where they actually took out UFOs they airbrushed it out um but he hacked the systems because he wanted to see if there were any free Energy Technologies that covert elements within the government had so I&#x27;m curious about any scientific breakthroughs or anything like medical breakthroughs are you aware of any Technologies of that regard personally I believe it&#x27;s across the board uh they&#x27;ve made Aerospace breakthroughs they&#x27;ve made invisibility cloaking breakthroughs they&#x27;ve made medical breakthroughs handheld scanners that we can scan the body and determine it what it&#x27;s condition health and also treat from the same scanner are these things real well I can tell you personally that we&#x27;ve been working on them and we have them cure cancer yes diagnose and cure technologies that can help get rid of the toxics that can clean the air that help get rid of the uh need for so much fossil fuel or help be it become more efficient if this technology was brought out overnight you would Doom the oil industry you would Doom the internal combustion industry you would take out the coal fire plants you take out the nuclear power plants you take out all the wind farms you take out all the solar Farms a multi- trillion dollar industry would be obsolete overnight if they release this technology I think it&#x27;s kind of hilarious how we have like the F35 jet program that&#x27;s like r with failures and the estimate is that it&#x27;s going to cost taxpayers 1.7 trillion for the duration of the program and a helmet is $400,000 and then more than half of the fighter jets aren&#x27;t even ready for combat so that&#x27;s like the reality we see that does get covered in the media so what they do sometimes is they rob Peter to pay Paul for example if you have a classified black star program what you would do is you would siphon off money from the A2 Avenger 2 program and move it over the Black Star program so that nobody knows and that that&#x27;s how they hide these budgets they they steal from one program to fund another one and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of how they keep a lot of this under wraps so do you think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on with the F-35 program that some of those funds are being diverted to these black budget programs there are a lot of programs that were born black they died black we&#x27;ll never hear about it I will also say that many times what we see kind of in the white world is a sacrificial lamb for another program behind the scenes so like anytime you see a white World program that might just be funding for something way in the back somewhere y that&#x27;s the best way to answer that at your uh Workshop about the black budget at contact you had a great visual of the three tiers of Technology um could you speak more on that basically when you talk about tier one technology these are your ordinary Garden variety vanilla flavored aircraft these are your f-15s your f-16s your a10s things that kind of are in the industry in the field right now uh things that you would see at your local Air Show this is your tier one tier 2 programs are your somewhat recently Declassified programs that were from the black world and now into the white world these are your F-117 Stealth Fighters your f-22s your b2s your Boeing Phantom Works bird pre all at one time these were absolutely black programs and they have now been moved into the white world and they&#x27;re in the field now or they&#x27;re in museums now tier three the aircraft that I like to focus on are the classified unacknowledged special access programs that kind of circumvent the Newtonian laws of physics these are your Hudson Valley boomerangs your Belgium triangles your January 5th Southern Illinois triangles these are the kind of craft that can depart like a spark on a grinding wheel and make no Sonic Boom long before Apollo 11 so that&#x27;s your tier three fre aircraft after your presentation I realized that what many people would see in the sky and say wow look at that UFO could it be aliens it could be tier three technologies that the US military is experimenting on some alleg that the uh Infamous Tic Tac video was actually a reverse engineered craft made by humans have you looked into that at all what I believe is going on there is we have a Blue on Blue situation here we have AER Americans chasing Americans there&#x27;s one witness that&#x27;s come forward he was there he believes it it&#x27;s a man-made project by the defense contractors um I I definitely agree with this because I&#x27;ve got cases back from 1967 in white con Pennsylvania that has the same identical Tic Tac shape with prongs sticking up and spheres at the end of the prongs now if you look at the high defition footage on the TIC teac UAP um it also has these prongs coming down there so you can see there&#x27;s a legacy to this technology it doesn&#x27;t even need to be reverse engineered it could be something that&#x27;s just man-made completely uh you know we we don&#x27;t want to underestimate the Ingenuity of American Engineers absolutely I don&#x27;t know if we need to put the ET card on it now possibly it was a reverse engineered program but if you look at the newspaper clippings uh breakthrough was made October 1954 the newspaper clippings bear this out because they talk about about cracking the gravity barrier they talk about multiple defense contractors that are desperately trying to crack the gravity barrier universities were doing the same thing this is all in the mid1 1950s and then a lot of this information went black so personally I believe they&#x27;ve made the Breakthrough they&#x27;ve got the technology and it&#x27;s just a humbling reminder for all of us who want to know that whatever interesting UFO we see out there it may or may not be connected to ETS and it really just could be experimental Advanced military aircraft that they&#x27;re testing correct and what what they like to do because what we&#x27;re dealing with here is the varsity team uh we&#x27;re dealing with Counter Intelligence we&#x27;re dealing with the international intelligence Community the CIA and and what they like to do is they like to paint their own black aircraft programs with the ET brush so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re happy they love to think they want everyone to think that these things are alien their ET technology it is a great cover for their own deep black programs that they&#x27;re brilliant at this they would love to publish things at the supermarket checkout and have us all believe that it&#x27;s ET technology when in point of fact it is our own classified black budget funding paid for by American taxpayers that are actually funding designing and fing these aircraft of these Technologies in in tier three um do you think it could be like a situation like Philip Corso head of the foreign technology desk who allegedly investigated the Roswell Tech that said that you know everyday products like bulletproof vests fiber optics that they took elements from this ET Tech and seated it to American companies and so it was like an integration of ET and human design well done well done uh the research that&#x27;s been done on Roswell clearly indicates that some of that debris was sent to B Memorial Institute they were looking at it battel is a major player in this the oldest defense contractor in the United States so it makes sense that they would have a need to know some of that debris was sent to to battel some of it was sent to R Patterson Air Force Base foreign technology division they looked at it many cases they&#x27;re they&#x27;re trying to look at the Material Science and after all these decades and billions of dollars we would absolutely certain hope that we got something for our our funding we would hope to think that you mentioned Area 51 and I know for a while Area 51 it was like um considered to be a conspiracy considered to not be real and then eventually they came out and said yes Area 51 was real and I know that Area 51 is one of um at least a handful of military bases that allegedly have these Technologies um particularly ones that are connected to extraterrestrial technology when it comes to unacknowledged special access programs that the president can&#x27;t get access to what they like to do here in the military industrial complex in the intelligence Community they like to diversify their portfolio they&#x27;re not going to put everything in one basket early on the retriev discs were sent to back in the 40s and 50s right Patterson Air Force Base absolutely right Patterson Air Force Base and that is still a primary area where they keep a lot of this however they also compartmentalize this information and they keep transferring assets from one facility to the next so that nobody knows the full story here that&#x27;s the two way ways that they keep this stuff classified so we&#x27;ll do a list here right Patterson Air Force Base for sure Area 51 for sure tonopa test range not too far from area 1 in Nevada for sure you also have mcdill air force base in Tampa Florida you have edland Air Force Base where a number of ET bodies were taken this is according to M Maran blackm McGruder who saw the Survivor of the Roswell incident and he saw it in April of 1948 and we also have Doug way proving Brown in Utah these are the primary areas of course Edwards Air Force Base North base north base is where they do a lot of the classified work I&#x27;ve got multiple sources and references that there is in point to fact definitely an underground facility at Edwards for sure if you could go to one military base to study what they have and somehow evade attack being attacked by the powers that be which military base would you go to I think the only one comes to mind right Patterson Air Force Base I mean that has been Ground Zero for decades there there probably still is assets there at one time had the Blue Room there Curtis couldn&#x27;t even go in there Barry Gold water did not get access there so something was definitely their probably 40s 50s 60s up to the 70s after that time there&#x27;s some information to indicate that a lot of the assets were moved and diversified to other locations but if we could go back in time let&#x27;s say 1960 time frame I&#x27;m sure we would find a lot at rright Patterson Air Force face and probably to this day as well I believe that technological advancement is broadly good um I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s totally beneficial to humanity and yet there are ways that people use technology that are clearly harmful with emerging Technologies you know that you&#x27;re aware of how would you ensure that the newest most powerful technologies that are coming out would be more likely to be used to help people rather than to harm them very good question uh the best way to answer that is a statement that was made by Gordon Cooper original mercury7 astronaut he was a big proponent in declassifying technology and and he believes the way this could be handled properly is if the information is given to a United Coalition of scientists and engineers and then they release the information that way we can have checks and balances we could have independent confirmation we can have repeatability and we can have the scientific method used in these different technologies that is the the best vehicle for disclosure in a democracy the decision on where to draw the line between the citizen&#x27;s right to know um right and the government&#x27;s National Security obligations can be a fine line so I&#x27;m curious where you draw the line given the nature of your work in your studies I do believe that sources means and methods should be kept under WS however there should be a sunset Clause built into a lot of these programs after 30 years if there&#x27;s no threat to the National Security of the United States a program should be Declassified or if there&#x27;s a 40-year time period there&#x27;s no threat to National Security they should be declassifying this stuff they they over classify this they lock this stuff up for decades and it never get seen they could probably declassify 40% of things that were procured under Reagan administration and there&#x27;d be no threat to Nation they could do it absolutely but it&#x27;s just such a monstrosity there&#x27;s so much paperwork involved there&#x27;s political things involved there&#x27;s personalities involved and it&#x27;s debatable with what if we&#x27;ll ever get to see a lot of these programs there definitely needs to be a United Coalition of Engineers and scientists that could look at this information all of the information that we got from the crash retrievals and the technology and we could have a team panel decide would this be advantageous to declassify or would it be more of a a harmful threat and if it pass that criteria that information should be Declassified a lot of these crash retrievals they&#x27;re 70 years or older now do they really need to hold on to this I I can see what they&#x27;ve done you know because they just stamped everything with a classification usab top secret uh Cosmic Top Secret at least 50% of our history has been lost in CL classified we don&#x27;t even know 50% of our history from World War II because they have literally stamp classified on so many millions of documents we don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re ever going to know our actual history and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important for us to track down these Legacy Witnesses so that we can get the information that will lead to their bosses which will eventually lead to the locations where they either had this information or have it now so there should be some Sunset Clause 20 20 or 30 years and then mandatory declassification review I&#x27;m curious what your thoughts are about the UAP disclosure act because we it&#x27;s really the clearest political legal path we&#x27;ve seen um and I know that new paradigm Institute Danny Sheen and his team are working tirelessly to get Congress um on board and to reinstate those Provisions back into the 2025 ndaa so any thoughts about that I have the highest hopes for a government type disclosure however we&#x27;ve kind of seen the track record here they have tried 80 years to get this information out in into the public domain using the Democratic process and it has failed us to this point UAP disclosure uh Provisions in place for the witnesses to come through and then there was going to be another follow on to that where this legislation would actually have some teeth to it where we could subpoena these Witnesses and we could get to their bosses and then we would go into these facilities and get the bodies well we know what happened the defense contractors came in and paid off these politicians so that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re up against um I I don&#x27;t know if I put out too much hope I have hoped that this could be but I&#x27;m just concerned that when you&#x27;re dealing with UFO crash retrievable Hardware bodies Disk type craft propulsion system Weapons Systems it is buried so deep within the defense contractor proprietary world I don&#x27;t think that members of the United States government have a need to know one and number two have the high enough security clearances to get access to this information that&#x27;s why personally I feel it is imperative that we track down these Legacy military witnesses to get their testimony before it&#x27;s too late and I still believe to this very day and I believe Tom KY will back this up with me is that there are people in Roswell right now as we speak this very minute and we know that the civilian population got to the debris field got to the crash scene before the military did so there&#x27;s people in Roswell right now that have part of parts of the debris they have probably IE beams they have uh the memory metal that information has been handed down through the generations and so we believe that there is still hardware and material in civilian hands in Roswell right now speaking of Tom Cary he wrote that book and um featured the story of the 12-year-old school girl Frankie DWI who allegedly saw that material you said where it turns into liquid at at the firehouse that her dad worked at and she was threatened by military police and said the desert&#x27;s a big b big place out there but you know 70 years later maybe if there&#x27;s like a congressional hearing and they hold this thing up for the whole world to see that might be an interesting image well you can see what&#x27;s happened here we&#x27;ve got these Witnesses coming forward but they&#x27;re onesies and twozies like we have David grush come forward now everything that he talked about he heard about it secondhand he did not have any firsthand knowledge of these he didn&#x27;t deal with Hardware firsthand he got it secondhand what we need to do is we need to have firsthand military sources current not retired but current who have firsthand knowledge dealing with this the stakes are high with any of these Technologies or secret programs being exposed and so this UAP disclosure Act is really um a great way to document our efforts and show that we&#x27;re not backing down we the people want to know so we&#x27;ve got all this like momentum right and I know it&#x27;s mixed bag because of how classified these subjects are so given your work and your your fight and your effort to uh educate people about all of these classified subjects what keeps you inspired to keep this work going I&#x27;m inspired by getting the drawings and illustrations done I&#x27;m curious just like everybody else I want to know where my tax dollars have disappeared I&#x27;d like to see what these craft look like that these engineers and people who are on the retrieval teams what did they actually see according to their accounts uh you know these are the people who saw the bodies on the pathologist teams who actually did the autopsies these are the people who loaded these craft onto 18 wheeler tractor trailer lowboy trucks and ship them to R Patterson Air Force Base I want to know what they know what have they seen what did they experience where was the information sent what facilities around the government around the United States what repositories do they have where they&#x27;ve got the gun camera footage the 8 by10 glossy white black and white photographs all of the Motion Picture film reels they&#x27;ve got warehouses of this this is what we need to move this whole field forward where can people find you to follow your work and stay updated sure uh you
