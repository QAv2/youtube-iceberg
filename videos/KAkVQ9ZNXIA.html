            <p>The propellantless drive is one of the most controversial aerospace technologies in recent history. It runs on electricity without any propellant. And in space, this would allow it to run for years, even decades. If it&#x27;s real, it could lead to gamechanging interstellar propulsion or even reach a place like Mars in a few weeks. Yet, it is contradictory to our conventional understanding of physics, and they apparently break the conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that they are interacting with Earth&#x27;s electromagnetic field. And even if that&#x27;s true, it would still be a gamecher for aerospace applications. Ultimately, this drive has to be replicated and verified in other labs. And even though the possibility of it being real is remote, it could potentially be one of the most revolutionary aerospace propulsion systems. Now what has everyone talking is probably the claim from Charles Buer who is an exNASA electrostatic expert and he has claimed to have built an asymmetrical capacitor that works in a vacuum and produces 1g of thrust and that would be pretty incredible if it actually worked.</p>
<p>But this actually goes decades back to a gentleman called Thomas Brown and he apparently built a very similar device. This device contained dialogic materials with electrodes that produced a net force towards the smaller electrode, otherwise known as the Bfield Brown effect. Yet, there&#x27;s a lot of debate on how high his vacuum really was and if it still had air. This is really important because the counter claim is that his device was simply an ion lifter utilizing whatever air particles were left in the chamber. The ion lifter is still very interesting in itself because it&#x27;s an electrohydrodnamic thruster that has no moving parts or propellers.</p>
<p>You might have seen these on YouTube and there&#x27;s some pretty fascinating designs out there and basically they use high voltage electricity to push air molecules and provide the thrust. The air is technically its fuel source, so it does not violate any known physics, but it should not work in a high vacuum because there would be no air molecules for it to use. Fast forward to today and we get to Dr. Beer&#x27;s claim that this does indeed work in a vacuum. So in his design, the two electrodes are different in size or shape and this allows you to produce a net force in one direction.</p>
<p>At least in theory, that&#x27;s how it works. So this leads us to the question of what does vacuum mean? And how do we even measure that? Well, to is a unit of pressure. It&#x27;s a measure of how much stuff or air molecules are left in the chamber. Sea level is about 760 to and many conventional vacuum devices can go 10 the minus3 to. But the problem is is you would still have air molecules left in the chamber.</p>
<p>So you would still have ion wind effects. But what really caught my attention and credit to Tim Venture of Propulsion is that in their experiments it was claimed to perform at 7.4 * 10 -6 to at 9500 volt 1,000 micro of thrust. Now, if you compare this to an ion lifter at 20,000 volts, you&#x27;ll get about 50,000 microons of thrust at ambient pressure. Now, obviously, these are estimates, but if you&#x27;re reducing the pressure by a factor of 100 million and you&#x27;re still getting 120th of the ratio of thrust compared to a ion thruster, well, it&#x27;s highly probable that it&#x27;s not due to ion wind effects. And that&#x27;s probably what caught Charles Beer&#x27;s attention is that there&#x27;s no way that this is just a conventional ion lifter.</p>
<p>There would definitely be other factors like the force sensor being isolated from the chamber walls and electromagnetic effects. So there would still be the possibility of this just being some type of error. The problem is is that other labs should try to replicate or disprove this claim. But for the most part it&#x27;s considered pseudocience and that&#x27;s a big problem. So there is another experiment that has been proven that has some weird effects and it&#x27;s called the Casmir effect and it&#x27;s where you have two plates in a vacuum and they go towards each other with a small amount of force.</p>
<p>Now some nothing should cause them to go towards each other. But what is believed is that it&#x27;s caused by 0 point energy and actually 0 point energy is why helium does not freeze when it gets to near absolute zero. And it&#x27;s a belief that this is causes atoms to oscillate and move around when there should be nothing there and they should actually solidify. So somehow maybe the system is retrieving zero point energy and maybe that&#x27;s why these capacitors work in a vacuum. So another propulsion system that is getting a lot of attention is the Astramm drive and it&#x27;s another propellantless electricitydriven thruster.</p>
<p>The claim is is that this drive utilizes a phase change cycle. So liquid to gas and then back to liquid. By managing these transitions precisely, the system allegedly creates internal gradients where the force is generated in one direction. Now, Newton&#x27;s third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So just like any other propeleness drive, it actually shouldn&#x27;t work in a vacuum.</p>
<p>But the important factor of this experiment is that it contains super fluid helium 4. And this is a state of matter that has zero viscosity allowing it to flow without losing kinetic energy. It is also believed to contain 0 point energy. And this prevents it from solidifying when it&#x27;s getting cooled down to near absolute zero. So the super fluid still remains in the state and you can make it flow from one position to another.</p>
<p>So, is this drive using quantum interactions that allows it to push against the vacuum itself? Well, that raises the question. Is our understanding of the vacuum incomplete? Is it actually empty or is it acting more like a medium, like a fluid, and the super fluid drive is interacting with this medium? If this is true, it could also explain why Charles Beer&#x27;s capacitors are working in vacuum. Ultimately, a really good reference to kind of think about how this all works is actually the ion lifter. It does not have any onboard propellant or moving parts and it&#x27;s simply utilizing the medium to propel itself in the air. So maybe these propellantless drives are not propellantless at all.</p>
<p>And maybe there&#x27;s a different thing going on here that we have yet to understand. But more importantly, I would like to know what you think. So, please leave a comment, like the video if you enjoyed it, and make sure to subscribe to my channel.</p>
