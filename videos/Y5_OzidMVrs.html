            <p>[Music] los angeles county is the nation&#x27;s largest municipal government with more residents than most states and a multi-billion dollar budget that&#x27;s bigger than that of kansas montana and vermont combined we work all year long to build a budget that meets the needs of our 10 million residents here&#x27;s a look inside the process we start in january when county departments submit their budget proposals to the ceo the ceo evaluates those proposals and makes recommendations to the board of supervisors state law requires the county to always balance its budget and just as with the household budget that means making hard choices based on how much funding is available county funding comes primarily from three sources federal state and locally generated revenues like property and sales taxes most of this money is restricted to support specific programs that the county is legally required to provide like public health care assistance to children and families keeping our communities safe and running fair and accessible elections the budget also funds culture education and recreation including world-class museums and beaches an expansive park system and an extensive network of community libraries it also supports programs to address some of our toughest social problems and sets aside rainy day funds to keep services running when times get tough it&#x27;s all guided by the policy vision of the board of supervisors including strong commitments to anti-racism equity and social justice these values established through a set of board-directed priorities shape the recommended budget which the ceo submits to the board for consideration in mid-april in may the board holds public hearings so that residents and other stakeholders can voice their opinions on the budget next comes the adopted budget which is traditionally approved by the board before june 30th and finally the supplemental budget in october to incorporate state federal and other allocations once approved the county&#x27;s final adopted budget becomes its spending plan that&#x27;s a quick snapshot for more information visit ceo.lacounty.gov and click on the budget tab</p>
