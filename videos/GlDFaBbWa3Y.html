            <p>so we&#x27;re here at the lab in hawthorne new jersey and i have a uh mobile camera that i used to uh oh well let&#x27;s show us around the lab and let me show you guys what it is we are doing over here uh jeremiah&#x27;s working on some stuff on the board but uh this is a lab space that we recently just set up this is in addition to the faraday cage and the control room we have out on the other side of the lab there&#x27;s a bit of construction going on over there we&#x27;re renovating the bathroom and and some other stuff i&#x27;m not gonna join with audio on this one uh and this this is pretty much our lab setup uh we have the gyroscopes right now we only have one gyroscope this is for the uh gyroscope procession experiment uh they&#x27;re coming in from the united kingdom from great britain it should be here sometime later next week and we&#x27;re also working on alzafon which is the dynamic nuclear orientation experiment we have a we have two systems to run this experiment basically it&#x27;s a laminar magnetic field similar to what todd was talking about you create a laminar homogenous magnetic field and then you hit it with uh microwaves at the larmor processional frequency and it&#x27;s all laid out in in the book over here the paper written by uh frederick alsophone i&#x27;ve gone over this a couple times at apec uh anti-gravity present technology this was actually published in 1981 and they replicated the experiment in 1994 apparently with 80 weight loss within the first second so i thought it was a pretty promising experiment to try it does have a very high benchmark to enter this experiment because you do need you need a microwave source and it needs to be coherent microwave source it&#x27;s kind of hard to just use a um a regular microwave generator uh we&#x27;re using traveling wave tube we also have a clystron that&#x27;s capable of 3 500 watts the traveling wave tube is only capable of 20 watts we&#x27;re having trouble with the wave guides in order to get all the energy into the test sample this is pretty much laid out over here this is the waveguide i&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t look like this exactly and you have the north and south pole of the electromagnet or whatever magnet you are using and what that&#x27;s supposed to do is create a state of dynamic nuclear orientation where the nucleus of the atom is actually oriented and that should detach yourself from the earth&#x27;s gravitic field and possibly the inertial field there&#x27;s a couple different explanations to how this experiment would work have you know if it is successful so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s more theories than there are experiments in this uh in this regard um we&#x27;ve also worked extensively with uh thomas townsend brown&#x27;s work with the gravitator uh he calls this the bi-filled brown effect really it&#x27;s all about thomas thompson brown uh he&#x27;s just this is actually the only paper where uh byfield is mentioned and uh so far our replications have had mixed results uh we had one guy in vietnam nam tran who tried these experiments he&#x27;s always getting positive results and then he sent over his capacitors to us to try them and we were getting null results using our dc power supply and we since realized that the power supply may be you know the signal input to the parallel plate capacitor may be more important than the capacitor itself and given the type of technology that he had at the time it&#x27;s possible that it wasn&#x27;t a very clean dc signal there might have been a dc bias with a more more of an ac form on top of that or an inverted sawtooth and that that is something that we&#x27;re looking into we actually have the components to build that and try that experiment that in that fashion um i don&#x27;t believe this is warp drive right now our current theory is that it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s more of a electron rocket of some sorts and it would create a bit of propulsion which when used in conjunction with the uh dynamic equal orientation experiments which will pretty much remove all the inertial mass of the craft you can then use a small amount of thrust to uh you know propel the craft in whatever direction it is you want to go and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of what like mark mccandless&#x27;s arv picture shows where you have the parallel plate capacitors in the base and uh you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s these uh big coils and there&#x27;s an aluminum flywheel it&#x27;s kind of important to use aluminum for this because aluminum maintains its dynamic nuclear orientation better than most materials the way the dynamic nuclear orientation is created is by applying the homogeneous magnetic field which as as todd mentioned is pretty difficult to achieve an epr electromagnet is you know the ideal you know it&#x27;s that&#x27;s what&#x27;s already that&#x27;s that that&#x27;s the the standard uh approach uh but those things are very big and very expensive and hard to find we do know of one that&#x27;s in south america in a dumpster that we might try to salvage but it&#x27;s been there for a couple of years it&#x27;s probably uh all corroded but these these devices are pretty hard to find so we had to build one ourselves then you have the sample in the center of the homogenous magnetic field and what and having a sample in the center of a homogeneous magnetic field what that does is it orients the electrons based on the strength of the magnetic field and they precess which is the ax the spin of the axis at the larmor procession which is way up in the gigahertz range which is why we have to use microwaves it&#x27;s really about tuning the microwaves to the strength of the magnetic field and pulsing the microwaves as well because every time you pulse the microwaves it energizes the energizes the electrons and then that orientation can then turn off the microwave force can then transfer its orientation to the core and you slowly build up a orientation in the core and basically creating nuclear magnetism which is pretty much what this effect should be called in my opinion and once you have that the craft should lose its inertial mass and detach itself from the gravitic field because second law of thermodynamics states that everything goes toward a state of entropy goes from water to disorder so in the core of atom we can expect there to be a lot of entropy there&#x27;s all the subatomic particles are probably spinning processing in all different directions with very intricate spins and it&#x27;s possible that that is what creates the inertial frame in the first place by by having all these spins and these processions and processions of processions uh when you move an object through space-time what you&#x27;re actually doing is you&#x27;re in adding an inertial energy to it or kinetic energy to it what you&#x27;re actually doing is energizing the subtonic particles in the core of the atom which is where all the mass is stored and then when it hits you know when the baseball hits the bat all those spins all change um but if you orient all of the spins and they&#x27;re no longer incoherent make a state of coherent matter the craft will then essentially become weightless and as david alzafon stated in his book he actually wrote a couple books on this is the son of the uh the inventor um frederick oswan so this is david alsfon&#x27;s two books that he wrote and they&#x27;re published on amazon um that it&#x27;s also possible that this can create um an invisibility system because we&#x27;re all interacting over here like even on this table we&#x27;re interacting with the electron field we&#x27;re not interacting with the core of the atom the core of the atom is what creates the inertial mass but the interactions that we&#x27;re having here are really with the electron fields if you oriented all the electron fields it&#x27;s possible that light will be able to travel straight through the hull of the craft and that can explain many of the phenomena that i&#x27;ve seen around flying saucers and such um but this does not create propulsion this just gets rid of the inertial mass you know if it works and propulsion can be created with uh possibly with this experiment we&#x27;re also trying the uh podcon of impulse experiment using superconductors and uh uh that is that paper is over here this is uh from pogba if you&#x27;re all very familiar with this this is actually from tim ventura&#x27;s american anti-gravity and they used a marks generator similar what where we have over here and we are trying to build a marks generator ourselves we have a whole bunch of passers and uh jeremiah can show you what we are doing with that so far yeah so we went on ebay and got a bunch of these surplus 30kb uh 1000 picofarad capacitors they&#x27;re really nice and decent polypropylene capacitors so they&#x27;ll have a very low esr because of the technology that&#x27;s used and they also have a fairly high resilience to uh partial over voltages where they can still operate even if there&#x27;s a problem with one of these gaps so uh we we got a total of uh eight of these or ten of these boards each contains eight capacitors we were missing one we went through and tested all of them we found a total of seven bad capacitors that we&#x27;re not going to be using in this system so what we ended up with is a bunch of these really nice thick pieces of printed circuit board here with some terminals and we matched ball terminals and some metric stainless steel screws so this is all stainless hardware with these points and what we&#x27;re going to end up doing is uh in order to control the discharge voltage the nice thing that uh we got in our ebay purchase is that these two boards are mirror images of each other so we can put them on hinges and by placing the ball electrodes between the already positioned points on these boards and the spacing which is already 30kb same as our capacitors we can adjust the discharge gap and control our output voltage and our output power so we&#x27;re going to be reconfiguring all the capacitors that came on here and i think we&#x27;ve decided on a 960 kilovolt system that gives us two capacitors per uh set so it&#x27;s just banks two caps all in series all the way up and uh this is what we&#x27;re considering for the uh impulse discharge so i cannot hear jeremiah at all i can&#x27;t hear you at all you need a bet you need to be michael can you uh can you hear me now much better okay it&#x27;s the lapel mic then oh once you scrap mine why don&#x27;t you just shut yours off and i&#x27;ll turn mine on because it&#x27;s already attached to me oh it&#x27;s been turned off okay i&#x27;m sorry about that uh technical technical difficulties can you can you hear me or am i still coming through quiet i i i can hear you okay cool that looks good enough yeah so um our two our two options for our marks generator are we can use 64 of our capacitors that gives us a total of 28.8 joules of discharge energy 960 kv impulse now uh the advantage of a higher voltage in the pocket off impulse discharge experiment is that any distance between the superconducting emitter and the target electrode we can get a slightly farther distance we can get a larger quantity of electrons in that plasma stream because of that greater distance and also we have a higher electric potential that&#x27;s immediately presented from the marks onto the surface of the superconducting emitter so we we are thinking about going with a higher voltage just so that we have some wiggle room in order to guarantee we get a nice even surface plasma discharge because we want that initial high voltage impulse and we don&#x27;t want it to get stuck in just one plasma stream we want that current to expand wide enough with enough potential behind it where we have a quantity of electrons available to cover the full surface of the superconductor and guarantee we get current flow through any flux pin regions that are already present the other option was that we could use 72 capacitors and get a slightly higher discharge current and uh total energy of 32.4 joules and that would limit our output voltage to 720 kv it would make the marks generators slightly smaller and because it&#x27;s physically smaller the distance that the electrons have to travel the whole circuit would be consequently shorter which would give us technically a slightly faster impulse so even though we only have a small difference between 28.8 and 32.4 joules of discharge energy we should have with this configuration because it&#x27;s physically smaller by one quarter of the total length we should have a consequently faster wave front so we&#x27;re still negotiating that we think we&#x27;re going to go with the higher voltage but we would certainly appreciate input from any of you as far as what&#x27;s going to happen in the vacuum chamber and whether or not we need better current or you know higher voltages in order to achieve that even surface discharge plasma that pocket off talks about as a necessity for making the gravity impulse work the other thing we have just to kind of go over it we have some ybco superconductor according to poor and pockenoff they were custom-made superconductors that both scientists used and so we&#x27;re using commercial superconductors we&#x27;re not sure if they&#x27;re actually going to be suitable for a proper replication of podcanoff but we&#x27;re going to go ahead and go through the motions and do everything as if we have the right superconducting material so that we can get set up for it that way the only thing that we have to do is monitor superconducting emitter if we need one custom centered electrically bonding the superconductor to the surface we found out about the bilayer effect thanks to power and how you have these josephson junctions inside that superconducting material by injecting certain insulators dielectrics or other materials into the mixture and so uh we have to figure out how to properly electrically bond our superconductor to our drawers and junction material whatever we choose to use and uh in this case we&#x27;re going to use indium we think we tried with gallium live on air the other day and it was a uh it was a terrible disaster the gallium did actually stick when we applied some pressure with some electrical tape on the outside just to sort of pull the two pieces together but ultimately gallium is uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s rate of thermal contraction versus the copper that we use to bind and the superconductor they&#x27;re all far too different from each other and it peeled away so that happened right at super critical levels like literally about 10 degrees just before we hit supercritical so it held up pretty well for most of the part but once we got down to the real low temperatures something broke it off so we&#x27;re going to try indium instead indium is apparently a much more common used material it also doesn&#x27;t tend to eat into metals which is why it&#x27;s used in laser dials with gold surfaces so it doesn&#x27;t eat through the gold and cause an electrical contact issue then we have to work on a vacuum discharge chamber in this case we&#x27;re just using an acrylic tube we&#x27;re going to use a half inch thick wall four inch diameter uh cast acrylic piece probably about two feet long so that we can see the inside of the chamber and watch our plasma discharge we think this is really important because according to podcanoff&#x27;s papers the shape of the surface of the plasma discharge coming off the superconducting emitter determines the consequent intensity of the gravity impulse and so he was reporting that what happened is a almost cylindrical like form came off as a plasma from the surface of the superconducting emitter and if we don&#x27;t actually see that in our application then we know we have not faithfully replicated based on the reported information in his paper so that&#x27;s something else that we&#x27;re gonna do we think we figured out figured out the bilayer alternative thanks to poor so we&#x27;re gonna work on that too uh this is where we&#x27;re at with eugene pogginoff stuff and then the other thing that we&#x27;re really excited about this month is replicating richard van durk&#x27;s complex electric field systems because he&#x27;s got two great alternatives that he talks about last apec meeting he blew my mind and probably many of many other minds because he presented the mathematics and the necessary systems to talk about what happens to electric charges in different frames of reference and and how you can derive a non-zero force from a solid body where you have electric charges flowing in different frames of weapons or electric currents flowing in different frames of reference so we&#x27;re going to go ahead and replicate one of bandura&#x27;s older systems he has a rotary disk system that uses two physical disks one moves one doesn&#x27;t one is called the dot product disk and the dot product disk here is made of very small particles usually microspheres of some conductive material suspended in epoxy or uh situated in such a way that when these tiny little microspheres are charged up and you feed them with an electric potential that when there&#x27;s a very small change due to a relativistic field being applied to them the change in their potential does not have the ability to jump over and conduct current so basically the charge stays on these microspheres it doesn&#x27;t leave them and as a result they&#x27;re able to experience a non-zero force so our dot product disc we have some new epoxy where is our epoxy uh right there in the epoxy box great i&#x27;m gonna pull that down especially because richard is uh you know in the audience today i just pulled the whole box down i think i&#x27;m going to open this up and and uh pull off the data sheet here 670 so this is an incredibly thin no that&#x27;s not the seventh year 690. oh the 690 that yeah that&#x27;s the new stuff we&#x27;re going to work with so the 690 made by smooth on we&#x27;re going to try to use this as an epoxy it&#x27;s it&#x27;s incredibly thin um trying to see where our centipoise rating is on our sheet either way basically it&#x27;s uh oh it makes the area yeah here we go 280 uh centerpoint so it&#x27;s a very very thin epoxy and i think that&#x27;s going to really help us reach that saturation for our microspheres we have three materials that we can use right now we have a bismuth powder that&#x27;s mostly spherical we have a aluminum powder that should be satisfactory we have a nickel silver powder and uh jeez which is that that i pulled out the magnesium powder that i tested when i just did a pour test to sort of see if you uh if you&#x27;ve ever done a fine grinding on a powder and you try to pour out a large volume of it inside of a container just tilt the container back and forth if it&#x27;s spherical you&#x27;ll notice that it just seems to flow almost like a liquid it doesn&#x27;t act like a powder or a salt it doesn&#x27;t bunch up and uh so we have some magnesium part of that exhibits that property and we&#x27;re gonna go with it&#x27;s mostly spherical and try to inject a very large quantity of that to electrical saturation inside of the epoxy mixture so that we can charge up the microspheres but then allow them to maintain their charge as we rotate the cross product disc and so we&#x27;ll get to that well what about the bismuth powder the bismuth powder is another possibility and you know the great thing is we have multiple samples and plenty of epoxy so we can make we can make many different dot product discs that are going to allow us to try these different materials and their various properties we also have copper powder as well indeed we do the copper powder is pretty rough it seems like it&#x27;s starting to oxidize if you take a look inside so i think we might avoid that or we&#x27;ll have to do something to it to treat it um so the cross product this this we just need a very smooth conductive surface so that electrons can freely flow around it the thinner that surface is the better it&#x27;s gonna it&#x27;s gonna react we wanna keep them constrained down to that one axis as the cross product disc is rotating now last time richard revealed a very important piece of information which is you actually get better results if you rotate the doc product disk now that i haven&#x27;t mathematically comprehended as to why you may get better results if you rotate the cross or the dot product disc but my thinking was that the dot product is going to also experience forces from the electrostatic charges on the body of the enclosure uh that it may not actually that it wouldn&#x27;t experience at all if it was stationary compared to the body of the enclosure so perhaps that&#x27;s one explanation uh the cross-product disc is just going to be a cd-rom that we stuck a voltage multiplier on and blasted off all the metallic coning of it so we had a nice piece of plastic to work with and then we laminated that cd-rom with a piece of uh thin film mylar using some adhesive and pressed it down with some pressure to get a nice even surface so we&#x27;ll be spinning that up to 25 000 rpms and we have just a uh another cd-rom which all the printing was removed from so we have that metallic coating which is just a few ohms across the entire surface that&#x27;s another good solution for a cross product is where electrons can travel around it and you don&#x27;t get the equal and opposite charges because the electrons are free to move across the surface of the disk we also have those really cool um hobby electric motors that are capable of like one horsepower those things are tiny yeah those are going to give us quite a bit of torque especially if according to uh richard&#x27;s paper what happens is as you generate a linear motion from this system you end up with the result in torque on the motor that causes it to slow down or it loads the motor so those nice strong motors at high rpm will be able to provide plenty of torque not to say that we&#x27;ll probably ever even come close to loading a motor because the speeds that we&#x27;re talking about in the voltage differentials between the product and the cross product is are not realistically strong enough to cause us any significant power draw it would it&#x27;d be wonderful if you get materials that would allow us to do something like that you know or we could take a one horsepower motor convert it straight to linear momentum and use all that energy but i think we&#x27;re uh we&#x27;re a long ways away from that yet now right now we just want to test it out make sure that we understand properly what was presented what what richard&#x27;s theory implies and how to actually implement it and then we want to try our best to try to do a proper eugene pocket off discharge making sure that our experiment and the observations we make match the observations in the paper and thanks to the papers that tim sent over we have lots of information from core which is effectively on the same thing which we now can use to derive what&#x27;s going on with podcanoff right i&#x27;ll talk a little bit about the uh the rectifier tubes uh we have a couple of different options that&#x27;s a good point some of them are still on their way they&#x27;re coming from uh from russia i think the 400 kv ones uh we have a couple tubes up there what what kind of tubes do you think we need for this so what we ended up ordering is uh we took a look on ebay and tried to find some reasonably high voltage tubes because when ben dirk produced his patent in his pet he talks about using you know several kilovolts and we wanted to try to really push the boundaries of what the dielectrics could take so we&#x27;re going to try to go into the double-digit kilovolts and um in order to do that we needed some double digit rectifiers that could handle that voltage so we ordered some from russia they&#x27;re coming in and those are going to allow us to isolate our electrical power supply or our power source from the physical device itself so that electrons can&#x27;t backflow and if there&#x27;s an imbalance due to the changes in the electric fields from the complex the electric field interaction that we&#x27;re not going to have electrons flowing into or out of ground or the power supply can try to neutralize out those changes in potential so we&#x27;re going to use rectifier tubes we&#x27;re going to power them off 18650 batteries or other lipo small lipo batteries so that we can completely isolate that system and properly test what vendor has presented well also the oscilloscopes and any test equipment that we plan on attaching to this experiment is also going to be floated using a ups system completely separated from ground because i know that&#x27;s very important it was that big eureka to realize that most of the reasons why we were having problems and erratic results had everything to do with the fact that we always had some kind of leakage or connection to an earth ground and that caused us major issues because in earth ground effectively an electrical an electrical connection between two points in any system ties those two systems together into the same frame of reference and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s wild to think that you can connect different frames of reference with a piece of wire but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s effectively what you&#x27;re doing so you have to keep them isolated and to finally have learned about that and realized why we&#x27;ve seen some effects anomalously in very fast systems where the resistance of our electrical connections was actually not sufficient to totally separate out the frames of reference that&#x27;s why we&#x27;ve seen the effects it was a big eureka to realize why and uh again huge thank you to richard for uh presenting that so we finally understand okay okay yes oh yeah i&#x27;ve been listening here and i probably had a couple comments on what you had to say on this um please you had a question on that rotating the dot product disc uh yeah so so what you want to do is you know one of the things the dot product is generating is a scalar potential so uh when you rotate it you h you&#x27;re effectively taking the charge and um accelerating it 90 degrees to its relative motion well that causes the scalar potential to basically decouple from um the potential so it&#x27;ll build up around the individual particles as um say as you rotate them so that&#x27;s the reason why you really want to to rotate the dot product disk too because you&#x27;re going to end up starting to build up the scalar potential and then that actually you know the experiments we&#x27;ve done recently seems to show that has that has a much greater effect than um the cross product disk so if you can that would be a desirable thing is to get your dot product disc all balanced out and if you could rotate that in the opposite direction as the cross product disc i think you&#x27;ll have a better effect but yeah it sounds like you&#x27;re doing everything correctly you know just make sure you don&#x27;t get any past the ground and i think you should start seeing some good results and of course you&#x27;ll let me know when you start putting it together right absolutely richard i mean you&#x27;re you&#x27;re the reason why we&#x27;re doing this particular experiment and what you presented was as we said a huge eureka it just has a it&#x27;s a total difference in understanding why some things happen the way they do because we&#x27;ve seen strange effects for a long long time i&#x27;ve been doing this for now going on almost 22 years and i&#x27;ve seen a lot of really really weird things happen especially around very high currents with capacitor discharges around very high impulse voltages and i i&#x27;ve noticed a trend with these various things that i&#x27;ve seen with objects moving on their own or electronics being triggered by an em pulse that should have never existed from the amount of power that we had but it seemed to go a really really long distance uh it finally makes a lot of sense as to why you could be generating scalar potentials and and how they can transfer because the great thing about a scalar potential right is that you can&#x27;t really block it it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a point or it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a charge that&#x27;s going to expand out and that charge field is going to have an effect on all other objects you can&#x27;t really block a change in local electric potential from one potential to another it&#x27;s going to penetrate and that gives us the unique ability to change the field geometries of that generated signal source and screw around with scalar potentials in a way that i don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever even realized we should be looking into yeah yeah that seems to be the key here those scalar potentials what you&#x27;re able to read the live chats don&#x27;t resist there for a while too yeah jeremy go ahead if you uh have uh live chat questions i can&#x27;t hear you jeremy uh go ahead if you have live chat questions your sound just went completely dead i can&#x27;t hear anything uh no it says it&#x27;s on yeah i i can still just thank you that&#x27;s better i just came back so uh live chat questions jeremy uh over here we have our um a power supply racks just wanna show you this real quick um this is for the uh experiment this is a 30 30 volt 40 amp or a 40 volt 30 amp uh power supply it&#x27;s one of the really old kinds super heavy had to ship freight that&#x27;s to supply the super uh stable laminar magnetic field for the electromagnet uh up on top over here we have a maxwell 45kd this came out of sandia labs uh used equipment uh it&#x27;s 45 kv 8000 watts and i managed to get the matching capacitors also 45 kv capacitors uh here locally so that is for the uh the lower voltage version of the um impulse experiment with uh pod cloud for the super connectors um in order to read everything we got this out of singapore it is uh 16 giga cycles per second scope um the only way we could afford a scope this fast is by getting a super old one that still works and as you can see over here we actually had to buy these um i don&#x27;t know if you guys can still remember these things these are coming out of museums floppy disks and a floppy drive in order to read the data but uh the scope still works and it probably cost as much as a small house when it uh first came out over here we have this rack is really the super high voltage rack uh there&#x27;s a scope attached to it as well which we had to shield from our last experiment this was for testing the capacitors but uh basically this rack has a gamma 125 kv 5 milliamp power supply and below that is a 10 000 to 1 voltage divider and that&#x27;s hooked up to that oscilloscope so we&#x27;re able to see um high voltage potentials uh on a standard oscilloscope we could also hook that up to our 16 giga cycle per seconds oscilloscope to measure the impulse uh velocity rates uh you know for for any of these high voltage high current um experiments and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s most of our equipment right now we have also in this corner this is something that uh jeremy brought in this is a 5kv half amp power supply that&#x27;s going to be used for the klystron uh jeremy actually found that on craigslist from a lab that was going out of business and this is something that we couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else so it was amazing that he was able to bring that down to the lab for us and uh we&#x27;re currently really working on that i think that we&#x27;re gonna have to bypass one of the safety uh relays in order to just yeah we&#x27;re gonna bypass the internet comment on how heavy that thing is oh yes how did you get that into the car on your own that thing is very heavy i i think i actually i had help i had to get help i did i could not have moved it by myself no i i did have to have a second person help me move it and uh and transport it it&#x27;s got a huge plate transformer in the bottom that&#x27;s a beast now you can see the uh the front dials look at the size that dial that&#x27;s my hand yeah that&#x27;s some like 1940s old-school equipment that thing&#x27;s diesel nothing&#x27;s built you don&#x27;t find equipment like that anymore yeah so i think the this is the interlock there&#x27;s the problem with the uh that transformer is blown out it&#x27;s a 12-volt transformer so the interlocks are not working so we could either we could either replace the transformer or if we just override the interlock it&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re considering at its core all that thing really is effectively is a voltage divider for some meters and current a variac and a huge plate transformer that has multiple wiring configurations and uh all we have to do is give that variac power to feed the plate transformer the rectifiers are already in place and everything else should pretty much work straight forward there is no reason why we need an interlock in that system if we&#x27;re going to install it in a cabinet and bring out external cables anyways we&#x27;re going to be setting it up in our lab and we have sufficient signage to indicate the dangers of the system oh and something else that was really cool that he got from that same lab and they couldn&#x27;t explain it to jeremy why they had it was a whole bunch of wave guides that were tuned to a very specific frequency of 6.21819 gigahertz and they there&#x27;s a ton of two tuning that went into all these wave guys they&#x27;re several pieces of waveguide all tuned to a specific frequency and that that will work wonders for our experiment because if we can lock the uh the frequency in at a certain point we can just use this uh power supply over here to change the the uh the flux in the magnetic field and use that as our variable to finally find the lawnmower procession frequency by changing the magnetic field strength well that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s pretty much the summary of what we already have going on we are planning on a few other projects that we haven&#x27;t really written up yet these are the focus points right now we don&#x27;t want to get our hands in too many baskets we want to focus on the projects at hand which is parkland off and richard benderick so if we can we if we can get far enough along on either of those that we can make progress then we&#x27;ll move on to a few other projects perhaps this month or the uh the following months but that&#x27;s the update from the falcon space lab that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at right now we&#x27;re testing everything that we can and we&#x27;re focusing on the things that we think that we have at our current skill level and uh our reception with the communities things we can actually do and test properly because we&#x27;re not just trying to put together things that look kind of sort of similar to what scientists did we want to replicate as accurately as faithfully as possible exactly exactly that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the most important point is to be able to actually replicate them in the lab and i&#x27;m also excited about the aldo&#x27;s font thing i&#x27;ve been working on it for a while but we need to figure out the wave guides until we figure out the wave guides it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s all just a waste you know yeah the real trouble we&#x27;re having with waveguide issues right now is that we can beam out that signal at whatever frequency we choose from our frequency sources but that signal is basically hitting the sample and then flying past it and being lost in attenuation to the outside environment so what we need is a resonant chamber that we can tune for the frequency ranges that we&#x27;re using which is the 8.8 to 9.5 gigahertz range and then we need to design something else perhaps more powerful for our klystrons range that way we can get a nice q factor we can get many many times more power into the sample so that the sample itself absorbs that microwave energy instead of it just being lost in the environment or costing us swr issues down the line i&#x27;m just reading swr on a um on a microwave waveguide i mean there is no microwave waveguide swr meters out there it&#x27;s literally something you have to build yourself and uh we we&#x27;re talking to all the professionals in the field it seems like it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a real specialty there&#x27;s very few people who understand this stuff sort of an industry secret that&#x27;s an industry secret yeah like how do you design a proper waveguide with an incredibly high q to get energy into a sample how do you measure the queue in the first place and how do you measure the reflected energy these are all issues that we&#x27;re going to have to work on not stuff that you can easily google because i&#x27;ve spent many many hours on there trying to find this stuff out but unfortunately it seems like it&#x27;s just uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bit difficult maybe it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re just ignorant of the right terms to use we may not be looking up at you know the right information or we don&#x27;t even know what we&#x27;re looking at right exactly we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know so this is definitely where we&#x27;re asking for help to try to figure this problem out so we can test also bond properly and get energy into the sample to see if we get good dynamic nuclear orientation and we get good coupling from our microwave energy into our sample in terms of capabilities we also have a 3d printer over here that we can print in a resin that we can then cast in any different metal we have furnaces and we have casting materials so you want if you want to cast something in silver nickel or uh bismuth we&#x27;ve purchased a whole bunch of bismuth has a high spin ratio it&#x27;s a pretty interesting metal we thought it might be interesting to try something with bismuth um now also you have the uh the bilayer uh setup that was found as a supposed relic of a flying saucer and if uh you know if there is something to bismuth mixing with other metals and a bilayer that we can put into the uh alzhefon experiment that&#x27;s something i really want to try um so any any help from the community anyone who who knows anything about these experiments or knows somebody who knows how to work with microwave waveguides and tune them properly that will be very beneficial to what we&#x27;re doing over here and uh like i said before we we do have you know some limited funding from a uh from an anonymous donor and so far they&#x27;ve given us around thirty thousand dollars and uh this is what we&#x27;ve been able to put together with that do we have more equipment coming in the mail we also have a um a guest house available and he&#x27;s offered like if there&#x27;s any scientists who have relevant information to the experiments that we&#x27;re doing he&#x27;s glad to fund them to fly down here and all expenses paid and uh we can work on these experiments in this anti-gravity lab right here live and all of these videos all these experiments by the way are going to be published live on youtube jeremy reese and travis have worked out a system with multiple cameras you can see our first demo of that where we kind of made a makeshift experiment just to try it all out and uh that was that was really amazing how we were able to get all the cameras together and run an experiment live on youtube okay what happened all right i just want to remind everyone to smash that like button who&#x27;s watching this live and uh share this video with anyone you think who might be interested um again we&#x27;re going to be making like short clips of uh you know highlights and of key points and things and again we invite anyone from the audience who um has information they&#x27;d like to present and join this community anything that could contribute to the body of knowledge or the lists of or the experiments in the lab anyone who has equipment or anything else like that their time or lab time that they can offer to run certain experiments or if they have uh you know they can help us run these experiments basically like the goal is to bring more and more scientists on who no one knows stuff about this share the information in an open atmosphere and kind of accelerate the process of of um r d and disclosure really of the information because it&#x27;s uh some people think there&#x27;s a lot of people talking about disclosure right now but they don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re really willing to learn the real information um and put the time into to really wrap their head around this kind of this kind of knowledge that&#x27;s going to take to to build a the first you know the first craft that gets us off this planet um that&#x27;s really you know the goal here i know it seems like uh you know quite quite a quite a achievement for some of the people um out there maybe thinking like this might be this might be five ten years twenty years this might take our lifetime these guys have been working on it for quite quite a long time already and um that&#x27;s awesome that they&#x27;re here to share all their knowledge and experience with us um there&#x27;s no better teacher than failure um i say and um the more that we can demonstrate all these other experiments in the past and in a lab setting with uh you know a group of people that are really real skeptics that you know people have a track record that people can trust if we can vet these out in our own lab publicly one at a time it will save so many people so many wasted time or years of wasted time and their own wasted research and funds and everything because there&#x27;s so many videos on the internet showing these kinds of things and if we can we can show them and really get out vet them out and say like this doesn&#x27;t work this doesn&#x27;t work this doesn&#x27;t work you know that&#x27;s going to help save a ton of people&#x27;s time and if anyone out there has already done these experiments and knows you know how to set them up or has them already you know set up somewhere they can go and show us you know okay we&#x27;ve tried this this didn&#x27;t work this didn&#x27;t work that&#x27;s really where we need to go through because um and and do is prove to people that no they&#x27;re they&#x27;re you know at the same time it&#x27;s not not it&#x27;s going to vet out the whole um people like stephen greer who claim that there&#x27;s a secret space program that figured this all out back in the 50s and and if that was the case i don&#x27;t know what the heck you guys were doing working for darpa on all this stuff for the past 50 years if they already figured it out in 54 like steven greer wants to tell everybody uh and again if they did we&#x27;re going to figure it out we&#x27;re going to find it but if not and this is really is the cutting edge in humanity&#x27;s evolution um to the stars then uh we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to hopefully put the laboratory in the team and the scientists together to bring disclosure on on that level um and hopefully the scientific community is open open to that and uh you know and open to contributing with us you know not just you know the naysayer that there&#x27;s naysayers that just want to fight everything and and say oh you&#x27;re not going through the conventional channels and stuff like this guy was saying in the live chat um you know you should be doing peer review peer review will come like when we get something that is actually works and is worth you know writing a paper on we&#x27;re gonna i want to definitely write papers uh with with you guys and we we have a team people ready to do that when our lab does have success um i want to write papers and publish it in the peer review and get it out there but i i just we we also have a kind of a fear and a skepticism of that whole process that you know that whole system has been used to suppress information like this in the past so we want to do it publicly first demonstrate it and show people how to do it and and whatever works show people all the stuff that doesn&#x27;t work and then when we get it we should we know how it works we want to like have led up to it and and people that who have followed it to really have the knowledge and and the background to understand the science behind it when when we do have that success uh in the future and i really have confidence that we will with this team and the amount of people that are coming out of the community and bringing us um support and and hope um can you guys uh hear me all right wonderful yes you know wayne has his hand up also i should mention that yeah wayne go ahead yeah hey um yeah i just wanted to do um to share a couple of things little things that i&#x27;ve been working on uh and we&#x27;ll be working on in the near future um and it relates a lot to what todd was sharing about the nmr and um what you guys are working on and have worked on with also phone and all that so um i&#x27;ve been thinking about um how to maybe work this thing at lower frequencies uh so just using um the i made this last night so this is going to be there&#x27;s going to be two helmholtz coils oriented perpendicular to each other so the one will produce kind of a weak magnetic field i&#x27;m aiming for about 30 gauss and then i&#x27;m going to have across from that perpendicular going to have rf what won&#x27;t be rf something around the 20 kilohertz so i&#x27;m aiming for around the audio frequency range and i&#x27;m going to put some i have it i kind of calculated it to work with uh bismuth uh because i i have some powdered bismuth i&#x27;m working with and so i just put the sample in there and maybe suspend it um so that&#x27;s something interesting um and then here i had uh inside here between these two neo magnets is an epoxy um casting with bismuth powder in it and so i was uh and will be playing with that putting some uh ac magnetic fields in here and just putting it on a scale and seeing what happens with that here&#x27;s an older helmholtz helmholtz coil i made and yeah so this here is a capacitor i made it&#x27;s got uh bismuth powder in the middle with epoxy and uh dielectric and uh i was going to test it with uh different like high high frequency high voltage currents i&#x27;m thinking the that might excite some some effects inside the bismuth atoms so yeah i just wanted to give a little quick update um i&#x27;ll be posting all my stuff on my youtube channel bail forward research and uh yeah that&#x27;s about it thanks yeah let me compliment you on the quality of your builds now i mean they&#x27;re looking really really good you&#x27;re spending a lot of time putting them together uh as compared to the earlier experiments where we sort of crashed course our way to figuring this stuff out it looks like you&#x27;re you&#x27;re trying to up your game and that&#x27;s awesome to see yeah yeah i don&#x27;t have a lot to work with but uh you know i&#x27;m trying to do the best i can so yeah there&#x27;s a lot there&#x27;s a long way to go there&#x27;s a long way to go yeah great job wayne yep thanks guys and look forward to uh all of what you&#x27;re working on there that&#x27;s going to be amazing the other thing that i wanted to point out for sure especially amongst this community is once we build this equipment you know we we may not be the biggest experts in the industry on exactly how to use it but we have the equipment so when we have uh one mega volt marks generator or you know a 960 kv marks generator and you have an experiment that you want tested on it or an apparatus that you want hooked up to it i mean that&#x27;s something we&#x27;d be interested in testing out so we just want to sort of extend that that offer out there to people in this community where if you have devices that require weird uh equipment or specialized equipment like the types that we&#x27;re setting up here we would be interested in in collaborating with you and using what we&#x27;ve already acquired to try and test out your ideas and theories we can follow them like a scientific procedure and do exactly what you recommend to do to make sure that we test what you&#x27;re looking for wonderful well gentlemen should we do you think we should call them dave today only one minute if i find out if he&#x27;ll answer and uh i&#x27;d say give him a call well no i mean yeah i think it&#x27;s probably time time for us to wrap things up for today so yeah i i agree and uh i&#x27;m just uh typing some stuff away and getting some links together um we&#x27;re gonna put some links together for for this whole talk this was an excellent uh excellent discussion i learned a lot from our guests thank you thank you gary uh for being part of this and thank you todd and uh and thank you as always always tim for putting this together and um and uh was for tim well gary thank you again very very much and todd you as well you&#x27;re you&#x27;re hiding in my screen but i think you&#x27;re still here uh yeah there you are i&#x27;m losing there you go okay thanks to everyone who uh contributed um any anyone wants to give a shout out real quick to the end for a link or anything that they want to give a shout out they can go ahead and do that and then we&#x27;ll go ahead and wrap this up for the day fail forward research that&#x27;s wayne i&#x27;ll give a shout out to him and then also uh you guys can check out join the technicians although jeremiah is not really doing much with that channel anymore um and um and then i&#x27;ll give up i&#x27;ll post a link to uh um clay&#x27;s website for his disclosure project there um yeah and we&#x27;ll get gary&#x27;s material up as well so yeah and then i believe todd definitely send me over links there&#x27;s a newslink already too sorry wonderful okay well thank you again i just want to make a shout out to tim ventura made this entire thing possible oh thank you sir okay on that note let me let me hit this the stop button and we will wrap this one up this will probably be our last event for 2020 and there we go</p>
