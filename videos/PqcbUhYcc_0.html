            <p>foreign [Music] Hello friends Greg Braden here welcome to this edition of our questions and answers our q a I want to welcome you to our Channel if you&#x27;re new to the channel and if you are a returning viewer I want to thank you for all your love and support we appreciate you as I mentioned in the last video I&#x27;ve been traveling extensively in Live Events I&#x27;m responsible for my own content if I&#x27;m not here I&#x27;m not creating it so uh so they have been a bit fewer and further between in the last few weeks and I&#x27;m happy to be in the studio now at uh just outside of Santa Fe New Mexico uh here in our our little Studio where I get to create this content and I&#x27;m bringing to you uh the answers to questions that have come in over the last few weeks and you know this is really interesting to me because the questions they kind of come in Cycles so over the mid-January into early February all the questions not everyone but the majority were all about Finance blockchain technology Bitcoin is it safe uh you know what are your thoughts after the collapse of X FTX is this the end of crypto and I&#x27;ve answered those and all the ways that that I have if you didn&#x27;t see the other videos please check them out they&#x27;re in the links below this week what&#x27;s interesting is no questions about blockchain they&#x27;re all more spiritually oriented questions about us and our relationship to the changes into the world and I I like to address a couple of those uh one of those well this is a really interesting one one of these comes from Andy and once again as I always do I&#x27;m not going to share the last name to protect your privacy Andy I want to thank you uh at 10 40 a.m for writing this question to me we had been talking in some of the online free webinars and things like that about the fact that all the answers already exist all the big problems the technological answers already exist to the big problems in the world today and then they have for a long time energy Finance agriculture uh you know medical Technologies we&#x27;ve had the Technologies a lot of them simply have not been shared in the mainstream so the question is what would be the impact on individuals if these Technologies roll out on a large scale it&#x27;s a really good question we know that Technologies are being suppressed and and they have been you know probably as long as humans have had the Technologies because because some of the new technologies make obsolete entire industries that we have today and uh and there are people heavily invested in these industries they don&#x27;t want them to go away but I know I&#x27;ll tell you I I know firsthand I&#x27;ll just tell you a quick story I know firsthand about the suppression of these Technologies the first time I saw it I was surprised I was a budding young computer geologist in the 1970s during the first uh energy crisis when the the energy oil was cut off for the Middle East into into the West and we had to find our own sources of energy our instances of oil and we began exploring the North Slope Alaska Pluto Bay and uh the tremendous reserves in North Slope Alaska well it was during that time some of you may remember this we they rationed gasoline to 10 gallons per person per week this is 1970s I got to tell you the automobiles 1970s we were still living many were developed in late 1960s they were called muscle cars so beautiful Mustang GTs Pontiac GTOs Camaro Trans Ams Pontiac Trans Ams these were not gasoline efficient vehicles uh they were beautiful and fun they were not efficient and uh so 10 gallons a week wouldn&#x27;t get you very far uh especially if you&#x27;re driving that vehicle every day back and forth to work back and forth to school as I was 1969 Pontiac GTO beautiful machine so one of the things I discovered when I began working in the energy industry was that a carburetor had been developed that would allow the vehicle that this carburetor was placed into to get 90 miles to the gallon in in 1970s so if you can imagine these muscle cars getting 90 miles to the gallon then the carburetor the technology was pretty straightforward and so the question is you know where is that carburetor how come we didn&#x27;t use it why didn&#x27;t we start saving gas well that would not be good for the energy companies because people needed the energy so those the the patent for that carburetor was purchased by an oil company and they kept that patent under wraps so that carburetor was never to the my best my knowledge this day you know if we get 50 miles a gallon we still think that&#x27;s good and that&#x27;s with little cars that are made of uh you know they&#x27;re made of essentially fiberglass very lightweight not the the big heavy Vehicles so we still don&#x27;t have that that technology so I saw that happen firsthand and and that really opened my eyes to the possibility that technology could be suppressed like that and then as I worked in the industry from the energy industry into the defense industry uh and the physics and the physicists working with sources of energy became very clear that we have had the ability to produce clean green sustainable energy for at least 70 years and that technology has uh has not been shared as well and there are a lot of reasons for that so the question that&#x27;s being asked here is while we have small examples you know scientists come on YouTube and say I&#x27;ve got a free energy device that&#x27;ll you know run run your house and a few people use that so the question is what would happen um on a large scale if these things if these Technologies roll out on a bigger scale well it&#x27;s a really good question one of the first things that would happen would be the Fulfillment of uh of the possibility that I have mentioned in so many of my videos and that is the fact that we have everything we need to raise the standard of living for every child every man every woman on the face of the Earth and every nation that wants to have a higher standard of living and to do so without negatively impacting the resources our economy the Earth we could do that and one of the first pushbacks that I get is what about the number of people there&#x27;s so many people if we just keep having more and more people and that people have easier and easier and better and better lives you know where does that end well the answer that question is in another YouTube video put the link down below the uh the statistics are frightening when it comes to human population we are in trouble here on planet Earth a lot of people don&#x27;t believe that and they don&#x27;t see it because they&#x27;re not seeing it immediately in their own backyard here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening in 1970s there was a book called the population bomb Paul Ehrlich many of you remember this I read it you know when I was in school back in the 1970s that painted a very uh dark picture of human population continuing to grow on a geometric scale off the charts devouring all of the resources of the earth creating a lot of suffering a lot of pain and just an apocalypse apocalyptic view of our future of course that didn&#x27;t happen in the way that he envisioned because there were things he didn&#x27;t take into account number one he didn&#x27;t take new technologies into account that change the way resources are being used 1970s but number two we are not going to just continue to create a larger and larger and larger population as I described in the video uh in the link down below it was released a few weeks ago what the statistics are showing is that the fertility rates of the human species on the global level has fallen off a cliff it is dropping like a rock and there are a lot of reasons for that one of those reasons is global stress we are stressed in ways that we have never experienced stress before for periods of time lasting longer and you know typically the stress will be around the natural disaster or you know the uh the possibility of a war and then events happen so that we know one way or another where we&#x27;re going and what&#x27;s happening right now is we don&#x27;t know we have so much uncertainty in our world and in our lives on so many different levels finances economies jobs um National sovereignty National Security climate I mean just on and on so it has created the Perpetual stress that apparently is taking a toll on global fertility rates but even beyond that and I&#x27;m going to be a little redundant if you haven&#x27;t seen the other video I just want to share some of the the statistics with you here male sperm counts are on the decline they have been for the last 40 years or so what the when they do the global sperm counts 1995-ish they measure sperm and middle sperm in millions uh Millions per milliliter and the number was about 95 million sperm per milliliter which is is a good number those numbers started to drop and by the time 2021 was the last Global census of of sperm on the planet we&#x27;ve gone from 95 uh the 95 million um per milliliter down to right around 40 and possibly even below 40 million per milliliter and if that number sounds familiar to any of you out there that are trying to conceive if you&#x27;re going to fertility clinics you&#x27;re probably familiar with his number 40 million Border Lines on low sperm count where it&#x27;s difficult to conceive and the indications are we&#x27;re going to continue to drop we&#x27;re dropping below that 40 million and a lot of it is due to environmental toxins our environment is Laden with what are called anti-androgens androgens the sex hormones for both men and women so uh the the toxins including BPA and all the ways that&#x27;s showing up everything from women&#x27;s cosmetics and shampoos and lotions uh to the products that that men are using as well to the way we soften Plastics and the drinking water bottles that we all are accustomed to when we&#x27;re traveling uh and many other places the the Linings inside of cooking utensils that make them less sticky all of these things are contributing to this we now are below the replacement rate 2.1 babies per human woman is what we need to make to just steady the population we have dropped below that with now more people are dying certainly Wars are contributing to this so we&#x27;ve dropped below the replacement rate more people are dying that are being born so right now if we continue like we are right now population tops out at about 10 billion we&#x27;re at 8 billion now tops out about 10 billion in the year 2050 and if something doesn&#x27;t change we&#x27;re on a really I mean it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not a gradual decline it&#x27;s like off the cliff so our species is in trouble right now a lot of people don&#x27;t want to talk about it a lot of people are not aware of it so when it comes to technology this is why this is important because if the thinking is if we make life better for everyone and we keep making more people where does it end you know it&#x27;s going to be crazy and there won&#x27;t be enough to go around that is thinking false thinking based on the false assumptions of obsolete science from another era we&#x27;ve got the technology right now we have the space we have the land we have the water we have the know-how and I identify all this with Statistics and in the video that&#x27;s referenced down below so what would happen on a larger scale is that we would raise the standard of living for the people that are living with us now and when we do that when we free people from survival they&#x27;re not struggling just to get by and if their babies are healthier with greater cognitive abilities and less stress than the babies undergoing in the world right now now we&#x27;re doing is contributing to our information pool to our imagination pool to our Innovation pool because that&#x27;s our nature to create and innovate it&#x27;s hard not to this is what it means to be human we are Innovative by nature and our Innovation is crushed when we are are stuck in survival and when we&#x27;re suffering so my opinion I think we would see a really beautiful world of people who are much happier because they&#x27;ve raised the standard of living crime weights crime rates would drop uh because the discrepancies between the The Haves and the have-nots would be much less pronounced I think we will always have that discrepancy unless we live in a regulated dystopian kind of world where everybody is doled out the same thing and can&#x27;t use more can&#x27;t use less and is highly controlled I don&#x27;t think we want that that steals our freedom and our creativity and our imagination so I believe that by sharing the new technologies and what are we talking about we&#x27;re talking about energy in my opinion the energy that is available to us uh that is the product of the world we live in and I&#x27;m talking about energy on the Planck scale this is the field around us uh this is an energy that has to be made I mean think about this most energy that is made by either burning or destroying something and capturing the energy of the burning or the destroying or the explosion or whatever it is you know your gasoline-powered automobiles those are little tiny explosions that are happening in this the the cylinders driving the Pistons of your car something has to be ignited you know or or burned or something like that clock scale energy doesn&#x27;t have to be that way at all our inner our universe is made of vibratory uh vibratory strings of energy on a very very small scale called the Planck scale and Below after Max Planck and it is possible to harmonize devices with those plonk scales there are physicists that are doing that now the technology exists uh it has been suppressed and that&#x27;s changing uh and even if we don&#x27;t do that I&#x27;ve talked to you about other forms of Base load energy like thorium the element number 90 on the periodic table uh that produces zero greenhouse gases is abundant nearest crust it&#x27;s inexpensive to produce cannot be weaponized like uranium and plutonium can it can&#x27;t melt down like a Fukushima reactor we&#x27;ve had that for 70 years we could use that as a stepping stone there&#x27;s a bridge I&#x27;ve talked about that in other videos that link is down below as well so this is a long answer to short question what would happen on a large scale a large scale we would be healthier we would be happier we would have more freedom for greater creativity for more imagination for more innovation in essence we would have a greater opportunity to dream bigger dreams you know our ancestors have always told us that this world is an illusionary world that we&#x27;re living a dream and when we sleep at night it&#x27;s a Dream Within the dream so if this is a dream everything we create is a part of our dream and if we&#x27;d like a better world we need to dream a higher dream and when we&#x27;re not struggling for survival we feel strong and healthy and happy and we&#x27;re not afraid of our neighbor we&#x27;re not afraid to lock our our doors and and bury ourselves from the outside world because because those people are suffering in ways that we are not sharing the technology would create that kind of a world it would also decentralize the power structures and what that means is that people who are in power and control Elites in power and control right now they would lose that power and control uh and that they are fighting to keep that now what they don&#x27;t know is that they would have more opportunities not for power and control but they would have more opportunities to contribute and in those contributions to create the world that we&#x27;re talking about and they would benefit tremendously without causing the suffering from a world that we are being taught is based in lack and scarcity and competition and conflict we would see business models based upon cooperation and abundance now think about that the business models that we see right now are based on darwinian ideas there&#x27;s not enough to go around so somebody&#x27;s got something somebody else needs and they&#x27;re going to charge as much as they can for that that is an Economy based upon scarcity and lack what would it mean to have an Economy based upon abundance and cooperation where you say you know you&#x27;ve got something that I need and the person that has that says you know I would be so happy to be able to share with you some of this abundance and and you&#x27;ve got some things that I need it&#x27;s almost like Global bartering and I&#x27;ve seen this work in indigenous communities on smaller scales where no money is involved everybody&#x27;s got everything they need if the energy that powers our economy were made uh abundant and if it were made free because it exists in nature it takes technology to capture it certainly and it takes technology to distribute it certainly and there are ways to compensate for that but if we made this kind of energy accessible that means we would have banking for uh almost two billion of the world&#x27;s population that are considered to be unbanked right now they would have financial resources that they&#x27;ve never had before and they would have the sovereignty and the freedom to exercise those financial resources in ways that are responsible with themselves and their families so the benefits just go on and on uh it&#x27;s a good question we&#x27;re in the midst of the the change right now it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to happen we&#x27;re in it the only way out of it is to go through it and we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s on the other end because you and I are creating it so when we think about the world and what is possible if we can think in terms of abundance and cooperation rather than lack and scarcity and if we can think of how can we in our everyday lives make life better for the next person I know it&#x27;s a very different way of thinking I&#x27;ve talked about this in some of our videos for example every time I jump onto the freeway to go down to the airport from my rural community and there are other cars that are on that on-ramp trying to get on the freeway I make it my job to make sure that everyone in front of me gets on safely and and has a safe start on that freeway they may not be thinking about me that way but it&#x27;s my way of helping my brothers and sisters on the road that morning have a good day instead of a bad day and it&#x27;s little things like that that change the way we think about ourselves and our relationship to the world so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to answer that first question the second question kind of ties into this and this is a question from Nicole Nicole thank you for your question she says does changing our perceptions genuinely change what we see in ourselves and others kind of ties into what I just said about jumping onto the freeway how I feel about myself and how I feel about my my brothers and sisters doing doing the same thing what we&#x27;re talking about when we talk about perceptions it&#x27;s the way we&#x27;ve been taught to think about ourselves it&#x27;s called our story many of you have heard in the Live Events I talk about our story extensively because the term story kind of sounds Airy fairy to many people it sounds like a philosophical abstract concept what I want you to know is that you and I live our lives based upon our story our story is the way we&#x27;ve been taught to think about ourselves every problem every moment and every day of Our Lives we solve based upon the way we think about our relationship to the world every relationship that we have ever had in our lives from our friends to our jobs our careers our businesses to our most intimate relationships people we invite into our homes into our lives the people we invite into our bed they are all based upon our perceptions of ourselves our value our sense of value our sense of worth our relationship to the World At Large the way we heal our bodies is based upon our story the way we choose our politics is based upon our story this shows up in elections all the time the policies that we embrace the laws that we enact the societies that we build they&#x27;re all based upon our story so you can see where our story is more than an abstract concept it&#x27;s the foundation of everything I mean there&#x27;s nothing in your life right now that you can identify that is not related to your story and the way you think about yourself so all of a sudden the story is front and center it&#x27;s the foundation of everything so Nicole your question is is right on it&#x27;s a really good one does changing our perception change the way we see ourselves does changing our perception change our story and the answer is absolutely yes and it does it on a number of different levels at the most fundamental level on the the atomic and the molecular level of our bodies what the best science of the modern world is showing us is that the non-physical perceptions that we have our sense of safety and well-being do we feel safe or do we feel threatened in the world those perceptions trigger feelings and emotions in our heart that directly link to and send information to the brain so the brain can send the chemistry into the body that reflects our perception of the world so for feeling threatened in the world our heart will send a signal to brains it says scary world I&#x27;m not safe brain will start producing chemistry to help protect us and give us what we need so we can act quickly if we need to it&#x27;ll higher levels of adrenaline and stress uh hormones like adrenaline and cortisol um and it will shut down other functions in the body like repair and regeneration so that that energy can be placed into the what we perceive we need to make us safe in the world fight or flight there&#x27;s a part of that so it begins on that level these are epigenetic triggers epigenetics is the ability to change the genetic expression uh through factors that are above the genetic level so nutrition diet exercise those are all epigenetic factors we know that the most powerful is our perceptions because it creates the emotion and triggers the chemistry in the body so yes when we change our perceptions of the world we are actually changing uh the the chemistry of our bodies I&#x27;m just thinking right off the top my head uh there&#x27;s a very famous quote Daniel Newberg uh is a neurophysicist and I believe I got his first name right I didn&#x27;t know I was going to say this so I don&#x27;t have in front of me his last name is Newberg and he is a neurophysicist uh a neuroscientist he is a neuroscientist and what he says is that the changing one word in our vocabulary has the ability to up regulate or down regulate a gene uh at the genetic level uh through fear and stress so just just the way we choose to use a single word can change our genetic expression can upregulate for stronger immune response or if we are telling ourselves we live in a scary world that can down regulate make us our immune system takes a hit uh from that because the energy is going somewhere else so we we have those abilities our perceptions the way we think about ourselves it&#x27;s where everything begins it even ties in to the first question that Andy asked because the solutions that we choose to the problems in the world will be based upon our story and the way we think about ourselves another way of saying this is when we change the way we think about ourselves and our relationship to the world those changes will be reflected in the kinds of solutions that we choose so makes a lot of sense I think our biggest challenge rather than imposing a lot of change on the world with us continuing to think the way we&#x27;ve been thinking you know for a century or two and this is where a lot of the struggle comes from because people are saying okay we&#x27;re being forced to change but they&#x27;re still thinking in the old way so the change doesn&#x27;t make any sense however if we fundamentally shift the thinking and the feelings and the perceptions and change our priorities make it a priority to preserve cherished human values like Freedom like innovation like the ability to to have sovereignty in our lives over our own finances over our own bodies those are fundamental values that that are reflected then in the choices that we make of the kinds of technologies that we Embrace so without knowing it possibly what Nicole has just asked is actually the foundation and the key to solving the greatest problems that we face today is a problem of thinking once we shift our let me just give you a perfect example United Nations statistics tell us very clearly that there is no food shortage on planet Earth we have all the food we need to feed every mouth of every woman every man every child everywhere in the face of the Earth we have the food what is missing is the leadership that makes it a priority for that food to get to the places that it&#x27;s needed when it is needed and when I talk about leadership I&#x27;m not talking necessarily about governments or America or Europe or not talking about you know leaders that we&#x27;re seeing in news you and I are leaders it&#x27;s about human priorities when we as a society when we as a civilization choose to make human life to honor the sanctity of human life and what human life really means there&#x27;s a whole conversation it&#x27;s in another video when we really Embrace that what it means to be human uh when we allow for human life to take priority and to take precedence over economics for example then we will begin to make the choices that support and reflect those values and you will see that the food that we have in one place of the world will find its way to the mouths that needed in another place in the world we&#x27;re blessed right now un says at least for 50 years we&#x27;ve got food security barring a Black Swan event and if a comet you know or a meteorite slams into the Earth or there&#x27;s a nuclear war on the horizon God forbid or you know a global pandemic that is so bad that lasts for years and shuts everything I mean those kinds of things could change those statistics but right now we&#x27;ve got all the food we need the food shortages that you see in the starvations are localized because they have not been made it has not been a priority been made a priority to get food into those people so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to answer that question perceptions are everything our thinking is everything and you know this is this is the 40th year I&#x27;ve done this work in one form or another it&#x27;s kind of a mind blower I&#x27;m not sure where those 40 years went and I&#x27;m looking forward to uh to being with you for at least that long if not longer as we go into uh into this this new century but the I think the greatest challenge that we face is to shift the thinking about who we are what is our potential what are our capabilities and what is our relationship to the Earth and what is our relationship to the cosmos once we make those shifts that reflect the Deep truth of what the best science of the modern world is already showing us and the science is telling us we&#x27;re not we&#x27;ve been told we&#x27;re much more than we&#x27;ve been led to believe we&#x27;re not what we&#x27;re teaching our kids in schools uh once we accept what science is telling us we ask science to tell us who we are science is doing a good job a lot of people don&#x27;t want the answers that the science is telling us a lot of scientists won&#x27;t accept the answers that are being revealed such as the fact that evolution is not the reason that we are here evolution is a fact in the geologic record as a geologist I&#x27;ve seen it plants animals insects it breaks down when it comes to humans we showed up 200 000 years ago through mysterious mutations that happened pretty much all at the same time not slowly gradually over a long period of time and they&#x27;re not the product of Natural Evolution scientific papers tell us that now they don&#x27;t know what to do with it so they don&#x27;t want to teach it so once we embrace the story that the evidence leads to rather than taking the evidence and trying to force it into a pre-existing story that no longer works once we make that shift then the thinking will become the foundation that leads to all the things that we&#x27;re talking about here and solves these problems it all begins with with perceptions so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to answer that question I want to thank you for sharing a part of your day with me today I hope this has been useful as always I appreciate uh click a like if you like it click a don&#x27;t like if you don&#x27;t like it because we don&#x27;t all agree on everything but I&#x27;d like to know that you&#x27;re watching uh feel free to drop me a comment and um I look forward to our next</p>
