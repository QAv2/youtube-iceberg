            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational channel uh focused on uh the esoteric and obscure uh things that uh I think are very important for people to know to learn about and today is uh I think the 182nd video on the reciprocal system of theory and this is a theory of everything or a system of theory that was devised by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century up until his death in 1990 the general idea is that Larson&#x27;s universe is a universe of motion not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion and motion as the relationship between space and time which sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time space and time don&#x27;t actually exist they only exist together in motion um an easy example is speed speed the car is going 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in one hour of time you double the speed and you&#x27;re going 20 miles an hour 20 miles of space in one hour of time or you could also say you&#x27;re going 10 miles in half an hour so that shows you that there is a reciprocal relationship in speed between space and time but speed is not the only um relationship between space and time all motions which are really all um scientific quantities are relationships between space and time but it is a bit more complicated because space and time have their coordinate aspects meaning that they are three or more Dimensions XYZ coordinates of space we are familiar with that XYZ and but also Time Has Its coordinate aspects so time has three or more Dimensions as well in addition to that time and space both have their scalar or clock aspects meaning that they possess a kind of motion that has a direct has a magnitude but has no particular direction just like if you took um put a bunch of dots on a balloon and you blew up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but in no particular direction this is what Larson calls clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction and clock space everything in the universe is getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction and this motion at the speed of light is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system this is basically the um ether or the origin or the midpoint of this universe and you can see that in what Larson calls the discrete unit postulate there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time and if you have one exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light so the speed of light is one and then everything above one is half the universe called The Cosmic sector and everything below one is the material sector the other half of the universe um the material sector is really the only sector that the Legacy scientists know anything about the cosmic sector is uh this is shown by Einstein&#x27;s dicta that said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in the cosmic sector the speed of light is actually the minimum speed of the universe everything in that universe is moving faster than the speed of light we don&#x27;t exactly have a firm grasp of that but since we understand the material sector we can extrapolate because what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector is exactly what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that the roles of space and time are reversed so you know in the material sector we have uh primarily relationships uh that are in space um and uh in the cosmic sector they&#x27;re primarily uh in well we won&#x27;t say that because space and time are not really the container of the universe they are really the contents of the universe and you can you can um abstract you can take an abstract picture uh snapshot of uh of a part of the universe and say that something is in space or in time but really space and time represent the contents of the universe now what Larson basically did is he developed this universe step by step through induction until he was ready to understand the basic principles and then he put out his fundamental postulates two very short postulates one of them is basically the universe is made out of motion emotion is the relationship between space and time space and time have their coordinate aspects and they have their uh scalar aspects and they come in discrete units and the other postulate is the universe adheres to the you know basic quantities of absolute mathematics it&#x27;s this magnitudes are absolute as geometries euclidean that&#x27;s just a paraphrase of it but um so then once he had those postulates then he went on a process of deduction if this then that and he derived an entire theoretical Universe of what his Universe would look like in theory and then eventually he compared that Universe to the actual universe that the scientists had been measuring exploring and measuring and quantifying and um you know he basically identified different things within his Universe with uh things uh within the um Legacy scientists universe and mostly 90 percent of uh the things that uh the scientists had discovered fit in seamlessly in his system and then the 10 percent that didn&#x27;t were generally on the margins of the the very fast the very small the very large and it gets the very slow um just the relativistic stuff and so he basically provides a a an alternative to the relativistic stuff and that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s got a book that&#x27;s called Beyond Newton his his uh his launching Point basically uh the the Newtonian Universe basically fits in to Larson&#x27;s system but the einsteinian universe does not uh that&#x27;s a simplification but uh it&#x27;s a basic idea okay now we&#x27;re looking at his um 1979 book called Nothing But motion and we&#x27;re in chapter uh chapter 11 of this book uh that&#x27;s called subatomic particles and we&#x27;re taking over right in the middle of the chapter he&#x27;s discussing uh He was discussing the photon and I mean the proton and the neutrino and uh we&#x27;ll let him go from here in the previous Publications the m one half dash one half Dash zero combination was identified as the neutron but it was noted that in some physical processes such as cosmic ray decay the magnetic displacement that could be expected to be ejected in the form of neutrons is actually transferred in massless form since the observed Neutron is a particle of unit atomic weight it was at that time concluded that in these particular instances the neutrons act as combinations of neutron neutrinos and positrons both massless particles on this basis the neutron plays a dual role massless under some conditions but possessing unit mass under other circumstances further investigations centering mainly on the secondary mass of the subatomic particles which will be discussed in Chapter 13 has now disclosed that the observed Neutron is not the single effective magnetic rotation with displacements M one-half one-half one-half dash one half Dash zero but a more complex particle of the same net displacement and that the single magnetic displacement is massless it is no longer necessary to conclude that the same particle acts in two different ways instead there are two different particles so he&#x27;s basically making a distinction between his massless Neutron one half dash one half Dash zero and the um compound what he calls the compound Neutron which I guess he&#x27;ll be introducing later the explanation is that the new findings have revealed the existence of a type of structure intermediate between the single rotating systems of the massless particles and the complete double systems of the atoms in these intermediate structures there are two rotating systems as in the atoms of the elements but only one of these systems has a net effective displacement the rotation in this system is that of the proton m1-1 in the second system there is a neutrino type rotation the massless rotations of the second system can be either those of the material neutrino m one half Dash one-half that&#x27;s negative one or those of the cosmic neutrino which is um on a cosmic rotational base one half one half dash one uh uh I don&#x27;t quite get that I would think that that would be negative one but be that as it may with the material neutrino rotation the com the combined displacements are m one half dash one half Dash negative two this combination is the mass one isotope of hydrogen a structure identical with that of the normal Mass 2 atom uh which is deuterium m 2 Dash 2 Dash negative two or M 2-1 Dash negative one in the atomic notation except that uh except that it has one less unit of magnetic rotation and therefore one less unit of mass when the cosmic neutrino rotation is added to the proton the combined displacements are two m 2-2-0 now remember when you put the M or the C in front of these that is indicating a sub a subatomic particle and using the subatomic particle notation which is different than the atomic notation um because it&#x27;s counting more of the rotations the same net total as that of the single magnetic rotation so M 2-2-0 he says the same net total as that of the single magnetic rotation this theoretical particle the compound neutron as we will call it can be identified as The observed Neutron um he&#x27;s gotten pretty far into the weeds here with this uh notation and the system but we will continue the identification of the separate rotations of these intermediate type structures with the rotations of the neutrinos and protons should not be interpreted as meaning that neutrinos and protons actually exist as such in the combination structures what is meant is that one of the component rotations that constitutes the compound Neutron for instance is the same kind of a rotation as that which constitutes a proton when it exists separately inasmuch as the net total displacement of the compound Neutron is identical with that of the massless neutron those aspects of the behavior of the particles properties as they are called which are dependent on the net total displacement are the same for both likewise those properties that are dependent on total magnetic displacement or Total Electric displacement are identical but there are other properties that are related to those features of the particle structure in which the two neutrons differ the compound neutron has an effective unit of three-dimensional displacement in the rotating system with the proton type rotation and it therefore has one unit of mass the massless neutron on the other hand has no effective three-dimensional displacement and therefore no Mass the two neutrons also differ in that although it is um a still unobserved particle the massless neutron is theoretically stable in the material environment whereas the life of the compound Neutron is short because of the foreign nature of the rotation in the second system after about after about 15 minutes on the average the compound Neutron ejects the second rotating system in the form of a cosmic neutrino and the particle reverts to proton status and so that makes you very much question uh as the Legacy scientists have not done how the neutron can be a one of the building blocks of an atom if it&#x27;s only stable for 15 minutes and it uh it decays into a proton but that&#x27;s one of only a number of uh you know anomalies within the structure of the nuclear atom okay uh and Larson gets around that because he says that there is no nucleus of an atom an atom is just one thing and it&#x27;s a combination of different kinds of motions but it&#x27;s one motion uh one thing just like a curveball which is a also a combination of motions but it&#x27;s one thing the structures of the subatomic particles of the material system may now be summarized as follows Okay so the massless particles include the 0-0-0 rotational base this is all on the on the material um I I don&#x27;t know what the term there would be the material uh I guess that would be the material rotational base and so 0-0-0 is the rotational base and then m uh 0-0-1 is the positron m 0-0-negative one is the electron m one half one half one half dash one half Dash zero is the massless neutron and M one half dash one half Dash negative one is the neutrino uh with particles with mass we have M plus which means charged uh even though he hasn&#x27;t gone over that at all yet uh 0-0-1 is the charged positron so it&#x27;s the same notation as the positron but it&#x27;s m Plus instead of just m minus the charged electron is zero Dash zero Dash negative one on an M minus rotational base the charge electron then we have the proton m1-1 and then we have the charged proton M plus one dash one dash negative one and then we have the compound Neutron which is um two uh one on a material cause uh rotational base and one on a cosmic rotational base the com pound uh or the the so on M we have one dash one that&#x27;s negative one and on C we have negative one half negative one-half one and those two combine together it adds up to one half dash one half Dash zero the same as the massless neutron but it&#x27;s using both of those compound both of those uh rotational bases so it&#x27;s a compound Neutron all right well that is the end of that chapter and uh you know don&#x27;t get discouraged if you&#x27;re not following along I&#x27;m I&#x27;m struggling uh mightily here to follow along uh with these different kinds of notations and uh you know kind of the uh derivations um but uh just hear him out that&#x27;s the general idea you hear him out let him say what he has to say and then you can let it percolate in your your head for a while and you know take what you need and discard the rest um and so we will be going into chapter 12 tomorrow basic mathematical relations uh till then have a great day thanks for tuning in</p>
