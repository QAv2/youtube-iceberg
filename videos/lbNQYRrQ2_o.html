            <p>lately I have been uh listening to a lot of UFO stuff okay a lot of UFO Abduction stories a lot of UFO I&#x27;m go going through jacqu vet&#x27;s stuff because he&#x27;s coming on the podcast again and so I&#x27;ve been going through all of his books he&#x27;s got several books and he&#x27;s got a very nuanced perspective on this whole UFO thing that is uh I didn&#x27;t know and I wish I knew the first time I had him on because the first time I had him on I knew that he was the guy who was uh in he inspired the French scientist in the Steven Spielberg movie Clos Encounters of the Third Kind okay did you see that movie I did see it you remember theen SCI this is 1977 right yes so there&#x27;s a French scientist in that film that is uh coordinating all these uh people that are trying to contact this UFO and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re working this out like how to do it it&#x27;s based on jacqu Val and jacqu Val has been involved in the research of these experiences that people had had or allegedly had with being abducted with sightings with crash sites and all these different things he&#x27;s been involved with it for a long time where are you on the Zero I absolutely don&#x27;t believe any of this 100 I fully believe in this what&#x27;s your score I the more time goes on the more I think it&#x27;s way weirder than we think I I don&#x27;t dismiss the idea that something from another planet can come here and visit us I have have a feeling it&#x27;s weirder I have a feeling there may be that and then also other things I have a feeling it&#x27;s way more complicated I have a feeling it&#x27;s like life like if you told me that if you go to Earth you can find life okay well what kind of Life are you talking about you talking about like fish are you talking about Raptors are you talking about dogs like what kind of life there&#x27;s so much life there&#x27;s so much different life I have a feeling that alien contact intelligent being from somewhere other than here is like that I think it&#x27;s probably more complex than we can imagine and probably there&#x27;s an interdimensional aspect to it there&#x27;s probably a non-physical aspect to it that seems physical too there&#x27;s probably an area of this phenomenon that plays on human consciousness and dreams and our interactions with the unknown because I think there&#x27;s more to life than we can perceive I think there&#x27;s more to the existence this this this conscious existence in this moment in the universe there&#x27;s more to it than we&#x27;re picking up on I think we have limited senses and I think that this is what things like the telepathy tapes and all these different people that are studying paranormal phenomenon I think that&#x27;s what this stuff is all about I think it&#x27;s part of an emerging aspect of human consciousness that we&#x27;re developing stronger and stronger senses in regards to things that aren&#x27;t they&#x27;re not something that you just put on a scale they&#x27;re not something that you could take a rule or two they&#x27;re not something that you can quantify but they probably exist</p>
