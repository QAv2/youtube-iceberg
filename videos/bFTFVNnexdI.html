            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel um this channel is for educational purposes and uh today is our 491st video that we&#x27;ve done on Dewey B Larson in his reciprocal system of theory and uh this is a system of theory meaning that it is a generalized Theory uh you can learn its BAS basic ins and outs and once you do that you can apply it to any subject that you want so it&#x27;s uh um a glorious Theory of Everything um that is difficult to learn but it&#x27;s way worth it um and you know Mr Larsson may maybe made a few mistakes along the way um some of those things are being cleaned up as we speak or have been cleaned up um but the future is bright I believe for the reciprocal system um and um I believe this is the only channel uh that I can find on the internet that is going into it very deeply uh almost 500 videos now if you want to get the kind of the 20 minute uh somewhat uh halfway thorough uh explanation of the reciprocal system you don&#x27;t to watch any uh any of my first 400 74 videos on this subject where I go into the reciprocal system in a little bit of detail at least kind of give you the ins and outs of it but um I guess from here on in I&#x27;m going to more or less assume that you have some kind of working knowledge of the reciprocal system because uh what we&#x27;re doing here is basically reading um Larson&#x27;s books and uh today we&#x27;re reading from uh and for the last month or so our more we&#x27;ve been reading from his uh 1987 book um basic properties of matter which is on chemistry but again it&#x27;s on chemistry but if you learn how he does it with chemistry then you can you know apply analogously to other subjects um you know he uses the same rules for chemistry that he uses for astronomy that he uses for metaphysics that he uses for economics I mean it&#x27;s not exactly the same but you plug it in like in an analogous way uh larsson&#x27;s uh uh so Larson um he lived uh from 1898 to 1990 and 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operated and then he derived a theoretical Universe from that those two postulates basically what my universe would look like if my postulates were correct and then he Compares his theoretical Universe with the universe that was measured um in the laboratory and compiled in in Tables by uh armies of um Legacy scientists uh and basically larsson&#x27;s reciprocal system is also known as uh Universe of motion it&#x27;s one of the few scientists to propose motion as the fundamental thing in the universe not matter not energy not forces but motions and uh everything is made out of motion uh in particular what he calls a scalar motion scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction uh that&#x27;s about as far as I&#x27;m going to go uh if you want more detail you can go into uh any of my first 474 videos on this subject but from now we&#x27;re going to go uh into uh we&#x27;re right in the middle of chapter 14 of basic properties of matter which is on um the basic forces so here he is talking about the forces you know gravitation electricity magnetism and that they are not uh or you know the SM the uh the uh weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force which are basically completely made up and um uh these are not fundamental they are just just simply kinds of motion and so lson gets into that here um and we went through the first uh uh first um section of this chapter yesterday and I apologize about yesterday I was uh so sleepy I think I might have actually fallen asleep a couple times during the video it&#x27;s hard to tell when you&#x27;re nodding off like that where if you&#x27;re not as if are you as was I asleep for like two seconds or was I asleep for like 2 minutes so I don&#x27;t know if uh if there were like l i didn&#x27;t go back and watch it cuz I was just trying to get it out at the time so anyway uh I&#x27;m I&#x27;m quite a bit more alert tonight so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to stay awake okay we&#x27;re going to start right here uh there is no reason to be apologetic about these few errors and omissions Larson is just referring to some things that he didn&#x27;t get right in his first edition of this uh pie three volume uh structure of the physical universe that he put out in 1959 and he&#x27;s saying that now after 28 more years I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve learned a few more things so present day physical theory has been in the process of development for centuries during which a myriad of conclusions that have been reached with respect to details of the theory or theories have subsequently had to be abandoned as incorrect in comparison with this experience the error rate in the development of the theory of the universe of motion is fantastically low this is no accident in as much as all conclusions in all areas are derived deductively from the same set of basic premises consistency of the interrelations between phenomena the basic requirement for conceptual validity is achieved automatically those cases in which the developers of the theory are having some trouble merely emphasize the easy and natural way in which solutions for most of the previously unsolved fundamental problems of physical science have emerged from the theoretical development the review of the gravitational situation that was recently undertaken was a able to take advantage of some very significant advances that have been made in our understanding of the details of the universe of motion that is in the consequences of the postulates in the years that have elapsed since publication of volume 1 in 1979 that&#x27;s uh his book nothing but motion uh which is mainly on uh like Atomic physics some organic chemistry and uh that&#x27;s the first volume volum of his three volume set the structure of the physical Universe this is the second volume even though it came out third um basic properties of matter primarily on chemistry and then its third volume is called Universe of motion uh which came out in 1984 and that is on astronomy Chief among these is the clarification of the nature and properties of scalar motion discussed in chapter 12 and covered in more detail in the 1982 book neglected facts of science the Improvement in understanding of this type of motion has thrown a great deal of new light on the force relations it is now clear that the differences between the basic types of forces that were recognized from the start of the investigation as dimensional in nature are differences in the number of scalar Dimensions involved rather than geometric dimensions of space so he&#x27;s making a distinction between scalar dimensions and vectorial dimensions or dimensions of space uh dimensions of time um and then um scalar Dimensions you can um or dimensions of motion so you can have three dimensions of space but you only need one dimension of motion to um exhaust three dimensions of space and so the reference system doesn&#x27;t uh you know doesn&#x27;t um isn&#x27;t adequate to describe three dimensions of motion so um you know though that points out some of the limitations of the the stationary spatial reference system and uh you know that one of the reasons that Larson uses the moving reference system that he calls the natural reference system okay the uh this provides simple explanations for several of the issues that had been matters of concern in the earlier stages of the theoretical development the significant conceptual change here is in the nature of the relation between motion and its representation in the reference system in previous physical thought motion was regarded as a change of position in a specifically defined physical space uh in for Newton and or space time for Einstein during a specific physical time this physical space and time thus constitute a background or container changes of position due to motion relative to the spatial background are assumed to be capable of representation by vectors in the theory of the universe of motion on the other hand space and time have physical existence only as the reciprocally related components of motion and the threedimensional space of our ordinary EXP experience is merely a reference system not a physical container furthermore the development of the details of the theory in the preceding pages of this and the earlier volume shows that the spacio temporal reference system which combines the three-dimensional spatial frame of reference with the time magnitudes registered on a clock is incapable of representing the full range of existing motions some motions cannot be represented in their true character others cannot be represented in this reference system at all the deficiency of the reference system with which we are particularly concerned at this time is its inability to represent multi-dimensional scalar motion this inability of the reference system to represent more than one scalar mo one scalar dimension of motion explains why the forces exerted by charges and masses are all onedimensional irrespective of the number of scalar Dimensions applicable to the inherent motion of the charges the charge or mass only one of these scalar Dimensions is coincident with the dimension of the reference system and the motion in this Dimension is therefore the only one that can be represented in the reference system as indicated earlier this limitation on the capability of the reference system is the reason for the great disparity in magnitude between the basic forces the total magnitudes of the electric and gravitational forces are actually the same but only the motion in the dimension of the reference system is affected in our gravitationally bound system the dimensional ratio in CGS units is 3 * 10 10th thus the electric force which is one-dimensional and therefore fully effective is relatively strong the gravitational force actually has the same total strength but is distributed over three scalar Dimensions only one of which coincides with the dimensions of the reference system the effective gravitational force is therefore weaker by the effective electrostatic force uh weaker than the effective electrostatic force by a factor of uh 9 * 10 20th or the square of 3 * 10 10 it should be noted however that the difference in the number of effective scalar Dimensions has this effect on the relative magnitude of the force only because it is applied to the very large value of the unit of speed the relation between the sizes of the units in which we measure space and time this in turn is a consequence of our position in a gravitationally bound system that is moving inward in space at a high speed opposing the spatial component of the outward progression of the natural reference system the net motion of the gravitating system in space is relatively small while the motion in time proceeds at the full speed of the progression question thus we experience a small change in space coincidentally with a very large change in time ah uh it seems to me that it would be the opposite but um I&#x27;ll just uh try to figure that out for myself okay keep going we assign values to the units of these quantities that reflect the manner in which we experience them and on this basis we have defined a unit of time in the CGS system that is 3 * 10 10th times as large as our unit of space our unit of speed is then 3 * 10 10 space units per unit of time that&#x27;s in centimeters and seconds as can and those are in CGS system Larsson has a different system but um you know oh he plugs it in he&#x27;s he&#x27;s going with the CGS system for the purposes of this illustration as can be seen from the foregoing the magnitude that we assign to the unit of speed the speed of light customarily represented by the symbol C is not an inherent property of the universe although the magnitude of the speed itself is the general range within which this value will fall is determined by our position in a system of gravitating objects and the specific value Within These limits is assigned arbitrarily any change in the unit of either space or time that is not counterbalanced by an equivalent change in the other Alters the value of C in our measurement system and the relation between the magnitudes of the electric and gravitational Forces c^ 2 is is changed accordingly the electric force is usually asserted to be 10 39 or 10 40th times as strong as the gravitational force but this figure is based on a set of erroneous assumptions that uh Larsson doesn&#x27;t go into so I I haven&#x27;t seen him go into that in uh in another work but perhaps he does the further clarification of the mutual nature of scalar motion accomplished in the most recent studies has also thrown a very significant additional light on the force situation as brought out in chapter 12 it is now evident that a scalar motion AB cannot be distinguished in the absence of a fixed coupling to the reference system from a scalar motion ba this means that in considering the mutual gravitational motion of two masses we are dealing with only one motion the representation of which is the reference system in the which in the reference system depends on external factors on this basis the expression m m Prime in the gravitational equation is not a product of two masses but the product of one mass and the number of mass the number of units of mass in the interacting object likewise the distance term s s is a pure number the ratio of s s units to one square unit thus the only dimensional quantity that appears in the equation aside from the resultant force is one of the mass terms this result of the current study confirms the original finding reported in the 1959 publication it likewise confirms the earlier finding that another dimensional term a unit of acceleration must be inserted into the equation to produce a dimensional balance force in general is the product of mass and acceleration it follows that the progression for any particular Force must reduce to FAL ma when all dimensions are properly assigned the existence of the acceleration term is not apparent without a theoretical analysis because the gravitational acceleration is unity and therefore has no effect on the numerical results the difficulties that have been previously experienced in applying the principle of the equivalence of natural units to the gravitational equation are now seen to have been due to an inadequate understanding of the manner in which the dimensionless terms in the equation should be treated when the statement of the unit equivalence is formulated we now recognize that these terms vanish if they are given unit value in the system of measurement in which the values of the dimension terms are stated unless some structural factor is specifically applicable however the use of an arbitrary mass unit in the conventional measurement systems introduce a complication as it means that two different systems of units are actually being used as we saw in the discussion of physical fundamentals in volume one all physical quantities including Mass can be expressed in terms of units of space and time only it follows that when an arbitrary unit is used for the measurement of mass we are expressing the mass and the acceleration in different measurement systems this is equivalent to introducing a numerical factor into whatever physical relations may be involved the ratio between units uh I&#x27;m sorry the ratio between the sizes of the respective units introduction of this Factor does not affect the numerical balance of an equation as long as both sides of the equation contain the same number of mass terms but in the gravitational equation f equals uh K mm Prime over d squared there are two Mass terms on one side of the equation while the force the lone term on the other side contains only one Mass term FAL ma in order to balance the equation numerically a correction factor must be applied to convert the extra mass term to the units applicable to space and time the ratio of the natural uh SpaceTime unit of mass to the arbitrary mass unit is the required correction factor together with whatever structural factors are applicable to the equation it constitutes the gravitational constant the ratio of the natural unit of mass in the CGS system to the arbitrary unit the gram was evaluated in volume 1 as 2.23 6055 * 10us um 8 it was also noted in that earlier volume that the factor three evidently res representing a uh the number of effective Dimensions enters into the relation between the gravitational constant and the natural unit of mass gravitational constant is there for three times that uh other number and that equals uh 6.78 165 * 10us 8 with a small adjustment that will be considered shortly to apply the principle of equivalence of natural units to the gravitational equation the dimensionless quantities m m Prime and D to the 2 power are given unit value in terms of the conventional measurement systems so that they vanish from the equation the dimensional terms the mass term M and the acceleration term inserted into the equation are then stated in the appropriate natural units uh 1. 6197 * 10- 24 G and 1.9 971 uh um time 10 the 26 cm/s squared respectively the natural unit of force derived from these values is 3272 * 10 the 2 di the values thus derive exceed the measure the measured gravitational constant and the previously determined value of unit Force by the factor of 1.005 to4 it is unlikely that there is an error of this magnitude in the measurements it seems evident that there is another quite small structural factor involved in the gravitational relation this is not at all surprising as we have found in the earlier studies in other areas that the primary Mass values entering into physical relations are often subject to modification because of secondary Mass effects the ratio of the unit of secondary Mass to the unit of primary mass is 1.639 which is the um 1 plus the inter Regional ratio the remaining uncertainty in the gravitational values is thus within the range of the secondary Mass effects and will probably be accounted for when a comprehensive study of the secondary Mass Mass situation is carried out a rather ironic result of the new findings with respect to the gravitational constant as described in the forging paragraphs is that they have taken us back almost to where we were in in 1959 the repudiation of the 1959 result in the 1979 publication as a consequence of the criticism leveled against it is now SE to have been a mistake in the light of the additional information now available it appears that the shortcoming of the original results was not that they were wrong but that they were incomplete and not adequately supported with explanations and confirmatory uh evidence and were therefore vulnerable to attack the more recent work has provided the support that was originally lacking okay um I&#x27;m just kind of trying to see where we&#x27;re at here um yeah I&#x27;m not going to finish this chapter today I think this might be a pretty good place to stop um Larson uh is you know getting kind of dry here and he&#x27;s just kind of going over these uh units and and um it&#x27;s probably you know not a good place to start if you are just starting with the reciprocal system again I would just urge you to go back into um any of my first 474 videos and look at the um and listen to the uh kind of the summary of the reciprocal system but just recall you know a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but no specific direction and you can Model A scal SC motion using a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other but they won&#x27;t be moving in any particular direction they&#x27;ll be moving in all directions every dot will be moving away from every other dot just in the outward Direction you can also reverse the balloon and um that will be an inward motion uh those motions are analogous to what Larson calls the progression the outward movement and gravity ation as the inward movement and uh all really all manifestation is a matter of kind of converting that outward motion of the progression into um Mass which is inherently gravitational and so um that&#x27;s kind of the the basic idea but then uh Larsson isn&#x27;t here kind of like uh uh chopping it up with all the uh different units and and um this is probably more advanced than you want to really get into uh I say that because it&#x27;s probably more advanced than I want to get into um I I understand these these these basic units but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a little bit uh at a loss where why he&#x27;s like trying to convert from uh CGS units than to uh natural units and why he&#x27;s able to to uh more or less uh I got kind of lost here at the 10 uh 10 the 20th Factor um and then but the real factor is 10 to the 39th or 40th uh for the ratio between the electric force and the gravitational force but he doesn&#x27;t really explain that so um this uh section so far is kind of um created more questions that it&#x27;s answered for me but uh that&#x27;s kind of how it goes when you study the reciprocal system you&#x27;re not going to get all the answers wrapped up in a bow for you because instead of having an army of thousands of scientists working on this over the course of centuries and uh putting in trillions of dollars of research money you have one guy with a slide rule um and no budget uh trying to compete with them and actually winning uh in many cases but he doesn&#x27;t always answer all your questions uh right when you want to the answers uh so a lot of times he answers your questions in a different chapter in a different passage or whatever and so you just kind of have to pick up a breadcrumb at a time and store them up in your mind and then when you get the answer later on it&#x27;ll ring a bell okay uh we&#x27;re going to stop right there and get get into the rest of this chapter finish this chapter tomorrow and then move on so uh thanks for tuning in for today and have a great</p>
