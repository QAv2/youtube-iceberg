            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we try to look at different theories of everything and go into them deeply and uh you know dig out what we can use and how we can use it and um you know uh working on our own Paradigm shifting and uh uh Awakening to 5D Consciousness today is our 485th video uh that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and uh Mr Larson was a an engineer American engineer um uh working out of Portland primarily uh born in North Dakota in 1898 uh in 19 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how the universe operated and then in the final 30 years of his life he um Turned that uh elaborated that fundament those two fundamental postulates into a theoretical Universe um and he wrote uh some books uh that he uh where he compared his theoretical Universe with the empirical uh universe that was uh measured and compiled by Legacy scientists to see kind of how how he did or you know whether his theoretical Universe matched up with the so-called actual universe and uh one of those studies here is right here uh that we&#x27;re working on today uh it is a book called basic properties of matter that he wrote in put out in 1987 and uh we&#x27;re uh in the middle of chapter 11 Thermo Electric properties now if you want to get a more detailed description of the reciprocal system uh please watch one of my first 474 videos on this topic I&#x27;ve recently just stopped uh going over it cuz I I really want to get into the text a little bit more and it really takes like 20 minutes uh minimum to uh kind of sum up the reciprocal system uh to the point where you know a new listener can uh kind of follow along with the text so uh go and look at one of those videos and then you come back and and uh then you&#x27;ll be prepared to go through now you can just wing it and give it a try see what you can pick up I&#x27;ll just tell you that um the reciprocal system is also known as the universe of motion and Larsson was uh one of the few scientists to propose motion as the sole constituent of the universe not matter or energy but motion is the most fundamental thing and uh Larson first postulate where uh his original ideas are um you know encapsulated is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time motion is a fraction with space or time is the numerator time or space is the denominator um with the caveat that motion space and time come in three dimensions and um they also come in only discrete units and uh when he&#x27;s talking about motion he&#x27;s referring specifically to a kind of motion that is actually more General he calls a scalar motion a scalar motion is a a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction which you can Envision using a balloon and put dots on it with a magic marker if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be be moving away from each other but they won&#x27;t be moving in any specific Direction in fact they&#x27;ll be moving in every direction that is a scalar motion every direction outward so every dot will be moving away from every other dot that is the uh that outward motion of the balloon is what LaRon calls the progression and this progression is really the source of all manifestation in the universe so manifestation really occurs by taking that outward motion and reversing it and kind of reeling it in and harnessing it and that is really how you get matter basically turning that outward motion of the balloon to an inward motion of the balloon where all of the dots will be moving toward each other that&#x27;s what he calls gravity and um okay now we are in again just watch one of my first 474 videos If you want to get a little bit more complete description and uh we&#x27;re going to get into talking here about U uh thermoelectric properties he just gave us an equation here for thermal conductivity uh K Over CP it&#x27;s thermal conductivity uh I believe the K is a constant um and um I believe the P is for pressure and I&#x27;m trying to remember what the C is um conductivity uh it is something I think it&#x27;s a coefficient of conductivity or something to that effect um I&#x27;m sure that Larsson will clear this up as as we move along so let&#x27;s just keep going as we saw in the earlier chapters the specific heat of the conductor materials follows a straight line relation to the temperature in the upper portion of the temperature range of the solid state and the resistance is linearly related to the temperature at all points at these higher temperatures therefore there is a constant relation between the thermal conductivity and the electrical conductivity uh which is the reciprocal of the resistivity this relation is known as the weedim and Fran law the relation expressed in this law breaks down at the lower temperatures as soon as the specific heat drops below the original straight line however the failure of the relation does not occur as soon as would be expected from the normal specific Heats of the metals most of which begin to drop away from the upper linear segment of the curve in the neighborhood of room temperature the reason for the extension of the high temperature linear relation to a lower temperature in application to ther to Thermal conductivity is that the specific heat under the conditions applicable to thermal conduction is not subject subject to all of the limitations that apply to the transmission of thermal energy by contact between atoms of matter instead of going through some intermediate steps as in the measured specific heats the effective specific heat in thermal conduction continues on the the high temperature basis down to the point where multi-unit motion is no longer possible and a transition to a single unit basis is mandatory the temperature designated as T Sub Zero in the previous discussion the point at which the specific heat curve reaches the zero level is the same in thermal conduction as in the atomic contacts but in the interaction between the electrons and the atoms the single rotating system of electron of the electron adds 1/2 unit to the one unit initial level of the double system of the atom the initial level of the modified specific heat curve is therefore 1 and 1/2 units instead of the usual one unit this makes the shape of the curve somewhat steeper than that of the initial segment of the normal specific heat curve defined in chapter 5 the deviation of the thermal conductivity from the constant relation expressed by the Weedman Fran&#x27;s law is the problem with which any theory of thermal conductivity has to deal and since the explanation derived from the reciprocal system of theory attributes this deviation to the specific heat pattern the best way to demonstrate the validity of the explanation appears to be to work backward from the measured thermal conductivities calculate the corresponding theoretical specific Heats from equation 111 and then compare these calculated specific Heats with the theoretical pattern just described okay then he shows a figure that I don&#x27;t have access to but uh figure 17 is a comparison of this kind for the element copper for which the numerical coefficient of equation uh 11 uh-1 is 24.0 uh that&#x27;s the K Over CP uh equation where thermal conduct activities are expressed in Watts uh watt Cent Watts uh per square cm per degree the solid lines in this diagram represent the specific heat curve applicable to the thermal conductivity of copper as defined in the preceding discussion for comparison the first segment of the normal specific heat curve of this element is shown as a dashed line as in the illustrations of specific Curves in the preceding chapters the high temperature extension of the upper segment of the curve uh is omitted in order to make it possible to show the significant features of the curve more clearly as a diagram indicates the specific Heats calculated from the measured thermal conductivities follow the theoretical Lines within the range of the probable experimental errors except uh at the lower and upper ends of the first segment where transition curves of the usual kind reflect the deviation of the specific heat of the aggregate from that of the individual atoms similar data for lead and aluminum are presented also here in figure 18 the pattern followed by the three elements thus far considered may be regarded as the regular Behavior the one to which the largest number of elements can form no fullscale investigation of the deviations from this basic pattern has yet been undertaken but an idea of the nature of these deviations can be gained from an examination of the effective specific heat of uh chromium which uh is also here in uh figure 19 which I also don&#x27;t have access to here the specific heat and temperature values in the low temperature range have only half the usual magnitude the negative initial specific heat is -1.0 rather than -2.0 the temperature of zero specific heat is 16° Kelvin rather than 32° Kelvin and the initial level of the upper segment of the curve is 2.62 instead of 5.23 this but this upper segment of the modified curve intersects the upper segment of the normal curve at the Neal Point uh 311k and above this temperature the effective specific heat of chromium in thermal conductivity follows the regular specific heat pattern uh defined in chapter 5 another kind of deviation from the regular pattern is seen in the curve for antimony antimony I&#x27;m not sure uh also shown in figure 19 here the initial level of the first segment is zero instead of the usual negative level the initial level of the second segment is the half siiz value 2.62 uh and timy thus combines the two types of deviation that have been mentioned as indicated earlier it has been it has not been yet determined whether any factors other than the resistivity coefficient enter into the constant K of equation 111 resolution of this issue is Complicated by the wide margin of uncertainty in the thermal conductivity measurements the authors of the compilation from which the data used in this work were taken estimate that these values are correct only to within 5 to 10% of the greater part of the temperature range with some uncertainties as high as 15% however the agreement between the plotted points in the figures and the corresponding theoretical curves AB uh shows that most of the data represented in these diagrams are more accurate than the for going estimates would indicate except for the aluminum values in the range from 200 to 300K in any event we find that for the majority of the elements included in our preliminary examination the product of the empirical value of the factor K in equation 111 and the temperature coefficient of resistivity is between 0.14 and 0.18 included are the best known and most thoroughly studied elements copper iron aluminum silver Etc and a large and a range of K values extending all the way from 25.8 in silver to 1.1 in antim this rather strongly suggests that when all of the disturbing influences such as impurity effects are removed the empirical Factor K in equation 111 can be replaced by a purely theoretical value k/ R in which a theoretically derived conversion con constant K in the neighborhood of um 0.15 watts per square cm per degree is divided by a theoretically derived coefficient of resistivity the impurity effects that account for much of the uncertainty in the general run of thermal conductivity measurements are still more prominent at very low temperatures at least on first consideration the theoretical development appears to indicate that the thermal conductivity should follow the same kind of a probability curve in the region just above zero temperature as the properties discussed in the preceding chapters in many cases however the measurements show a minimum of in the conductivity at some very low temperature with a rising Trend below this level on the other hand some of the elements that are available in an extremely pure State show little or no effect of this kind and follow curves similar to those encountered in the same temperature range during the study of other properties it is not unlikely that this will prove to be the general rule when more specimens are available in a pure enough state it should be noted that an ordinary High degree of Purity is not enough as the data compilers point out the thermal conductivities in this very low temperature region are highly sensitive to small physical and chemical variations of the SP esmen okay that is the end of chapter 11 on thermoelectric properties I must admit that uh that is a chapter that I hardly understand at all um I&#x27;m not sure um I&#x27;ve read it you know several times before um it hasn&#x27;t clicked in for me um I I&#x27;m not uh you know I definitely need to go back and uh look at it some more before I understand what&#x27;s going on there um now the next chapter is chapter 12 scaler motion and uh we will get into that chapter tomorrow uh I&#x27;m really running short on time here anyway the power has been out for like the last 4 hours so I kind of had to stay up to uh uh you know get my phone charged again and uh get started and try to get this video out there but since I finished uh quite a bit early um I&#x27;ll just say that uh we got some great things in store for this channel uh we&#x27;re going to uh try to wrap up this book uh which has many more chapters then we&#x27;re going to look at one of larsson&#x27;s books on economics called the road to permanent prosperity and then we&#x27;re going to look at a number of uh some of the notes that was that were taken from Bruce paret on rs2 um notes that I&#x27;ve taken from him mainly quotes uh of forum passages that he uh Bruce used to run uh three different Forums on the web uh and he made countless numbers of posts over the years on various aspects of RS to uh the reciprocal system to the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system sometimes uh Pet&#x27;s uh work is um you know really Illuminating sometimes it is uh confounding or even um it clouds up the picture because uh just when you think you&#x27;ve learned Larson then pet comes along and and shows uh that Larson um is missing something and you know so he adds another another piece that you have to learn in so sometimes uh studying pet can be a double-edged sword but I do believe that he made some great advances in um our understanding of the reciprocal system and that we need to uh take those into account and maybe not uh accept all of them but take them into account when we weigh uh our understanding of the reciprocal system along with uh Dr Pet&#x27;s understanding of the um of rs2 and unfortunately Dr pet also passed away here back in 2020 so he can&#x27;t speak for himself but um I&#x27;m going to try to uh do a lot of quoting of him in um uh a lot of those notes I have several hundred pages of notes from that and I&#x27;ll try to uh kind of U organize them at least in a coherent fashion so that we can go over some of those notes as well and then we will be moving on to a no a new topic uh which I think we&#x27;re going to move on to some Buck Mis Fuller some synergetic geometry look forward to also learning some Ben Iverson on Quantum arithmetic uh we&#x27;re going to get into I believe some music theory as well um not only um uh we&#x27;re going to look at uh some of my work um my historical work on some uh really great uh so-called Jazz musicians and uh we&#x27;re going to look at some music theory uh look at a little bit of Harry parch uh we&#x27;re also going to look at um God I can&#x27;t even remember the the author of the book at this point um but he&#x27;s a guy that lives out in Texas uh the book is called interference and uh uh Joseph schill ER on music theory and uh yeah so that might take us all the way through the uh 2024 year but I think we&#x27;re also going to um do be looking at some ancient history as well in particular uh we&#x27;re going to look look a lot at the writings of Josephus and um maybe a few other first century uh Scholars like sweet tonius uh especially in the context of some of the work of Joseph at will and so that will be something to look forward to so this channel will be um and I might also start uh going live here on I guess on YouTube and whatever other platform I might end up on maybe Rumble uh and uh maybe do some live stuff but um great things coming our way in the meantime um you know study up on your reciprocal system we&#x27;re going to be uh getting into scaler motion which we&#x27;ve already learned about a little bit but uh scalar motion is so fundamental that uh it&#x27;d be good to uh hear Larson&#x27;s chapter here uh on this topic and in the meantime thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
