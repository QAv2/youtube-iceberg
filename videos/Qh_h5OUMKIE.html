            <p>[Music] welcome to reality check I&#x27;m Ross colart on assignment for news nation in America today we&#x27;re in Arizona on a story I can&#x27;t tell you about but I can assure you it&#x27;s a goodie so back in November last year at the soul conference I interviewed Tim gallet a former Admiral in the US Navy and also an oceanographer with the national iic Atmospheric Administration he told me why he believes the UAP coverup is real so today here&#x27;s an opportunity for you to hear the full interview including sections of the interview we recorded but couldn&#x27;t air last year because of time I hope you enjoy it Tim gadet has spent a career serving his country first in the Navy working in areas like aircraft carrier combat operations and assisting Navy SEAL Teams during counterterrorism operations according to His official biography more recently he served as acting administrator of the Commerce Department&#x27;s agency which forecasts weather and monitors ocean and atmospheric conditions where he analyzed the science behind weather and other phenomena so Tim you&#x27;ve said publicly that you think think UFOs uaps are the story of the century now I happen to agree with you but why do you say that oh absolutely we&#x27;re being visited by non-human intelligence with technology we really don&#x27;t understand and with intentions we don&#x27;t understand it all either and this is just one of those great big questions are we alone or not and we&#x27;re learning we&#x27;re not now that really does surpris me to hear that from a former very high ranking flag officer in the US Navy to actually say you&#x27;re stating categor Al that you believe nhi non-human intelligence are real absolutely I do why do you say that well for a number of reasons that have been coming out Congress has been informed and they&#x27;ve drafted legislation and they&#x27;ve passed legislation for example to establish a DOD office to look at it they done the same NASA did the same with a UAP study team and we know from the UAP hearing this summer uh that there are crash retrieval programs and I have 100% confidence that the testimony by David grush and the other Witnesses is accurate wow that&#x27;s a big thing for you to say that isn&#x27;t it it is it&#x27;s astonishing and that&#x27;s why I wrote that article in the hill I don&#x27;t understand why more people are are not uh interested in this I I mystify the lack of intellectual curiosity you know the moment for me was the Schumer amendment when the house sorry the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer put into proposed legislation language referring to non-human intelligence over 20 times exactly that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the statement and I Congress doesn&#x27;t act at that level without information clearly you believe there&#x27;s a cover up yes why are they covering it up I mean you&#x27;re probably one of the more highly cleared public officials from the military past serving who&#x27;s basically come out publicly and said you think this is real why do you think there is this coverup what are they concealing well sure this is technology we&#x27;re still trying to learn about and it could give us an advantage in any military conflict and that so that&#x27;s a good reason to not disclose the nature of the technology and I think for the foreseeable future we we don&#x27;t want to uh release and disclose all of the technology that we&#x27;ve recovered however I think it&#x27;s about time that we do disclose that we we are in contact with non-human intelligence that that&#x27;s what needs to be put out there in the public you very prominently set right behind Ryan graves in the house oversight hearing earlier this year you made a point of being seen to support Ryan Graves the former fighter pilot David fraver the former fighter pilot and David grush the former Pentagon intelligence officer for the ngia why did you take such a public position right well all those officers are speaking out about the phenomena and and the need to study it scientifically more and and and take policy measures for example Ryan is stood up at a nonprofit called The Americans for safe Aerospace with a very worthy mission to release more information and get Pilots to start reporting and really understand the nature of UAP for Aerospace safety what that&#x27;s a very worthy cause now one of my jobs in the Navy I was the chief meteorologist of the Navy at the time when Ryan was encountering the UAP off the US East Co post and and when I saw that these were occurring and I I think it&#x27;s people know that I received a secret email with the goast video attached to it from my boss my boss&#x27;s operations officer that where I learn now that these were happening and occurring in in training airspace and causing near midair collisions so that safety issue is is important and I couldn&#x27;t believe well I understood why but the Navy didn&#x27;t do anything about that and they actually pulled back that email from my computer on the secret Network because of the classification issues that we were just talking about shouldn&#x27;t there be I mean philosophically shouldn&#x27;t it be really important that somebody certainly at your level in the Navy be allowed to talk openly to your colleagues about the flight safety risks that these kind of things absolutely absolutely this is a safety issue so why do you think they tried to suppress knowledge of that video well it&#x27;s the over classification issue that that we&#x27;ve touched on that that these UA p and the Crash retrieval objects are classified and it&#x27;s really kind of a cold war Legacy of over classification Tim I have to say I think a lot of people sitting back home will be scratching their heads going wow a former flag officer in the US Navy a former rear Admiral is talking about the existence of a non-human intelligence they&#x27;re probably baffled as to why you&#x27;ve reached that conclusion is there something you know from your brief briefings as an officer Secret intelligence that you obtained how have you come by this conclusion a few a few reasons for that Ross first off I had a job where I was the superintendent of the US Naval Observatory and I had a team of astrophysicists that monitored the stars and made Star cataloges and I learned a lot about astrophysics then and I came to appreciate how large the universe is and you just cannot conclude when you know that there&#x27;s 200 to 300 billion stars in our galaxy and there&#x27;s hundreds of billions of galaxies to think that we&#x27;re alone is incredibly arrogant for one and then two as I mentioned I saw on a secret email the goast video in 2015 I believe and and then that just I I knew that was not our technology are you disappointed that the US government&#x27;s not doing more datadriven Empirical research investigating uaps I I am I I think it&#x27;s time now and and with the soul Foundation coming out in this Symposium here this is exactly what we&#x27;re trying to do is make policy recommendations to the US government to begin more systematic scientific study of UAP in a number of ways and what soul is looking at is both hard science trying to acquire some of the materials we have from the crash retrieval program so we can learn more about that technology which could have incredible benefits to society as well as some of the Humanity&#x27;s aspects so things like sociology and anthropology and uh and and some of the uh I guess ethics issues possibly the problem Tim is that a lot of the government is still in absolute denial I mean you talk as a fact about a crash retrieval program and we&#x27;re talking here about retrieved non-human technology aren&#x27;t we yes and yet there are people in the government like until very recently the pentagon&#x27;s spokesperson on uaps Dr Shan Kirkpatrick is still saying he&#x27;s seen no credible evidence of this phenomena what do you say to that so what you have going on right now are again Legacy classified program special access programs and without Congressional Direction and White House policy that&#x27;s not going to change and so I I don&#x27;t criticize for example Sean kir patri because he&#x27;s just a good soldier doing what he&#x27;s told to do the people that there has to be legislation so the Schumer amendment is just a must do and then there has to be uh the White House issuing policy and right now you it&#x27;s not coming from Kirk Patrick it&#x27;s coming from the white house because the dod the Secretary of Defense doesn&#x27;t do anything that is counter to the White House policy and they&#x27;ve obviously to me not have decided on a policy of non-disclosure can I ask you this I can understand why it might be decided by very senior people in the defense department that we shouldn&#x27;t reveal technology because it&#x27;s a weapon a potential Weapon It&#x27;s a potential advantage in a future War you can understand that count you absolutely I I and I think some of the technology should remain class we don&#x27;t want it to get in the hands of our adversaries However the fact that we&#x27;re being visited by non-human intelligence that is what I think needs to be disclosed now granted it&#x27;s not an easy thing for a government to do because then they&#x27;re going to admit that they don&#x27;t really know what they are or their intentions and it makes us look vulnerable true but I think as a society we&#x27;re ready for this we&#x27;ve turned that corner why is the soul foundation so important right so we&#x27;re at a time now where previously UAP have been pretty much received stigma and skepticism and we&#x27;re changing that this we&#x27;re at a inflection point in our understanding of this phenomena and soul is coming out now to advance the scientific study the education for the public collaborative sharing of insights from Academia and um and and then policy recommendations to encourage transparency by our government what sort of research would you like soul to do well I&#x27;m of course interested in the technology aspects of the UAP phenomena that&#x27;s fascinating to me but there there are other elements again I mean the social cultural uh I guess implications are great we&#x27;re not alone this is what we&#x27;re learning that that uh that in itself is something worthy of deep and great study you know it&#x27;s amazing I think a lot of us watching on would think that somebody at your level of seniority in the US Navy and then in Noah I would have thought you would have been briefed into something like this program oh no no their special access programs are very tightly restricted and so you have to look at what one&#x27;s job is and and that that need to know right if they have a classification or clearance at a certain level and then do they have a need to know those are the two prerequisites in my job as the oceanographer of the Navy for example it it really wouldn&#x27;t have made sense for me to have been read into these crash retrieval programs the obvious question then is clearly the government knows a lot more than it&#x27;s letting on here&#x27;s Soul starting out doing virgin research and yet the best research is probably hidden inside some of these special access programs would you like to see the government sharing more of that data absolutely and that&#x27;s the purpose of the Schumer Amendment and and that&#x27;s what we want to see is we want this panel that it directs to convene and review the these programs and make a determination on what can be released or disclosed without compromising National Security Tim I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that the jet fighter pilots who came forward a US Navy there&#x27;s a lot of US Navy behind the push for transparency it&#x27;s the US Navy more switched on to the need for transparency and disclosure on the UAP issue than the say let&#x27;s guess the Air Force perhaps well the statistics of disclosure certainly make that the case and you&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve seen that with Ryan Graves and David David fraver for example Alex Dietrich why is the US Navy different from the US Air Force on disclosure right well I think Steve uh Pardon Me Chris melon uh wrote an oped I believe it was in Politico but you&#x27;ll have to check about this about the Air Force not disclosing at a level like the Navy and I i&#x27; I&#x27;d speculate but having been in the Navy for 32 years and knowing how the two Services operate I I think it&#x27;s safe to say there&#x27;s there&#x27;s cultural differences you have a service culture in the Navy that is about going out to seea it ships and having to make decisions on your own without higher headquarters permission whereas the Air Force being located at bases primarily and and so and many of them are are are are in the US uh there&#x27;s more of a hierarchical mindset and so they are just afraid to basically make a bold statement about what they know so it&#x27;s official Sailors are more honest than than I know about honesty but I&#x27;ll say they are they&#x27;re they&#x27;re less risk averse Tim gallit thanks very much thank you Ross thanks for watching go to joinin in.com to find newsnation on your
