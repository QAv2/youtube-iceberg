            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Did you get your information cleared from the Pentagon? Yeah. Do you have a book? Yeah. And it all goes, did you did you release some photos that were fake? I&#x27;m over here. Then you go, Bob Lazar, he has none of that stuff. Did the government target you? Did they try to discredit you? You know, have you been ostracized? When when Lazar came out, I think was to George Knap, he was he didn&#x27;t say his name, right? He didn&#x27;t have any books.</p>
<p>The first book, I think, was with him and Jeremy in 2019, right? So Lazar to me is the most credible of the whistleblowers, right? But um but Jeremy and George just had a whistleblower a couple of weeks ago who&#x27;s pretty credible. He&#x27;s a young guy. He&#x27;s clear clearly nervous and he has some very interesting information about um what is it? Immaculate constellation. Which guy is this? I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t remember his name. It&#x27;s very new.</p>
<p>Is that the bald guy? No, no, no. The bald guy, I think, is Air Force intelligence. This is a kid whose career is ruined and he&#x27;s maybe in his 20s and you can see he&#x27;s clearly nervous. Um, and what is his claim? His claim is that he was going through some files, you know, he&#x27;s got top secret clearance and he found the Immaculate Constellation project, basically a PowerPoint presentation and his job was just to sort these files. He and he&#x27;s looking through it and suddenly it&#x27;s like, whoa, this is about recovery and alien craft and uh and he did the right thing and went to his superiors and said, you know, there&#x27;s a leakage.</p>
<p>I saw information I maybe wasn&#x27;t supposed to. I&#x27;m just letting you know. And his peers were like, &quot;Yeah, forget about it.&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;And that was it. It&#x27;s just no reprimand, no nothing. I just went back to work.&quot; But he was too fascinated by the document, so he kept pursuing it and pursuing it.</p>
<p>And um and now he talks about it. I don&#x27;t know his name, but if you track down, you know, Jeremy and George, you&#x27;ll find it easily. That&#x27;s the kid. Yeah. So, here&#x27;s a way that I would kind of try to debunk that if I was being logical.</p>
