            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>You’ve just succeeded in doing something  that no person has accomplished,   and that’s infiltrate the U.S. government’s  secret facility located in the Nevada desert,   the mysterious black site known as Area 51. You look the part, having spent the last year   studying and then stealing the identity of your </p>
<p>uncle Clarence, a man that works at the facility   and who once said to you, “I can’t tell you what  I do kid, but I can tell you this, you wouldn’t   believe me if I did tell you.” And now you’re in.  You come to a door deep within the facility,  having navigated a labyrinth of corridors.   Above the door is a sign, and in bold red letters  it reads, RESTRICTED.</p>
<p>Your heart is beating fast,   your hands are trembling as you swipe the ID  card. The door buzzes and with a swooshing   sound it moves to the side. “Oh, my good God,” you think,   “This is what they are hiding from us.” Ok, so that might sound like something from   a James Bond movie, and we imagine long before </p>
<p>you got to that door you’d have been arrested or   killed. But what if you really could get that far?  What would you see? You’d certainly see something   surprising, that’s for sure, because there’s a  good reason the USA keeps its black sites secret.  Before we tell you where the billions of dollars  go, let’s first look at the history of what’s   sometimes referred to as the black budget.</p>
<p>So, what we know is that the U.S military   is constantly involved in secret research  projects. You won’t be surprised to learn   that as you watch this video the military  is running all kinds of covert operations.  If you listen to guys like the whistleblower  named Edward Snowden, you’d hear that many   billions of dollars are spent on these operations. </p>
<p>These projects are incredibly secret, so much so   that they are often hidden from various elected  officials. They are as black as black gets.  However, time passes and things that were  secret before, become common knowledge.   Take for example the bunch of scientists and  military men that got together during the   second world war.</p>
<p>They wanted to build a nuclear  bomb, and so around 130,000 people got to work   under what was known as the Manhattan Project. The black sites where the research and development   took place were located not just in the U.S., but  also in Canada and the UK. It was a huge project,   and something like $2 billion dollars was spent </p>
<p>on it. That’s about $25 billion in today’s money.  So, that’s a good example of the black budget,  but you’ve gotta ask, if they were capable of   producing world-destroying weapons around  80 years ago, what are they capable of now?  Well, let’s first go back to the 1980s, a  decade in which a man named Ronald Reagan   was the president of the U.S.</p>
<p>When he sat  in the big chair the black budget tripled.   We found a declassified CIA document that  explained what some of that cash was spent on.  That document explained that even congress wasn’t  party to what happened in some of the programs.   It seems that the only rule about the black  budget is you don’t talk about the black budget,   but thankfully we have that </p>
<p>thing called declassification.  Under Regan, the military had one secret project  called “The Defense Communication’s Island Sun”.   It wasn’t all that high-tech, and just involved  the military making special lead-lined trucks   that could transport top brass generals in the  event of a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union.  Getting bombed by the Soviets was what  you might call a top priority threat,   and that’s why billions were spent on something </p>
<p>called operation Milstar, a project consisting   of creating a massive communications network if  those nuclear bombs should ever fall on the U.S.  Maybe that’s not strange enough for you, but  we’ve only just started. Be patient dear viewer,   you don’t know what’s coming. The U.S has built some pretty incredible   secret weapons with the budget, with one being </p>
<p>the very odd-looking Northrop Tacit Blue plane. This plane, that was sometimes  nicknamed the “Alien School Bus”,   was called a low-observable stealth surveillance  aircraft. It was very hard to detect by enemy   radar even when very close to a battlefield.</p>
<p>Even though it looked a bit like a flying   white chocolate bar, the plane was extremely  high-tech when it was built in the early 80s.   The thing is, you wouldn’t have known  anything about it. That’s because when   the military started the “Battlefield Surveillance  Aircraft-Experimental program” it was top secret.  It was developed and built at Area 51 and flown </p>
<p>first by a test pilot named Richard G. Thomas.   And no, he didn’t get shot down. He lived to the  ripe old age of 76. You only got to hear about the   plane in 1996, when information about it became </p>
<p>declassified. We learned then that the cost of   building that ugly thing was over two billion  when you take into account the entire project.  After hearing that, you might wonder what  concoctions are currently flying above your   head. What do billions get you these days?</p>
<p>Well, we can tell that some black projects   relate to what are called “psychological  operations” or Psy Ops for short.  These very covert operations might sound like  something from an outlandish YouTube conspiracy   theory video, but we can tell you that they are  very real. You can see declassified CIA documents   that tell you that cash is spent on getting into </p>
<p>the heads of people, whether at home or abroad.  At home, the CIA wants the  people to think a certain way,   say about invading a foreign country. It wants the  people on-side and it wants the soldiers onside,   and so by disseminating information it  wins the hearts and minds of the people.  Social media is where the new infowar is taking </p>
<p>place, and many countries right now are running   their own propaganda campaigns there. You probably  don’t know this, but there is white, grey,   and black propaganda when used for psychological  operations. White is basically true information;   grey is kinda true, and black is outright deceit.</p>
<p>What the CIA is up to right now in regard to   PSYOps we just can’t say, because it is top  secret. But trust us, something will be going   down, either at home or abroad. The CIA has  even been known to infiltrate people’s TVs,   so you might wonder if you’ve ever </p>
<p>viewed any CIA-backed information online.  It’s not a secret that it happens; we just  aren’t privy to the details. The Department   of Defense even has its own description of  psychological warfare. It goes like this:  “The planned use of propaganda and other </p>
<p>psychological actions having the primary   purpose of influencing the opinions, emotions,  attitudes, and behavior of hostile foreign groups   in such a way as to support the  achievement of national objectives.”  The CIA has also had a hand in Hollywood,  shaping what we see on our screen in the   interest of national security. Secretly the Pentagon has backed   over a 1,000 movies and has had a hand in </p>
<p>developing lots of titles you’ve seen on TV.   You can now find some of this information  through the “US Freedom of Information   Act”, and if you look at that, you’ll see CIA  backed movies such as Transformers, Flight 93,   Iron Man, and The Terminator. It’s all about  winning hearts and minds, and it isn’t cheap.  It doesn’t just create, it also omits.</p>
<p>For  instance, when the CIA saw the script for the   movie called “Meet The Parents” starring Robert De  Niro, it said hey, we don’t want to see any agency   torture manuals. When Marlon Brando was going to  release a movie about the Iran-Contra scandal,   he was outbid on the rights by a film studio. </p>
<p>It’s now thought the CIA was behind this,   that the film studio was a front  company that was created by the CIA.  Then you had Operation Mockingbird during  the Cold War. The covert operation involved   the CIA creating fronts that appeared to people  like magazines or cultural organizations.</p>
<p>The   operation also included infiltrating popular  news media such as The Washington Post,   The New York Times and Newsweek. The worrying thing is, if you believe   what some researchers now tell us, the program  has never officially been discontinued. We   just don’t know what’s going on since how </p>
<p>the CIA influences media and film is covert,   but it’s likely that hearts and minds are  being steered in certain directions today.  So, we must remember that a large part of the  black budget, many billions in fact, goes towards   what we call non-military projects. Much of this  involves surveillance, and that surveillance   is done in the name of national security.</p>
<p>In 2013, news media talked about a $52.6   billion black budget, saying then that while the  government doesn’t deny the money is being spent,   it doesn’t ever say how it’s being spent.  Back then the National Intelligence Program   comprised 107,035 employees working  in 16 different spy agencies, so a lot   of the cash went towards paying those people. You might have heard of one of those employees,   an intelligence contractor named Edward </p>
<p>Snowden. He blew the whistle on various   global surveillance programs and then  had to get the hell out of America.  It’s a long story, but in the interests of this  show we can tell you that black ops run by the U.S   government, sometimes with UK intelligence,  involves a lot of spying.</p>
<p>Spying on people   of interest, but also on folks just like you.  According to the Washington Post, that received   information from Snowden, 90 percent of the  spying was on what it called ordinary Americans.  When asked about all that spying and where all  the black budget cash goes, the Office of the   Director of National Intelligence had this to say: “Our budgets are classified as they could provide   insight for foreign intelligence services </p>
<p>to discern our top national priorities,   capabilities and sources and methods that allow  us to obtain information to counter threats.”  Ok then, we’ll have to look elsewhere. It’s estimated that around 50 percent of the   black budget goes to the National Security Agency,  with the people that work there mainly being   tasked to develop surveillance technology and then  implement it.</p>
<p>But what about the rest of the cash?  Well, first we should tell you that the black  budget was dramatically increased during the   Reagan years; under George Bush it doubled and it  was increased a lot under the present president.  When Bush was president something  called Program Element 0603891c   received almost two hundred million dollars, which  is quite the chunk of money.</p>
<p>Since the project was   secret, no one really knew what it was about,  although analysts that studied the budget said   it involved creating space weapons. Ok, so now it gets a bit weird.  While people that work at various black sites  don’t tell us what they do, many of them wear   uniforms with patches on them. The patches likely </p>
<p>designate what kind of work they do. One guy   managed to get photos of 75 different patches. Some of the designs featured demons,   scantily clad warriors, dragons releasing bombs,  wizards, and skunks firing laser beams into the   air. Another featured a dragon whose wings were </p>
<p>the American flag. It had the Earth held in   its giant claws. The people wearing that patch  worked for the National Reconnaissance Office.  Make of that what you will, but it’s unlikely  that the patches don’t represent anything at all.   The Pentagon was contacted by the New </p>
<p>York Times and asked about those patches,   but as usual, it was tight-lipped. If you had the black budget document   in front of you, much of it would be covered  with the word classified. But we did manage   to see the names of some projects on a recent  budget.</p>
<p>The problem is that it’s hard to work   out what the project is about from the name. An example is the project “tractor hip.” That   was $16.4 million that went to the army,  but you might wonder what a tractor hip is.   Then there was the project “Chalk Eagle”. That  went to the navy and cost a whopping $534 million.  Some other names were Retract Juniper, Link </p>
<p>Evergreen, Pilot Fish, Chalk Coral, Link Plumeria,   Retract Maple, Cobra Judy, and Tractor Cage. Some of the latest projects are thought to   be space weapons programs, but no one is really  sure. When the director of national intelligence   was asked recently, he replied with this: “Beyond the disclosure of the NIP top-line figure,   there will be no other disclosures of currently </p>
<p>classified NIP budget information because such   disclosures could harm national security.”  NIP stands for National Intelligence Program.  So, what’s going on right now at all those black  sites, we can’t say for sure, but we think after   watching this video you have a pretty good idea. Now you need to watch, “What Happens At &amp; What   Do We Know About Area 51?” and then,  “Evidence That Aliens Have Made Contact.”</p>
