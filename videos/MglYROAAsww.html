            <p>yeah we we were working as subcontractors to bigger airspace advanced based studies who had the contract to the defense intelligence agency uh yeah there have been crashes uh the superpowers on the earth have had their of crashes and they have recovered the vehicles from their crashes so uh that&#x27;s why shocked lee and i agree that even though these things behave like a conscious psychic entity they do have a advanced technology they have hardware and uh there&#x27;s a craft and there&#x27;s occupants or youthful knots that he calls them that shockingly calls them euphemisms so there&#x27;s uh euphonists running these craft uh the point is is that uh that these things are operating they go way outside the envelope of our engineering and physics technologies and and uh uh i can guarantee you that no laws of physics are broken whatsoever it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s either uh the existing laws that we have but we haven&#x27;t uh extrapolated it further enough further enough or expanded it enough into realms or uh say areas of phase space where we could discover new solutions to uh these existing physical laws which would give us advanced propulsion and power that would produce this type of technology once you have an engineering and manufacturing technology to create these things so that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at and these things don&#x27;t look like anything that we can manufacture on earth so we don&#x27;t have the manufacturing or industrial technology for it we&#x27;re like for example that&#x27;s what the 38 papers that the dia wanted in their tasks with their bigger aerospace advanced space studies contract was to take the physics that physics and engineering of 20 of 2009 and 2010 extrapolated to 2050. are we going to be able to have the physics and engineering and the technology industrial base that will produce a vehicle that&#x27;ll match the tic tacs and on the flip side of that boy that would be wonderful we could get there because commercially it would revolutionize transportation and energy on the earth and the interesting thing is today there&#x27;s a big move away from special access programs they&#x27;re extremely costly to maintain extremely costly let me tell you this uh the cost to maintain information personnel and physical security for a special action program can be tens of times larger than the cost of the program itself the purpose of a black program with the special access program security wrap is you&#x27;ve got to limit the information and exposure to the information to as few people as possible in order to produce the maximum security protection against espionage by the enemy</p>
