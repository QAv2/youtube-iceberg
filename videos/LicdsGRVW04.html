            <p>[Music] I believe that water will one day be employed as a fuel that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it used singly or together will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light of an intensity of which coal is not capable I believe then that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water water will be the coal of the future sure [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] energy is the central commodity of global civilization without huge energy resources to supply the growing needs of humanity economic and social progress would stagnate and the world would plunge into a new dark age today we expend the equivalent of 2,000 barrels of oil per second and this is growing especially in developing [Music] nations in the late 20th century Wars have been fought over the control of oil buried beneath shifting Desert Sands and this source of energy will one day run out though perhaps long after irreversible environmental damage has been done new clean energy sources are sorely needed to replace polluting fossil fuels many say that all the peoples of the world especially in the industrialized nations need to scale back their energy consumption ending their hopes for a brighter future others say our salvation lies in Renewables such as solar and wind power however the limitations of these passive Energy Systems with their dependence on favorable weather conditions and locations preclude them from being the Ultimate Energy Solution yet what if there were an ultimate solution of virtually infinite clean energy from a substance almost no one had previously suspected Airy water that covers 70% of the surface of our planet and gives life to all biological systems and what if such a simple invention was already in existence producing power safely and cleanly in 1989 the prospect of a water fuel age foretold by Jules Vern over a century ago came into sharp Focus with the announcement of a startling Discovery at the University of Utah two respected chemists Dr Martin fman and Dr Stanley ponds announced that they had achieved the unthinkable an inexhaustible source of energy that they could demonstrate with a simple electrochemical cell basically we&#x27;ve established a sustained nuclear fusion reaction by means by means which are considerably simpler uh than conventional techniques they claimed that they had discovered a heretofor unknown nuclear likee reaction that would make water a powerful fuel for the future it became known as cold fusion because it apparently delivered Fusion Energy like that produced in the Sun or by hydrogen bonds yet not at millions of degrees but much closer to room temperatures moreover it emitted no deadly radiation [Music] ironically the press conference came less than 12 hours before the Exon Valdes ran ground off the coast of Alaska spilling millions of gallons of oil into pristine Waters it is now a decade later where the world so desperate for new sources of clean energy what happened to the promise of cold fusion it was a big story then making headlines around the world but all of a sudden it died out and we were told that it was just another false promise was cold fusion too good to be true a mistake by overzealous scientists or is it a real phenomenon just not easily understood and if so why haven&#x27;t we heard much about it since then in this program you will see that the field although small is still very much alive with working devices that seem to defy conventional physics and chemistry scientists and technologists all over the world are putting the pieces of the puzzle together in an international effort to determine what is taking place in Cold Fusion cells and how to engineer that into commercial applications is it just wishful thinking or are we about to witness the coming of a new energy Revolution as we uncover the secrets of making fire from [Music] water this is the the apparatus and very simply when positively charged deuterons are attracted to the plaum cathode they cram together and there&#x27;re millions and millions of them inside the cathode getting closer and closer and then they they fuse and they create energy in the form of helium but how do we know it works because it&#x27;s there it&#x27;s in nature the raw natural power just waiting to be harnessed and when we we ignite that cold fusion fire I mean just imagine there&#x27;s more energy in one cubic mile of seawater than in all the known oil reserves on Earth I mean you could drive your car 55 million miles on a gallon of heavy water maybe the end of pollution warmth for the whole world Hollywood movies often exaggerate great reality in order to tell a compelling story that will entertain and enthra yet Hollywood&#x27;s best writers could hardly dream up a more dramatic tale than the true story which began with fcman and pawns and is still unfolding as one of the most intense controversies in the history of Science Fusion is a process that releases huge amounts of energy when two Atomic nuclei usually hydrogen Isotopes Collide and fused together theoretically this can occur only at extreme temperatures for decades scientists at Princeton MIT and other institutions have been pouring billions of government dollars into building plasma Fusion reactors magnetically ringed vessels called tokomak that could contain this hot fusion reaction their goal to bring the nuclear fire of the sun down to earth using the hydrogen in water as fuel although much has been learned in the Quest for controlled Fusion success has been Elusive and the promise of hot Fusion remains as distant as ever to date not one extra watt of power beyond the electrical power fed in has ever been generated water itself is quite a mysterious and Powerful substance given enough time it can erode steel and rock it is composed of hydrogen and oxygen two of the most reactive elements on earth science has also known for over 200 years how to extract hydrogen and oxygen gas from water through the process of electrolysis it was from this field of electrochemistry and not Nuclear Physics that there emerged a revolutionary idea idea of a new kind of fire from water in the 1980s fmen and ponds used their own money to conduct experiments for 5 years they passed a current through an electrochemical cell containing heavy water or duum oxide one of the electrodes the negatively charged cathode was made of the precious metal padium the electrical current separated individual duum nuclei or deuterons from the heavy water and forced them to pack tightly into the Palladium cathode what happened next inside the Palladium at the atomic level remains a mystery and became the subject of intense debate whether it was actual nuclear fusion or some other as yet unknown phenomenon the result produced far more excess heat energy than any known chemical reaction why is such a phenomenon so astonishing why did it provoke such outrage in the physics Community to most classically trained physicists the concept of low-level nuclear reactions producing significant heat energy was inconceivable the nuclei of atoms are all positively charged and naturally repel one another they don&#x27;t want to come together to fuse except at millions of degrees and when they do deadly radiation is released when fmen and ponds claimed that they had created nuclear reactions at room temperature University and government Laboratories around the world immediately set out to replicate the experiment which superficially looked simple some reported similar anomalous heat and nuclear byproducts such as tritium lowlevel neutrons and helium others at major universities such as MIT and Caltech claimed they had found nothing and what we see in our laboratory is no evidence for any unusual nuclear or chemical reactions critics insisted that if nuclear reactions were occurring flashmen and pawns should have been killed by the radiation grumbling from frustrated researchers grew louder as accusations of faulty measurements and sloppy techniques were leveled at the two electrochemist University of Utah officials were chastised for their haste in publicizing the discovery through the media instead of the peer review process the emerging data was being drowned out amidst the clamor over impropriety and accusations of outright fraud in conclusion we have no evidence in our laboratory with any of our samples for Fusion I&#x27;m very sorry that uh Professor Lewis has no information on the titium levels that is available and is available in the correction list to the paper we know the foreground we don&#x27;t know the background I would like to spe background I beg your pardon the background is available in the corrections to the paper that might be I would like to specifically hear whether not don&#x27;t don&#x27;t could we go on could we go on to the questions please certain it was a very unfortunate time to make such an announcement for various re political reasons really the situation in the United States the situation with regard to the program in hot fusion um so uh that was against it but U also of course was the fact that uh we were not ready to make such an announcement in April 1989 the US Department of energy convened a panel led by Dr John husena an early cold fusion critic we wrote a very negative report and concluded that the results that were being presented to us were contrary to everything we had found out about nuclear physics over the last 50 years editor John Maddox of the prestigious journal Nature nailed the lid on the coffin I think that broadly speaking it&#x27;s dead and it&#x27;ll remain dead for a long long time and of course we didn&#x27;t call it cold fusion at all that was a term which was wished on us but we never called it that um we felt the processes had to be nuclear to account for the high levels of the energy per atom earlier in this Century a very distinguished chemist by the name of Irving langr defined pathological science as the science of things that aren&#x27;t true and I have labeled my book uh cold fusion the scientific fosco of the century simply because there&#x27;s no experimental evidence at this point that any nuclear reaction products have been formed therefore the claim that cold fusion is a nuclear reaction process without a commensurate amount of nuclear reaction Pro um products is simply pathological science the criticism of pathological science is one which has quite frequently been leveled at unusual investigations which admittedly sometimes are at fault however there is also the the situation that people will criticize a field uh long after they should really have given up and that is pathological criticism they just get trapped in a situation they have made a criticism they have to maintain that criticism against all the evidence cold fusion uh violates most of what I was taught in nuclear chemistry and and that&#x27;s true of most people in the field so you have to have some very persuasive evidence for its existence that that evidence was not persuasive uh it was very indicative uh it was the kind of evidence that normal people would use to go the next step but it wasn&#x27;t the kind of evidence that would convert somebody who was basically uncertain as to the real reality of the of the phenomena the idea that two chemists could be doing this on a tabletop uh really sounded uh very almost Alice and Wonderland is I must say so uh I think our reaction was not unlike that of other physicists who who thought on the one hand gee that&#x27;d be marvelous if they&#x27;re doing it and then on the other hand my God chemists doing it for probably pennies compared to what physicists have uh have uh taken from the public coffer over the last 40 years the order of $40 billion to do hot Fusion so the Nuclear Physics Community said well you know the Nuclear Physics of this is looking very strange it doesn&#x27;t seem to be right where are the neutrons where are the GMA rays and eventually I think because of this uh nuclear bad nuclear physics and because of the fact that people were having difficulty reproducing this the physicist threw out the uh good baby which was the excess heat effect along with the bad uh nuclear interpretation bath water that was very unfortunate at SRI International in Meno Park California Dr Michael mcub was one of the first scientist to replicate the cold fusion effect for chos or not in the first experiment that we ran some three or 4 months after the initial announcement we saw some evidence of excess heat uh which is really sustained me uh ever since having seen the effect with my own eyes the claims from a few that this is impossible um inconsistent with all known laws of nuclear physics uh these these suggestions are in fact irrelevant there is no theoretical objection to Cold Fusion it&#x27;s just unlikely given our experience with uh hot Fusion at Texas A&amp;M a group led by Prof professor John bachus who was widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s greatest electrochemists reported finding the hydrogen isotope tritium a key signature that some unusual nuclear reaction was going on the the first thing was this uh this this thing called tritium which is a sub form of hydrogen which should not exist uh except in extremely tiny quantities we found that by working these cells of Flashman and ponds containing lithium hydroxide and detarium oxide that we could produce this tritium in great abundance let&#x27;s say at 10,000 times more than it ought to be there as it were and um Let me let me stress that we couldn&#x27;t do it every time but about one result in five one result in four and eventually we worked up to two results out of three um we could produce tritium that was the first thing and and in a way it was the first Clear Proof of the phenomenon halfway around the world at the Baba Atomic Research Center in India Dr mahadeva Shas provided confirmation within a few weeks within two or three weeks we got the first results and several groups started saying yes we are seeing excess heat and uh but the most important and unbelievable phenomenon at that time was the observation of tritium back at Texas a&amp; M bis&#x27;s Group found themselves under attack Science magazine writer Gary TOS wrote a stinging article that insinuated that someone in the group had spiked the samples with tritium although unfounded and eventually proved untrue the allegation effectively dampened bis&#x27;s remarkable claims well I was 69 years old at that time I took the attitude suppose they F me right it doesn&#x27;t really matter I had my career the worst they could do would be to say go your tenure is withdrawn and therefore I wasn&#x27;t frightened and I went on saying the truth publishing what we&#x27;d got and but finally the university uh revolted against this they set up an inquiry as they called it rather sinisterly the accusation was that that I had carried out misconduct of research you see I shouldn&#x27;t have worked on these things and they decided that the accusations were totally groundless and they published all this but then they started all again about 6 months later and they had another committee it was this time when my lawyers asked the university what the second inquiry was about they were told it&#x27;s an ad hoc committee what&#x27;s that um we have nothing further to tell you and so this went on for 11 months of constant meetings and inquiries and so on and I&#x27;m quite sure that they were trying to find an excuse to end my tenure you see getting tenure in most traditional uh science departments depends on doing mainstream research being a leader in mainstream research but doing mainstream research and not doing Fringe area research investigating things like cold fusion uh once you&#x27;re tenured uh it&#x27;s a bit of a different story in that uh in principle you can investigate any field you like and people have done that but even then uh the way things are connected uh with money uh Power in universities today uh your life can be made rather difficult if you are identified with those areas finally they came out uh okay I mean they gave me another letter I&#x27;d had the letter complete exoneration this time it said that they had spent this 11 months and had found that I had never done anything the phrase use were uh that contravene the rules of procedure of this University or something rather form and stuffy like that normally we&#x27;d say someone&#x27;s uh innocent to proven guilty and you&#x27;d be given the opportunity to have a trial rather than having an article written about what you&#x27;ve done wrong and identify as being guilty in the in the Press rather than uh due process anyway all these things were happening and uh it uh just makes one sad but I think the main part was that I had done work which was against the Paradigm and that was what they were really upset about you know people said that they&#x27;ve been to other universities and people have laughed at it and said what the heck are you doing trying to disprove the laws of nuclear physics and of course that&#x27;s exactly what we were doing and succeeding you see even though positive results were still coming in the department of Energy&#x27;s negative report effectively killed Congressional funding in the United States flashmen and pawns later packed their bags and left for France to carry on private research sponsored by the Toyota Corporation by 1992 we had video recordings of intense energy release by the summer of 1994 we had demonstrated sustained energy release that of course if you say you want you wish to make this into a device required further research and we were always working on a time frame of trying to get to that point by about the year 2000 and I think that if the resources had been available we would have got to the year to that that particular Point probably before the year 2000 but uh this did not happen [Music] [Music] despite the critics research on Cold Fusion did not disappear by 1999 eight major International conferences had been held several thousand technical papers had been written by hundreds of scientists in peer review journals and Technical magazines strong evidence that continues to mount up against the solitary doe report in the us the Electric Power Research Institute whose members include dozens of major utility corporations spent over $10 million to investigate the claims of fmen and Pawns in his final report in 1994 Epi concluded that the production of excess heat had been confirmed and definite evidence of nuclear reactions were detected when the irab panel came through with haena as a chairman on July the 6th 1989 to visit they were looking very um lightly at the heat measurements and very strongly at the absence of neutrons and tridium and um we had already admitted that there were none obviously we were still alive so um anyway um my feeling was that um once they saw no neutrons and trium they could use that to denounce the field and protect their budgets and fascinatingly uh many of the people on that panel a couple of them I should say came to me looking for research funds in this on this in this field even though publicly they were speaking before Congress against having Congress put any money in it which which goes to prove to you that uh the search for money in research is a very big thing and it&#x27;s uh sometimes takes precedence over the search what we would call for pure truth in the mid90s the government of Japan funded an official cold diffusion program under the banner of new hydrogen energy despite its short life today many Japanese scientists and companies quietly conduct sophisticated experimentation the Italian and French governments have begun their own research in the US scientists at government facilities like Los Alamos and the Naval Air Warfare Center at China Lake California have reported definitive observations in the commercial sector many small startup companies continue this revolutionary line of work even securing patents while carefully avoiding the stigma of being labeled cold fusion writer engineer and futurist Sir Arthur C Clark hased studied the controversy for years like everyone else I was very excited when the so-called cold fusion announcement was made and then again like everybody else I became disappointed and forgot about the whole thing when it seemed to be a mistake though I was rather puzzled why two worldclass scientists could have made such fools of themselves well during the years that followed slowly from time to time there came news of other deities repeating the experiment and getting positive results and there&#x27;s been a sort of ground swell all over the whole world of new information and during the course of the last five years or so I&#x27;ve slowly become convinced from my original skepticism to 99% certainty that it is for Real the evidence Now is really overwhelming if major government labs and universities around the world are publishing volumes of data that report the existence of excess heat and nuclear products why is there still a debate why do many influential Skeptics still insist that neither Fusion nor anything out of the ordinary is going on if you&#x27;re doing an experiment it should be reproducible should be able to if you put the same things in you should get the same thing out every time Douglas Morrison of the high energy Physics laboratory CERN is that despite 9 years of work nothing is reproducible they cannot consistently get the same result every time and uh this is a major problem means you don&#x27;t understand you&#x27;re not getting things and it raises suspicion that probably you&#x27;re making some mistake you have little fluctuations and you get a big fluctuation you Sav an effect and a small fluctuation you say nothing because people typically might do 20 experiments and get two or three they find something which suggests that you&#x27;re working just in sort of noise the background noise nothing actually there this is a very is the signal to noise ratio of the measurements strong enough so that scientists can be absolutely certain there has been no mistake that they are actually measuring excess heat cold fusion scientists long ago put the issue of measurement accuracy to rest like good scientists they tried to prove themselves wrong still the excess heat findings persist since 1848 it has been known that a certain amount of heat is required to change the temperature of a given amount of [Music] water at Premier Labs such as SRI International Dr Michael mcub has determined that the effect is neither fleeting nor difficult to measure the cold fusion cell is enclosed in a calorimeter which has thermocouples at various key points to read the temperatures the experiment looks extremely complex on the surface but fundamentally it is simple an ordinary coffee maker provides an analogy cold water goes in hot water comes out the temperature of the water is red before the electrical input is supplied and then again as it rises some of the heat is lost during the process but the result is obvious mover&#x27;s calorimeter Works in a similar way but with an accuracy of 1 1,000 of a degree the cooling water flows in a steady stream and passes the inlet thermocouple which measures the temperature it swirls around the cell cooling it down and carrying off the heat when it exits the outlet thermocouple measures the temperature again Inlet temperature is subtracted from Outlet temperature to determine how hot the water has become during its passage meanwhile input electricity to the cell is monitored during an experiment with the padium cathode for the first week while the cathode is loading no excess is detected later in a successful test the outlet water temperature climbs and total output energy from the cell exceeds input this is called excess energy excess heat is measured at least 30 times higher than the background noise often much higher remarkably the supposedly negative result on excess heat which critics often cite from the early days of cold fusion have been found to be highly flawed a case in point upon reexamination of the original raw data from the 1989 experiments at MIT there appeared startling discrepancies in the published results the raw data graph here shows excess heat well above the Baseline but in mit&#x27;s official publication the graph shows temperatures hovering around the Baseline suggesting no excess heat engineer Dr Eugene Mala a science journalist at MIT at the time resigned in protest in the case of MIT it was a disaster these people before even analyzing their calorimetry data held a party for the death of coal fusion and then they unfortunately fudged the data manipulated the data data to make a positive result look negative at the very least the people at MIT had an obligation to go back and check their experiment again their results don&#x27;t prove C Fusion but they certainly had a positive result Professor George Miley director of the fusion studies laboratory at the University of Illinois was one of the few editors of a peer-reviewed physics journal to accept papers on Cold Fusion positive measure ments of helium uh continued reports of heat burst uh uh the trium measurements that people have done while they&#x27;re not reproducible always the fact that they occur keep kept encouraging me let&#x27;s take Atrium as an example which is work that Tom clater has done at Los Almos at uh a meeting uh about a year ago where he was presenting his material I asked asking what I thought was a key question have you convinced your management at Los Elmos that trium is real because it seems like such a convincing case and he said no I haven&#x27;t I said why not he said well the problem is that I only get a positive results three times out of 10 now think about that if it happens once then inquisit inquisitive scientists should say well how did it happen let&#x27;s find out how we can make it happen again and how we can ultimately make it happen consistently the tridium work was the first indication to me that that there was a reality and then clater at Los Alamos also got positive results and so did Howard men love and they&#x27;re people that I respect and and could talk to personally I then wrote a review of the field looking at everybody&#x27;s work worldwide and talk to many of the people that were in in in the work and on the basis of of that review and personal knowledge of my own work and other people&#x27;s it became fairly clear that there was a a very strange phenomena occurring here there&#x27;s clearly evidence of anomalous excess heat which occur in these experiments under some rather difficult uh to achieve conditions but rather well- defined conditions there are also in similar experiments sometimes times and rather dissimilar experiments sometimes evidence of an anomalous nuclear process and both uh anomalies are worth uh pursuing it&#x27;s my suspicion my uh bias if you like that the two anomalies are in fact connected there&#x27;s an underlying fundamental uh mechanism which connects the two I would be satisfied with an accurate description of the method by which the lce the Palladium crystallin system with dyum inside it how that crystallin system interacts with the nuclear process there is something new coming up and so like everybody uh you know professors who teach physics hate to change their courses and generally they don&#x27;t appreciate monsters which crop up and which cannot be explained explained within the frame of the present [Music] knowledge since prehistoric times people knew that a certain amount of f fuel always gave a certain amount of energy whether burning wood coal or oil the process is a simple chemical reaction then in 1896 HRI Beckel discovered radioactivity he found materials that do stay hot for weeks later Madame Cy and others discovered that some materials such as radium produce heat for centuries and even in Millennia a million times more energy can be produced by radium than by a chemical fuel weighing the same it&#x27;s been known since then that radioactivity not only produces heat but never consumes the fuel no change would be observed until thousands of years later when the radium turned to lead with only a minute amount of mass lost in the transfer to heat energy radioactive plutonium glows for decades powering unmanned probes that venture out through Interstellar [Music] space if a cold fusion cathode were a typical chemical reaction it would get hot and within a few minutes it would be consumed the reaction would stop in fact there are no known chemical fuels in the cell it contains mostly water which is chemically inert water cannot burn yet in experiments cold fusion heat has continued for days sometimes weeks the only thing modern science knows that is consistent with this is a nuclear reaction however it is conceivable that there may be a process even more powerful than nuclear reaction that physics does not yet understand that is the mystery of cold fusion for the though scientists have identified Telltale nuclear changes in Cold Fusion materials they cannot agree on what exactly is this reaction or set of reactions that produce excess heat cohesion and condensation into cohesive packages to me is very attractive but then there are other ones involving various kinds of uh other nuclear particles why coherence effects because that allows you to couple the energy of the nuclear reaction to the lattice so you get heat instead of radiation in addition to being a miracle of allowing two nuclei to get together it has to be a miracle of changing the pathway that those two nuclei would take upon fusing tarium and hydrogen exists in the latice as neutrons and protons so of course you can move them along the ltis with by imposing an electric field in the ltis it&#x27;s also absorbing as much energy from the zero point field as it&#x27;s giving back to the zero point field and um essentially a zero point field is a feature that comes out of quantum mechanics in fact this whole area is going to turn out to be just another one of the surprises of the quantum mechanics Revolution that Revolution is not over lately I&#x27;ve being able to verify one aspect one prediction of the latest Theory the poly Neutron Theory but even that is at the present time a tentative um acceptance of the interpretation of the results my Approach is that probably you can transfer energy by pumping small portions of energy just fractions of electron Vols but doing it at relatively high frequencies water when you nanostructure it has some very interesting properties in particular it has catalytic properties we believe there are various at least three conflicting interpretations one of them is just it&#x27;s some property of hydrogen or detarium inside matter or it&#x27;s a property of the particles themselves which is revealed by the absorption within solid matter well our critics would say that the problem with cold fusion is that there is no Theory to describe it the problem problem is completely different the problem is that there are far too many theories which purport to describe the same set of observations and no more than one of these theories can be uh correct so we are uh embarrassed with an excess of theories which means that it&#x27;s difficult for me an experimentalist to decide amongst the theories to see which one I should examine and uh test inside the metal lce exists a world so spal and expansive that hydrogen atoms can nest in a virtually one: one ratio with each atom of Palladium this creates a metast stable state which can sometimes release enormous energy but how that happens is what theorists like the late Nobel laurate Julian schwinger mit&#x27;s Peter hagelstein and other Brilliant Minds have attempted to explain and therefore reliably Matrix element it might have 10 to the 10th Dimensions if we are not able to explain the new phenomena in a unique consistent way will be in deep trouble so that uh uh the only way the physic can go can do is to push research uh and to find crucial experiments still the lack of a theoretical framework does not deter those who see the potential for commercial devices at the moment uh 10 watts per cc is about the maximum we can get regularly there are odd people here and there who claim much more on I I believe them but uh you know how often can they get it that&#x27;s the point now were we able to get 100 watts per CC well then we would have a fantastic and and reproduce it then we would have a source which would be better than any nuclear energy we&#x27;ve had so far and also of course completely clean because it produces helium which was totally totally harmless because the stakes are so great private Enterprise especially in the United States is paying close attention to the field one company that has already begun commercialization is Clean Energy Technologies of aota Florida their Patterson power cell has received over a dozen patents for its unique design which uses ordinary water and Tiny metal coated beads made of Palladium and nickel they claim to have achieved up to 1,000 times the input power from their experimental cells we&#x27;re getting nuclear energy output without the nuclear radiation byproducts some of the critics of Technology you pointed out that you needed Palladium and heavy water those are available but they&#x27;re not infinitely available uh but as stud&#x27;s technology works with hydrogen or regular water rather than heavy water and we&#x27;ve also found other elements such as nickel and as reported at the conference today some people have found titanium and tungsten at work and we&#x27;re just at the start of this technology I think we&#x27;ll find a number of metals and combinations that can be used to produce excess energy in tests sponsored by Motorola clear excess energy was observed in repeated experiments with the Patterson power cells emitting heat for 11 hours even after the tiny input electricity was turned off seti&#x27;s power cells have been examined in detail by numerous Laboratories including the French atomic energy commission is using small plastic it&#x27;s about 1 mm in diameter coated with nickel Plum and nickel each layer is about one micron very thin layers cold fusion seems to be a surface effect phenomenon it&#x27;s not a bulk effect it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bulk that&#x27;s coming from the surface so by doing that you have a lot of surface and little bulk and because that&#x27;s something to do that&#x27;s something to do with loading of duum in the crystal if you start with thin films you load them much faster and that&#x27;s the a big surprise they start producing excess seeds almost right away you know by the time we do the measurements there&#x27;s already excess seed the use of other elements besides padium is is an exciting extension of the field and it&#x27;s made it obvious that there is a wide spectrum of environments chemical environments in which these nuclear reactions can occur and some of these environments are much easier to produce uh than others and in particular it&#x27;s easier to produce them in the nickel system than it is in the padium system but it depends on how you go about doing it too I mean there&#x27;s the electrolytic technique is very difficult whereas the ultrasonic loading technique is much easier so it depends upon how you put the hydrogen or the detarium into the metal and it depends upon what the metal is another entrepreneur and scientists who is not waiting for the debate to be decided is Randall Mills of black light power in New Jersey his hydr catalysis process is based on his attempts to resolve problems that remain in quantum mechanics which had concerned even Albert Einstein in early 1999 blacklight announced the discovery of an entirely new class of remarkable hydrogen compounds called hydrino hydrides which have proved real would support Dr Mill&#x27;s Theory while avoiding the label of cold f Fusion mil has attracted large scale funding and created a company that is positioning itself to be a leading manufacturer in the new energy age some of our better experiments with the electrolytic cell have generated as much as 1,000% excess heat for example if we put one watt into the cell we will get 10 watts out and that with that kind of heat we know know that there is something going on and it&#x27;s not simply an experimental error there was no other source for this heat other than some unknown process people are stunned by by mills&#x27;s work even though he insisted that it was not cold fusion uh I was one of the people who tended to believe there might be something there I was impressed from the beginning by mills&#x27;s credentials the fact that he was a Harvard graduate and had taken courses at MIT so I thought it was worth investigating and um I believe fairly early on that Mills was indeed uh doing coal Fusion just as other people were so that the Mills effect if you will the light water effect was really just the other side of the coin from the uh padium heavy water effect that ponds and flashmen are getting every now and then a freelance cold fusion scienti that shows up on the scene with a device that offers great promise only to be found lacking when put to the test by other scientists but what if a breakthrough device does in fact exactly what its maker says it should do repeatedly before trained independent eyes this vessel is sitting here making as we watch helium 4 and the temperature is 25° Centigrade now this is a very novel concept that you can have a nuclear fusion occur at 215 centigrade and one atmospheric pressure those are very very mild conditions compared to what they&#x27;re doing in the plasma fusion and in the hbomb and so forth I discovered that using certain standard commercial catalysts one could get this Fusion to occur under reproducible mild conditions and as I say this is the key you change this just a little bit it doesn&#x27;t work so inside this vessel now for six seven weeks we have had dorium fusing to helium 4 and giving this excess temperature of about 35° Centigrade which is Big a really big effect now in the bottom of this vessel which is heated in this jacket there&#x27;s about 40 or 50 grams of padium on activated carbon Catalyst and this run is now continuing and and maybe will continue for some weeks or months still the idea is to test the reliability of the Catalyst the Catalyst must must work for some months or it&#x27;s not a viable commercial process this experiment very much follows along the thought process of less case and behind me you see uh five different uh sets of apparatus uh the big vessel here is one of less cases uh calls them footballs it&#x27;s a stainless steel vessel on a heating mantle uh set up in exactly the arrangement that Les case himself is doing in New Hampshire on the monitor you see displayed in fact the Mass Spectrum from one of these uh samples this is a relatively high level of uh of helium four We compare the samples each day that we perform the analysis We compare the sample of gas from the various uh active cells and blanks with a sample of room air uh which we have measured many many times and know to be 5.22 parts of per million if the helium is produced by a nuclear process then necessarily there will be an Associated release of heat it appears that uh yes indeed uh in the vessel that was producing helium there was some evidence of excess heat and that the amount of heat produced was approximately uh quantitatively correlated that is the right amount of heat was produced uh compared to that of a nuclear process involving uh deeron plus deeron producing uh one helium for nucleus which releases 23.8 million electron volts my objective always has been not to play around scientifically because I&#x27;m not really a physicist but to head towards commercialization and I really want to go to 100 megawatt reactors maybe in two or three years which is really compressing the time scale but it&#x27;s may be possible so the idea is to scale it up the technology of catalytic Fusion developed by Dr Les case is one of the most extraordinary developments we have in the cold fusion field he has excess heat massive excess heat repeatable excess heat clear null results and also helium 4 production production of the very nuclear Ash that the opponents of coal Fusion uh demanded in the early days now we have it in Spades it appears as though he is very close to having a self-sustaining device that will keep hot by itself generate steam hot water perhaps electricity before much longer now we an experimentalist who has pioneered another promising cold fusion method sonoc cavitation is Dr Roger Stringham of first gate energies using ultrasound frequency Stringham has observed extraordinarily high temperatures caused by the process of cavitation where microscopic bubbles in water tunnel their way into Target Metals metals like silver titanium padium and platinum are melted by intense heat created during the brief moment it takes for a bubble to [Music] collapse well this is a cavitation process going on in the bubble and the acoustic energy is absorbed uh by the liquid and there is a certain point in which it creates small voids which actually grow and then collapse very rapidly and that is the cavitation idea the temperatures that are required to create these EC toyes are at least the melting point of the metal and it looks like we are actually in the vapor phase which is gaseous metal and this amounts to for the liquid metal is 1600° Kelvin and and for titanium higher for the vaporous state is several thousand degrees higher than that Stringham is seeking to commercialize his device for use as a homeow multiplier that can supplement conventional electric power usage [Music] transmuting base Metals into new more refined elements was once the long sought after effect of the medial
