            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up veters? Patrick here with Vetted. Today we are talking about this. &gt;&gt; Just listen to this soundbite. Watch. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t like to characterize necessarily where they came from.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re definitely some kind of non-human sentience. &gt;&gt; Dave Grush is a friend of mine and he&#x27;s a source and I&#x27;ve known him for 3 years. I was texting him in the green room. I said, &quot;What can I tell Megan&#x27;s audience?&quot; He said, &quot;The problem with the aliens is that we care a lot about them, but they don&#x27;t care a lot about us. All right, veters, please hit that like button.</p>
<p>That really helps out the videos. And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button. All right, veter. So, what is this video about today? Well, it&#x27;s about this gentleman named Walter Kern who is a political journalist, I guess I would say, and he did this interview with Megan Kelly, right, at this live show, and he basically said some things that David Grush told him he could say right on stage. Well, that&#x27;s interesting because this totally is a departure from things normally David Grush has said.</p>
<p>And there&#x27;s way more to what Walter Kern had to say, and we&#x27;re going to be covering all of it. Now, if you&#x27;re wondering who Walter Kern is, well, he is a journalist, like I said, who actually wrote an article about David Grush 3 years ago in a newspaper called The County Highway. It&#x27;s called the Republic of Accluded Facts. CH exclusive interview with UFO whistleblower Dave Grush reveals black projects saps NHIS and our top Hollywood executives aliens by Walter Kern. Well, that seems like a serious article.</p>
<p>So, that&#x27;s basically just to give you an idea where Walter Kern began his relationship with David Grush. Now, I&#x27;m going to put a link down below to the article so you can read it if you want. Um, it hasn&#x27;t been covered very much to be honest and it&#x27;s actually one of the very first things I ever covered on vetted many years ago and since then Walter Kern has blocked me on Twitter for no reason at all. It&#x27;s like out of nowhere I&#x27;ll just see that I&#x27;m blocked by people. So kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Um, but anyway, let&#x27;s jump into this video. The other thing that you and I have talked about recently that is back in the news is the possibility of other life forms here on Earth. This is it just my feed or is this coming up in your your social media and like your life more these days? Okay. No, it&#x27;s just me. Okay.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m in news and I talk to Walter, so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening. Well, my old pal Brett Bear over on Fox News just did this interview. Okay. Yes, we like Brett. And um he interviewed like the god of UAPs.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what they call them now. &gt;&gt; What used to be called UFOs. Yes. They got an upgrade. &gt;&gt; Former Air Force guy.</p>
<p>Just listen to this sound bite. Watch. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t like to characterize necessarily where they came from. They&#x27;re definitely some kind of nonhuman sentience. But it is true.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, we&#x27;ve recovered the vehicles. Um and we actually have physical proof. And I was actually uh partially cleared into some of those activities. It was beyond uh oral testimony provided to me. I actually had partial access uh to the data and actually read the intelligence reports uh resulting from those programs.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; With your own eyes, you saw it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, that&#x27;s extraordinary because my my understanding is this is not some cook. This is not some crackpot.</p>
<p>This is a former air force. And he&#x27;s saying he actually saw the vehicles and some sort of nonscentient being. &gt;&gt; No sentient beings. Non-scentient beings are Jasmine Crockett. S sentient beings have awareness and thought.</p>
<p>Um, all right. There&#x27;s way more to cover in this video, so stay with me. But I got to keep the mics on, so let me thank the Pen Dragon Cycle for sponsoring today&#x27;s video. The new trailer for The Pen Dragon Cycle just dropped and I&#x27;m reacting to it. From the visionary mind of Steven R.</p>
<p>Lawhead comes the Pen Dragon cycle. A breathtaking new series that finally fills the aching void in epic fantasy. This is our Theory and Legend Reborn. Not the familiar tale of the king, but the origin story that started it all. Shot with jaw-dropping cinematic scope, every frame feels like a big budget theatrical event.</p>
<p>Sweeping landscapes, colossal battles that thunder across the screen, practical sets and costumes so authentic you can almost smell the mist and iron, and magic that crackles with raw tangible power. This is high fantasy at its most immersive. A vast livedin world dripping with history, prophecy, and ancient bloodlines. The attention to detail is staggering. The atmosphere is thick enough to touch.</p>
<p>The Pen Dragon Cycle isn&#x27;t just a series. It&#x27;s the foundation of the entire Arththeran saga. Told on a scale we haven&#x27;t seen in a long time. If you&#x27;ve been starving for a new fantasy epic that looks, feels, and hits like a cinematic masterpiece, this is it. The king is coming.</p>
<p>The cycle begins now. Pen Dragon Cycle: Rise of the Merlin premieres exclusively on Daily Wire Plus January 22nd, 2026. Please click the link in the description to watch the full trailer now. All right, so I have two more clips for you to show. So stay with me.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s jump into this next clip where Walter Kern is going to reveal everything that David Grush told him he could say right at this live show. And I&#x27;m going to show you how it&#x27;s a departure from what David Grush normally says. But this is something you&#x27;ve been reporting on. You&#x27;ve been paying attention to. &gt;&gt; So, in the in the spirit of Charlie Kirk, I decided I would do nothing but tell the truth when I came out here tonight.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I was invited to be on his show a couple of months before he died and I declined. That should give everybody pause. Take every opportunity you have with good people uh because they might not be around forever. Uh Dave Grush is a friend of mine and he&#x27;s a source and I&#x27;ve known him for three years. I was texting him in the green room.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;What can I tell Megan&#x27;s audience? He said, &quot;The problem with the aliens is that we care a lot about them, but they don&#x27;t care a lot about us.&quot; In other words, we&#x27;re still exploring this universe. The the gorilla was only discovered in the middle of the 19th century. It was a it was a mythical being that they finally discovered in the jungle. They found bodies and so on. I&#x27;m convinced and I hate to tell you this that Dave is telling the truth and that against great pressure uh and great mockery he&#x27;s trying to describe our actual world to us.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a world in which we have not made all the discoveries yet. Now uh he often compares them to mountain lions. He says, &quot;Do you believe in mountain lions?&quot; Everybody would say yes. Right? How many of you actually seen one? &gt;&gt; I have seen one. You&#x27;ve seen one &gt;&gt; in Montana.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, &gt;&gt; ugly. &gt;&gt; I am I am convinced that this isn&#x27;t a scop. That this isn&#x27;t what conspiracy theorists call project blue beam, an attempt to dazzle us all with a false god that will bring us all under, you know, slavery of some sort of world government. I think that very rarely, but somewhat commonly over the years going back through human history, we have been visited by beings of other types.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a big universe, one we barely understand. We&#x27;re very young. We&#x27;re going to learn about I I can promise you this. We&#x27;re going to learn more about this. And in the same interview, he tells you that Donald Trump knows a lot about it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s my information, too. If you know anything about Donald Trump, he can&#x27;t a he he will not avoid bragging about what he knows before he That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; So, so I expect him to be the president who tells us what we haven&#x27;t heard. &gt;&gt; All right. So, the very first part of that clip is a little interesting, right? People are saying, &quot;Oh, David Grush never calls them aliens.</p>
<p>He always calls them non-human sentience.&quot; Well, that&#x27;s kind of true, but kind of not. So, he has called them aliens before. Well, sort of. Take a look at this clip back from 2023 before he ever came out publicly. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re saying that the United States government has retrieved alien technology? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>The assessment was non-human, presumably extraterrestrial, but we do have retrieved non-human material and craft that we have in our possession. &gt;&gt; Do we have alien bodies? &gt;&gt; We do. So, he has kind of said aliens or at least he&#x27;s responded to the question of aliens. He even did it in his testimony where Nancy Mace asked him, &quot;So, we have alien bodies, you know, but so he is sort of responding to the word aliens, right? acknowledging that that&#x27;s what it is. Now, he doesn&#x27;t use that word now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all non-human, non-human sentience, non-human intelligence. It&#x27;s like they just keep changing it. Went from non-human intelligence to non-human sentience. I I don&#x27;t really know what what is happening here, but the words that they use are chosen very carefully. So, for whatever reason, that word is interesting now.</p>
<p>And I have a feeling that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to start to be being used, right? Just like we went from UFOs to UAP, we went from aliens to non-human intelligence to non-human sentience. So, I you know, I don&#x27;t know. But the other part is like, you know, they don&#x27;t care about us, right? What? We don&#x27;t even know who they are. How do we know what they&#x27;re doing? What are we talking about? Right? This is just makes no sense to me if I&#x27;m being honest. And even David Gush in that clip that they showed, he&#x27;s like, I don&#x27;t really like to talk about, you know, them that way, right? And then he goes ahead and tells Walter Kern that he can say that in front of Megan Kelly.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know, just kind of interesting to me. And what&#x27;s funny about that gorilla comment that Walter says, like it is true that they scientifically discovered gorillas in 1830s or something around there, but people were talking about gorillas before that. It wasn&#x27;t a myth. People were writing about it in books for hundreds of years before that, right? So, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s whatever. But that&#x27;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And Walter is right that in that same interview, you know, David Grush talks about how, you know, Donald Trump knows about this and all of this stuff. That&#x27;s part of the Age of Disclosure documentary, too, that everyone&#x27;s talking about, right? Donald Trump&#x27;s going to be coming out and giving a press conference and saying some stuff. Now that the movie&#x27;s out, I guess the clock is ticking. And even Walter Kern&#x27;s sources are saying that too, right? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard too, right? It&#x27;s like, what are they going to do if Donald Trump never says anything? You think they&#x27;re going to go after Donald Trump? I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be some excuse of why he&#x27;s not doing it, right? They&#x27;ll probably blame all the debunkers and skeptics as the reason um right or scientists or there&#x27;s always blaming someone else of why disclosure never happens, right? Except the people that make claims with no evidence. Let&#x27;s leave them alone.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s not Let&#x27;s not blame them. Let&#x27;s not question them. What&#x27;s also interesting is that Walter Kern, who hosts a podcast with Matt Taibbe, said about a year ago that Dick Cheney was at the top of the UFO pyramid, right? The leader, the one behind it all. And who told him that? David Grush. I talked to a highlevel UFO whistleblower last year.</p>
<p>And I said to him, who among all the people in society is keeping this secret? Who sits at top the pyramid of classified information about UFOs? And I thought he was going to say something strange like the Grandmason of the, you know, Scottish right lodge or Prince Charles or the MSAD, but he said Dick Cheney. Oh my goodness. Why does that not surprise me though? &gt;&gt; Uh because because of course he would be, right? &gt;&gt; So, okay, let&#x27;s check in with Dick Cheney. What does he have to say? &gt;&gt; Good morning. We are coming on the air with breaking news.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Dick Cheney has died at the age of 84. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. I guess Dick Cheney is gone. Did the whole disclosure thing happen? Right. If he&#x27;s not at the top of the pyramid running things, who who is, right? What&#x27;s going on? Does that mean anything? I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Is now Donald Trump going to say something because Dick Cheney is no longer with us? Who took over? &gt;&gt; Can you just like outline it for us more clearly? Like what exactly is he telling you? They&#x27;ve seen &gt;&gt; they&#x27;ve recovered craft that uh have crashed. Some of those craft have fought each other. In other words, they people say, &quot;How could they crash? They come across the universe.&quot; Well, we&#x27;re not so sure they&#x27;d come all that far. Frankly, we&#x27;re not so sure they don&#x27;t have places nearby to come visit. They&#x27;re a little bit like gardeners from the descriptions of the people I&#x27;ve had as sources.</p>
<p>They check on the garden every once in a while, but they have their own business. They have their own family fights. They have their own voyages. Now, what he&#x27;s talking about are actual bodies on the ground. I imagine there&#x27;s going to be a day where you&#x27;re going to sit down in front of your television and people who you trust, scientists, politicians, ones who don&#x27;t necessarily agree on with each other on everything, but do agree on something like the truth will bring forward the evidence.</p>
<p>You will be convinced. It will not rock your world. If you&#x27;re a religious person, you can handle it. If you&#x27;ve read the Bible, there are all sorts of creatures in there who aren&#x27;t explained. If you believe that these are a demonic presence, I don&#x27;t think they are anymore than certain animals are.</p>
<p>But, you know, there was a time when we thought we were alone in the universe almost as a planet, that the sun revolved around us and so on. We survived the we survived the the revelation that it was the other way around. We&#x27;ll survive this. It&#x27;ll be interesting. Kids will be more interested in science.</p>
<p>Uh I think our universe will light up for us again. uh they&#x27;ve kept it to themselves for I think obvious reasons. Uh and I spoke to someone just recently. I said, &quot;How should they first disclose this?&quot; And he said, &quot;They should take the craft that they&#x27;ve reverse engineered that have capacities that you and I don&#x27;t know about and fly them over Phoenix.&quot; And in fact, that happened because the Phoenix Lights is one of the great UFO scares of all time, if you know about it. Um, so, so I I predict that&#x27;s going to happen and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be all that long and I don&#x27;t and I think after all the movies and all the, you know, uh, pop culture, we&#x27;re not going to be all that shocked by it.</p>
<p>I think we&#x27;ll integrate it and, uh, it&#x27;s not going to destroy our civilization to find out. &gt;&gt; I have an idea for them to integrate into the United States in a way and the world, the earth that&#x27;s going to make everybody really happy. It&#x27;s going to make things non-controversial. People are going to be in favor of their addition to our way of life. They just have to start by grabbing one of us.</p>
<p>I I nominate Elizabeth Warren. Just you take her. She&#x27;s gone. She probably was part of that Hopey tribe at your high school. &gt;&gt; Then we can all get behind that idea.</p>
<p>Another unifier. &gt;&gt; The problem with if Trump announces it, the liberals won&#x27;t believe him. I mean, Trump could lay out absolute proof of this thing and uh half of the people wouldn&#x27;t believe it. Just like, you know, they went and grabbed Tylenol the minute it seemed like he was against it. &gt;&gt; I love how Walter&#x27;s just talking from a place of we, you know, we we don&#x27;t know where they come from.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t we this, we that, we that. Like, he&#x27;s with the group behind the scenes and getting all the secrets and he knows everything of what&#x27;s happening. Like, what are we talking about here? We just said we don&#x27;t know any we don&#x27;t know anything about it. What are we talking about? Right? In the age of disclosure documentary, they clearly state we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from. In fact, it&#x27;s even admitted by Luis Alazardo that they could be human.</p>
<p>So, why are we calling them non-human sentients? Why are we calling them aliens? Why are we saying they don&#x27;t like us? Where are we getting this information? You know, if I was Walter Kern, you know what I would ask David Grush? Why are you say that? Right? What proof or evidence do you have that they don&#x27;t care about us? And when you say they just one species, multiples, like what are we talking about? This is all theory that he&#x27;s throwing out that they, you know, don&#x27;t get along, they have their own thing going on, this that. I mean, we all speculate about that stuff. What do aliens doing on these secret bases, uh, you know, underwater, under a mountain or all this stuff that people talk about, there&#x27;s alien bases? I&#x27;ve asked those same question myself. What do they do all day? What the hell do they do all day at these bases? Are they hanging out? They with their families? They eating dinner? They&#x27;re watching movies, you know? I don&#x27;t know. Oh, they got a little band they they play on the weekends, little karaoke.</p>
<p>Like, I get it. But that&#x27;s just speculation, right? There&#x27;s no proof or evidence of any of this stuff that Walter&#x27;s saying, at least not made to the public. Has he seen these things or is he asking his source slashfriend about these things? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s all said with such certainty, right, that we&#x27;re just supposed to believe it. We just we just take it in. Let&#x27;s just believe it.</p>
<p>But hey, as Walter Cern is saying, we&#x27;re going to find out one day. We&#x27;re all going to know and we&#x27;ll all be convinced with the evidence and proof. But what if that doesn&#x27;t happen? What if that mountain lion never comes out of the mountain? And of course, he has to get political there at the end, right? um you know this is supposed to be a bipartisan issue and I just hate when we&#x27;re talking aliens and UFOs and people just like have to get political but I guess he is a political journalist so kind of makes sense but still can we at least make the UFOs not you know bipartisan again that&#x27;s what age of disclosure is about right are you telling me that left-wing liberals and by the way I&#x27;m not political in any way I hate every side of politics up down, left, right, inside, outside. I don&#x27;t care. I hate it all.</p>
<p>Right. Are we telling me You&#x27;re telling me that only conservative right-wing people will accept aliens and leftws will deny it? I mean, what are we talking about? That that just doesn&#x27;t make sense. I get it. It&#x27;s probably just a joke, but still, let&#x27;s keep politics out of aliens and UFOs, please. All right.</p>
<p>So, before we go, I do want to address a comment that I got recently on a video um about my review of The Age of Disclosure. And someone left a really great comment that I&#x27;d like to address. Okay, Patrick, I understand your skepticism and I truly respect you. But let me ask you something. Is your documentary going to show 100% proof and evidence or is it just going on trusting you and your guest on the documentary? Just asking.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s a fair question to ask because I was very critical of the age of disclosure and all the claims they made in the film absolutes, right, with zero evidence or proof. Well, let me answer your question, Robert. The documentary I&#x27;m a part of that&#x27;s coming out soon called Psionics is not about proving or disproving anything. I went out as an objective filmmaker to film people who claimed to have special abilities and I was just a mirror, right? So everything you&#x27;re going to see in the documentary is just a mirror, a reflection of what was shown and said to me, but we weren&#x27;t trying to prove it or disprove it. That&#x27;s not what my documentary is about at all.</p>
<p>Right? The age of disclosure is a different kind of documentary. Dan Farah believes heavily, he&#x27;s not objective about this at all. is absolutely convinced that the things he&#x27;s showing in his film are true. Mine isn&#x27;t like that. Mine&#x27;s an old school documentary.</p>
<p>Again, I&#x27;m a mirror. I went up. I reflected back what was said and shown to me and you decide for yourself, right? Other people make claims in the film and they try to show me things. I experience some things I can&#x27;t explain. But in no way do I definitively say it&#x27;s this or it&#x27;s that and this is what&#x27;s happening.</p>
<p>Right? My documentary is just so different. In fact, I don&#x27;t know if the UFO community is ready for the documentary I&#x27;m going to release. People won&#x27;t know where to fit it because most people have an agenda when they make a UFO documentary. They come from the standpoint of this is real and let me show you why or this is and let me show you why. Ours didn&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>So, I hope that answers your question, Robert. It was a really good question and I respect that question a lot and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be answering that more when the film comes out and have to do promotion and press for it. So, no problem. Happy to answer that and maybe people will feel differently when they see it. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But I definitely expect people to review it, hate it, love it, everything in between. All good, right? All I hope is that it opens the conversation and makes people think for themselves. All right, betterers. We&#x27;ll see you guys on the next one. And remember, everyday is a gift.</p>
<p>Yeah. Peace. &gt;&gt; Hey, Patrick. Uh, my name is Paul. I&#x27;m ringing from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Uh, love your podcast, mate. Um, all good. Uh, I was looking forward to the Age of Disclosure and and then I saw who was in it and I kind of thought, oh no, I thought maybe this is a misinformation thing with um our friend Mr. Alzando. And then when I heard um Mr.</p>
<p>cult talking about it. I thought, &quot;Oh, this might be all just the big another one of those um stories where we don&#x27;t actually get the truth.&quot; And yeah, it kind of seemed that way. I mean, it was a good movie, but um yeah. Um I&#x27;d like to tell you about my UFO experience. So, 1997, I was on a school trip here in New Zealand and we stayed overnight at this campsite.</p>
<p>uh was on a geography trip and we stayed at the campsite and then um we were up about 1:00 in the morning and from the southeast this object um came flying over the hill pretty slowly uh about the sort of speed of a of an airliner I suppose um but it was like a rectangle shape uh it was black and it had uh lights underneath it so quite bright white lights was a row 4x3 and there was one light in the center at the front and it just moved moved above us um heading in a northwest direction. And that&#x27;s my UFO story. Uh cheers Patrick and um cheers to the VA team. See you guys.</p>
