            <p>[Music] [Music] in the heart of the dark and dense  Bavarian forests where Mists cloak the trees like   a thick shroud lies a forgotten mind during World  War II this place was known only to a select few   and even now its existence is veiled in mystery  Legend has it that deep within this mine the   Nazis were developing something so Sinister and  Powerful that it was spoken of only in Whispers   in 1942 as German forces retreated on all fronts </p>
<p>despair in the Nazi headquarters reached its peak   it was then that a mysterious scientist Dr ghard  Fogle presented an offer that promised them the   chance to win the wa Dr Vogal whose eyes burned  with mad determination claimed to have found a   way to manipulate time this inventor notorious  for his dark reputation and passion for occult   research had developed a prototype machine  known as D Glock this massive construction of   metal and glass resembled a giant Bell emitting </p>
<p>an ear hum when activated inside the Bell were   two rings rotating in opposite directions at a  terrifying speed on one Grim November evening   as the moon cast a Sinister light over the mine  Dr vogle decided to conduct the first experiment   several high ranking SS officers gathered around  their faces obscured by Shadows When de glocka was   activated the air in the mine thickened and glowed  with with a pale violet light suddenly a piercing   scream echoed and darkness enveloped everything </p>
<p>when the light returned Dr vogle stood in the   middle of the mine his eyes empty and his face  contorted with horror he screamed of demons from   other times of Shadows that had taken his soul  the officers who witnessed the experiment were   never seen again in the following months rumors of  De Glock began to spread it was said that the na   tried to use it to transport their troops to  the future or to alter the past to change the   course of the war but every time the machine was </p>
<p>activated it brought only chaos and death people   vanished bodies were torn apart and time and  space twisted and distorted One Night in April   1945 as the Reich crumbled the mine was sealed  Dr vogle and several of his assistants stayed   inside to conduct conduct one last experiment  it was their final hope their last chance to   save Germany but when the machine was activated  everything went terribly wrong an explosion as   powerful as a small nuclear blast shook the Earth </p>
<p>the mine collapsed burying everyone inside many   years passed the mine was forgotten overgrown by  the forest and became part of local folklore it   was said that on moonlit nights one could hear  the distant hum of De Glock and the shadows in   the forest were those taken by the machine from  different times in 2022 amid the onset of a new   large and bloody war a group of researchers  inspired by rumors and old documents decided   to find the mine and uncover the mystery of D </p>
<p>Glock armed with modern equipment and full of   determination they treed through the dense forest  and found the Forgotten mine inside it was cold   and dark the air thick with fear when they reached  the depths of the mine they were met with a scene   Frozen in Time the machine still stood there  encased in ice and frost its presence still   inspiring dread suddenly one of the researchers  drawn by an unseen Force activated dig Glock   the Mind filled with a pale violet light the air </p>
<p>thickened and the Eerie hum returned this moment   triggered even greater and more terrifying events  the explosion of D glock&#x27;s energy tore the fabric   of time causing catastrophic changes in reality  Darkness consumed everything the researchers   vanished and the mind once again fell silent Only  The Echoes of dark Whispers and screams remained   and daglock continued to spin like an eternal  guardian of its Secrets thus the mine remains   a grim reminder that some secrets of the past </p>
<p>are better left undisturbed this activation led   to destruction to the start of a war that brought  even more suffering and pain the mysteries of D   Glock proved too dangerous for Humanity and now  this place will forever guard its dark secrets</p>
