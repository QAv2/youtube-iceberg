            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Well, can we uh do an elemental analysis of it? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But right now, what&#x27;s happening is we&#x27;re bombarding the surface with X-rays and determining the energy levels of the electrons in the material itself to help define what elements are present. &gt;&gt; Okay. When we did our own similar scans back at the ranch, we were surprised to see elements like nickel, cobalt, and thorium, which you don&#x27;t usually see in ceramics. So, we wanted to confirm the content with this lab&#x27;s much more sophisticated equipment.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is the analysis of the exterior of the sample. &gt;&gt; So, this is just the elemental makeup of this sample on the surface versus the interior. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this shows some more elements than what we saw on the ranch. We got um carbon, oxygen are the two most prevalent.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And then you&#x27;ve got the next most prevalent silicon and then uh the next one is magnesium or aluminum. They&#x27;re real close to each other. And then calcium and then iron. The amount of carbon is really interesting.</p>
<p>I was not expecting that. &gt;&gt; Quite a bit. And you know that&#x27;s one of the main ingredients of stealth material. I&#x27;ve actually made it before. Covered a pickup truck with it once and made it invisible to police radar.</p>
<p>We used charcoal which is your carbon and aluminum binding agent and basically spray glue. And so that&#x27;s one of the main ingredients used for radar cloaking technology by the military. Since World War II, our military has been developing stealth material to make our fighter jets and other craft invisible to radar detection and even to the naked eye in some cases. Could this be the same type of material? And could that be what this material was used for? &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean as far as what is in the mesa? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Can we do an elemental interior of a scan? &gt;&gt; Definitely.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the exterior of this material is made of, we need to know if those elements will remain consistent inside of it, too. Or maybe we&#x27;ll find even more surprises. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So, this is a purely interior scan.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got oxygen, silicon, uh there is some magnesium, there&#x27;s a calcium line, we&#x27;ve got potassium, &gt;&gt; some iron, a lot of aluminum this time. No carbon this time. So the interior doesn&#x27;t have carbon in it. That I mean the interior is clearly a different material than the exterior. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This material is a lot like a sponge or maybe an umbrella. One material on the outside for protection with another one on the inside for some different purpose. How do you make this material that&#x27;s hard on the outside &gt;&gt; but sponge-like on the inside? Yeah, I get it. &gt;&gt; And to what end? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it could be the exterior hole or protective layer of something, you know, to to protect it from a harsh environment. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I keep coming back to this is a lot like the ceramic tiles for the space shuttle. I don&#x27;t know yet what we&#x27;ve got here, but I can&#x27;t help making comparisons between this ceramic material and the ceramic tiles on the space shuttle for a couple of reasons. Space shuttle tiles are designed to protect the shuttle from extreme heat up to 3,000° F when they reenter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. They&#x27;re made of coated silica ceramics that are very light but able to absorb extreme amounts of heat. There are similar elements in the makeup of the ceramics that came out of the mesa, but their interior is different and the way they responded to the scanning electron microscope was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>What that means, we just don&#x27;t know yet. &gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;ve never seen anything with this content that behaves this way that was a naturally occurring material. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s natural. I would agree. This is definitely something engineered.</p>
<p>So that means somebody built it and it was built for a a purpose. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Now our our goals are to find out what that purpose is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So how does a manufactured piece of material with these kind of exotic properties exist and what the hell was this material doing in the mason? &gt;&gt; Oh no, Brandon.</p>
<p>How did it get there? That&#x27;s what I want to know because I tell you where it didn&#x27;t come from. It didn&#x27;t come from any modern-day ceramics lab that I know</p>
