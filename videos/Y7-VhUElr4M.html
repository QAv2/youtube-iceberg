            <p>[Music] hi there my name is Matthew Carson with the Open Source Energy Network we&#x27;re very excited to be bringing these testimonies before you today but first of all we&#x27;d like to thank the disclosure project the disclosure project has spent a couple years and over a quarter million dollars acquiring these exceptional energy testimonies from trailblazers in the clean free renewable energy field these testimonies are testimonies they aren&#x27;t simply interviews they&#x27;re been documented with affidavits and documented credentials these people have important things to say about the current state of energy as it is in the world today please listen carefully watch carefully share these videos disperse them amongst your friends email the links around but make sure to donate directly to the disclosure project today and keep in mind that these are not fictional interviews or showbiz articles these are testimonies that we hope and the disclosure project hopes will eventually stand in a court of law thank you I studied physics at Johns Hopkins for my BA degree and then I got a master&#x27;s in business administration at the University of shocked Chicago I got my PhD after that at Portland State University in system science which was an interdisciplinary program and my thesis dealt with a range of both astronomy and geology area studying a new phenomenon of how the galactic center can affect the earth through cosmic ray volleys my interest in electrogravitics which is Towson Brown&#x27;s work began in 1985 I was interested because the physics theory I had been working on predicted a coupling between electricity and gravitation which is pretty much what Braun was illustrating experimentally in particularly let&#x27;s say in the standard physics theory with like general relativity which is our current theory of gravitation but you have only one polarity to gravity so masses can only attract you know there&#x27;s no possibility for gravitational repulsion or anti-gravity anything the physicist comes up with that as sort of speculating outside of that framework there physicists have proposed that there might be some coupling between electricity and gravitation at very high energies and that&#x27;s one of their reasons for building these huge particle colliders is they&#x27;re hoping to find this connection if they just look before their eyes the experimental evidence there is a connection but it just left normal laboratory voltages that you can generate brown-headed kind of a maypole that he built with two disks that he would charge the disks and the leading edge of each disk had a wire that would emit positive ions and the body of the disc was negatively charged can you see that is it sure and he he would charge an initial experiment this type that you see here he charged with 50,000 volts about 50 watts of power and this would spin around around 12 miles per hour in this circuit and then he is reported to have done a similar thing but larger on a 50 foot course charging to 150,000 volts and these were going several hundred miles per hour so if you can picture about like model airplane speed model airplanes can go several hundred miles an hour and this was done something around 1953 in Pearl Harbor and it demonstrated to some top brass from military and the subject is reported to have become classified after that they were so impressed with the results some people have said well this is due to iron propulsion that the ions coming off of the front of the craft somehow blow the craft and cause it to move and there have been experiments done to show this is not the case in fact braun tested his idea in a vacuum so there was eliminating the idea of ions and it&#x27;s actually went to work better in a vacuum and now with i was interested because i I could explain this with my theory basically that the positive charges would create gravitational wells just like our current concept of a gravitational well around a massive object whereas electrons would would do the opposite they create gravity hills which in effect you&#x27;d say is it a gravitational repulsion effect and so if you look at Browns disk according to my theory you get a G a gravity potential Hill G Hill and towards the negative charged end of the craft energy well towards the positive and so there be an effect of gravitational gradient created across that which would tend to propel it forward well I know that in 52 he put on a demonstration to the Office of Naval Research it&#x27;s kind of interesting that why would they end up classifying a whole project his whole concept year later if there wasn&#x27;t this Syria take this approach to take him seriously okay well I believe that there are many ways to create a gravitational effects or at least the approaches i&#x27;ve seen i&#x27;ve heard of are quite different it&#x27;s like various ways to skin the cat I guess Brown was using high voltage charge and it appears that that technology is used on the b2 yeah it involves using a maser in this case this is a this would be a different approach than what Brown was doing this is using microwaves to create pushes be able to push on a distant surface Apple retracing the path of the incoming ways this is a very well known technology in the area of optics and it&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of literature on it in throw use and let with lasers but you find nothing in the air of microwaves and I believe the reason it&#x27;s very highly classified because of its ability to be used for UFO propulsion and the beauty of this is that the microwaves stay in the beam they don&#x27;t scatter out that&#x27;s the nature of it so you pump up your beam and effect with energy and it&#x27;s not lost it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re putting your energy into a tube it&#x27;s a resonator and so in effect you could create a craft it&#x27;s standing on poles they affect become like solid poles between the craft and round and this is how the for example the tr-3b there&#x27;s some talk about this using anti-gravity technology has three thrusters on the bottom well this is what the thrusters would be there have been triangular UFOs the tr-3b is one of the triangular shaped UFOs that we&#x27;ve heard about the the UFOs that may be of alien origin disc shaped and some of them may be some that we have created ourselves probably use this technology you often see three dome domes underneath I believe these are actually microwave transmitters for the beans I think Robert Lazar has spoken about his experience with few of these devices at area 51 my first exposure to [Music] discovery that this anti-gravity research was quite a big area not talked about very much but it was it was a major endeavor by major aerospace corporations this came from this report electrolytic systems which I found very revealing this is a photocopy the way I came about this report I was at the Library of Congress looking under gravitation to see if there was anything closely remotely touching on the subject of electrogravitics which I had at that time in 1985 just become acquainted with its existence through some articles about Townsend Brown and there was only one card in the whole catalog which came close to this and this was about this report and it interestingly it was missing from the stacks and they had to do a search computer search to see where could there be another one and the fellow said this must be a very rare report says it&#x27;s only one other library in the whole US and I said where is that said wright-patterson Air Force Base so I went ahead and ordered it through an interlibrary loan request and it was surprised that they actually sent it the copy to me it&#x27;s actually a red this is red cardboard jacket and it&#x27;s bound the side and this was produced by a group called aviation studies International which is kind of a think-tank in London that produces intelligence reports and they&#x27;ve been in existence for earlier still in existence and this report was dated in 1956 and it was basically trying to encourage the aircraft industry to develop brown&#x27;s technology townsend brown&#x27;s electrogravitics technology with the idea of developing a mach 3 fighter craft or maybe even to commercialize it so we instead of taking jets we will fly much faster with electromagnetics and they did a survey the aviation industry at that time and they named some made aircraft companies I have here in my book sub quantum kinetics I take excerpts from this study and just name some companies it says here Glenn Martin it&#x27;s a former company named for Martin Marietta which is now merged then that&#x27;s a different name that said Glenn Martin now feels ready to say in public that they are examining the unified field theory to see what can be done and so on let&#x27;s see then further on says here companies studying the implications of gravity acts are said in a new statement to include Glenn Martin convair Sperry Rand Sikorsky Bell Lear and Clark electronics among companies who have previously evinced interest include Lockheed Douglas and Hiller and they were calling the people were writing this aviation studies report we&#x27;re calling for a manhattan-style project to develop this that this was going to change our whole aviation technology here that the then later in Businessweek magazine they listed an impressive array of companies and institutions backing gravity research just back in the 50s and that included martin grumman lockheed Sperry R and so on and also Hughes Aircraft should be added to the list I do believe that we have technology presently developed and which would allow us to easily navigate the solar system with that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we had bases on Mars and the moon we&#x27;re regularly going there with these kinds of crafts we have that ability let&#x27;s say there was a Roswell crash and they said that the National Security Agency was formed to keep this all classified now something like that it&#x27;s very emotional experience when suddenly your government officials and you realize that we&#x27;ve had content that there is extraterrestrial life and they have this advanced technology and when you&#x27;re become very emotional about something one of reaction is to hide it and then to see how can we use this for ourselves we&#x27;ve got to keep one step ahead of the other countries are at that time we had cold war with the Soviet Union so this was a rationale was to use it for military purposes now you know you can think back suppose suppose the same thing happened a hundred years ago at the time the automobile was developed I sincerely believe we&#x27;d still be driving horse and buggies today because it would be the fear that the automobile could change warfare it wouldn&#x27;t mean much higher speed travel and obviously we should classify this at that time there wasn&#x27;t the same mechanism in place for we didn&#x27;t have the NSA and this major program to contain advanced technologies we think of it as a science it&#x27;s a scientific discipline it&#x27;s based on observation and it&#x27;s open to change and one thing I&#x27;ve learned - I have my degree in physics from since 69 at that time I was thinking that it was that way that it was very objective science as you learn more about it and about the people but the scientists themselves you realize how much it is a religion it&#x27;s very closed to its resistive to changing its fundamental principles like it has relativity is one foundation the energy conservation laws and other key foundation for example in the Patent Office any chance of a new device coming that could help us to solve our energy crisis problem which has its getting its energy from someplace that the patent examiner doesn&#x27;t understand where it might be coming from he immediately thinks all this is in violation of the first law of thermodynamics which is one of the these principles the physicists have set up not thinking well maybe there is a source of energy that we just haven&#x27;t discovered right now it doesn&#x27;t necessarily fit into the physics framework instead of thinking that way they immediately reject it thinking well this fellow is a fraud or he did his measurements wrong and so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s a very religious feeling where the examiners have ascribed to a certain belief system and anything that challenges that they will deny its existence this was a case of a Canadian fellow who had developed a technology for producing enough power to power your house out of something about size of a shoebox it was a new way of wiring something up so some sort of nonlinear device and he was very open about it and publicizing it and trying to find investors to sell the rights and as I understand the story his house was one day surrounded by SWAT team and all his stuff was confiscated and he was arrested on the grounds that he was hard in terrorist technology or weaponry and he was released if he signs something that he would not continue doing work in this area and so now he&#x27;s mowing lawns for a living I mean this is kind of a very lame excuse for suppressing this kind of thing in my opinion if they are really that frightened about these new technologies they can always license them just like you licensed radio stations or whatever to keep tabs on it how much power produces for what purpose and I think our current crisis what energy is important enough that this is the least they can do instead of arresting people who are trying to help the world the way I had concluded that b2 may be using the electrogravitics technology Townsend Brown was through a article published in Aviation Week and space technology and there were some black project engineers who had disclosed to the editor of the magazine about some black project technology that they were aware of and one of the things they said was in relation to the b2 that the b2 charges the leading edge of its wing to a high voltage and its exhaust is charged to an opposite charge high voltage charge and they had given some explanations of how this would help for example soften the sonic boom if you charge the leading edge of the wing which is true in fact it&#x27;s one of the things that Brown had talked about also the exhaust they were saying how this helps cool exhaust and disguise the signature the infrared signature of exhaust which is also true they didn&#x27;t go further to explain the tie-in with electrogravitics and that&#x27;s the connection that I made I realized that this was an effect a description of townsend brown&#x27;s patented device which looked something like this in his patent which was issued in 1962 mm-hmm his electro kinetics patent and he was proposing a disc-shaped craft that would use what he called flame jet generators these are jet engines that have been converted into sort of giant Van de Graaff generators he was proposing that you could get develop actually 15 million volts through this technique in effect then the jet becomes your electrical generator to effect a high voltage electric generator and he was saying with that power you were able to feed the positive side of the generator to the front of your craft and generates your ions just like he was doing in those small disks that he was testing that we&#x27;re going hundreds of miles per hour except here you&#x27;re doing on a very large scale this is from sub quantum kinetics and it explains how a particle comes into beam okay because I&#x27;m the reason I&#x27;m talking about this now is that sub quantum kinetics allows for the possibility of materialization and dematerialization now but if you were to be able to raise this Jeep gee well so this a supercritical region this fertile region disappeared this particle theoretically would dematerialize would go back to the vacuum condition in relation to technology of spacecraft advanced technology there&#x27;s stories of how crap can actually dematerialize visually and so my theory about this is that they are able to affect the gravity field of the craft and cause this this is within the context of sub quantum kinetics is how I would think it would occur is that they are able to make the craft lighter in fact like arrays of gravity to make a G Hill there and the waves the formed particles would diminish go more towards the vacuum state there appears to be a process where the American Physical Society spokesman Robert Park makes fun of the new technology on his website make making sort of sarcastic comments about it or pointing out how it breaks certain laws of physics that are their codes of what they believe is valid and in effect creating the impression that this is a fraudulent idea that the some of these doing something illegal to be trying to sell this idea or patent and the case of blacklight they had longer than that against the inventor of this process who is able to get energy out of just plain water that glass of water would produce more energy than if you had that glass filled with gasoline which is what Mills is finding he&#x27;s finding ultraviolet light is given off during this transition and this is how he generates the energy and he has a catalyst is able to release this energy well he has made some patents on this and just as the one patent on this was about to issue was it has been actually announced and the patent gets that and was formally going to issue in a week or two robert park starts making fun of it on his website and apparently there must have been a email campaign or contact at the patent office it embarrassed the Patent Office and they pulled the patent which is really illegal what they did to withdraw a patent after I&#x27;ve been already approved to be issued because you&#x27;re according to patent law you&#x27;re only I&#x27;ll really vention is allowed to be patented if it works it and if it&#x27;s something new it can work and break the laws of physics as physicists know it and it still has the right to be patented time and again technology has driven physics theory physics theory tends to be restraining on technological advancement because all you would come up with is the ideas that your theory happened to predict now if that was the case our technological advance would slow to a halt so you the system fortunately our patent system is set up to allow us to go beyond the laws of physics to pass things that work and what the Patent Office in its current approach is it&#x27;s actually breaking the law is trying to make happy the physicists who are with American Physical Society to keep them in power with their ideas you might say and withhold from public use good inventions that could solve our problems like the energy crisis and well backlight power the company that has this invention is not taking this lightly and they have initiated court suit I think very strong possibility they&#x27;re going to win this case but you see this is not an isolated case is a whole pattern of this going on at the Patent Office I personally know because I was at the Patent Office for about a year and I know some people there and I know some of the things that we&#x27;re going on and for example there was somebody I know who issued a patent on a process of sending signals faster than the speed of light this was then made fun of by robert park on his website through their connections they had this posted somewhere is the most ridiculous patent of the Year award this sort of thing in effect they embarrassed the patent and shortly after this happened as embarrassing this embarrassing publicity occurred the Commission of the Patent Office reprimanded the examiner and his supervisor and he threatened to fire the supervisor so in effect trying to satisfy the this this lobby group that&#x27;s all you can call it it&#x27;s a lobby group that&#x27;s outside the government that has undue influence on the Patent Office and shouldn&#x27;t really be allowed to I mean they can say what they want the freedom of speech but for the Patent Office to do their bidding instead of following a law that is illegal and you you could argue just on the basis of viewing physics as a religion in a way a belief system that anything that challenges their belief system they&#x27;re gonna pose and they don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s going to help Society because it would make them look like fools that jeez they can&#x27;t explain this and maybe their theories are wrong people are going to start wondering why do we send our children to colleges why are these university professors getting funded to build huge accelerators which for what purpose you know why do we spend billions of dollars on the super collider in Texas and so there obviously must be a monetary connection here whether they&#x27;re trying to protect their butts for funding to and it&#x27;s self-interest you know and heck with the rest of the world you know that global warming happen if it doesn&#x27;t fit into our physics box that&#x27;s too bad you know effect these new technologies new energy technologies for example are the underdog you have to admit it they don&#x27;t fit into the paradigm that is currently taught and believed and sort of so they are left out of getting the funding to be developed or to get their paths that you&#x27;ve even to the point that they&#x27;re breaking a lot to prevent them from their paths from being issued without their patents being issued how our investor is going to invest in the company so we need a massive education program to edge the Patent Office on how how they should follow the laws that are breaking along and funding institutions like National Science Foundation Department of Energy to start funding thing we have to do in this state of crisis that we&#x27;re in because we see already with the oil problems and the high prices we heard about the melting of the Arctic the rise in temperature global warming effect these are real so we really have to start initiating this program as soon as possible this should be a major issue of concern for Congress the paradigm that we&#x27;re in that&#x27;s been taught in the it&#x27;s being taught in our universities and physics classes chemistry classes it&#x27;s fine for in the past and it&#x27;s done well but we&#x27;re at a point where we need to go beyond that we are we need technologies that don&#x27;t fit in that paradigm you</p>
