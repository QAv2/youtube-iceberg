            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Ask yourself this. Why would the CIA officials, astrophysicist, and former directors of national intelligence all come forward right now and all at the same time in the same film? And why would some of them suddenly abandon language and start talking in spiritual terms? The movie Age of Disclosure doesn&#x27;t just reveal UAPs and nonhuman craft. It reveals the next phase of the narrative. Because in this movie, top insiders go further than ever before, describing these beings in ways that sound less extraterrestrial and much more like earlier ancient generations. Some openly even calling them demonic.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the part no one wants to talk about. And tonight, we&#x27;re breaking it wide open. Let&#x27;s go. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re watching the big picture. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>You are watching the big picture. And I&#x27;m telling you, tonight is a very special episode. We are extremely excited to have you here tonight. It&#x27;s going to be a little bit different. We&#x27;re going to break down the new movie, The Age of Disclosure.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re going to have a special guest coming in uh later this in the show pretty soon, none other than La Marzuni. But right now, she&#x27;s not a guest. She is the co-host of The Big Picture. Show some love for the queen. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m coming in hot.</p>
<p>Little hot, but hot. Um, it has been a power-p packed, amazing, fast-paced, awesome day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it&#x27;s about to get even better. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s about to get even better, &gt;&gt; y&#x27;all.</p>
<p>We stepped up our game. We got the Star Force shirt on. &gt;&gt; Got the Area 51 shirt on. &gt;&gt; Space Force. &gt;&gt; Uh, what what&#x27; I say? Star Force.</p>
<p>Star Force. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m Okay. &gt;&gt; But look, we&#x27;re excited because tonight we have none other than La Marzulli is going to be coming in later. I mean, it&#x27;s crazy. I watched his uh take on the new movie, The Age of Disclosure, &gt;&gt; and I just called him and I said, &quot;Hey, man.</p>
<p>I know this is last minute.&quot; I said, &quot;We&#x27;re we&#x27;re watching it right now and uh we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to do a quick response to it.&quot; And uh and I said, &quot;I just started yours, so would you maybe come on or do a show later?&quot; And he said, &quot;Hey, for the big picture audience, I&#x27;ll do it tonight.&quot; So little bit later tonight live from somewhere in an undisclosed location in California &gt;&gt; somewhere on the west coast &gt;&gt; will be the none other than LA Marzulli. All right Sandy. So we&#x27;ve watched the program the age of disclosure. &gt;&gt; It was a quick watch. Didn&#x27;t get to get every little scene in, but uh yeah, it&#x27;s a lot.</p>
<p>You haven&#x27;t seen it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn&#x27;t get a chance to really break it down and analyze it like we we&#x27;re going to. We&#x27;re going to go back and watch it. Uh, by the way, if you want to watch it, it is on Amazon and it is the it&#x27;s the most expensive rental there is I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. It&#x27;s like $18.99 to rent it or like $22 to buy it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy it. &gt;&gt; So, we just bought it because we&#x27;re going we&#x27;re going to need to do some research. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and buy it. &gt;&gt; All right. So, what&#x27;s your hot take? uh you know, we&#x27;ve got some things, some bullet points that we&#x27;re going to talk about, but initially uh before we really dive deep into it and we&#x27;re going to fire the trailer in just a minute and some clips from it, but what was your gut feeling? Because like I said, you we were we did have a busy day.</p>
<p>We come in on two wheels. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; So, what was your initial take? &gt;&gt; Uh first of all, I would say information overload for me. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll feel the same, but it is a lot. It is just like a This is not some uh sit down with your coffee.</p>
<p>This is a fastpaced one person, one account after the next just pounding home the point that this is real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brace yourself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Your government is has kept this from you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what they say over and over &gt;&gt; for at least eight decades. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; At least. Well, it&#x27;s the strongest disclosure documentary ever released. I mean, I think wouldn&#x27;t you not say that that is it was definitely it&#x27;s got the most strongest language of anything we&#x27;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I enjoyed the Bob Lazar film from what, four or five years ago that we rented, purchased, whatever. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um I found that interesting. I found it helpful. But th this goes far beyond that.</p>
<p>Yeah. There are so many players uh individuals have been brought into this documentary and they almost speak as one man. They almost speak as one voice. It is just so much over and over. It is concerning when I hear and I didn&#x27;t hear this necessarily throughout &gt;&gt; when you hear &gt;&gt; multiple people saying the same thing over and over like the same phrases.</p>
<p>Yeah. the same phrases like they&#x27;ve been giving their marching orders and they&#x27;ve been giving their talking points. &gt;&gt; I I would not say that that this movie is that, but it is so many people giving so many accounts and confirming that yes, it&#x27;s real. Yes, it&#x27;s real. &gt;&gt; And uh if these kind of programs interest you, then go ahead and smash that like button, subscribe to our channel, help us build the big picture family.</p>
<p>One of the things I noticed that was unprecedented. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And is that there was equal number of Democrats and Republicans saying the same thing. Okay. And and in fact, um Luna was on there and one of the things that she said, she said, &quot;In my time in Congress, this is the only issue that I have ever seen ever brought before us where it is 100% by uh what it bipartisan &gt;&gt; where where there is no push back either side.</p>
<p>Everybody says the same thing. They want to see the truth.&quot; &gt;&gt; And of course, it had Harry Reid, the late Harry Reid was Yes. In fact, they even say in the movie that uh Alzando, is that Lou Alzando? &gt;&gt; Lou Alzando. &gt;&gt; He he says this, none of this would be possible without Harry Reed. &gt;&gt; He absolutely said that.</p>
<p>Um and I can remember when he was still alive, he you know him speaking, him trying to get into this and &gt;&gt; roadblocks one after another because &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s so guarded. &gt;&gt; It is so guarded. And you know, you said a moment ago, you know, okay, everybody&#x27;s saying the same thing. Um, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at all if one of these individuals in the documentary is a gatekeeper. &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, I&#x27;m not completely comfortable with Lou Alzando. And he is &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; He is prominent prominent throughout. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s like the narrator, but he probably speaks more than anybody.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not the narrator, but he&#x27;s the main face. &gt;&gt; He seems to be the main face. I tried to stay with the entire documentary from beginning to end. It was hard to commit that much time, you know, bumping up against Showtime coming right out of a major event today. Um, but yeah, I&#x27;m not completely convinced that he&#x27;s not a gatekeeper.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, we look, &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re going to break it down tonight. We&#x27;re going to show you the trailer in just a few minutes if you haven&#x27;t seen it. answer the question uh with Hannah Han Hanlure. Uh this is not an LA Marzuli film. LA is going to respond and react to the film.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is by uh let&#x27;s see about his name. Dan Farah. Dan Farah. &gt;&gt; Dan Farah &gt;&gt; and I don&#x27;t know any of his other work, but this is a Dan Farah &gt;&gt; production. And look it if if the disclo the disclosure is obviously beginning.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s beginning. We&#x27;ve been covering it here and we&#x27;ve said it&#x27;s And by the way, we also covered a show where several people said it&#x27;s actually going to kick in from Huntsville, Alabama. Oh, that was a great show. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so that&#x27;s so there&#x27;s some things that are coming.</p>
<p>This is the next phase. And by the way, when I was talking to Elliot on the phone, he&#x27;s going to break something tonight on our program uh regarding the rungs of disclosure in this film. So, you need to stay tuned for that. He&#x27;s going to come in somewhere around the top of the hour, uh maybe a little bit before 8:00, uh central time. But, we&#x27;re going to show you a few things and talk about it, break it down as we go forward.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, look at Der Lynn making a pro proclamation. &gt;&gt; What were we saying? Soon they are going to interview one of these &gt;&gt; inter what something something they&#x27;re gonna interview something uh but here here&#x27;s the thing if this disclosure is beginning I believe it is I believe you know obviously the disclosures agenda is not good so it&#x27;s like you know we&#x27;re not on here show making a show woohoo we&#x27;re excited the UFOs are coming no we know what the ultimate goal is going to be is going to be try to to bring them out as our creators to bring them out as our uh seed planters. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s what this agenda is really about. &gt;&gt; I mean, it&#x27;s ultimately about control or a big step towards control. I mean, come on, guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, &gt;&gt; seriously. &gt;&gt; So, so we see in here um Dana Eisenhower&#x27;s agreement with some ET to use some animals and some human unknown and what we did receive back. Uh we&#x27;ve heard that. We&#x27;ve heard that. And and look, he&#x27;s in the film.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a couple of uh black and white uh videos of him talking about trying to warn he called it the military complex, industrial complex, but others have said that that was the best that he was given permission to say, but it was beyond just the military. So, let&#x27;s watch this uh trailer. &gt;&gt; This is the trailer for the film The Age of Disclosure. &gt;&gt; The American people are ready to receive the truth. Humanity is not the only intelligence in the universe.</p>
<p>Humanity is not the only intelligent species. &gt;&gt; We are absolutely not alone. Non-human intelligence exists. &gt;&gt; UAPs are real. They&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re not human.</p>
<p>I spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA. &gt;&gt; I worked on highly classified UAP program. &gt;&gt; 28 years as an astrophysicist. I served as the fourth director of national intelligence, &gt;&gt; director of aviation security in the National Security Council. The one-star admiral after 32 years of service.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; People that come forward with this, I I feel like they&#x27;ve taken their their life in their own hands. &gt;&gt; I was recruited to a highly sensitive government program that investigated unidentified aerial phenomenon. For over 16 years, on behalf of the US government, I worked as a senior intelligence official on the unidentified aerial phenomenon topic. We learned that the US government was involved in a longunning secret war with other nations to collect and reverse engineer vehicles not made by humans. I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s rotating. There&#x27;s a whole fleet of them. &gt;&gt; The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. China has established its own version of a UAP task force. &gt;&gt; You think for a second that they wouldn&#x27;t consider using it to achieve their ends of domination? This is similar to the Manhattan project.</p>
<p>This is the atomic weapon on steroids. &gt;&gt; This is so secret very very few people in our entire government have been allowed access to it. &gt;&gt; Even presidents have been operating on a need to- know basis. But that begins to ramp out of control. It&#x27;s not acceptable to have secret parts of government that no one ever sees.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You better be careful about a government. &gt;&gt; So, just in that little bit of CL, we&#x27;re going to finish it, but you saw Republican, Republican, Democrat, Democrat, Republican, Democrat, man, woman. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; So, this is like a universal topic here. And that&#x27;s what makes me believe that this is probably not good for us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Man doesn&#x27;t trust his people cuz there&#x27;s no telling what they&#x27;ll pull on you. &gt;&gt; This is the biggest discovery in human history. You had information being locked away that could change the trajectory for species. &gt;&gt; It has so many beneficial impacts, including clean energy. &gt;&gt; We should have disclosure today.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We should have disclosure tomorrow. &gt;&gt; The time has come. &gt;&gt; Wow. I&#x27;ll tell you this, it&#x27;s a far cry from that nothing burger we got in uh the hearings or whatever that was four years ago. Coming up on four years ago or something like that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Um yeah. So uh I have a question. I wonder if uh the timing of this release, I mean, you know, here we are right at Thanksgiving coming up on these major holidays and uh people are going to be coming together &gt;&gt; and sitting around not at work with some free time on their hands. Maybe it&#x27;s an awesome time to just mle this over and talk about it with the family and throw something up on the social media platforms and so forth.</p>
<p>And um obviously I don&#x27;t know to what level but uh surely some uh news channels and you know will be picking it up and I don&#x27;t know. Um thanks Vic for that wonderful super chat. &gt;&gt; Thank you for that super chat Vic. &gt;&gt; But yeah so I have that question. Was this was this released right now &gt;&gt; for that reason? Was there another reason? I&#x27;m just &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s not forget that just a couple of days ago the Epstein file.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so of course this the release date for this has been set for a while, but can we put it past them releasing the Epstein files knowing this was going to come out on the same weekend that they voted to release the EP? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m always curious about I&#x27;m always curious about that. Aren&#x27;t you the timing of things and the placement of things? &gt;&gt; Well, one of the things Marco Rubio said in that trailer is he said presidents have been on a need to know basis. You know, we talked about that long time. &gt;&gt; Long time.</p>
<p>Well, the producer Dan Farah has come out this week and said the pre President Trump could reveal the existence of nonhuman intelligent life in the near future, says the documentary director. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I found that very interesting when he said that. &gt;&gt; The most significant presidential announcement in human history might just be around the corner. Dan Farah, the director behind the explosive documentary The Age of Disclosure, uh tells Entertainment Weekly that he believes the release of this film of his film could lead to the president of the United States publicly revealing the existence of non-human intelligent life. Quote, I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, &quot;We are not alone in the universe.&quot; It&#x27;s the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Through shocking testimony from 34 US government, military and intelligence community officials, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, current Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Christian Gibrand. The film explores what many in the interview subjects describe as quote an 80year global cover up of nonhuman intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer advanced technology of nonhuman origin. In the film interview s subjects including uh secretary of state Rubio also explained how senior politicians even the president might be kept from in the dark about such a momentous secret. &gt;&gt; Right. And I will say about Rubio I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of his.</p>
<p>I think I&#x27;m becoming a a a bigger fan currently like at this moment. I thought he did well. I thought he spoke well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in this documentary.</p>
<p>Um whether or not he was telling the absolute truth, no, I I don&#x27;t know. But um I liked his calm demeanor and you know, it just we need to realize this guy I don&#x27;t know what all he&#x27;s being privy to, but uh he&#x27;s probably had a lot laid at his feet and put on his plate. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; In these last months of his life. And many many people believe that he will probably run as the vice president to JD Vance.</p>
<p>Um &gt;&gt; maybe &gt;&gt; but think about Donald Trump. Okay, if Donald Trump is has said, &quot;Okay, either you or the next president is going to and tell the world &gt;&gt; that aliens exist.&quot; &gt;&gt; What do you think Donald Trump&#x27;s going to say? &gt;&gt; There ain&#x27;t no way in this world Donald Trump is going to say, &quot;I&#x27;ll leave it for the next guy.&quot; &gt;&gt; No way. There is no way. Listen to me, guys. &gt;&gt; This is perfect for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Our president. Are you kidding me? He probably would look, this is opportunity of a lifetime. &gt;&gt; As if I if I haven&#x27;t already sealed &gt;&gt; my legacy. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He&#x27;d be like, &quot;These aliens are huge.&quot; They&#x27;re huge. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And listen, we&#x27;ve said so so so many times on this program, his uncle, his uncle. His uncle &gt;&gt; John George Trump. Is that his name? &gt;&gt; Yeah, remind him.</p>
<p>Is it Fred? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No, it&#x27;s not Fred. &gt;&gt; He had access to some of Tesla&#x27;s &gt;&gt; most important Yes. &gt;&gt; papers, research. &gt;&gt; He took him out of his room when he died.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. And uh &gt;&gt; of natural causes. I&#x27;ve just always believed Donald Trump either heard of what his uncle saw or maybe he saw it firsthand. I just have to believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you would you would think you would think that he knows something.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And and but let&#x27;s go back to this real quick and then we&#x27;re going to show you another clip and uh we&#x27;re going to talk about this. And don&#x27;t forget if you&#x27;re coming in late, LA Marzulli, the man, the myth, the legend, the voice in this topic, wrote the book, The Rungs of Disclosure. Been on our show many times. I&#x27;ve been on his show. Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um won&#x27;t be long. We&#x27;ll be going out to California and uh we&#x27;ll be doing a show in person with him. &gt;&gt; Hope so. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s invited us out there. So, we&#x27;re excited about that.</p>
<p>But he&#x27;s going to be joining us at the top of the hour. It&#x27;s just right around 30 minutes from now. He&#x27;ll be calling in live on the air from California. He&#x27;s already been breaking this down. He has, you know, he&#x27;s analyzed it.</p>
<p>I mean, he&#x27;s broke it down. There&#x27;s nobody better. And he and he literally said, &quot;For the Big Picture family, I&#x27;ll do it. I&#x27;ll do whatever y&#x27;all need cuz I love the Big Picture family.&quot; &gt;&gt; He is. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s awesome.</p>
<p>Gosh, he&#x27;s all up in this. He went to um New Mexico. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t remember the person that escorted him out and they found what they say is part of this alien craft. &gt;&gt; Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They found these &gt;&gt; they found the metal &gt;&gt; these metals that really can&#x27;t be identified as being from here. &gt;&gt; So, um he&#x27;s been on the trail like he says on the trail, &gt;&gt; but he&#x27;s been on the trail of the UFO as well. Yes. &gt;&gt; For many years. So in this film, CIA, the DIA, Pentagon, astrophysicists, military insiders, they&#x27;re all here and they&#x27;re all, as you said earlier, saying the same thing.</p>
<p>The government is openly acknowledging &gt;&gt; repeatedly. They&#x27;re not saying there might be. I mean, on this documentary, they&#x27;re saying these are people that have lifelong career people are saying there are nonhuman intelligence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And let&#x27;s be clear, I don&#x27;t I think you said this earlier.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about politicians. We&#x27;re talking about uh physicists. We&#x27;re talking about people &gt;&gt; generals. &gt;&gt; Generals. People from, you know, different um backgrounds.</p>
<p>Some of them kind of younger. You&#x27;ve got David Gush going to make an appearance. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve got some middle-aged people. You&#x27;ve got How put off uh Put Off, however you pronounce his name. He&#x27;s got to be in his 80s.</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, what is what is the is there a Victor Davis or the guy &gt;&gt; the other guy that&#x27;s always talking to him? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The main guy. &gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t remember sources. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s the one that said he said he he openly says in this program, he goes, &quot;When I begin to see these things, he&#x27;s the one that says he&#x27;s seen alien beings, not just Christ, but actual alien beings.&quot; That&#x27;s what he says, whatever they are. And he said, &quot;So when I begin to push Congress and push these intelligence people to to let&#x27;s discuss this, they said they said they pushed him back and said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t want to mess with this because these are demons.&quot; And he says it in a in a negative way, like making fun of people that believe in demons. He goes, &quot;You want to tell me that we can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t investigate this because they&#x27;re demons?&quot; So what I&#x27;m trying to tell you is there are at the very least high ranking intelligence and military officials who are openly saying we need to leave this alone because these are not aliens. These are these are demonic forces. He says it in the film.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He did say that. I&#x27;m trying to give full attention to this but I can&#x27;t at that moment when that was being said. Do you think that was a disclosure or a tactic to try to persuade him? You know, look, &gt;&gt; well, I mean, whoever it was and whatever he was doing, he told the truth because they are demonic. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know what I&#x27;m saying? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s really crazy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t want to hurt anybody&#x27;s feelings, but if you watching this program and look, we got people that watch the big picture from all different genres and all different parts of this line here of belief system and aliens. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, but if you believe that the aliens that are out there, whatever you call them, &gt;&gt; are wanting to come and help us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I hate to break it to you, man. You have drank the Kool-Aid. &gt;&gt; Sure. Because I&#x27;m telling you, they are not our friends. They are not th this disclosure that&#x27;s coming out is not so that we can feel all warm and f fuzzy about the future, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re going to promote energy.</p>
<p>You heard them say it in the trailer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Blue energy just like the show V. &gt;&gt; And it seems like it&#x27;s going to be right on Q as we need so much more energy &gt;&gt; for AI. What is the one thing? What do we say all the time? The one thing that all these AI people say that we got to have if we&#x27;re going to grow AI energy and and so so lo and behold, there&#x27;s going to be low cost or no no cost energy.</p>
<p>And then there&#x27;s going to be the cures to cancer and then there&#x27;s going to be uh by the way we can you know it says it says it in the in this movie Age of Disclosure that man the one part that was wild I was in here working. I was listening to it and I got I can&#x27;t wait to go back and actually break it down and watch it. But they were talking about how in a certain amount of time, multiple occasions, they lost control completely of their nuclear weapons. And that there was one point, did they not say that we lost control of the defense of North America or something to that extent? &gt;&gt; Is that the Malstrom event? Am I &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t remember what it was, but they were talking about that these aliens or these crafts came in and took over all of the controls of nuclear weapons. and they they couldn&#x27;t get it back until they just left and then all of a sudden everything come back on.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if all this is true or not but these are very powerful people saying this. &gt;&gt; Yes. I mean there are those claims. &gt;&gt; There are also the description of how these crafts travel. What do they call it? The in the time space bubble or something like that.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re like, um, when you are in the time space bubble, speaking of the UFO or the craft, um, you&#x27;re not affected &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; by the outside. And he even goes as far as to say whether in space, whether in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, or whether under the water. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; Either of these mediums does not affect how you move, how you travel.</p>
<p>So, so I don&#x27;t remember the the numbers, but they were talking about the fastest craft that we have in the world. How fast it could go. And this these crafts that they have clocked have been going like 10,000 to 20,000 miles per hour, &gt;&gt; even higher. Well, even higher. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was like it would rip any bodies apart. And they said even if it was a drone at that speed, the drone would come apart and it couldn&#x27;t handle it. So, it&#x27;s like, you know, we&#x27;ve seen these things and we&#x27;ve they said they&#x27;ve clocked underwater craft going five and 600 miles an hour underwater. &gt;&gt; And here here &gt;&gt; with no with no wake. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s another interesting point.</p>
<p>And he wasn&#x27;t talking about going at this very top speed, although you might be able to do that. That the beings, if there were beings in this craft, it would be like they were sitting there, you know? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Not even being affected. &gt;&gt; Not even being affected. So, it&#x27;s just um that whole spaceime continuum thing.</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#x27;s real. &gt;&gt; Well, according to them. &gt;&gt; According to &gt;&gt; But hey, one of the things I talk about in the book is, you know, breaking down the technology that came from the fallen angels and from other dimensions. So, look, we&#x27;re we&#x27;re going to say that there&#x27;s possible that that kind of technology exists, but that&#x27;s technology that exists outside of our dimension. And the thing that made it illegal in the spirit realm was that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to come to us, &gt;&gt; but somehow it came to us.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; let&#x27;s go over here and let&#x27;s watch a little bit of this &gt;&gt; interview where the producer came on the a uh talk about the age of disclosure on Fox News with Brett Bearer. This is a very interesting interview. Tonight, we get a first look at a new documentary on UAPs and what government officials may know about top secret programs on the subject. It features testimony from 34 high-ranking government officials. My colleague Brett Bearer speaks with the director and producer of the age of disclosure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s not ours. They have both deactivated and activated nuclear weapons with both the United States and Russia. &gt;&gt; These are other worldly things that are performing maneuvers that have haven&#x27;t been seen. &gt;&gt; The UAP activity surrounding nuclear weapons is not a historic issue. It&#x27;s an ongoing issue.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, joining us now to talk about his new film, The Age of Disclosure, is director and producer Dan Farah. He says the documentary reveals an 80year cover up of nonhuman intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer advanced technology of nonhuman origin. The film will be released in select theaters in New York, Washington, and Los Angeles on November 21st. Also available worldwide to purchase and rent on Prime Video. Dan, thanks for being here.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve been working on this for more than 3 years and you say this is going to be a groundbreaking documentary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um I interviewed 34 extremely high level military government intelligence officials who all have direct knowledge of this issue. Um much of what they know is classified but in this film they break their silence on what they can lawfully disclose.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean there&#x27;s a lot of skepticism as you know there&#x27;s a lot of stigmatism about this issue. Um, but as you&#x27;re talking to all of these people and you&#x27;re building these blocks for this movie, you get to the point where it&#x27;s not a matter of if it&#x27;s happening or if it&#x27;s real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; okay, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s stop that and we go right back to it. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But he makes it very clear. It&#x27;s no longer &gt;&gt; a matter of if. You make it clear that it&#x27;s real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And um I believe LA in a video from maybe two days ago poses the question or the point here we have the most conservative part of Fox News.</p>
<p>Brett Bear, he calls him the most conservative, interviewing this this man Dan Farah, the producer, the creator of Age of Disclosure about all of these things. And let&#x27;s go all the way back to And I was there. I was there in December 2017, that first airing of Tucker Carlson. Yeah. With the Tic Tac.</p>
<p>I &gt;&gt; It was the end of the year. I could not believe &gt;&gt; what I was seeing and hearing. And we go from there to coming through all of these hearings and all of these news pieces and all the things of debunking and people embracing this and to this point where we are right now. Look how far this has come. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah. We&#x27;re talking about at least 2017 to now. That&#x27;s eight years. What is eight years? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s nothing &gt;&gt; amongst Eight decades. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Look, they are &gt;&gt; they&#x27;re no longer slow walking us to the conclusion. All right. Am I saying it right? Saying it right. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not slow walking us anymore because guess what? &gt;&gt; I believe if they wanted to stop or put a kink in the release of this documentary, they could do it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And if you watch the documentary, you&#x27;ll probably hear more than one person say fearful for their life. Um, you will hear the interviewer say, &quot;I had people that wouldn&#x27;t come forth because they were too afraid. They were afraid for their lives, their famil family&#x27;s lives.&quot; But still, look where we are. There&#x27;s enough people who are willing to take that risk to bring us to this point. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>Well said. Well said. Let&#x27;s continue. Every single person I interviewed made it very clear that it was no longer a question of whether this was a real situation. It&#x27;s a very real situation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Humanity is not the only intelligence in the universe. &gt;&gt; Humanity is not the only intelligent species. We are absolutely not alone. Non-human intelligence exists. UAPs are real.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re not human. &gt;&gt; The questions now are who&#x27;s controlling the UAP? Where do they come from? And what is their intention? This sounds I mean it&#x27;s hard for everybody to digest. Uh and an 80year cover up with a country that keeps it deep and dark and it hasn&#x27;t gotten out. That&#x27;s the tough part for people to buy into. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, a number of the officials in my film make it clear that a long time ago, this topic was moved away from congressional oversight and even away from the oversight of the president of the United States. And there are certain elements within our government and within defense contractors that have really been gatekeeping the knowledge about this topic. And there are people in this film who are respected in their fields who say they have seen these craft and have seen the recovered nonhuman bodies. &gt;&gt; I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings. &gt;&gt; They go on the record about the fact that there have been crashed craft that have been recovered.</p>
<p>In some cases, there&#x27;s been non-human bodies in these craft. They they claim these are people who are putting their reputation and their names on the line. You know, often you hear people say, &quot;Show me the evidence.&quot; In my opinion, 34 extremely credible people putting their name and reputation on the line is the best evidence because we live in a time where you could put a video or a photo out and everyone will half the people out there will say it&#x27;s fake or &gt;&gt; AI and everything else. &gt;&gt; The title is age of disclosure and do you think that this is going to start something bigger? The premise of this is that there is a race to reverse engineer what has been recovered by different countries essentially competing against one another. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, one of the big reveals in the film that a number of the interview subjects share is that elements of the US government are in a highstakes secret cold war race with adversarial nations like China and Russia to reverse engineer technology of non-human origin. &gt;&gt; Yep. And you&#x27;ll hear them talk about um &gt;&gt; this race they&#x27;re talking about. We cannot allow another country to get out ahead of us. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We can&#x27;t be in the position of having to play catchup. Even though quite frankly, I feel like we probably are in um not the space race necessarily, maybe in some of our war efforts. Maybe Russia really does maybe Russia is really putting us to shame with their latest submarine. Maybe China is putting us to shame with maybe just the mere number of new craft of new pieces of equipment. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But I think we&#x27;ve gotten we we got a little lazy in our country and we forgot how very important the race was. &gt;&gt; Uh again, not the space race, just the military race. But then there&#x27;s this whole other thing, this whole other level. You got to take it up another notch. &gt;&gt; And and then and then you know, you remember what Jesus said.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;See that you&#x27;ve been not deceived as in the days of Noah.&quot; So there there is a there is a nation race, but then there&#x27;s also a spiritual race. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I mean, the enemy knows the signs of the times better than most church people. &gt;&gt; So he realizes, okay, if I&#x27;m going to do anything, I got to this race has got to start running. Think about Paul.</p>
<p>Paul talked about I&#x27;m running the race. It&#x27;s a race. It&#x27;s a race. It&#x27;s just always been a spiritual race. And when you become the final generation, you&#x27;re going to see things rapid fire.</p>
<p>I mean, think about how quick things come on the news and we&#x27;re like, &quot;What in the world?&quot; And two days later, we forgot about it. And it&#x27;s like, so, so here&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at. You know, by the way, nobody&#x27;s talking about Epstein tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. &gt;&gt; You know, nobody.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s like they they&#x27;ve mastered the ability to squirrel. But this is a big squirrel. This is the big squirrel this is. And like I said, LA Marzuli is going to join us in about 15 minutes. So don&#x27;t go anywhere.</p>
<p>And when he comes in, he&#x27;s going to break something about the rungs of disclosure of where this goes in that and what it&#x27;s going to mean. &gt;&gt; But let&#x27;s talk about where this thing moved from. You know, all our life we heard it called UFOs. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; It was very strange that they changed it to UAP.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And and it&#x27;s like to this day, I&#x27;ll be honest with you, I don&#x27;t even really know why that was necessary. Do you? Why? Why Why do they even say that&#x27;s necessary? &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; why can&#x27;t we just call them UFOs? &gt;&gt; Well, obviously I believe that was a tactic to confuse people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, okay, &gt;&gt; confuse me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve called it UFOs for decades and decades. And now you want to put this UAP. Well, &gt;&gt; you put that in an article, someone is reading, looking through news articles, they might gloss right over that &gt;&gt; UAP. I don&#x27;t know what that is. &gt;&gt; They don&#x27;t even know what that is.</p>
<p>Just keep going. But uh I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other reasons for it as well. &gt;&gt; And then look, let&#x27;s think about this is all strategic is so they go from UFO to UAP. &gt;&gt; Then think about this. They go from ET extraterrestrial to now nonhuman intelligence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Why was that necessary? Why &gt;&gt; what is it? What did it do for you? I mean, you were just coming into this scene when these things are beginning to happen. Yeah. UAP and all of this. What did it do for you as a person that hadn&#x27;t never delved into this? &gt;&gt; Well, it made me really want to delve into it more because it it was like, okay, some kind of agenda is going on because what would it hurt if even if your your purpose and your your agenda was to start rolling this out? Why did you have to get away from extraterrestrial? Part of my theory is is that they knew that that had become such a part of Hollywood ET and all that and they they needed something that sounded a little more scientific that wasn&#x27;t so much sci-fi.</p>
<p>So you got UAP. What is that? Um how what is the UAP? I can anomalous um &gt;&gt; um unidentified anomalous anomalous phenomena. Phenomena. Phenomena. &gt;&gt; Phenomena.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You phenomena. &gt;&gt; You can find a reason to sing and dance. You almost just amazing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Come on.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s stuck in y&#x27;all&#x27;s head cuz y&#x27;all going, &quot;Okay, &gt;&gt; but then they went from extraterrestrial to nonhuman intelligence.&quot; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why? Why couldn&#x27;t you have just left it at extraterrestrial? Why? because I think they&#x27;re sort of trying to project and it&#x27;s almost like what you always talk about the predictor program they got to tell you certain things before they do it and and so extraterrestrial means from another planet nonhuman intelligence could be and this is one of the things they say in the movie maybe this is a offshoot of humanity that evolved billions of years ago into a different direction and they went under the water and they&#x27;ve been living down there. They literally say this in there that they&#x27;ve been living underwater and they&#x27;ve been managing all of us little minions that hadn&#x27;t evolved and they that&#x27;s why they call it non-human intelligence. And another thing they said about the ocean, they said, &quot;Look, &gt;&gt; we have HD pictures of the moon and of Mars, but we don&#x27;t even have pictures of 80% of the bottom of the oceans of the world that we haven&#x27;t even we haven&#x27;t explored.&quot; 80% &gt;&gt; 75% of this planet is covered by ocean &gt;&gt; and 80% of that we&#x27;ve never investigated. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a lot of ground, not ground underwater to to cover.</p>
<p>Well, that one one of the guys says, &quot;If I&#x27;m an alien from another country, from another planet, and I want to hide &gt;&gt; here, I go in the water.&quot; &gt;&gt; So, is that why more and more people are talking about the water now and not space? &gt;&gt; We we&#x27;ve been hearing, I would say, for myself probably six, seven years underwater bases. The USO, the unidentified submersible objects. Why aren&#x27;t they called phenomena? &gt;&gt; Phenomena. &gt;&gt; They may be. &gt;&gt; Why? I can&#x27;t say the word phenomena without singing it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Singing. Oh wow. Okay. &gt;&gt; But but seriously, UFO, but now you&#x27;re going to call it a USO. Why is it not a phenomena? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And why did they change the purview of all of I want to say the management I guess at least the research of of all of this. Did it not come out from under the purview of the Air Force and now it&#x27;s under the purview of the Navy? &gt;&gt; Go figure that. &gt;&gt; How convenient when &gt;&gt; we used to look up in the sky &gt;&gt; when there&#x27;s so much talk now about, &gt;&gt; you know, underwater bases. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, you just said they&#x27;re controlling us up here from under the water.</p>
<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying I believe that. Okay. Exactly. I&#x27;m just saying, you know, what a turn of hand here. &gt;&gt; So, in in the film, um, you know, experts start talking about spiritual things.</p>
<p>Remember when they had the the quote unquote hearings and they went in the skiff and they came back out of the skiff, several of the senators and representatives said, &quot;What did they tell you?&quot; Well, the reporter said, &quot;What did they tell you?&quot; Well, they told us that they were interdimensional beings. &gt;&gt; They literally said that. Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; Interdimensional beings, not interplanetary, interdimensional. &gt;&gt; So, how long ago the uh event you&#x27;re talking about? How long ago has that been? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s been about three years ago.</p>
<p>Two two and a half years ago. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m thinking two maybe three years ago. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, we&#x27;ve got some people that have really come &gt;&gt; um to the front of the line in this, you know, &gt;&gt; even women, you know, Anapina Luna. Is it Nancy Mazize? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this this documentary &gt;&gt; Jill Gillibrand, she was on the documentary. &gt;&gt; Um, she&#x27;s from New York. &gt;&gt; Christine Gillbrand.</p>
<p>Yeah. This documentary was the first time I now I probably missed a lot, but it&#x27;s the first time I can remember her uh speaking or that I should say I&#x27;ve seen her speaking. But like I said, you&#x27;ve got younger people, middle-aged people, older people, all giving their perspective because you&#x27;ve got military, you&#x27;ve got politicians, you&#x27;ve got people from scientific backgrounds, and they&#x27;re all pretty much in agreement, right? Oh yeah. It&#x27;s the most bipartisan thing we&#x27;ve ever seen. &gt;&gt; Locks down, &gt;&gt; which should scare us to death.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t get along on anything, but they all getting along on &gt;&gt; this. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Is that not Well, I say scare to death, but we ain&#x27;t got no spirit of fear. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But but the some of the things that they are admitting in this in this in this documentary, and by the way, we encourage you to go watch it.</p>
<p>It don&#x27;t have any cursing. It&#x27;s not I mean, it&#x27;s just you got to be prepared to hear theories that might not line up with your spiritually speaking because there&#x27;s all kinds of things. But they&#x27;re talking about entities that shut down nuclear missiles at will. They have technology be against beyond anything on Earth. They&#x27;ve interacted.</p>
<p>This is what they say openly. They have been they have been interacting with our military on all levels in all branches for decades. &gt;&gt; They have programs that exist outside of congressional oversight and information has been tightly controlled. 80-year cover up. And of course, they say in this documentary that the timing right now is very intentional and that the roll out has begun.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the part that gets my attention because we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve been getting drip drip drip, but it&#x27;s like it is speeding up. And I&#x27;m coming from the perspective and the aspect that probably things like this don&#x27;t get to happen unless somebody way up the chain wills it to be so. And I can&#x27;t remember was there a lot of talk or any talk about the amount of money that has been spent for the cover up &gt;&gt; quite frankly &gt;&gt; trillions. How long is the body count? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; because you know there have been multiple multiple people taken out &gt;&gt; for the sake of keeping this quiet. &gt;&gt; No doubt.</p>
<p>No doubt. I &gt;&gt; I believe we have given other countries, other nations money under the opaces of some kind of help &gt;&gt; like we&#x27;re helping them, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; What if it was hush money? Look, look, we know you have down craft.</p>
<p>We know you have things. We know you want to come out and say things to the world, but here, take this money. Take this aid. We&#x27;ll call it aid and be quiet &gt;&gt; because we we Yeah, &gt;&gt; the United States of America, &gt;&gt; say it. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not ready.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the way I feel about it. &gt;&gt; I think you&#x27;re spot on. I think I think you&#x27;re absolutely spot on. I think that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at. &gt;&gt; Do you remember Do you remember talk about payoffs? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; In this documentary? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>There was there&#x27;s payoffs. And there and there is discussion of the lives that you&#x27;re speaking of. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; That that they they open this. Uh oh.</p>
<p>Uh oh. &gt;&gt; Is he here? &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s calling in. We bring him in in just a moment. &gt;&gt; All right, guys. &gt;&gt; Let me make sure that we got him in.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I see him. I see him. I see him. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s in the green room waiting. We&#x27;re about to bring in none other than the man I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
<p>Some people I I say this a lot, the man, the myth, the legend. But y&#x27;all, this is the man, the myth, the legend. &gt;&gt; He is the original. &gt;&gt; He is the original, y&#x27;all. He is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We got the OG in the house. &gt;&gt; We got the OG in the house. Now &gt;&gt; OG. &gt;&gt; Now, I had to set up these scenes to to right before the show, so I hope they work. But ladies and gentlemen, the crowd goes wild.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s welcome in none other than LA. Oh my god. &gt;&gt; You guys are You guys are totally unbelievable. &gt;&gt; No, sir. This is your moment.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is your You&#x27;re the OG. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Hey, you were born for this, man. This This is your This is your lane right here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, LA, how are you doing, first of all. &gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m doing good. Thanks for having me on. Great to see you both. I was just telling Peggy about &gt;&gt; about you and the two of you need to get together.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; We are the alternate Thelma and Louise. So, y&#x27;all just need to know. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Well, well, I said earlier in the show that we&#x27;re looking forward to going out west and hanging out and meeting you guys and and just uh y&#x27;all, I&#x27;m going just tell you something.</p>
<p>LA is he&#x27;s he&#x27;s known all around the world for for this genre, but we we really mean this. LA, you&#x27;re the real deal. You&#x27;re a man of God, and he&#x27;s humble. He&#x27;s He loves God with all his heart and he is being used by God in this moment. So, LA, thank you for coming on on short notice.</p>
<p>Uh you&#x27;re live in the studio with us tonight. You have already uh put out a video that I&#x27;m encouraging everyone to go to his uh YouTube channel and watch it. His reaction to the age of disclosure. Uh but I just want to get your your first initial thoughts when you sat down to watch it knowing that you&#x27;ve wrote your book, The Rungs of Disclosure. you knew this was coming and you sit there&#x27;s his book right there.</p>
<p>There it is right there. There it is. Look at look at there. That&#x27;s amazing. So, as you&#x27;re you&#x27;ve wrote the book, The Runs Disclosure.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve talked about it on our show and uh you&#x27;re sitting there and watching this. What&#x27;s the first thing that&#x27;s going through your mind? &gt;&gt; Um it&#x27;s a managed agenda. &gt;&gt; This is this is so deliberate. Why now? And and how does Don Farah get access to all of these people? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; How how does that happen? You know, Marco Rubio sits down with this guy.</p>
<p>I tried to get Lou Lou Alzando on my show for the last year. I read his book. I I have emails back and forth. I can&#x27;t get him on the show. And you know, and I get that I I come from a biblical prophetic perspective, worldview, which is a complete turnoff to a lot of these guys.</p>
<p>But, you know, the the opening statement, they&#x27;ve got a group of people of whistleblowers, of congressmen, um, exgovernment officials, whatever, and they&#x27;re all saying, &quot;We are not alone in the universe. &gt;&gt; What What does the church do with this? I&#x27;ve been banging this drum, guys, for 30 years, and even now it falls on deaf ears. My My phone&#x27;s not ringing off the hook. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m getting emails, but nothing, you know, nobody&#x27;s going, &quot;Oh my, you know, you guys are some of the first people that have contacted me to come on and talk about this.&quot; This is the 25th rung on a letter of disclosure. The book only has 17.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; It was focused a little over a year ago. Yeah. So, we&#x27;re rung number 25. And what what the the show, Age of Disclosure, is rung number 25.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I thought I thought that&#x27;s I thought that&#x27;s what you said. I wanted to be very clear uh here on the big picture. You are saying I mean how many did you say that we&#x27;re at right now? This is 25. &gt;&gt; This is number 25.</p>
<p>Correct. &gt;&gt; 25. So how many more do you think we have before we get to actual &gt;&gt; this is disclosure without the president without President Trump coming up to the microphone and go going okay we&#x27;ve known about and that&#x27;s I think that&#x27;s next. I really do because there&#x27;s really only one place to go and that is Donald Trump, President Trump stepped up to the microphone and states on the record, okay, you know, we&#x27;re not alone in the universe. &gt;&gt; Well, well, LA, we we were talking about earlier about Trump.</p>
<p>Come on. Donald Trump has given the opportunity to announce that aliens are real. And does anybody believe Donald Trump&#x27;s going to leave that for the next guy and that&#x27;s not going to be a part of his destiny and his legacy? No way. No, I agree. I totally agree.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; you know, there&#x27;s a saying I came up with a couple years ago that we go up in the rapture and they come down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I could be wrong on this and I need I&#x27;ve been saying this recently. It could be exactly the opposite. They come down &gt;&gt; and then we go up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And if that if that happens first, there&#x27;s your second Thessalonians deal, the great falling away, the apostasia. And I know that people have a lot of different interpretations about this. I totally get it and I have no idea whether I&#x27;m right or not. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see what unfolds.</p>
<p>But, you know, why would be, you know, why why is that even there? Um, some people think it deals just with Israel and Israel alone. And it may be, you know, but do not be troubled in minor spirit that the day of the Lord has come. Well, that&#x27;s the wrath of God and our gathering to him. Well, that&#x27;s the rapture. So, there&#x27;s two events.</p>
<p>that day, what day will come? &gt;&gt; You know, that day will not come until the apostasia, the falling away happens and then the man of sin is revealed. So, I mean, to me, you know, and I get it. I&#x27; I&#x27;ve sat down with theologians who are a lot smarter than I am. I&#x27;m just not convinced. I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re looking at.</p>
<p>So, if they do come down, you know, if if the UFO disclosure happens first, if if they come down, &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know that&#x27;s the game changer and you will see a mass exodus from the Christian church as we know it a mass is this the great falling away I don&#x27;t know &gt;&gt; right I it could be I mean it certainly and what bothers me is is the church is still completely asleep to this they don&#x27;t get it &gt;&gt; absolutely &gt;&gt; my phone is not ringing you guys are calling me John Matarazzo Charisma News you know Charisma media I mean I I did my show I&#x27;m faithful to the calling that God&#x27;s given me. &gt;&gt; But all glory to him. I mean, it&#x27;s he he&#x27;s the one that sets our feet my feet on pass. I mean, I I didn&#x27;t sign up for this.</p>
<p>And I I just pray to God I&#x27;m I&#x27;m faithful in this hour because this could be it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; This is this is uncharted waters, guys.</p>
<p>You really &gt;&gt; Well, it it blows my mind what you&#x27;re saying is that your phone should be blowing up. Yes. I mean it the first thought that comes to any any m any pastor that is really trying to equip their congregation for the final deception, &gt;&gt; the first name that should come to their mind is La Marzulli because you&#x27;re not some uh some um professor at Harvard that&#x27;s that&#x27;s trying to propagate an agenda. Say no names, but uh but you&#x27;re a man of God that&#x27;s going to approach everything from scripture. And that&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ll say about our church.</p>
<p>You know, we la we preach on this stuff on Sunday morning. I preach on aliens and and interdimensional beings on Sunday morning in our church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. So, it&#x27;s like that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re sort of like the freaks.</p>
<p>But &gt;&gt; yeah, that&#x27;s right. Well, well, you know, so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s let&#x27;s take a dive there. So, you have said repeatedly in all your books that you&#x27;ve wrote that these beings you believe that these beings are not interplanetary. You believe they&#x27;re interdimensional and you believe they&#x27;re fallen angel technology or something like that. Was there anything in this documentary that swayed you either way or did you get further confirmation? &gt;&gt; No, I mean look the people that are in this show with all due respect they have a world view.</p>
<p>They are promulgating a a paradigm and and that is that we are not alone in the universe. That&#x27;s what they all they&#x27;re all stating that and they&#x27;re right from their perspective. But they&#x27;re not looking at the idea that these could be interdimensional entities, fallen angels that are not from Zeticuli or Epsilon or Rodani or some other far away star system. They are interdimensional beings. They are fallen angels.</p>
<p>What I also found interesting is they didn&#x27;t really discuss the the deception. They didn&#x27;t talk about this cat-and- mouse game. They didn&#x27;t talk about the abduction phenomena. They didn&#x27;t mutilation phenomena. never never went there.</p>
<p>You know, they talked one guy, one gentleman is on the record stating, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the craft and I&#x27;ve seen, you know, I&#x27;ve seen aliens. I&#x27;ve seen them.&quot; Um, and two or three people, Mr. Pudof, Dr. Pudof was there also talking about the fact that there were four bodies recovered from Roswell. You know, our film on Roswell, we have two films, you know, I mean, there you go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, in the debris field and exoneration. Yeah. There were bodies recovered from from Roswell. You know, those of us um in eupfology as a Christian eupfologist, whatever. Um this is this is old news to me.</p>
<p>We broke the story with Robert Salis. Robert Salis was the base commander of the Malstrom uh inter intercontinental ballistic missile group where a UFO hovered over the gate and you know it turned off switched off 10 ICBMs. I mean how is that even possible? We broke the story in our watchers series. We were the first first production company ever to interview Robert Salace. So, you know, some of this is really old news.</p>
<p>It just confirms what those of us who have been, you know, doing the research and talking about this for decades literally. Um I mean it&#x27;s just nothing caught me by surprise except for the fact that they are they have one paradigm and that&#x27;s we are looking at extraterrestrials. We are not alone in the universe. That&#x27;s it. That is the paradigm that they were espousing in in that uh you know hour and 15 minutes whatever it was.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But you are spot on. Of course, they&#x27;re not going to say anything about this hybrid program and taking I mean that&#x27;s not the goal and they they can&#x27;t get off message and quite frankly it would completely freak people out if we talked about this across the board. But here&#x27;s my question to you. &gt;&gt; What do you think about Avi? What do you think about Lou Alzando? Are they gatekeepers? Are they really how they present themselves to us? What are they? &gt;&gt; Great question. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you something.</p>
<p>How does Avi Loe all of a sudden appear on all forms of media? How does that happen? Who calls up the producers and goes, &quot;Hey, you want this guy on?&quot; It&#x27;s just like Tucker Carlson in 2017. &gt;&gt; You know, Tucker is interviewing, which is the first rung on a ladder of disclosure, by the way. &gt;&gt; Tucker was interviewing Commander David Fraver, former F-16, F-18 pilot. And you know, Fraver says to Tucker on the show that whatever this was was not from this Earth. So, how does how does Commander David Fraver, which is essentially a nobody, what I mean by that is he&#x27;s not a media guy.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t have books or DVDs or anything. He&#x27;s just, you know, he&#x27;s an F-18 pilot. How does he wind up on Tucker? How does Avi Loe, brilliant man, Harvard professor, I&#x27;d love to get him on my show. How does Avi Lobe all of a sudden wind up on all forms of media? &gt;&gt; You know, everywhere. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s absolutely everywhere. How does that work? &gt;&gt; What you&#x27;re essentially saying is or posing this question. Were these individuals chosen for this moment? Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is a managed agenda in my opinion.</p>
<p>And that leads us down a very interesting rabbit hole. It really does. Who&#x27;s pulling the strings? &gt;&gt; Why now? &gt;&gt; Why is it that the Vatican a couple of weeks ago reiterated a statement if there&#x27;s life on other planets will baptize an alien? Why are they saying that? &gt;&gt; I mean, why why is it even there? &gt;&gt; And so, you know, you&#x27;ve got Avi Lobe talking about, you know, third eye atlas. Three eye atlas. Third third eye atlas.</p>
<p>And let me just walk you through that. Atlas is a Nephilim. &gt;&gt; You are. Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Atlas is a Nephilim. He&#x27;s a Greek god. He&#x27;s a progeny of fallen angels, the women of Earth.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s our wheelhouse. That&#x27;s my wheelhouse. So Atlas, so they&#x27;re saying he&#x27;s got the globe. He&#x27;s got the world on his shoulders. &gt;&gt; Are they signaling that this is a global event? &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m just saying this is conjecture. Third eye, right? Three eye. Third eye. &gt;&gt; Yes. enlightenment.</p>
<p>The third eye is open. It&#x27;s a global enlightenment that we are not alone. And I just watched a thing from the um some some YouTube video. My my friend Sonda sent it to me. And um the angry astronaut, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called.</p>
<p>And he was looking at three Atlas saying, &quot;Wait a minute. You know, this thing&#x27;s got way too many anomalies. This is weird.&quot; So you get one one side&#x27;s going, &quot;Oh, this is just a comet.&quot; You got the other side going down so fast we don&#x27;t know what it is. What are we looking at? I got to tell you something. &gt;&gt; If this is what I lobe is postulating, at least saying, well, it could be.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not saying it is, but he is saying, well, it might be not so fast and we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re looking at. If if this thing stops or does a direct maneuver, then you know, we&#x27;re off to the races here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And and wouldn&#x27;t it just be just just like this for that to happen? It&#x27;s like I mean everything is strategically planned out and everything is usually &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I think projected to be a distraction from something else that&#x27;s actually happening so that you know a little bit of the story but not all of the story. Yes. I think I think we&#x27;re just getting a drip of things of ThreeI Atlas, a drip of the disclosure when there&#x27;s really major movement on disclosure happening, but they don&#x27;t want to let that out yet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, but but there this is the deal, Congress. And this is what people don&#x27;t get, you know, folks, you need to um you need to get get the book and throw it to your pastor. More than likely, he won&#x27;t read it. And and I understand that. I really do.</p>
<p>I totally get it. But he needs to. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because if if they show up &gt;&gt; before the rapture of a church, &gt;&gt; wow, &gt;&gt; that changes everything. You will watch a mass exodus from Christianity.</p>
<p>You will watch it. You will watch the great falling away. You will watch the apostasia, the the apocris. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll see. You&#x27;ll see it in real time.</p>
<p>I hope I&#x27;m wrong, but the way things are coming down, I hold on to things very loosely. And this is we are in unprecedented times. And you got to tell your pastor, Congress is talking about this, pastor. Congress, we have too many whistleblowers. There were 34 people in this film, Age of Disclosure.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve seen the bodies. They&#x27;ve seen the wreckage. You know, you need to address this. And if you don&#x27;t, you have to ask yourself why. And if they say, &quot;Well, this has nothing to do with the Bible.&quot; Think again.</p>
<p>Why would Jesus warn us that even the elect would be deceived &gt;&gt; from what is coming upon the earth? Why would Jesus say that something is coming upon the earth? It&#x27;s not coming from the earth. It&#x27;s coming down. It&#x27;s coming upon the earth. Men faithful and fearful is coming upon the earth. Even the elect would be deceived or possible.</p>
<p>Unless those days were shortened, no flesh would survive. And then Paul adds to it. Satan comes with all signs and lying wonders. Do we really think that this is some sort of a warm fuzzy, you know, statement by Jesus and Paul? We are seeing the coming great deception and it&#x27;s in our lifetime. And with AI, you know, which is just at the point where we now know longer what&#x27;s real.</p>
<p>We we no longer know what&#x27;s real or what&#x27;s fabricated. I mean, &gt;&gt; we are, you know, folks, you got to wake up here. You got to wake up. This is it. It&#x27;s coming down.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You You have to get rungs of disclosure. This is, you know, LA&#x27;s a man of God. He would tell you, get the Bible first, but then you got other books that can help you understand things in the Bible. Yep. &gt;&gt; And and you know, Jesus, man, in all the things and all the people that he could have told his disciples, go back and study this guy and it&#x27;ll be the conditions of when I come back.</p>
<p>He chooses the days of Noah. He chooses the Nephilim. I mean, come on. that he&#x27;s so intentional with everything he says. He was trying to tell us LA, am I not speaking truth here of trying to prepare that final generation for exactly what we&#x27;re talking about and and we&#x27;re here and it&#x27;s happening right now.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s not 10 years from now. It&#x27;s not speculation. &gt;&gt; So age of disclosure, 34 people, whistleblowers, government officials, congressmen, I mean all sorts of people are there, right? And you know, they were talking about the Stevensville Stevensville lights. I I covered that story. It&#x27;s in our book.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in my book, Further Evidence. I sat down with Ricky Sorl. I mean, he was the guy that that he&#x27;s out hunting on New Year&#x27;s Day and he&#x27;s gets caught up in a bunch of brambles. He&#x27;s out deer hunting, right? And he looks up, there&#x27;s a mile wide craft over him. There&#x27;s a mile wide UFO.</p>
<p>He could not see the edges of the craft. That&#x27;s how big this thing was. And guess what? It takes off and goes where? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s headed towards uh George W. Bush&#x27;s ranch. &gt;&gt; And they they reference that.</p>
<p>They reference that in the film. And I not I not only did I interview Ricky Sorel, but I interviewed the reporter who inter who helped break the story. She was later fired, by the way. And Ricky Sorl went dark. He got tired of black helicopters over his house at 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He got tired of phone calls at 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning, you know, telling him to shut up and on and on it goes. That&#x27;s how the game was played when the Stevensville lights happened. You know, this is years ago. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And I interviewed both of these people. So, a lot of what was in the film, you know, I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve written about I&#x27;ve got books about. I&#x27;ve got I&#x27;ve got videos on. So, you know, it&#x27;s just uh &gt;&gt; I gotta tell you folks, this is a coming great deception. &gt;&gt; See, see what we&#x27;re doing now on this program is we&#x27;re breaking it down spiritually.</p>
<p>But when we watched the the documentary, you watched it, other than that one guy with made that one reference to somebody told him it was demons and he almost sort of mocked them for doing that. &gt;&gt; It shrugged it off. So, why do you think that you would go so far as to expose all of this and say you have bodies and say all this and not even mention the abductions &gt;&gt; because they&#x27;re trying to couch it in a way that doesn&#x27;t make people fear. &gt;&gt; And you know, and we have a my my business partner and I, Gil Zimmerman, you know, shameless plug, but we have 10 films on the whole UFO phenomena. We are the only Christian ministry that has 10 films on the UFO phenomena.</p>
<p>Everything from Close Encounters with the first, second, third, and fourth kind. Roswell, there&#x27;s two films on Roswell, Cattle Mutilations, the darkest film I&#x27;ve ever worked on, abductions, and finally, you know, what is the truth? I mean, we we cover all aspects of the UFO phenomena, but from a biblical perspective. And you know, you would think again, it&#x27;s like I was I was walking around the property here in the Santa Monica Mountains a couple of months ago and I was just talking to the Lord. I was saying, you know, Lord, it just seems like most of this is falling on deaf ears. And then I feel the Holy Spirit kind of tapped me on his shoulder and he goes, &quot;Well, now you know how Noah felt.&quot; And I&#x27;m not comparing myself with Noah.</p>
<p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand me. But I just I just broke out laughing. I said, &quot;Okay, Uncle, I get it. I get it.&quot; I go, &quot;But LA, you were so brilliant to have laid the foundation and done all of this work.&quot; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What wonderful resources you already have in place for when people begin to panic.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re panicking. They want answers to questions. And you already have it there documented by video, by book. &gt;&gt; That is so good. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to say two somethings.</p>
<p>My first something is do you not hear Dr. Steven Greer rustling behind the curtain stage right getting ready. He&#x27;s getting ready to come on to the stage at this moment. Right. &gt;&gt; And I want to make a prediction.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Drum roll, please. Look out. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m gonna I&#x27;m gonna predict that LA ends with 33 RUNS OF DISCLOSURE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.</p>
<p>33. YOU&#x27;RE gonna redeem 33, brother. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re redeeming 33. We&#x27;re taking it back. &gt;&gt; Oh, that&#x27;s awesome.</p>
<p>LA, I I I do have And that would be cool if if the Lord was to come back on the on the 33rd uh rung of the &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m just being silly, but that&#x27; be awesome, &gt;&gt; but who knows, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, &gt;&gt; so let me ask you this. Um, you mentioned in your show and they they referenced this as well, the Vatican. You you&#x27;ve talked about it already here. &gt;&gt; One of the things they say in the in the documentary is they say the Vatican itself has strong evidence and in their statements of nonhuman intelligence.</p>
<p>Now, they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re going to baptize them. What role do you see in disclosure and as we go through the further rungs beyond this 25th rung uh that the Catholic Church, the Vatican is going to be stepping in at some point? Does that make does that question make sense? &gt;&gt; Well, no, it does. You know, there are two billion Christians on the planet as we speak. The largest denomination of Christianity is Catholicism. So, that&#x27;s one 1.2 2 1.3 billion people.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s the largest number of people on the planet and uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re going after. So the scenario in my opinion is a nuclear device goes off somewhere on the planet. &gt;&gt; What why is Trump saying, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re going to start testing nukes again.&quot; Why is he even saying that? &gt;&gt; You know, Iran is saber rattling once again. You know, starting up that old nuke program. All they care about is blowing Israel off the map.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s all the Mullins care about it. It&#x27;s insane what we&#x27;re looking at. Hamas and Hezbollah has rearmed and you know they&#x27;re saber rattling again. All it takes is one nuke.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an interesting film that just came out a couple of weeks ago. I&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve been telling people you need to watch this. It&#x27;s predictive programming. It&#x27;s called House of Dynamite. &gt;&gt; Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And in that film there&#x27;s a nuclear event. There&#x27;s a supersonic intercontinental ballistic missile, but it&#x27;s supersonic. It&#x27;s like shooting the bullet out of a gun. Good luck trying to shoot that thing down. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s headed towards Chicago. We never see the missile hit, but the the kill factor is at least 10 to 12 million people. And now what do we do? You know, do we respond? Do we stand? You know, what do we do? So, think about this. If a nuclear event goes off, and I&#x27;ve talked about this, it&#x27;s in it&#x27;s actually the 17th rung of disclosure.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s conjecture on my part, but you have a nuke going off anywhere on the planet. What does that create? It creates the greatest climate of fear that mankind has ever collectively experienced because of the internet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the history of the world, we&#x27;ve never experienced that. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s when they show up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s when they show up and they will say, &quot;We created all life on this planet. We genetically manipulated early man. We started the world&#x27;s civilizations. We started the world&#x27;s religions. Now, at this critical juncture, we are back.</p>
<p>ET, your space brothers are back. No more war. None of this nuke stuff. And we&#x27;re going to usher mankind in a golden age. We know that there&#x27;s going to be a one world government and a one world religious system.</p>
<p>This is this is the the nexus. This is how you this is how you create it in my opinion. &gt;&gt; Are we here? I&#x27;ll tell you something. this we give out these tracks and I want to thank my friend Brad Meyers for he&#x27;s he&#x27;s the impetus behind this thing. So what I&#x27;m about to read is channelneled information.</p>
<p>In other words, it comes through a woman &gt;&gt; who is giving herself over to an off-world entity. In my opinion, this is not possession, but it&#x27;s demonically inspired all day long. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So it says this, we are here. We are the pleadenss.</p>
<p>Okay. Humanity is learning a great lesson at this time. The lesson is, of course, to realize your godhood. Well, as Christians, we know that&#x27;s the lie we heard way back in the garden. Surely, when you eat fruit, you&#x27;ll become like God, knowing good from evil.</p>
<p>So, the enemy, there it is, is is is pedalling the same nonsense he pedled thousands of years ago. So good. &gt;&gt; Then it goes on, if human beings do not change, if they do not make the shift in values and realize that without earth they could not be here, then earth and its love for its own initiation is reaching for a higher frequency will bring about a cleansing that will balance it once again. So what is the cleansing? &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s the punchline. There is a potential for many people to leave the planet in an afternoon.</p>
<p>The people who leave the planet during a time of earth changes do not fit here any longer and they are stopping the harmony of the earth. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; They have just explained the way the rapture of the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;ve just explained it.</p>
<p>There it is. And that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s going to be counted. When I was a newager, you I&#x27;ve been a Christian 45 years, but 50 years ago when I was 25, I was a total newager. I heard this what I just read to you. I heard this 5050 years ago and we are that close in my opinion &gt;&gt; to seeing it manifest.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That is unbelievable. I mean this this is chilling. This is chilling but it&#x27;s also exciting. &gt;&gt; This is not fear. This is for the believer.</p>
<p>This is exciting. We&#x27;re not gripped with oh Lord what&#x27;s it going to be like? No. We need to realize God you blessed us to be that generation. you. We&#x27;re the Daniel generation.</p>
<p>Sell up the book until the days that knowledge shall increase and many shall run for eternity. That&#x27;s us. That was us. &gt;&gt; And LA just packaged this entire thing for you guys and put a bow on it for you. And it&#x27;s not even Christmas yet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Black Friday. BLACK FRIDAY SPECIAL TONIGHT LIVE ON THE BIG PICTURE. &gt;&gt; HEY, LISTEN. He puts out great content every single day.</p>
<p>You need to subscribe to this YouTube. I mean I mean you are just you&#x27;re in a you&#x27;re a machine brother. It&#x27;s amazing. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s on point. He&#x27;s on point.</p>
<p>He is right there with the pulse of what is going on. You guys need to subscribe. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you do. You do. &gt;&gt; So LA, I want to respect your time.</p>
<p>How much you got? You good? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just I&#x27;m I&#x27;m here for you. I mean, this is really important and we need to make sure that we, &gt;&gt; you know, wrap it in a way that &gt;&gt; that the average guy who, you know, isn&#x27;t a theologian &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; just wants simple answer. What am I looking at here? &gt;&gt; Why hasn&#x27;t my pastor warned us of this? &gt;&gt; Think about that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Why? Why weren&#x27;t we told? Why Why didn&#x27;t you address this for crying out loud? Why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, what do you think about LA? What do you think about when somebody comes back and says, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re demonic. You&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s fallen angels and all this. What are the bodies and how what these bodies that they say that they&#x27;re in this film the c the age of disclosure they say people even not say that we have them they say I have seen them &gt;&gt; I have seen the bodies what are the bodies la when in your deep dive of of study this from a biblical perspective help us understand that &gt;&gt; okay years ago years ago decades ago I was trying to figure out what The grays were the gray aliens, the ones with the big heads, the big eyes, the small small bodies, slit for a mouth, two holes for a nose. So I called my friend David Flynn, the late David Flynn.</p>
<p>He passed away years ago. &gt;&gt; And I said, &quot;David, I&#x27;m starting to wonder whether these UFO crashes were deliberate.&quot; In Age of Disclosure, Putoff talks about this. He talks about that some of these crashes are gifts from them. &gt;&gt; He did say that, &gt;&gt; right? He said that so we can back engineer. So walk let me walk you through it and I I would come up to the line and I would run away from it because it was just, you know, there&#x27;s a thing called cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. And some of your dis some of your audience probably is experiencing that right now because we&#x27;re in the deep end of the pool. You know, we&#x27;re not this is not a feel-good happy moment. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re in the deep end of the pool. We&#x27;re talking about the great deception.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about the the machinations of the dragon of Satan. &gt;&gt; You know, we&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s being cooked up in hell&#x27;s kitchen. This isn&#x27;t your best life now, folks. &gt;&gt; And if you want that, go somewhere else because you&#x27;re not going to find it here. At least not now.</p>
<p>and I want my best life, too. But I&#x27;m also aware of where we are. So, we know that the Nephilim are on the earth. We know that. We know that there&#x27;s a seed war where the seed of the dragon is waring against the seed of the woman.</p>
<p>Genesis 3:15, the gateway to the rest of the Bible. So, in Genesis 6, you get fallen angels having sex with human women, creating a hybrid known as the Nephilim. The Nephilim have no soul, in my opinion. They have spirit and they have bodies, no soul. Only God gives us soul.</p>
<p>And because of the progeny of the fallen angels, not going there. So you got to remember when Jesus is talking about it be like the days of Noah when I return, everybody&#x27;s going, &quot;What do you mean? Where are you going? What do you mean when you return?&quot; But everybody, everybody 2,000 years ago who hears that statement, they know exactly what Jesus is talking about. Yes. How do I know that? Because according to the Josephus, the first century Jewish historian, the bones of the Nephilim are openly on display in the time of Jesus&#x27;s sermon to the people. It&#x27;ll be like the days of Noah.</p>
<p>They are openly on display. Why? So when the people would come up into the temple, they&#x27;re not in the temple, but on the way to the temple. So you&#x27;re a 13-year-old boy and you turn to your dad and go, &quot;Dad, what what is this?&quot; And your father would say, &quot;Well, those are those are the Nephilim. Those are the bones of the Nephilim. This is what our far forefathers hundreds of years ago had to fight and clear the land from.</p>
<p>These are the Nephilim.&quot; &gt;&gt; They all knew what he was talking about. Fast forward to the 4th century where you get the knucklehead Julius Africconus and he is a knucklehead who invents the Sethite theory and and then with Augustine spiritualizes everything. There is no seed of a dragon. It&#x27;s all allegory. You know, none of this is literal.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all spiritualized. Blah blah blah blah blah. No. No. Why would Jesus tell us it&#x27; be like the days of Noah? And what differentiates the days of Noah is the creation of a hybrid being known as the Nephilim.</p>
<p>So the Nephilim are the progeny of fallen angels and human women of earth creating a hybrid known as the Nephilim. When the Nephilim are killed in the flood, they come back afterwards. There&#x27;s a second, third, fourth, fifth incursion. It just continues until the cross. Then it switches and changes.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I wrote counter move. How the Nephilim return after the flood. But I digress as usual. So you&#x27;ve got the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim. And the book of Enoch tells us that the disembodied spirits of a Nephilim are the demons that wander the earth.</p>
<p>A demon needs to manifest in a person or an animal or an object. The dragon the dragon knows this. and is thinking to himself, &gt;&gt; I got all these demons &gt;&gt; and they can&#x27;t really manifest in in Earth time in our dimension. However, if I create a biological suit, an avatar for them to go into, &gt;&gt; then they can manifest. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; In in Earth&#x27;s dimension, that&#x27;s what they are. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what they they&#x27;re avatars. this what we also what is also referred to as Ebans extraterrestrial biological entities. &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another very complex question because you&#x27;ve got you&#x27;ve got the grays which I believe are meatsuits, but then you got the tall whites. Tall whites are not meat suits.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, they&#x27;re not. &gt;&gt; No, you&#x27;ve got the insecttoloids. You&#x27;ve got the reptilians. So fallen angels metiscusmatosi I got that word from the late Russar. What is mediscusmatosai? Metiscus modasai is the ability for the fallen angel to present itself and in any way male female and angel of light.</p>
<p>They can shapeshift. &gt;&gt; They can appear. You know why is it that that Paul tells us angels some people will will entertain angels unaware? How does that work? Right? Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s Look, I don&#x27;t have all the answers.</p>
<p>Nobody does. But it&#x27;s complex. &gt;&gt; But what I can tell you is this. The tall whites, &gt;&gt; fallen angels, &gt;&gt; insecttoids, they&#x27;re shapeshifting. They&#x27;re presenting themselves.</p>
<p>Reptilians, you know, they&#x27;re just presenting themselves in a different way. I think that the reptilian is their true form. M &gt;&gt; Nordics metus modesty they&#x27;re shapeshifting to appear as something wonderful and holy and my very first book um Nephilim Metrufis here there&#x27;s a whole chapter in there where this where they walk into a room and there&#x27;s this angel of light just beautiful angel that that&#x27;s there and manifesting and everybody&#x27;s like oh my gosh and finally the protagonist goes in the name of Jesus and just like that, it stops and it it turns changes into its true form. And this is this is look, this is all the deep end of the pool. And I&#x27;ve never seen it.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;ve had one end. Well, that&#x27;s not true either. More than one. Yeah.</p>
<p>As I&#x27;m saying, don&#x27;t remember that. So, I was on a ski lift. I was on a ski lift. Skiing is my favorite thing to do. Okay.</p>
<p>I was on a ski lift. I don&#x27;t know, four years ago, five years ago. It was spring conditions in Mammoth Mountain. Nobody was there. &gt;&gt; Midweek, nobody was on the mountain.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m skiing up and down on this one rung one run just by myself. Peggy&#x27;s on another run someplace, more of a beginner run. And it was kind of icy conditions, but it was still skiing and going up and down and up and down. So, I I ski on the lift and I&#x27;m getting ready for the chair to come around and pick me up. I hear a voice.</p>
<p>Hey, mind if I join you? No, no, come on up. So, this guy comes up and it&#x27;s a four-seater. So, I&#x27;m here and this guy sits here. So, the empty two seats are empty. So, dude, like far up loose, right? So, oh my god, LA&#x27;s doing the devil.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Look out. Look out. &gt;&gt; So, so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m here and he&#x27;s here and there&#x27;s two scenes between us. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>And he goes, &quot;How many days of skiing do you have at this year?&quot; And I kind of puff up my shirt about 14 or 15. You know, I&#x27;m thinking this guy, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ve got 120 feet, you know, days.&quot; I&#x27;m kind like, &quot;What? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; This guy skis every day. He&#x27;s wearing a racing ski outfit, skin tight. He&#x27;s really in shape, but he looks like Chris Kringle. White hair, white beard, sparkling blue eyes.&quot; &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Then he goes, then he goes, &quot;I guess you&#x27;re still working, right?&quot; I go, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And he goes, &quot;What do you do?&quot; &quot;Well, I make films. I write books about the Nephilim.&quot; So I&#x27;m thinking to myself, &quot;Here we go. Now he&#x27;s gonna ask me question. What are Nephilim?&quot; Nope. He doesn&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; He goes, &quot;Have you ever heard of itchy?&quot; Like scratching itchy boots. I go, &quot;No, itchy boots.&quot; Oh, she&#x27;s got 1.2 million subscribers on her YouTube channel. And at this time I had like 120,000 subscribers. We&#x27;re up at 262 right now.</p>
<p>So, um, I go, &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s way beyond my league.&quot; Never met this guy before. Never seen him before since. No idea. There&#x27;s two seats between us. He reaches over and he pats me on my right shoulder and he goes, &quot;You&#x27;re doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. you&#x27;re on the right track. And at this point, I&#x27;ve got brain fog. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m thinking to myself, it&#x27;s like, wait a minute. What is going on here? I don&#x27;t know this guy from Adam.</p>
<p>How can he possibly make a statement like that? You&#x27;re do you keep doing what you&#x27;re doing? You&#x27;re on the right track. You&#x27;re doing the right thing. Seriously? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you kidding? And he reaches over three seats and just gently taps me &gt;&gt; times and anoints me. Taps me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. So, entertain an angel unaware. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s amazing. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Well, LA, where do you see? Okay, so this is the 25th rung. You&#x27;re declaring this is the 25th rung of disclosure. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; What comes next? What do you What is in your gut? What comes next? Good question. &gt;&gt; Well, uh, it&#x27;s a really good question. I think I think Trump and you&#x27;ve already hit your, you know, hit the nail. There&#x27;s no way Trump&#x27;s going to leave us for somebody else.</p>
<p>No, &gt;&gt; this is this is the biggest thing in all of human history. Exactly. No doubt. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s going to say, &quot;I was born for this moment, right? &gt;&gt; I was born for this moment.&quot; &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s going to be He&#x27;s going to be like, &quot;Ain&#x27;t nobody listen, everybody just stop talking. Donald Trump has got something to say that no other president in the history of presidents and no president after me will ever be able to say again.&quot; And I don&#x27;t think he wants anybody else on the uh face of this planet to get out there before him to say this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So in your your gut, you think that&#x27;s next? You think Donald Trump begins &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re Look, Congress is already talking about it. David Grush, who is in the film, you know, stands before Congress. We have non-human biologics that were retrieved from crashed UFOs.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s all there. It It&#x27;s coming down. We&#x27;re back engineering the propulsion system from these things. &gt;&gt; You know, this is why the whole F-35 thing to the Saudis. It&#x27;s a joke.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; trust me, it&#x27;s a joke. &gt;&gt; What they have is so far advanced from an F-35. It&#x27;ll make your head spin if they reveal it &gt;&gt; because this technology and this was number rung number 24. No, number 23 on on the record. So, this UFO is is cruising along like this, but it&#x27;s all lit up.</p>
<p>So, it looks like an orb, but it&#x27;s not an orb. What you&#x27;re seeing is the gravity wave. And when the gravity wave is turned on, the craft just glows. And that&#x27;s conjecture, but that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re watch. And this was shown in the halls of Congress.</p>
<p>So the craft is going like this and they fire a hellfire missile at the craft. So the missile comes in. It&#x27;s all on film and it hits the UFO and the missile just disintegrates. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And the UFO just keeps going. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What do you do with that? &gt;&gt; What do you do? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s why 23. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What do you call that one? Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Man, I don&#x27;t I I don&#x27;t even know where to go now. It&#x27;s just like, wow, &gt;&gt; video gold.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is video gold. &gt;&gt; Video gold. We love it. Awesome. &gt;&gt; So, so LA, we we as we move further and further along in this process, you know, you&#x27;re going to be getting a call from Alabama.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to be calling LA going, &quot;La, LA, look, I could cover this, but if you&#x27;re free, we need we need the man on here to break this down.&quot; Well, you know, look, first of all, I&#x27;m honored that you would say that. But, you know, let&#x27;s give glory where it&#x27;s due, and that&#x27;s to the king. &gt;&gt; This is all I I didn&#x27;t sign up for this. This is the Lord directing my steps, the Lord giving me wisdom. So, all glory to the King.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the first thing. &gt;&gt; But you did say yes. You did say yes. &gt;&gt; And we&#x27;re thankful that you said yes. And I love what you said earlier that it&#x27;s like God knew when this happened there would need to be there would be hungry people.</p>
<p>There would it would be the remnant. Wouldn&#x27;t be a lot of people, but there&#x27;s going to be I need to know the truth. &gt;&gt; And you have a library already ready in video and in book form to explain every single thing people are seeing. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s already there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s already there. And basically, you just go to get anything that he has going. And I think I got his website up here.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s larzulli.net. And when you go there, &gt;&gt; either one. &gt;&gt; Either one. Either one. So this this is this is your &gt;&gt; So tell tell us a little bit about what what all they can see and do when they go here at the website.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I mean there&#x27;s 33 films and and 14 books. We have a special right now. Runs of disclosure. It&#x27;s right there. So you get the two films from Roswell for 30 bucks.</p>
<p>I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a deal. like you can&#x27;t even, you know, it&#x27;s like a $60 value or something like that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, even more. &gt;&gt; And uh, you know, we&#x27;re just trying to make it available to people.</p>
<p>But this is, uh, it&#x27;s coming down, folks. Wake up. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to tell you that that little track that you talked about right there on the right hand side. What is the truth? That that&#x27;s going to be so valuable. I mean, we I&#x27;m I&#x27;m ordering I&#x27;m ordering a bunch of these right now myself.</p>
<p>Uh that is that is going to be so valuable because that&#x27;s a quick way to get it in the hands of people to maybe an give them some answers when all this starts expediting because I think I think it&#x27;s going to be like a snowball. I think it&#x27;s this is &gt;&gt; I agree it&#x27;s it&#x27;s I mean it&#x27;s rushing like this. I mean what do you do with this? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What do you do with that? &gt;&gt; Where where is it going to go? I mean, you know, okay, so Congress is going to go on break and um nothing will happen, but the fact that Age of Disclosure comes out Thanksgiving weekend, everybody&#x27;s going to be watching this thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, and and you and I both and all of all three of us have said multiple times here on the show and to each other and to privately that you don&#x27;t get to say those things unless you&#x27;ve been given permission to say those things. So, so I mean it&#x27;s like they they could have stopped that. The powerful people could have stopped that. So, they let this documentary come out on purpose because that&#x27;s to set up the next rung.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a managed agenda. There&#x27;s no doubt about it. You know, how does an unknown filmmaker essentially Dan Farah get to interview all these people? &gt;&gt; You know, I I I sent our Holy Shroud fire.</p>
<p>Hol holy shroud. Holy fire. you know, we can&#x27;t get the first base. We can&#x27;t get, you know, it just it&#x27;s and that&#x27;s okay. Maybe that&#x27;s the Lord&#x27;s doing.</p>
<p>You know, there it is. Holy shout. Holy sh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>

We really are. &gt;&gt; And quickly quickly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Quickly. &gt;&gt; Look at how many decades there was a stone wall. Yep. &gt;&gt; Nothing could get through and then the drip and now it&#x27;s coming faster and faster.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s amazing. Well, you you uh tell the lovely wife that. Is she Thelma or is she Louise? Your wife. We don&#x27;t know yet. &gt;&gt; We don&#x27;t know yet.</p>

<p>God God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; man. Man, what in the world just happened? &gt;&gt; I loved it. &gt;&gt; That was amazing. I am so excited for this moment.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, I didn&#x27;t know anything about this. I come in, you surprise me with, &quot;Hey, guess what&#x27;s going to happen?&quot; &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let us know in the live chat what y&#x27;all think about having LA on here tonight. That was just phenomenal.</p>
<p>Nobody speaks with that kind of authority in this subject. And I love that it&#x27;s not just authority. He never wavers from his stance on God. It&#x27;s just &gt;&gt; I mean, he is on point. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s on point.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Well, look, I want to I want to continue. We We&#x27;re not through yet, y&#x27;all. We We&#x27;ve got And we got a big big audience watching right now.</p>
<p>And if you if you come in here and you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ve never been to the big picture, go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel, wherever you&#x27;re following it. Show us some love. Hit that like button, share our program, and come back for more programs like this because this is what we do. We just we come we we&#x27;re not ashamed. That&#x27;s why we call it the big picture.</p>
<p>But I want to show you this one one other clip here, and I want to get your reaction to it. Um, this is a clip from the from the video and this is about the misappropriation of funds. And by the way, we are talking about a documentary video that is on Amazon Prime. Several people have asked, &quot;Where do you watch it?&quot; You go to Amazon Prime and you can rent it. It&#x27;s not a part of the free streaming.</p>
<p>Uh, that may be one day down the line, but right now you have to rent it or buy it. And full disclosure here, it ain&#x27;t no $5 rental. It&#x27;s like $18 to rent or like $22 to buy it. and you&#x27;re going to want to break this down. So, just go ahead and spend that extra five, four or five dollars and just buy it and that way you can always go back and watch it, which is what we did.</p>
<p>Uh, I think it&#x27;s a good investment for those that are awake. But this is a clip from it talking about how much how do you get the money? Where&#x27;s the money? And and that&#x27;s a big big deal. So, let&#x27;s watch this little clip. &gt;&gt; The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena. Uh, I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-deade uh, UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How does a program like that get funded? &gt;&gt; Misappropriation of funds. &gt;&gt; Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is set to go to a program, but it doesn&#x27;t and it goes to something else? &gt;&gt; Yes, I have specific knowledge of that. &gt;&gt; Yep. We cannot track $2.3 trillion in &gt;&gt; Let us stop right here because we need to go back and go down that little memory hole that you&#x27;ve been memory holed on. &gt;&gt; Can you tell us the exact date or thereabouts where he said this? &gt;&gt; I believe this date was September the 10th, &gt;&gt; 2001, &gt;&gt; which would be h the day before.</p>
<p>And he said this and then the biggest squirrel &gt;&gt; in the history of squirrels &gt;&gt; that could have happened to sway your mind and distract you from the thought that 2.3 &gt;&gt; trillion trillion dollars couldn&#x27;t be found. &gt;&gt; Do you understand how much money that is? &gt;&gt; No, we can&#x27;t possibly &gt;&gt; we can&#x27;t comprehend it. And he says this the day before 911 &gt;&gt; and not even recently. This was 24 years ago. We couldn&#x27;t find 2.3 trillion.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How many trillion since then? For all you people that wonder how they work on them chemtrails. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re being a little um what is the word? Facious. We&#x27;re not making light of this fateful day. &gt;&gt; Of course not. We&#x27;re just putting the pressure and shining the light on the day before.</p>
<p>Yep. &gt;&gt; In this instance, &gt;&gt; let us continue and let it play through. This is unbelievable. &gt;&gt; Knowledge of that. Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. &gt;&gt; The next day was 911. The very next day was 911. And we never heard about that money again. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it was &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve never heard of it again. &gt;&gt; But I don&#x27;t remember it. It did. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t remember it. Wow.</p>
<p>Did I want to know in the live chat and I want to know in the comments section because we got some people that&#x27;s our age. We got some younger people, too. How many our age or younger do not have any memory of ever seeing Don Rumsfeld standing at a podium, the defense secretary over the military and the Pentagon saying, &quot;We cannot find was it 2.7 or 2.3?&quot; &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; 2.3 trillion dollars. We cannot &gt;&gt; tell you where it is.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s missing and it&#x27;s gone &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s never talked about again. like a mislaid pair of shoes. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Well, there is one other thing that I want to show you and then we&#x27;re gonna we&#x27;re gonna do our normal thing that we do at the end called the supernatural uh AI updates coming.</p>
<p>But we have not watched this program. There is an onslaught of predictive programming right now. I mean there is so many shows that are telling us what&#x27;s coming. We had it with the regular cable shows and all that, but when um it went to the apps, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; and you&#x27;re watching through apps, it is like crazy.</p>
<p>The predictive programming shows just across all genres. &gt;&gt; Multiple people said, &quot;Never heard that. Never do that. Never heard that.&quot; Y&#x27;all, this was a fact. &gt;&gt; You talking about $2.3 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>They said we cannot account for and 9/11 happens. It is. And I hear our grandbabies are here. Our grandbabies are here. Would y&#x27;all like for our grandbabies to come on the show in just a minute? Uh but we&#x27;re we&#x27;re watching them.</p>
<p>But uh yeah, they forgot we&#x27;re on a show. But uh but this is where it&#x27;s going. What are you talking about? Do you want to do you want to come see Papa and Anna? Do you want to come be on our show? &gt;&gt; Come here. &gt;&gt; Come here. You want to come be on our show? &gt;&gt; OH, LOOK WHO WE GOT.</p>

<p>Okay. &gt;&gt; So, we had a big family event this weekend. this past weekend &gt;&gt; and um &gt;&gt; Harper, tell everybody what our big family event was that we had a couple of days ago and you were a big part of. &gt;&gt; Remember when you walked down the aisle? &gt;&gt; Rachel&#x27;s wedding. &gt;&gt; Rachel, our daughter got married.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wedding. &gt;&gt; Wait a wedding. &gt;&gt; What did you do, Harper? &gt;&gt; Well, we were the flower girls and we had to throw the flowers. &gt;&gt; Yes, you did. But Laney was being funny and just started keep on walking and just walked in circles.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Laney, did you do that? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Was you the flower girl? &gt;&gt; No, I didn&#x27;t either. &gt;&gt; What did you do with those flowers at Rachel&#x27;s wedding? What did you do? &gt;&gt; Did you throw the flowers, Laney? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Harper, tell everybody who the ring bearer was.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; We thought he did a pretty good job. He behaved pretty good. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh I was surprised Ringo made it all the way down the aisle to the front and both of you made it all the way down the aisle.</p>
<p>Now, Laney did do a few circles once she got down to the end, but it it worked out. And Papa did pretty good, too, didn&#x27;t he? &gt;&gt; Papa did decent. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m expecting her to say something like, &quot;You are my papa.&quot; &gt;&gt; You are my papa. &gt;&gt; All right.

<p>That was video go. Somebody said this is better than any TV show I&#x27;ve ever seen. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know about that, but that just happened. Whatever it was. &gt;&gt; That That was crazy.</p>
<p>That was crazy. Um well, we&#x27;ve got a couple quick things we&#x27;re going to show you on the Supernatural AI update cuz I know you&#x27;re going to want to end on such a happy note that these are things that billionaires are doing secretly to prepare for the end of the world. Uh, they are building underground bunkers. We knew about that. Uh, they are using life extension tech.</p>
<p>And I couldn&#x27;t believe they used these words. Billionaires are investing in anti-aging gene editing to young blood infusions. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s it. &gt;&gt; Aiming to live longer and forever so they can live along these aliens. &gt;&gt; Okay, here&#x27;s the thing.</p>
<p>And I know you&#x27;re going to read some of this. Okay. They&#x27;ve actually been doing Yeah. &gt;&gt; doing young blood infusions. Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; for a long long time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Not just Young Blood, &gt;&gt; but we&#x27;re going to talk we&#x27;re going to talk about it now. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s okay now. We&#x27;re going to normalize it now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Private space escape plans. Uh they&#x27;re planning on just all like all the movies say, they&#x27;re getting out of here. Underwater data v vaults. Tech giants are storing AI models in deep sea servers and remote island safe zones.</p>
<p>Private islands with helports, solar solar grids, and security teams are becoming the norm. Uh that&#x27;s just one of the things. And here&#x27;s the one that you&#x27;re going to love. Scientists plan to grow extrahuman bodies, and they promise these ones will never wake up. They promise us that.</p>
<p>Uh uh they&#x27;re called bodyoids, which are humanlike structures grown in labs without the capacity for consciousness or even pain. These entities aim to replace animals in medical research, making tests more ethical and efficient. and we share the major updates around the blah blah blah. Okay. So, um yeah, what do you think about these humanoids, humanoids or bodyoids? Bodyoids uh that are going to take over the world.</p>
<p>Uh and they&#x27;re going to know &gt;&gt; you explain this to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to grow extra bodies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they&#x27;re not &gt;&gt; they&#x27;re never going to wake up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not going to have emotions. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to Are we plundering parts off of the What? &gt;&gt; What I&#x27;m trying to say is we don&#x27;t believe this, but this is what they&#x27;re saying. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this this this they&#x27;re not this is whether it ever happens or not. They&#x27;re saying they will never have the capacity for consciousness or even pain. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; will they be ripe for demonic possession? &gt;&gt; Of course.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hey, let&#x27;s go back to La Marzulli. These maybe these are going to be the bodies. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; Scientists have also created here&#x27;s another one another nominee here. Scientists have just created a pill that makes your blood lethal to mosquitoes. Oh, I&#x27;m going to take that pill. Sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, nothing else could happen. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s nothing bad could come out of this to your actual blood. &gt;&gt; Scientists developed a peel that changes the chemistry of human blood. Mosquitoes that bite are harmed before spreading diseases. Early tests show it is effective and safe for human human beings.</p>
<p>I feel so much better about it. Um, and here&#x27;s the good news for all you parents out there. Children are studying for jobs that will no longer exist by 2030. Nearly 30% of today&#x27;s jobs could be automated within the next 5 years due to AI. Yet schools continue to fail to adapt.</p>
<p>So your children are being trained right now. Continue. Many of them are getting degrees for things that will not even exist. So yeah, not a lot of nominees here, but I say one of the nominees for the Golden Chicken Award could be The Age of Disclosure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, totally.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The movie itself. So, all right. So, as &gt;&gt; feels like my house sounds like my house is being torn apart &gt;&gt; because they&#x27;re trying to get back in here. So, we&#x27;re going to expedite the voting. All right.</p>
<p>So, so what are the nominees? &gt;&gt; Tonight&#x27;s nominees are things billionaires are doing to prepare for the end, &gt;&gt; growing extra bodies. Number two, those crazy mosquitoes. Number three, and the age of disclosure. Number four, here we go again. Number one, things billionaires are doing.</p>
