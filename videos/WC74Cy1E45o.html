            <p>well an intelligent program can do that the program already knows it was 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning so it&#x27;s not going to expect that you saw the kind of detail that for example it&#x27;s not going to ask did you see a shadow because it&#x27;s 2:00 in the morning there isn&#x27;t going to be any Shadow and it knows where the moon was and so on so it it can save you a lot of time and have a much more friendly attitude to the poor witness that&#x27;s trying to give you the details of what they saw</p>
