            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Good day and welcome to Reality Check Q&amp;A. I&#x27;m your host Ross Kulart and here to ask me the hard questions my colleague and friend Megan Orata. Good day Megan. How are you &gt;&gt; Ross? I&#x27;m doing great today. How about you? &gt;&gt; Very well, thanks.</p>
<p>Very, very well. &gt;&gt; Well, we&#x27;ve had fantastic feedback from your recent episode with James Fox. I&#x27;m going to hop in. I want to first share a comment from the YouTube page, and I want your reaction to this. This guy says, &quot;If Dr.</p>
<p>Davis has not been assassinated before talking about face-to-face interaction with Alien, that it&#x27;s being allowed to happen as part of the ongoing slow disclosure that by design continues releasing increasingly more details over the last eight years. On this trajectory, the next eight years will be mind-blowing.&quot; &gt;&gt; Wow. I I wish that was true. Um there&#x27;s a great saying, and I&#x27;ve used it before in my line of work. Fans of the show will be familiar with my vernacular.</p>
<p>Um always assume, should we call it a screw- up, a screw-up before a conspiracy. Um I I generally think that um there is no plan, no disclosure plan in place. I I don&#x27;t think that there are people in government who are pulling the wheels and making decisions about disclosure. &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; I think there was a plan prior to the Clinton Trump election 2014 2015 uh that was shelved when the Pentagon and certain people in the intelligence community con realized that Donald Trump was going to become president and I don&#x27;t think uh they saw disclosure as being inevitable because Clinton wasn&#x27;t going to be the president and I think they feared she was going to expose all I don&#x27;t think there is any kind of credible gatekeeper disclosure roll out going on. In fact, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>I think that there is a bunch of gatekeepers who have rationalized in their own alpha male way. This is a secret that is best kept from the public because they really can&#x27;t help themselves and they need to be protected from their own stupidity. So that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important we keep on applying the pressure to make sure that uh the new administration under Donald Trump does ask the hard questions. &gt;&gt; Okay, here is the question. This is from Jessica on X.</p>
<p>Can you share what caused the long delay and getting the film out to the public? Have any more recent edits been made? Secondly, while some deception is sometimes you is used in investigations if it leads to harmful manipulation and discrimination, it is unethical and often illegal. Is there any discussion in this film about the lengths that some have gone to in order to cover up cases where humans were harmed by the phenomenon? &gt;&gt; I presume there she&#x27;s talking about Moment of Contact, the re re-released James Fox film. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Right. So she&#x27;s not talking about Age of Disclosure because there have been huge delays on Age of Disclosure.</p>
<p>So Moment of Contact is a James Fox film that was released, I think, back in 2022. And the interview that we did with James Fox was about the fact that James has been doing incredible great investigative work securing further information with further interviewees who&#x27;ve taken their time to decide whether or not they want to speak publicly about what they know. Uh in in one particular case it&#x27;s um Dr. uh Sylvestri I think his name is the uh it&#x27;s Dr. Italo Sedestri who who&#x27;s the man who&#x27;s made the decision as a neurosurgeon at the regional hospital to come forward.</p>
<p>He originally was too intimidated about speaking publicly and so you can hardly blame James or anyone else really for wanting to um uh get this guy on camera. He&#x27;s been pushing the bloke for years. But it was as James explained to us in the interview that I did with him the other day. It was a decision that was prompted by his own imminent mortality. Literally, the poor doctor was suffering a heart attack, lying on the floor of the ICU, [gasps] and thinking, &quot;Why on earth would I be going to my grave with this incredible secret? The public has a right to know.&quot; And good on him.</p>
<p>Good on the good doctor for making that decision. And we should protect and make sure that whistleblowers and uh people who speak out like him are protected. Um, I think it&#x27;s so important. So, I don&#x27;t think there have been unreasonable delays on what James has done. His film was originally published in 2022.</p>
<p>And what this is is a re-release. It&#x27;s an update of his moment of contact film with some quite extraordinary new interviews. One with the neurosurgeon who was a direct witness to the alleged alien being in the operating theater in the hospital. And the other is the pathologists who did the work on the poor gentleman uh Chavez I think his name was the military soldier who policeman who um died as a result of contracting a bacterial infection from the scratch as he carried the being in his car to the hospital. Um in both of those cases it just takes a while.</p>
<p>Investigative journalism is an iterative layering process. And as I&#x27;ve learned over the years, quite often the best scoops come after the first initial story. People see the story and then they go, you know what, I think I can add to that. And so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s really important. James actually left a an email address.</p>
<p>If there&#x27;s somebody out there, particularly people from the US who were involved in the US Air Force extraction of this being and craft to the United States. James&#x27;s email, if you want to send him a tip, is moment of contact at proton.me. moment of contact at proton.me. or you can contact us here at reality check@newsnation now.com. &gt;&gt; All right, Ross, we have Atlas reaching out to us on X.</p>
<p>He says, &quot;At Ross Coltart, I&#x27;m excited for Fox&#x27;s new movie and the release of Vera&#x27;s Age of Disclosure, but I was curious if you&#x27;ve heard mumblings of any other upcoming projects or hopefully more congressional hearings. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m excited too about The Age of Disclosure. I think it&#x27;s going to be a cracker jackack film EPD by Lou Alzando and Dan Farah. Um, I&#x27;m aware of the people featured in it and I think what people will sit up and take notice of is that this is a film that features people from the very highest levels of the US intelligence, defense executive, people who are speaking out about the reality of the UAP phenomenon. Um, are there other things coming? Well, if we can take one takeaway from what James Fox was saying, it&#x27;s clear from what James has indicated in his interview with me that there are discussions going on on the hill in Congress probably from the opaces of the oversight transparency committee.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s Rep. Luna, Rep. Tim Burchett&#x27;s uh committee which is uh investigating claims of a UAP cover up. Um it does look like from what um James indicated to us that there&#x27;s an effort underway to try and get some of these witnesses from the Brazilian Vajinha case to give evidence in the United States. I am aware of um other goings on uh to try and get other witnesses to come forward in Congress.</p>
<p>But look, one of the big problems and I I keep on saying this, but I think it&#x27;s important to remind people why this has been stymied. Congress has been got at. It has been knobbled. Politicians have been corrupted. They have been induced improperly to not do their job as politicians, as Congress people.</p>
<p>They have breached their obligations of accountability and oversight because they are excessively influenced by the national security states lobbying and inducements. And so also are the staffers inside Congress. Too many of them are beholdened to the jobs that they&#x27;re going to get in private aerospace after they finish their job in Congress. Too many of them see it as a lucrative stepping stone into a private aerospace career where they can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. It&#x27;s a disgrace really when it means essentially that the capacity of Congress to do its oversight role is constrained.</p>
<p>And there was, as we know, an attempt by several fantastic politicians to bring in UAP disclosure laws, laws that would have allowed the protection of other whistleblowers from within the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program, particularly contractors. This was really important. I&#x27;m talking to people who are working for private aerospace companies who are telling me they want to give evidence, but there aren&#x27;t the protections in place in Congress to protect contractors. That&#x27;s why things are being stymied on the hill. &gt;&gt; Okay, we have Charles writing us an email.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s asking, &quot;There continues to be a global conspiracy to withhold classified evidence regarding non-human intelligence be intelligent beings and non-human developed UAPs. What in your opinion would change that position? Thank you, Chuck.&quot; &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s pretty clear. Um, a decision by the Trump administration to take this issue seriously. Um, I think we should take heart from recent comments by uh, Vice President Vance and uh, also previous comments by Secretary of State and now acting national security adviser Marco Rubio. Both gentlemen have indicated and they&#x27;re obviously at the very top of the Trump administration just under the president.</p>
<p>Both men have indicated they have a strong desire to get to the truth of the UAP mystery. And President Trump himself during his campaigning indicated very strongly that he wanted to see declassification of UAP files and the release of further photographs and videos. Uh I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any good reason why the Trump administration so far to date really hasn&#x27;t done anything about this. What I&#x27;m being told by people inside the administration is that they&#x27;ve just been distracted. They&#x27;ve been distracted by trying to resolve peace in the Middle East, the economy, the government shutdown, and of course um uh the ongoing dreadful war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Uh I am assured that this is going to become an issue of concern for the Trump administration. I&#x27;m not holding my breath. I&#x27;ve seen other administrations make similar promises and nothing happens. But one of the things about President Trump is he is his own man. He&#x27;s an iconoclast.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t really care what people think. Uh he&#x27;s very strong in his views and frankly he&#x27;s a deep skeptic um about the people who constitute what he calls the deep state. And if if ever there was evidence of a deep state, if ever there was evidence of a group of people within the national security intelligence community who are misusing their power that is derived essentially from Congress without congressional oversight. It&#x27;s the people who are controlling the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program who are concealing this program and flat out lying to the public. The big worry I have is that there is either a presidential executive order from the Truman Eisenhower days that in some way is being used to gag successive presidents or whether there&#x27;s an ongoing presidential executive directive, a peed, an emergency action directive I think they&#x27;re called, which would essentially mean that there are good reasons for the president to keep this all secret.</p>
<p>Maybe there are agreements with non-human beings as David Grush indicated back in his interview with me in June of 2023. Whatever it is, I think the public have to make it clear that this is an issue that they want investigated. We we have an ongoing crisis now in Europe. Some of Belgium&#x27;s Belgium&#x27;s airspace was closed yesterday and probably still is as far as I know because of drone incursions over all certain parts of Western Europe. Airports are being closed.</p>
<p>And what&#x27;s interesting is the electromagnetic pulse weapons that are normally used to dr down these so-called drones, let&#x27;s call them drones, aren&#x27;t working. So whatever is happening is there is a national security crisis right now in Western Europe where successive governments are finding they cannot do anything to respond to so-called drone incursions over their territory and people are pointing the finger at Russia. Is there any evidence, any solid hard evidence that Russia is responsible for this? I&#x27;m no apologist for an authoritarian dictator like Vladimir Putin, but the simple fact is no one has presented any hard evidence to show that the Russians are involved. It&#x27;s based on speculation. Who or what is responsible for the drone incursions in Western Europe? These are the kind of issues I think that justify why UAPs need to be start taken seriously by governments particularly the US government because sooner or later I think people are going to smell a rat.</p>
<p>Do they want to be fanned out and exposed for the lies they&#x27;re currently telling the public? Or do they want to be leading by the chin and showing leadership and actually exposing the I I suspect illegal and in some cases criminal activities of the people that have been responsible for this program. They may think of themselves as patriots, but are they really? &gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, here&#x27;s an email coming in from Sebastian. Hi, Ross. and Megan, congratulations for your work. Ross, you have stated that according to your sources, the 2004 tic tac near San Diego was Loheed Martins.</p>
<p>However, Commander Fraver said in Lex Freedman&#x27;s at all that there was a gigantic structure below the water and some kind of relationship with the tic tac. That doesn&#x27;t add up to the Lockheed theory unless they have reverse engineered an alien submarine. Can you elaborate on that? Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Look, it&#x27;s a good question and yes, you&#x27;re correct. Um, David Fraver did report seeing an object possibly uh sitting just under the ocean where the tic tac was hovering.</p>
<p>[gasps] I don&#x27;t know if he said that there was a relationship between the tic tac and the object under the water other than the fact that the tic tac was hovering above an area of water that looked like it had something underneath it. Um, it would be speculative to suggest that David Fraver was saying that there was a relationship. I don&#x27;t think he would have any evidence and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever suggested that there was a relationship between that object and the object that he perceived under the water. Um, all I&#x27;m saying is, and I&#x27;ll reiterate this, is that sources have told me that the tic tac that was seen by David Fraver was being operated or controlled by people associated with Loheed Martin. And as I&#x27;ve said earlier, we don&#x27;t know if that means the object was constructed by Loheed Martin.</p>
<p>I actually think that&#x27;s highly unlikely. or whether it was being operated for example psionically by psionics who were in the employee of Loheed Martin which I think is more plausible. Um it also doesn&#x27;t discount the possibility that the other objects that were being seen in the area by my friend Kevin Day and witnessed by multiple people on the USS Princeton and the USS Nimttz. It doesn&#x27;t rule out the possibility that those other objects that were being seen at somewhere between 28 to 80 28,000 to 80,000 ft were of nonhuman origin. I think it&#x27;s highly implausible that they were all Loheed Martin objects.</p>
<p>What I am told is that that day there was a very stupid blueonblue attempt. An attempt to test technology that was in the possession of Loheed Martin against a carrier battle fleet. And this came about as a result of a conversation I had with somebody who pointed out to me and reiterated to me something I&#x27;ve written about in my book that when Kevin Day had a conversation with the I think the admiral or the captain on the USS Nimmits he showed no surprise at all about the incursion by this anomalous object. You have to ask yourself why. &gt;&gt; We have Proctor Hopkins reaching out to us on X.</p>
<p>Has Ross looked into the Project Blue Beam claims and how they could be eerily echoing current events? &gt;&gt; Ah, Project Blue Beam, the most hor chestnut in all of the UFO conspiracy theories. So, um, Project Blue Beam, I&#x27;m assuming this is the one you&#x27;re talking about. There was a Canadian guy, I think he&#x27;s now passed, called Serge Monest, and he came up with this wacky conspiracy theory, and I do think it&#x27;s wacky because it didn&#x27;t happen when he said it was going to happen. I think he said it was going to happen in 1995 or 1996. [gasps] And essentially it was a a staged fake alien invasion leading to eventually a luciferian conspiracy to take over the whole world in some kind of authoritarian world government.</p>
<p>Um he wrote a book called Project Blue Beam and the really cool thing is NASA was the villain. NASA was leading this one world conspiracy. And um look, frankly, I I I think the claims of Serge Monest about Project Blue Beam are a load of hogwash. And I&#x27;m not saying that the idea of a potential staged alien invasion threat isn&#x27;t a possible stunt that might be pulled by somebody in the gatekeeper group that are protecting this legacy program. That&#x27;s long been a completely separate speculation by people like Dr.</p>
<p>Steven Greer from the disclosure project and it goes back to I think claims made by a lovely woman called Carol Rosen who I&#x27;ve had the privilege of meeting who was wa von Brawn&#x27;s assistant and a lot of people have tried to point holes in Carol Rosen&#x27;s claims but essentially Carol was a PA to Dr. Vera von Brawn, the former SS officer who was a Nazi who was brought out under project paperclip and incredibly was protected and given the opportunity to run the entire Apollo space program. And one of the things about Wavon Brawn is he always said that he was reluctantly draoned into the SS. So I should make that point. But essentially, I think he was at the end of his life very skeptical and concerned about what he believed the US government was doing with its knowledge allegedly of nonhuman intelligences.</p>
<p>And he allegedly confided to Carol Rosen, who&#x27;s told me about this, and she&#x27;s told many people about this, including Dr. Steven Greer, who was the first to break it, that um there was going to be some kind of staged alien invasion as an excuse to impose authoritarian control on the planet and that they would use possibly holograms and um projected images of UAP&#x27;s craft as a way of constraining restraining the public and and controlling public opinion. Um is it true? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve got no idea. I mean, it&#x27;s an allegation that&#x27;s been around for years.</p>
<p>I actually don&#x27;t doubt that Wernner von Brawn did say it to Carol Rosen. A lot of people have tried to point holes in Carol, but I find her credible. I think she&#x27;s telling the truth. Um, I do think Weravon Brawn was worried about the potential misuse of the technologies that he allegedly became aware of that the United States was in control of. as allegedly my friend and um in informant Yuri Giller, the famous psychic told me in a previous reality check interview.</p>
<p>He says that he was shown alien bodies by Dr. Wavon Brawn. Um I just don&#x27;t think all of this is complete hogwash. There&#x27;s some truth in this. I just wish I knew what it was.</p>
<p>So yes, I think project blue beam as proposed by a Canadian guy called Serge Monest probably 30 40 years ago is a load of bollocks because it never happened. I think he said it was going to happen in the mid &#x27;90s. It didn&#x27;t happen. But I think that claims that the people responsible for the legacy program might try and stage some kind of stunt. Look, I wouldn&#x27;t put it past if if if Richard Dolan is right.</p>
<p>If our friend Richard Dolan, the noted UAP academic, is right that there is some kind of breakaway civilization on this planet that essentially is using this technology to to gain some kind of superior advantage to the detriment of the rest of humankind, then um I guess it&#x27;s not at all inconceivable that they might try and use some kind of fascist takeover by using a stunt such as a fake alien invasion. I don&#x27;t think we should rule that out. I mean, the bottom line is this is why Congress needs to reassert control over the legacy program and stop pussyooting around and accepting it. It it needs to start digging. What really worries me is the supine dosile way that so many politicians are approaching this issue.</p>
<p>They still titter and giggle nervously when they&#x27;re asked about the UAP issue. And yet the US government has admitted that UAPs are real. There is enough on the public record now, not least since our interview with James Fox and the revelations that he&#x27;s made about a likely recovery of an alien spacecraft and an alien being or beings to raise the very serious likelihood that the United States is lying through its teeth about what it has recovered. And so yes, we should be asking hard questions about what the intentions are of the people that are aware of this program and are they planning some kind of a stunt. I don&#x27;t think we should rule that out.</p>
<p>Um and I think maybe the fact that um Carol Rosen says she was told this by Wner von Brawn and that other people have speculated about some kind of fake alien invasion using recovered craft. Maybe we should take this a little little bit more seriously and maybe this is another reason why government should actually be looking at this as some kind of national security imperative rather than tittering into their coffee cups and nervously looking in the other direction when people say, &quot;Hey, listen. What about this UAP issue?&quot; And this is why you, the public, need to make it clear to your elected representatives that you&#x27;re not going to put up anymore with this kind of nonsensical ridicule response to the subject of UAPs. It just doesn&#x27;t wash anymore. This is a serious subject for investigation and it&#x27;s worthy of investigation by our politicians and our executive representatives.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, we will hop over to X for a question from TJ. Hi, Ross. So, the other day I was meditating and I was struck with a creepy thought. What are the chances that Kenneth Arnold was lying about the saucers he saw during his flight in Alaska? Was it a real UFO sighting or just the beginning of all alien UFO scops? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chance at all that Kevin Arnold was lying. And the reason I say that is because what people have missed and I I came across this when I was writing my book and looking at that that summer of 47 experience.</p>
<p>There were sightings both before and after Ken Kevin Arnold&#x27;s sighting um over I think it was Mount Reineia uh which corroborated what he said he saw. Um there was a forest service warden in a tower uh which was on the same flight path as what Kevin Arnold described and he gave a chronologically exact account of exactly the same movement of exactly the same objects at that time. There were also commercial air pilots and I think there were at least three or four other witnesses that corroborated Kevin Arnold&#x27;s story. So no, I don&#x27;t accept that Kevin Arnold was making this up. I actually do believe him.</p>
<p>And moreover, if people look at the history of the summer of 47, what he was saying was not in any way unusual. This was a period of history where there was just an explosion of anomalous sightings of weird objects. &gt;&gt; All right, we have an email from Caroline in Amsterdam. Hello, Ross and Megan. At the latest UAP hearing, journalist George Knapp mentioned that he had taken with him Russian UAP files.</p>
<p>Do you know if these files are open for the public yet? And are you planning to write a new book, maybe? I loved your inplain sight. Keep on the good digging. &gt;&gt; Good question about George&#x27;s files. Um, I&#x27;ve actually checked this with George directly. So we know that there were I think as George has actually told us it&#x27;s about 200 or so documents or pages of documents that were tended as exhibits into the congressional record.</p>
<p>Now I don&#x27;t know why the full set of thread three documents have not yet been made public as I&#x27;m sure was George&#x27;s intention. But what we do know is that a very limited number of those documents, I think about 22 to 25 pages in total, have been made public and they do not provide the full extent of the detail that was obtained by George. Yet again, the big question is who the hell is it in Congress that is making these decisions? The clear intent of George Knap was to make sure that those thread three three documents were made available for public consumption. Where the hell are they? And who are these anonymous staffers that are making these decisions about what should or shouldn&#x27;t be made public? I I I do think we need to start rattling the cage about this stuff. And it&#x27;s a very very good question.</p>
<p>As for the question of whether I would be writing another book, books are like babies. Um, basically I&#x27;m told by women I love and know, including my beautiful wife, that u uh when you have babies, you only decide to have another one when you&#x27;ve forgotten how painful the last one was. Uh, it&#x27;s the same with books. One of the big problems as well with books these days is so many people rip off books. Uh people don&#x27;t understand that if you spend two years writing a book, often for very little financial reward as an advance up front, um the only way, the only prospect of making any money out of it to compensate you for your time is to hope that somebody might actually buy it.</p>
<p>And the big problem is so many books now are being ripped off. They&#x27;re being copied and digitized and illegally downloaded onto sites where people can download them straight away for free. It&#x27;s a disincentive and it&#x27;s completely undermining the whole publishing industry. While we&#x27;re on the subject, by the way, I received my copy of this amazing book yesterday uh by Andy McGrillin um which is just fantastic. It&#x27;s an atlas of unidentified flying objects and anomalous phenomena.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pear. It&#x27;s got a forward from my friend Diana Walsh Pasulka and it tells the story of a lot of the more interesting UAP sightings all over the world including one of my favorites which is um actually very close to its uh 50th anniversary the uh Fred Valentic story the guy who disappeared over Bass Strait. Um I&#x27;m hoping to have Andy on at some stage to talk about that and and good on him for writing a book. I hope he makes some money out of it. Well, Ross, to put a bow on the big mystery of last week for our loyal viewers, as you can see over my shoulder, I did find your book and secure its home back on the ladder.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Megan. Thank you very much. Nice to see. &gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely. That was the last question for today.</p>
<p>Russ, I am not sure if we will be doing a Q&amp;A next week because you are going on a big trip. &gt;&gt; I am. In fact, I am heading to Peru, Bolivia, and Easter Island doing very much the same kind of tour I did in Egypt last year. We will be bringing you a very detailed story of what we see there, including hopefully some tridactyls. And uh I intend to be investigating the megalithic ruins of those countries to see what we can aduce and what we can find.</p>
<p>More to come. Looking forward to it, Megan. And uh I hope my my fellow reality check Trekies will suffer in silence without Q&amp;A for a couple of weeks while I&#x27;m away. And we look forward to seeing you soon on the other side. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ross. Now, uh, if you do want to ask questions, uh, when we do return, obviously we will store your questions and keep them for a future reality check Q&amp;A. The way to get in contact us with contact with us for with tips or questions is reality check atnewsnation now.com.
