            <p>welcome we are live so um today i start the episode off with some sad news i just recently learned that ningli passed away on july 27th 2021 so about a month ago um on the 27th she was born on january 14 1943 so she was 79 years old and she lived quite an interesting life which we&#x27;re going to dig into and commemorate today um for historians and also scientists who are interested in researching the history of of anti-gravity research so-called so as many of you know ningley worked on some interesting research that happened in the 1990s [Music] this isn&#x27;t it where&#x27;s the so our story essentially starts with ning lee&#x27;s work at university of alabama huntsville and at the university of alabama in huntsville uah is where ningley worked as a superconductor she was i think a phd researcher and uh an expert on super conductors and so ning lee was building the um she was building superconductor disks that were were very large diameter um where&#x27;s the pictures i had of her and these discs so our our story essentially starts with a uah grad student named robert becker who was not a phd i think he was writing his master&#x27;s thesis in mathematics and he was assigned the task of calculating some gravitational effects in a superconductor with i don&#x27;t know the exact nature of his paper apparently i&#x27;ve learned that this that the experiment that ningli proposed to nasa in 1991 was based on this uah uh student robert becker&#x27;s thesis paper um but again it&#x27;s it&#x27;s often that the the phds and and the uh experts you know who are credentialed get the credit while the undergrads who actually did a lot of the work um and came up with the ideas you know never get the credit so um apparently you can go uh and find this master&#x27;s thesis uh his master&#x27;s thesis that ningli&#x27;s work is based on it&#x27;s uh it still exists in only two places uh hard copies there&#x27;s only two copies of it hard copies at the uah library and one is in the public section of the library and one is in the basement in the untouchable archive so so there&#x27;s no way to get it out of there um there&#x27;s people who i know who have copies of this thesis paper but apparently uh this thesis paper was published uh in 19 you know apparently they don&#x27;t digitize their old dissertation docs of anything before 1990 but you can still check out the hard copies if you go to university of alabama huntsville so if anyone is in that area and can go there and find a copy of a hard copy of robert becker&#x27;s uh master&#x27;s thesis paper i think it was probably 1989 that it was published or 88 shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to locate for a uh the right person and uh we get a digitized copy of that for our database because this is apparently where our story begins with uh robert becker&#x27;s work at uah apparently ningli got a hold of robert becker&#x27;s work and this was around the same time that the first high temperature superconductors were actually developed at um at uah you know by the team at university of huntsville so apparently the the guy who actually created the superconductor was a similar idea he was an undergrad you know that that came up with the idea um a really talented undergrad named jim ashburn and jim ashburn um actually discovered the high temperature superconductor and the phds of course uh got the credit for it and are in the history books but if you really want the real history it was jim ashburn uh the undergrad and you know an uh um not an undergrad but uh i think he was you know sec first or second year uh grad student so um but he&#x27;s the one that really invented or came up with the idea for why cbo&#x27;s and then of course you know this being the the place where uh all this had first started happening um ning li was of course the expert on why cbo&#x27;s and uh her her her research um on ycbos and she was the first she created actually a 12 inch diameter ycbo and then she refused to let nasa use that for their um nasa wit brantley and the advanced concepts lab for their replication experiments they used a much smaller superconductor disc if you go and watch the videos i can&#x27;t even find the videos now i was looking for them for you know i lost track of time trying to find them trying to get research for this video but apparently i can&#x27;t find those old videos with whit brantley and nasa&#x27;s advanced concepts lab where they show the little device that they used if anyone knows where to find that video or can find that video please uh please contact me with that but yeah this is some of the deep uh some of the deep research i i thank you guys for joining me and um we&#x27;re going to dig this is a deep dive on ning lee and and getting into the real history so it&#x27;s not going to be super entertaining um i apologize for that but it is i hopefully super informative and in depth and and will give you guys some real you know um meat to dig into so yep hopefully you know people get excited for this because this has been a hot topic there was a video that was put out about two months ago on ning lee um where you know it got me it got like a couple million views and um thanks man i&#x27;m glad i&#x27;m glad you like the content i try to uh i try to keep it as uh as good as on point as possible you know and get could really dig into the people who worked with her so i talked to two people um mainly for this information that i&#x27;m getting my information from as and how i got how i got um inside scoop on this because in this picture here&#x27;s ning lee uh this is whit brantley he&#x27;s dead of course he died in uh i think 2017 or or yeah maybe where&#x27;s whit brantley&#x27;s obituary i had it up here jesus got so many tabs anyways um whit brantley&#x27;s dead now this is tony robertson he&#x27;s actually he actually sits in on our apec conferences uh quite a bit and he&#x27;s now working with a company in midland texas called kepler aerospace and i met up with him out at tesla tech last week actually and had uh a a number of conversations with him including some you know conversations about ningli where he shared some information with me um about the story and um you know kind of what happened with ning lee um and uh this is i i think um that&#x27;s ron ron kozar um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s spelled uh so i&#x27;m trying to put all these names together for people if they want to look this up i retweeted a tweet about um a couple days ago with some of these names so people can look this up you can you can find a lot of their papers if you go and research this but their first paper was um this one i think in 1991 oh no this is the 1992 paper and uh this is pod clitonoff so podclit now i&#x27;ve got word i i think podclitnov actually got word of the research that was being done here and um and came after in his because his research was of course published in 1992 uh but ning lee&#x27;s paper uh papers pre-date podcatnov&#x27;s stuff by uh a year so she was on to this stuff first and then um apparently podcatnav had had copied it and then when nasa got the word that pogba that the right that you know this russian scientist in finland was doing this they had to uh get they got a million a half a million dollars for funding for some of their own research and of course um podclit nov went on to do some you know publish more papers throughout the 1990s and do more research this uh paper was from 2001 and it was published with uh another excellent scientist who should you know be studied if you&#x27;re going to dig into this get his book this is giovanni mo denise he wrote a book called gravity gravity superconductor interactions theory and experiment and it was based on a decade and pro of his research into this you know since getting into it in the early 90s and um and working on it for for a number of years uh well this is actually published in 2018 so this is going to be you know almost two decades of um of superconductor research over two decades because they started in 1992. uh so he&#x27;s been doing this almost uh 30 uh nearly you know 30 years uh 24 years 25 years but um in any case this is the book you want to um i know it&#x27;s expensive but this is the book that i was told to uh get because it&#x27;s of course written by uh you know glenn was an editor on it and giovanni moninis who did the majority of this research is an author as well so definitely go and check out that work uh there but back into this whole thing with um the origins of this 1991 is when um i had this all in in a row and now i&#x27;m going to have to put all the physics paper so yeah so here&#x27;s here&#x27;s some stuff right here so here&#x27;s the 1991 paper and this was published by ningley and douglas torre and again this was based on the math for this was all you can all find this in robert becker&#x27;s thesis paper from uah and that&#x27;s what all this is based on and then they of course got some um you know funding to get into to do to do this and get into it um and this was published uh later but it&#x27;s interesting that there&#x27;s another paper i found going even further back [Music] if you go way back in the literature to this paper right here in physics review letters it was published in actually 1966 and this is the earliest thing i can find on anything related to this superconductors and gravitational drag and i always thought that this was super interesting because it so predates any of this stuff and um it shows that this i these ideas and these concepts that nasa was experimenting with in the 90s with uh with gravity probe b right so um gravity probe b was a test of the frame dragging effect of the earth in space so they built these super fine gyroscopes and they put them in the in this um orbit so that it would follow the earth and they wanted to measure if there was a frame dragging effect when the thing passed behind the earth like the earth moving through space actually you know creates some sort of uh you know frame dragging or dimensional effects and they wanted to actually measure that and see if it agreed with the theory of what what they predicted with einstein&#x27;s theories so apparently it came back and it was yes there is some frame dragging effects and uh there is such a thing as uh what&#x27;s called gravito magnetism or you know gravido electromagnetism uh which is sort of called called gem theory and uh gem theory is this analog to maxwell&#x27;s equations so you have maxwell&#x27;s equations for the electric field and gem theory says well there&#x27;s an equivalent you know this whole theory that there&#x27;s um these the same equations for the gravitational field that when you move you know normally all the gravity we experience is just this you know group this uh this version which is just the electric analog but when you actually move mass through space it creates this frame dragging effect and that frame dragging effect uh can be manipulated to create forces via this pointing vector which is you know a lot of what brandenburg talked about it at his talk at tesla tech this this year and is what you know this the nasa team that you know tony robertson and these guys currently you know 30 years later are are doing douglas torre is um of course has his own website um and he does you know you can check out douglas taurus site here to see what they&#x27;ve been up to but um tony robertson is with of course kepler aerospace who i believe are according to you know their lead theorists i guess is john brandenburg and and stuff so um i don&#x27;t know and tony robertson he&#x27;s he&#x27;s pretty you know well entrenched in this stuff but yeah here&#x27;s kepler aerospace um and this is where these people are today the other insiders who are involved in this who i would argue had more of um you know actually did more of the science than ning li and that ning li um she was known because she made the big the large diameter super conductors but as as far as um you know her actual contributions it seems like douglas tour did a lot of the work and and this grad student robert becker did a lot of the work um for her original you know papers which got her a lot of the media attention and uh she got a lot of the media attention because she was a chinese-american physicist and because she was a woman so it started a lot of rumors about china and anti-gravity technology of course and uh the whole fact that she was a woman contributed to something which i call i call it the ayesha mustafa effect because i did a report or a story on this a couple years back this meme went viral where they took a fashion designer who was this real pretty girl and her name was actually my the same name as this this other egyptian teenager from um who actually contacted both of them and i got a hold of them but there was a case of mixed up identity but apparently they they used the um the really beautiful mo fashion designer girl to say that she was this um egyptian here&#x27;s the meme the 19 year old egyptian physicist aisha mustafa invented a new type of propulsion system based on quantum theory that could propel space probes and artificial satellites and it was really um this um girl who had told this she was in in physics she was a student of physics at this university um i think i forget where the the name of the university is now but you guys can go look this up if if you want but her you know her theory was not her own it was this casmir effect you know idea of using it to create force fields and this is of course related to um how put offs work and bernard haiti&#x27;s work and so many other uh theorists that you know it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t really uh a lot of these ideas weren&#x27;t her own but because she was a female and she was young and they got her mixed up with this when they looked up her name they got her mixed up with this other really pretty girl so they photoshopped a book in front of her um because the book&#x27;s not really in the i think oh maybe it is but swear there&#x27;s another picture i found without the book in it of her um but in any case um the whole story was um it was over embellished because of the fact that she was a female and she was so young and and she was talking about these theories which again weren&#x27;t her own ideas but um she got a lot of fame and it&#x27;d be because the media picks up on stuff like this for whatever reason so i think a lot of that is what happened with the actual um you know story and if you dig through the paperwork and and read you know the science of the people who uh and the publications of the people who are involved and look at where all of them are today you know because ningli wasn&#x27;t the only one working on this she didn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t the only one who knew how to make large diameter superconductor discs that&#x27;s what podclitnov went on to do you know so well and apparently that&#x27;s the reason why some of this stuff failed um they found later on that a lot of this was you know hushed up and and you know kind of covered over on on purpose on the on the surface layer and that um also boeing if you remember boeing had a project grasp capital g r a s p and um if you look up boeing&#x27;s project grasp they in 2002 they got when boeing aerospace got wind to this and started their own research into um you know podcast effect so-called podcanob effect so this has been a research that&#x27;s been going on for like 30 years now and i just want to like show people where it&#x27;s at and the state of the art with it and where they can go look up the the companies now and find out more i i&#x27;m hoping to talk more with these guys it was awesome to meet meet them and actually you know have lunch with them and talk to them and stuff so i definitely want to collaborate with them in um with any kind of publicity that they if they want through my channel i&#x27;m welcome to work with you guys it was awesome to meet you and you&#x27;re all super smart and super nice and it was great interviewing your patent guy on the stream at apec the other night he was super knowledgeable and helpful with that and uh but yeah essentially this is the basis of the theory if you&#x27;re into the physics and and really want to start diving into this and getting into this for beginners that&#x27;s where where to start with these two papers here i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll throw links to this stuff in the description and try to put a chronological um bibliography together for for the progress of this work and um of course the the other people that were directly involved with it that you know perhaps had better ideas about you know the physics than ning lee did uh who get a fifth of the you know not a fraction of the attention even though you know this is the fan that you know it&#x27;s the separating the fanfare um the sensationalist kind of story right here that we got with uh barely sociable&#x27;s video which got 1.6 million views by the way 22 minutes long kind of giving this his version of the story um which was decent it was you know it was better than most but he didn&#x27;t get into detail and talk to the people who were actually worked with ning lee and um and have carried on this research so um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s cool that i i could give you guys a sort of an overview and you know unfortunately to ning li i you know she she did some important work but um you know i&#x27;m not going to embellish uh history that to say that you know she got a lot more credit than i think um was warranted honestly but i don&#x27;t know unless anyone finds anything that&#x27;s you know super remarkable in the literature that um because she kind of faded out after she created this company called ac ac gravity and this is all the official history if you go to her um you know you just look up ning lee everyone knows the you know the the surface story is that you know right in 1999 she left the university to form this company ac gravity llc to continue anti-gravity research and that&#x27;s when she so let me get into some of the what what happened um so we can fill in some gaps according to you know the information that i gotten on ning lee so um yeah again um i&#x27;m just reading through some of this stuff so um so i have some notes from from not going to say who this stuff is from but um i have some information here i want to share um let me see so so darpa refused in the early 2000s they said that they tried to get darpa the defense advanced research projects agency to fund a repeat of the pogblatinov um impulse gravity generator experiment so this one is is is much later all right so this is early 2000s that this impulse gravity you know exp paper came out i remember getting a hold of this when i was you know early physics student and i remember getting excited um but again they they tried to get dart but funding for it that darpa turned him down because they said it was unbelievable and therefore unfundable um because they couldn&#x27;t come up with a believable enough stuff but if you want to um apparently the paper to read on this if you really want to get educated is um yeah again this is the wired magazine article which i linked to in the description but the the paper that you want to read is this one right here um it&#x27;s in this book but i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll cite this paper um is that it no that&#x27;s not it this is it right here so yeah it&#x27;s in this book and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the the paper you want to read um so let me just get a couple of things so um at chapter four you can uh read the part on gravity um on gravitational waves and inside of superconductors and how and what they&#x27;ve calculated for gravitational waves inside of superconductors and bozeins bose einstein condensates um let me just see one thing here um i wanted to get into the the um so ningli was tasked under the nasa superconductor project to make the large superconductor disk but she refused to give nas nasa the disks she made which is the reason that that project failed i mentioned that dr campbell i don&#x27;t want to talk about dr campbell and dr smalley who they&#x27;re i think that one they might both be dead but they uh they worked at uah with um ning li and they were cited in in some of the i think the popular mechanics article for their statements about you know why certain certain ideas that they had early on like gravitational shielding were were later thrown out and now they&#x27;re working with different theory um so a lot of these a lot of these older ideas you may read about but you know that&#x27;s not where necessarily the research is is at currently you&#x27;ll also find patents like this one that were patented right around the same time you know this stuff started coming out um patents went out for gravitational shielding and control devices based on on this uh research cited you know these papers were cited in the uh literature for the statement you know for the research report so you can look that stuff up as well i&#x27;ll post a link to some of the stuff in the description um let me see what else did i want to go over so people get the the gravito electromagnetism thing the basis for why that why they believed that these superconductors would create a gravitational drag again it goes back i think they were doing experiments with this even earlier on um in secret i think that maybe it goes back to 1966 because this guy bryce dewitt of north carolina chapel hill i think that they might have been connected with some work that was being done in pennsylvania by a guy named henry william wallace who has two patents that he patented for generating dynamic force fields via um the secondary gravitational field and it&#x27;s based on this gem theory stuff you know that that an analog of maxwell&#x27;s equations so interesting stuff again ningli um perhaps there was rumors i guess she did go back to china for a period of time um and it was because she had gotten sick i i had heard and then i um i heard that that somebody saw her more recently and um so let me see ningly all right so here&#x27;s a letter from somebody that knew her said ningli told me that she went back to china for health reasons it was according to her breast cancer um that was you know but came back to huntsville this was prior to 2008 in 2008 nasa forcefully uh realigned um his this this source and others so after 2008 he was no longer involved in any advanced superconductor experiments or had any conversations with ning lee um he met him said he met a young man about three or four years ago who said he talked to ningli in huntsville about six or seven years ago so apparently she&#x27;s been living in huntsville since you know 2008 or so she she moved out of the country for a couple years apparently because of health reasons since maybe uh to to be with family and stuff but i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence that we know of in le you know that she this is this could be a time period though um i i i will admit this could be a time period that she could have gone to china with some you know and talked about this research so i wouldn&#x27;t i wouldn&#x27;t i wouldn&#x27;t put it past the chinese government to just to depose her i mean i was a undergrad student just where you know and i had no i knew had knowledge of this when back in the early 2000s when i was in college so i assumed that the chinese authorities you know and their spies would have had knowledge of this and would have completely deposed her when she returned to china it&#x27;s not um it&#x27;s not unreasonable to believe that that that is what happened but um according to the scientists who i know who worked with her um this this kind of the theory and you know a lot of a lot of her theories were based on you know other people&#x27;s work and uh weren&#x27;t the best theories either they didn&#x27;t pan out 10 years later after experiments um where a lot you know thousands of hundreds of thousands of dollars were put into this research you know and um perhaps even you know more than that and over a decade and and a lot of that research is published in this book cumulatively if people want to um are interested in that and want to want to get more information on it so uh again i reached i encourage you to you know research research and maybe if you if people are journalists are trying to get in more information reach out to the people that actually worked with ning and um and get their side of the story as well don&#x27;t just listen to me and and my second third hand information um but do uh do know that i am close to some sources that were very closely connected with her and uh i wouldn&#x27;t just make stuff up you know we don&#x27;t do that here on this channel but anyways yeah um who&#x27;s the any i want names on paid troll um i i know that there&#x27;s people that um went missing and stuff but i have names for you know pretty much everyone that she worked with who is of any importance and including people that you know i i apparently uah is a hotbed for a lot of this kind of stuff and there&#x27;s a lot of really if you&#x27;re into zany physics research and you want to get inducted into black programs again right wright state university you know uah university alabama huntsville these are the these are the places you want to apply for college and go to college if you want to get connected uh to these kind of and work on this kind of stuff professionally so kids you know study lots of physics and calculus and math and do your algebra homework um because it all is important but um yeah bryce dewitt is interesting so i want to talk i guess i could go into a little bit more on bryce do it because um amazing that bryce was on to some of the stuff way back when and um i think that he was connected to a lot of the black world physics stuff uh through just through some of the people that i&#x27;ve connected him with over the years and um it really a lot of this this history should be looked up and more foias should be filed with his name in it and in connection with a lot of the stuff that he was connected with because uh in any case um yeah felix bloke he was one of the guys that worked on nmr for the government but um bryce stewart had worked with uh alongside john archibald wheeler on a lot of the early quantum theory work on on quantum gravity so the wheeler do it equation is um also known as the einstein schrodinger equation it was called because it&#x27;s basically like a wave equation over the entire universe so it&#x27;s basically explains the entire universe in terms of this wave space which is really interesting because it it deals with this whole other version of reality where the entire universe is just a matrix basically this and they can do weird things in the matrix by these weird transformations um which might be explained by these meta materials on you know are are being proposed for these alien ships that can teleport or you know warp drive and stuff like that because this might be the physics they were on to back in you know the the 50s and 60s and um when there&#x27;s a whole conspiracy theory that you know they pushed mainstream these guys pushed mainstream physics off a cliff with string theory and all these other um dark matter and all that stuff when in reality they they were pursuing a different type of physics based on on these these league groups and this stuff&#x27;s published in um battelle um in patel archives if you look up patel ren ren contres these 1967 lectures in mathematics and i have a copy of this it&#x27;s 557 pages but if you download this this is 1967 this is a year after that you know superconductor paper was published by bryce dewitt he&#x27;s in he&#x27;s giving a lecture in france i think with four battelle put on with john wheeler and by john wheeler and bryce dewitt and in the battelle ren contreras he they talk about league groups re-algebras right so that&#x27;s the uh the whole that&#x27;s the whole thing that garrett lisey you know figured out was you know very similar to how quantum particle interactions work and particle transformations work in in quantum physics and quantum field theory and that there&#x27;s this sort of group theory matrix sort of a way of visualizing connectivity and uh and spatial dimensions that creates all the particles and and through purely mathematical uh geometric under underpinnings and this was you know kind of alluded to and and talked about you know wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t well constructed and well as you know well drawn out as some of the grad work i&#x27;ve seen out of garrett lisi and and others but it was certainly a good start to a lot of that type of thinking and it was decades ahead of its time which is um you know sad that we we could have maybe you know learned more about this and had this you know but again the material science didn&#x27;t get us there until the early 90s when we created the first you know ycbo which you know could be super conducted at 35k so that that really reduced the um equipment necessary to do superconductor experiments you know so now we&#x27;re able to do super conductor experiments in our lab you know and they&#x27;re not super expensive so again we wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that if it weren&#x27;t for the material science aspect of this which didn&#x27;t come until um years later so that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s one argument is that we didn&#x27;t quite have the material science because the material science has to like kind of i mean it&#x27;s always years ahead at the universities because they have like equipment to do kind of advanced research and stuff like this but it&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t see like mass production until there&#x27;s a you know until there&#x27;s a market for it in the real um physical world so it&#x27;s you know the market for super conductors there is one because lots of people like to do experiments with them but um as we found out you know they&#x27;re really expensive because it&#x27;s not a lot of people who build them and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re pretty expensive to make as well so um in any case they&#x27;re not completely unattainably expensive which is the good thing but um anything else that uh people want me to address um hey thank you for the three dollar super chat man that&#x27;s awesome so rex alley fredrickson never heard the name before i look up i&#x27;ll look him up man i don&#x27;t know why man i gotta invite i gotta add more mods all right well let&#x27;s open this up to open discussion um i mean people want to come in and at you know jump on the stream there&#x27;s a stream yard link people want it i don&#x27;t have a patreon i i&#x27;m gonna set one up um i would like to uh let me see what we got here hold on um i would like to uh pause that all right i&#x27;m gonna add uh i&#x27;m gonna make i&#x27;m gonna give you a wrench alien girl you&#x27;re a mod now sweet so um yeah join up there&#x27;s the uh there&#x27;s the link for the stream yard if you guys want to join up we&#x27;ll do it i guess we&#x27;ll do an after party discussion on um unningly but again guys look back to the literature and uh just the names and the stuff that i&#x27;ve gone over because i&#x27;ve got some inside information on the real ning lee story and i i just wanted to spell the some of the rumors that you know she went to work for china i heard that she actually went to um she didn&#x27;t go to in china for long she went there for you know a brief period of time but she had i heard that she was working for applied materials again these are just rumors that i&#x27;ve heard over the years but applied materials is a company out in california but i i didn&#x27;t i don&#x27;t really have any evidence that she lived in california or anywhere besides huntsville in the u.s so again people want to reach out to her family and try to get some information uh directly on on you know but her whereabouts she she she died in in huntsville and apparently she&#x27;s been there for the past you know since at least like 2008 or so so i think she&#x27;s been just retired i don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s been working professionally or doing much but i assume it was breast cancer because the cause of death isn&#x27;t given but applied materials is um an interesting company and they would have certainly been interested in ning lee&#x27;s knowledge about you know making large diameter superconductor disks so again um something worth looking into uh there&#x27;s still some mystery surrounding ning li again although the people that i&#x27;ve talked to that were really in the know and worked with her and wrote the wrote these papers with her um according to them you know again it was robert becker the grad student who will get his paper and put it up um in the links and um and these other guys that aren&#x27;t well known you know who did a lot of the work like um in any case yeah i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t want to keep it going too much longer than this because uh we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll set up a patreon and um i&#x27;ll i want to get like some maybe i&#x27;ll post my my bitcoin address so people can send me some bitcoin bitcoins hot right now i could i could use a little bitcoin so yeah applied materials is hiring if you guys want want jobs and stuff this is these are the companies that are you know doing this kind of stuff you know so there&#x27;s lots of companies out there hiring you know if you want to get involved in this stuff and if you if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re on the boots level entry level you want to go to school for it um i again i i tell you i&#x27;ll tell you the places that you want to apply and where you want to go to meet the right kind of people it&#x27;s a shame man that so many of the people that were involved in this were dead are dead they&#x27;d be great to get eugene podcliton off to present on apec we&#x27;ve been trying to you know reach out to him and you know he&#x27;s been sharing some things with the group and stuff for his work but he&#x27;s not really super about getting attention or putting his you know he got he got already enough quite a bit of attention he doesn&#x27;t really want a lot of fame out of this so he&#x27;s kind of which again we&#x27;re not really about you know we&#x27;re not a huge channel we&#x27;re just uh you know we only got we got less than 200 people watching this live so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more about the information on this channel it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really then the viewership i could care less about how many people watch me as long as it&#x27;s the right people watching i love all you guys thank you so much for being here and uh being a part of this and again share any information or inside you know scoop that you have and try to connect me with sources and jump on the stream i posted the link and then you know they&#x27;re in in the chat and uh and uh thank you
