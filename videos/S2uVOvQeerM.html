            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel and uh we tend to focus on theories of everything and uh these are all-encompassing theories that uh give you a holistic View and um trying to almost synthesize them over time uh where you know if you have a theory of everything uh and somebody else has a Theory of Everything they probably are saying the same thing if they&#x27;re accurate but they might be using different languages different terminology different um emphasis and so uh when we do some com comparative uh theories of everything then we might be able to kind of boil it down and uh you know uh come to a an internal understanding of how these things work we started off doing many many videos on the ancient Egyptian Tree of Life and now we&#x27;re working on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and this is the I believe the 280th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system Mr Larson was an engineer back in the 20th century and um about 1930 he had some um insights that he pursued and eventually wrote up his fundamental past two fundamental postulates back in the late 1950s from which he began to write books and um wrote uh double-digit books and uh maybe 50 or so articles gave a lot of talks and developed a little bit of a following but mostly was ignored and or ridiculed by the scientific establishment um for no reason and uh died in 1990 um his uh his work was uh continued on by some of his small group of followers uh probably the two that have done the most work are Dr kbk nehru and Dr Bruce Perrette and uh we&#x27;re going to be looking at one of peret&#x27;s Articles today um but uh to just Backtrack on Larson&#x27;s Theory the basic idea is that uh we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s made out of motion motion for Larson was the relationship between space and time this is a reciprocal relationship space and time are basically the same thing two polls of the same thing if you increase your space you decrease your time and vice versa they have a reciprocal relationship just as the same as uh um they&#x27;re basically a fraction motion is a fraction uh or a ratio of where space or time is the numerator and time or space is the denominator and um with a few stipulations one is that space and time both are in three dimensions space and time both have their scalar aspects scalar motion is a motion with a magnitude but no particular direction and you could think of that like a clock clock time time is always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction and uh you can also think of that in space as a balloon with a bunch of dots on it you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other space is always moving away from each other but in no particular direction and this was actually observed by the Hubble telescope in the 1920s as all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and like Larson would say uh you know in this uh from our general perspective we see space up close and we see time very far away but with that Hubble Telescope um that the space all the distant galaxies are moving away from each other that is the distant view of space and then if we saw time up close we would see three dimensions of time and uh then the third stipulation is that um timing space only come in discrete units or they are quantized there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit then you don&#x27;t have have anything so you have to have at least one unit to have anything and then if you want to go to two units you have to have at least two if you only have 1.93 then use only have one um and [Music] um that results in uh what Larson calls unit speed one unit of space in one unit of time is unit speed or the speed of light speed of light is one over one equals one and for Larson the speed of light was the midpoint or the null point or the neutral point of the universe whereas for legacy science the zero the the neutral point is zero but for Larson and it makes sense the universe of motion if if the universe is made out of motion that means that motion precedes everything else so before you have anything you have motion and that is a little bit counter-intuitive because you have to be able to accept the fact that you have motion even before you have anything moving the motion become the motion comes before there is anything to move and the the thing that you are moving eventually is motion in and of itself a matter is just one variety of motion as is energy those are both varieties of motion as a speed acceleration force uh pressure density electrical capacitance magnetic permeability permittivity capacitance these are all resistance these are all forms of motion and they are all expressible exclusively in terms of space and time matter is time to the third power over space to the third power energy is time over space force is a time over space to the second power whereas acceleration is space over time to the second power uh pressure is time over time over space to the fourth power and on and on and on and that uh whole system there uh is is a is a Quantum improvement from the MKS system because now you&#x27;re just using two variables time and space and you can use that that uh General format to check all your equations you know does the equation check out in terms of space and time you know a simple example E equals m c squared energy equals matter times the speed of light squared energy is time over space matter is time to the third power over space to the third power c squared is the speed of light speed is space over time the car is moving 10 miles an hour but that&#x27;s squared so you have space to the second power over time to the second power you multiply that all out and it balances so that equation is at least valid uh in terms of the units and so that provides a very good check for your system now um when you do have uh the speed of light as the neutral point or the midpoint that means that you have um two sectors of the universe you have the material sector where everything is moving slower than the speed of light and that&#x27;s the sector of the universe that we&#x27;re familiar with that&#x27;s the sector of the universe that where Einstein is saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and so that&#x27;s the sector of the universe that Legacy science is familiar with that&#x27;s where we have our coordinate space our three dimensions of space and our clock time clock the clock is always getting later and later and later these are uh relations that we&#x27;re familiar with but then there is also an equally large sector of the universe where most at all motion is faster than the speed of light which would have been an Abomination for Einstein and many other physicists out there and in this sector of the universe um which Larson called The Cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart we know nothing about this sector of the universe basically but using that type of extrapolation we can figure it out because what is going on in the cosmic sector is exactly the same thing as what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that you just have to reverse the roles of space and time and so Larson did a lot of work with this Cosmic sector to um basically uh flesh it out and determine what&#x27;s going on there um and so he has a lot of um a lot of material on anti-matter uh what largely calls Cosmic matter cosmic rays cosmic ray Decay um but also the uh the cosmic sector in terms of uh light life units so for Larson life is a stable combination of a material and Cosmic uh grouping uh material unit and a cosmic unit grouped together now normally when you put together a cosmic and a material unit they annihilate each other that&#x27;s your basic matter anti-matter interaction but if they are directly out of phase and in the right proportions um then it turns into the life unit in licensed terminology uh we got into all that when I read over his book called beyond space and time as his last book and if you go back in the archives about four or five months uh you will see many many many videos that I did on his book beyond space and time um okay now today we&#x27;re looking at uh Bruce Perez uh article now Bruce perrett along with nehru after Larson died particularly after Larson died uh they uh started to um extend Larson&#x27;s Theory into different areas but uh and also to correct certain aspects of Larson&#x27;s uh deduction from his initial to fundamental postulates and uh came up with what they call rs2 the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system now this reevaluation stays true to the spirit of the reciprocal system but make some changes in terms of some of the details and some major details as well uh the structure of the photon is one of the major things the geometry of the universe is another um and the Scale of the Universe both in terms of time and space are all things that the reciprocal system to has you know revised from Larson&#x27;s now when Dr perett wrote he wrote many articles under his own name but he also wrote many articles under the name of Daniel Phoenix three which was a character I don&#x27;t know whether it was a real character or not um but uh Phoenix 3 project was a top secret government uh project that included The Philadelphia Experiment or the Montauk project and which was a time travel project that uh went horribly badly in the early 1980s and um we&#x27;re reading one of Daniel uh Daniel&#x27;s articles that is called geoengineering Chemtrails harp h-a-a-r-p World orders timelines and Ascension and uh we read the first installment of this yesterday and so if you want to get back to the very start of the article uh you want to watch yesterday&#x27;s video before watching this one we&#x27;re going to be taking over on like the third page and um he was mentioning how in Larson&#x27;s uh book Universe of motion which is his book on astronomy one of his books on astronomy um Larson sets out that the uh Stellar Evolution and Galactic Evolution uh the Legacy Sciences uh model of Stellar evolution is backwards now you may know the uh the little saying uh oh be a fine girl kiss me that is um you know an acronym for OB a f um g k m that those are the classes of stars and the evolution of the Stars you know the the star star out as o stars and then they become B stars and then they become a Stars and then F stars and so on um in Larson&#x27;s system that scale is backwards and so actually the O star is the final uh destination uh and B is the second to last a is the third to last and so on and so that plays a part in this uh uh he uh paret just got done discussing that and uh he&#x27;s gonna move on from here as a consequence to uh setting the Stellar evolutionary sequence straight some conclusions are different than popular belief one star Stout start out as large dust clouds condense into red supergiants orange Giants yellow then white main sequence Stars then on up to blue giants then supernova the same process as heating up a piece of metal from the initial red glow to where it gets blue hot and breaks two since stars are built from dust and debris as fuel the more fuel available the hotter the sun will get three as a David Wilcock uh who you may know as an author uh he was actually um a friend or at least a housemate of uh Dr Bruce perrett and I think learned um Bruce perratt was basically one of his informants and he taught Wilcot Wilcock the reciprocal system um but in my opinion Wilcox never really picked it up um to the its full extent uh otherwise he would have homed in on the reciprocal system and learned it uh learned it a lot better and started stopped messing around with other other theories uh but anyway as David Wilcock has identified in the past planetary moons are leaving trails throughout the solar system indicating we&#x27;ve entered a Dusty area of space with all this dust and debris available for Stellar fuel the sun is growing in size and getting hotter moving from a class G yellow star to a class F yellow white star and four because our system of long-term dating is based on an assumption of radioactive elements being formed when the Earth was born not being produced regularly our system of geological eras is drastically wrong astronomical events move thousands thousands of times faster than assumed by astronomers the planet and solar system are nowhere near as old as claimed and Mankind has been around uh to see the Sun change in the past now that is kind of an extension from Larson I don&#x27;t believe Larson came to that conclusion uh but it does flow from the reciprocal system and the idea of uh how radioactivity Works Larson did write on radioactivity um but I don&#x27;t believe he questioned the um Legacy scientists scale and how they actually were determining half-lifes um but peret did and he determined that say like uranium I think 235 supposed to have a um half-life of like 4.5 billion years and that&#x27;s kind of where we got the uh uh the age of the Earth um paret kind of uh went through a process of redefining how um how that was measured and uh determined that uh the scale was off by thousands like 4.5 billion years was was in the millions of years or possibly even in the thousands of years I think millions of years um and um when you consider these consequences from a corrected Stellar Evolution one conclusion is obvious global warming is not due to flatulent flatulent cows but due to the fact that our sun is getting hotter and will continue to get hotter okay this next section is called sun heats in Quantum steps not a smooth transition in the reciprocal system everything is quantized into discrete units so is the case with the destructive limits um now last time you mentioned that uh each each element has a destructive limit and so um that determines kind of how Stars uh evolve because um certain elements are more populous than others and when uh an element like iron which is much more populous than uh even all the all the elements after it combined um when it when iron gets to its destructive limit uh it results in what is called a supernova anyway so so is the case with the destructive limits stars do not heat smoothly but tend to stay at a specific temperature then suddenly jump to a new temperature range as the magnetic ionization level increases which controls the age limit okay there&#x27;s also an age limit there&#x27;s a temperature limit and an age limit of matter now when it gets to a certain age limit then uh there&#x27;s a different kind of supernova that has is a result that is why we have a distinct color temperature class system for identifying Stars the discrete jumps become very visible when you look at an HR diagram which is a legacy diagram that they usually use to map out Stellar evolution when you look at an HR diagram with the correct evolutionary sequence as stars move from red giants to orange red supergiants to orange Giants to the main sequence uh distinct bars on the graph with few Stars between them the earlier stages of heating up take bigger jumps than the later ones so that is obvious here astronomers consider the Giants to be separate from dwarfs because they do not realize the star&#x27;s heat and condense in Quantum steps they assume a continuous change so they miss the connection okay this section is called radioactivity accelerating to faster than light speeds conventional understanding of radioactive elements needs some updating in the reciprocal system when you accelerate matter past the speed of light it becomes radioactive it emits radio waves while it is throwing off particles that&#x27;s why they call it radioactive radioactive it has to do with the fact that the zone of isotopic stability inverts when you cross the speed of light Atomic explosions in the Stellar interior are violent enough to push motion past the speed of light something that cannot be accomplished by electromagnetic means in particle accelerators okay that is a paragraph that probably could be an unpacked uh each sentence uh you know needs some explanation but I think he&#x27;s going to use an example and try to clarify some of this for example take uranium-236 uranium is element number 92 so it&#x27;s natural mass is 184 twice the element number and the remaining 54 units of mass are isotopic mass an accumulation of mass uh or neutrinos that forms the u-236 isotope of 184 plus 52 equals 236. so if you have u236 you have um 184 mass units is because of the atomic mass and then 52 of the units are isotopic Mass and Larson has a formula for calculating the uh the isotopic mass once u-236 is accelerated past the speed of light the inversion takes place and the stable Zone becomes 184 minus 52 equals 132. so the atom has to throw off a hundred four units of mass to become stable at faster than light speed so as soon as it crosses the speed of light it becomes massively unstable and this throwing off of atomic mass isotopic mass is called radioactive emission uh let me uh let me look at some of the footnotes here before moving on um back to the global warming thing one of his footnotes about nine minutes into Jesse Ventura&#x27;s conspiracy theory television program global warming uh he interviews a reclusive climate scientist who has come to the same conclusion it&#x27;s not the sun it&#x27;s the Sun not man that is the cause of the warming and then um he&#x27;s talking here about um radioactivity has to do with the way magnetic ionization affects elements as a second power function uh I think this is using this concept called equivalent space um with no ionization elements up to element 118 are stable in Larson&#x27;s system there are 118 elements I think the scientists have only discovered about 105 of them and every one of them above uranium is unstable and doesn&#x27;t really exist in the natural environment but can exist like in a laboratory setting but in Larson&#x27;s system there are actually 118 elements that are that are stable or that are that are potent in potential but in our environment with a magnetic ionization of one only 92 of them are stable but if we went to a place in the universe where the um magnetic ionization level was Zero then all 118 elements would be stable if we went to a place where the magnetic ionization was two then um I believe uh only elements uh I believe gold is element number 79 and it would be all elements below gold are stable and and then numbers 80 through 92 would also be unstable at the magnet ionization level of two and then if you go to Higher and Higher and Higher magnetic ionization levels fewer and fewer elements would be stable according to an equation that Larson is derived um here he does say with with unit magnetic ionization everything from uranium up becomes radioactive 27 Elements which is current ionization level for Earth at two units everything from gold on up is radioactive only 13 more elements added to the um the fuel source and it diminishes from there if you think back to the days of Bob Lazar and his claims that UFO propulsion used elements 115 well 115 has a natural mass of 230 and an estimated mass of 288 meaning there are 58 units of isotopic mass 115 is highly unstable at speeds less than light but only has a mass of 172 at faster than light speeds where you invert and you take the 230 and subtract the 58 instead of adding it so it is completely stable at faster than light speeds pull it out of the reactor though and you&#x27;ll be bombarded with x-rays to the point of glowing in the dark this is why the faster than light drives are never shut down which brings me to the reciprocal process matter dropping from faster than light to sublight speeds and then the next section is called x-ray emission faster than light to sublight speed and we will get into that starting tomorrow um so thank you for tuning in today and uh tune in tomorrow to find out more about uh x-ray emission radioactive emission and um have a great day</p>
