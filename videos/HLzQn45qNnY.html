            <p>What are you most interested in? What technology right now is sort of grabbing your attention? &gt;&gt; I I&#x27;ll give you a macro uh uh uh technology and and a very tactical one as well. So, uh uh on the macro level, um you know, China&#x27;s uh uh uh uh came out a few years ago and said, you know, Europe won the uh industrial revolution in the 19th century, and that&#x27;s why they were the world leaders. The US won the IT revolution in the 20th uh uh uh century and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve been the the global leader since World War II. Uh uh we believe that whoever wins the bio revolution is going to be the leaders in the 21st uh uh century and we China want to do that. Uh uh uh so I think one of the most interesting areas of technology right now is what&#x27;s going on in bio.</p>
