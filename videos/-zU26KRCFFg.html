            <p>What if electricity was free for everyone on Earth? Nicola Tesla believed it was possible and he almost made it real. In 1901, he built the Warden Cliff Tower to beam wireless energy across the globe. No wires, no power plants, just clean energy from the Earth itself. But when JP Morgan realized he couldn&#x27;t put a meter on it, he pulled the funding. The project collapsed.</p>
<p>The tower was demolished. But imagine a world where power knows no borders, no fossil fuels, no blackouts, no energy wars. Just Tesla&#x27;s dream lighting up the planet wirelessly. What if we gave him the chance? Follow the veiled varities for more lost truths and hidden histories.</p>
