            <p>So, the best evidence um I would say some of well I there&#x27;s a lot of the best evidence but stuff that I&#x27;ve been involved with with Skyatcher where we make this supposed call and then things show up within a time frame posted and then I&#x27;ve got pictures of things like right next to the helicopter uh that showed up uh or just coincidence of this on one of our separate events when objects were seen and we have pictures of the stuff flying by rapidly. I mean, because it&#x27;s moving so gosh darn fast that all you see is it across perhaps two or three frames of a of a rapid camera um moving and it&#x27;s not a bug, so I don&#x27;t care what anybody says. Um, so it&#x27;s those kinds of things that convince me further.</p>
