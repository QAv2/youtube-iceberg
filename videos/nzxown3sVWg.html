            <p>you&#x27;ve got to get outside funding for that and for their projects okay when you start to do that when you go out to get these package these packages come down in research already put together the research that is going to be done is already specified you don&#x27;t have any choice about it tells you what you&#x27;re going to do and they&#x27;re done up until of you know the advice comes from the level of the National Academy of Sciences and National Science Foundation and so forth but the advice comes from the very Community that&#x27;s trained in U1 in a classical electrodynamics which basically the definity paper was written in 1865 during the time of the Civil War it was modified actually was curtailed to lesser models two times later one by heavy side in the 1880s just after Maxwell was dead and then further his version of the equation which is what is taught today as Max&#x27;s equations were then further symmetrized by symmetrical region by lent in the 1880s and that&#x27;s what added to Symmetry and throughout all the systems out of symmetry it was an arbitrary decision made by L Rin in the 1860s because it made the equations easier you see otherwise the equations are so nonlinear the variables are not separated you&#x27;ve got to use numerical methods you can&#x27;t separate the variables and solve the equations in most cases so it was horrible when you didn&#x27;t have computers today it&#x27;s not that big a problem they it&#x27;s it&#x27;s problem for an old guy like me but for small for younger guys who go to a good University and get the numerical methods in Mathematica and so forth on computers give him a good computer give him a good program okay numerical methods is no problem he can number crunch the computer will do it he doesn&#x27;t have to sit there and painfully to do it like they had to do it back in the 1880s so they did it for a reason but they threw out the baby with a bath water they threw out exactly a whole class of maxwellian system permitted by that are not in equilibrium with their external environment the external environment being precisely the other two components of the super system the active local vacuum and uh the curve SpaceTime see we didn&#x27;t have the the electron hadn&#x27;t even been discovered then the atom hadn&#x27;t been discovered none of this non- abalan stuff except maybe as an idle curiosity none of that was even born yet we didn&#x27;t have the models what we had was a problem of trying to understand anything at all about electromagnetics and trying to communicate as heav side pointed out with what were then called electricians not electrical engineers and they were about the education of electrician today and uh he said you&#x27;ll never get quaternium across to them that Maxwell wrote his stuff in you got to get it simpler so he chopped it with a broad ax and then when uh Lin came in and forur the Symmetry he chopped it again and it only contained those systems assumed to be in equilibrium or very near equilibrium with their external environment so we have built a whole class of systems and um and procedures and and models throughout physics and throughout chemistry and all these other things depending on electromagnetics based on equilibrium conditions and as long as that system restores its equilibrium very rapidly then the present physics model is quite sufficient and the present uh U1 electrodynamics model is quite sufficient in the present chemistry model is quite sufficient when it doesn&#x27;t recover symmetry almost immediately very quickly so that there&#x27;s not much effects at all from uh disequilibrium if it minimizes all its disequilibrium effects the other models are adequate if it does not minimize disequilibrium effect particularly if it stabilizes the disequilibrium structures and the Dynamics then the other models fall apart they are incapable of describing that kind of condition so we&#x27;ve got to go to the models that can handle it and that&#x27;s the higher symmetry electromagnetics which haven&#x27;t been factored into chemistry very much yet either so we&#x27;re in we&#x27;re caught in a situation where we using 10 and something year old stuff and it&#x27;s been modified and curtailed there have been one hell of a lot of physics discovered since then there&#x27;s been a lot of things discovered in electrodynamics since then so that we could model some of this higher physical phenomena and it hasn&#x27;t been added into the standard uh electrodynamics model and it hasn&#x27;t been added into chemistry that&#x27;s your problem here&#x27;s why I think we may be on the preus of something revolutionary the Natural Evolution of the development of a science is that you have your theories and theories work their way into people with more practical Minds to create the applied science that&#x27;s correct usually a lag time there lag time between certainly between Einstein&#x27;s Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity 1905 and working its way into the creation of nuclear energy for instance by way of example I think what you have right now is a rather unusual situ ation where you have the development of the applied science before the Genesis of the theoretical structure exactly exactly or at least in light of all these other theories that you&#x27;ve that you&#x27;ve been enlightening about um let me just say that it&#x27;s possible that you have the introduction of the applied science before you have the suturing of all of these fragmentary theories which would help to create a kind of cohesive theoretical structure to provide it with uh well greater theoretical legitimacy if you will exactly and what you run into is uh now speak of human beings scientists are after all human beings they have all the same reactions of normal human beings there&#x27;s nothing highly Superior about being a scientist uh that means they form a bell-shaped curve just like any other group of people now yeah there&#x27;s they like the joke that uh 50% of all phys physicists graduated in the bottom half of their class that&#x27;s correct then let&#x27;s talk about what caliber of people they are I know from the bell-shaped curve that they fit a certain percentage of them up on the higher end of the curve that are almost Angelic highly moral highly dedicated to Scientific Method uh you know we&#x27;ll always try to to to take a model for example into account is that modelable by my model or not now the broad band is not going to question the models or talk about models they&#x27;re just going to be applying and doing their job and using physics as it has been developed to the best of their ability they&#x27;re going to be good physicists good scientists and doing good work but they&#x27;re not going to be creating you a new model and they&#x27;re not going to be question in the model you&#x27;re working in now the lower end of those people are just about like Devils they have absolutely no morals they have no dedication to Scientific Method they wouldn&#x27;t even recognize the spelling of it they&#x27;re manipulative they&#x27;ll do anything they have to do to human systems or otherwise to climb the ladder and get as high up as they can in control and they&#x27;re driven by greed power Prestige money all the other good stuff who&#x27;s going to be the big monkey is there driving Motif from the moment they get up in the morning till the time they go to bed at night and then when they dream at night they&#x27;re still in the same Motif okay the problem with those is they skew the curve because of their manipulations and scheming and conniving and all this they do tend to Scamper up and and bi us the bell shaped curve now they don&#x27;t bias it completely thank God because we still got a lot of good scientists and we still got a scientific method and we still got a scientific Community but they do everything they can to turn it into a dogma and a religion now when the money has to start passing through their hands and there&#x27;s more of these up at these higher levels where we get our hands on the money that&#x27;s where the power is in any human system you know control the money you control the system the more they get up high in that in positions in that then they&#x27;re able to influence and control a much vaster part of Science and we would be comfortable with they&#x27;re turning it into dogma and that has progressed far too far along the line so if it&#x27;s the disproportionate voice that&#x27;s correct they have a disproportionate voice the other thing is they attack anything that&#x27;s out of the box that they&#x27;re comparable in and they know they attack it with a viciousness seldom seen in science the recent uh viciousness of the attacks on Cold Fusion is one example uh the attacks on anybody like me for example and I consider myself a poor example I&#x27;m not a super scientist I&#x27;m just a guy that looks at models and looks at what they contain and what they don&#x27;t contain that&#x27;s basically what I do uh but they attack anybody who&#x27;s working out of the box as if he were an utter raving lunatic and as if the science were perfect and it were a religion brought down on the stone tablets with Moses or something that that&#x27;s the problem you&#x27;re up against Dogma not scientific method scientific method is very clear if the experiment is done and done well and properly and if it is repeatable and it repeats the results and those results fall outside the present model the scientific method says You must change the model that&#x27;s not Tom Bearden that scientific method now when you say we&#x27;re going to attack you fiercely and we&#x27;re going to say you know the experiment is wrong I don&#x27;t care how many people replicated it I don&#x27;t care what you did you&#x27;re wrong the experiment is wrong and you&#x27;re a lunatic for even bringing it to my attention get out of my face that is not science that&#x27;s dogma and you&#x27;re dealing with people who want to manipulate it right where it is and very happy in their cushy position you&#x27;re threatening to them you&#x27;re going to change the situation the status quo you don&#x27;t like that at all that&#x27;s your problem interesting</p>
