            <p>we&#x27;re talking about invention secrecy Act of 1951 I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re familiar with it or not no in 1951 this one uh Senator I think wrote this bill John sparksman I think is his name and the where they put these patents in there where they buy it from you because they think it&#x27;s unsafe for the world so let&#x27;s just say you make a patent to create a car that can go 200 miles a gallon of water and you invented that but it&#x27;s going to put a half a trillion dollar industry Oil Business in America out $5 trillion doll industry worldwide listen give us a patent here&#x27;s $20 million keep your mouth shut you can&#x27;t ever sell it to anybody or else you&#x27;re going to jail they come up with this right now they used to buy up the patents for light bulbs that wouldn&#x27;t burn out that so would burn out and they bought those pants CU then this destroys an industry so that that&#x27;s exactly it right so to me that is an element of establishment to protect the establishment so it doesn&#x27;t disrupt</p>
