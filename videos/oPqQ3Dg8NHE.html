            <p>[Music] [Music] hi I&#x27;m Doug Bundy former president of Isis in this short video I want to try to put Maureen Kings lifetime work which has focused on the quest to harness the energy of the fabric of space into the context of Dewey Larsen&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory in which no fabric of space exists I&#x27;m not going to try to explain the observed phenomena of ball lightning Eevee&#x27;s or plasmoid in terms of an rst based theory or model at this point but rather my intent is to show how the legacy system of theory is wholly unsuitable to use as a basis for investigating these phenomena and knowing fence is intended more-- by this but it&#x27;s what we you know it&#x27;s what we stand for it that&#x27;s the object of our organization is to establish the fact that Larsen&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory is a revolution a genuine revolution in physics the bottom line is found in the unrecognized revolution in our understanding of the nature of space and time which Larsson works which his work reveals so clearly the fact is the only known relationship of space the time is motion and even though one can think about space-time as Einstein did and do things with it to a certain extent in the end it won&#x27;t work as the LSTs great theoretical crisis now shows the ultimate reason as Einstein knew only too well is the fundamental incompatibility of continuous and discrete magnitudes though it&#x27;s not widely known Einstein actually would have preferred a discrete based or algebraic physics but he was unable to find a way to get such a thing get to such a thing he was can inst as today&#x27;s physicists are - now after pursuing unification as diligently as he did even though he was mocked for doing so at the time they&#x27;re convinced that the space continuum is doomed as the famous string theorist Edward Witten puts it in fact according to the well-known theoretical physics physicist our Connie Hamid the idea that the space continuum might not be fundamental is pretty well accepted in the LST community but in his day Einstein suffered alone plagued as he put it with his thoughts that the assumption of a space and time continuum was probably the wrong approach given the physical phenomena are quantized nevertheless all the while he is celebrated as the champion who revolutionized continuum physics John Stachel of the University of Boston Center for Einstein studies who first discovered this other side of Einstein explains quote if one looks at Einsteins work carefully including his published writings but particularly his correspondence and memory of conversations with him one finds strong evidence for the existence of another Einstein one who questioned the fundamental significance of the continuum his skepticism seems to have deepened over the years resulting late in his life in a profound pessimism about the field theoretical program even as he continued to pursue it close quote pursue it the drawback is essentially that one needs to have a continuum in order to have a discontinuing Einstein put it like this the problem seems to me to be how one can formulate statements about a discontinued &#x27;m without calling upon a continuum as an aid the latter should be banned from the theory as a supplementary construction not justified by the essence of the problem a construction which corresponds to nothing real but we still lack the mathematical structure and fortunately how much have I already plagued myself and excuse me how much have I already plagued myself in this way close quote well long after Einstein the LST community found out the hard way just what he meant when they sought to unify their quantum physics or quantum field theory with Einsteins physics of the continuum in fact they have a term for it is referred to by them as the vacuum catastrophe let&#x27;s let them explain it in this PBS video clip the most successful theory in all of physics is arguably quantum field theory it&#x27;s made the most precise predictions in all of science but it&#x27;s also made the worst there&#x27;s a massive disagreement between the theoretical and the measured values of the energy of the vacuum we call this theoretical fail the vacuum catastrophe the quantum vacuum is a seething ocean of activity virtual particles appear and vanish from nowhere in seeming violation of our intuitions about the conservation of mass and energy we saw in our recent episode that we can thank the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for this bizarre behavior it tells us that there&#x27;s a quantum fuzziness and the amount of energy contained at every point in space a non-zero zero-point energy in the quantum fields that can briefly manifest as particles this suggests that space itself contains energy but how much energy quantum field theory predicts that the energy of the vacuum should be up to a hundred and twenty orders of magnitude greater than the measured value it&#x27;s one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics the President or the presenter in this clip goes on to help viewers grasp just how mammoth this theoretical fail quote-unquote is it&#x27;s unimaginably huge and the reason is just as Einstein wrote the idea of the fabric of space as we refer to it today is nothing but a supplementary construction quote unquote that is unreal and should quote unquote be banned from the theory the trouble is of course Einstein could never figure out how to do that and neither has anyone else except Dewey B Larsen consequently the LSD community has swept this unfortunate in fact under the rug as Hamid admits don&#x27;t imagine you got fifty zeros and you&#x27;re still adding so how dance is that let me give you an example yeah yeah I&#x27;m getting there if you take a sending me a cube of space and you were to take all the stars in the universe we see with the largest telescope billions of stars right this billions of stars four galaxies that&#x27;s billions of galaxies most stars are much larger than our Sun some of them are larger than our solar system and we grab those like quasars and stuff and we grab all that stuff we squashed it all into a centimeter cube of space with the huge trash compactor or something imagine our dance that would be how energetic that would be right well you would still be off by some thirty nine orders of magnitude right because you would have a cube of a density of ten to the 55th grams per centimeter cube so you&#x27;d be off by 39 you still need to add 39 zeroes to get the dissing density of the vacuum which is formally infinite right do you think that the physicists that discovered this stopped and said hey maybe we need to consider this in our physics you know they looked at that number and snow my god it&#x27;s actually called the vacuum catastrophe inside huh what do we do just ignore it brah that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re studying in Hawaii you know if you&#x27;re here you&#x27;d say ignore it might little translation for you guys and you know all this energy just got pushed to the sign and said put under the carpet and say hey you know this is too overwhelming this property has no significant physical meaning you just found the most massive amount of energy ever and you&#x27;re saying has no physical meaning most likely is the source of all physical meaning brah if you&#x27;re a lion the words of Einstein should actually be ringing in the ears of the alst community physicists they should be hearing ban the continuum from the theory ban to continuum from the theory but of course they can hardly do that at this point the key to solving this awful dilemma however the key offered by Larson is actually hidden in plain sight but the LSD community physicists can&#x27;t see it because it requires independent investigators with no investment in a career of theoretical physicist or physics to invest the time and energy necessary in order to seriously consider such a radically new paradigm in this new paradigm vector motion or the one dimensional motion of objects changing relative positions in space is not the only motion of nature besides this one dimensional change of motion which is the sole basis for modern physical laws and theory there also exists month multiple multi-dimensional change of interval motion and multi-dimensional change of scale motion to consider and without recognizing this fact the LSD community is left to chase down rabbit holes in the lab earnest of the continuum nevertheless while the solution can only be sketched at this point all indications are that the mathematical structure which Einstein pine for that would have enabled him to define a distance this continuum without the aid of a continuum is now at hand although to be sure he outlined major conceptual obstacles with both concepts for instance he wrote the following on the discontinued yet icy difficulties of principle here - he wrote the electrons his points would be the ultimate entities in such a system of building blocks are there indeed such building blocks why are they all of equal magnitude is it satisfactory to say god and his wisdom made them all equally big each like every other because he wanted it that way if it pleased him he could also have created them different with the continuum viewpoint one is actually better off in this respect because one doesn&#x27;t have to prescribe elementary building blocks from the beginning further the old question of the vacuum where they&#x27;re talking about michelson-morley experimented that was very big then there&#x27;s no ether but he goes on to say these considerations must pale besides the overwhelming beside the overwhelming fact that the continuum is more ample than the things to be described well in this last sentence he perfectly unquote there so in this last sentence he perfectly articulates his understanding of the vacuum catastrophe of quantum field theory which is yet was yet to be fully appreciated in his day but the answer to his concern for how to prescribe elementary building blocks from the beginning which caused him to hesitate in favor of it in spite of the overwhelming fact that the continuum is obviously too ample is now at hand Larsen&#x27;s rst has made it straightforward so as usual Einstein was right on when he observed quote one doesn&#x27;t have the right today to maintain that the foundation of physics must consist of a field theory in the sense of Maxwell the other possibility leads in my opinion to a renunciation of the space-time continuum and to a purely algebraic physics so that&#x27;s close quote so where does that leave us as members of Isis well we still have ZPE to consider as a source of energy to be tapped it&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t exist at every point in the vacuum the so called fabric of space because there is no such fabric instead our redefined concept of space is simply shown to be an aspect of an unrecognized type of motion scalar motion we start with it and find that by simple principles unit building blocks of what we could call ZPE emerge with which to build matter with no background needed just how we get from these units of ZPE as elementary building blocks of matter from the ZPE to quarks and to leptons and to baryons and onto atoms in the wheel of motion and from there to the molecules of chemistry and from there to ball lightning Eevee&#x27;s and plasmoid x&#x27; is a work in progress but we&#x27;ve had enough success to give us great confidence that the anomalous energy that we see and that Mori will be explaining consists in the motions combinations of motions and the relations between them that are now under development the point is we are not stuck by the vacuum catastrophe as Steven Weinberg puts it in his book dreams of a final theory a final theory is no longer just a dream as we awaken to the reality that physical objects and physical phenomena consist of nothing but motion existing in three dimensions with two reciprocal aspects space and time we now know that as Arsen put it all we observe is either a motion a combination of motions or relations between them but this much understood then as we listen to the remarkable discoveries of modern day Michael Faraday&#x27;s like Ken&#x27;s shoulders and Walter Jenkins and all the others who Maury King has studied over these many years we can hope that a modern-day James Maxwell will come along to integrate it all together with a new mathematical insight that will revolutionize the world once again in the meantime however we should understand and be sure that the needed paradigm shift is not a shift from the classical physics of Maxwell&#x27;s continuous field equations to the quantum physics of Dirac&#x27;s discrete field equations but from the physics of the LSTs impossible concept of space-time to the physics of the RS T&#x27;s new concept of expanding space over its inverse expanding time thank you</p>
