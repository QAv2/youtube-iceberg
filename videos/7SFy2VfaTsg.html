            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>They rejected Earth without even reading the file. That&#x27;s the part that gets me. Not the arrogance of it, though there was plenty of that. Not the dismissal, not the condescension in the form letter, not even the checkbox they ticked that read. Simply bias fear manageable.</p>
<p>No. What gets me is that they sent a delegation to prove they were right. They wanted witnesses. They wanted documentation. They wanted the record to show officially that Soul 3 was nothing.</p>
<p>A temperate little rock with soft gravity and a tame little food chain and absolutely no business applying to the Deathworld Alliance. They got documentation all right. They got 30 days of it. And when senior auditor VHI filed his final report, all 460 annotated pages of it, he included a personal note at the end. It read, &quot;We came to prove Earth was harmless.&quot; We were wrong.</p>
<p>The letter arrived at the Soul 3 Observation Bureau on a Tuesday. It was not the first rejection. The Alliance had been turning down Earth&#x27;s application for 11 years, each time with a different flavor of bureaucratic dismissal. The first rejection cited insufficient megapona threat density. The second noted that Earth&#x27;s apex predators were nonsapient and therefore categorically unqualified as existential threats.</p>
<p>The third, and this one was a personal favorite among the bureau staff who had taped it to the breakroom wall, described Earth&#x27;s weather systems as energetic but navigable. Navigable. They called a category 5 hurricane navigable. The 11th rejection was different only in that it contained an addendum. Someone in the Alliance&#x27;s classification bureau, no one ever found out who, had apparently lost a bet or an argument or possibly their mind because buried in the standard boilerplate was a single extra paragraph.</p>
<p>In the interest of closing this matter conclusively and without further petitions, the bureau will dispatch a grade three evaluation delegation to soul 3. If the planet fails to meet category 3 minimums in three or more assessment categories, this application will be permanently closed. The bureau staff read this three times. Then they called Dr. Ana Corvath, their best field liaison, and told her to pack for a month.</p>
<p>What should I prepare? She asked. Nothing, said bureau director Oay, who was smiling for the first time in 11 years. Just take them outside. Senior auditor Vasie arrived expecting to be boarded. This is documented.</p>
<p>He said it out loud to his delegation as the shuttle broke atmosphere over the North American continent. He had done 43 planetary evaluations. He had walked the crystallin killing fields of Sherith Prime. He had cataloged the apex predators of more death.</p>
