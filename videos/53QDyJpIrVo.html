            <p>Quantum shift with the observer effect | shift reality | quantum manifestation | manifesting | manifestation what if the world around you isn&#x27;t real  in the way that you think it is what if   what you see around you the people the  circumstances the results isn&#x27;t reality   at all but a custom projection rendered  by your own mind because that&#x27;s exactly   what&#x27;s happening you don&#x27;t actually see reality  you translate it your beliefs your focus your   identity they are the software and reality </p>
<p>is just the output and here&#x27;s where it gets   interesting while neuroscience explains how  we do this how the brain converts frequencies   and signals into form spirituality explains  why it matters it tells us that we&#x27;re not   the body interpreting the signals we are the  consciousness observing the interpretation the   projector the chooser the creator this means that  what you see in the world is not the full truth   it&#x27;s simply only one version of infinite </p>
<p>possibilities that are available and in this   video you&#x27;re going to learn why you only see and  experience what your brain is trained to recognize   the truth behind perception and consciousness  and how to train your mind so it bends reality   automatically without effort and without waiting  because once you understand how reality truly   works and how it&#x27;s formed in the mind you  can stop chasing it and start directing it most people assume that they&#x27;re walking around </p>
<p>taking in a complete accurate picture of reality   but the truth is you&#x27;re only seeing a tiny  fraction of what&#x27;s actually available the   brain receives over 11 million bits of information  per second through your senses but your conscious   mind can only process about 40 of those bits  so what happens to the rest your brain filters   it out it deletes what it thinks isn&#x27;t relevant  it distorts things that don&#x27;t match your current   belief systems and it generalizes patterns that </p>
<p>feel familiar even if they&#x27;re not true there&#x27;s a   gatekeeper between the subconscious mind and the  conscious mind known as the reticular activating   system and it basically decides what gets your  attention based on one thing what it believes   is important and how does it know what&#x27;s important  based on what you&#x27;ve repeated what you&#x27;ve believed   what you&#x27;ve emotionally rehearsed over time  so if you believe life is hard you&#x27;ll see   more difficulty if you believe people can&#x27;t </p>
<p>be trusted you&#x27;ll notice the betrayals if you   believe you&#x27;re unlucky or unseen or stuck your  reticular activating system will literally filter   out evidence that could contradict that and why  does it do this because your brain is loyal to   your belief systems always so it&#x27;s not showing  you all the truths available it&#x27;s showing you   the truth of what it&#x27;s been trained to find and  that training comes from your beliefs your focus   and your emotional history and that&#x27;s how you </p>
<p>experience your reality as a manifested version   of your mind but you are not your brain or the  inner workings of that you are the consciousness   directing it you are the observer behind the lens  the chooser behind the filter the awareness with   the ability to reprogram what gets through  the gate in other words you can train it to   see a new truth a new reality and this is  where quantum physics and spiritual truth   meet in quantum terms reality exists as waveform </p>
<p>potential pure possibility until it&#x27;s observed   and when observation is combined with intention  and emotion that potential collapses into form   into the version of reality that you recognize  as your life so while the brain acts like   a translator consciousness is the selector it  picks the frequency it determines what becomes   real and the more you consciously direct what you  focus on what you expect and what you emotionally   repeat the more you begin shifting the entire </p>
<p>lens through which reality is formed and from   this vantage point you&#x27;re no longer reacting to  what is you&#x27;re consciously creating what&#x27;s next   because reality is not fixed it&#x27;s filtered and you  are the one deciding what gets through so let&#x27;s   take it one layer deeper quantum physics tells  us that everything exists as potential first not   just one outcome and not just one version of you  but infinite timelines all existing in a wavelike   unformed state until you focus and the moment you </p>
<p>place your attention on something with consistency   and emotion you collapse that wave into a particle  into form you pull that timeline into your   field this means you are not living in a fixed  reality you are living inside of a self-curated   illusion that updates every time you shift your  focus every thought you revisit every story you   rehearse every assumption you energize with your  feelings that becomes the reality and the timeline   that you experience so when people say stay on </p>
<p>your timeline what they&#x27;re really saying is stay   loyal to your vision stay emotionally committed  to the outcome that you&#x27;ve chosen because if you   shift your focus you shift your reality and  the more stabilized your focus becomes the   more momentum that timeline gathers it becomes  your default your norm your physical experience now if you&#x27;ve watched my videos on the God  state you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m about to say the   God state is the level of consciousness where </p>
<p>you learn to stop chasing what&#x27;s wanted and start   commanding it with certainty as your experience  of reality you don&#x27;t just focus on the outcome   you become the one who knows it&#x27;s already done  and allow the unseen energies of the universe   to work in your favor it&#x27;s what&#x27;s referred to  as identity level creation the kind of state   where timelines align to you because you are no  longer signaling doubt delay or separation if you   want to go deeper into that level of creation </p>
<p>be sure to watch my video about it after this   one there&#x27;s a card popping up on the screen  now that will help you understand this better now that you understand how focus selects  timelines let&#x27;s talk about how to stabilize   it because this is where many people often  lose their connection to the new reality   they visualize a few times they set the intention  they even feel aligned for a day or two but then   life throws something off they get distracted </p>
<p>by what they don&#x27;t want they start reacting to   what&#x27;s still playing out from their past energy  and then without realizing it they reinforce the   timeline that they&#x27;ve already been on rather than  shifting to a new one so here&#x27;s how you shift into   the timeline that you&#x27;re choosing and stay locked  into it number one you must decide with certainty   this seems subtle but it&#x27;s actually very powerful  i hear from people all of the time how they hoped   or wished their new reality would show up but </p>
<p>the ones who shift timelines fast decide with   certainty that it&#x27;s already done they claim it  and walk forward as if life is now responding   to that claim this act of internal certainty  of energetic closure on the old and validation   of the new is the beginning of real momentum  number two keep acting like it&#x27;s already real   your body your tone of voice your posture  your thoughts should reflect the version of   you who&#x27;s already living in the outcome you must </p>
<p>become someone new to experience something new   when you do this you&#x27;re telling your subconscious  mind and your nervous system &quot;This is who I am now   this is the reality that we&#x27;re loyal to i live it  as my experience.&quot; And the subconscious mind which   is deeply habit- based will begin to conform it  will update the signals it sends to the quantum   field and the world around you will begin to  reflect that it will open your perceptual field   to all of the new possible ways that this reality </p>
<p>can and will become manifest for you number three   is to stop rehearsing the old timeline you must  be ruthless with this don&#x27;t talk about how hard   it&#x27;s been don&#x27;t repeat stories of being stuck  overlooked or unsupported those are instructions   to your perceptual system to find more of the same  instead begin to rehearse the new timeline and   the new story until it becomes natural in other  words tell better feeling stories speak about how   wonderful your life is tell others how amazingly </p>
<p>well things are going for you and be delusional   about it if your current circumstances don&#x27;t match  yet just remind yourself that&#x27;s simply the old   illusion it has nothing to do with who I am  now when you stay steady in this identity when   you refuse to collapse back into old emotional  habits you stabilize your new signal and your   new timeline and once the signal is stabilized  the quantum field must respond it&#x27;s universal   law and number four is to train your perception </p>
<p>to expect evidence once you&#x27;ve stopped feeling the   old timeline your job isn&#x27;t to wait for signs  or look for proof but to anticipate alignment   to expect it your brain&#x27;s reticular activating  system filters what you notice based on what   it thinks matters to you so when you begin to  expect evidence of your new timeline it will   start highlighting the matching people signs  synchronicities gut feelings and shifts to do   this effectively begin to take your everyday </p>
<p>experiences and label them as evidence even   something small like an unexpected compliment or a  moment of ease can be your new evidence if you&#x27;re   looking through the lens of alignment so tell  yourself &quot;Here is my evidence that my new timeline   is forming around me.&quot; Instead of thinking &quot;Is it  working yet?&quot; or &quot;Where&#x27;s the proof?&quot; You&#x27;ll start   thinking &quot;Of course it&#x27;s working i&#x27;m on the path  already because you are.&quot; And the more you do this   the more you will train your brain to believe </p>
<p>you&#x27;re on that path and to seek out and create   more instances of everything lining up for you in  other words your perception will begin confirming   it automatically just remember that you don&#x27;t  need to keep fixing what you&#x27;ve already chosen   to change you&#x27;re no longer at the mercy of what  shows up you are the signal and reality is the   echo and the echo always returns what the signal  demands so let the outer world recalibrate to you   rather than calibrating to it because that&#x27;s </p>
