            <p>[Music] are invisible aliens Among Us well that is exactly what this video from Northrop Grumman is proposing get in here this is Jack with Cosmic Road I talk about UFOs in the Paranormal please hit like Please Subscribe share on social media and let me know what you think in the comments below okay I came across this really great Twitter thread from the one and it&#x27;s a really really intriguing okay so yeah someone on Reddit posted this find and uh back in 2021 the official Northrop Grumman Facebook page posted a seconds long video clip with no sound alluding to E.T walking among us but in a shadow biome what and the reason why this is significant if you don&#x27;t know who Northrop Grumman is Northrop Grumman Corporation is an American multinational Aerospace and defense technology company with 95 000 employees in an annual revenue in excess of 30 billion it is one of the world&#x27;s largest weapons manufacturers in military technology providers so when we talk about contractors that are working on UFO related material probably reverse engineering this stuff or farming this technology out you know definitely one of the leading contenders for some of that technology so what exactly did they share well let&#x27;s watch a little invisible alien guy walking through there and that&#x27;s all there is to it that&#x27;s all there is to it and hinting at uh I suppose the shadow biome as some were calling it I am not an expert on the shadow biome I&#x27;ve read a little bit about it I&#x27;ve watched a little a little bit about it but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m really qualified to talk about it so let&#x27;s go to somebody who is let&#x27;s hear what Gary Nolan has to say you know when I uh interviewed Oak Shannon the the former special projects manager for Los Alamos um and a name that comes up a few times in the Admiral Wilson documents or the Eric Davis notes Oak said to me that the conclusion they came to at the labs was that this phenomenon is interdimensional in nature so what do you think Gary do you agree with Oak Shannon um well I don&#x27;t have any direct experiences to whether or not they are interdimensional or not but they at the very least they seem to be able to control the ability to step in and out of apparent reality so they they might not come from elsewhere they might be from here but they&#x27;ve learned how to move in ways that could only be described as interdimensional um you know I mean I mean for instance let&#x27;s let let&#x27;s explore something that&#x27;s been puzzling me for some time now um so many of the claimed um names that people have interacted with and trying to find whatever the right word is without original um looks humanoid in one way or another two eggs two arms not always the same number of fingers or whatever but a very similar body plan to us right overall um I don&#x27;t get it as a geneticist I don&#x27;t get it so uh it just it becomes very difficult for me to explain why this is the only form in which intelligence can inhabit even if it&#x27;s a fairly varied form so that tells me one of two things either these things are made to look enough like us so that they&#x27;re let&#x27;s say avatars of some kind uh through which something else less let&#x27;s say understandable is interfacing with us uh that&#x27;s one option I don&#x27;t know that I have to break in here to say that that is absolutely true that these beings can and do uh have the ability to based on my research and I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of it uh I don&#x27;t want to say it&#x27;s more than Gary here of course but uh based on many experience or accounts the beings can appear to be human when they are not sometimes experience for experiencers will say hey is that your true form I want to see your true form and they will show them their true form and it will be something completely different it&#x27;ll be you know a mantis being or what have you and so they do absolutely have the ability to mimic human uh you know shape and that is true as well for near-death experiencers people who have died and been to the other side and come back well sometimes when they&#x27;re they&#x27;re on the other side they will encounter beings and as every now and then you&#x27;ll get an experience where they will encounter it being that looks human but that is simply to put them at ease and once they understand that they will ask to see their true shape or or what have you and they will be told or given the information that that is not their true shape but they were given that to placate the individual going through this experience and that was actually appreciated by the individual okay back Erie it&#x27;s true I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s one option um or two it they come from some adjacent reality which is sufficiently let&#x27;s say similar to us that they you know at some point in the past Evolution broke off a different way and still create and so they kind of look like us but they are not and that in so saying they&#x27;re able to more easily jump to us because in whatever the metaverse is it&#x27;s closer I don&#x27;t know or maybe they don&#x27;t want to go over and talk to the octopoints because they have nothing in common with the octopoints or the you know I use the example of we&#x27;re more likely to be able to breed with a rutabaga vanity would with some of the things that was supposed to be seen that the genetics just don&#x27;t operate that way and so but that&#x27;s with my understanding with genetics and so maybe I&#x27;m just wrong I you know I I can&#x27;t be too absolute about what my definitions of the possible are if I&#x27;m going to be willing to uh if I&#x27;m going to be able to be open-minded about what the possibility is um and so I don&#x27;t understand that and so the only I mean an easy out is Maybe interdimensional but it&#x27;s also a fake just like you know waving the wand of quantum you know nonsense around every time we want to explain something it has to do with a Quantum version of you know of uh Quantum empiricism or it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just we&#x27;re using words in in we&#x27;re using words that almost mean nothing as if it means something so we just have to be very careful about it well there you go Gary Nolan&#x27;s two ideas that they look like us but they&#x27;re actually those when they look like us they&#x27;re actually avatars or else they evolved um you know alongside us but then broke off into their own shadow biome which I still don&#x27;t quite understand but I guess I get the basic idea that they are here and not here at the same time possibly phase shifted slightly out of our reality I think that is the idea uh you know maybe they exist on a slightly different vibrational level than we do perhaps that would explain it or are we talking about you know a different dimension or is that possibly with you know different dimension means uh is it something like you know if if reality is the visual spectrum and or the reality is is the light all the light spectrum and we exist in the visual Spectrum but there&#x27;s also ultraviolet and infrared and the things that exist far outside of our visual spectrum that are still occupy our reality uh is that kind of the idea of the Shadow biome let me know your thoughts in the comments below if I&#x27;m getting close to this however I think all of those things are on the table and are very likely true the dimensional aspect of this definitely seems to be present according to many experiencers people like the quantum uh computer Guru deep Prasad and Whitley strieber they have said that when they have been taken they are taken to a place outside of our reality they say it&#x27;s a deeper level of reality those are deep facades own words a deeper level of reality and I think that Whitley strieber said essentially the same thing and that is echoed amongst many experiencers there&#x27;s this idea of going outside of our reality to somewhere else and I think the best way to look at this the best Insight I can give is to look at near-death experiences because that is what they describe as well is they are taken outside of this reality even outside of time time exists all at once to people going through these experiences somehow it doesn&#x27;t drive them insane it&#x27;s actually normal and natural and they feel great up there uh typically there are a few negative near-death experiences to be sure the vast bulk of them seem to be positive thank goodness but that is a possible insight into the sort of reality we&#x27;re dealing with is there is the reality that we inhabit this 3D physical reality that has a linear time structure and there is something outside of that maybe the bulk of the Uber reality exists outside of our tiny little bubble reality and we as Souls come into this reality for some purpose or Reason at least that is the idea you get if you study near-death experiences for any length of time and in many of these experiences they actually encounter aliens and non-humans that is very common in near-death experiences sometimes they will go and live on a different planet as a different species for a while and they will be able to come back and tell people all about these water worlds or whatever where they existed as a mermaid or a dolphin-like being or something of that order so you know that kind of gives us a little peephole into the idea of dimensions and experiencing different dimensions as does out of body experiences I love to study out of body experiences just as I love to study near-death experiences and I have actually been trying to provoke an out-of-body experience in my own half-assed way I&#x27;m you know I wish I was more dedicated it seems to take a lot of work to have an out-of-body experience you have to interrupt your sleep uh if you do it in the technique that I&#x27;m thinking about for a month or two before you might maybe have an out-of-body experience so I haven&#x27;t quite committed to that so I&#x27;ve just been trying to do it through meditation and so on but I would love to experience other dimensions and I would you know likewise love to take a journey through this Shadow biome which may be slightly face shifted out of of our reality but exists here on Earth or possibly in some parallel earth that is you know connected to our Earth and these beings can kind of come and go potentially that&#x27;s kind of how I think of Bigfoot is uh like Gary was saying something that evolved alongside us but branched off into a different a different path a different evolutionary path that&#x27;s how I view Bigfoot as you know we evolved in a technological path what if Bigfoot evolved in a spiritual or Consciousness path and learn to you know it&#x27;s Consciousness became so elevated it could phase in and out of reality something like that I think may or may not be the case with Bigfoot I have no idea let me know your thoughts on Bigfoot below but I did want to talk about this Shadow by biome especially since it was brought to my attention then Northrop Grumman um you know a huge a huge contractor a very important one to the U.S is and or was two years two or three years ago uh promoting this idea of invisible aliens walking amongst us what does Northrop Grumman know that the rest of us don&#x27;t let me know your thoughts in the comments below and if you&#x27;ve enjoyed this video please give it a big thumbs up I sure would appreciate it
