            <p>This is a crash course on scalar physics, a science still in its infancy that opens the door to exotic applications like antigravity, free energy, time travel, invisibility, and faster than light communication. In this video I&#x27;ll introduce you to force fields, potential fields, and the scalar superpotential that unites magnetism, electricity, and gravity.</p>
<p>Now, scalar physics has probably already been perfected in secret among black projects, and it seems to form the basis of alien technology. But we the public have been kept in the dark about it for both noble and ignoble reasons. For starters, our oil-based economy would probably</p>
<p>collapse and scalar weaponry is potentially more dangerous than even nuclear weapons. And secondly, the elite powers do enjoy their asymmetric advantage over the rest of humanity. So scalar physics has been suppressed from mainstream science and engineering.</p>
<p>That said, if you open a college physics textbook, you will find some of the primitive foundations of scalar physics among the various equations -- but the rest that really counts is conveniently left out. And that suppression has been happening for almost 150 years now.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m making this video, to introduce you to scalar physics, a science that probably won&#x27;t be common knowledge for another century. But you can get a glimpse of it right now, by watching this video. So let&#x27;s dive in.</p>
<p>Alright, so from everyday life you&#x27;re already familiar with magnetism, electricity, and gravity. Magnetism is what makes magnets stick to your refrigerator. Electricity in its static form makes your</p>
<p>clothes cling together on a dry day. And gravity is what holds you to the ground and keeps planets orbiting the Sun. In physics, these are known as force fields. They are invisible fields of influence that</p>
<p>exert forces on their corresponding substances. The magnetic field exerts force on a magnetic substance like iron, and thereby attracts it. The electric field exerts force on something that is, or can be, electrically charged, like an electron or proton.</p>
<p>And the gravitational field exerts force on matter according to its mass. Now, on the surface, it seems these three fields are totally different and separate from each other. But what if they&#x27;re not really separate? We&#x27;ve already known since the 1800s that electric</p>
<p>and magnetic fields are two sides of the same coin called electromagnetism, but how gravity  ties into that has eluded science to this day. So what if the magnetic, electric, and gravitational fields are just different expressions of a common underlying field? What if they arise from different kinds of distortions in that field? That&#x27;s what scalar physics is about.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about understanding this single fundamental field and how exactly it gives rise to the three force fields. Because with that understanding, you can work out how to manipulate them. For instance, to distort gravity you might</p>
<p>use nonlinear electric fields or rotating magnetic fields. And because gravity involves a distortion of space and time, by controlling gravity, you can control space and time. That&#x27;s where the really exotic applications come in, like time travel and opening portals to other dimensions.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s a general overview of what scalar physics IS. Now let&#x27;s go a bit deeper into the details of how that all works. To do that, I&#x27;m going to explain some common</p>
<p>terms and concepts used in mainstream physics because scalar physics is just the logical extension of that, so it&#x27;s important to understand these terms. So the reason we call it SCALAR physics is because the fundamental field that gives rise the the three force fields is technically a type of scalar field.</p>
<p>Now, there&#x27;s nothing exotic about the term &quot;scalar,&quot; it&#x27;s just math speak meaning &quot;a single number&quot; or &quot;a single value.&quot; The number 10 is a scalar. Distance is a scalar. Weight is a scalar. Temperature is a scalar.</p>
<p>Altitude is a scalar. A scalar is just a number describing some particular measured value. A scalar FIELD, on the other hand, is one where each point in that field has one number associated with it, usually to denote the</p>
<p>strength of the field at that point. For example, the distribution of temperature in a room could be thought of as a scalar field. At each location, at any given moment, there&#x27;s one temperature associated with that spot.</p>
<p>Same with air pressure, population density, or altitude. These are all scalar values, which, when mapped over space and time, makes up a scalar field. What distinguishes one scalar field from another,</p>
<p>then, comes down to what exactly is being measured In scalar physics, the scalar field  is measured in units of magnetic flux, or quantum phase, or action, depending on how you want to interpet it. But that&#x27;s getting ahead of ourselves, so let&#x27;s continue.</p>
<p>Besides scalar, another important and related term is &quot;vector.&quot; A vector is like a scalar except instead of being just a single number indicating field strength, it has additional numbers describing the direction that the field is pointing towards. So a vector field is one where each point</p>
<p>in the field has both a field strength and a direction associated with it. Common example would be a weather map showing wind speed. One spot shows 10 miles per hour north-north-east, another 5 miles per hour south east.</p>
<p>These measurements are vectors, and the entire map makes up a vector field for wind. The electric, magnetic, and gravitational force fields are vector fields too. They exert a certain magnitude of force in</p>
<p>a certain direction upon a given particle in that field. Now, even mainstream physics recognizes that force fields are not primary. It teaches that the three force fields we know are the result of distortions in more fundamental fields called potentials.</p>
<p>There are three main potential fields  that are used in physics. 1. The electric scalar potential (more commonly known as Voltage) 2.</p>
<p>The magnetic vector potential (which is like a kind of electromagnetic momentum flow) And 3. the gravitational scalar potential (which in Einstein’s theory of Relativity determines the rate of time). So these are the 3 potential fields that give rise to the</p>
<p>electric, magnetic, and gravitational force fields. Let’s take a closer look at how that happens. Magnetism comes from circulation in the magnetic vector potential. So when the magnetic vector potential circulates</p>
<p>like a vortex or helix, you get a magnetic line of force along the axis of that circulation. It&#x27;s analogous to wind in a tornado swirling around the tornado&#x27;s vertical axis. We call that circulation curl, and in math and physics say that the magnetic field equals the curl of the magnetic vector potential.</p>
<p>The electric field, on the other hand, comes from a gradient in the underlying electric scalar potential. Gradient means that the value of the electric scalar potential varies over some distance. The electric force field vector points along</p>
<p>that gradient. And similarly, the gravitational field arises from a gradient in the underlying gravitational potential. On Earth, the gravitational potential varies linearly with height above ground, or to be more accurate, the radial distance from the</p>
<p>center of the planet. So we experience a vertical gradient in the gravitational potential, each height having a slightly different potential, and that produces the gravitational force that we feel. So potentials are more fundamental than force</p>
<p>fields and give rise to them when they are distorted in certain ways like having curls or gradients in them. But what if these three potentials are NOT fundamental either? What if they&#x27;re expressions of an even deeper underlying field? Well, if you follow the math, you&#x27;ll find that there IS a deeper field, but it has no official name.</p>
<p>It shows up in textbook discussions on so-called gauge transformations, where it’s generically referred to as “some scalar function.&quot; But sadly, it&#x27;s glossed over without further discussion. So let&#x27;s work with it and give this deeper field a proper name.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s call it the scalar superpotential. Scalar because it has one numerical value for each point in that field (a value measured in Webers) and &quot;superpotential&quot; because it’s even more primary than the electric, magnetic, and gravitational potentials. We can denote the superpotential by the Greek</p>
<p>symbol Chi, which looks like a letter X. So how do the three potentials relate to this one superpotential? If we can figure that out, we’ll have an idea of how electricity, magnetism, and gravity all arise from that single unified field. Let’s start with the electric scalar and</p>
<p>magnetic vector potentials. 1. When the scalar superpotential (X) changes over time, you get the electric scalar potential. 2.</p>
<p>When the scalar superpotential (X) changes over space, you get the magnetic vector potential. Pretty simple, right? This means that the electric force field arises when the superpotential varies over both time and space. And the magnetic force field arises when the</p>
<p>superpotential varies over space in such a way that this variation curls to form a helix. This is all textbook physics so far and you can do the math and show it’s legit. What about gravity, though? See, that&#x27;s where scalar physics goes one step beyond mainstream physics.</p>
<p>It does so by proposing a very special postulate, the key to it all, which is that the gravitational potential is a product of the other two potentials. The postulate says that the  gravitational potential arises when there is a divergence in the magnetic vector potential, and when the electric scalar potential changes</p>
<p>with time in a curl-free way. Let&#x27;s break those down. Normally, the magnetic vector potential curls into a magnetic force field. But when it doesn&#x27;t curl, and instead diverges</p>
<p>or converges, that&#x27;s what scalar physics says produces a gravitational potential. Divergence of the magnetic vector potential is key. Divergence is a math term meaning there&#x27;s expansion or compression in the field.</p>
<p>In other words, the field vectors point  away from or towards a common center. That&#x27;s opposite of curl, which involves the field circulating around something rather than converging or diverging from it. As for the electric scalar potential, that can</p>
<p>also create a gravitational potential under certain conditions. Normally, as explained the electric scalar potential has a gradient that forms and electric force field. And if this electric field changes over time, then according to Maxwell&#x27;s Equations, you get a curling magnetic vector potential that</p>
<p>produces a magnetic field. The electric and magnetic fields in that case fluctuate and propagate together as an electromagnetic wave, whether as light, microwaves, radio waves or x-rays. That&#x27;s what normally happens.</p>
<p>But what if the curl of the magnetic vector potential is suppressed or cancelled out? What if you set things up so that the magnetic vector potential does NOT produce a magnetic field? Simple example of that is a spherical capacitor with an oscillating electric field. Then, what you get instead is a changing gravitational</p>
<p>potential. So instead of a transverse electromagnetic wave, you would get what&#x27;s called a longitudinal electrogravitational wave. Transverse means the field wiggles side to side as it travels,  which is what electromagnetism normally does.</p>
<p>Longitudinal means it compresses and expands in the direction of travel, which is what these artificial gravity waves do. So that&#x27;s one application of scalar physics, using a changing electric field to produce a gravitational wave. For posterity let&#x27;s put everything together on one screen</p>
<p>and show how the magnetic, electric, and gravitational force fields all come from a single underlying scalar superpotential: 1. The magnetic field = helical curling of the gradient of the scalar superpotential. 2.</p>
<p>The electric field = gradient of a time-varying scalar superpotential. 3a. The gravitational field = gradient in the divergence of the gradient of the scalar superpotential.</p>
<p>3b. Gravitational field = gradient in a time-varying scalar superpotential that varies over time. Now, is this all just theory? Or is it supported by real world data? Well, if you dig into the subject of suppressed inventions and anomalous phenomena, and if you ask yourself whether these things might</p>
<p>involve diverging vector potentials or time-varying curl-free electric potentials, you’ll find that not only are they present, but they’re the very key to the operation of these technologies or phenomena. I&#x27;m talking about things like ball lightning and exotic vacuum objects, the Biefeld-Brown effect, Tesla&#x27;s wireless energy systems, longitudinal</p>
<p>forces in rail guns, the exploding wire phenomenon, Stefan Marinov’s magnetic ionization device, low energy nuclear reactions, plasma-based free energy systems, and that just  scratches the surface. So with that one postulate that the magnetic vector potential and electric scalar potential can each produce a gravitational potential</p>
<p>under the right conditions, you open the door to Star Trek level technology. And because this is all based on real math and not just fanciful imagination, you can work with it, you can simulate it, and you can build with it. So the natural thing to ask is, why don&#x27;t</p>
<p>we then have access to that technology right now? Why don&#x27;t we have flying cars and time travel? Well, it&#x27;s because scalar physics has been suppressed for almost 150 years. Physics took a wrong turn in the late 1800s and vested interests have ensured it never got back on track. There’s a tight system of group-think, censorship,</p>
<p>and suppression in Academia that keeps anything too unorthodox from getting funding for research or approval for publication. The divergence of the magnetic vector potential does indeed show up in physics textbooks, but can you guess what people in Academia have done with it? In their own words, they have murdered it.</p>
<p>When it appears in their equations, they act befuddled and irked because it complicates things. They claim it doesn&#x27;t have any physical significance because they can&#x27;t measure it and don&#x27;t know what it means. They say, &quot;Since it&#x27;s not physically real,</p>
<p>we can make it whatever we want it to be... So why not set it to zero? Or set it to be opposite of whatever the electric scalar potential contributes, so that the two cancel out?&quot; Either way, by imposing these two arbitrary conditions, which they term the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges, they cause the scalar physics part involving gravity to disappear from their equations.</p>
<p>Then they pat themselves on the back for the clever math trick they just pulled and move on But all they&#x27;ve done is artificially restrict themselves, and hence all of modern electrical engineering, to only those cases where there&#x27;s no scalar physics involved. So by saying that the divergence of the vector</p>
<p>potential can&#x27;t be measured, that it therefore has no physical significance, that it can therefore be eliminated from the equations, they have gimped technology to the point where the technology needed to engineer the gravitational potential is prevented from being developed in the first place. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s really sad. It&#x27;s reason most of the planet is trapped in poverty, why the environment is getting polluted, why wars are being fought over oil, and it&#x27;s why we haven&#x27;t colonized other planets yet and therefore risk extinction during the upcoming global cataclysms.</p>
<p>Mainstream physics has been intentionally handicapped to keep humanity in a cage. The good news is that all that suppression can’t prevent smart people from pursuing it on their own time, which is why I’m making this video, to clue anyone interested into the keys to realizing the holy grail of physics</p>
<p>that will support the next phase of human civilization. Well, that&#x27;s it for a basic intro on scalar physics. Be sure to visit scalarphysics.com for papers and references that cover this topic in greater detail.</p>
