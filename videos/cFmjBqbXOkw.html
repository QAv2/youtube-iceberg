            <p>i&#x27;m tim ventura and we&#x27;re joined today by gary stephenson an aerospace systems engineer with wide-ranging industry experience at organizations including nasa united technologies lindquist boeing ipt and hughes aircraft company gary has had a deep interest in gravity modification and advanced propulsion for decades and has published numerous scientific articles on various topics related to the detection and generation of high frequency gravitational waves in this presentation gary will review dr hal pudov&#x27;s 2018 lecture on the atip program and dr jack sarfati&#x27;s 2021 analysis of the tic tac uap warp drive he will also discuss a method for generating gravito magnetic propulsion as proposed by dr robert l forward okay uh this is an extract from uh um hal butthole talk that he that he did in 2018 it was essentially the first time that a tip program was introduced to the public i i think it was a little bit overlooked so i wanted to just give the highlights out of that to show where where this uh this cyp program uh called a tip is overlapping with my work he picked a pretty obscure venue to to release this talk at it was a international remote viewers association our irva conference and so um i guess it&#x27;s a good one if you want to kind of bring it in out of the radar uh which which is sort of what&#x27;s happened it&#x27;s been three years now that this talk has come out and people are still now finally coming to grips with what&#x27;s in this talk uh there&#x27;s a link here too so tim if you wanted to post this after the conference people can go to that youtube link and i would encourage anybody who&#x27;s interested in this to to actually go see house talk instead of getting my regurgitation of it this was given um uh as an introduction to the dod&#x27;s uh uap program he had the backstory and the forward story in other words what&#x27;s going on so far that hasn&#x27;t really been visible to the public and what&#x27;s coming up what&#x27;s going on so far is the defense intelligence agency raised concerns about some of the observations of advanced aerial vehicles uh of unknown origin and so they initiated a program called atip advanced aerospace threat identification program in june of 2007. so this has been going on now for if we do the math what almost 15 years um so when i when i was complaining at my last talk that the government&#x27;s not doing anything about it that&#x27;s not strictly true this program is a very small program but it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing it was funded by congress with harry reid and a couple other senators listed there and uh it was a matter of national security because reid&#x27;s statement was if if we don&#x27;t know the answers um you know to the questions but uh we don&#x27;t take the lead in trying to answer them other countries might take the lead so this was to try to get out in in front of uh other competing nation states trying to figure this out before we did a big part of hal&#x27;s talk was this nimitz encounter the interesting thing about the nimitz encounter was it showed intentionality uh when they announced a cap point to the f-18 fighters cap is a combat assembly point uh the uav sorry the the uap went to the cap point almost instantaneously before the fighters did so that showed number one they were monitoring somehow our communications number two the intentionality of knowing what what was about to happen and going there before the fighters went there so that was extremely alarming to the military and that was one of the reasons this was a watershed case uh the other reason was because we had so many sensors on it and so even though these things uh tend to not reflect radar in a way that would at least in a way that would lead to a radar track you can see them on visual and you can see them on infrared imagery uh here&#x27;s the visual imagery it was glowing white uh they think jack and and actually during his talk hal pothoff shared some of the theories of why these glow white i think perhaps the the infrared uh emission the black body radiation emission that we normally see on infrared gets upshifted it&#x27;s blue shifted to the visual so that&#x27;s why in many many of these sightings uh the craft seems to appears to be glowing it could be glowing in the visual because the uh black body radiation is getting blue shifted which would also account for why it looks black in the infrared not because it&#x27;s cold but because of all the infrared energy is being up shifted to the visual so it appears to be dark like there&#x27;s no thermal there&#x27;s like a black hole in thermal space like there&#x27;s no thermal signature whatsoever that could be uh the up shifting uh so based on some of these alarming sightings uh defense intelligence agency released a broad area announcement it was unclassified at the time there were 12 potential threat areas they wanted to investigate i&#x27;ll just list them here our propulsion was one of them and propulsion using gravity manipulation obviously was one of those particular areas that would overlap with some of my interest areas there were a number of bids for the prime contract dia chose bigelow aerospace to control the a-tip program as a prime contractor so they did the leg work of gathering all of the small subcontracts together and doling out the money to the subcontractors and help shared during his talk that he was one of the subcontractors to the a-tip program offer a number of different studies and that uh earth tech international therefore benefited from the a-tip program through bigelow aerospace and bigelow aerospace was interested enough in this that they formed their own a new division called bass the tech surveys included a number of areas i&#x27;m interested in super using superconductors for gravity research doing space-time metric engineering um one that i know that eric davis was especially interested in and eric davis worked at earth tech at the time was traversable wormholes and so eric did did a number of papers on that you were allowed to publish these papers in open literature they were just after the answers they didn&#x27;t really care whether you published or didn&#x27;t publish some more tech survey areas included negative mass propulsion which which might be through a polarizable vacuum or some other technique like like we saw with todd&#x27;s paper uh anti-gravity obviously for aerospace would be an overlap of gravity control type application and gravity wave communication was specifically called out as one of the tech study areas in 2007 2003 was the very first international high frequency gravity wave conference uh 2000 that was 2003 2007 was the second one the second one was hosted by earth tech international in austin texas uh with help off so it&#x27;s probably not a coincidence i didn&#x27;t know at the time that atp was funding it but it&#x27;s probably not a coincidence from a timing point of view that atif was interested in gravity wave communication and that hal would choose to host a conference in in gravity waves uh the the exact same year also included in house paper was some artifacts uh this was allegedly uh a crash retrieval sample a cr sample uh given to mailed directly to art bell uh who was the radio host at the time uh you know doing doing a lot of radio shows about uap phenomena and things like that and the person that sent it to him remained anonymous but claims to be a crash recovery operative that worked for the military and then he secreted away uh one small sample and sent it to art bell as proof of alien artifacts and of of uap crashes this particular sample was a bismuth magnesium uh not so much a an alloy as a multi-layer um sample and i think i have uh yeah this this was a skinny electron micrograph of of a slice of the sample and so i think this as is dated may 1996 so this is pretty old data that we&#x27;re dealing with the interesting thing about this sample is because it was it was released to art val and it was already in the public eye um that people working with the sample were were able to work with it out in the public so this was all publicly available information which wouldn&#x27;t typically be the case with crash recovery samples it was turned over for instance directly to the military uh or to the intelligence community uh there&#x27;s a mystery about why it was structured the way it was structured but as we saw advances in meta materials we it became obvious that the intent of this material was was to behave as a meta material exactly why and how it&#x27;s behaving as a meta material is it for propulsion is it for reflecting gravity it&#x27;s not real super clear yet but it did appear to be a negative index uh waveguide style material which very much lined up with the literature on negative refractive index material random materials in the terahertz range so um i think this was the point that hal was making in his talk uh other interesting cases were listed in this talk as now being opened back up by atip one of the aspects of a tip that&#x27;s interesting is they they are okay with reaching out to foreign governments whereas our government may not be willing to do that the a-tip program is able to do that through a venue all we&#x27;ll get to in a second here but some of the cases that they wanted to gather was for instance the clarus island encounter which was off the coast of brazil uh happened in the 70s and it was quite long and ongoing i think it turned into multiple weeks this encounter and i think there were at least three dozen cases of physiological effects and injuries that occurred with the eyewitnesses that were located co-located there during the encounter and looking at that database it did appear that there was a lot of radiation style either uv or x-ray exposures um so that again tended to indicate but potentially some balloon shifting um uh of of radiation that&#x27;s either being emitted by the craft or being reflected by the craft uh another aspect of atip program is the formation of a of a public private partnership called to the stars academy so so the stars academy is is uh largely uh created for outreach um so this is a sec regulated public benefit corporation so it&#x27;s supposed to be for the benefit of the public and the public can invest in it if they want and it&#x27;s set up for public outreach uh so so if if you see public releases for instance of footage uh that to the stars academy would be one of the ways that the military can can get this stuff out into the public you&#x27;ll see here the name louis uh is it pronounced elizondo i i&#x27;ve seen him only a couple times but he has a show on history channel yeah i think it&#x27;s a great show the few episodes that i&#x27;ve seen has a lot of new information he&#x27;s getting this information through the atip program he was the former director of the youtube program so he has a lot of contacts still in atip and so we&#x27;re able to get as the public a lot of information released that way and enhance the shows they also help produce the show so if you know if he needs production money uh the to the stars academy will produce that and then we&#x27;ll collect the proceeds from the show as they as they help license the show and release the show and so this is a way of of controlling and accelerating outreach and release of information uh so they&#x27;re legitimizing that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very clear that they&#x27;re proud of this this is something that they want to do is legitimize the uap topic into the mainstream press and a lot of the press releases are vetted through them and they&#x27;re also getting a great quality of sources you know in terms of the interviews that they get and so on that you&#x27;ll see you know in elizondo&#x27;s show very impressive um group of people you know including like the f-18 pilots that were eyewitnesses and so on so i this is a forming a community of interests uh if you go to the to the stars academy website you&#x27;ll see a lot of the uap people and i&#x27;m sure a lot of them are on this call that that are exchanging data and exchanging information and exchanging analysis of uap data so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of the highlights of of this talk it&#x27;s only about 45 minutes long but i could certainly recommend it to everyone i think that was my last slide on that the other thing i wanted to show here before we get too far into my paper uh was some work that jack serfati did under the auspices probably of the atip program he is a researcher for those who don&#x27;t know jack that doesn&#x27;t typically have the patience to publish in journals he basically publishes straight to the internet he has the community of interest that he participates in uh and so when he comes up with a new idea about how these things might be working he&#x27;ll just get it out there right away and so this is a paper he did in january of this year that has been circulating since it&#x27;s now may so this has been four months old but probably a lot of people have not seen it yet so i just wanted to point out a few of the highlights of this particular form formulation it&#x27;s different than what i normally use general relativity space-time metric formulation when i&#x27;m looking at general relativity and gravity uh this is a little different um just to give you a background uh this is the name of the formalism it&#x27;s arnaut desner misner uh the adm so-called adm formulation and that you can find it on scholarpedia it&#x27;s also on wikipedia let me go to the wikipedia i can scroll over here [Music] and it uses these um this lapse vector and this shift vector so you&#x27;ll see these ends show up uh these ends are a description of of how the field evolves as the field is is is flowing through matter so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a field-oriented hamiltonian description of of the space-time uh of of the shape of space-time versus the space-time metric formulation let&#x27;s see if i can get back to jack&#x27;s talk here let&#x27;s see here so we&#x27;ll see in here these ends those those are uh the vectors i&#x27;m referring to the lag and shift vectors uh so you&#x27;ll see that in the formulation so here&#x27;s an element a ds element of space time metric and it&#x27;s formulated with respect to these ends it&#x27;s also formulated with respect to this s he has two references in here and um let&#x27;s see if i can get those references up one is the medina reference energy momentum tensor of electromagnetic fields that is being added in here uh in the s part of this that&#x27;s this little s here that&#x27;s the energy momentum tensor here uh and this is the description of it here and what this does is is describing a permeability and permittivity of not free space but inside of matter so if you have ordinary matter that&#x27;s isotropic this s matrix would be describing the permittivity of permeability of matter and how that affects the wavefront of of an electromagnetic wave or a gravity wave going through matter and it also has enough complexity from a tensor point of view that can describe uh meta materials so we had the question earlier from todd has anyone actually done an experiment yet that requires the tensor behavior well if we do an experiment with metamaterials then then yes until then no so this this is a way of capturing uh in a formulation of of a metric of a space-time metric the impact of matter uh and so he does that here and he&#x27;s even describing that if if if you do it um either in a redshifting way or in a blue shifting way you can get attractive or propulsive gravity effects uh or effects that are on your um a gravitational wave uh wave front as if you&#x27;re getting a blue shift or a red shift so his point is he&#x27;s combining two different papers one on energy momentum tensor another on this wavefront uh formulation um of of gravity that&#x27;s a little different than the space-time metric and that if you formulate that way you can see how if you if you get a matter that&#x27;s interfering with the wave front you can get a blue shift or a red shift out of it so this blue shift is uh is going to be happening if if they need if the craft needs repulsion if the craft is moving away from you you will see the blue shift if it&#x27;s moving toward you presumably and the propulsion is happening behind it you would see that the redshift so it may depend upon the angle at which you&#x27;re viewing the uap as to as to how it appears uh so that&#x27;s that s matrix um he has he has renamed that the surfati matrix of course being jack and that&#x27;s going to be in my paper here appearing in my paper which is different than the last time i get this paper i gave this paper to marcel grossman 15. uh i guess going on three years ago now russell grossman used to happen every two years because because of kovid it&#x27;s this next one mg16 has been delayed a year so it should have happened last year it&#x27;s going to be happening this summer instead so this is a paper i&#x27;m preparing and i just submitted the abstract today so if it&#x27;s accepted i will be presenting it to marcel grossman it has not been accepted yet so it&#x27;s for presentation but it may or may not happen the other thing is i would love to get more details from william reichen on what kind of primitivity his wires could have in terms of the insulation around the wires and you&#x27;ll see why that&#x27;s important in a moment uh presentation outline i wanted to introduce so that the topic of this here is gravido magnetic field generation we&#x27;re trying to use gravity magnetic effects to do a scalar field in the center of this sms device sms is just a toroid of superconducting magnetic energy storage toroid um and so these these devices are typically used for storing energy like a battery but we can also repurpose them for making a gravity magnetic field and i&#x27;ll show you how to do that in a second but using high permittivity is the new part here because if you&#x27;re using permittivity materials the coupling to from a current of a mass flow a third derivative of a mass flow uh that third derivative coupling to the gravitational effect will be much strengthened using this s matrix so first i want to talk about uh historically uh we saw the dewitt talk in jeremy&#x27;s paper so dewitt was one that picked up on this forward coil formulation how do superconductors how can superconductors be used to to enhance the gravida magnetic effect and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s essentially what a forward coil is i&#x27;m giving giving you a little background on on williams superconducting nanowire where&#x27;s the tech right now he has the highest technology in terms of superconducting nanowires of anyone in the world so i much prefer you know at least in theory to use his his nanowires ahead of everyone else&#x27;s because of their extremely high current density i&#x27;ll talk about a little bit of the impact of high index or high permittivity and then see how that impacts the force equation look at the currents inside of s messes and then what kind of forces come out of that so what is a forward coil well robert forward who was a researcher at hughes research labs in malibu california he was a contemporary of mine we didn&#x27;t overlap but he was very long uh hit most of his work was in the 60s and 70s and so by the time i got to hughes in 83 he was already getting towards the end of his career although i think he&#x27;s still stuck out there until the 90s before he finally retired uh but he was continuing to to show up at hughes and give paper so he was a fascinating guy to to listen to and get to know and he&#x27;s terribly missed but one of the things he did before uh he passed was this forward coil concept where if you have a mass flow an inspiring mass flow that it will produce um a gravida magnetic field surrounding the mass flow and and that field will will tend to be additive in the center of the of the of the coil and tend to be subtractive on the outer edges of the coil and because the coil is tighter wound in the middle and looser around on the outside there there is a net positive flow if if you have mass or matter in the middle that mass or matter in the middle will be impacted by that additive gravido magnetic effect now it&#x27;s a very very small effect but there is an additive effect to the gravity magnetic flow if it&#x27;s always in spiraling you see around the toroid so he described this equation uh with with one one change and there&#x27;s this s matrix we&#x27;re talking about that came from sarfati&#x27;s scaling factor paper uh and and it scales according to the number of turns n uh the change in mass flow uh t dot the uh r squared is the cross sectional radius of the toroid and big r is the overall radius of the toroid and if you look at his original 62 paper he derives that equation so it pops out of the general relativity field equations um so that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at the s is the new part the s was not in the 1962 paper how how can we do this how can we build one in my marcel grossman paper of of three years ago in 2018 i proposed using william rankin&#x27;s nanowires and i think this this is actually i should credit uh william i&#x27;ll have to change the slide and credit william because i think this was actually his artist that put together this rendering uh you&#x27;ll see 30 nanometer nanometer diameter another 25 nanometer of insulation uh then there&#x27;s a protective abrasion resistant protection here layer and um sorry this is the high strength filament which which could be for instance kevlar and then the abrasion resistant sleeve so multi-layer uh wire here you can stack them very very densely so here we&#x27;re seeing in you know a stack of like 16 or so nanowires in a one micron diameter so very dense uh very dense stacking in here especially when you consider these 30 nanometer superconducting um essentially formed nanorods of wire will will carry hundreds of amps of current uh before you get to the critical current density uh this is just an equation of motion of the electrons uh this would be a cross section you&#x27;re looking at here of the toroid the electrons then going around the radius of the toroid around that circumference circulating as they grow through the superconductor so that&#x27;s the equation of motion for the electrons and you can get out of that uh this t dot term that&#x27;s uh the change in mass flow of of some single electron uh this is the geometry i&#x27;m using uh the reason i want to point this out in in my 2018 paper it was times 100 this so instead of 5 centimeters it was 5 meters of radius so it was a 10 meter device this is a 10 centimeter device much easier to build um as a cross section of one centimeter so this is a tiny device you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tiny it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not now it&#x27;s not something that you didn&#x27;t need a whole huge giant lab you could do this in a single room um i&#x27;m sectionalizing this uh the nice thing about sectionalizing is you can you don&#x27;t need to run the current as an sms device you can modulate the current maybe even make a gravitational wave with this device if you do a quadrupole moment that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the our that would be a different talk my talk here everything&#x27;s just flowing like a dc current flow all the time through the tutorial so if you take a cross-section of one of these pieces of pie there&#x27;s there&#x27;s the outer winding and then there&#x27;s the inner windings the outer winding loops around if you use a core which these sms devices do use a core i think for for this particular application you don&#x27;t want to use a core because the magnetic field strength isn&#x27;t what you want what you want here is just the current so you want as much current as you can without that magnetic field strength because it&#x27;s the current that&#x27;s giving you the gravitational magnetic field not the magneticism okay it&#x27;s the current so you want lots of current without too much magnetism the magnetism can actually work against you it can rip the device apart through lorentz forces if you&#x27;re not careful so these windings have to be very very strong to not be torn apart by lorenz forces the limiting factor on these windings is the the inner winding because the inner white ending is tighter right geometrically than the outer winding uh it&#x27;s the same number of turns in the inner winding as the outer winding so with the standard reason the inner winding is is tighter if we look at that inner winding we can count uh given a geometry how many circumferences of superconducting wire we can fit in each sector and so if it depends upon what is the diameter of those and how many diameters can you stack in so if we look at that we&#x27;re going to say the diameter is 100 microns that&#x27;s that&#x27;s being very generous right we saw that actually we could stack 16 or so uh devices in inside of what was it 10 microns let&#x27;s go back a one micron we can stack 16 of these inside of one micron so we can actually wind it much tighter than what i&#x27;m what i&#x27;m describing here i didn&#x27;t take in other words i didn&#x27;t take full credit of all that we can get away with geometrically because it gets hard to build when you get into the billions of windings so what i&#x27;m doing here is just saying hey every 100 microns we got at least one wire so that&#x27;s 10 10 wires here 177 in the other dimension um so we got those multiplied together 1700 windings in one sector 16 sectors worth of those 28 000 windings i don&#x27;t know um i don&#x27;t want to put william on the spot and ask him how much wire he can make right now but this isn&#x27;t as much wire as billions of miles like i needed on the last device this is you know a few kilometers of wire uh so that&#x27;s number of let me go back so that&#x27;s number of coils that&#x27;s your n so this is the n for our our formula uh next we need t so this is going to be we&#x27;re going to be non-relativistic so i don&#x27;t want to run this too hard so if i run at 16 um kilovolts uh we get a we get a velocity out of that of the electrons we have a mass electrons mv squared over r gives us our t dot so we&#x27;re getting a t dot per electron of this many newtons to the minus 13th or so to the minus 12 actually newtons of of mass flow change per electron then if we look at a delta t here over the current times the current we can get a number of electrons and we can scale up that per electron number using a number of electrons so i think this is in a single loop right single loop circulation how many electrons just in one loop and it depends on the current so i think we&#x27;re going to assume a j of 250 mega amps per meter squared is a number i got for milliamp which is about 2 amps so we&#x27;re we&#x27;re not this isn&#x27;t an extreme extremely high current version this is this is a very modest 2 amp version of this material still 2 amps is allowed to run through 30 nanometers right so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s pretty impressive um so this is then the number of electrons if we&#x27;re running two amps per loop so then total force number of electrons times force per electron we&#x27;re getting somewhere around um five millinewtons of integrated centripetal force now how does that then couple to how does that then so that&#x27;s your t dot how does that then couple to the gravitational force well there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of unknowns here we know what n is we know what t is t dot we know what r little r and big r are so that gives us this number here 0.118 newtons we don&#x27;t know what s is we can for an isotropic material calculate a range best case worst case of what s could be we also don&#x27;t really know because we&#x27;ve never experimentally measured um the the gravitational coupling i i think that there has been a very indirect measurement of it by nordvic when he when he did the retro reflector off the moon so we can go look that up as as a nominal value but when we&#x27;re talking about through matter then we also have this uh addison r where which we don&#x27;t know at all how this changes inside of matter does does does matter change the gravitational coupling i would presume so matter has mass but exactly what those factors are we don&#x27;t really know so all i have here is then what are some of the ranges uh so let&#x27;s look first at sarfati&#x27;s s term which would go here in general in einstein&#x27;s general field equations here general relativity field equations uh where ricky you know the space-time curvature is related to mass and energy distribution uh times times your g over c to the four and also thrown in here is an s scaling factor this this uh then can reduce for for the forward coil geometry to this and we have then this s which for an isotropic material is related to permittivity and inverse related to permittivity so you want yes a high index material but what you really want is the high permittivity material and potentially a non-magnetic or low permeability material to maximize the effect um some some super capacitor materials some hot super dielectric materials as so-called sdes okay i have seen to the plus eight so that&#x27;s probably best case and then the coupling um i will have to go back and look at the nordv paper um best case is g over 2 to the c there&#x27;s other formulations that say g over c to the fourth when we when we look at its force coupling i i think it&#x27;s more like c squared but i think i do want to go back and double check that uh with nordvid&#x27;s work our r uh n sub r worst case it&#x27;s unity nothing nothing impacts it uh best case is is we&#x27;re really seeing uh the permittivity or something else like the permittivity impacted so then the case is is is this just being impacted by permittivity is the scaling factor also being being impacted with permittivity does this s also include this you know those those are questions that i still have i i don&#x27;t know the answer so uh what&#x27;s to conclude from this well if you look at these are big ranges of this to this and this to this and this range here uh it&#x27;s all over the map we don&#x27;t know quite what to conclude yet the gravitational force could be anything from 10 to the minus 27 unmeasurably small to enormously large uh so i think it&#x27;s probably not enormously large someone would have measured it by now but is it measurable i think we should build this and find out right so this is really an impetus paper just to say i think this is probably worth doing this experiment now when it was billions of miles of wire um three years ago i would say oh that would be a tough gut to talk anyone into building this but when it&#x27;s 28 000 turns you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a lot more doable so we don&#x27;t know the strength of the impact yet but we do know that high index or high permittivity materials enhance the effect they enhance it enough that we could get nano or micro newtons out of tens of thousands of windings and that&#x27;s um this permittivity you know is significant in strengthening the effect of the field so that in a nutshell is my paper i guess i will uh then go and see if there&#x27;s you know if there&#x27;s any questions</p>
