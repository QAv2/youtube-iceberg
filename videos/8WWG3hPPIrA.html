            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald W SADS founder and chair of the International Society of unified science and president trans Power Corporation commercial customs offer manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today&#x27;s screencast as with most of mine it&#x27;s about the reciprocal system of theory in previous screencasts I&#x27;ve covered the entire macro cosmos including all subjects you see on the right side here this is the macro cosmos database main menu I&#x27;ve covered the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and groups galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies nebula gas and dust and voids now here on the left side here to the back here to the micro cosmos database main menu up to today I&#x27;ve covered solid matter properties in atomic distance very low specific heat energy and entropy from expansion compressibility electrical magnetic properties isotopes and I&#x27;m gonna cover spectra today and future&#x27;s green castle becoming liquid vapor gas matter properties cosmic elements and subatomic particle properties and photon properties all right so let&#x27;s go to spectra top right is always the same and this database here we have iron as the element and by the way this is only for atomic spectra nobody&#x27;s worked out the molecular spectra in terms of the reciprocal system although shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to do frankly but I&#x27;ve done a great amount of work on the atomic spectra of every element and here&#x27;s iron for number one tonic molecular weight is here milling temperature thermal factors and compressibility factors there&#x27;s everything is quantized in the suitable system including space and time my decide here has to do with the work function and ionization energies so here we go the work function depends on the escape dimension of the rotational displacements of the atom and specifically the speeds so if we choose the magnetic dimension set of the electric by the way these terms somewhere they have anything even to charge an ordinary atom it&#x27;s just that the magnetic is two dimensional electrical some one-dimensional so we choose them which is the specific speed is three for this and so we calculate a work function as 3.76 the observe the eyes think 29 1 it&#x27;s close enough and then here I calculate the ionization energies in electron volts just like the work function so stage 1 this is 2 times the work function 7 15.7 observe value seven point eight seven zero and then I calculate Z minus 1 and Z and you can see it&#x27;s pretty close not exact but pretty close and the two slopes ionization energies have two segments this is slip of the first segments given my theory and then my best friend that&#x27;s mine too so this is the theory that&#x27;s the best fit to the observer is same thing with the second slope and here we had the individual levels of the ionization energy at each stage varying on the best fit to the observed data and here are the total values which is summing everything before and you can see it&#x27;s pretty close to it not exactly very close well let&#x27;s jump over to here photon properties now we want to know what photons are emitted when they do a transition so here we have the Redbird constant for the isotope frequency and cycles per second and the wave numbers and inverse centimeters here we can even use the theory or the best-fit will use the theory best vêtements the empirical data and we can put in two atomic states here and we&#x27;re using ionization stage 2 and then we have n mm guys for the atomic spectral calculation so let&#x27;s look at this tooltip reciprocal system time-space region thermal translational quantum numbers for atomic for atom the state 1 in the States so these are the N and M values and so we can get the temperature we can get electron volts for thermal energy of the atoms in the state 1 state 2 so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a job see there&#x27;s a drop right there so it it&#x27;s going to emit a photon and then if there&#x27;s a magnetic or electric field applies only to stay tuned that since we&#x27;re doing well that&#x27;s right here there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no issue here ok so the frequency of the photon emitted if we go from ionic stage 2 to 3 to point seven times ten to fifteen cycles per second that&#x27;s energy the result in photon eight point ninety four electron volts as to wavelength and that&#x27;s the Wraiths number and then there can be magnetic let&#x27;s density so if if we had field splitting would get these splits and as you can just sees quite minor it&#x27;s very small if there&#x27;s is on splitting but we can see wave length wave numbers from electric field if there&#x27;s an electric field there&#x27;s no I&#x27;m not using electric field in this calculation but if you let&#x27;s see if you put an electric field up here then we did the splitting here okay so now we can calculate the possible Tomic States given the ionization stage and the observed photon wavelength so if we observe a ten thousand angstrom photon coming out what could have been the states at the annum and you know here we got so there&#x27;s a tolerance function here there&#x27;s an N limit so it&#x27;s gonna go up to ten Maximus or 10 and up to 30 maximum move around and coming state one&#x27;s tommix 82 so we&#x27;re still in the same ionization stage in this particular calculation but we&#x27;re going from 3 and 7 for N and M to 713 so the calculated wavelength comes out to be nine thousand eight ninety seven point one six which is very close to the input ten thousand so this is most likely what happened the atom was had an end I of three and seven and then I went to 7 and 13 and so emitted this my 919 7.16 angstrom Photon and here like the maximum intensity line it at the temperature as the temperature the item a person X intensities so this is an observer the wave numbers that the line with it&#x27;s this and then the intensities calculated complicated Eric&#x27;s per second per centimeter squared per Hertz grad square by the way this is the default for the for doing this iteration on the ends and here&#x27;s okay so that&#x27;s a little complicated you&#x27;ll have to read the the papers so that&#x27;s it for today just closed the south so you can just look at the the two main menus as they talk the simplest possible treatment of the reciprocal system is my original work the unmistakably so many years ago but still in France it has all the concepts many diagrams again so simplest even you can find anywhere about the reciprocal system but if you do want all the mathematics I mean all the mathematics please obtain my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything suddenly are 11 pages in the PDF file and 700 slides in the PowerPoint file thousands and thousands of equations numerous tables figures drawings everything it&#x27;ll take you months to go through and then when you&#x27;re done with that you would get these two database modules micro cosmos database and the macro cosmos database and both these have excellent graphing routines included my theoretical physics Manor DB Larson was also a theoretical economist and I made his work and theoretical economy economics also fully computational that&#x27;s in my optional economist and implementation while sending the Econo physics software program covers the economics and gives the Econo physics equations for individuals especially those if you plan for retirement businesses and business sectors and it also covers the macro economics of whole regions and countries totally supersedes Keynesian economics there&#x27;s free paper you can find online it&#x27;s called theory of microeconomics and macroeconomics large 78 the kind of physics by me I suggest you read that if you really want to understand economics at a very deep level it&#x27;s way better than them which you got me College all right well that wraps it up for today as usual please study the reciprocal system improvement through yourself and thanks for your attention</p>
