            <p>So, we now know a lot more about the programs that are part of Zoron mom Donniey&#x27;s $127 billion budget. And as predicted, ladies and gentlemen, it includes billions poured into diversity and racial equity offices. And so, while you have that going on, meanwhile, he is also telling residents that he won&#x27;t be able to freeze the rent, ladies and gentlemen, which is the reason why many people voted for him in the first place. And so it looks as if Mom Donniey&#x27;s affordability plan he promised voters is shaping up to look not so affordable. As always, if you enjoy the content, smash that thumbs up button.</p>

I know YouTube can act kind of freaky, so hit the notification bell so that we get the updates and alerts. Let&#x27;s get into it. &gt;&gt; Budget is a stunning record high 127 billion for fiscal year 27.</p>
<p>It includes cuts to the New York Police Department, rent freezes, and increased spending on migrants, $1.2 billion for that last one. For comparison here, the mayor&#x27;s proposal is nearly $10 billion more expensive than the entire budget of the state of Florida, even though that state has three times NYC&#x27;s population. Look at the screen. The Wall Street Journal editorial board had some choice words for the mayor. Here&#x27;s quote, &quot;Mr.</p>
<p>from Donnie&#x27;s attempt to extort Ms. Hokll over taxes as part of a broader battle in the Democrat party. If he prevails, expect more Democrats to imitate his class warfare and hostage taking. First of all, &gt;&gt; and so after running an entire campaign centered on affordability, talking non-stop about the cost of living crisis, positioning himself as the solution, now what we&#x27;re seeing are policies that, if anything, move in the opposite direction. And just like that, the whole I&#x27;m gonna make New York more affordable, that message sounds more like a distant afterthought, as now the proposals on the table would certainly increase the cost of living, not reduce them.</p>
<p>And here&#x27;s the thing, Mom Donnie already knew that there were legal limits on what taxes he could impose in New York City. That&#x27;s not new information. Certain tax changes require state approval. He knew that. His team knew that.</p>
<p>They all knew it. Yet during the campaign, it was framed as if he could just flip a switch and make it happen. We&#x27;ll tax the rich and everything will be okay. It&#x27;s just unbelievable when you sit back and you observe this. But let&#x27;s get into more details.</p>
<p>Take a listen. All right. So, he says, &quot;Well, I just don&#x27;t have the money.&quot; But what is he spending it on? Let&#x27;s take a little jog. 5.6 million for the Office of Racial Equity. 4.6 million Commission on Racial Equity.</p>
<p>835,000 Commission on Gender Equity, 260,000 for Department of Education Chief Diversity Officer, 301,000 for three FDNY civilian chief diversity inclusion officers. There&#x27;s a title for you. And 118,000 for an FDNY chief diversity inclusion officers. Is that necessary stuff? You can&#x27;t cut that back. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And a and a list of things to do when it comes to public safety. Absolutely not. Public safety got to be in the top of your list. So some we can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t pay for everything. Everything can&#x27;t be for free.</p>
<p>But what you need is cops out in the street. Tell me how all these programs are going to help when you&#x27;re getting robbed in the middle of the street. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. But what we&#x27;re watching is the old bait and switch.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what it looks like to me at least. Same thing that the governor did down in Virginia. Spamber ran as a moderate and now she&#x27;s creating taxes I didn&#x27;t even know could exist. And now you have mom Donnie. He seems to be more concerned about pushing his social justice agenda even at the expense in the safety of New Yorkers, cutting costs to the police department while pouring billions into programs to push his DEI woke agenda.</p>
<p>And so, you know, we&#x27;ve seen this movie before, whether it&#x27;s Karen Bass, mayor of Los Angeles, Brandon Johnson, the Chicago mayor, who&#x27;s doing such a fantastic job. He&#x27;s about to lose a whole football team to another state because that&#x27;s what happens when businesses are no longer flocking to your city. And so mom Donnie is just the latest example of what happens when you elect a Democrat and they end up making their sole focus social justice and inclusivity policies at all cost even to the taxpayers that they promise to make things more affordable for. And what you get in the end is a financial and cultural disaster. Mandami&#x27;s progressive agenda includes new budgets items like 750,000 for art and cultural fund, 800,000 for anti-agism, 437 million for child care vouchers, LGBTQ emergency for 2 million.</p>
<p>It goes on and on. And you pointed out his climate change budget. What&#x27;s he spending on that? &gt;&gt; Uh something like a climate management office for climate justice. Millions of dollars tied to that. And let me let me tell you something else, Brian.</p>
<p>So, you&#x27;re telling me, let me get this straight. I live in Staten Island, New York. You&#x27;re about to raise my taxes 10% because you&#x27;re trying to pitch and hold the governor into giving you money, which he already gave you uh child care money and I think $1.5 billion bailout. So, you&#x27;re going to raise my taxes 10% and you&#x27;re going to reduce my public safety for my city. That&#x27;s very appetizing for me to stay in New York City, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s very appetizing.</p>
<p>Great for our friends and family and people like you who go to work in New York City. Terrible recipe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, let&#x27;s get to this next part because one of the main things Mom Donnie was promising along with all the free programs, of course, was to freeze the rent. The pitch was that it was greedy landlords.</p>
<p>They were taking advantage of tenants and not even maintaining their buildings or units properly, which I&#x27;m sure it happens. It happens everywhere. Uh but now you know he&#x27;s walking that back because if you I mean if you raise property taxes it becomes kind of hard to tell homeowners we&#x27;re making you pay more but you can&#x27;t charge tenants more. And here&#x27;s the thing not all these landlords are wealthy developers. Some of them own maybe what one or two properties and still work a regular 9 to5.</p>
<p>And those are supposed to be the people mom Donnie said he was looking out for. But let&#x27;s get into it to hear more. Check this out. The mayor continues to say raising property taxes is a last resort, but he does acknowledge that would raise costs for landlords, which may make freezing the rent for 2 million rentstabilized tenants difficult. It was all smiles and cheers while breaking ground on more than 300 units of affordable housing in East Harlem.</p>
<p>But Mayor Zoran Mandani is still taking tough questions about his threat to raise property taxes across the board to help fill a $5.4 4 billion city budget deficit. That is if Albany does not come through with a tax on millionaires and corporations to plug the hole. Nearly every other local leader, including the city&#x27;s moneyman, comproller Mark Lavine, has blasted the notion of even putting property taxes on the table. &gt;&gt; A Brownstone owner in Park Slope pays a lot less than a Brownstone owner in say East New York. So to add more taxes onto that unequal system uh is is unacceptable.</p>
<p>We should not be doing that. &gt;&gt; Any chance you&#x27;re backing off on that potential of raising property taxes? &gt;&gt; So, what we put forward was what we characterized as actions of last resort. What we will spend every day looking towards is working with Albany to increase taxes on the wealthiest and the most profitable corporations such that a fiscal crisis is not resolved on the backs of working and middle class New Yorkers. &gt;&gt; Mdani says reforming the property tax system in general is a priority. He continues to blame mismanagement by former mayor Eric Adams, saying he underbudgeted by up to$ 14 billion dollars.</p>
<p>But regardless of how we got here, the potential of raising property taxes could complicate Mani&#x27;s hope to freeze the rent for rentstabilized New Yorkers. Today, Mdani announced that he seized control of the rent guidelines board to make good on his campaign promise to freeze rents on rent controlled and rent stabilized apartments. Small property owners say the prospect for them is grim. Raising property taxes while at the same time freezing rents would be crushing to small owners, driving us into foreclosure and bankruptcy. It won&#x27;t help Nila Harris, a school teacher who, like most New York City renters, lives in a market rate apartment.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Raising taxes is definitely going to have an effect on my rent. &gt;&gt; How do you think it would affect you? &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re going to raise my rent for sure. Without question. without question. &gt;&gt; Today, Deputy Assembly Majority Leader Charles Fall and State Senator Jessica Sarcella Spanton said they oppose increased taxes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to raise taxes at this point. Right. And &gt;&gt; any taxes, &gt;&gt; any taxes at this point. &gt;&gt; Pat and John Rose live on Staten Island where 70% of residents own their homes. For them, higher property taxes is a bridge too far.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Make the rich pay a little bit more. I got no problem with that whatsoever. None whatsoever. &gt;&gt; But hands off your property taxes. &gt;&gt; The property taxes here are high anyway.</p>
<p>So &gt;&gt; property taxes already went up this year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; From last year. My property taxes went up $500. &gt;&gt; Well, other mayors have faced budget deficits by making painful choices like closing libraries, closing firehouses, or even cutting the massive school budget.</p>
<p>But Mayor Money has made it clear that when it comes to working New Yorkers, austerity is out of the question. So you seen, you heard that. And so Mom Donny&#x27;s proposed budget for New York City alone is 127 billion, ladies and gentlemen. Meanwhile, you got the entire state of Florida, it operates on about 117 billion. And Florida has 23 million people, while New York City has around 8.3 million.</p>
<p>And so if you got one city proposing a budget that&#x27;s roughly $10 billion more than one of the most populous and economically successful states in the country, that should at least make people pause because at some point at at at some point, ladies and gentlemen, the question isn&#x27;t just about revenue. New York has plenty of that. It&#x27;s about the management. And the answer can&#x27;t always be higher taxes. The answer has to include responsible, disciplined governance and making sure that the money already coming in is being used effectively.</p>
<p>Yet, here we are again, another far-left Democrat coming into office, not even hiding the fact that he&#x27;s a Democrat socialist. Let&#x27;s not forget that part. And he immediately floats multi-billion dollar tax increases that would touch virtually every New Yorker. And now suddenly people start waking up and saying, &quot;Wait, wait a second. There should be another way to do this, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, you would think that over time voters would recognize the pattern, right? And maybe some do. Maybe that&#x27;s why people relocate when the cost and policies no longer align with their priorities and hopefully leave their broken ideology behind. Don&#x27;t bring that to a a red state that&#x27;s flourishing like a Florida or like a Texas. But for those who stay and refuse to reassess, the cycle just continues because they refuse to see the writing on the wall with the Democrat party. At least in my opinion.</p>
