Meanwhile, back in the lab, he&#x27;s drawing a picture of a playground with a merrygoround, and he sees the results and he says, &quot;Okay, you&#x27;ve convinced me.&quot; So, it was that kind of thing that would push him over. Yeah, there&#x27;s an example. Now, he misinterpreted what it was.</p>
<p>cuz he thought maybe it was a cupula or whatever. But anyway, that&#x27;s his drawing on the right and that&#x27;s where we were on the left. And so he said so so he went back to CIA and said, &quot;Okay, this stuff really works.&quot; And uh he became one of their star remote viewers over the years.</p>
