            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>You know, in patent law, there are these moments, procedures that really feel like victory, right? The end of a long road. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Years of work sometimes. &gt;&gt; But then you have other procedures that signal, well, delay, indefinite delay, maybe worse, &gt;&gt; right? A costly pause. &gt;&gt; So, what happens when you have those two uh completely different outcomes governed by the exact same piece of paper, the same notice? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s where it gets tricky.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Welcome to the deep dive. Today, our mission is navigating one of the key documents in US patent law, the manual of patent examining procedure, the MPEP. We&#x27;re zeroing in on chapter 1300 today, which is titled allowance and issue, &gt;&gt; the finish line, basically. &gt;&gt; Exactly. This chapter covers those final steps, you know, where a successful application goes from being examined to actually becoming a granted patent.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re looking at a very specific point in that process. A real tightroppe walk administratively speaking, governing changes made right at the very end. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; we are diving into MPP section 1304, amendments after D10 notice. &gt;&gt; Okay, MPAP section 1304. So that immediately raises the question, what exactly is this D10 notice? And if the application&#x27;s already allowed, why are we even talking about amendments still? Seems kind of late in the game, &gt;&gt; right? It does sound counterintuitive.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; The D10 notice is really the key administrative trigger here. Its formal name is the notice of allowance in fees due. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s the official word from the USPTO saying, hey, congratulations.</p>
<p>Your claims look allowable. &gt;&gt; The green light. &gt;&gt; Exactly. The green light. And crucially, it tells the applicant, you&#x27;ve got three months now to pay the issue fee and get this thing granted.</p>
<p>It shifts the whole focus away from examination, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and towards getting it ready for printing and, you know, becoming an actual issued patent. &gt;&gt; So, the application has like functionally left the examiner&#x27;s desk. It&#x27;s in the pipeline for publishing. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a good way to put it. Yeah.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s moving down the administrative track. And that explains why making changes now, these late amendments, is so sensitive. MP section 1304 basically exists to handle the reality that well sometimes amendments do show up after that notice of allowance the D10 has gone out &gt;&gt; right things happen &gt;&gt; things happen but the office&#x27;s big goal at this stage is simple avoid reopening prosecution that&#x27;s the absolute last thing they want &gt;&gt; why is that such a big deal reopening prosecution &gt;&gt; oh it&#x27;s a major bureaucratic headache it means pulling the file back from the issue process the examiner potentially has to look at it again maybe issue another office action It pushes the grant date out by months potentially. It&#x27;s costly, timeconuming. &gt;&gt; Okay, I see.</p>
<p>So the MPP has to be really restrictive here because the cost the administrative cost of having an examiner look at the substantive change just shot way up. &gt;&gt; Precisely. So if an amendment does arrive after that D10 notice, it has to meet some very strict rules. &gt;&gt; Like what what kind of rules? &gt;&gt; Well, primarily it needs to follow the general post allowance rules. You&#x27;ll find related guidance.</p>
<p>Historically, you might look near MPP section 130, but practically it points to rules like uh 37 CFR 1.312 or MP714.16, which deal with amendments after allowance. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And the absolute key rule here, the amendment must be nonsubstantive. &gt;&gt; Nons substantive meaning &gt;&gt; things like fixing typos, uh minor cleanup in the specification, correcting an inventor&#x27;s name, spelling, maybe fixing an obvious error in a drawing, formal stuff. Got it. &gt;&gt; If you try to sneak in new claims or broaden the scope of the ones you already got allowed or do anything that makes the examiner need to say run a new prior art search.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh. Oh, was right. It&#x27;s going to get rejected.</p>
<p>Or worse, it might get treated as a request for continued examination in rce. &gt;&gt; And that forces that whole costly reversal you mentioned back to the examiner. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Back into active prosecution. Big delay, more fees.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, let&#x27;s make this concrete. Say I&#x27;m the practitioner, right? And I spot a small typo in the summary section. Just a spelling mistake. This is two days after the D10 notice arrived. I quickly draft and send in a correction.</p>
<p>Who even looks at that? Is it still the original examiner? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a really good question because it shows how things shift. Once that D10 is mailed, the application generally moves out of the examiner&#x27;s direct control for these kinds of formal issues. &gt;&gt; Okay? Instead, these non-s substantive, purely formal corrections, they&#x27;re typically handled by the Office of Data Management, the ODM. &gt;&gt; Office of Data Management, ODM. Never heard of them, &gt;&gt; right? They&#x27;re essentially the clerical review team for issued patents.</p>
<p>Their job is administrative, making sure everything&#x27;s formally correct for printing and publication. &gt;&gt; So, like quality control for the final document, &gt;&gt; kind of. Yeah. If your typoix is truly just formal, requires zero technical brain power from the examiner, the ODM can often process it, no problem. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; but if that correction, even slightly, touches on the substance, what the invention is or the legal scope of those claims, then the ODM can&#x27;t accept it.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t have that authority &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s when it gets kicked back or rejected. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s when you risk rejection or needing that rce, that big procedural setback. &gt;&gt; Okay. So for this first track, MP1304 is like the gatekeeper. making sure the train heading towards the issue station isn&#x27;t derailed by someone trying to change the cargo last minute.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a perfect analogy. Keeps the train on schedule. You &gt;&gt; you mentioned two tracks. This sounds well complicated but manageable. What&#x27;s the other track? &gt;&gt; Uh yes, the other track.</p>
<p>This is where MPP section 1304 gets uh particularly complex. It has to cover a critical exception. &gt;&gt; An exception. Okay, here&#x27;s where it gets really interesting. I bet &gt;&gt; it does because the MPPP have to mesh its internal rules with well external mandates, national security mandates specifically.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; National security. How does that come into play with amendments after allowance? &gt;&gt; It comes into play via applications under a secrecy order. &gt;&gt; Ah okay. Classified inventions potentially. &gt;&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>MPPP section or 134 basa 1. You&#x27;ll see it indexed under secret application lays out a completely different path. &gt;&gt; How different. &gt;&gt; Totally different. Even if the examiner finds every single claim allowable, determines the invention is perfectly patentable.</p>
<p>If there&#x27;s secrecy order slapped on that application, it cannot issue. Period. &gt;&gt; Even with the allowance, &gt;&gt; even with the allowance, this is under the authority of the law, 35 USC 181, which lets the government basically say, &quot;Hold up. Publishing this could harm national security.&quot; &gt;&gt; Wow. Okay.</p>
<p>So, what happens procedurally then? Does the D10 notice still go out? &gt;&gt; Yes. And this is the crucial, potentially confusing part. The D10 notice is still mailed. &gt;&gt; But wait, didn&#x27;t we just say the D10 is the green light for issue? &gt;&gt; In normal cases, yes. But here, for an application under a secrecy order, that D10 takes on a completely different meaning.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t signal get ready for issue. It signals examination is over, but you&#x27;re now entering an indefinite holding pattern. &gt;&gt; So, it confirms the technical part is done, but the patent is frozen. &gt;&gt; Precisely. The procedural condition is absolute.</p>
<p>The application is intentionally withheld from issue even though it technically passed examination. It&#x27;s stuck in limbo. Patent purgatory, you could call it. &gt;&gt; Patent purgatory. I like that.</p>
<p>So the D10 in this context is basically saying, &quot;Congrats on winning the technical fight, but Uncle Sam says not so fast, and we&#x27;re freezing the clock indefinitely.&quot; &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a pretty accurate summary. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What does that mean practically for the poor applicant? They have an allowed application, but nothing happens. &gt;&gt; Well, the biggest thing is uncertainty. Huge uncertainty.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t enforce the patent. Obviously, they can&#x27;t really commercialize it openly. They have to follow all the rules of the secrecy order itself, handling classified info, maybe restrictions on filing overseas. &gt;&gt; Sounds tough. &gt;&gt; It is.</p>
<p>The D10 in this situation, its main function is just to formally mark the end of examination, which is useful because it sets the stage for eventual issue. if the secrecy order ever gets lifted. &gt;&gt; Okay, so there is an escape hatch. How does the applicant get out of this procedural lock? &gt;&gt; Yes, there is a way out. The procedure has a specific contingency built right in.</p>
<p>And this is really the core of this part of MPP section 1304. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; If the secrecy order is officially withdrawn or rescended after that D10 notice has already been mailed, &gt;&gt; then what? &gt;&gt; And the hold is immediately lifted. Poof. The application instantly snaps back to being treated like any other normal application that&#x27;s ready for allowance and issue &gt;&gt; instantly. Just like that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Administratively, yes, the block is removed. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s walk through that. Say, um, you have an application for some advanced communication tech. January examiner says, &quot;Looks great. Claims allowed, but oh, sensitive government contract involved.&quot; So, boom, secrecy order, right? &gt;&gt; D10 notice goes out.</p>
<p>Allowance confirmed, but process frozen. Now, fast forward maybe three years. The tech is old news or the government declassifies something. The secrecy order is officially withdrawn. What happens the next day at the USPTO? &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>The moment that withdrawal notification hits the right desk at the USPTO and gets processed, it triggers the standard issue process. &gt;&gt; Just picks up where it left off &gt;&gt; pretty much. The fact that the D10 went out 3 years ago doesn&#x27;t matter in a negative way. It&#x27;s actually logged. The USPTO will usually issue an updated notice, likely resetting the clock for paying the issue fee, and then the application moves relatively quickly towards publication and grant.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, no re-examination or anything? &gt;&gt; Nope. The technical part was settled years ago. This is purely about lifting the administrative hold related to national security. It reverts cleanly back to the normal allowance procedures. The issue is just timing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s fascinating. the ability to just pivot instantly like that from a national security freeze back to standard procedure all hanging on how you interpret that one d10 notice it really shows how these MP rules have to interlock doesn&#x27;t it &gt;&gt; it really does it highlights the complexity &gt;&gt; so if we kind of zoom back out and look at MP section 1304 overall what we&#x27;re seeing is this one section acting as the beater for that crucial transition to grant but it&#x27;s playing two completely different roles depending on the context using the same D10 note That&#x27;s the perfect way to summarize it. Absolutely right. This section manages that handoff moment when the application moves from the examiners to the folks handling the printing and issuing. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; so track one, &gt;&gt; it handles the everyday stuff, making sure small nonsubstantive fixes the ones mostly handled by the ODM, remember, &gt;&gt; right? The Office of Data Management.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t gum up the works and delay the grant. That&#x27;s the first key takeaway. D10 notices signal allowance. Yes, but they still allow for these very limited postnotice amendments. &gt;&gt; Got it.</p>
<p>Limited amendments. Okay. &gt;&gt; Then track two. It defines that big pause button for national security. That&#x27;s the second takeaway.</p>
<p>Applications under secrecy orders. They stay withheld from issue even if they&#x27;re technically allowed. The D10 just confirms the technical win, not the imminent grant. &gt;&gt; Withheld despite allowance. Makes sense.</p>
<p>And finally, it provides the release mechanism. The third takeaway, if that secrecy order gets withdrawn after the D10 notice, the application snaps right back to the normal allowance procedure, ready to finally issue &gt;&gt; escape clause activated. &gt;&gt; Exactly. So, it&#x27;s one section handling everything from fixing typos to dealing with, you know, potentially classified technology, clerical cleanup to global security issues. &gt;&gt; It really underscores the stakes at this final stage, doesn&#x27;t it? You absolutely have to be precise.</p>
<p>You need to know these rules inside out because trying to slip in a substantive change after the D10, that could cost your client months, thousands in fees for an RCE. &gt;&gt; Yep. Big mistake. &gt;&gt; And being under a secrecy order, that could mean years of just waiting. Unable to use or even talk about your invention freely.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Years of commercial silence, as you put it earlier. That&#x27;s a good phrase for it. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you. This has been incredibly helpful for understanding the nuances of MPAP 1304 and that critical D10 notice. Glad to walk through it.</p>
