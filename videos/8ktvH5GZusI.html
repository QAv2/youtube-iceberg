            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel I do educational stuff on this channel uh stuff that is uh hard to find hard to come by hard to understand uh trying to uh walk you through it uh without uh sacrificing the author&#x27;s two words and uh we are on video number 190 on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson we&#x27;ve looked at a couple of Larson&#x27;s books so uh one of his uh talks and a few uh biographical uh videos but we are now looking at the book called Nothing But motion that came out in 1979 the basic idea of Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is made out of motion not matter and not energy or not anything else but motion and motion is the relationship between space and time okay so space and time are set up there to be in a reciprocal relationship motion is a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and um timer space come in multi-dimensions three or more Dimensions that is what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time XYZ coordinates for space and something analogous to that in time and then we also have the scalar aspect which is called clock time and clock space clock time time is always getting later and later and later it&#x27;s progressing or it&#x27;s flowing and so to space is also progressing and flowing which you would visualize by taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on it with a magic marker and then blowing up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other uh then you suck in the balloon all the dots are moving toward each other so scalar motion is a motion that has no particular direction uh but it does have a magnitude and in the the direction is really either in or out that&#x27;s that&#x27;s all you have that&#x27;s a one-dimensional scalar motion now there are three dimensions of scalar motion ultimately but we only really can observe one at a time and uh then space and time also have their discrete unit uh-ness and so the um space and time are not continuous they come in chunks they come in quantized chunks there&#x27;s a smallest unit of time and a smallest unit of space uh and if you have one unit of space in in one unit of time or per one unit of time the fraction space over time space over time is speed the car is moving 35 miles per hour 35 miles of space in one hour of time uh one unit of time in one unit one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is basically set up as the one in this universe uh which has uh inverse two inverse sectors uh where you would use multiplication and division uh to understand that like so in the conventional system you start with zero and then you know this is plus and this is minus but with the reciprocal system you start with one and this is uh one times x and this is one divided by X so it&#x27;s a multiplicative uh end of division divisive divisive I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s the right word but based on Division uh in the uh in the reciprocal system so in Larson&#x27;s system that speed of light is the midpoint of the universe it&#x27;s the null point the zero point the the uh natural the natural reference system the progression of the natural reference system or even The Ether the origin of the universe and there&#x27;s a half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light along with the half of the universe moving slower than the speed of light which is the half that we&#x27;re familiar with which Larson calls the material sector and that&#x27;s where Einstein you know comes up with his his uh dictum that nothing can move faster than the speed of light that is true for the material sector but on the other side of the boundary faster than the speed of light the speed of light is the minimum speed of the universe Larson calls this the cosmic sector and we don&#x27;t know basically anything about the cosmic sector but since we know everything or a lot about the material sector uh all we have to do is extrapolate over to the cosmic sector because of the reciprocal relationship between space and time so what&#x27;s going on in the material sector the exact same thing is going on in the cosmic sector except that you reverse the roles of space and time in the material sector you have coordinate space three-dimensional space and clock time the clock is progressing and uh it&#x27;s in this XYZ coordinates but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time that are uh in that are progressing or flowing through space uh clock space so you have the opposite relationship three-dimensional time three-dimensional space one dimensional time over here you&#x27;ve got three dimensional time and one dimension of space progressing okay so that&#x27;s basically uh you know the short version um and uh in this book nothing but motion we are in Chapter 13 which is on fundamental constants and so what Larson does this uh book is primarily on like Atomic physics uh with some uh organic chemistry also um but what Larson does is he he he starts with that Universe those initial postulates and he derives uh deductively uh okay if these were the basic rules if the universe is made out of motion motion is a relationship between space and time they both have their coordinate and and their uh clock aspects and they come in discrete units and the universe is uh follows ordinary community of mathematics and and euclidean geometry which is not totally necessary but that&#x27;s part of his postulates if you have those param diameters then you go through a process of deduction okay if this then that well then if this then that and so that is uh covered in about 15 videos that I did earlier on his talk called the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system but so what happens when he does that is he deduces a theoretical universe and then he basically tries to match it up with the scientist Universe from observation and measurement and that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s doing here in this chapter is he we just got done with him deriving mathematically and theoretically um the all these different numbers which are what he calls secondary mass and he uses this these secondary Mass numbers in order to calculate the mass of all these different subatomic particles so here he says we may now apply the calculated values of the several Mass components as given in the foregoing paragraphs to a determination of the masses of the subatomic particles described in chapter 11. for convenience these values will be recapitulated as follows okay so we have primary Mass primary mass is 1.000 and then we have magnetic Mass which is uh 0.00639205 that he got from the fraction um 9 over 1408 which is um which is uh the uh the reciprocal of uh 156.44 and that comes from uh he explained it earlier it comes from 128 which is the number of different uh the number of directions but then because you have a uh within an atom you have two photons that uh so that it adds an additional two-ninths to that number so you have 128 times 11 over 9. you take the reciprocal of that you get .00639205 then for gravitational Mass you add those two numbers together the one and the .00639205 so you get 1.00639205 that is the gravitational Mass but now you can also throw in the electric mass in three dimensions that number and then he uses uh 128 times 1 9 in this situation because they&#x27;re in different regions so you have to multiply them rather than adding them and you get .00.00086806 and if that is in two Dimensions only then it is uh 0.0.00057870 and then you have the mass of the normal charge and that is uh done by multiplying consecutive inter-regional ratios that number 156.44 that is uh 0.000 44.94 and uh the negative electron charge which is two-thirds of that but negative um which is uh negative zero point zero zero zero zero two nine nine six so he&#x27;s getting down to pretty exact numbers and eventually we&#x27;re going to get around to comparing those numbers to the um the the found values that the Legacy scientists have come up with through their observations um now what what this is is really this is a natural scale so it has to be converted to the uh conventional scale the scientists scale so sometimes he has to use a conversion factor to convert from natural units uh coming from the reciprocal system with the conventional units that the scientists have used which are often arbitrary but not always okay um these are the masses of the various components on the natural scale the measured values are reported in terms of a Scale based on an um Arbiter or I would say arbitrary based on an arbitrary assumed mass for some atom or isotope that is taken as a standard okay that&#x27;s generally how the the Legacy scientists do it they say Okay hydrogen is number one for example so um we will base our scale on that for example in this case they use actually they use oxygen 60 the 16 uh Oxygen 16 isotope 16. um okay for a number of years there were two such scales in common use the uh okay let me go back here the measured values are reported in terms of a Scale based on an arbitrary assumed mass for some atom or isotope that is taken as a standard for a number of years there were two such scales in common use the chemical Scale based on the atomic weight of oxygen as 16 and the physical scale which is assigned the 16 value to the zero to the Oxygen 16 isotope more recently a Scale based on an atomic weight of 12 for the carbon-12 isotope has found favor and most of the values given in the current literature are expressed in terms of the C12 scale in the light of the finding of this work the shift away from the old 16 scale is unfortunate as the theoretical development indicates that the o16 isotope has a direct it has a mass C exactly 16 on the natural scale and the physical scale is therefore coincident with the natural scale it will of course be necessary to use the natural scale for our purposes The observed values quote for comparison with the oretical masses will therefore be stated in terms of the equivalent Oxygen 16 physical scale here again we Face the same issue that was encountered early in this chapter in connection with the selection of an empirical value C Avogadro&#x27;s number as a basis for calculating the unit of mass the question as to whether we should regard the most recent determination as the most accurate it would appear that the arguments that led to the acceptance of the 1957 value of Avogadro&#x27;s Number are also applicable to the particle masses particularly since the agreement between the calculated and observed masses of the electron and proton is quite satisfactory on this basis the empirical values cited in the paragraphs that follow have therefore been taken from the 1957 compilation by Cohen Crow and dumong this since mass is three-dimensional an independent one-dimensional or two-dimensional rotation has no Mass nevertheless when such a rotation becomes a component of a three-dimensional rotation it contributes to the mass equivalent of that rotation this amount that a rotation which is massless when independent will add to the mass of a particle or atom when it joins that combination of motions constitutes what we call potential Mass in the case of the particles with no effective two-dimensional rotational displacement the electron and the positron the appropriate unit of electric mass is uh 0.00057870 is the entire mass of the particle and even that mass is only potential rather than actual as long as the particle is in the basic uncharged condition when a charge is added the effect of the charge is distributed over all three dimensions by the chance process that governs the direction of the directions of motion of the charge in the time region and again that is uh the chance process because it&#x27;s a scalar motion scalar motion doesn&#x27;t have a direction uh so the directions are determined by chance um and in the time region thus the charged particle has effective Motion in all three dimensions irrespective of the number of dimensions of rotation this not only makes the mass of the charge itself an effective quantity but as indicated in chapter 11 it also raises the potential mass of the rotation of the particles to the effective status the net effective mass of the electron or the positron is then the rotational value 0.00057870 less the mass of the charge 0.0002996 or 0.00054874 The observed value is 0.00054877 okay so um he&#x27;s got it correct exactly out to the first uh seven decimal places the massless neutron the m uh one half dash one half Dash zero combination again those are the three uh rotations that go to form the atoms and subatomic particles the first number is the primary magnetic two-dimensional rotation the second number is the secondary two-dimensional rotation and the third number is the one-dimensional electric uh rotation an atom is a combination of motions in general a combination of rotations so the massless neutron has that notation m m meaning it&#x27;s in the material sector and then one half dash one half Dash zero has no effective rotation in the third dimension but no rotation from the natural standpoint is rotation at unit speed from the standpoint of a fixed reference system this rotational combination therefore has an initial unit of electric rotation with a potential mass of 0.00057870 in addition to the mass of the two-dimensional basic rotation which is 1.0063205 making the total potential mass of this particle 1.00697075 in this connection it should be noted that the electron and positron also have rotation at unit speed no rotation in terms of the natural system in the two inactive Dimensions but those rotations involve no mass as they are independent and are not rotating anything the initial unit of rotation in the third dimension of the massless neutron on the other hand is a reverse rotation of the two-dimensional structure and it therefore adds an electric mass unit um okay I think we&#x27;re gonna stop there he&#x27;s gonna get into the neutrino next uh calculating the mass for the neutrino but this is all just pointing out how Larson derives a theoretical Universe of his universe purely from his theory and the deductions thereof and then he Compares it with the actual scientific uh you know numbers uh that they got from their observations and measurements okay thanks for tuning in we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow have a great day</p>
