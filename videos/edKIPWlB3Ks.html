            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>this is Hannibal from the Hannibal TV on YouTube going to introduce another clip right now from the engaging the phenomena podcasts an interview my friend James did with Lou alzando former head of the pentagon&#x27;s UFO program this clip is of Lou talking about remote viewing and unacknowledged special access programs why am I posting clips from this interview because not as many people saw it that should have originally and by the way the full interview link is in the description want to get more attention on it also James from the engaging the phenomenon podcast is doing a live interview with me January 9th right here on the Hannibal TV there&#x27;s a lot of UFO interviews coming up so please subscribe and enjoy this clip from James um and you know speaking of a tip was uh you know I know AAP kind of may have utilized this but was there ever ever any kind of remote viewing um talked about in in a tip and if not aat maybe um well James uh you uh you definitely threw me for a curve on that one uh let me let me think about the way to respond to this um I&#x27;m going to Def refer to some of my colleagues if you want an answer to that question I would talk to U folks like Hal POF uh I I don&#x27;t want to answer that&#x27;s that&#x27;s their area of expertise uh and um I&#x27;ll just I&#x27;ll just leave it at that un acknowledged special access programs get brought up a lot especially when talking about the UFO subject um so are you know there are such a thing as unacknowledged special access programs or the waved saps of course there are yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s in law you can you can see that you know yeah this I forget which title it is I remember Christopher melan actually he named the whole title yeah and and there&#x27;s also covered action which is under title 50 but you know that&#x27;s all this is is is these are mechanisms to the more sensitive of an effort you have um the more you want to protect it from the enemy and so the more you compartmentalize it how do you connect um oversight Community or or or bodies sure to even I&#x27;ll give you an example you know with covert action you have the the gang of six and gang of 12 you know there&#x27;s always oversight even no matter how secret something is somebody in the chain of command has to know period even if it&#x27;s waved a bigoted sap and when I say bigoted people say bigoted what does that mean a big list yeah right it&#x27;s bigot list um you know either waved or un acknowledged saps um someone is still in the loop someone has to be and and that all because you&#x27;re spending taxpayer money someone has to be held accountable otherwise you run into issues like we did with operation yellow fruit so so there is always an accountability uh lane somewhere and uh if if if these saps are being run without that accountability then they&#x27;re not real saps then they&#x27;re Rogue operations then these are operations that are running uh under the radar uh and and frankly are illegal because there there are very specific guidelines if you want to run those type of programs and and you can&#x27;t deviate from those at all so um you know I I I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s some waved or unnoted sap at this point if they are they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re scared shitless because right now the gig is up they know if it gets found out that they&#x27;ve been running these Rogue operations with no accountability they&#x27;re done they&#x27;re they&#x27;re going to jail I mean you know today so uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not um it definitely would not I would be very surprised if if there was some of Rogue operation now I do think there may be some Legacy efforts that are falling under uh authorities that were were were once put down and now forgotten um it&#x27;s not uncommon that a a memo establishing a program from some Secretary of Defense in 1978 is still being used you know we still use for example the National Security Act of 1947 a lot of the new rules and regulations that we have coming out of the department and the intelligence Community stem from the National Security Act of 1947 right after World War II it&#x27;s almost been 100 Years and we&#x27;re still putting that if you look at a lot of the dod policies I put out it&#x27;ll say in accordance with you know uh National Security Act of 1947 uh it&#x27;ll say e123 as amended you know and and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the way we do things um and it is not it&#x27;s not impossible because I&#x27;ve seen it a couple times where you run into an organization or or an effort and they&#x27;re saying well we&#x27;re using this as our guiding Authority and you&#x27;re looking like whoa I mean dude I was like in kindergarten when when that memo was signed you might want to get that updated so you think it it&#x27;s possible that there are such programs in in Legacy programs and is that what they&#x27;re actually called Legacy programs Legacy yeah okay so is that feasible you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it is it is uh unlikely but it is certainly with well within the realm of possibility I I I do not doubt that some of those Legacy programs still exist whether it involves the UFO program um to be seen because we&#x27;ve done a lot of digging around and and you know if they exist they&#x27;re really dug themselves deep um which is you know which is I mean kudos to them but you know I I I know where to dig I know where those you know where those where to put the holes in the ground to find what we want to look for um yeah I do think that there may be some some Legacy guidance out there that people may still be using to to not want to have this conversation but I think even more importantly there may be two other issues at hand either the technology is so revolutionary that uh someone has made a decision unilaterally to to not share this even with their own chain of command which is a problem um or the other possibility as well is that um they&#x27;re scared now now they know that there&#x27;s accountability and now they know that someone&#x27;s going to have to face the music and tell Congress and and the American people and and the chain of command that yeah we&#x27;ve been doing this this whole time and we&#x27;ve been doing it under your nose yeah we lied to you we we didn&#x27;t tell you um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a problem uh because there&#x27;s there&#x27;s significant liability there if you imagine some person uh a pilot who who reports an incident and now because of it uh is forced to go undergo psychological evaluation is taken off of flight status and as a result maybe uh is reassigned and now loses his marriage or her marriage because of this and furthermore now becomes homeless and loses everything for doing the right thing it loses everything is now now living on the streets and homeless because they reported a UFO sighting at some point in the past now I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the case but can you imagine the liability what we would have to owe that individual to come back and say you know what we destroyed your life and your career and at the end of the day you were right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s I mean that you&#x27;re talking depending on how many people that&#x27;s ever happened to if it&#x27;s happened then that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a hell of a liability that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one hell of a lawsuit yeah now um yeah at this point I&#x27;m sure everybody&#x27;s familiar that uh you know you have been working with Danny shean uh the Pentagon I I guess I can say the Pentagon or the public uh spokesperson has you know they put out some statements um you know saying you you didn&#x27;t direct a tip or you know whatever whatever whatever they&#x27;ve been saying which we know is not true um have are do you think there&#x27;s any other countermeasures that would ever be taken and other than trying to delete your emails or at least claiming that they did well sure I mean obviously that the fact you&#x27;re seeing it play out the fact that they tried to come after my security clearances and make false accusations the fact that they&#x27;re trying to rewrite history uh after uh the The Dana White the Secretary of defense&#x27;s own uh press secretary stated what ATP was and what my role was in it you know now you see this this amateur effort to to try to change course uh and then you know last but not least delete my emails um that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s problematic you know that&#x27;s that frankly now on the verge of any legal act um but I don&#x27;t think I have to help them anymore paint themselves in a corner um I I my intent was always to offer a helping hand and help them out of this corner uh and for whatever reason every time I extend my hand they they recoil and back themselves further into the corner um it&#x27;s a bit like a it&#x27;s a bit like a like a an angry hungry dog that has been um um no matter how much you try to to to help it and feed it and pet it um it just wants to bite and uh that is not uh indicative of the entire Department of Defense I want to make this clear that uh the Department of Defense does an amazing job 99% of the time and is full of absolute Patriots some of my very best friends uh are are are still members of of the Department of Defense and the Pentagon um the problem is that there are some elements you know the same elements uh that people consider are running Rogue uh regarding the UAP topic there are some Rogue elements in the Pentagon that have decided to to make this an agenda for them and unfortunately they&#x27;ve dragged the rest of the Pentagon into into their pettiness and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s at this point it&#x27;s looking absolutely ridiculous uh for the Pentagon and I don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t need my help right now looking any more ridiculous it actually makes me very sad I I I wish there was a way that we could simply just has them stop digging themselves at any deeper holes um they&#x27;ve already got a hell of a ladder that they&#x27;re going to have to climb to get out of it and ultimately it disparages the the the the fine men and women in uniform that work in our national security you know my intent I don&#x27;t want to embarrass anybody look I don&#x27;t even want an apology at this point you know I don&#x27;t give a about that but it cares about them being forthcoming and telling the truth to the American people and again unfortunately there&#x27;s some folks that that have taken this personally me breaking rank with the pen Pentagon has has has infuriated them and and as a result of that they&#x27;ve dragged through the mud the Pentagon with them and I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a travesty</p>
