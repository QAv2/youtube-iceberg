            <p>all right hello and welcome to my channel this channel is for educational purposes and we try to shed light on uh important theories of everything all-encompassing theories uh difficult esoteric and obscure theories that could benefit your life if you knew about them but you don&#x27;t because they&#x27;ve been suppressed and uh today is our 300 49th video on the reciprocal system of theory from Dy B Larson and uh this theory is from the 20th century Mr Larson lived from 1898 until 1990 and about 1930 uh he was uh I think waiting at a stoplight and about to go across the street and he had this uh Epiphany about uh uh a a chemistry problem that he is working on um having to do with the interatomic distance and uh it had to do with uh making a few assumptions and they kind of worked out and um then later he was working on a different problem and he said why don&#x27;t I try applying that same principle to this this one and he got the right answer again and he applied it a few more times and said maybe I have some kind of uh Universal um understanding here uh a key to uh solving things and so he spent the next 30 Years really developing his ideas and in the late 1950s he put out his two fundamental postulates and um and from those postulates he then derived uh what you would call a theoretical universe so from those postulates he deduced uh universe as to how um how his Universe would look if his postulates were correct what would the results be and then in his uh in his books he basically compared his findings to the findings of um the Legacy scientist you know what was their what did their Universe look like compared to what did his his look like and in most cases his Universe looked the same as the uh kind of the Newtonian universe but in those relativistic areas areas of the very small the very large and the very fast um the Newtonian system did not agree with Larson system in the same way that it didn&#x27;t agree with uh you know some of the new findings that were coming out um that had come out in the late 19th early 20th century that caused uh Einstein to propose his theories of Relativity and so on so um now um so Larson wrote a bunch of books and many many articles gave a lot of talks and founded a uh a journal and uh had had a small following and uh eventually he died in 1990 uh after that um some of his small group of followers have carried on and attempted to extend his work and uh revise it in a certain way um some more were more Orthodox than others but um the two that I tend to focus on are Dr kvk neru and Dr Bruce peret who came up with this thing called rs2 and they um I believe were in the spirit of Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system but they also um were able to kind of pick out areas where Larson made mistakes and Larson admitted that he was uh you know subject to making mistakes he believ the theory itself was correct but whether he applied it correctly every time was another question and if he didn&#x27;t eventually it would become clear that he didn&#x27;t and so that&#x27;s what they focused on and they corrected certain things or at least made revisions and certain things one of the things that Dr pet uh changed up is of the actual fundamental postulates of the reciprocal system and so I would like to uh this time uh read uh Dr Pet&#x27;s uh fundamental postes they two fundamental postulates and then unpack them a little bit and then go into uh an a new article that he wrote um not new but one that we haven&#x27;t uh heard we&#x27;ve been going through his articles that are entitled rs211 rs212 rs2 103 and uh today we&#x27;re looking at rs2 105 um it goes up to 109 um so we&#x27;re going to go through all of those eventually but today we&#x27;re looking at 105 but uh we&#x27;re going to backtrack just a little bit and go through his fundamental postulates unpack them and then uh get into his um 105 okay the First Fundamental postulate out of two the first one is by far more important but um and also I must I must also add that by uh using Larson uh by using Pet&#x27;s two fundamental postulates it uh gets rid of the need for uh the metaphysical postulates of Larson Larson had two fundamental postulates for the physical universe but then when he started applying those po those postulates to metaphysical aspects or uh things like life and um intelligence um and ethics those two postulates did not hold up and he had to drive for other postulates uh to Encompass the metaphysical realm like the nonphysical uh beyond the Physical Realm and so but when pet uh does his two fundamental postulates he no longer needs those four metaphysical pulas because they fit into this uh other structure that he constructed just by dropping a couple words and adding a couple more okay so the first postulate the universe is composed of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and then the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of or ordinary mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is projective so that&#x27;s it those are the two fundamental postulates in dwey larsson&#x27;s Universe the universe is not made out of uh matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy it&#x27;s not composed of fundamental forces it is made out of motion and if I were correcting pet I would also add scalar motion universe is composed of one component scalar motion um which is a uh overlooked uh kind of um overlooked um variety of motion um most motion we think of as velocity uh um it has a uh a magnitude and a direction scalar motion is a motion with no Direction um which you envision using a balloon with dots on it you take the balloon and you blow it up all of the dots are moving away from each other uh but they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction each dot is moving away from each other Dot and in fact even the the point even the areas or locations between the dots are also moving away from other areas or locations um between the dots as well all points on that balloon um are moving away from all other points and the farther away they are the faster they are moving away from each other that is a scalar motion that is a motion that has a magnitude but has no Direction and um that is the kind of motion that even though the scientists know about that kind of motion and even though they have observed that kind of motion in the distant galaxies all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other they&#x27;ve kind of relegated that kind of motion to a sideshow that it&#x27;s not really that important to know about this um which usually is a pretty good indication that it is a good re uh there is a good reason to know about it uh but uh so so we&#x27;ve got this scalar motion that Larson has put as fundamental and as Central to his narrative as opposed to the Legacy scientists and this motion comes in three dimensions and um in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time so first we&#x27;ll say uh the universe is composed of one component motion scalar motion and um motion for Larson is the relationship between space and time and I might add that motion is also the relationship between time and space so it could be either MO motion is you know space over time that&#x27;s speed but it Al is also time over space which is energy but uh both space and time and therefore motion also come in three dimensions so you can have relations such as time over space squared um which is force or space over time squared which is acceleration or time the third power over space to the thir power which is matter and any other permutations or combinations uh thereof and um you can even get into higher numbers than that if you are using like some uh use something like volume so like density density is T to the 3 power or s to the 6th power because density is mass over volume so density is T 3r over s the 3r over s the 3 or t 3 over s 6 okay so space and time both have three dimensions Larson calls that coordinate time and coordinate space we are familiar with coordinate space XYZ coordinates we&#x27;re not as familiar with the concept of three-dimensional time but as a a reciprocal by definition two reciprocals have the same qualities so if three dimensions adheres to space it also adheres to time and conversely uh what we know about time is that time is always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction C so time is we see time as being kind of the scalar motion a motion that doesn&#x27;t have a direction and uh space therefore also has that quality um space is getting farther and farther and farther apart and we see that in the um recession of the distant galaxies we also see that in the uh balloon with dots on it expanding and then uh time also is a time and space uh also come in discrete units meaning that there&#x27;s a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you ain&#x27;t got space and if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time you ain&#x27;t got time you have to have a full full unit and if you have one full unit of space in one full unit of time you have what Larson calls unit speed or the speed of light so the speed of light is really the unit of this universe of motion it is the background it is the origin it is the zero point uh the state of rest um which makes sense that in a universe of motion even the state of rest is moving it&#x27;s moving constantly outward at the speed of light in all directions okay so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s taking a look at the first postulate the second postulate the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathem or ordinary mathematics he got rid of the commutative part which Larsson had put in there um and its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is projective in Larson system the geometry was ukian and that prevented um a lot of the usages of um life phenomena mental phenomena that is eliminated when you use projective geometry or the Cascade um uh ukian geometry is a subset of projective geometry and pet looks at a geometrical Cascade it goes from projective geometry to a fine geometry which is where the life phenomena comes from projective is more like this scalar motion level this all-encompassing Universal level and then a fine geometry is is life a phenomena metric geometry and then ukian geometry so ukian geometry is just a particular kind of um projective geometry okay now let&#x27;s get started with this uh this paper here that pet did on um RS 2105 it&#x27;s called Quantum pi and I have to admit that this paper has me a little bit baffled but I understand the basic idea um and I think it&#x27;s an important concept but I I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s totally fundamental to a Theory but we&#x27;re going to we&#x27;re going to look at all of them so we&#x27;re going to look at this one Quantum Pi uh researcher miles matys wrote a couple of interesting papers concerning the mathematical constant Pi what is pi is one of them and the other one is the extinction of Pi where he causes considerable controversy with his conclusions that Pi is an acceleration and has a value of 4.0 not the conventional 3.14159265 this raises an interesting point in the reciprocal system because the reciprocal system is based on discrete units of scalar motion analogous to quanta in conventional science as you shrink a circle in diameter eventually you will reach the point where the discrete boundary is reached okay as you shrink a circle in diameter eventually you will reach the point where a discrete boundary is reached and you end up with a square instead of a circle okay I&#x27;m guessing that he&#x27;s talking about the discrete boundary of the discrete unit postulate uh that uh time and space come in and motion scalar motion come in only discrete units and once you get inside that smallest unit you end up with a square instead of a circle a unit square has a diameter of one unit and a perimeter or circumference of four units making the value of pi to be four just as ma indicated in his papers as Pi is the relationship between the circumference or diameter and the radius or uh actually circumference or perimeter and the diameter sorry so Pi is the relationship between the circumference and the diameter but if the diameter is a perimeter of a square then that number actually goes to four upon further investigation into the value of pi it was found that the answer in the reciprocal system is all of the above with the caveat that the value of pi is reference system dependent so he&#x27;s saying that uh depending on the reference system that you&#x27;re choosing uh that changes the value of pi and it can be four uh it can also be 3.1415926 and [Music] um I would add that you know the choice of reference system is is fundamentally important in the reciprocal system and with scalar motion now if you go back to your balloon expanding balloon with dots on it the uh the motion is scalar because it has no specific Direction all of the dots are all the locations are moving away from each other but this is only until you choose a reference point if you arbitrarily decide that one of the dots is motionless then all of a sudden you have directions between all of the other dots you can identify the directions that are involved by making the assumption that one of these is motion list or by uh saying the same thing in a different way by choosing a reference point so when you choose the reference system then all of a sudden you have directions all of a sudden you have um you know if you were kind of going inward if the balloon were going inward instead of out W you would have what what is called force fields um okay so so in Larson system the reciprocal system ref the reference system is very important okay as mentioned in the paper on scalar motion the units of motion are counting numbers with a minimum quantity of one consecutive units therefore appear as links in a chain solid bits of metal that can only Flex at their boundaries lson during his discussion on Direction reversals states that the only time you can change scalar directions is at the unit boundary where the links of the chain can bend this is radically different from from the Continuum approach of conventional science where there are no discrete units and the structure is more like a piece of tape able to bend at any location okay so you&#x27;re using that chain link idea the only place that you can bend a chain is at the you know if the if the links of the chain if there are 50 lengths of a chain you know you can&#x27;t bend it at any point you only can bend it at those 50 intersections where it&#x27;s between one chain and another whereas if you had a piece of tape you could bend it at any point along the way so the discrete unit postulate means that you only can um make those kind of transitions at certain points in between the discrete units okay uh this uh section is called pixelation squaring the circle in our conventional ukian frame of reference there are three orthogonal axes that we divide by fixed distance intervals in the case of the reciprocal system those intervals are fixed at one natural unit of space or time if we&#x27;re talking about the cosmic sector which we didn&#x27;t get into this video but if you&#x27;ve watched my videos before you may know what the cosmic sector is so to use an old computer Graphics term our ukian reality is pixelated in a fashion similar to what computers draw on a monitor a bunch of little boxes not a smooth structure pixels have gotten really small these days but if you take a magnifying glass to your monitor you will see that it is composed of a bunch of dots of color and that a diagonal line usually looks like a staircase it is not smooth the same happens with curves they are approximated because the monitor is made of tiny illuminated squares I also kind of think in this in uh in the same vein as what he&#x27;s talking about here maybe with time instead of space is just the concept of a cartoon you know um we have a certain resolving power that we can&#x27;t really go beyond um and and if you&#x27;re you know if you look at cartoons it&#x27;s a bunch of still photos or still pictures that are um viewed in Rapid succession so rapidly that you see a continuous movement but if you break it down or if you slowed it down you would see that you&#x27;re you&#x27;re dealing with a bunch of discret pictures that are all just slightly different and that um but when put together rapidly you see it as a continuous movement uh it&#x27;s the same concept here with the chain and the same concept with the pixelation um you see a diagonal line but if you if you put it under a microscope or something if you expand your vision uh then you you see that it&#x27;s pixelated that it&#x27;s a bunch of individual dots that are illumin ated that do not make a diagonal they make more of what you would call a stair a stair step or you know that there it isn&#x27;t a smooth you know isn&#x27;t a smooth curve it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bunch of um gradations so I think it&#x27;s the same concept here and uh uh Dr pet is going to expand it expand it as we move uh further into this p paper but we are going to stop there right now um I would have to imagine that it&#x27;s going to take us a few days to get through this paper because we&#x27;re going to go pretty slowly um to make sure first to make sure that I understand it and then um hopefully you will be able to understand it also um if we move through this rather slowly and um you know just kind of um go step by step uh pet tends to write um he he skips uh sometimes he skip steps and sometimes he&#x27;ll leave you behind uh because I think he is uh he was a you know pretty much of a um scientist and so if you&#x27;re not a a scientist you might have to go through this a little bit more slowly like me so I hope that I I don&#x27;t uh go too slowly for you but uh if you if I do I guess you can just fast forward me um okay so uh thanks for tuning in today we&#x27;ll uh start up again tomorrow uh leaving off where we started here or starting where we left off actually and uh thanks for tuning in have a great</p>
