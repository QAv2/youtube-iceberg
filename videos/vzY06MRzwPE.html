            <p>a lot of people are doing nothing more than getting huge quantities of mass and see if they can get a gravity wave to cause things to move well that isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;re talking about at all so i wondered if gravity could be related to its cousin magnetism and so i uh i found that when i take two magnets together i have some neodymiums around here that i&#x27;m actually afraid of they they&#x27;re saying they can danger you but anyhow you take a magnet you go they put them together and go and they go clunk right but you take one of them move it around and all of a sudden that one doesn&#x27;t want to go right the repulsive so i got i had i ordered one at five thousand dollars a piece with with a quarter inch hole through between both of them and i put a brass bolt and i tighten them down forcing them together and then i put them together in a thing that looks kind of like a rock okay and then i got another one that didn&#x27;t have magnets in it and uh galileo in in all his endeavors he went up to the lean tower pisa and dropped the and he dropped a big rock and a small rock and his buddy down the bottom kept telling him that the large rock and small rock arrived at the same time well i went up to in the lockheed building 501 by the side of escalators and and elbows wow and i got i got uh i got i got uh nine guys that were not educated and didn&#x27;t have pre-didn&#x27;t have pre-opinions on anything and i dropped my two rocks and i said what i would like you to do is i told them what i&#x27;d like you to do is i would like you to take whichever one arrives first get it in your hand and when i come down the elevator hand it to me now they looked identical except for so and nobody knew what was inside absolutely not all the nine times that i tested it it&#x27;s as though the one with the opposing magnet field extending out three feet on each side i actually measured how big the field is how big the field was and on each side of a rod of one rock i had a total of six feet at any rate the other the other rockaway first which one right first the one the one that had no magnetic field in it so you&#x27;re able to cancel out gravity to a certain degree you want to cancel precisely reduce the mass gravity effect precisely by opposing fields isn&#x27;t that nice you bet and got nine signatures and wouldn&#x27;t i at least eight years ago this is um the actual document of boyd&#x27;s where he proved that by altering the the field in a falling body the magnetic field it reduced its mass gravity equivalent and cancelled out the effects of gravity to a certain percentage and he did a 500 a building 500 drop test conducted from a height of 59 feet the location is in white solomon texas and the time was 12 20 p.m and this was in 1995 december 12th nobody knows this i know it so gravity mass gravity is not um well you can alter it well gravity gravity within itself has to have gravity goes through anything that is solid and anything like iron or anything else but i it&#x27;s but it has to have a magnetic component which may be canceling out within itself but as soon as it got around my rock it all of a sudden recognize the presence but somebody one of einstein&#x27;s students tried to merge electromagnetism and gravity and he rejected it but he didn&#x27;t have an experiment like you know i understand yeah yeah i know that but somebody one of my students tried to emerge electromagnetism and gravity and he rejected it but he didn&#x27;t have an experiment like you know i understand i i know that but somebody one of my students tried to emerge electromagnetism and gravity and he rejected it but he didn&#x27;t have an experiment like you know i understand i know that but somebody one of my students tried to merge electromagnetism and gravity and he rejected it but he didn&#x27;t have an experiment like you know i understand i know that but but see we you nature never uses english it doesn&#x27;t speak it doesn&#x27;t speak any language but yet it&#x27;s talking to us all the time right and the key thing is is to identify identify what it&#x27;s saying with the meager information that has been accumulated over a period of years astronomers cannot draw too many definite conclusions about mars we realize there are probably certain unavoidable errors in our calculations any one of which could make a big difference as to whether or not there is life as we know it on mars for the past half century the intriguing possibility of traveling to mars in a spaceship has challenged the imagination of many men rocket ships of all sizes and shapes have been designed but most of them rely on an enormous consumption of chemical fuel to escape the pull of the earth&#x27;s gravity a spaceship using an electromagnetic drive to neutralize gravity is the obvious answer a spaceship using an electromagnetic drive to neutralize gravity is the obvious answer a spaceship using an electromagnetic drive to utilize gravity is the obvious answer a spaceship using an electromagnetic drive to utilize gravity is the obvious answer but such a device is still a dream for the future how would you define gravity could you describe in layman&#x27;s terms its basic principles for us gravity is something difficult to explain because it&#x27;s something that we essentially don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s just something that we can observe not much is really known about gravity uh there are many theories about it but they are just mainly theories there&#x27;s theories of gravitons which allege that there these are these subatomic particles that act like an attractive force like gravity that exchange between two pieces of matter there is also a theory that gravity is a form of wave an electromagnetic wave gravity is a form of wave electromagnetic wave gravity is a form of wavelength wave gravity is a form of wavelength wave but basically gravity is a force it&#x27;s uh it wants the inherent property of matter to have gravity a mutual attraction for each other dean davis with united press international could you please address uh the vehicle that there was a drawing displayed of why would this vehicle be on display at an air show what is the power source that you are asserting is going to be uh so very useful and how can you determine this vehicle is not something that is being developed you know by a government agency uh in fact i think that was the testimony this is an alien reproduction vehicle and just to be clear this means that it is a based on advanced anti-gravity and zero-point energy propulsion systems they are being manufactured by a consortium of companies that include lockheed martin northrop saic and other corporations but this is not a jet internal combustion system at all it is actually kicked in by a type of electric power source and it then accesses this ambient zero point energy field that is responsible for all matter and energy existing and uh by special configurations and and what have you it causes a a cancellation of mass inertia and an anti-gravity effect the white background represents the dark energy field the pulsing represents the electromagnetic distortion around all matter like two atoms the electromagnetic distortion pushes dark energy away from matter on a gradient and makes all matter appear to have an attraction towards itself gravity can be defined as the electromagnetic force that matter exerts on the universe on dark energy that causes a dark energy field effect or gravity gravity can be defined as electromagnetic force that matter inserts all universe on dark energy that causes a dark energy field effects or gravity gravity defined as the electromagnetic force that matter exerts on the universe on dark energy that causes a dark energy field effect or gravity gravity can be defined as the electromagnetic force that matter inserts one universe on dark energy that causes a dark energy field effects or gravity you can scale this up from atoms all the way to planets and suns and even black holes anything that creates gravity is actually not pulling things into itself like a gravity well more it is pushing dark energy away and in doing so dark energy is pushing harder on the side with the least distortion as the fields touch each other it creates a path of least resistance and the two objects are forced together by the stronger dark energy field on the side with less distortion giving matter and attraction towards itself it&#x27;s dark energy that causes an attraction of matter towards itself that creates gravity modern science current science right now identifies one gravity it&#x27;s one force in nature uh apparently through research at s4 or information gained from one of the crafts they were researching there it appears that there are two different forms of gravity one form works on an atomic scale on subatomic particles holding pieces of matter holding atoms themselves together another works on a larger scale the scale we&#x27;re most familiar with holding planets in orbit holding ourselves to the ground things of that sort because it produces a gravitational field i i wouldn&#x27;t say the craft is invisible during the day however if you&#x27;re under the craft because of the way the gravity is being used gravity bends time and space and it bends light if you are looking underneath the craft or from certain vantage points you will actually see what&#x27;s above the craft it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s really a trick of the way light bends under the influence of gravity for instance we can see stars that are behind the sun that are blocked from our view by the sun the reason we can see them is because the sun is a tremendous gravitational field and it&#x27;s bending the light around it where we can see the star space time and gravity are all essentially interrelated they all act on one another gravity bends space gravity also distorts time when you vary one you essentially vary the other two if you as an example if you have a massive body say a planet or something that&#x27;s making a lot of gravity producing a lot of gravitational waves if you will um it distorts space it bends space to it it also slows down time these things aren&#x27;t theories we know them to be true they had an easel next to it with a drawing a cutaway drawing that uh that showed some of the internal components how they were arranged was oriented to one another and then they had a little uh a tv monitor with uh you know a tape player below it that was showing this continuous loop of this thing um you know sitting you know or hovering over a dry lake bed out the desert somewhere and and as as you would watch the tape this thing would make uh from went from a hovering position made these three little sort of hops going to the side and then as the camera followed it just went straight up it disappeared outside he was beautiful down to nothing in just a matter of a second half or so one of the things that this general had said during the presentation one of the things that really stood out in brad&#x27;s mind was that he said that these vehicles were capable of light speed or better so according to his account on november 12 1988 mark&#x27;s friend inadvertently gained access to a highly classified air show where the featured hardware of the event was real flying sources they were really strange looking but appeared functional and were named to suggest anti-gravity and reverse-engineered alien technology an official presence stated they could travel faster than light despite their futuristic performance capabilities these appeared to be stripped down road-worn working prototypes which had seen practical operation for years if this were the case they were crude but tangible proof of concept for a staggering leap in aviation technology they used extremely advanced electromagnetic or field propulsion electromagnetic or field propulsion electromagnetic or field propulsion electromagnetic or field propulsion as opposed to solid or jet fuel nuclear power or any other commonly known conventional means it also meant our government and at least one other major defense contractor lockheed martin had been developing and deploying functional systems along these lines for many years and he just sat down and right where is sitting there at his table he just kind of sketched out in a with a with an ink pad on a piece of legal size white paper and put some you know some little handwritten call outs around the edges that described you know the the number of capacitor plates in each one of the little sections that there were you know they were so wide at the end and the crew compartment was definitely about 12 feet in diameter just kind of put all these things down as close as he could remember to the way they existed this was called the flux liner this is probably the strangest one you&#x27;ve shown me yet this actually flies it actually flies on the principles of high voltage electrical charges alicia davis described being escorted into the engine room seeing the propulsion system components and it involved a central column that was made of a transparent glass-like material she said there was a silvery fluid that was spiraling upward in this at the bottom of this column down in kind of this well that was in the center of the spacecraft was this little tiny flywheel-like mechanism spinning which matched the arv also and this is at a point when this young lady had never seen any of the drawings that i&#x27;ve done what the arv was structured like i was just you know talking about propulsion in general but then she said that when you looked across this little well in this three lowered floor area in the center of the room there&#x27;s like a garden rail around it she stood there she could look across and she said it looked like the below the deck she was standing on was this glass-like material with these coils of wire going through and they were spaced out in the same proportions as the ones on the urb the thing that she said that was most significant was that the column itself was rotating in one direction and the flywheel was opposite spinning in the opposite direction it was counter rotation which is something that&#x27;s often been reported in ufo sight if you see components on the ground that are spinning in opposite directions back here on earth the scientific community has been busy since the end of the industrial revolution there have been dozens perhaps hundreds of u.s and international patents dealing directly with electrokinetics and electrogravitix going back to the turn of the last century it would be safe to assume private industry and the military have also been working on a great deal of related applications off the public record in short since nikola tesla&#x27;s first experiments with pushing electricity around mankind has had a thing for anti-gravity [Music] do [Music] you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s i find it really remarkable that there&#x27;s so much similarity between the two objects and when that when is that patent from uh may 30 1967 it&#x27;s called a magneto hydrodynamic propulsion apparatus and so i started thinking well maybe it&#x27;s like a cyclotron maybe there&#x27;s an electrical discharge from this basically this this whole thing looks like a giant tesla it&#x27;s got the capacitor array it&#x27;s got you know a central column that looks like the secondary windings of the tesla coil and this might even go back to something that nikola tesla discovered back in the 1940s you know just was all hushed up and all the ufo sightings we&#x27;ve ever seen were something that came from nikola tesla not from another planet the arv system for all of its claims of flashy out of this world propulsion capabilities was indeed remarkably simple it could be described as a large-scale souped-up tesla coil designed to negate gravity and inertia with off-the-shelf navigation and life support systems bolted on almost as an afterthought you could think of it as the model t of anti-gravity vehicles an industrial dune buggy or crude hot rod that can get you to mars in a few minutes in this version at least first class seating was still a way off there&#x27;s a large capacitor array through the middle of the crew compartment is a central column that&#x27;s called the amplifier section that&#x27;s in the middle of the craft on the very center point of that column is what looks like a large nine foot diameter flywheel type mechanism then around the belt line of the crew compartment is a about a two foot wide coil of wire that&#x27;s embedded in the same glass-like material that the capacitor section completes are embedded in the ejection seats are mounted back to back there&#x27;s four of them in the smallest version of the craft and they&#x27;re mounted on this central column on a set of rails a bowl that that moves around and can be you know used to convey the the commands of the pilot in terms of what he wants to do in terms of shaping the field around the vehicle and right in the center of that bowl is a kind of a laser diode this aircraft was using extremely high voltages and the voltages would ionize the air around the vehicle so much that it would start producing x-ray photons which are absolutely lethal so you have to have basically a barrier to protect yourself with a little uh air-driven claw that&#x27;s on the end of it in fact i think that the craft&#x27;s magnetic field or electromagnetic field is probably so powerful that conventional little electric motors probably wouldn&#x27;t work the electrostatic field created by this huge capacitor array and the ionization that occurs just because the propulsion system might be enough to create a level of ionization around the craft that&#x27;s high enough that it would produce x-ray photons of its own accord and so you would want to be able to protect the the pilot and the the crew members from that radiation so anyway that&#x27;s the the general overview of the the structure of the vehicle this is a vehicle that has the ability to travel up to or beyond the speed of light part of the reason that it&#x27;s able to do that is because it exploits the energy form that&#x27;s embedded in space time that&#x27;s responsible for the effects of mass and inertia so here we have a configuration of various components creating a system that&#x27;s somehow capable of producing and maintaining an insane amount of energy in a concentrated field around the vehicle this field can be precisely controlled by the pilot with the aid of a basic throttle an alien steering ball and a bunch of casino cameras there&#x27;s plenty of on-board oxygen handy if you&#x27;re off the planet and a lead coating so the occupants don&#x27;t get fried in their seats and a robot arm in case you need a robot arm somewhere it looks like a big clumsy diving bell from 1905 but apparently works like a helicopter you can take past light speed its beauty and elegance lie in the propulsion system maybe a really really fast one that gets around currently accepted physics one we commonly associate with ufos for anybody who has followed the work of einstein or just basic physics you know one of the sort of you know inviolable rules of physics is that there&#x27;s no material object that can actually go fast from speed of light so somehow or other and i&#x27;m not saying we got this from aliens but they did call it the alien reproduction vehicle but somehow or other this simple system that brad described in these diagrams was able to do this in the middle of last century physicists made an astounding discovery and that is what we ordinarily consider empty space isn&#x27;t empty at all even if you go to the far reaches of outer space it turns out that rather than emptiness what we call the vacuum is really a seething cauldron of what we call quantum energy or zero point energy zero point just simply means that even if you froze the entire universe down to absolute zero froze out all motion where everything would be as quiet as you could possibly get it this energy is still there it was predicted by the mathematics of quantum theory but the numbers were so large for example there&#x27;s enough energy in the vine of a coffee cup to evaporate the world&#x27;s oceans it was thought well this must be some kind of artifact in the theory but as time went on various predictions in quantum theory were verified in the laboratory and it finally turned out we had to take these numbers seriously so in a sense if you find the right way to do it you can actually sort of reduce the mass of an object and if you can do that then of course it takes less propulsive force to push it around it means that it can go a lot faster because it&#x27;s not limited by the amount of mass that it increases to as it accelerates in fact it may in fact be a situation where the faster you go the more energy you have available to continue and continue the acceleration process and at the same time the mass is becoming relatively less and less and less so it really it really enables the possibility of being able to go faster in speed of light without violating general relativity and that was the most fascinating aspect of the whole thing by using the flux in the vacuum of spacetime as a power source for your propulsion system so literally the faster you go the more energy you have available that you convert into propulsive force and the the lower the relative mass of the vehicle becomes so it&#x27;s actually sort of an inversely proportional kind of a relationship most scientists with an instant response would think on special relativity terms and say well the velocity of light is the limitation you can&#x27;t go fast in the speed of light and therefore to conceive of us exploring stars or other people coming here it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s too far they they just can&#x27;t get from here to there um we might explore our own solar system but that&#x27;s probably as far as we&#x27;re going to get but the truth of the matter is that in general relativity that&#x27;s not not the case there are options there that limitation now has begun to evaporate due to the new understandings and predictions coming out of general relativity so that&#x27;s not the issue there&#x27;s obviously an electromagnetic field that was forming around this ring of wire that ran around the crew compartment and that would form a kind of uh donut shaped or toroid shaped electromagnetic field with field lines stroking right through the middle of craft which happened to be where there was this large central column now the central column was supposed to be the most secret part of the vehicle brad didn&#x27;t seem to know too much about that but he said that he used mercury in some form he thought it might use it as a noble gas vaporized mercury the the mercury based on a number of accounts appears to circulate in a kind of a closed loop system that runs down through the cylinder in the middle and then back up in the space between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder and there&#x27;s a counter rotation kind of a mechanism that&#x27;s occurring there too and at the midpoint is this thing that looks like a flywheel but in effect what i think it&#x27;s actually it&#x27;s it&#x27;s actual function is similar to what&#x27;s called a homopolar generator where you can use the centrifugal forces of a disc conducting metal discs that&#x27;s spinning to actually throw the electrons in the material out to the edge where they can be literally tapped off with something that looks like a a brush that has conductive bristles now i believe that what happens is that this vehicle develops probably several million volts of voltage and the the shear power of the electrostatic field that is created in this capacitor ray actually has the ability to polarize uh the surrounding space time um and it polarizes the the so-called zero point energy that is embedded in the space time so it creates kind of a positive and a negative aspect to the the status of that zero point energy that&#x27;s surrounding the vehicle so just to kind of give a little background the idea of a space warp works on the principle of expanding and contracting space in such a way that allows you to go somewhere very very quickly what this does is it leads to something that was described by michaela kuvieri in his 1994 paper on warp drive the creation of a warp drive that would not violate general relativity and one of the things that he was suggesting was that you would be able to um engineer a vector or a pair of vectors in space time that would on the one hand cause a compression of space time ahead of the vehicle and an expansion of space time behind the vehicle and that there would be an intervening space between those two phenomenon that would pretty much peg your sense of gravity your sense of inertia to the environment that you departed from when you initiated this this movement so in essence what you have is you have a spherical event horizon around this particular region that might be called a dynamically engineered local spacetime and this particular region is set up in such a way that it creates these uh influences in the surrounding metric in such a way that it also creates a vector that goes in this direction and so it&#x27;s kind of like having it&#x27;s almost like having a black hole ahead of you and an expansion of space-time behind you but the the actual environmental conditions that you experience inside the spacecraft are pretty much pegged to the time and place that you start out from so you don&#x27;t have any sense of g-forces or or being moved around you don&#x27;t have any uh sense of acceleration because the entire pocket of space-time that you&#x27;re encapsulated in is being accelerated by the vectors that are created around the system so it&#x27;s uniformly accelerated the space-time pocket that you&#x27;ve created the uh the vehicle itself the the crew the cargo everything is moved as one complete package and so there&#x27;s no sense of acceleration but what it allows for according to kubiari&#x27;s calculations is what he was calling a an arbitrarily large speed which would suggest something in excess of the speed of light at super luminal speeds so to the person that&#x27;s inside the vehicle it may appear that you you know you begin to accelerate for accelerate away from a a particular location but to the person who&#x27;s standing outside the disturbed region of space time it looks as though you just were gone just you know in an instant so this is an arv isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s called that&#x27;s what some people call it we we call it ram replication alien machine oh i see once we retrieved back in the 30s and 40s and 50s several of these extraterrestrial vehicles and began to study them we combined that knowledge with knowledge we already had because remember we had some people like t-towns and brown who were studying anti-gravity quite independent of this issue back in the 20s 30s and 40s but when their information got combined with studying these spacecraft they figured out ah this is how their work so they were modeling the universe as being sort of this this empty you know material free environment that had this energy that was embedded in it almost like like a uh a fluid in a way that it had all of this potential that you couldn&#x27;t see until you found a way of driving it out of this homogenous sort of state of equilibrium and getting to do usable work now what is zero point energy i&#x27;m going to show you a different many different definitions but let me quote nikola tesla in 1891 the world&#x27;s greatest electrical futurist nikola tesla stated quote throughout space there is energy is this energy static or kinetic if static our hopes are in vain if kinetic and we know for certain it is then it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheel work of nature many generations may pass but in time our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point in the universe and this is very important it means that we homo sapiens have the ability to access this so-called zero point field of energy which the is the ambient field of energy from which all matter and energy is fluxing and can access that energy and generate all the power we need to run this planet without fossil fuels or pollution the white background represents the dark energy field the pulsing represents the electromagnetic distortion around all matter like two atoms the electromagnetic distortion pushes dark energy away from matter on a gradient and makes all matter appear to have an attraction towards itself gravity can be defined as the electromagnetic force that matter exerts on the universe on dark energy that causes a dark energy field effect or gravity you can scale this up from atoms all the way to planets and suns and even black holes anything that creates gravity is actually not pulling things into itself like a gravity well more it is pushing dark energy away and in doing so dark energy is pushing harder on the side with the least distortion as the fields touch each other it creates a path of least resistance and the two objects are forced together by the stronger dark energy field on the side with less distortion giving matter and attraction towards itself it&#x27;s dark energy that causes an attraction of matter towards itself that creates gravity</p>
