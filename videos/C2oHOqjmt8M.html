            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s upers? Patrick here [music] with Vetted. Today we&#x27;re talking about this. A a very small subset of these individuals had claimed to have interactions with UFOs [music] and I just I my my brain exploded. I thought that I was already done with this issue. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s that like when the CIA walks into your office unannounced? [music] &gt;&gt; You think it&#x27;s a joke? Is there some imminent threat potentially [music] either from adversarial forces within this solar system or from outside the solar system? &gt;&gt; For them to be a threat, they&#x27;d have to need something that we have.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We have you. I&#x27;m offering you up. Here&#x27;s here&#x27;s Gary. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much. CBS News called me to try to get me to do an interview to do a debate with him.</p>
<p>This was just a [music] few weeks ago. And I said, &quot;Without a doubt, never. All right, veters, please hit that like button. That really helps out the videos. And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button, y&#x27;all.&quot; All right, Vers.</p>
<p>So, what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, it&#x27;s about Dr. Gary Nolan in a recent interview he just did with Blossom. Whoa. And to address the elephant in the room, yes, I have glasses now. Um, I have to see, you know, up close better because I just couldn&#x27;t see anything really up close and I look at my computer a lot when I&#x27;m filming.</p>
<p>So, anyway, some of these videos you&#x27;re going to see me wearing glasses. How do I look? Uh, let&#x27;s jump into this interview. But first, I got to keep the mics on, y&#x27;all. All right, veters. I have to talk to you guys about a brand new show that&#x27;s coming out.</p>
<p>All right, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s called The Pen Dragon Cycle: Rise of the Merlin. It&#x27;s available on Daily Wire Plus. Okay, it&#x27;s a seven-part series. Honestly, this show is amazing.</p>
<p>Very cinematic in scope. Okay, these like huge battles, you know, the period piece sort of all the authentic like wardrobes and sets and you know, it&#x27;s like shot on location. I think they shot across multiple different, you know, countries. It feels so real. Well, you really do feel immersed in this show.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I was kind of blown away by this. I was not expecting it. Um, it&#x27;s about Merlin, right? The wizard. And there&#x27;s just some great like effect shots and and real practical effects, too, which is really, really cool. Um, and it just looks amazing, right? Like, it looks like, oh man, okay, this is like this is a real show.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a seven-part series. It&#x27;s available on Daily Wire Plus right now. I&#x27;ll put a link in the description. Go check it out. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a really, really good show. All right. So, the first part of this interview with Dr. Gary Nolan that we&#x27;re going to um discuss is how he got involved in UAP study to [music] begin with.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like you to talk a little bit about how you got brought into the kind of community where you became a person who has access to materials and experiences that other people are are needing you to help explain &gt;&gt; the original analysis of uh the Otakama specimen which is owned by somebody in Barcelona and which I think frankly should be returned to Chile for proper burial. I&#x27;ve said this many times once I realized what it was. This guy who was a representative of the CIA and an aerospace company, two of them, came to my office unannounced and said, &quot;Hey, we have these we have these people that we&#x27;ve collected into what we call the weird bucket. civilian, diplomatic or military uh events had occurred, damage which had sort of filtered up the chain in the medical arena and then said, &quot;Well, we don&#x27;t know what this is.&quot; And they went over to somebody who was collating in intelligence, you know, uh group uh these things and said, &quot;Okay, we have enough of these things and they&#x27;re starting to look similar to each other.&quot; Um and uh so let&#x27;s figure out what&#x27;s going on because some of our diplomatic core or intelligence officers were um basically getting sick and coming down with pretty severe problems. And so you know literally they walked in my door uh through a bunch of MRIs or showed me MRIs and X-rays uh of the damage which was incontrovertible.</p>
<p>It was quite clear that if anybody had that kind of damage inside their body or inside their brain, white matter disease, they were in, you know, in trouble and they were at least correlated to these significant health uh effects. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s that like when the CIA walks into your office unannounced? &gt;&gt; You think it&#x27;s a joke? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, I literally looked around, you know, my my office is, you know, on the third floor and there&#x27;s like a there&#x27;s a bridge between two buildings just uh and I thought, okay, there&#x27;s a candid camera here somewhere. Um, what&#x27;s going on? This is a joke.</p>
<p>Because not only had they mentioned this, but then they also mentioned that some of these a very small subset of these individuals had claimed to have interactions with UFOs. And I just I my my brain exploded. I thought that I was already done with this issue. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re presenting you with a problem. We have scans, we have MRIs, we have, you know, uh, biomemed imaging of people&#x27;s brains that have damage that we cannot explain.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re kind of collecting them in this random bucket. And ops, a few of them are saying that they have also had interactions with UFOs. Got it. I mean, this is a crazy story, right? Uh, it&#x27;s a great origin story from Dr. Gary Nolan essentially.</p>
<p>But I love the question, what&#x27;s it like when the CIA, you know, walks into your office? Um, yeah, you got to question that a little bit, I guess, which is interesting because, you know, if you&#x27;re an American, you think you should be able to trust the CIA, but they have such a backstory of working against Americans, you know. Isn&#x27;t that such a weird thing that we wouldn&#x27;t even trust our own intelligence agencies, right? Coming to talk to us like, whoa, whoa, what&#x27;s your angle, right? Because it always seems like they have an angle, right? And God, they&#x27;re probably watching this and watching me. And that makes me nervous, too, to be honest with you. By the way, let me just say, first of all, I love the CIA. Okay? Love the CIA.</p>
<p>Got no problems. I don&#x27;t want any problems. Free speech. I don&#x27;t know what else to say here. Um but so they come to ask Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan to basically check out some people who, you know, have had some serious medical issues um related to some energy weapons potentially being used against them. But also some of these people have said they&#x27;ve had encounters with UAP, right? And was that the way to slide that in? Right. Kind of, you know, the cover story was well there&#x27;s, you know, something&#x27;s happened to him. Oh, by the way, some with UAP, but the real focus was UAP the whole time, right? And then again, you got to question why the CIA is coming to talk to you and can you really trust what they&#x27;re bringing you? And this isn&#x27;t the first time Dr. Gary Nolan has talked about this.</p>
<p>Um, in fact, there&#x27;s a great clip that got shared online recently of Dr. Gary Nolan in a documentary from Ron James filmmaker Ron James. Shout out, who&#x27;s also included in my new psionics documentary coming out later this year. um he did a film called Accidental Truth UFO Revelations and um he spoke with Dr. Gary Nolan about the same thing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So it was actually rather unexpected. Around 2012, I got a knock on my door in my office at [music] Stanford and there were these two gentlemen standing there outside from the CIA and a aeronautics corporation. They started talking about UFOs and they wanted my help. To be honest, at the time I thought it was a joke. [music] They had heard that my lab had made one of the deepest immune profiling devices in the world, the mass spectrometer.</p>
<p>With mass spectrometry, you essentially can analyze samples and figure out what atoms and what molecules are in that sample. Is this something we know or is this something unusual? What the CIA wanted from me was help in understanding the blood of people who had claimed that they had seen UFOs to help them understand what had happened to these people. But as I developed a relationship with these individuals [music] from the CIA, they started saying, &quot;Okay, well, we also have these materials that supposedly some of these craft had left behind. What would you do with them?&quot; And I just want to say there&#x27;s a new accidental truth coming out um later this year. I believe it&#x27;s called The Next Accidental Truth that Rahm James made a follow-up to that.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a great documentary. I highly recommend uh checking it out. So very very interesting origin story for sure. And then, you know, it really makes you wonder, you know, studying the side effects of people who interact with UAP. I think that&#x27;s a great angle to take, right? Scientifically, um, and see what happened to them, right? I mean, that that is definitely a great angle because you can talk about sightings all day long.</p>
<p>You can talk about whatever, right? things you saw, things you experienced. But when there&#x27;s hard physical scientific data to prove that an interaction you had with a UFO left, you know what I mean? Left you with marks, if you will. Um, that&#x27;s pretty nice, right? Now, not for the people that get the marks, of course. I&#x27;m just saying for evidence or proof to help us, you know, prove that there is a phenomena here on Earth, right? So, it&#x27;s interesting and to be fair to be very sympathetic um to some of these people, what they experience is kind of downright scary. If you look at MRIs or of people with multiple sclerosis, um, and we have I have somebody in my family, uh, who has it, you&#x27;ll see these sort of random pockets of of just white matter.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s called white matter disease in general, but dead tart scar tissue. Um, and so it looked like that, like areas of their brains had just been fried. &gt;&gt; What could do that? &gt;&gt; An energy weapon. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s an energy weapon? cuz we talk here a lot about energy like uh high vibrations. What is an energy weapon? What would that look like? &gt;&gt; You have one in your kitchen.</p>
<p>Your microwave uh oven is an energy weapon. &gt;&gt; I mean, can you imagine your brain is fried? I mean, what does that even mean? Like that&#x27;s not good, right? And you know, I&#x27;ve always said this, like, you know, we&#x27;re going to get to this question later in the video, like are aliens a threat? that&#x27;s always a, you know, something that&#x27;s brought up and everyone&#x27;s got different opinions on that. Um, and it just depends how you look at it, right? But it could be the sense that maybe they&#x27;re not a threat in the sense that, you know, they want something bad to happen to you, but just because they&#x27;re a brand new species and, you know, the threat is unmitigated, meaning like, you know, they don&#x27;t mean to hurt, but because we&#x27;ve never interacted with before or or their technology, it could just by default hurt us, right? Think of like cultures interacting way back in the day, centuries ago, right? Diseases, things they didn&#x27;t wasn&#x27;t intentional, just your body wasn&#x27;t ready for it, right? So that could be sort of the same scenario here. So it&#x27;s like, yeah, we aliens maybe aren&#x27;t a threat, right? in the sense that you would typically think what a threat is that they intentionally want to hurt you, but they may unintentionally hurt you just because again, we&#x27;re not used to their technology or their biological structures. They may have new diseases we just never heard of and could affect us and you know th those type of things.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s kind of like they&#x27;re a threat unintentionally just by default, right? And then you have to ask the bigger question. And we&#x27;ll get to that in a second. But first, let&#x27;s watch this clip. I &gt;&gt; I think one of the reasons why I&#x27;m a good scientist is uh being able to recognize data off the curve. Listening to students do a presentation of their work every, you know, couple of months and they kind of flash by.</p>
<p>They throw they show the data and then, you know, you see it and then and I wait a sec. Go back a few slides. What did that mean? Because if you&#x27;re a scientist, you can&#x27;t just use the data you like. And I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m going to use Mick West as an example. He&#x27;s very good at saying this element of it proves it&#x27;s a seagull, you know, and I I I&#x27;m, you know, I&#x27;m but excludes all of the other counter seagull observations that were done at the time.</p>
<p>And that kind of cherrypicking just isn&#x27;t allowed in real science. I mean, CBS News called me to try to get me to do an interview to do a debate with him. This was just a few weeks ago, and I said without a doubt, never because I&#x27;m never I because he does this all the time, and I don&#x27;t have the time to to dissect every one of the arguments. And science is not a popularity contest. I&#x27;m not going to sit in front of an audience um which is basically some form of a of a Jerry Springer show um to to argue with somebody who who doesn&#x27;t even understand the difference between data, evidence, and proof.</p>
<p>He dares to call himself a skeptic. No, his website is metabunk. He&#x27;s a debunker. He comes to the story ahead of time. And I I don&#x27;t want to pick on him, but he&#x27;s a type of person that serious people just need to ignore because like it&#x27;s like I I&#x27;m a scientist.</p>
<p>I was born a skeptic or I was trained to be a skeptic. I&#x27;m skeptic of my own ideas. &gt;&gt; So, look, let me just say that I&#x27;ve interviewed Mick West um a few times uh on Betted. He&#x27;s actually I did an interview with him for the Psionics documentary. Then there&#x27;s a part of that in the documentary.</p>
<p>I personally have zero problems with MC West. has always been a very nice, respectable, professional person. Now, I understand Gary&#x27;s point of view. He&#x27;s a scientist. He&#x27;s on a He&#x27;s looking at it from a different angle than me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not a scientist, so why would I approach it like a scientist? I wouldn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, right? So, I get it. He&#x27;s just taking the ingredients. Think of it like cooking. He&#x27;s taking the ingredients and approaching it in his specialty. So, and it&#x27;s a personal thing, right, to not want to debate MC West.</p>
<p>Like, debates are weird anyway, to be honest with you. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s about proving what&#x27;s right or wrong. It really is just about like gotcha moment, getting the better of the person and this and that. So, but they can also be helpful in some ways, you know. Um, think about all the Christopher Hitchens debates I used to watch.</p>
<p>Shout shout out all you uh Hitchers um fans. Um, but you know, again, I I can understand his viewpoint. Do a lot of us wish that would happen? Yeah, I think it would be kind of cool, but it is a personal decision and I get him not wanting to do it. Um, and he has his own personal opinion about, you know, Mick West and everyone&#x27;s allowed their own opinion. I&#x27;m not really a fan of me personally like I can appreciate what different people bring to the field essentially, right? And then I&#x27;ve had people tell, &quot;Oh, you interview Mick West? I&#x27;m done with you.&quot; It&#x27;s like, &quot;What? You don&#x27;t want me to talk to different people?&quot; I mean, the way Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan describes Mick West approach to it, people do that in the UFO community on the other side. They&#x27;re not quote debunkers, but they&#x27;re believers right away. They believe right away and he talks to them, right? People interact with them. So it&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s not really about the conclusion.</p>
<p>I think the point he&#x27;s trying to make is that you have a preset conclusion. Well, people do that on both sides. Skeptic, you know, debunking and believing. They debunk in their mind before they even hear the story and they&#x27;re believe the story before they hear the story. Right? So it, you know, it&#x27;s just about the bias and the preset conclusion.</p>
<p>But, you know, again, to me, it happens on both sides. So, I think if to be fair, if Dr. Gary Nola is going to take that approach with MC West, he&#x27;d have to take that approach with a lot of people that are quote believers in the UFO community as well, and I haven&#x27;t really seen him speak up about that. Now, maybe he just hasn&#x27;t been asked. But, um, again, Gary Nolan&#x27;s a much smarter guy than me, so I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s thought this through.</p>
<p>But, you know, that&#x27;s just kind of my opinion. Um, and I know I&#x27;m going to get some hate in the comments. Patrick, you like MC West? You like Yeah, I like a lot of people. I They can have different opinions than me. I may not agree with them.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like just because you like somebody, people think, &quot;Oh, you agree with everything they say.&quot; That&#x27;s stupid. What? Like, how old are you? Life is literally about disagreeing with people. That&#x27;s what you learn in life. It&#x27;s not just trying to surround yourself with people that you agree with on everything. How boring, right? I mean, I like disagreeing with people respectfully.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s how you learn. Listening. You you you know what&#x27;s the saying? You were given two ears and one mouth so you could listen more than speak, right? So, and trust me, I take that advice myself. I have to, you know, uh be accountable for that myself. Um but anyway, let me know what you think down in the comments.</p>
<p>Should Dr. Gary Nolan debate Mick West or at least just have a conversation? Maybe not a debate. Now, let&#x27;s get to this. Are aliens an imminent threat to humanity? Right? Because again, that is something to consider. Hey, are we alone? You know, and are they coming here to Earth? And if they are, should we be worried? I think that&#x27;s an absolutely fair and poignant question to ask.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I want to ask you one more question before we let you go. I really I would love to have coffee with you because I have many other things I want to ask you. Um do you think that there given everything you know, everything you&#x27;re gathering, everything you&#x27;re seeing, everything you participated in in the Age of Disclosure documentary, do you think we are at risk either physically or existentially? Is there some imminent threat potentially either from adversarial forces within this solar system or from outside the solar system? &gt;&gt; For them to be a threat, they&#x27;d have to need something that we have. &gt;&gt; We have you. I&#x27;m offering you up.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s here&#x27;s Gary. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much. Um but um well, if they if they land and open the door, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m on board. you know, I was 65 two days ago, so uh &gt;&gt; happy birthday. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m like I would go on that adventure.</p>
<p>Um you know, uh but no, I I I I really don&#x27;t. Um and maybe this is just cuz I&#x27;m an optimist, but uh but but I&#x27;m also practical. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s there&#x27;s really apart from the ecosphere, &gt;&gt; which we&#x27;re doing our best to destroy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There&#x27;s nothing here that they can&#x27;t get in a thousand other places.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. you know, there&#x27;s no resource, there&#x27;s no whatever. We might want resources in the in in the African savannah, but there are certain uh animals that live there that can live nowhere else. Uh and um so maybe we just let them let them live for as long as as they can until the climate might change so drastically. But um you know, but species come and species go because climates do change over the course of geological history.</p>
<p>You know, I often say to people, it&#x27;s like, look, in geological terms, you you you neither mattered nor will you matter, you know, across the course of of of history. It&#x27;s the collective force. So, I I just um I just don&#x27;t know, I just don&#x27;t see I mean, people are always like, &quot;Oh, 2026, oh, 10 years from now, something or this or that&#x27;s going to happen.&quot; Maybe um but if I can&#x27;t control it, I&#x27;m not going to sit around worrying about it. Um, I can prepare contingencies, let&#x27;s say, but I I&#x27;m not living I&#x27;m not interested in living in a post-apocalyptic world where um I can&#x27;t order something from Amazon and get it the next day. All it would take any advanced society to do if they wanted to wipe us out is do what happened to the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Find find a big rock, point it our way, and you know that&#x27;s the end of life on Earth. and and start again. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s the optimistic take from Dr. Gary Nolan. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s that they haven&#x27;t done it yet.</p>
<p>And so I don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re that we&#x27;re in any short-term danger of anybody doing it again anytime soon. &gt;&gt; So this is an interesting perspective, right, about resources. Um, and first of all, let me just say happy birthday to Dr. Gary Nollet. Congratulations.</p>
<p>That is a big milestone. So happy birthday. Um, and this is an interesting setup, right? Like the aliens, we don&#x27;t have anything they would want. I mean, there was a lot of people in the UFO community who would disagree with that, right? I mean, you have theories out there that the aliens want our souls. They feed off our energy.</p>
<p>You know, Tom Dong, I&#x27;m talking about you, right? Like, and these are things government officials told him, right? Uh these aliens feed off of our energy, our vibrations, our souls, our emotions. Um they do want us. We do have something special. You know, there&#x27;s also theories out there that like, you know, aliens don&#x27;t feel anymore, right? They&#x27;re so advanced that they lost that ability and that&#x27;s why they want humans, right? We&#x27;re we&#x27;re this unique species. I mean, again, there&#x27;s so many theories out there that go against what Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan just said, but Gary Nolan&#x27;s looking at it very practically, which I can appreciate, right? What do we have on Earth that is so unique that isn&#x27;t out there in the rest of the universe? Kind of makes a good point as far as resources go. What do we really have here, right? Remember the Anunnaki, like they came here for the gold and it&#x27;s like, dude, gold&#x27;s everywhere. Plus, we can make gold now. Do you know that? So, that totally bunks Anunnaki, you know? And I love that story. Shout out Hecklefish, right? Like, but it just like if we found out how to make gold, then definitely they would have figured it out and wouldn&#x27;t need to create a whole race on Earth to mine gold, right? Like it doesn&#x27;t make sense.</p>
<p>Um, and there are probably asteroids floating around with gold, right? Like, but there are all the resources on Earth are throughout the universe. So, what would we really have here that&#x27;s unique, you know, on Earth? Like music, that&#x27;s probably out there. Music is this natural thing, right? These tones, these I mean, you know what I mean? Like the key of E is the key of E, right? So, I don&#x27;t know. Um, it&#x27;s definitely an interesting way to look at it, right? And if they did want to kill us, they would just shoot a rock at us, right? Like they did maybe with the dinosaurs. uh which is interesting.</p>
<p>And then he&#x27;s also like, you know, addresses the sort of rumors out there that there&#x27;s this impeding event, right? Um this incoming, you know, prophecy that the end of the world, the aliens are coming back, um you know, going to destroy Earth or take over Earth or all this stuff, right? You hear 2027, you know, and even Chris Bledo changes prophecy, right? from Easter 2026 to September 2026 now. Uh but then you have 2027. I&#x27;ve heard the 2030s, you know, all this BS, right? Um and he&#x27;s right. If you can&#x27;t, I mean, it&#x27;s out of your control. Why even worry about that, right? It&#x27;s probably not true.</p>
<p>And Jeremy Corbel came out and said that, right? It&#x27;s probably the CIA that told him this is going to happen. They&#x27;re going to use this as a fall, you know, false flag event, right? This alien threat invasion, right? Um because painting it as a threat is how you would get funding, right? We need to prepare. We need money, right? But again, like I said, to to some extent, you&#x27;d have to look, you&#x27;d have to be cautious. Maybe it&#x27;s not a threat, but you still need to be cautious that there could be ramifications, brain fryings by interacting with this new advanced species or species or their technologies. Right.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s all fair. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a very nuanced field and a very nuanced approach. And that&#x27;s probably what I&#x27;ve taken away most from watching this interview from Dr. Gary Nolan and really thinking about this deeply in a way that maybe I haven&#x27;t before or I have. I just didn&#x27;t realize it.</p>
<p>You know, really approaching this is so nuanced. It isn&#x27;t so black and white and it isn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s one way or this way or that way. There&#x27;s many different ways to look at it and to approach it because one, there&#x27;s a lot of information we just don&#x27;t know. Even though there&#x27;s a lot of people out there telling you they do know and they&#x27;re being channeled by aliens and they can tell you what&#x27;s going on. You know, I&#x27;m speaking to Zunoga from the, you know, planet Zudu Boou and, you know, they&#x27;re telling me humanity that it&#x27;s like, okay, what am I going to do with that, you know? So, we got to look at the nuts and bolts like what&#x27;s happening really in front of us and really think about this practically and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>Um, but it would be interesting to think about are there maybe there is a resource on Earth that they would want, right? Maybe that needs to be thought of a little bit more. Could we be the resource, right, as humans? Yeah, there&#x27;s definitely life in the universe, but did they all evolve like us, right? And what if we were created by aliens and we&#x27;re some unique hybrid, right? We would be special in some way. Now, that&#x27;s very weird approach, too, right? When people start to think I&#x27;m special, we&#x27;re special. I mean, I don&#x27;t really think that, to be honest, but I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s just an interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p>So, let me know what you think down in the comments. Um, I&#x27;m going to put a link to the full interview down below. It&#x27;s really, really interesting. A lot more talked about than than I discussed. And, uh, we&#x27;ll see you guys in the next one, better.</p>
<p>So, remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace. Hi. Um, I just want to say my experience in 2011 in Columbus, Ohio. I was driving from and I was driving my truck and I was just coming back from a dinner date with two friends.</p>
<p>And when I was driving back, I was going up this uh this ramp. And when I went up the ramp, right in front of me were this massive UFO. This thing was like the half the size of a building. I kept going and eventually I went underneath it with my truck. But not long after that it vanished the plate.</p>
<p>This was a heavy heavily populated place. I would think someone would have documented this. It was right next to a Walmart, a gas station, actually next three gas stations. I mean, a lot of people would have seen this. I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if someone did document it this or not, but I did see something about this on the news.</p>
<p>It just said there was strange sightings. Yeah. Um it was it was round this UFO. It was it looked sort it looked like your typical UFO but it was very r it was it was round and disc shaped. Um yeah it was most amazing experience of my life.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
