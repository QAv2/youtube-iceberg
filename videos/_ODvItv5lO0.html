            <p>software to die for the promise software scandal and how the u.s justice department became software pirates in the name of national security with ted st ring or teed if you prefer brought to you by tour camp and torcon.org check them out www www.mediaarchive.com proudly presents this material thank you for watching also check out www.promussscandle.com you know the rule of suicide but you know it&#x27;s funny i had another good friend of mine another father figure of mine uh ended up dying the same way not just one but then they had another gunshot to the head so of course he didn&#x27;t make the claim that he&#x27;d never kill himself and then anybody know who this is mae brussel she&#x27;s basically responsible for starting all this all the conspiracies all the 1960s you know the any heard anybody heard the gemstone file google that one the gemstone file uh she&#x27;s not involved with of course but it was you know it&#x27;s like one of these underground white papers that spread from you know underground activist underground activists you know this is the way it was it&#x27;s basically a timeline of the kennedy assassination the gemstone file but anyway so may brussel rests in peace for her too she&#x27;s a great gal she had a radio show and all sorts of stuff out of the bay area amazing and then once again my friend ken thomas uh he&#x27;s pretty much the only surviving you know journalist left reporting the story and once again with jim keith he wrote this book called the octopus available on amazon for like a couple bucks you know used i highly recommend reading it a lot of the research i did from here oh yeah and there was that well that&#x27;s danny casalero supposedly you know that&#x27;s an artist&#x27;s rendition of danny in the in the bathroom you know and so um and i&#x27;d go closer on that but then i press screw up my presentation and so uh so there&#x27;s been a number of other researchers you know had some problems michael rupert you know has been re reporting on promise for years and years from thewilderness.com is the website still active he actually had moved to ashland and then somebody broke into his offices and smashed up all his computers and everything and not only that they took his computers apart and smashed up the ic chips that were in the hard drives and everything in him and then he moved off to brazil and to venezuela where gas is 23 cents a gallon um and his current whereabouts are somewhere else oh and damn how did that get in there um so anyway there&#x27;s all sorts of anybody know who jack parsons is oh we got a jack parsons fan yay but jack parsons is basically the guy responsible for the um the helium nitrogen fueled engine that we use on the space shuttle and we use in all the atlas rockets in fact the titan missile that came out of here was probably you know based on some design that he developed at jpl in fact they called they called jpl and it wasn&#x27;t jet propulsion labs it was jack parsons personal lab basically because he&#x27;s the one that basically developed it and so uh so what&#x27;s interesting though is jack parsons was all into this metaphysical stuff um and of course you know it all makes strange bed followers there with john kerry and everything and you wonder what the connections there are and so uh once again um you know baron&#x27;s financial weekly this this our magazine here the insight uh magazine on the news ran like um uh four or five or i think it&#x27;s a four-part article here the covers here all about the proma scandal this is all available online all nice really color color photographs so go check that out they&#x27;re out of business now but you can still read all about proma software this one&#x27;s not linked off my site but just search for insight magazine and so nothing is secret you know especially even back then nothing was really secret um this day we know that he&#x27;s you know the octopus the octopus wants to be a little more respectable now so they&#x27;ve dressed it up a little bit and you know put a suit and a tie and some software and some you know executive shoes on it but basically it&#x27;s just all about the same thing okay so so that&#x27;s the basic presentation now i&#x27;m going to talk more about recon shootout he&#x27;s a very very interesting guy um and of course here&#x27;s his sheriff&#x27;s department thing what happened was he he he was uh insula was suing the government trying to get their millions of dollars they rode and rakanasudo being the programmer filed a deposition in the case a deposition in the case and um within a week he had been arrested for uh manufacturing drugs out inside in fact it was right around here in spokane just just in eastern washington right here and they they raided his place somebody got some information they raided his place there&#x27;s still concern whether there was he&#x27;s actually manufacturing drugs he was actually doing mining on the property and some of these same chemicals could have been used for mining but you know knowing the kind of person he is you know who knows what the you know whole story is but needless to say within a week of him testifying and giving a deposition in the inslaw and the promise software thing he basically was facing 30 years in prison and he&#x27;s there today in fact i think he&#x27;s back in pennsylvania if anyone who wants to write to him i encourage it and so but in his younger years he uh he was a child prodigy he had made in fact anybody heard of hercules california i used to live there for like a couple months surprisingly before i knew all about the connections but there was a thing called the hercules armament corporation i think it was and it&#x27;s basically just east of san francisco in a little town called hercules right near martinez which is the oil manufacturer and so they made they made these fuel air explosives that we were talking about and so this is what reconnaissauto is known at at 12 at 12 years old a tacoma boy here in washington grew up around here uh basically developed a um a you way to use sound um to basically weld uh hot spots and like metals and stuff and here&#x27;s an article on the new um basically freezing hot spots and metal and stuff and he sees a child prodigy developed all this electrostatic cooling simplifies the welding of wing pins you know 12 13 years old this kid&#x27;s you know designing this stuff and here he is uh there he is in the center with his dad marshall reconnaissauto some of these pictures are kind of hard to find and so uh so he was all in the middle of this because he was the one that supposedly developed and changed the software once again the last circle i think it&#x27;s a lastcircle.org it could be um and so so he uh you know he basically uh went to went to bat for for promise and the install because you know he had the inside information about all the stuff that was going on and of course a lot of the stuff was sealed up you&#x27;ll never see it for like 50 years can&#x27;t you think the kennedy assassination was bad like this is like above that sorry to say and so you know within a week let&#x27;s see if we got the articles here this is um 4 4 1991. and oh yeah this has been so within march 31st 1991 within days of castellero being murdered and within a week of or conocito giving his testimony in front of the deposition he&#x27;s jailed for 30 years and there he sits in prison and people go there to interview him and he tells a story you know there&#x27;s only so much he can say right after he&#x27;s thrown into prison he was providing all sorts of information he&#x27;s calling people collect and providing all sorts of information in fact i&#x27;ve got i&#x27;ve got the whole thing here that we just probably don&#x27;t have time for because we&#x27;re going to run out of tape got 90 minutes on the one tape and so but what&#x27;s very interesting is that uh back you know he was the guy that met with osama bin laden or tim osman you know there&#x27;s a michael oscar presented here i found that very interesting that you know tim osman you know was osama&#x27;s name that the cia had given him and um and so once again um there&#x27;s all these um basically different stories and uh here&#x27;s an example they were when he met with osama bin laden they were there to discuss how to get osama some of these man pads these these air surface-to-air missiles that they need to shoot out these these you know these these these russian fighters you know that we were fighting against here on this missile base but they couldn&#x27;t do it because they&#x27;re all the import controls and so so reconnaissauto knew some people where they could get the raw materials um i forget where it was but because we&#x27;re connoisseurs were involved with this hercules armament corporation they could get the raw materials shipped in from china somewhere and they could manufacture them in a place that they called the pakistan ordnance works and so then they could get all the rod and so then they could develop they could make their own stinger missiles on site and so it was reconnaissauto who set this all up i mean reconnaissance was doing this as a service of the country just like the people would go down every day and every week and be in these silos all day long and you know ready to press the button this is what kind of studio he was fighting the enemy supposedly this big puppet enemy that they had created you know called the soviet union you know and so so connoisseur is all over the place you know here he is and he was a he was a narcotic he was into he was in a narcotics field back when he was working you know uh uh you know secret clearances and stuff he&#x27;s working in narcotics and stuff of course you know you got to be working in narcotics to be able to you know be able to know enough about narcotics to be able to smuggle drugs for the cia and the daai i will add and so uh and reconnaissance very helpful he solved his help after he was in prison he helped solve the murder he helped solve murders and cabazon these people that had been murdered in cabazon he started sending information to the the chief of police the new chief of police there to help solve some of these murders that occurred because he had inside information and still does see it&#x27;s amazing he&#x27;s still alive if the one person they should have killed it would have been reconnaissauto but somehow they did him such a big favor that they said ah here you can just live in prison here eat the nice food here in the federal peninsula and we&#x27;ll see in 30 years maybe we&#x27;ll get out maybe not and so reconnaissance all over the place um narcotics san francisco bureau you know 1982. and of course they didn&#x27;t find any drug-like contamination at the site when they did the soil test you know supposedly they cleaned it all up and stuff but anyway so there&#x27;s controversy on whether you know he was actually manufacturing drugs at the site at all and whether they just wanted to get him out of the picture and shut them up which effectively they&#x27;ve done and so another interesting thing about reconnaissance he wrote this this four page letter i got it here you should read it online notice the date february 5th 2001. and it just goes on and on and he sent this letter to his attorney and talks all about his involvement with promise and all about his involvement with obama osama bin laden and barack obama no and um but you know i should make the point that all these same these same institutions and this say these sen this same people that were involved with all of this stuff were the same people who brought it to the bush administration which is basically the same thing as the obama administration all these same players and all these key people especially now they brought all these clinton people back you know from the from the closet you know they brought all these these old advisors in and it&#x27;s basically all the same people then because it wasn&#x27;t just the republicans that were after the software the democrats had uses for it too you know it goes way above all that of course me you know i didn&#x27;t know but i filmed the libertarian national convention like a year ago and i didn&#x27;t realize it but i&#x27;ll be damned if i&#x27;m not a libertarian you know i don&#x27;t know how that happened but so anyway so he sends this big letter and in it uh he predicts 9 11. he says there&#x27;s going to be a big terrorist event happening in the united states um um terrorists who plan on entering the united states in the very near future uh for for purposes of terrorist activities he wishes to speak to you about this blah blah blah and so this all was sent to this was sent to colin powell it was sent to all the people in government that this guy in prison had information about a future terrorist attack preceding 911 this one&#x27;s dated february 19 2001 and and here are you know here&#x27;s the certified return receipts from the attorney mailing and all these places and of course you know the 911 hijackers they&#x27;re just laughing it up you know and not only where we try i don&#x27;t know how much you guys know about 911 not only were we tracking you know all these people but you know we also there were other intelligence agencies around the world tracking them as well and leaving pass for them to be open letting them you know escape another pass so so once again it it&#x27;s a very interesting tangled web we weave and once again it&#x27;s all about you know that big brother is watching us and you know there&#x27;s really no getting around it um anybody gotta know who this guy is george wackenhut security guy excellent whacking that security we&#x27;ve got a bright crowd here today in the july 5th 2009 at 3 33 in the morning at the nuclear missile base and so um what&#x27;s interesting is that whack and hud handles security uh you know for all the nuclear installations the fact that this base was still an organization whacking had a private it&#x27;s basically the private fbi when you retire from the fbi or the cia you go to work for a whacking hut they find something for you to do so you can live out your your your little ears and the twilight of nuclear security um and you know of course they&#x27;re best known for you know handle security at you know the infamous area 51.</p>
<p>you know the only ufo i&#x27;ve ever seen in my life has been flying over area 51. you know they call it old faithful it used to be out in the 90s late 80s 90s if you went out there you could you know go out there at 4 55 in the morning thursday morning and you sit in a certain spot and old faithful come up over the horizon and then it might blink out and a millisecond later it would be 5 000 feet in the air just like blink blink blink and there&#x27;s no physical way that that could happen you know like with today&#x27;s technology it&#x27;s using this reverse engineer supposedly alien technology or if you follow like anagravitics another google term to google anti-gravity craft or anti-gravity uh t-towns and brown the paul byfield effect for an example and so all these technologies have been developed you know i don&#x27;t really necessarily believe that ufos are coming from extraterrestrial civilizations i mean they exist out there i&#x27;m sure and they&#x27;ve probably been here many times you know and look for intelligent life and of course didn&#x27;t find any but a lot of the technology we have these ufos they can all be man-made in fact there was a big air flap from the big ufo air flap of 1897 where a series of ufos were seen flying over a texas town in in texas and supposedly they were developed right here in the usa</p>
