            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hey, what&#x27;s up? What&#x27;s up, YouTube? YouTube YouTube. What is everyone doing tonight? Present, not tardy. You&#x27;re all late. Yeah, I&#x27;m so I&#x27;m sorry for being a little late. We&#x27;re here tonight.</p>
<p>First thing I want to do because I can&#x27;t find the video and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m trying to go back and find it. Uh, it was obviously predates this interview from June 2021 because I sent the questions ahead of time to um Kurt to ask Lou about this specific question and Lou gave uh a response here which is timestamped at 15:47 in this video. Um, I&#x27;m going to copy that and post it in the video details in the description so that people can go find it. Um, lose interview on POE with Kurt and that&#x27;s there. But there was a prior interview and I thought that it was on Kurt Jamunle, but I before the show I was just going over and trying to find it.</p>
<p>Um, and I couldn&#x27;t find it. But I know that it predates this June 23rd date. So I was going to ask the audience if they could kindly um go around to all the Lou Alzano interviews that are on the internet that predate um or in the month or two before um 2021 and just do a do a go right here to this and say show transcript and that will show the transcript of the interview. And I believe the word is quintessential. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s the word that&#x27;s the unique word he or phrase that he used when he described who brought him on to the actual ATIP program.</p>
<p>Cuz there&#x27;s this whole argument going on on Twitter right now, you know, with with um with uh Alzando and um Lou Alzando and Green Street and Greenwald. So John Greenwald Jr. who runs the blackvault.com. It has been posting a lot of stuff along with uh Stephen Greenreet of um the basement uh office podcast has been going after kind of Lu Alzando for being the the director of ATIP. He claims he was the director of ATIP.</p>
<p>And this is Luzando&#x27;s recent tweet. It&#x27;s got 700 almost 800 likes now. 771 likes and uh a number of retweets. This was uh this was um tweeted at 3:45 p.m. today, you know, so just a few hours ago, and it&#x27;s already got almost 800 likes.</p>
<p>And uh Lou doubles down. He says, &quot;I was the director of ATIP. It has been well documented. I have been the subject of a campaign of defamatory disinformation by multiple parties.&quot; Again, my thanks to Todd McMurdy. And uh Todd McMurdy&#x27;s quote was uh surely I hope you don&#x27;t defame Lou Alzando.</p>
<p>It is well documented that he was the director of ATIP and any participation in a plan to cast doubt on that uh truth is a knowing effort to defame and so disinformation. It&#x27;s legally actionable. Okay. So this is the threat that they&#x27;ve put out now that that anyone who dis defames or tries to talk about you know you know Lu Alzando is is legally actionable. So, I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t unlike Green Street or Greenwald, I&#x27;m not sure what their stances are currently or I know that they&#x27;ve put out some videos in the past, but um John Greenwald&#x27;s blocked me.</p>
<p>So, I can&#x27;t really keep up to date with anything that he&#x27;s working on because, you know, he he&#x27;s got his own issues with people that, you know, call him out on, you know, things statements that he&#x27;s made. And, you know, rather than confront me, he likes to call me names and block me. So that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s all good. But um yeah, there&#x27;s some people in the audience that think that Lou is a fraud. Uh there&#x27;s a number of other channels out there that have you know um Manny uh that guy he he came on I think the podcast one time uh who is Lou documentary.</p>
<p>If you type who is Lou Ellis movie um there&#x27;s this there&#x27;s this movie called who islmov.com and uh he made this movie you know this documentary about Lou Alzando and you know there&#x27;s a couple interesting things that he pointed out about Lou&#x27;s activities and his employment career and uh you know but you know it&#x27;s good information in there I encourage people to look into it and the documentation that backs it up you know for the for the real researchers you know That&#x27;s kind of a boring and long drawn out documentary with uh I again my apologies Manny, but not the best editing. Um yeah, it it could have been a lot shorter and a lot more concise and uh you should probably make like a a five or 10 minute version just consolidating everything rather than trying to drag it on and drag it out. Um but yeah, there&#x27;s some key hitting interesting information about Lou&#x27;s, you know, history and his career as an intelligence and counter intelligence officer. But um this whole thing with the program, I&#x27;m trying to find this quintessential. It was it was from this documentary and I&#x27;m going to play the I&#x27;m going to play this clip because I want people to uh hear from Lou&#x27;s own words, you know, I don&#x27;t want to put words in anybody&#x27;s mouth.</p>
<p>And um it was this one right here with the Jeremy wrist. It starts at about 15 15 minutes. You need you need all the pieces to really really you know understand [clears throat] what you&#x27;re looking at. You mentioned someone&#x27;s name about a minute ago. Harold.</p>
<p>What was his last name? Cruto. Okay. Yeah. I have a question about that from Jeremy Riss of the channel Alien Scientist. He wants to know, have you ever heard of something called the invisible college? And then as a secondary question, was this theoretical physicist who brought you into the program, you mentioned this before that someone brought you in to ATIP? Was it Hal put off? I&#x27;m very well aware of the the term invisible college.</p>
<p>Uh I am also very well aware of how Hal is is a dear friend of mine. He did not bring me into this program. uh but we wound up uh working as as colleagues. Um he&#x27;s an incredible human being. Him and other individual named Dr.</p>
<p>Kate Green uh is another fantastic human being, an absolute American treasure. Um and there&#x27;s a couple others. Dr. Eric Davis is another one. I I really was very fortunate.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to to [clears throat] truly stand on the shoulders of giants. Um it was an incredible honor. And there&#x27;s many others that I I won&#x27;t mention right now, but Dr. call and tell her a bunch of others that were you know really really helpful uh in the early days of of this effort. What is it that you&#x27;ve heard about the invisible college that you can reveal that you feel like is credible? I just heard the term yesterday.</p>
<p>I mean uh it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s a loose affiliation of individuals um you know thus the term invisible uh college being that these are individuals who obviously have a high academic vet uh to their name. um you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more of a loose affiliation necessarily than a um uh you know a formalized uh corporation. Um you know it&#x27;s you might also hear terms like the aviary which uh you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s some truth to that. There were some individuals that belong to an organization and u to to to remain anonymous uh they had names of birds associated with them. So names of birds birds right that&#x27;s the term aviary and what it did is it gave them an extra degree of anonymity uh when when having discussions uh you know especially over open lines or the email answer your email um you know that that that&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a layer extra layer of operation what we call ops speaking of academia this question comes from professor of astronomy Brian Keading who runs the All right well sorry to cut you off Brian Actually, I I kind of want to play Brian&#x27;s question now because he got longer response than mine.</p>
<p>Um, which, you know, is all right. You actually, I&#x27;m going to leave that to you guys because I don&#x27;t want to like blow up Curt&#x27;s channel, but the video uh link to this video is in the description of this channel. Go check out Curt&#x27;s channel if you haven&#x27;t. He&#x27;s got some great interviews with Lou. It might be great to go back and watch some of those in retrospect to find that.</p>
<p>Again, I&#x27;m asking the audience for their help in going find in finding the Lou Alzando interview that predates June 23rd, 2020 21. Uh where Lou Alzando I want the exact clip and if we can get it up um someone can post it or something or send it to me. I want the exact clip where he says um about who brought him onto the program because he describes this quint you know was a guy who looked like Bob Lazar you know your quintessential quantum physicist. This is how I remember it. This is how my brain remembers it.</p>
<p>Quintessential might be the key word. Um I&#x27;ve tried searching the transcripts for, you know, Quinn. Um and and it just it it goes dead. So maybe we can go find a an interview with um Lou Alzando that predates this and do a show transcript and then document search for Quintessential. And I&#x27;ll ask the audience to do that in the background for me until they find this interview where um Lou describes the person who brought him on to the ATIP program that he was you know he is now doubling down and saying that you know he was he was the director of this ATIP program.</p>
<p>Um but I want to point out that there was this interview that you know he describes this quintessential quantum physicist. Um that&#x27;s how I remember it. Maybe he said theoretical physicist. Maybe quantum and theoretical might be maybe switched around there. So, but quintessential was like the key word.</p>
<p>I I definitely um I definitely remember that we could find that. I want to show that and put put a little short video together um going over this point. But the real idea is that um scientists, you know, Lou Lou has been on a couple of shows and tried to talk about the science and stuff of of UFOs and and UAP and it&#x27;s been really really bad honestly. like that he&#x27;s tried to talk about the science and we know that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty clear that he&#x27;s not the one who authored these uh DR DID reports, these defense intelligence reference documents. He he talks about a number of individuals including um Hal Putoff and Eric Davis who I know for a fact um participated in a number of these uh intelligence uh briefing documents for the defense intelligence establishment.</p>
<p>So um you know he mentions these guys. He says there&#x27;s a theor theoretical physicist who looked like Bob Lazard that brought me on the program. Um but he can&#x27;t mention that person&#x27;s name. I I asked him directly was it Hal put off you know because I know that Hal has been involved in a lot of this classified physics research stuff for a long long time with the CIA uh going back to Stanford University um I mean the Stanford not Stanford University but the Stanford Research Institute which was named that because of uh Stanford&#x27;s high standing as an academic institute um So uh I believe Stanford is like number two under Harvard and then number three is MIT in the latest polls. So Stanford is this really prestigious uh academic institution and uh they they worked for this organization called the Stanford Research Institute which had nothing to do wasn&#x27;t affiliated with Stanford University but got all kinds of recognition because of the name and they did a lot of weird wacky kind of you know far out research for the CIA.</p>
<p>um which some people think is you know part of a disinformation program but there are some gems in here uh too according to you know my analysis and I&#x27;ve dug through a lot of their stuff that they they they do have a lot of interesting physics background and do teach you a lot of interesting stuff about the about physics through these um DID documents but I doubt that you know Lu Alzando has the technical knowhow or scientific background to really author these type of documents which again are the real intelligence for anyone who&#x27;s intelligent and knows what int real intelligence looks like. Um this is the real ins and outs and and science of the engineering of these 0 point uh frequency vacuum modes and QED energy and and uh the real you know kasmir forces and and how they&#x27;re and all the modeling and all the background research that digs into the deep physics of how UFOs could fly is all in these defense intelligence reference documents which Luzando can&#x27;t speak too, you know, he he he takes his public persona, but he, you know, he says he was the director of ATIP, uh, but his science knowledge and his when he&#x27;s ever spoken about the science is is pretty limited. And you can tell that, you know, based on his response in that interview with Kurt Jamongle that and and based on, you know, other interviews he&#x27;s given that I&#x27;ve watched where he&#x27;s talked about the science that he doesn&#x27;t really know the science and isn&#x27;t really deep on the science, even if he was the director of this program, you know, quote unquote, and it&#x27;s officially documented. And you know, even if the Pentagon admits that, you know, now that he was he was the director and, you know, we we created this whole controversy with John Greenwald just to stir up some fake controversy to um keep people distracted and busy for a while. Um, that&#x27;s what I really think is going on.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, maybe they did put this guy as director of the program. But remember that interview and we got to find that and go back and look for it because I know it exists because I asked him about it and I&#x27;m going to try and find the email maybe I I I&#x27;m sure I sourced it because I usually do where I&#x27;m like, well, in this interview he says this. So, I got to go find that. I can&#x27;t find it right now because I search for Lou Alzando and Kurt Jamongle and all I find are Jack Sarati emails. Um, but it&#x27;s I gotta go through and find it.</p>
<p>I know it&#x27;s there and we will get it if someone doesn&#x27;t get it by the end of the stream and join. And you know, um, in any case, he said that a theoretical physicist brought him onto the program. That&#x27;s what Lou Alazandanda said. And I want to stress that the theoretical physics and the science behind UAP are the key to disclosure and the key to real intelligence and realformational disclosure. And the real the real disclosure happened already.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s in the bibliographies of these DID reports. and anyone who&#x27;s savvy and academic and I don&#x27;t know bored enough to go through all this and uh dig into it and can learn and can figure it out. But the thing is that that&#x27;s people don&#x27;t understand. I think the disclosure is going to be this big in your face like, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re going to come out and and and and teach you all how tractor beams work and [clears throat] how we can lift up cattle with a with a a tractor beam u into a UFO from above and how much energy it would take and and the las type of lazing and the the type of microwave phase conjugation that would be required to create this um deficienc this this distractor beam effect because they&#x27;ve done it and you can look up MIT tractor beam and uh [snorts] you know and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s there&#x27;s document there&#x27;s not documentation of all that stuff in here but again the alien scientist channel we&#x27;ve interviewed the people if you want to learn about the tractor beam technology you watch my interview from the most recent one I did with Jack Sarat a couple months ago um if you look up that one he he talks about some interesting papers that came out and um again we we we cover all this stuff and uh and talk about it on this channel. And it&#x27;s just this stuff, it&#x27;s crazy how it&#x27;s like such awesome Star Trek level physics, yet it gets zero attention from the mainstream media and all that that&#x27;s out there.</p>
<p>Like again on Jeremy Corbel back on Joe Rogan talking about element 115 and talking about, you know, this Bob Lazar physics and it&#x27;s like come on, dude. like how many how many real scientists have we interviewed or or covered their work on this channel um that are way more qualified and way more like into real stuff than than Bob Lazar and his element 115 which you know we can date back to centuries old stuff. I mean Ge Georgie Flyarov if you guys don&#x27;t know who these physicists are these are the scientists that should take credit for Lint 115 and it&#x27;s a theoretical interpretation the discovery you know Maria Gopart Meyer a woman again not getting the the real credit that these scientists deserve um being erased from history by you know disinformation about element 115 and the island of stability that comes from Jeremy Corbell and Bob Lazar. a disgrace to science, a disgrace to humanity and our achievements and a life spent uh doing real physics and real study of a subject versus um someone who spends a lifetime just spreading disinformation and misinformation which catches fire and spreads around the world faster than you know the real academics can put this stuff out. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really sad that Maria Gopert Mayor um the person who theoretically wrote all the papers to for the island of stability and and predicted the island of stability back in the 1960s and won a Nobel Prize in physics for it gets zero [ __ ] credit.</p>
<p>Well, Bob Lazar gets, you know, repeated this lie that gets told by Jeremy Corbell and others that, you know, Bob Lazar discovered the island of stability in his element 115 and that this was the physics he was hired to work on out at, you know, um, Los Alamos for Area 51 and and yeah, [ __ ] dude. I go over all the real physics that went on in Area 51. I talk about, you know, the real scientists like Edward Mil Mills Pcel who headed project rainbow for the CIA. Um, we talk about the Peter Armbrustster and Godfred uh Munzenberg article where from Scientific American 1989, you know, where they was where, you know, that was the month and year that Bob Lazor came out with uh his big um disclosure that he was Dennis. And then he didn&#x27;t talk about the element 115 till October 1989, 5 months later.</p>
<p>And uh it&#x27;s obvious that he went and read some magazines and on science because scientific American published this article about element 115 by Godfred Munenberg and Peter Armbruster um which talked about the island of stability and talked about all a little bit about this theoretical physics um background but didn&#x27;t really uh get into the um the fact that it&#x27;s just Glenn Seabborg, here&#x27;s another guy, right, gets zero credit. Bob Lazar gets all the credit for discovering element 115. Glenn Seabborg discovered all these elements. They were just going up the num up the list. Anyone could have predicted element 115.</p>
<p>Glenn Seabborg predicted element 115, you know, easily. Any anyone who understood chemistry, the bas basic physical chemistry, the periodic table and the proton number understands that, you know, every time you add a proton to the nucleus, it goes up a number. So, you just keep adding. You know, why wouldn&#x27;t there be an element 115 somewhere on this periodic table that Dimmitri Mandelv, you know, predicted and talked about in 1871? it it just doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t click. It doesn&#x27;t compute.</p>
<p>But yet people don&#x27;t know this stuff. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh Okay, so I got a $20 super chat. Uh 20 pound mate cheerio. Hey Jay, it&#x27;s me personally think that Lou Alzando was employed as a dino beaver for quite some time. Might that be true? Well, Mike, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing English or or or uh Australian at this point, man.</p>
<p>[laughter] Dude, thank you for the money. Um, again, the aviary. Yeah, the aviary was another clue. Um, I want to point that out cuz before before we move on from that cuz the aviary was an interesting drop cuz you know Kurt Jamunal again was on there and and you know he dropped this thing about the aviary and talked about you know all the invisible college was this kind of same kind of thing. They did this aviary where they came out as these false names and stuff but that&#x27;s different than because these guys from the invisible college stayed invisible.</p>
<p>They never came out under false names. the guys who came under false names in the aviary. Um, you want to know who those were? Um, so, oh god, we got to find the old Bob Lazar debunked. No, wait. Yahoo video.</p>
<p>So, we search for videos and I want to search for 1988 UFO live TV. I think it&#x27;s from 1988 and it aired less the year before be in trouble because it oscillated October 14th through 1 a.m. and uh we looked up and there were All right, I&#x27;m going to stop screen share. I&#x27;m going to rescreen share with audio. Oh, and I&#x27;m going to copy this link and I&#x27;m going to post it in the chat at this timestamp so people can look this up.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m also going to post it in the video details under the aviary. I&#x27;m going to talk about the aviary. Aviary first appeared on TV under a segment of live TV uh called UFO live TV. Um and it was 1988. Um what was this guy&#x27;s Washington DC Moscow? I got to find this guy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s got to have this guy&#x27;s name somewhere on this. Come on. So Condor, right there we go. This guy he&#x27;s he comes under the name Condor. One of them was named uh Falcon in color and with light shining out through port holes and the really obtained presidential approval together with Jamie and we joined forces in June of 1982 and Falcon told us about MJ12 MJ MJ12 function.</p>
<p>So Falcon was the first person to talk about MJ12. Okay. So, I&#x27;m going to put this on down here because this needs to be like documented and I&#x27;m going to put it in the video description. Falcon is Richard Dodie. He&#x27;s the first person to delete the MJ12 documents.</p>
<p>He did it to Stanton Freriedman to discredit Stanton Freriedman and Stanton Freriedman fell for it hard. went went off on that tangent and um was lucky that he picked up on the Bob Lazar thing, but that also discredited him too cuz the the the disinformation took uh over which was again I think uh developed by the same people cuz this whole aviary he talks about the listen just listen as a policym group relating to extraterrestrial activities and contacts and UFO activities within the United States. They make the policy, obtain presidential approval, and then [clears throat] field activities implement the policies. How did you acquire the MJ12 documents? Well, they were mailed to me in a plain brown envelope, which contained President Truman&#x27;s executive order establishing MJ12 and the briefing document to President-elect Eisenhower, informing him of the 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico, and the recovery of alien bodies. And then there were follow-up postcards, Ethiopian picture postcards made from New Zealand with puzzles and riddles, right? The puzzles were clues.</p>
<p>For example, for a stylish look, shop Suitland. This led us to the National Repository in Sutland, Maryland, where we discovered the existence of top secret documents and filed a freedom of information request, which led us further to the Cutler Twining document. Now, all of our meetings with Falcon were secret. Now, wait, gentlemen. riddles, postcards, secret meetings, code words.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t you suspect somebody was pulling your leg? We always look for a hoax, but within every clue, there was always some verifiable fact. So, you were able to verify MJ12? Validating MJ12 was difficult because we couldn&#x27;t find any government agency that would admit publicly that they were aware of MJ12&#x27;s existence. Well, so without validating it, how do you get from there to here? Well, after hundreds of hours of research, we&#x27;re working with experts trying to validate the documents. But most important, the contacts have grown to include Falcon and nine other government agents. And why do you believe them? Well, because we&#x27;ve been able to meet with them.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been able to check and verify credentials, and it&#x27;s clear that they are in secret, need to know positions. Falcon&#x27;s position, for example, gives him access to the MJ12 infrastructure. Why don&#x27;t we just hear it in his own words? MJ12 was a group of people within the the government. MG12 was created by President Truman early 50s and their job was to investigate, keep track of information pertaining to UFOs. Part of their job was scientific advancements, [clears throat] but uh their primary purpose was to keep track of the information coming in on UFOs and to analyze the information both uh scientifically and [clears throat] in a way that would advance our technology.</p>
<p>There are government officials and elected officials that are automatically briefed on the existence of the MJ12. Dude, just look at the glasses and that profile outline. That&#x27;s Dodie. That&#x27;s Dodie, dude. Look at the head.</p>
<p>That square head. That&#x27;s Dodie, dude. Like, hands down. Activities officials. president, the vice president has elected officials, the director of central intelligence, and the director of the national security agency.</p>
<p>The MJ12 policy is headquartered at the Naval Observatory in Washington DC. The United States Navy has the primary operational responsibilities of field activities relating to the MJ12 policies. All information gathered in the field, not necessarily by Navy personnel, is transmitted to the Navy for analysis. Other known government agencies feed information to MJ12 through a top secret cover project known to us as Project Aquarius. Now MJ12 connects to select individuals within the National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House Intelligence Unit, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>The research is conducted, the data classified and cataloged, all under the umbrella of strictest national security. The MJ12 table of organization created by Mo and Chandere purports to give us an understanding of a complex intragovernmental chain of command existing solely to oversee, organize, and administer the data on UFOs and ETSs. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Thank you. When we come back, Falcon and Condor&#x27;s stunning re.</p>
<p>All right, I want to pay play so much more of this because a lot of people here have already seen this and it&#x27;s like boring for them. And um we have to come up with all the the names of So Condor. Let&#x27;s find Condor here. He was just I just had it. And uh we allow you to operate from a designated uh base here in the United States.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in the state of Nevada in an area called Area 51 or Dreamland. The [clears throat] extraterrestrials have complete control of this base, which is that&#x27;s that&#x27;s Dodie. You can tell even through the voice um the voice mod. But anyways, uh I would like to go and um document who all those people were from the aviary because I think one was Ed Fouche. Man, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Uh that was a key point that was just briefly mentioned and not elaborated on. It was just glossed over. You know, it&#x27;s good that, you know, Lou Alzando knew about that or talked about it. But man, like that was key information like like you should dig into that more because that opens up that opens up more of what&#x27;s really going on. Um, is there an MJ12? The way I think I look at it, right, because I&#x27;ve looked into a lot of these people from the M the MJ12 um MJ12, right? I&#x27;m going to stop screen and reshare screen.</p>
<p>Majestic 12, Wikipedia. So there was this document and it alleged that these members were um members of this MJ12 and the big thing centered around this whole issue of James Forestl and uh his weird and untimely death is the first United States Secretary of Defense. Um people say that he was his secretary of defense brought into some of that stuff on that program and um went crazy was sent to be um was sent to um Bethesda hospital, Naval Hospital in Maryland and to a ward that&#x27;s been notorious for um a rehabilitation ward where they send a lot of people who were exposed to, you know, alien crashes and couldn&#x27;t handle it or stuff like that. It was like a re a sort of reprogramming type of thing. Um, they basically like wake you up in this hospital and and convince you that, you know, what you saw wasn&#x27;t real and that, you know, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re cool and that you&#x27;re just went crazy and that you need to, you know, not talk about it and go back to your normal life.</p>
<p>So, people talk about the neuralizer and the neuralizer effect. Um, it wasn&#x27;t. It was actually they brought you to Bethesda Naval Hospital and it was a a bunch of techniques that were developed by um Cameron. What was his name? MK Ultra. Look up Cameron.</p>
<p>Owen. Cameron. Ooen. That&#x27;s his name. Eween Owen Cameron, the MK Ultra scientist, Donald Owen Cameron.</p>
<p>What an interesting guy. um the scientist that you know headed a lot of the MK Ultra stuff and uh any case um these scientists a lot of these people were I think loosely affiliated I don&#x27;t think there was ever actually an MJ12 organization between all these people in fact some of the people on here I feel were um deliberate, you know, side tracks, you know, like Vanavar Bush, you know, he was head of MIT and and head of a lot of the office of uh research and development, scientific research and development for during World War II and um did a lot of that recruiting out of MIT and stuff that identified, you know, the most brilliant talent, including the the team that identified Richard Fineman and brought him out at age 18 to go work on the Manhattan project. Um, so definitely involved with some top secret research and top secret physics stuff and and whatnot, but he totally was not um a believer in UFOs. None of these guys were believers in UFOs. a lot of them like Donald Mensel and um the astronomer and uh of Harvard and uh not Huait Vandenberg but um Vandenberg is another interesting guy involved with a lot of secret space program research with the Vandenberg Air Force Base and and the whole um the whole satellite program that launched all the top secret spy satellite lights and stuff for the NSA and uh other organizations.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t name Sydney Sour an American. You know, some of these names just look like they were thrown on the list. Um cuz there&#x27;s a number of scientists around at the time that I believe were much more deeply involved in the UFO um phenomenon research program. I think that this MJ12 thing was disinformation for a number of reasons because I think the Battel Memorial Institute and Howard C. Cross of Battel think that was a key key omission in the MJ12 documents.</p>
<p>If there was an MJ12, it was, you know, I don&#x27;t think there was this organization of of 12 scientists. They picked they it seems like they picked all these skeptics and said that they were part of the this conspiracy because they were all debunking it. But they were the guys that the CIA propped up because they were non-believers. They were these Christian people that were fundamentalists and couldn&#x27;t possibly believe that we were alone in the universe who went against all this crap um out of religious or other beliefs and um ended up debunking a lot of this stuff. And I think that they were labeled as part of this MJ12 group.</p>
<p>But again, I I believe that there were a number of other scientists who were much more um knowledgeable in that time era like John Archerold Wheeler. [laughter] Um Sarbacher, what&#x27;s his name? is in this. So, let me reload this. Yeah, John Elroy sensor. So, John von Noman, I believe, was one of the he he was um Manhattan Projects, one of the top scientists.</p>
<p>He had the highest level of security clearances. He he did all the atomic bomb calculations for the Manhattan project. He&#x27;s working out at Sandia Labs um which was four or five hour drive from Los from um the Corona crash site in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 would have been one of the scientists they would have brought out there right away. Um I believe u Robert Sarbotcher again another one of the physicists working at Sandia Labs was an expert in these types of uh technologies and and and the right he had the right um subject matter expertise which would have put him in a position to be hired for uh these types of activities. Battel and um Elroy Center testified on his deathbed to working with um pieces of Roswell material um or people pieces of material that he thought were not from this world.</p>
<p>Um and Howard Cros was the director of this program. This pinnacle memorandum named him in these J Allen High files as being the director of a top secret project end of project blue book which was involved in the metallurgy study. So this is the real stuff. It&#x27;s involved with um Battel which did all these um nighol uh nickel titanium alloy phase diagram studies. you know, there they did all these studies on titanium alloys, but there were like four pages dedicated to nickel titanium alloys specifically, and it was commissioned in 1949, just two years after Roswell um as a metallergy study for these metallurgists to do.</p>
<p>And they ended up part of the study was to to analyze samples of unknown origin and to to develop this um titanium base alloy. studies in chemical analysis of oxygen and titanium by the chlorine carbon tetrachloride method where they light this piece of uh material on fire and drop it in a um test tube full of chlorine carbine chlorine um tetrachloride and the tetrachloride is super reactive. It&#x27;s like chlorine on steroids and it just burns up whatever you drop in it and reacts with it and creates these off gases which then then measure and through this complex apparatus uh shown in the document and then tell you what&#x27;s inside of it. So, Battel would develop the and the methods to um analyze the memory foil or pieces of this metal that couldn&#x27;t be allegedly cut or or or destroyed uh to figure out what it was made of. and they would have possessed the scientists and uh yet Patel none of these scientists um they currently manage all of our national laboratories as well which is interesting uh as well but um none of those scientists are named none of the science is ever talked about and this is a key part of my presentation and uh a lot of the stuff that I talk about people have gone to jail for violating their NDAs to talk about you know classified information or to bring information and documents home from them from work, which leads us to more information about how all this stuff really works on the on the quantum level.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the the scientific intelligence is the real intelligence. And I&#x27;m sorry that Lou and the majority of the public really doesn&#x27;t understand the science and doesn&#x27;t get it. Um, and doesn&#x27;t have the time for it or, you know, the attention span or whatever. Um, but that&#x27;s I think where the real uh secrets of UFO technology and all the UFO stuff lie. And I and I really think that a lot of this stuff is put out there um on purpose as disinformation.</p>
<p>Uh, you know, so I&#x27;m not trying to defame Lu Alzando. I appreciate, you know, anyone who comes forward from these programs to come out publicly and talk about these things. You know what I mean? Um, I just think that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of stupid that he can&#x27;t talk about anything and cites the NDA and, you know, and that kind of stuff and won&#x27;t talk more about this physicist who brought him onto the program even though he was director. You know, there was a scientist who brought him onto the program and I think it&#x27;s a key point. We have to find that video and that and that um timestamp where he talks about that uh physicist for me because my background is in physics and math and I had no idea that people were so divisive when it comes to Bob Oh, the divisive miss of Bob Lazar thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I don&#x27;t know. That&#x27;s just a whole another story. The Bob Lazarus thing. Um should make a documentary on the Bob Lazar thing just to shut Jeremy Corbel down because it&#x27;s like seems to be his cash cow.</p>
<p>Um yeah, the who&#x27;s Lou do documentary is all right. It draws some interesting points, but again there&#x27;s no like smoking gun that Lou is a you know disinformation agent or a counter inelligence agent. Um it&#x27;s just that unfortunate that you know he&#x27;s just knows as much as us. he&#x27;s brought on the program again the physicists and the and the scientists that he cites as his part of his research uh amount to let let&#x27;s count them right he mentioned them on on on this earlier it was Halutoff Eric Davis all you know these guys have done some good research they&#x27;ve also been involved in you know Halpov was a Scientologist and involved with a whole bunch of weird poltergeist stuff that kind of discredited him a little bit in the eyes of mainstream scientific community. Um, but again, still maybe some room there for a recovery.</p>
<p>Uh, if you know, something ever comes of all this, I&#x27;m open to it. But again, very skeptical and willing to investigate any claims of poltergeist activity. I had some guy, you know, said he wrote this thing on quantum paranormal stuff and he had this whole book on it and wanted me to come out to this uh site in the UK and stay for a night. And I said, heck, I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll do it. you know, I&#x27;ll come out there and stay at this, you know, poltergeist haunted thing.</p>
<p>And I never heard back from him. He just stopped contacting me. I told him, you know, my background and stuff and and and it just ended. I don&#x27;t know. And so, it&#x27;s just weird cuz I really like to investigate that kind of stuff and and find proof for it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m open to it, but again, I&#x27;m very skeptical and I&#x27;d be bringing a lot of scientific equipment and sensors and and that kind of stuff with me if I did those types of investigations. Um, so this is interesting because uh the quintessential quantum physicist brings him out of this program and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m super also super interested in in the science and the physics and the math of this as well. And Lou is not the person for that. He cites, you know, some of these scientists and these who I no doubt authored a number of these DRD reports for the um, you know, for the US Air Force and for the the uh, DoD. So, these are where the real intelligence is.</p>
<p>This is where the real sciences is in these reports. and until you&#x27;ve really gone through these and can come on the show and talk about this. And I posted the link in the description, you know, so people can join and come and talk about this stuff. But I don&#x27;t really get too many people come on here and just like, hey, I know all about this stuff or I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time breeding this stuff. It&#x27;s crazy because like we don&#x27;t we we&#x27;re not breaking a 100red viewers.</p>
<p>We used to break like 200 500 viewers on this channel on on other nights, but like people don&#x27;t want to. Yeah, I guess people are sick about hearing about about Eric Davis. Um I don&#x27;t know. But Eric Davis has done some good research. He has some good insights into how to produce these negative energies and you know weighs around this whole theoretical model saying that we need you know the amount of an entire star to uh produce the wormhole.</p>
<p>uh energies required to open you know a wormhole just big enough to bring a quarter through. Um, no we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t there&#x27;s other ways around this and there there&#x27;s other ways of reinterpreting physics through these metamaterials and through these lens lensing effects um and these polariton lasers and what they can do to the space-time continuing um with these you know columnated uh energy emissions around objects that can actually break this um Schwinger limit or this you know quantum vacuum and produce this um vacuum nonlinearities. Um and then you can use these resonance effects to actually pump the quantum vacuum to move move around in u in space if you have the right uh cavity. And that&#x27;s what you the shell of your craft needs to be this cavity. And you need to use these this four-wave mixing effect.</p>
<p>Um and the stuff that uh we talked about in you know all these recent YouTube missions including you know this is really boring. It&#x27;s difficult to get through but talks a a lot about the M drive and this NASA Impossible thruster and stuff. This is uh an interview that was on Tim Ventura talking with uh Roger Shyer. So M drive and uh this this P this thruster stuff. So very interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Um I think that it has to do with more with these cavities and and a redesign of this this uh this M M drive. I don&#x27;t think that the current um designs that they&#x27;re working with are um optimal. I think that, you know, they&#x27;re working with a lot of, you know, equations which they&#x27;re understanding on a very linear basis because that&#x27;s the only way, you know, humans can really understand a lot of this stuff. But the these resonant cavities can be spherical and often bell-shaped. And I think that um a re understanding of that that structure of the the resonance can um lead to further developments in the design of these um these these types of drive warp drives of the future.</p>
<p>And um yeah again uh look light as a dipole. That&#x27;s [music] interesting. No, I haven&#x27;t. Um, but yeah, let&#x27;s um let&#x27;s this is about this this stream is mostly going to be about Lou. So, I just wanted to talk about that whole fact.</p>
<p>Um, people can go to that interview that I showed here before. see this invisible college and how put off a part where he talks about it at 15 minutes and 43 seconds where he&#x27;s asked about it on this this interview. Go check that out. Um, we have to find the original thing that predates this uh June 23rd, 2021 presentation. I&#x27;m going to go and look for it and I&#x27;m going to find it.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t get it here. Obviously, no one sent it to me and no one found it, but I&#x27;m going to hunt for it this week and I&#x27;m going to find it and do the research. um where where Lou talks about the guy that brought him onto the ATIP project and that whole that that issue is key because whoever brought him onto that project this quintessential theoretical physicist or quantum physicist whatever he said um is the key person and you know he&#x27;s asked about it here he kind of dodges that question and talks about you know his the physicist that he does name is Hal put off kit green um Eric Davis and um calm Keller, right? Those are the four that he names. So, um, that&#x27;s cool. We&#x27;ve been there, done that.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve dug down a lot of these rabbit holes in the scientific, uh, sector on this channel and on Alien Scientist and and with some of the science, a lot of these guys haven&#x27;t come on here. Be cool. Maybe I should go and try to interview and talk to these guys because they, you know, that might be maybe is it worth my time? I don&#x27;t know. send me a super chat if you think it&#x27;s worth my time to to really dig into and and go after maybe some of these guys and interview them. But I think we&#x27;ve got a lot of the other scientists named and and you know there&#x27;s a lot more other interesting avenues of exploration with a lot of the other science going on that I have enough to keep me busy without digging down these rabbit holes which seem to be pretty well covered in the mainstream already.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of people are look have been looking into these researchers and the and the the NIDS research at Skinwalker Ranch. There&#x27;s a whole show about Skinwalker and a lot of people are looking into all that stuff. And um you know, there&#x27;s some interesting stuff there if you if you dig deep and know what you&#x27;re looking for, but to the average, you know, browser and an investigator, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to get d deep on the uh the legit anti-gravity research that we&#x27;re doing on APE and stuff. So, um, yeah, that&#x27;s pretty much all I got to say. And thank you to to Kurt for, um, asking questions for us, uh, to his guests on his channel.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s that&#x27;s always much appreciated and and it&#x27;s awesome because looking at this stuff in hindsight is is is key. Um, especially with, you know, all the recent revelations and arguments and and things going back and forth of what&#x27;s going on. I I I really think that ATIP um there&#x27;s much more scientific research and and stuff going on secretly behind the scenes than is really presented out there to the public and in the mainstream. And I talked about my views on that with the MJ12, which I think is bogus. And I think that the real um MJ, if I were going to write another name of 12 scientists that I I would have really suggested as part of an MJ12, it would be a lot different than the names on the list that were, you know, forward in these phony documents from Richard Dodie Falcon of the Aviary.</p>
<p>Um, but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s just my opinion after researching this and really digging into it hard and deep for 20 years. Um, and I encourage you to do the same if you really feel like you need to waste the time. But, you know, again, we&#x27;re here to help expediate your your process of of the information in ufology. And I encourage anyone who wants to challenge me on this stuff. Like, if I&#x27;m wrong, please, please, please, please, please correct me and please challenge me.</p>
<p>And I and I am open to debate. I&#x27;m open to discussion. I post the link in the description so people can join the StreamYard link and join. I&#x27;ll even post it right now in the live chat just to show you I&#x27;m serious. And this is the real information.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the best information. And um you can listen to Jeremy Corbell and watch Joe Rogan and all these other guys all you want, but you&#x27;re not going to get you&#x27;re not going to get super informed. I hate to break it to you. Uh we we dig into it here and if we&#x27;re wrong, I&#x27;m open to it. I I encourage people to come on and and just show me cuz we we want the best information.</p>
<p>We want the right information. We want accurate information on the show. And that&#x27;s really all I care about is is uh I don&#x27;t care about my ego at the end of the day. I&#x27;m happy to admit I was wrong about something. I will gladly eat my words.</p>
<p>You know, as people say, &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re going to be wrong when disclosure happens and and it&#x27;s all aliens and and you were wrong about all these secret government programs and all this stuff.&quot; I will eat my words gladly when aliens land and and and disclosure of any kind happens, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath. And um there&#x27;s so much more that requires a lot of work and effort on on on behalf of people out there that a lot of people aren&#x27;t willing to to put in and take to get to to disclosure. Oh, Renee. Is that really Renee?</p>
