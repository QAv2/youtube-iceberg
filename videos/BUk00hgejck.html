            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel we try to um shed light on some um theories of everything and uh all-encompassing theories theories can that can help you in your own life or approaches that can help you in your own life and uh especially in your with your Paradigm uh being able to have a holistic view of things and kind of uh be able to have one basket to put all your eggs in so to speak um that&#x27;s uh especially for uh Egyptian Tree of Life uh I&#x27;ve got um a few hundred videos on Egyptian tree of life and uh that has been something that for me uh I used it and uh I was able to kind of put all the other theories and and and all the other research and things I&#x27;ve studied in the past into that uh single basket you know so I was able to kind of integrate all of the disjointed stuff I had in my head and it kind of just um a it opened up a lot of uh energy that I was spending on you know trying to memorize stuff um and uh I think it also works for the reciprocal system of theory which is what we&#x27;re going to be talking about today today is the 339th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory and uh today we&#x27;re going to uh do a little bit of a departure um and we&#x27;re going to look at um some of the writings from Dr Bruce pet uh We&#x27;ve looked at quite a bit of his stuff before but uh this is his um kind of introduction to the rs2 theory okay so now dwey B Larson is the uh author or the originator of the reciprocal system and he put this together in you know the last over the last 60 years of his life from 1930 or so until uh his death in 1990 and um uh Dr Bruce Pratt kind of took over after Larson passed away and um along with Dr kbk neru created uh this thing called rs2 or reciprocal system 2 which was just like a re-evaluation of the reciprocal system um tweaking it um accepting most of it and accepting the spirit of the reciprocal system but um looking at individual areas where Larson might have come up short and uh and Larson understood that he was subject to error he believed that his theory itself self was correct but whether he was able to apply his theory in all cases uh was not uh guaranteed and that he may have made some mistakes in his kind of deduction of the theory uh from the theory and uh I I believe that he did and I believe that Dr Pratt and Dr neru did a bang-up job in kind of pinpointing some of the inaccuracies and uh proposing solutions that seem to be um kind of a lot more stable and sustainable so we&#x27;re going to be looking at uh this paper he calls rs211 so you know um this is 101 on rs2 he has 101 through 110 I believe and we&#x27;re going to look at several of those if not all of them uh this one is called rs2 101 is called creating a theory but I suppose before we do that we we just want to uh go through real quick about what is the reciprocal system of theory uh basically Larson in the reciprocal system is positing uh a universe of motion so the universe is not made out of matter not made out of energy or force or anything else but it is made out entirely out of motion and um not uh not exactly the textbook definition of motion but uh a form of motion that lson refers to as scalar motion this is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um I I&#x27;ll go over that a little bit later but um and for Larson motion was the relationship between space and time and we see that in you know something like speed or velocity that um uh speed is generally measured you know the car is moving at 20 M an hour going south if you want to make it velocity but um 20 M an hour 20 mi of space in 1 hour of time space over time is speed acceleration same way uh I dropped the rock out the window and it fell at 32 ft per second per second uh 32 ft of space and uh 1 second per second uh of Time s over t^ s it&#x27;s acceleration um energy um it took me uh 20 minutes to move that thing 20 ft 20 minutes of time and 20 ft of space that is energy time over space and so on and so forth all of our basic scientific quantities are relationships between space and time uh including matter and force and um pressure and uh capacitance and resistance and um electric current and electric charge and magnetic flux and permeability and permitivity and fluidity and osity all of these are different uh relationships between space and time and um there is a few other uh caveats to the reciprocal system that lson lays out in his his uh First Fundamental postulate he has two fundamental postulates U uh pet will be going over them in this paper here but um um one is that um space and time both have space and time do not have independent existence they only exist together in motion and um motion is basically a fraction uh with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator this is not a normal form of motion this again is scalar motion uh which lar Larson refers to as clock time and clock space uh the clock time we generally understand the clock is always getting later and later and later and later uh but but in no specific Direction uh clock space is that the space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart um but in no specific Direction you would think of this like you would think of um you can model this with a a balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all of the dots are moving away from each other but in no specific Direction in fact you don&#x27;t get any type of specific Direction until you assign a reference point once you say that okay this dot we&#x27;re going to say that this dot is motionless then once you do that then you can impute a direction to the various movements there okay the this dot is moving away from our reference point in north and this dot is moving away from our reference Point North by Northwest um but if you if you don&#x27;t assign a reference so the direction is due to the reference point not due to the motion itself and um if you don&#x27;t pick the reference point um then it&#x27;s basically that all the dots are moving away from each other but not only that but even just the locations that aren&#x27;t dots you know those are also moving away from each other so everything in it&#x27;s basically that the space itself is moving away from uh from each other every spot is moving away from every other spot and that was also observed by the Hubble telescope that observed that all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other um unless we can ass want to assume that our galaxy is at the center of the universe and is Motionless then we would have to also say that our galaxy is moving away from each one of the other galaxies so that is a scalar motion what Larson refers to as clock space and then there is coordinate space and coordinate time and Larson uh you know we generally recognize coordinate space three dimensions of space XYZ coordinates but then we also have uh coordinate time that is three dimensions of time and uh that is General blasphemy to most of your legacy scientists um but it occurs in certain circumstances in larsson&#x27;s universe and then also space and time come in only discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time if you don&#x27;t have a minimum unit then you don&#x27;t have space or you don&#x27;t have time so you have to have a full unit if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time remembering that space over time is speed one unit of space and one one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is what Larson calls unit speed 1 over 1 equals 1 and at unit speed uh he basically says that this is uh what he calls the progression of the natural reference system so this is this is how uh n nature measures in this universe of motion uh the speed of light is basically the origin or the midpoint or the null point or the uh The Ether the uh reference point of this universe and half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light as well as half the universe moving slower than the speed of light and uh this makes sense in a universe of motion in a universe of motion motion is the fundamental thing and it is the first thing and so in order to be able to accept uh or even consider the reciprocal system you have to be able to uh Envision motion without any thing moving or any object moving there is no object the object itself is made out of motion and that comes later first you have just the motion uh and no no thing moving and um again in a universe of motion that is the most fundamental thing and so you have to be able to let go of the object uh idea and and uh then um you know Einstein is basically saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson is saying it is the midpoint of the universe and he&#x27;s using a reciprocal system which is a multiplicative system as opposed to the additive system of the Legacy scientists the Legacy scientists are measuring from zero and they&#x27;re measuring plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 and minus one - 2 minus 3 um but in Larson system you start with one the speed of light and you go one 2 3 4 and you on the other side you go one 1/2 1/3 and 1/4 so they multiply to make one as opposed to adding to make zero um and so this is basically meaning that uh Einstein and his crowd um they only perceive half the universe half of the universe is eliminated through his dictum that everything uh the speed of light is the maximum speed um and they&#x27;re missing the the speed the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light which is what Larson refers to as the cosmic sector and um fortunately for those people they can make up the difference quickly because what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector is exactly what&#x27;s going on in the material sector except that they are reciprocals and so you have to reverse the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have three dimensions of space and you coordinate space and you have clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of time and you have clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh generally um you know in both sectors you have you know matter you have material matter and you have uh what Larson calls Cosmic matter which is what the Legacy scientists would refer to as antimatter um okay so that&#x27;s kind of how it goes uh now when we go over Dr Pet&#x27;s paper here he will explain probably that and much more in this paper so we&#x27;ll get started today I hopefully we&#x27;ll be able to get through this first one in two days maybe three okay uh rs211 creating a theory framework a frame is a supporting structure that is used to construct something more complicated this could be a frame of a house to support the walls and ceiling or the frame of a picture to support the photo in order to construct a theory we must build the frame to support that Theory&#x27;s construction since the reciprocal system is a theory that attempts to describe behavior in nature the underlying framework is defined by the laws of nature so this section is called natural law natural law is nothing more than an observation on the way nature behaves an observation nature will always do its own thing regardless of how mankind would like like it to behave nature&#x27;s laws are static in that they always work the same way uh even uh that that they always work the same way regardless of how uh how smart The Observer is by observing nature we can codify the way it behaves using a number of different tools and techn uh and techniques such as mathematics music physics and chemistry but once we do that we have left natural law and have created our own set of laws man&#x27;s law so this section is called man&#x27;s law man&#x27;s law is a commandment on how things are to behave and this applies to all fields the laws of mathematics the laws of physics and even the laws of civilization civil laws man&#x27;s law is dynamic in that it changes as man learns however due to influences of ego these changes do not imply that man&#x27;s law actually becomes a better or closer approximation of nature it can get far off track uh this section is called realities realities as can be seen there are two Frameworks the natural one that a theory is trying to describe and the theory uh description itself in rs2 we are going to use the terms natural and artificial to represent the natural framework of observation and the artificial framework of theory describing the observations a simple way to distinguish the two is to determine if a statement is an observation or a commandment photons move at the speed of light an observation natural half your salary goes to taxes commandment artificial gold has value observation natural Federal Reserve notes and Euros have value commandment artificial nature can be observed but not commanded artificial realities are Commandments observed as quote illusions so natural reality let&#x27;s start with some basic observations of nature first the minimum quantity you can have of anything is one you cannot possess none of something nor can you have a part of something because the part in itself constitutes one part this is the concept of a discrete unit even when you bust something into pieces each piece is a discrete unit and a quantity of one you can continue to break things apart until you reach an indivisible unit the building block of nature we call the atom on the other hand you can have more than one but you can never have it all I can pick 10 apples from a tree but I can never pick every Apple in the universe the maximum quantity though very large is always finite in the natural framework there is no Infinity you either have it or you don&#x27;t and if you have it you have some finite amount of it the natural framework is based on quantities amounts of ma or magnitudes the quantity is represented symbolically by cardinal numbers or scalar magnitudes another observation is that the things in nature that the things in nature constantly change yet remain the same the atoms of a rock may break into dust but the atoms are still atoms those same atoms can aggregate back into another rock but the atoms are still atoms the building blocks of nature remain constant but the arrangement of these building blocks constantly change these building blocks the content of the universe appear to have different properties than that of the container they are inside so we have two apparently different things that are inexorably joined yet separate and that joining is dynamic change in nature we can describe change as the relationship between the content and the container natural quantities work like the Christian calendar where there is no year zero When you subtract a year from 1 a you end up at 1 BC when you have a natural quantity of one and you remove that one you end up with one missing and a minus one and start counting in the downward Direction you can never have none since like the Christian C calendar there is no concept of zero artificial reality artificial reality to understand the artificial reality created by man one must understand a bit about psychology and Consciousness particularly the point of the point of Consciousness that tiny person that sits in a chair behind your eyeballs with the joystick driving your body around the world everything this guy sees is relative to him he is the center of the universe and everything extends outward in order to deal with the external world he needs a reality that includes the concept of himself as a center or zero zero of course does not exist in the natural world a around him in the natural world around him so he he designs a personal framework to include the concept to include the concept of zero an artificial reality in the Mind&#x27;s Eye everything is always relative to that point of Consciousness which views amounts as an ordered series a measurement from itself expressed symbolically through ordinal numbers I&#x27;m first you&#x27;re second he&#x27;s third she&#x27;s forth Etc sequences are relative amounts when we say something like first in line there is an assumption that the line starts somewhere a zero and we are one unit from that zero if you have zero you can have none so what about not none here enters the other end of the measurement that which goes beyond the natural ability of counting in of counting Infinity the concept is straightforward zero is the center and means none Infinity is the extreme and means all when someone says the universe is infinite all they are saying is that the universe is all there is nothing mystical about it all artificial realities are the product of human imagination and are unique to a natural person that person Einstein Larson whomever then shares this reality with others and if accepted be forms a consensus a theory is just an artificial reality that has been proposed for consensus okay I think we&#x27;re going to uh stop right there and we will uh okay we&#x27;re going to read uh two more paragraphs here consensus like reality consensus has its natural and artificial Expressions natural consensus is an agreement of observations this is a rock yep it is natural consensus is made as a knowing and conscious conscious Act of consent artificial consensus is a product of socialization namely education through coercion you are informed that a particular artificial reality is the truth and if you do not accept it you&#x27;re going to stay where you are until you do it is a necessary element of society that we all all agree to certain social norms however most coerced cons uh consensus realities tend to expand in complexity and misunderstanding until there is little resemblance to the Natural reality it was originally derived from Once a consensus reaches a point where it can no longer be observed in nature then people start to challenge it and work to create new consensus and this is not limited to science it also applies to religion metaphysics politics economics and other I you care to mention any other I you care to mention okay uh we&#x27;re going to stop there and and um we&#x27;ll take over tomorrow with a section that is called Dewey larsson&#x27;s artificial reality okay um thanks for tuning in today and uh come back tomorrow to hear the second part of this paper and have a great day</p>
