            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m Megan Kelly. Welcome to the Megan Kelly show. Later today, David Gush will be here as we dive into the topic of UFOs or UAPs as they&#x27;re now called and a bombshell new movie on disclosure. Is the big disclosure coming soon? Is all of this just a prelude to a big admission directly from those in charge? But we begin today with the political landscape as Secretary of State Marco Rubio&#x27;s stock appears to be on the rise. We are seeing meltdowns from Governor Wals in Minnesota and from the new head of the quote office to protect tenants in Mayor Zoran Mani&#x27;s administration in New York.</p>
<p>This woman who we told you about yesterday who hates white people who own property. Uh you&#x27;ll be shocked to learn she&#x27;s a total hypocrite and she got caught on camera by I think both the Daily Mail and the New York Post this morning and she cried and ran back into to her her apartment. So she&#x27;s not ready for prime time. We&#x27;ll show you the pictures. You can&#x27;t run around calling white people who own homes racist and say you have plans to devastate the white middle class or the middle class period and not expect a little blowback, sweetheart, when you become an administrative official for the greatest city in America.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Many people are crying in the news today. We will not be two of them. Um, it&#x27;s insane. I guess we should start there. She&#x27;s a nutcase, this woman, CIA Weaver.</p>
<p>Um, not only did we see the reporting that we brought to the audience yesterday from X on what a lunatic this woman is, but now, um, Unheard has released additional tweets of hers and comments of hers that just double down on the nuttiness. This woman does not appear to be very well. I mean, that&#x27;s my only real take here. Like, something needs to be done about her. I&#x27;m going to kick it off by showing her.</p>
<p>Um, okay, let&#x27;s see. Oh, this is what she thinks should happen. This is just from October with our PTAs in New York. PTAs, which, you know, I&#x27;m a parent. Uh, the PTA worries about like teacher gifts around Christmas, uh, fundraisers for the school, and like social dances for the children.</p>
<p>Not according to CIA Weaver. They have bigger things on their plate. She thinks S22, &gt;&gt; we should really look to what uh Brandon Johnson and as well as the Chicago Teachers Union is doing to really use the schools and the city as sites of resistance against the federal incursion. If you&#x27;re comfortable in your coalition, you&#x27;re not willing you&#x27;re not winning power. If the if ICE and the National Guard are coming to New York City, ICE is already here.</p>
<p>If the National Guard is coming on January 1st, which we know they are, we really have to use our tenant associations and our parent teacher associations and our public schools as like networks of defense um in support of ZR&#x27;s agenda and um and in support of our neighbors. Okay. So, the PTA needs to be first line of defense against ICE. Um I&#x27;m looking forward to that in New York City. that&#x27;s going to go swimmingly well.</p>
<p>As all of this comes up, she sits down for a radio interview on uh I think it was ABC. Yeah, it was a Spectrum Spectrum News yesterday and she is asked about Mayor Adams outgoing the out the now former mayor of New York about some of his criticism of her lunacy like property is theft, moving to the suburbs is structural racism. You&#x27;re not allow not allowed to live in the suburbs, Mark. Um, by the way, she lives in a totally gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood. She is one of the white people who moved into a minority neighborhood and paid too much money, thus increasing the rental and the real estate values, which is racist.</p>
<p>And now, the Daily Mail reveals that her mother lives in a $1.4 4 million home down in Nashville and is a teacher at Vandy Vanderbilt University and uh is a gentifier herself. So, she&#x27;s a hypocrite and she gets asked about some of her comments and like her home ownership is white supremacy comment on this Salem or Spectrum interview on Tuesday. Here&#x27;s how that went. Saw 23B. &gt;&gt; The former mayor Eric Adams said that you were quote out of your effing mind.</p>
<p>That was in response to a resurfaced tweet from way back when of something you&#x27;d said on Twitter about home ownership being a tool of white supremacy. I wanted to give you a chance to respond. You&#x27;re not you&#x27;re not out of your mind, right? &gt;&gt; I I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m out of my mind. Um you know, I think that some of some of those things are are certainly not how I would how I would say things today and are and are regretful. Um but, you know, I do think my sort of decades of experience fighting for more affordable housing sort of stands on its own.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m proud to be in this role fighting for stronger tenants rights and and I think that for many years people have been locked out of the property market that has produced a lot of systemic and racial inequalities in our system and um I want to make sure that everybody has a safe and affordable place to live whether they rent or own and that is something that I&#x27;m laser focused on in this new role. &gt;&gt; Okay. So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a timing issue Mark. She she wouldn&#x27;t say those things these days, but you know, she was young and naive back in like 2020, right, &gt;&gt; when she described America KKKA as an apartheid state and called for defunding the NYPD. Um, also said white people, white people, and corporate Dems, who are also white people, were the problem after Donald Trump was elected.</p>
<p>Um, and then of course in 2018 called for ICE to be abolished. So she doesn&#x27;t want cops. She doesn&#x27;t want ICE. And in the notsodistant past also said that she celebrated the government&#x27;s sacred right to seize property and appeared to call for the abolition of not just quote abusive landlordism but private property in general. This is not when she was in middle school.</p>
<p>This is just a couple of years ago. Mark Halpern. So what are we to make of CIA Weaver? &gt;&gt; I mean I think three things about the matter of CIA Weaver Enriia Weaver. First um when somebody says, &quot;Oh, these were regrettable.&quot; Like the reporter should say, &quot;Let&#x27;s walk through it. This is not a million years ago.&quot; What do you what do you regret about it? So she&#x27;s got a PR adviser telling her to say they&#x27;re regrettable and think she can move on.</p>
<p>Number two, how could she have gotten through a job interview? And I&#x27;m not not just talking about the vetting of all these of all these public statements. I&#x27;m talking about competence and the question of uh of of of this mayor trying to prove himself that he&#x27;s going to know how to run this city. How could she have survived a job interview? I don&#x27;t get that. And then lastly is just her demeanor freaks me out. I&#x27;ll be honest about it.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s just something about her demeanor that is really un unsettling to me. And uh as a resident of New York, I plan to go go cover her if she stays in the job. But, uh, this is just it&#x27;s just he&#x27;s off to such a I saw a story, several stories saying he&#x27;s off to a fast start. I don&#x27;t know what else he&#x27;s doing, but but this lady is uh is uh two anchors hang handcuffed around his ankles uh if he&#x27;s trying to get off to a fast start. &gt;&gt; Yes, her demeanor freaks me out, too.</p>
<p>And I I I&#x27;m going to overrule her PR advisor and give her some real PR advice, and she should actually listen to me. Um, first of all, you desperately need, see, a little eyebrow pencil. It doesn&#x27;t have to be excessively heavy, but you need to put some over your eyes. They&#x27;re already very sunken to begin with. Something to define the space as where the eyes are would be helpful.</p>
<p>And in that same uh genre, you should add a little mascara. Just a little. I mean, if we&#x27;re really going to be honest, some bronzer and some lip gloss also would be your friends. Um, I also have to talk to her about the crying. It&#x27;s important, Mark.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve been in the public eye. You&#x27;ve been dragged many times. It&#x27;s a brutal business. They will take your worst moments. They will use them against you.</p>
<p>They will tell the world you&#x27;re a terrible, terrible person. Whether you are or you aren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s sad, but it&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s life as a public figure these days. Well, Porcia got caught by the Daily Mail and the New York Post outside of her gentrified place in Brooklyn. And instead of just saying, &quot;Guys, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>I spoke to this on Spectrum News or go home. She cried, Mark. She cried. &gt;&gt; You know what I call her now? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s all over the Daily Mail. &gt;&gt; I call her I call her sad sea.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sadia. She cried on camera with the Daily Mail in the New York Post. And then she ran back inside her apartment. She She cried and ran. This is a no.</p>
<p>It I mean, no matter how bad it gets, right? I I like I I the the whole press was telling the world that I was a pedophile lover two months ago. Did I cry? No. It&#x27;s called being in the public eye. They say terrible things about you. In C&#x27;s case, it happens just to be a resurfacing of her actual words.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s fine. But you don&#x27;t cry and you don&#x27;t run inside when the Daily Mail shoves a camera in your face. &gt;&gt; It doesn&#x27;t bode well for the long-term prospering of Sad Sea. Uh I do have a sound effect for Sad Sea when she cries. Yeah, that&#x27;s my sad CIA sound effect.</p>
<p>Every time she cries, I&#x27;m gonna just pump that out on social media. &gt;&gt; It works. Your sad trombone because it&#x27;s somewhat reminiscent of the Charlie Brown &gt;&gt; teacher. &gt;&gt; And she looks just kind of like a Charlie Brown figure with like &gt;&gt; illdefined features and just a round super white face. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And just and just slit black slits for eyes. &gt;&gt; She doesn&#x27;t have a the other thing. Okay, so here&#x27;s a little bit more on her from the Daily Mail. The privileged former Binmar College student, of course, of course she is. Her stunning hypocrisy was uncovered by the Daily Mail on Wednesday when we revealed her mother owned a gorgeous craftsman home in Nashville worth 1.4 million.</p>
<p>The Tennessee City is America&#x27;s fastest gentrifying. So, it&#x27;s not just gentrification. It&#x27;s the fastest gentrifying that her mother lives in. So, I guess she thinks her mother&#x27;s a racist. But Weaver gave no indication to her family wealth and has now refused to say whether she will ask her mother to give up her private property and also would not say what she&#x27;s going to do if she inherits the mother&#x27;s gentrified home uh in Nashville.</p>
<p>Weaver lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, a historically black neighborhood whose longtime residents have also been priced out by white newcomers. Uh and on and on it goes. Now, she&#x27;s deleted her ex account and her uh Facebook account as well where uh Unheard got to some of the posts that I kicked the segment off with. And I&#x27;m sorry, Mark. I don&#x27;t know what Mayor Mum Donnie does of with this.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t seem to care and maybe his voters won&#x27;t care either, but he&#x27;s in for a hot mess of stories with this person in charge of tenant housing who thinks government seizure of property is a great thing and that whites need to be deprived of their homes, at least if they&#x27;re in the middle class. &gt;&gt; Sad Sea has some regrets. Let&#x27;s see how long she stays in this position. Uh the mayor doesn&#x27;t seem inclined to get rid of her. Uh but I suspect uh she may not have deleted her MySpace account yet, and that&#x27;s where people will head next to see what&#x27;s on there for Sad Sea.</p>
<p>I mean, again, the stuff is laughable, but I I continue to wonder about this mayor. This is not the only personnel decision he&#x27;s made. Some having to do with past controversial statements and unacceptable statements, but some of it is just people who aren&#x27;t qualified. And and hypocrisy is unattractive and and I think we&#x27;ll learn more about the life and times of Sadia and and she could she could she should explain this stuff. The lack of explanation, I think, is is why is why this story will persist.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, and she can&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s not the timing. It&#x27;s not that she was this young errant child making these comments. Here&#x27;s one from March of 2024. All right.</p>
<p>Not even a year ago when she spoke to uh Sam Seder on the majority report s 23. &gt;&gt; The mechanisms for acquiring distressed housing could look different on a building by building basis. In some cases, what happens is tenants form a tenant association. They have a scoff landlord or someone who&#x27;s not making repairs and they could pressure um you know using organizing tactics. They could pressure to the social housing development authority to take over their homes to buy their homes.</p>
<p>In other cases, it might happen through like a legal process. A couple days ago, one of the most notorious slumlords in the city um uh his name is Ob Shalom. He was arrested because he is treating his tenants so badly. hundreds of thousands of open code violations. In cases like that where the city is actively pursuing already sort of litigation and enforcement mechanisms against the landlord, the SHDA is an option.</p>
<p>We can say, &quot;Hey, um, you know, you are not maintaining this building and we are the city of New York. We have an interest in making sure that housing is wellmaintained and and we&#x27;re going to take this building away from you.&quot; &gt;&gt; Okay, that&#x27;s going to be a real hit with the Landlords of New York, Mark. Well, there&#x27;s a big New York Times piece about her and it quotes one real estate person who&#x27;s her friend favorably. Uh, but I suspect that that was a bit of an outlier and uh it&#x27;s going to be interesting. The real estate industry is super powerful, one of the super most powerful lobbyists in in this city and players in this city.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s going to be interesting to see. Um, and I thought you showed awesome self-restraint and not commenting on how her hair looks in that clip. I mean, that is how my hair looks when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed. But this is not what you how you give an interview. Sea, please, for the love of God.</p>
<p>You know what? We have something exciting that we&#x27;re going to be starting on the MK Media podcast network soon. Mark Halprin, I have I&#x27;ll announce it shortly. I don&#x27;t want to give it away just yet, but it it can involve CIA. I could do some real good for this gal. She would just put herself in my good hands.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, she would have to quit her job first because she&#x27;s I can&#x27;t help her as she&#x27;s behaving like a devil. Um, by the way, she when she ran inside of her home chased by the Daily Mail, they noted that she has a free Palestine poster taped to one of its windows. Okay, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s on brand. And um, it reminded me her $ 1.4 million mother&#x27;s house and her nice home in the gentrified Crown Heights area of Brooklyn that um, when Zora Mumani, socialist, got sworn in along with his socialist wife, she was wearing boots that reportedly cost $650. It doesn&#x27;t feel very socialisty.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m pretty sure because I just went on Amazon to get new winter boots for my kids. And you can definitely get nice ones for 60 bucks on Amazon. Like really good ones that you can be outside in Montana in. So I&#x27;m pretty sure you can be in Manhattan with something less than $650 boots if in fact you&#x27;re a true socialist.</p>
<p>Mark Halprin. But all of these people are This is an act for show as as is wokeism in general to try to make you feel like you&#x27;re better than other people. &gt;&gt; You know the old the old phrase limousine liberal. I call these sumptuous socialists. &gt;&gt; Sumptuous social.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It makes sense. &gt;&gt; So I mean what do we do other than call them out on the hypocrisy like the homes and the boots? &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s see if she can do the job. You know, I suspect given her demeanor and her rhetoric uh and her attitude that it may government service may turn out not to be uh everything she&#x27;s dreamed of of doing. Uh and let&#x27;s see, a lot of what they want to do on housing will require the help of the governor who is a bit of a mess but not a socialist. Um and so let let&#x27;s see how long she&#x27;s there.</p>
<p>She may be available for your new surprise program before too long. Now, um, speaking of crying, we have to talk about the new anchor of CBS Evening News. There there&#x27;s no crying in evening news. There there might be some crying when a president is shot and assassinated right before your very eyes like we saw with Walter Kankite, though he didn&#x27;t. There was like a wiping of the eyes when he took off the glasses to report that JFK had been shot and killed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; As far as &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s as far as he went. That&#x27;s as far as most evening news anchors would ever have gone traditionally. It&#x27;s the dawn of a new day. I&#x27;m going to get to the incredible tape.</p>
<p>Like I literally could not believe my eyes, but I&#x27;m going to set it up first. Okay. Tony Dokapool is the new CBS evening anchor. And I&#x27;ve got to be honest, I believe he got the role because he gave um what&#x27;s his name? Tana Hissy Coats a challenging interview on CBS Mornings about his 10 days in Israel where he then declared himself an expert which was a ridiculous proposition and no one had been challenging him and Tony did a good job of that and Barry is very very pro-Israel trust me I&#x27;m aware because she just blew up our friendship over it and even though I&#x27;m an Israel supporter and she hired him she liked what he did in that interview I&#x27;m telling you and that&#x27;s why he got this job it was over that interview on on Israel so okay he does a good job on Israel But now he comes in and he says,&quot;I get it. I&#x27;m one of you.&quot; And he gave this whole thing about, you know, how I&#x27;m going to be listening to you, not the ex experts.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s honestly not the answer. Just just follow the facts, please. You know, like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not that you need the the common viewer to tell you what the news is. You are too reliant on experts in mainstream news. That&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>But like the facts are what matters. It&#x27;s not it&#x27;s so pandery to say like, &quot;I&#x27;m just going to listen to you and do what you tell me.&quot; That&#x27;s that&#x27;s not it either. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re scrambling. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re desperate for viewers. They&#x27;re not going to get them.</p>
<p>The era of the evening news anchor is over. Um so nobody says it better, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, than Adam Corolla, who is such an astute observer of the media business and of life and of America. And he went on a tear yesterday in response to this Tony Dokapool like, &quot;Oh gee, I&#x27;m no more experts, just you. And I&#x27;m going to listen. and I too have shared near frustrations, none of which is evidenced by his own coverage over the years.</p>
<p>By the way, he&#x27;s he doesn&#x27;t sound like a frustrated I can&#x27;t stand the mainstream news media anchor at all. Um, but here&#x27;s Adam Corolla responding to that bit, which we played yesterday on the show, but now here&#x27;s Adam&#x27;s response. S28. &gt;&gt; So, he&#x27;s going to explain to us with all these stories what happened. &gt;&gt; Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop or the president&#x27;s fitness for office.</p>
<p>The point is on too many stories, the press has missed the story because we&#x27;ve taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. &gt;&gt; All right, pause there. That&#x27;s fine. You didn&#x27;t miss the story. You lied about the story.</p>
<p>And yes, you did listen to advocates. &gt;&gt; By the way, you&#x27;re not supposed to listen to advocates. You&#x27;re supposed to go do the research and crunch the numbers, not listen to people who work for this organization or that organization who have an agenda. You don&#x27;t need to talk to the average American either. You need you&#x27;re a news organization.</p>
<p>Does CO kill healthy kids? No. Okay, we got OUR ANSWER. GO DO SOME  WORK. &gt;&gt; DON&#x27;T TALK TO ME. Let&#x27;s go do some journalisming.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I love him so much. your thoughts on that, too. &gt;&gt; I like the phrase journalism. Journalisming. Is that what he said? Journalisming.</p>
<p>Um, &gt;&gt; like as a verb? Yeah. &gt;&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen the show yet, so I I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t know what exactly they&#x27;re doing on the show. Uh, I I don&#x27;t get this uh this uh move towards the notion of we&#x27;re going to talk to normal ordinary people. At the same time, uh, as you you and I both know, uh, all wisdom is not found in New York and Washington.</p>
<p>So, if they can find a way to to infuse the the journalism with a conception of what&#x27;s really going on in the country, I&#x27;m all for that. Uh, but I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t understand the the sort of concept of we&#x27;re going to listen to what you want on the show or or whatever it is they mean. I I I want to see how it plays out, but I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t get it. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something, that is  pandering. That&#x27;s what that was by Tony Dogapool.</p>
<p>Like, I&#x27;m going to be listening to you, you know, I&#x27;m not going to be like these other guys. um that his coverage prior to taking this role does not support that he does that at all and no one was making him be a biased leftist in the tank for leftist ideals. He&#x27;s married to MSNBC&#x27;s Katie Tur which tells us a lot. First of all, um here he is. We just pulled went back just did a brief search to see how he covered some of the more controversial stories that have been in the news over the past few years.</p>
<p>This is September 21st, 2021. Talking about the alleged incident in which the very mean bad border patrol whipped the Haitian migrants crossing the border. Watch. &gt;&gt; Images along the border are shocking and the bar is high for shocking images along the border. You&#x27;ve called them horrific.</p>
<p>What did the president say? How did he feel when he saw them? &gt;&gt; He also felt they were horrific and horrible. I don&#x27;t know anyone who could watch that video and not have that emotion. &gt;&gt; That looks like &gt;&gt; this was more than 24 hours after it had broken that these were very questionable images and the Reuters photographer was already saying that&#x27;s not what they showed. But they ran with it. Tony Dokapool got on there, set it up with Jen Saki.</p>
<p>Shocking. Horrific. That was the misinformation they fed to their viewers. But now now he wants to say it was all about the trust of experts, Mark. and he&#x27;s going to be the one to correct that imbalance.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I looked like that lady from MSNBC a little bit, pardon me, MS Now on there. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Uh, look, and you you know this as well as anyone, the the way to uh succeed as a communicator is to be true to what of who you really are and what you believe and to be consistent. And he&#x27;s going to have to explain as he goes forward if he does want to build trust, which is what he, you know, what they claim they want to do, he&#x27;s going to have to explain moments like that and how they&#x27;re consistent with the notion of of the current ethos that they&#x27;re espousing or it&#x27;s not going to work.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He ran into the leftist narrative because it was negative about Trump. He ran to it as has his network from the start of Trump&#x27;s emergence as a national political figure. So there is zero reason to believe that the new I&#x27;m listening to you the common man Tony Dokapul is going to do any better. And by the way it&#x27;s all the same producers there who have been there and those are the ones who really generate the content. The anchor in that role is more of just a presenter.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. CBS has always been a producer driven uh news division as compared to some other places as opposed as you said to correspondent and anchor. And you know, they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve fired some people, some people have gone, but I absolutely agree with you. Unless they uh determine who&#x27;s ready to be a fair-minded person and run a different kind of shop, the the uh the vision that David Allison and Barry Weiss have laid out, it&#x27;s not going to be realized. &gt;&gt; So, back to Adam Corolla, who had further thoughts on why newsrooms, and you&#x27;ve worked in a lot of them, have deteriorated so and in particular gone woke.</p>
<p>Watch. &gt;&gt; Women are women first. Guys can separate. Shall we cover Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop? No, we should not. Why not? That&#x27;s a news story.</p>
<p>It hurts our guy, right? &gt;&gt; And we hate the other guy. So, it&#x27;s gynofascism. We took women who are emotional and that&#x27;s good for raising kids and it&#x27;s good for many things. It might be good for ratings for a while. It&#x27;s not good for journalism.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. He&#x27;s not wrong. He&#x27;s not wrong that like the feminization of the approach to news did open a door to wokeism. It did like lead with your heart.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all about empathy as opposed to just like what are the facts? The facts are biological sex is biological sex and you cannot change it. That&#x27;s just one example. Okay. But here is where I I am going to challenge my friend Adam. It is not just women who have feminized newsrooms.</p>
<p>And here is where the crying I promised you comes in. Tony Dookapool is trying to promote his new role as the evening news anchor, you know, in what was once Dan Rather&#x27;s dad shoes and and before that, Walter Kankite. And this video, I didn&#x27;t ask for this video, Mark Halprin. I was watching Twitter, watching X, and you know how you play one video and it if if it expires, another one just plays. That is how this came to me.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re stalking his social media. They put this out to promote his new role as the CBS Evening News anchor. And Adam Corolla, you want to talk feminization of the newsroom? I give you the new CBS Evening News anchor in a clip he&#x27;s promoting. &gt;&gt; You said this is your favorite place in the world. Why? Why South Florida and Miami? What? It makes me emotional.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so funny. I I didn&#x27;t mean I didn&#x27;t think it would catch it, you know. &gt;&gt; Crying &gt;&gt; cuz you only have one child, right? So, &gt;&gt; let me get a second here. &gt;&gt; Wiping his eye. &gt;&gt; I can relate.</p>
<p>This is home. &gt;&gt; Now his other eye. Now his first eye again. &gt;&gt; People will to help people understand why I have such a reaction. Now his other eye is where I grew up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; First eye again. &gt;&gt; We didn&#x27;t get a lot of sleep. So &gt;&gt; second eye. &gt;&gt; Yeah. My grandmother&#x27;s here and my father, my mother, my aunts and uncles, cousins, and it&#x27;s where I would have spent all of my childhood, but we left uh because of my father.</p>
<p>He got into trouble with business. like we laugh about it now, but he was a drug dealer. But the reason it&#x27;s so emotional for me is because I feel like I was robbed of the full &gt;&gt; Miami experience. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So when I come back, I&#x27;ve always like &gt;&gt; My god.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh my god. I know. It&#x27;s a no. It&#x27;s a no. Mark Halper, I thought for sure that story was going to end in and they were all killed in a houseire.</p>
<p>I was the sole survivor. in which case I would have excused the multiple tears that preceded it. It turns out the dad had some problems. I&#x27;m sorry to hear it. The the sobbing, the repeated the voice quivering, the inability to recover.</p>
<p>What is that? &gt;&gt; First of all, guy&#x27;s got hella good hair. So, I give him I give him that. Um, look, uh, it&#x27;s the fact that they put it out because I don&#x27;t begrudge anybody crying over their family. I cry when I talk about my family sometimes. You do too.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t put it out. &gt;&gt; You would never cry like that on the air. You lie. You&#x27;re just being nice. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m saying I wouldn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Well, I might. But I wouldn&#x27;t. But my point is it wasn&#x27;t live. They chose to put it out. The point you made originally, I don&#x27;t know why they why they chose to put it out.</p>
<p>It just &gt;&gt; and and the and the feminization of news, you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in business, it&#x27;s in universities, uh it&#x27;s in the law. Uh and and it is a it&#x27;s a fascinating topic. And and again, uh you don&#x27;t need to publish everything. You can you can record something and then put that on the shelf. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>It I&#x27;m not going to name this person, but it it reminded me after Charlie was killed, there was a certain news anchor who put out a clip. She&#x27;s not on the air anymore. She does I mean, she&#x27;s not on the the television airwave. She does what we do now. And she put out a clip and she promoted it on X literally saying, &quot;Here I am crying.&quot; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; On the news of Charlie Kirk. What the hell? Who does that? Who&#x27;s like, &quot;Here, look at me cry.&quot; That it&#x27;s so manipulative and weird. &gt;&gt; Now, I I cried live, but I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t publish anything after the fact. Yeah, I hear you. Um uh I also like the this thing.</p>
<p>I like the left, the right, the left, right &gt;&gt; over and over. &gt;&gt; Good technique. Don&#x27;t Don&#x27;t publish it. Put Put it on a hard drive. That&#x27;s of course he loved it.</p>
<p>He that you know at CBS they were like it shows your personality. It shows heart. You know to me it shows you&#x27;re feminine. You&#x27;re effeminite. You&#x27;re not tough.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not grizzled. You don&#x27;t strike me as a shoe leather reporter which is what I want in my evening news anchor. But let&#x27;s be honest. Let&#x27;s be fair to Tony. You got a guy over at ABC who&#x27;s putting the clothes pins on the back of his fake fireman&#x27;s jacket so he can look like a fireman when he goes to cover the floods.</p>
<p>David Mure who&#x27;s much more worried about the size of his waist than he is the accuracy of his broadcast. And if I&#x27;m being totally honest, Mark Halpern before, you know, Norah O&#x27;Donnell and and whoever preceded her, nobody knows who the hell&#x27;s been in that anchor chair for a while now. Dan Rather, he was also obsessed with his looks. the the this infamous clip of him worrying about his damn jacket and whether he&#x27;s going to wear the collar up or wear the collar down tells us a lot about the state of evening news even before this guy got to the desk. Remember this &gt;&gt; the question is whether we can do it without the coat.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hi folks find out Jeff would prefer to do it without the coat. It&#x27;s going to be cold but &gt;&gt; good. You know what? The green is good. Is it not the light? &gt;&gt; Green is good. Okay.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t need a scarf. &gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t need a scarf. Don&#x27;t think so. Now, let&#x27;s try it without it. If we wear the coat between now and then, &gt;&gt; I think that we&#x27;re going to be all right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Good. Good. Cuz that looks very Now, does that look good? &gt;&gt; It looks just a little uh little hot on this side, Tom. But &gt;&gt; we The broadcast is not for another 45 minutes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. So, &gt;&gt; temperature wind will be up and the temperature will be down. Yes. &gt;&gt; What do you think? &gt;&gt; But it looks so wind blown this way. I mean, I think the looks fine.</p>
<p>I agree with you, coach. &gt;&gt; Subtle. on it again. &gt;&gt; But what do you think? &gt;&gt; If you do, if you wear the coat, put take the collar down. &gt;&gt; Definitely not.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You want the collar up? &gt;&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen this in years. &gt;&gt; Nobody wears trench coat. I think I think we ought to try to do it without it. Okay. That&#x27;s what I honestly think.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I honestly think. &gt;&gt; The vanity. That&#x27;s really what these jobs have turned into. just an exercise in vanity, which is the least attractive quality, especially in a man. I&#x27;m sorry, but it is like m you know, if if you look at that clip, maybe they&#x27;re spot on in picking this guy for the role.</p>
<p>More crying, more more worrying about, you know, the poor whipped Haitians telling lies. Just as long as you look empathetic and soft. &gt;&gt; Do you not do you not have the John Edwards clip of him doing his hair? That&#x27;s the best. You know that one? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s another one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, of course. That&#x27;s a good one. &gt;&gt; I mean, what do these men have in common? They&#x27;re leftists.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re all leftists. &gt;&gt; And and and they&#x27;ve got good hair. Those those are the two through lines. Um uh you forgot. Also, Katie Kirrick had that job.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I I think I intentionally blocked that out. She Can I Can I tell you something? I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not like a fan of Katie Kirk&#x27;s anchoring, but she&#x27;s tougher than any of them. She&#x27;s tougher than any one of those guys. &gt;&gt; She is very tough.</p>
<p>I agree. I concur with that. &gt;&gt; That That&#x27;s the one they should have had cry in a segment to feminize. &gt;&gt; Women are expected to be soft. Um and and we don&#x27;t need another crying feminine worried about his waist news anchor in the evening news chair.</p>
<p>Okay, let&#x27;s keep going. Um things in Minnesota are not going particularly well. Tim Walls has announced he&#x27;s not going to run for reelection. And now we&#x27;re learning and DHS has swarmed 2,000 agents into Minneapolis to try to find out what&#x27;s happening at these daycare centers and elsewhere, whether and how bad the fraud is. Um, and then our pal Rich McHugh over at News Nation was just calling attention to this this morning.</p>
<p>There is, hold on, I want to try to find it. There&#x27;s a I&#x27;ve got the report here someplace. There is Here it is. try to follow this Department of Human Services in Minnesota and they&#x27;ve got a commissioner and they are investigating whether a group within the human services group called the Behavioral Health Administration committed any sort of fraud. And this is an organization, the one, the behavioral health that um helps manage hundreds of millions of dollars in grants um to groups that are supposed to be preventing and treating mental health and substance use disorders in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Okay. So, behavioral health overseas millions of hundreds of millions in grants to groups saying they&#x27;re going to help people with their mental health and substance abuse. and its boss, you know, the agency it&#x27;s part of, human services, has decided it needs an audit. And the person doing the auditing is now on camera accusing them. Like this is the own, you know, the sub subset of their agency of defrauding her as she conducted her investigation of her group of backdating documents, etc.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to play you the soundbite. Watch this. We noted that during the course of our audit, we identified a number of documents that the Behavioral Health Administration either backdated or created after our audit began in response to our request for information because we identified a number of different documents that again have been created in response to our request for documentation or that had actually been created and then backdated. We do have some questions about the validity of the documentation we were provided, but I do want to talk about what a serious issue this is and how it is frankly unacceptable for the agencies we audit to to do this type of activity. Okay, this is yet another problem for Minnesota and Tim Walls.</p>
<p>This is not the daycare. This is yet another problem. behavioral health and substance abuse centers where the own Minnesota auditor is saying, and this is in the writeup of it, you fabricated documentation to try to satisfy my audit. You backdated documents. You came up with false justifications for for spending that were And this is all taxpayer money, Mark.</p>
<p>So Tim Walsh is out there trying to blame his I&#x27;m not going to run for reelection literally on Donald Trump and his meanness. And I&#x27;ll play you the sound bit. He tried to pivot to January 6th as some sort of relevant thing when uh defending his decision. And it it appears that there is fraud rampant in virtually every organization under Tim Walls&#x27;s control. Mark, &gt;&gt; he better hope that the investigative reporting bandwidth of the state is filled up with other things because uh even though he he&#x27;s not running for election, he is staying in office.</p>
<p>And uh we&#x27;ve seen now uh what just human logic and human nature would tell you is the tip of the iceberg. And whether he&#x27;s implicated in things or simply was a bad steward of the taxpayer dollars, it&#x27;s not just state money, it&#x27;s federal money as well. Um, like I said, he&#x27;ll he&#x27;ll he&#x27;ll be fortunate if the parade moves on as opposed to digs in because there&#x27;s going to be a lot of fertile areas to look at the question of how could this stewardship have have occurred for a guy who put himself forward as one of the best governors in America. &gt;&gt; Here&#x27;s um just one example out in that same behavioral health unit. Auditors found an organization that received $672,000 for a single month of work for one month of work, but could not provide auditors with detailed invoices or program participation participant data to support the work.</p>
<p>The total grant agreement for that group was 1.6 million. So, it&#x27;s just that&#x27;s one little group that got money for this behavioral health nonsense that appears to have been made up. Lawmakers on both side of the aisle, quoting here from an article um from KSTP, appear deeply troubled by the revelation that department staff backdated or created documents that did not exist before the auditor&#x27;s probe. They quote a local Republican saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a shocking report by the legislative auditor, and it shows a culture of pervasive fraud, negligence, and deception.&quot; Here is how Tim Walsh would have you believe um things are going. He&#x27;s explaining why he&#x27;s not running for a third term, but he is absolutely not going to resign as governor.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll go 15 into 16. &gt;&gt; Your campaign by yourself or did you receive pressure from Democratic allies? &gt;&gt; Uh this is a decision that I make and make with my family. Um and certainly I think as I said it&#x27;s the right decision. We uh I&#x27;ll note I think it&#x27;s appropriate we&#x27;re here today. Uh the war that&#x27;s being waged against Minnesota, you&#x27;re seeing it.</p>
<p>We have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us that are for a show of the cameras. Um I&#x27;m going to note to all of you today is January 6th. There&#x27;s no debate what happened. The president of the United States led an insurrection against a fair election to try and overturn that. Here&#x27;s the thing that I&#x27;m going to ask all viewers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Republicans want to tear this state down. Republicans want to tell you it&#x27;s too dangerous to walk down the streets. Republicans want to tell you there&#x27;s nothing good comes out of Minneapolis St. Paul. Republicans want to tell you everybody with brown skin is stealing money or that they&#x27;re not welcome here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They want to do nothing to improve this state. Their idea of improving this state is being a parrot for Donald Trump agreeing to everything that he agreed with. Well, here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to tell you. It ain&#x27;t happening. I&#x27;m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>And you can make all your requests for me to resign over my dead body. Will that happen? I will fight this thing till the very end to make this state better. And the question that I think they need to decide is is when did the guy in the White House resign? When does he take accountability for what he did? Because it isn&#x27;t going to happen here. &gt;&gt; All right, Mark. This appears to me in political terms to be best defense is a good offense.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s What&#x27;s the reality? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know if you remember Nathan Thurm from Saturday Night Live when he uh you know, he would say you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s corrupt. Someone should be investigating you. I do wonder if he believes it, right? I wonder whether he believes what he&#x27;s saying or it&#x27;s purely just an act because he&#x27;s saying it with such emotion and com and passion and determination. Uh but to to to pivot from accountability for his stewardship of the state and the taxpayer dollars to blame it all on Donald Trump is quite something. But as I said, just as an observer of human beings and of the subspecies of human beings called politicians, I wonder whether he believes what he&#x27;s saying or not.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. This fraud didn&#x27;t happen just in December 2025. &gt;&gt; This has been going on for years under his leadership. And that Rich McHugh story about the um behavioral health unit within Department of Human Services in Minnesota. He pointed out there&#x27;s there are tweets from and I pulled them up April 2024 from Minnesota staff.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s the the account is from Minnesota staff at DHS and they say they&#x27;re asking can the commissioner explain why Department of Human Services has been obstructing data requests in violation of government laws? Why are staff complaining that leaders are forcing them to delete records, backdate contracts, and cover up wrongdoing? Why does the Department of Human Services ignore requests from the news? Okay, so this is &gt;&gt; April of 24. Yeah. you know, maybe he was too busy trying to buddy up to the Biden administration at the time or Joe Biden thinking possibly there&#x27;d be a role for him in the next administration. This would have been before Kla Harris &gt;&gt; took over as the nominee. But this is just it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a worms, what&#x27;s the word I&#x27;m looking for? It&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a hornets nest &gt;&gt; because it&#x27;s just the one right now.</p>
<p>Like you pull the one that the one bee flew out, now another bee is flowing out. Now it&#x27;s a whole swarm coming out on the Somali fraud and other fraud. And I think it&#x27;s gonna it&#x27;s gonna go state-tostate. Trump&#x27;s already now threatening California. He&#x27;s going to take a look over there.</p>
<p>And let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s going to be largely in blue states because it&#x27;s the same thing as Minnesota, I&#x27;d venture to say, where they&#x27;re worried about looking into anything that looks like harassment of a minority community. In this case, it has to do with immigration and immigrants who are taking advantage of us. not not skin color but immigrants who are taking advantage of hardworking Americans. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The governor now is trying to convince people as he declines changes course and does run for a term that he has a zeal for feriting out the wrongdoing and that&#x27;s belied by two things.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s belied by the fact that he was in charge when all this was happening and there&#x27;s you know there were indictments. There was clear indication he showed no zeal to ferret it this out for the reasons probably likely that you said. But the other thing is I just don&#x27;t find his performance compelling. If you&#x27;re spending more time talking about Donald Trump and being defiant about not resigning than you are laying out a detailed plan rather than just some rhetoric about getting to the bottom of it, it&#x27;s just hard to believe that there&#x27;s a determination here. And I think there must have been horrible poll numbers to get him to decide he wasn&#x27;t going to run for reelection because that&#x27;s what he was about.</p>
<p>Uh somebody must have done a poll and found that his chances of winning even in a blue state were pretty miserable. are now zip. Um, let&#x27;s talk about Venezuela for a minute. &gt;&gt; You say Marco Rubio&#x27;s stock is rising. &gt;&gt; He was in that Vanity Fair interview saying if JD Vance runs, he&#x27;s our nominee.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, is it settled or is it not? &gt;&gt; I think it&#x27;s settled. They&#x27;re genuine friends. Sometimes in politics, people say they&#x27;re friends and they&#x27;re not, but these guys are. And Rubio&#x27;s understands the the reality. He&#x27;s not going to he&#x27;s not going to leaprog over Vance if Vance decides to run.</p>
<p>But but the future will probably will take care of itself. But uh what I traced on next up and I think is just an incredible human story is 10 years ago this guy was calling Donald Trump Donald Trump was calling him little Marco and he was and he he was calling Trump a fraud and he was uh and he was making jokes about the size of Donald Trump&#x27;s hands and now he is he is so well thought of in general in the administration and like Henry Kissinger first person since Kissinger to have both the jobs national security adviser and secretary of state and on this Latin America stuff his influence is even greater because of his his familiarity with the region as the son of Cuban immigrants, as someone very familiar with Latin American dictators and the culture and the language and the and the the the rhythms of this whole thing. So, uh, he&#x27;s extremely powerful right now and extremely respected and his ties to Vance, Trump, Suzie Wild, Steven Miller, he&#x27;s just, uh, he&#x27;s just, uh, rare to see this and he doesn&#x27;t have very many enemies. Even on Capitol Hill where he served, where people are generally pissed off at the White House, he&#x27;s very wellresected, very well thought of. So, this is a moment for him that&#x27;s quite unusual in big- time Washington politics to be hugely influential and very secure in his position, very well-liked by his colleagues.</p>
<p>Um, it&#x27;s unusual and and he&#x27;s and he&#x27;s doing it uh at a time when the administration&#x27;s foreign policy is just in overdrive. I mean, you list 20 different hotspots around the world, including Venezuela, where there&#x27;s a lot at stake and where he&#x27;s got the the the hand on the tiller. He was confirmed unanimously by the Senate uh to this post, which is very unusual for the Trump appointees. &gt;&gt; Um since you&#x27;ve had a couple say like, &quot;I regret voting for you.&quot; And he said, &quot;Your your regret is a badge of honor.&quot; &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; but it is interesting to me when you think about 2028, Mark, because Okay. Well, while if Marco says if JD wants it, it&#x27;s JD&#x27;s.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s going to be a fight within the party because the more neoconi right prefers Marco Rubio who&#x27;s I wouldn&#x27;t call him a neocon but he&#x27;s certainly more neocon friendly &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; and JD Vance is not and I think you know the more isolationist what are you non-interventionalist right is definitely going to prefer JD and I&#x27;ve already seen some of my more neoconi friends online say hold on hold on hold slow your roll it&#x27;s not going to be a coronation of JD Vance. Like they&#x27;re much more interested in Marco Rubio, but if you&#x27;re Marco Rubio, even though your stock is rising and you know, everyone likes him. &gt;&gt; Um, how do you see it? Like he I think he&#x27;d probably do better with a general electorate than JD, but with the Republican base, who&#x27;s going to win? &gt;&gt; I think there&#x27;ll be a ticket. I I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t see any scenario where Rubio runs against Vance. Now, look, the economy is bad.</p>
<p>Everything&#x27;s kind of up in the air, but I think Vance will run and I think he could do an unprecedented thing and and pick Rubio as his running mate in 2027. Let them raise money together and raise $2 billion literally before the Democrats can pick their nominee, get Trump&#x27;s endorsement. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s definitely going to happen, but I could see it happening. Rubio&#x27;s got young kids. He&#x27;s a young guy.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t need to run in four years or eight years. He can wait. And if you talk to people in the party, again, things can change. But where we are now, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very difficult to imagine someone particularly a member of the president&#x27;s cabinet successfully mounting a challenge to JD Vance. And lastly, on the point you raised about ideology, Vance is talking lately like an interventionist, not an isolationist, not a MAGA first, America first.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s he&#x27;s singing from the himnil of saying here&#x27;s why we&#x27;re doing all this activist stuff. And Rubio is talking less like a neocon these days. Uh, so I think they can they can mesh that up pretty well because it&#x27;s the models Trump which is no foreign wars of of deep entanglement, no forever wars, no American boots on the ground, but using American military and technology to project strength around the world. I think they&#x27;re both on board for that. I would love to see that ticket, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;ll happen because if I think about why Trump picked JD, one of the arguments that was made to him was JD&#x27;s he&#x27;s an assassination insurance that no one&#x27;s going to want to take out Trump and wind up with JD Vance.</p>
<p>Like they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not going to think they&#x27;re going to do better with a JD than a Trump. And I don&#x27;t know whether that same rule would apply uh in the heads of those who think about these things if Marco were the VP. I think he would be the preferred choice of many. &gt;&gt; And um I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not sure.</p>
<p>I I love the guy, but I just I&#x27;m trying to think like if I were the person who gets to make these selections, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one of the things you got to think about. Anyway, we&#x27;ll find out soon enough. Mark, &gt;&gt; um we will. I I I really do think they&#x27;ll end up together. And uh you know it&#x27;s a lot like Clinton Gore.</p>
<p>A lot of people thought well Al Gore is more qualified than Bill Clinton. But the alchemy of the two of them together, two younger guys with young kids, it just worked for the voters both in the in in in the Democratic party and more broadly. I think this could be very comparable to that. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, great to see you, my friend.</p>
<p>Thank you. Happy New Year. Coming up next, &gt;&gt; you too. Happy New Year. A deep dive into the the issue of UFOs or UAPs.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to say that at all times um many of us feel at some point in our day sluggish, bloated, or not quite ourselves. Modern life is hard. Processed foods, too little sleep, endless stress, all of it can disrupt your gut, sap energy, and weaken immune health. Your body&#x27;s not failing.

<p>There is breaking news right now which I want to bring to you out of Minneapolis. As you know, uh, we reported to you yesterday and also this morning on AM update. Trump has surged 2,000 troops into Minneapolis, ICE agents, not troops, to go and, uh, and DHS personnel, investigate the fraud that has been coming to light day by day in that city. Uh well, we&#x27;ve just received this from um a deputy uh a deputy secretary at Homeland Security uh named Trish Trisha McGlaughlin, who we&#x27;ve mentioned before. She&#x27;s assistant secretary secretary of the DHS who says today ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.</p>
<p>An act of domestic terrorism. An ICE officer fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement, and the safety of the public fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers. The alleged perpetrator was hit and is deceased. The ICE officers who were hurt are expected to make full recoveries.</p>
<p>This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults in our law on our law enforcement. These men and women who are simply enforcing the law on the books are facing a,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats. This is an evolving situation and we will give the public more information as soon as it becomes available. Also, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Fry weighing in saying, &quot;I&#x27;m aware of a shooting involving an ICE agent at 34th in Portland. The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city.</p>
<p>Is it really the presence or is it your unmanaged city from fraudsters to illegals running loose in Minneapolis, sir? Uh he goes on to say, &quot;We&#x27;re demanding ICE to leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.&quot; Here is some video just in that was posted to X by a poster named Gunther Eagleman who goes by Gunther Eagleman. His his caption is chaos erupts in Minnesota. Tear gas and pepper spray unleashed on radical protesters at he claims this is the ICE shooting scene as they hurl snowballs, block cars, and riot against law enforcement. Let&#x27;s watch it for a minute.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, so we grabbed this from Freedom News TV for this video. It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; chaos. You can see the yellow pepper spray or tear gas. You &gt;&gt; kill someone else. They&#x27;re saying this appears to be AFTER SOMEONE ELSE.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Cutting to a different scene. People are blocking looks like the egress of a DHS vehicle. They&#x27;re standing across the road so he can&#x27;t go. And there&#x27;s an &gt;&gt; I guess a DHS officer who&#x27;s spraying them in the face with something that doesn&#x27;t look very effective because they&#x27;re not moving at all. &gt;&gt; It just it can&#x27;t be tear gas or pepper spray because truly it&#x27;s having no effect on them.</p>
<p>Now they&#x27;re grabbing them one by one to clear the path for the ICE vehicle to leave. They&#x27;re standing right in the middle right in front of it. Here&#x27;s a protester literally on the grill of the DHS white SUV. HEY, HEY, you get the &gt;&gt; This is very dangerous business. You just don&#x27;t do this.</p>
<p>The cops are trying to move him out of the way. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re spraying them to try to get them to move. People have umbrellas to guard their faces. &gt;&gt; DHS are trying to push them out of the way so that their vehicle can move. &gt;&gt; GET OUT THE WAY OF THE TRUCK.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They don&#x27;t have enough officers. People keep infiltrating the road. NAZIS. &gt;&gt; FINALLY, the SUV moves forward. &gt;&gt; Appears to be aftermath of the protesters.</p>
<p>All right, we can get out. Um, this is going to become a thing for sure. You you know Tim Walls is two minutes from taking to the airwaves to blame Donald Trump for the innocent loss of life. Well, you know what you shouldn&#x27;t do? You really shouldn&#x27;t get in the path of DHS and you definitely should not try to run them over with your car. I think most of us, if that in fact is what happened, would expect to be shot dead.</p>
<p>If you take your vehicle, which is a danger a dangerous instrument under the law, and you try to run someone over, which is a I mean a direct pro provocation, an attack on law enforcement, you should expect deadly force to be used against you. That&#x27;s what DHS is saying happened. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this is caught on tape because these people were taping it. There were independent news agencies there getting some of the chaos on camera. And we saw this happen to DHS in another city.</p>
<p>Was it Charlotte where the woman tried to run over the DSHS agent and they did un they unloaded a firearm against her or shot her and she got shot. She lived and she drove herself to the hospital. Do you guys remember this report we brought you a month or so ago? She lived but you you cannot try to attack DHS with your truck. And by the way, if if they had run over that guy right in front of their vehicle, um he wouldn&#x27;t have much of a leg to stand on either. Like it&#x27;s called assuming the risk.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t intentionally try to murder somebody with your truck, whether you&#x27;re a civilian or a DHS agent. I mean, I can say more for the DHS&#x27;s restraint than I can for the protester. if what Homeland Security is saying is true, that actually there was someone who used their vehicle to try to hurt or kill ICE agents. Um, this is so unfortunate. There are what, 34,000, I think that&#x27;s what we reported, 34,000 illegals there in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Um, and some huge portion of them has have been convicted of crimes or accused of crimes. and and Trump slowly but surely, city by city is trying to clean the situation up. And by the way, a large faction of them in Minneapolis is is also accused of committing fraud. Um whether they&#x27;re legal or not, I don&#x27;t know. It kind of doesn&#x27;t matter either way.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not American and they&#x27;re stealing from American citizens who work hard. Uh this is going to become a thing for sure. We&#x27;ll stay on it. Now, I want to turn to the schedule segment. Uh, it&#x27;s the age-old question that has fascinated humans for centuries and continues to.</p>
<p>Are we alone in the universe or even on our own planet? My next guest says, &quot;Not only are UFOs or now they&#x27;re called UAPs, unidentified anomalous phenomena, that&#x27;s hard to remember, but UAPs real. But the government has allegedly been aware of them for decades and running a disinformation campaign to make you feel like an idiot if you believe reports about them. David Grush is a former US Air Force intelligence officer and senior intelligence official. He was his AY&#x27;s co-lead in UAP investigation and quote transmedium object analysis and reporting was reporting to the Pentagon&#x27;s UAP task force as well. In 2023, Gush filed a whistleblower complaint asserting that the United States has been operating a quote multi-deade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.</p>
<p>Meaning we&#x27;re taking what we find vehicles and trying to figure out how they operated and that Congress has been kept in the dark about large portions of the program. He later testified under oath before the House Oversight Committee, drawing national attention when he made this claim here. Watch. &gt;&gt; If you believe we have crashed craft, uh stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; As I&#x27;ve stated publicly already in my NewsNation interview, uh biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics, &gt;&gt; non-human? And that was the assessment of people uh with direct knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program. &gt;&gt; So, he&#x27;s alleging that we have crafts and we have nonhuman biologics from those crafts and that the American people are being kept in the dark about it. And he is not alone. He is not alone. Now, Pentagon officials have publicly denied that there&#x27;s any verified evidence of non-human intelligence or secret programs of this kind.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve been denying it for 80 years. But now, a new documentary called The Age of Disclosure is taking center stage. It&#x27;s extraordinary, examining decades of this alleged secrecy, and they have everyone in this film. The film features interviews with 34 former and current government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who is also coming on in just a moment, who claim the US has long been concealing evidence of nonhuman intelligence and UAPs. Here&#x27;s a part of the trailer.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Humanity is not the only intelligence in the universe. &gt;&gt; Humanity is not the only intelligent species. &gt;&gt; We are absolutely not alone. Non-human intelligence exists. &gt;&gt; UAPs are real.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re not human. &gt;&gt; I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings. &gt;&gt; This is so secret. Very, very few people in our entire government have been allowed access to it. &gt;&gt; Even presidents have been operating on a need to- know basis.</p>
<p>But that begins to ramp out of control. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not acceptable to have secret parts of government that no one ever sees. &gt;&gt; You better be careful about a government that doesn&#x27;t trust its people. cuz there&#x27;s no telling what they&#x27;ll pull on you. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s extraordinary.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get into it. David joins me now. David, thank you so much for your service and for being here. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Melanie. Thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks, Megan. Thank you for having me on. &gt;&gt; No worries. Uh, this is like a crazy story and a stunning story and disturbing. And I have to tell you, I&#x27;ve always been sort of open-minded to this issue, but more skeptical.</p>
<p>And I my skepticism is gone having watched the age of disclosure. It&#x27;s incredibly well done. And they&#x27;ve got everybody. I mean all of the like astrophysicists and extremely well educated and accomplished scientists who have been investigating this from the start. Well, not the start because it was 80 years ago, but in in recent decades on camera, on the record, saying as much as they can.</p>
<p>And the director of the film has been making the rounds saying the only reason he was able to get so many people to participate is because they felt there was safety in numbers and that they couldn&#x27;t either fire everyone or worse because a lot of these guys, these are distinguished guys served in the Air Force like yourself or served in the Pentagon, served all over the armed forces. A lot of these guys are actually worried not just about their careers getting killed but about them themselves getting killed. I mean, set it up for us on the stakes of the number of people who went on camera and actually started saying as much as they could without violating classified uh restrictions. &gt;&gt; Certainly, that&#x27;s a real fear and we we can certainly get into that. Uh, agent disclosure was u, you know, a project I didn&#x27;t fully participate in.</p>
<p>However, do I do applaud the effort uh in these individuals for at least uh coming forward and speaking and like you, I was a very skeptical person. Um, I was certainly open to the topic. Um I was interested in space and science in a very precocious way as a child. I ended up studying physics and the Air Force gave me a full ride scholarship and I was um obvious obviously open to the topic, but I was in positions of high trust in the government uh at the the most extreme levels uh having walked the halls of the West Wing uh personally handled the presidential daily intelligence brief and had some of the same broad accesses uh that the president and his cabinet has had over the years even as a as a young man across multiple uh administrations. I figured um when I was eventually brought into this topic uh working for the UAP task force, oh I would know uh this exists.</p>
<p>Somebody would have slipped and said something to me. At the time I was briefed to over 90% of all black programs in the Department of Defense um and uh also the intelligence community. And I had an arrogant opinion of the of the topic. I was certainly open to the idea, but I figured I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence and and uh I would have been briefed into those kind of things because I had a a need to know at the time. So, I came into it very similar to you uh but open-minded.</p>
<p>And then what what specifically were you assigned to where you started to see actual evidence that we&#x27;ve been researching this for 80 years that we do have crafts recovered that we have not that we have quote biologics recovered which include some sort of other being. And what was your reaction when you started to learn this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was very skeptical. I was in my my military capacity. had a parallel civilian uh intelligence career as well. Uh but in my my military reserve capacity, I was the backup intelligence director uh for the National Reconnaissance Offic&#x27;s uh operations center.</p>
<p>I briefed uh the NRO director. That&#x27;s where I handled the PDB and I handled essentially all sensitive activities daily brief &gt;&gt; and and all that stuff. And so uh the UAP task force was looking for a representative from that organization. And I came in uh as a skeptical eye, haven&#x27;t briefed to a lot of um US programs and I was thinking, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll figure out what this is. This might be some kind of US program, some prosaic natural phenomenon, some kind of adversarial program, some strategic technical surprise.&quot; Um but eventually uh as I started pulsing my networks uh digging into archives where we&#x27;ll just say certain programs forgot to fully clean out safe drawers and uh finding both audiovisisual uh documentation and then interviewing over 40 people all the way up to uh I&#x27;ll just say the cabinet level over the course of four years.</p>
<p>Uh so a combination of oral testimony, audiovisisual evidence and documentation. Uh I became convinced uh at a high confidence level uh that the US has engaged in a crash retrieval and reverse engineering operation of like the trailer you just played said uh non-human crafts and uh recovering you know the biologics as well. And and I say high confidence as somebody who&#x27;s written assessments for the president of the United States. I take that uh assessment very seriously and that confidence level very seriously. But as somebody who was in very high positions of trust over the years, uh I can assure you that that is an accurate statement that the US government, its private partners, allies, and adversaries do have programs.</p>
<p>Uh we&#x27;re doing this exact thing. &gt;&gt; Um many of in our audience may know you, David, you&#x27;ve been kind of really celebrated for people for coming out as a whistleblower and calling attention to the fact that our government&#x27;s been hiding this from us. And even when told to disclose what they know to investigators and to the public or to the overseers, they haven&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a deeper program called the legacy program. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That has really seems to have been trying to hide the most shocking pieces of what we know from even the UAP task force. Um we&#x27;ve had Lou Alzando on this show and he talked to us about some of what we&#x27;d learned. This is years ago. I mean, it was when we first launched the program in 2020, but here he is as part of the documentary uh Age of Disclosure speaking to what this legacy program has uncovered. I&#x27;m just going to run the ST 54 here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We discovered another deeply hidden and much larger UAP program. This program was so sensitive that it was withheld from the Secretary of Defense, Congress, and even the President of the United States. This program is referred to as the legacy program. This program had been capturing, retrieving, and reverse engineering UAPs since at least 1947. On numerous occasions, these retrievalss included the bodies of nonhumans, some sort of intelligence, intelligent being that is not human.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; On numerous occasions, I mean, that is just stunning, David. To to like people who don&#x27;t follow this, he&#x27;s saying they found some sort of alien beings bodies along with the crafts that the government has had it for decades. it&#x27;s happened multiple times and that they&#x27;re all the whole theory of the the entire movie with all of these storied experts. These are not crackpots. I mean, if they&#x27;re crackpots, boy, they found dozens of them who have been at the highest levels of our government um over generations who are all saying yes, this has happened.</p>
<p>And the reason that that they keep it secret from everyone including they point out in the in the piece our own presidents over the over time is what? &gt;&gt; Well, it depends on the time epoch in which administration. Uh certainly there were former secretaries of defense uh and presidents that were briefed on this matter. um it depended on their level of trust that the you know the deep state if you will the lifers and the governments uh had with those said individuals and unfortunately this uh subject has been a victim of a lot of I&#x27;ll call it uh domestic information operations something I discussed initially publicly in 2023 and there&#x27;s certainly been this game of thrones activity with multiple factions of the deep state uh in a bipartisan manner uh the Republicans and the Democrats are both guilty. Um, and even in a recent previous administration, in the Obama administration, there was certainly um actions taken uh strategically uh to help a particular uh presidential candidate uh possibly if if this um subject were to become normalized and they got elected president. So, there&#x27;s been a lot of gamesmanship and a lot of uh I&#x27;ll call it house of cards type type activities in the past.</p>
<p>But it is true that a lot of people have been uh withheld. I found it deeply disgusting and shocking that even I was not fully accessed into these activities and I did have a congressionallymandated need to know. I investigated this on behalf of the first Trump administration and some of Trump&#x27;s cabinet members and and Senator Rubio when he was Senator, you know, a senator now Secretary Rubio and um providing my findings up the chain. Uh I was just very disturbed uh to find uh how this was controlled. The self-linking ice cream cone unaccountable.</p>
<p>Everybody owns a piece. Nobody owns the outcome and there&#x27;s not really a mob boss. The closest person we got that uh I was aware of was unfortunately now deceased uh Vice President Dick Cheney. Uh Darth Vader himself. Not shocking that he was involved in this.</p>
<p>And essentially when he left in 2009, that was the last time that these activities really had central leadership. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because the film posits that you know the the current and the last head of CIA probably don&#x27;t know but there&#x27;s like lower branches within the CIA that have specific responsibilities and the career employees there probably do and they don&#x27;t look at the political appointees brought in by a president as someone to whom they need to disclose anything they&#x27;re like this guy&#x27;s going to be gone in you know a year two years four at the most I&#x27;m not going to keep disclos closing this to person after person. I&#x27;m keeping this very dark as my predecessor did. And they all it also posits that when it&#x27;s super secret, they&#x27;ve been offloading the research to private contractors and that way they don&#x27;t have to include any of these disclosures in response to foyer requests made of the federal government because it&#x27;s been given to a private entity.</p>
<p>But that too leads to no accountability and no no person over the life of you know 20 years who&#x27;s got real responsibility because companies get sold, new people come in and then these companies may just exploit the materials for the latest technological advantage. you know, who knows like I don&#x27;t know some AI development or some fast speed train development that a company may have used the information to build a commercial advantage with. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s totally true. You you actually accurately described how it is. uh early on uh the global war on terror um a lot of the money that was initially given to these companies was essentially reallocated uh for overseas contingency operations and these contractors essentially uh started to do their own thing if you will something called IRAD internal research and development and uh privately they continued certain things that actually the government was trying to cancel as it relates to the subject and they went off um and retrieved and exploited things essentially on their own uh and only loosely accountable back uh to their government handlers.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s funny you mentioned the CIA. Um naturally there&#x27;s a lot of uh good men and women that work there. Uh my wife actually was a CIA officer and she also served in the Air Force with me. Um but uh Chairwoman Luna and the task force and the committee staff uh certainly I assisted in my other uh professional capacity um helping Representative Burlson&#x27;s office did send legal interrogatives uh to several agencies and private companies. CIA was one of them.</p>
<p>Um and curiously enough uh CIA provided what I considered extremely disrespectful response. They declined to answer our interrogatives on this matter, which is their participation in crash retrieval operations and just referred us to the Pentagon&#x27;s AROW office, which has a nebulous in concerning history in itself. And I just find it very interesting that CIA uh did that. Now, I&#x27;m not saying John Rackcliffe or Michael Ellis, who&#x27;s the acting general counsel and deputy director, had a hand in that response. Uh but they certainly are the leaders of their organization.</p>
<p>John Rackcliffe has spoke positively on this issue previously and I I would hope that John Rackcliffe was placed there uh by DNI Gabbard and the president to enact some reforms on the CIA and unfortunately the CIA has a lot of skeletons in its closets. Um other things I know about that I can&#x27;t talk about that are conventional national security issues. Uh but the crash retrieval issue unfortunately is is certainly one of them and they&#x27;ve um done a lot of concerning things. What&#x27;s being alleged by you and many others is that is that they have &gt;&gt; literal skeletons in their closet or whatever &gt;&gt; they do &gt;&gt; whatever&#x27;s inside an alien being. Uh because here&#x27;s it&#x27;s it sounds crazy to just throw it out there short form.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, but it person after person, distinguished scientist after uh intel person is making the same claim, validating the stories about Roswell telling other stories that have happened at um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s many military facilities with what appears to be a clear alien craft coming overhead, looking almost diamondlike in shape, being huge, sitting there, hovering, coming from something like 80,000 ft and dropping down then hovering in in a way that no vehicle that we know of, right now could possibly do. Nothing invented by man. Um, here is a montage from the movie of top US officials talking about how all of this is relevant because it may pose a serious national security threat. It&#x27;s stop 42. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s not ours and we don&#x27;t know whose it is.</p>
<p>That alone, just that statement alone deserves inquiry, deserves attention, deserves focus. &gt;&gt; If you have objects in the sky that you cannot identify, that&#x27;s a problem because it could be China, it could be Russia, it could be any adversary. &gt;&gt; Well, any unexplained phenomenon could pose a national security threat. &gt;&gt; Clapper, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s the way you have to treat those things. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something violating our airspace.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s something fouling our ranges that even the people we&#x27;ve tked in the executive branch to understand this cannot provide an explanation. So I would say in addition to the national security implications, this has implications for basic trust and confidence in the American government. &gt;&gt; I I just want to play one more. Um, here we have a former Navy pilot describing the UAP&#x27;s defying extreme weather and physics in SOP 45. &gt;&gt; In 2014 to 2015, we were operating off the coast of Virginia Beach off the eastern seabboard.</p>
<p>It was during this time that we upgraded our radar from the APG73 to the APG79 radar. And this allowed us to essentially see more objects we weren&#x27;t expecting to see. And there&#x27;s a particular case of one of these objects maintaining a complete stationary position inside of 120 kn winds. Essentially inside of a hurricane &gt;&gt; going against the wind. The wind&#x27;s 120 knots west.</p>
<p>So look at this thing. It&#x27;s rotating. &gt;&gt; It just seems like they&#x27;re not affected by the environment the way we are. &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s testimonial after testimonial like that. David, that that&#x27;s not unique to have an experienced fighter pilot like our our men and women in the military have been quietly coming forward and reporting on this for a long time only to be told, &quot;Keep your mouth shut.&quot; No, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>And I I have Air Force pilot friends of mine that have seen um astounding things while on duty to include uh glowing triangular craft uh you know, hovering above other aircraft cruising at you know 50,000 ft. And I did want to point out uh General Clapper, the former DNI in the documentary. Um I certainly applaud him for at least speaking out in general. Um he goes on, I believe, I&#x27;ve only seen clips of agent disclosure, not the whole thing. Um where there was a program when he was the director of national intelligence, uh where they were tracking these vehicles over Area 51, of course, the famed, uh classified test location.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed as a fellow Air Force officer and certainly General Clapper ra rose to the ranks as three star general. Uh that&#x27;s all he said in the documentary that that was uh a program he was aware of. Uh in fact uh without being inappropriate, I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue, managed the crash retrieval issue, and when he was the DNI, USDI and DIA director, he placed people in critical roles uh to manage this issue. uh both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say not uh non-publicly as well and I&#x27;ll allow the audience uh distill what I&#x27;m saying uh at the at the risk of being inappropriate or going too far with my uh discussion. So uh General Clapper, Stephanie Sullivan, other folks in the IC that are well aware of this issue that were in rooms discussing this issue.</p>
<p>Um I ask you to be u greater leaders on this. I should not be the only former uh military officer and intelligence official uh that is uh being completely candid with the information that they were exposed to. So um perhaps &gt;&gt; once again James Clapper understates what he knows and what he&#x27;s done notingly. Um &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; I want to talk about Marco Rubio because it really is extraordinary to see him on camera participating so so willingly in this so fully. And here is how he phrased the dangers and and the risks of this whole thing, especially like the secrecy around it in S 43.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Some of the biggest strategic blunders in human history. The foundation of those blunders were a lack of imagination. The belief that an adversary or whoever could not do something because it had never been done before. The US thought it was safe with those ships in Pearl Harbor because we didn&#x27;t think that the Japanese could get there, much less have torpedoes that could navigate such a narrow straight and and hit these ships until they did. We never thought in our wildest dreams that terrorists would strike us in the homeland by training for a year to become pilots and then hijacking commercial aircraft and crashing them into buildings.</p>
<p>And they did. The thing that always keeps me up at night, something in the human psyche that says I don&#x27;t have time or energy to sort of prepare for the unforeseen or what I&#x27;ve never seen done before. And um you know that that leads to strategic surprise and and and some sometimes strategic surprises that change the course of human history. &gt;&gt; What do you think, David, that he should do? You know, if Marco Rubio called you tomorrow and said, &quot;What should we do about this?&quot; What would you say? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he certainly gave uh a deflated response on Hannity recently saying he has no ability to investigate certainly as a national security adviser uh secretary of state and the chief archavist of the United States which that last position is actually uh very important because under National Archives they manage the public interest the classification board and between that and the presidential intelligence advisory board currently chaired by Mr. Devon Nunez um and his uh connection to the cabinet officials.</p>
<p>Um certainly uh Secretary Rubio or National Security Advisor Rubio um should uh authorize a legal and lawful investigation using resources in the Department of Justice in the Internal Revenue Service because there&#x27;s been a lot of procurement fraud, a lot of um misappropriation of funds, also white collar and blue collar crime uh to include uh harming &gt;&gt; um officials. So uh certainly &gt;&gt; but where would he start? Who would he whose tires would he kick first? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a a question uh or she&#x27;s an answer I would I would provide in person in a prescriptive manner behind the scenes. Uh certainly uh there are elements within uh the central intelligency agency director of science and technology. I would start there. There are certain career officials uh that are still there that manage the issue.</p>
<p>uh there are certain officials uh that are long- timerrs in the office of the director of national intelligence um that have been there for a very very long time uh that also helped manage this issue for a while. So I certainly have the rolodex of names offices um and I&#x27;ve I certainly have bumped into the halls and walls facilities where everything is. So I think it&#x27;s um Secretary Rubio liazing with the vice president and uh President Trump uh getting the boss&#x27;s strategic vision on this how they would like to proceed publicly but privately uh and start going after some of those agencies and and the Department of the Air Force particular offices and organizations within there that are where very uh near and dear to my heart uh were also involved. So I have to be a little evasive and vague publicly. I don&#x27;t like to tip off.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re already doing so much to to tell us what we need to know. I I appreciate it. I know there are certain lines you can&#x27;t cross or you get in trouble. Um, &gt;&gt; just to sort of broad brush it now for people who haven&#x27;t seen the movie, who haven&#x27;t been following you and your whistleblower complaint and your testimony before Congress, for the person sitting at home right now, David Dave, saying this is You like he hasn&#x27;t seen an alien craft. So, how does he know? Like what what&#x27;s the best evidence? Like what can you what can we say? is now having watched it like I am totally on board.</p>
<p>I am very persuaded. But what what do you think is the best evidence for the people sitting at home to understand this is real and it has been kept secret by the government and it and the reason they&#x27;re so skeptical about it is in large part due to an active disinformation campaign that&#x27;s been unleashed against them and our society for decades now to try to make it seem crazy to talk about this. Yeah, certainly that was a private uh finding of the Robertson panel in 1953 and that&#x27;s kind of when the the infin campaign ensued. Uh the best piece of evidence that I that is very obscure that is declassified. Uh there was a former classified Australian government analysis that is currently in the Australian National Archives.</p>
<p>It was declassified several years ago. Uh but really the public doesn&#x27;t really know about it. Uh this was a 1971 analysis by uh senior physicist Harry Turner who was in charge of nuclear uh procurement for the Australian governments uh in the 60s and 70s. He was a top secret cleared senior physicist for the government and through his sourcing and this is a formally classified assessment of an allied government. Um, uh, Harry Turner discusses, uh, in the first couple pages of that assessment, if if people download it and go to page seven or eight through 20, they&#x27;ll see what I&#x27;m talking about, where Turner talks about how the CIA and and other organizations secretly knew this was a real issue, started that disinformation campaign, started secretly working on reversing aspects of the technology.</p>
<p>Um, but the US government was deadly serious on the topic at the time and it&#x27;s quite the eyebrow raiser. Um, if you actually read that document that was originally classified and is an official Australian uh, government document that um, the public is not really aware of just because it&#x27;s obscure if you will. And then of course the only other thing to mention is there is certainly a myriad of declassified um government documents, US government documents discussing the same craft morphologies. The tic tac of today was the propane tank in 1953 when Air Force OSI was investigating things um for their for the &gt;&gt; tic tac reference is is what many many pilots have said they&#x27;ve seen flying in the sky. Once we got better radar, they started to see what looks like the shape of a tic tac in the sky, but it has propulsion uh abilities and hovering abilities that no craft made by man has.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s been confusing decorated, respected pilots for some time now since we improved that radar. And it does no one any good just to call them all a bunch of cooks. They&#x27;re all a bunch of nuts. Um, if if so, we&#x27;ve got a lot of very nutty, respected pilots who we&#x27;ve put in the most dangerous positions possible in addition to those in the intel communities and like you who have responsibility for investigating things like this. You&#x27;ve shown a lot of courage, David.</p>
<p>Thank you for telling your story. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Megan, for having me on. &gt;&gt; All right, coming up, as I mentioned, Representative Anna Paulina Luna uh of Florida has been very outspoken about this issue. She&#x27;s in the documentary as well and she is here next. You know how much my family and I love our dogs, right? Even sweet Strudwick.</p>
<p>My goodness, he was naughty over the holiday season. You will read about it in our newsletter. But Ba man oh man, Strudwick, he&#x27;s as cute as ever and sadly as naughty depending on the circumstances. Um, nonetheless, I love him and I can&#x27;t imagine life without either one of my dogos. They&#x27;ve got a great life, but some dogs are not so lucky.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so glad to tell you about Delta Rescue. It&#x27;s the largest nokill care for life animal sanctuary in the world. They have rescued thousands of dogs, plus cats and horses, too. They provide all the animals with shelter, safety, and most of all, love.

<p>Visit deltarrescue.org today to learn more. That&#x27;s deltarrescue.org. I just want to update you be before we bring in the congresswoman on this shooting that&#x27;s happened in Minneapolis of a civilian by a I think an ICE agent, certainly a DHS agent. Um the video has just come in via social media and I&#x27;ll try to describe what it is we&#x27;re seeing. Um let&#x27;s play it.</p>
<p>Okay, you have a parked maroon SUV. ICE pulls up in a gray truck. An officer comes out. He&#x27;s walking over to the parked SUV. Another officer comes from another car and is at the front.</p>
<p>The woman backs up. &gt;&gt; Shame. OH MY GOD. WHAT THE &gt;&gt; And they appear to shoot her &gt;&gt; as she drives away. &gt;&gt; What the did you do? &gt;&gt; And she&#x27;s dead.</p>
<p>Can we Let&#x27;s rerack it. &gt;&gt; You are criminals. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re criminals. Let&#x27;s rerack it. Okay, so she&#x27;s parked.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s not going anywhere. So, we got the brake lights on. She&#x27;s not moving. The ICE agent gets out of a gray &gt;&gt; truck, pickup truck. He walks over to the front driver&#x27;s side along with another agent.</p>
<p>Now, she backs up. She&#x27;s trying to go away. That&#x27;s clear. She&#x27;s trying to run away. &gt;&gt; And it appears one of them shoots her.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WHAT THE &gt;&gt; The video doesn&#x27;t make There&#x27;s two officers on the left. There&#x27;s one on the right. And one of them fires into the car. I don&#x27;t know which one. Um, there she was.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was the one on the front right, Deb, cuz there&#x27;s two on the driver&#x27;s side and there&#x27;s one on the passenger side. &gt;&gt; What the &gt;&gt; Okay, so it&#x27;s the one in the very front who was potentially in danger by her driving, but that will be a point of contention. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not going to be a one day story. I can tell you that. This is going to keep going.</p>
<p>Um, she clearly was trying to drive away against the commands of the officers, but uh there&#x27;ll be a big dispute about whether the unloading of the gun was appropriate in these circumstances. You heard DHS claiming the officer was in fear for his life and that of others. They were right next to her SUV as she tried to pull away. Um, but whether their fear of deadly force from her, you driving out of their range was justified will be an issue that we&#x27;re going to be debating. Uh, and you&#x27;re already getting plenty of condemnation from uh people, as I said, like like Mayor Fry and others quick to weigh in against ICE.</p>
<p>We will we&#x27;ll wait until we see more and no more. In the meantime, I want to bring in Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna of Florida. She&#x27;s the chairwoman of the task force on the declassification of federal secrets. Think of that. There&#x27;s a task force on the declassification of federal secrets.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a great group to be the chairwoman of. She&#x27;s been holding hearings pushing the federal government for transparency on UAPs and other classified programs. Here&#x27;s just one moment from one of those hearings. Watch this. &gt;&gt; The public should be seeing this stuff.</p>
<p>And and why you&#x27;re not allowed to, I don&#x27;t know. But that&#x27;s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounced right off. Um, and they kept going. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d like to ask the committee to replay that video that Berles had played earlier. &gt;&gt; Showing the video.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Are you aware of anything in the government uh, United States government arsenal that can split a hellfire missile like this? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And do whatever blob thing it did and then keep going. Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>Okay. Um, does this video scare you guys? Yes or no? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Wiggins. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Nat. Uh, &gt;&gt; I had a different reaction. I I I was really happy that it got out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Representative Luna is also fighting for stronger protections for whistleblowers like David Grush, our first guest. Uh, she&#x27;s a veteran of the US Air Force and she has said that she personally had an encounter herself with an object she believes was likely a UAP. She joins me now for the first time. Representative, great to have you. &gt;&gt; Nice to have you, Megan.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thanks for being here. So, okay, this is I&#x27;m going to be honest. You know, when you hear this out of the blue without having sat through the hearing or watched the latest documentary, you think, is everybody nuts? Like, are they all in on it? Is it like But I&#x27;ve heard you talk about this so many times, matter of factly, on Joe Rogan and in the halls of Congress. I believe you and I believe you believe it. And having watched this documentary now, I believe it, too.</p>
<p>Boy, if it&#x27;s a lie, they got a lot of storied scientists to spew a bunch of nonsense at risk to their own careers and reputations about it. You&#x27;ve run the hearings. You&#x27;ve talked to countless guys who have been investigating this for years. What&#x27;s your conclusion? &gt;&gt; Um, look, we, especially from a national security perspective, want to know why it is that if these things or if whatever this is is real. Um why is it first of all that members of Congress who serve as the oversight authority for the civilian arm um really the American people are being denied access to the videos and photos of what we displayed in that hearing.</p>
<p>Megan um Representative Berles had that video dead dropped to him. It was scrubbed with any um I guess data that could point to who gave the information to him. But that is a confirmed real video and as you are seeing that is a type of footage that unless it is basically leaked to us we&#x27;re being denied access to um specifically out of the Department of War. Now, this goes way back to last Congress, actually, when myself, Representative Gates, and Representative Burchett had actually done a field hearing following up on two whistleblowers or a few whistleblowers that had come forward to Representative Gates&#x27;s office that were pilots at Eglund Air Force Base, alleging that the US government was covering this up. Of course, when you hear something like that, you&#x27;re like, &quot;All right, you know, you&#x27;ve seen this in sci-fi films or heard rumors about this, but never have dealt with it directly.&quot; And then um basically in a nutshell, Representative Gates, Burchett and I went out to Eglund and of course they tried to cancel the meeting.</p>
<p>We got the meeting back on and then once we were there, we were actually denied access. We got into a massive fight with the base commander. We went in and out of this gift. And then ultimately um without saying too much, part of how we got some of the information that we did is I actually had asked one of the witnesses to draw for me um the photo photograph or the image of this thing that was essentially being denied um to us. So, they&#x27;re denying us the actual imagery, but the um the military officer was able to actually draw it for me, of which I&#x27;m sure um they think that we&#x27;re going to ask them to do that, but we did.</p>
<p>And again, um even dating back to my own military experience, there was one point when I was stationed at Portland Air National Guard u prior to leaving active duty. And at that point in time, there was an airspace incursion that had taken place that some of the pilots had been talking about. Um one specifically, I said, you know, what is this thing specifically? are you able to describe it? He couldn&#x27;t. He got kind of spooked talking about it. And that&#x27;s the um in my opinion, he definitely ran into a UAP or saw a UAP or they&#x27;re chasing one.</p>
<p>Uh but that is not the first time that we&#x27;ve had pilots in fear of losing their flight status for coming forward with this information. So I kind of started as a skeptic. Uh but after leading into the investigations, after seeing some of the footage like you saw in that hearing, um after talking to a number of people, not you know people that are driving Winnebago wearing tin foil, but legitimate credible people, it definitely seems real. &gt;&gt; Uh I mean I see Air Force pilots you talking about over and over encountering these things that come out of nowhere that can do things no aircraft could. I believe them.</p>
<p>They have absolutely no reason to lie about it and they have every reason to to not lie to not say that they saw that when they did. So you can see their reluctance in even talking about it. They don&#x27;t want to be seen as a kook, but they saw what they saw. In the in the documentary, The Age of Disclosure, they do have um former uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s called ATIP, and it&#x27;s a group that&#x27;s been investigating um all of this for some time, officials talking about a breakthrough theory and how they think these UAPs operate. and it would explain some of the experiences people have had with them.</p>
<p>Take a listen here to stop 46. &gt;&gt; This one breakthrough can be the key to interstellar travel where you want to travel long distances without taking enormous amounts of subjective time. We&#x27;d also have low observability because the bubble acts as a barrier between two space-time environments. This would eliminate or conceal most of the known signatures of conventional technologies. This is why radar would have difficulty tracking a craft because the signal from the radar would be distorted by the energy field around the craft.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The radar signatures literally just move around the bubble and doesn&#x27;t reflect back to the radar emitter. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s not surprising when someone takes a photo of a UAP, they find they get a fuzzy and distorted picture because they&#x27;re actually taking a photo through a space-time barrier. Do you know any of these guys representative? Because these quantum physicists that were all throughout this movie were very impressive and they&#x27;ve been seriously and soberly trying to study this for some time. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I believe I actually had gone into the skip with one of them. And there are a number of other people who I think would back up these theories on it.</p>
<p>Not to mention um when you&#x27;re talking about a barrier or maybe something surrounding these things, there have been instances and reports from firsthand witnesses that um these things do have a bubble if you will call it that. But what&#x27;s even kind of crazier to see, Megan, is that you know if this wasn&#x27;t real then why would the US government or elements within the US government be working so hard to make it difficult for us to say okay is this real? Is this not real? Can we see the evidence? The fact is is that the push back that we&#x27;ve received has been so um incredibly obvious at this point that it just kind of furthers our own opinions on there are people that are controlling this information and there does seem to be even outside of the purview of I think sometimes our own secretaries who have the best intentions on declassifying this stuff. There is this internal intelligence battle on this topic. And so you know you&#x27;re talking earlier about whistleblower protections. One of the things that we&#x27;re going to have to do because what I did not want to do is host just another hearing with more witness testimony without providing the documents and evidence.</p>
<p>I think that that would probably be a waste of resources unless we can provide that directly to the American people. And we have received the list. I think it&#x27;s over about 40 different documents um to actually be able to get that information to provide it, but also to to bring forward legislation out of oversight and actually just left a hearing earlier talking to the chairman about it to actually bring forward immunity for all of the people um some of them in the in the film, some personally that we know of to come talk with us um in a skiff about locations or specifically more information pertaining to this without you know being in fear of basically being hit with espionage. Yes, because I mean you heard David Gres was naming specific positions that need to be subpoenaed and looked into the guys the long-term guys who may actually have &gt;&gt; responsibility for this program. But up next, I&#x27;m hold you over if you if you can.</p>
<p>Um because up next we have to talk about why. What are they worried about in in disclosing any of this? There are some interesting answers there. Uh we&#x27;ll pick it up there when we come back. Don&#x27;t go away. Every new year, people think about what a real fresh start looks like.</p>

<p>Age of Disclosure. It&#x27;s on Amazon Prime right now. And I would love to hear your feedback on your own takeaways. Um, of course, it&#x27;s getting ripped by, you know, the Hollywood Reporter, the New York Times saying only a chump would believe what&#x27;s in there. I I don&#x27;t see how you watch this thing and don&#x27;t walk away believing, honestly.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve been a skeptic. Um, these people in in this video seem entirely credible and there&#x27;s 34 of them and they all have been at the head of these investigative committees for years. And like I said, respected physicists and fighter pilots. If these aren&#x27;t UAPs, what are they that they keep finding? And these guys are saying not just that they, you know, had midair encounters, but some of these people who do the investigations are saying we actually have craft and some sort of bodies or biological material. I want to get back to this shooting that just happened in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Christine Gnome, um, I think she was on Fox News. She called in and said the following quote. A woman attacked them. The the ICE agents who shot I think one shot. Oh, we have it.</p>
<p>We have a cut. Let&#x27;s watch. Let&#x27;s listen. &gt;&gt; You asked about a shooting that we just had in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Um it was an act of domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>Uh what happened was our ICE officers were out in an enforcement action. Uh they got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis. They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them and those surrounding them and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle. Uh, an officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot uh to protect himself and the people around him. And my understanding is is that she was hit and is deceased.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, let&#x27;s just see the video one more time. I don&#x27;t know what preceded this. We should say this for the record. Maybe there was a more dangerous confrontation before the tape that is circulating online that&#x27;s not on tape. The tape that is making the rounds, I will say doesn&#x27;t perfectly match up with that description.</p>
<p>However, I cannot say that the ICE agent on the front driver&#x27;s side of the vehicle did not feel in any way endangered by the fact that he was right there by the driver&#x27;s side window and she started to drive away. Now, you&#x27;re not allowed to shoot somebody just for fleeing. We don&#x27;t give the death penalty for fleeing an officer. However, if he genuinely felt that he was about to get run over, that would be a different story. What we seem to see in this film is that he just I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll say it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll describe it for listening audience again before we play it, but she&#x27;s parked in a maroon SUV. She&#x27;s not moving. this gray pickup truck with ICE agents pulls up or DHS employees pulls up. You see a guy in gray fatigues get out and go over to the driver&#x27;s side window. There&#x27;s another guy dressed in black who goes in front of him and then the story quickly becomes about a guy who appears to have come from, I&#x27;m guessing, the other side of the maroon car, like the passenger side.</p>
<p>He came up in his own ICE vehicle, I guess, from the passenger side. and he kind of folds in in front of the guy dressed in black who&#x27;s in front of the driver&#x27;s side window. Cuz this guy, you don&#x27;t even see just watching this tape from the left. You see the guy in the gray, you see the guy in the black right in front of him over to the driver&#x27;s side window. But it appears the guy who did the shooting came from the front of her car or the passenger side of her car from his own vehicle and he appears to be the one who did the shooting.</p>
<p>and she I don&#x27;t know what she was thinking, but she has these ICE agents on the side of her car and she decides to try to drive away. I mean, it seems to be a clear attempt to flee. Everybody knows when you&#x27;re talking to law enforcement, you don&#x27;t freaking drive away. Do not flee. But but again, in general, the rule is you cannot shoot somebody for fleeing unless you consider them armed and dangerous.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s generally the rule with cops. Now, they&#x27;re claiming that she tried to run them over. Is that what was in this guy&#x27;s head when he tried to shoot? And can we say watching this video definitively that that&#x27;s not true? No. Uh, but that&#x27;s certainly going to be in question because it&#x27;s not quite clear from the vantage point that we&#x27;re seeing so far. And I&#x27;m sure there will be other videos that will provide more information.</p>
<p>But let&#x27;s just watch it one more time. Stopped maroon vehicle. Here comes the the silver ice truck, pickup truck. The guy in the gray fatingsues kind of saunters over. A guy dressed in black comes in front of the guy in gray.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; She backs up. &gt;&gt; Oh my GOD. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; So she pulled just for listening audience. She kind of backed up.</p>
<p> did you do? &gt;&gt; You had three ICE agents on the left the passenger side of her car. Okay, we can stop it. three ICE agents on the passenger, sorry, the driver&#x27;s side of her car. And she reversed, which is relevant. She reversed, which is not good.</p>
<p>That definitely could telegraph to a cop that you&#x27;re trying to run him over. We&#x27;re watching it again. Then she goes forward. Then they shoot. Here&#x27;s we&#x27;re watching again.</p>
<p>The guy in the gray, he approaches. The guy in black approaches. And from somewhere, there&#x27;s a third guy who appears on the front left. She she reverses and then she backs up. Sorry, she backs up and then she goes forward.</p>
<p>Um, here is Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Fry. Do we Yeah, we have the SAT. Let&#x27;s listen to him. Better. But I do have a message for our community, for our city, and I have a message for ICE.</p>
<p>To ICE, get the out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart.</p>
<p>Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized. And now somebody is dead. That&#x27;s on you. And it&#x27;s also on you to leave. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe if you would cooperate with the federal authorities, sir, in rounding up the illegals who have no right to be there, then ICE would leave.</p>
<p>Why is ICE there? Why are they even there? They&#x27;re they&#x27;re not in Houston. That&#x27;s not their first choice. They&#x27;re there because you won&#x27;t enforce the nation&#x27;s laws. They&#x27;re trying to enforce the immigration laws. You have an obligation to cooperate with them.</p>
<p>If somebody gets arrested by working with ICE on the detainer, you won&#x27;t because you&#x27;re a sanctuary city, thus endangering everyone around. You amped up the pressure and the environment around these officers who are just trying to do their job. They&#x27;ve been getting shot at in city after city. And let&#x27;s not forget in Charlotte, I believe it was Charlotte, almost run over by a woman driving a truck. They had to shoot at her, too.</p>
<p>That woman lived, but you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in these the heads of these law enforcement officers. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re on a a razor&#x27;s edge right now because they&#x27;re under threat. There&#x27;s been bounties taken out on their heads. They&#x27;re trying to enforce the law, unlike you, Mayor Fry. This woman should not have backed up and then it&#x27;s almost like she didn&#x27;t think she could get away unless she backed up and g herself more room to turn.</p>
<p>She backed up and then she accelerated in front, you know, sort of moving along the side of the agents. So, we&#x27;ll hear from those agents, I&#x27;m sure. But this is very dangerous. This is very dangerous. Here&#x27;s the New York Times.</p>
<p>Minneapolis was the site of some of the most destructive unrest in recent American history in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd. Local officials have called for peace in the hours and days ahead. People are going to be upset about what happened, Chief O&#x27;Hara said. And people are going to want to exercise their First Amendment rights, but please do so safely and lawfully to ensure that we do not have any further tragedy in the city or destruction. My understanding is that there was this presser at which the police chief made those comments just now.</p>
<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, they did identify the woman driving the truck as a middle-aged white woman. We believe the cop was white, too, or the DHS employees. So, this does not at this hour appear to involve any sort of racial element, which of course was behind those protests that blew up Minneapolis back in late May, June 2020 after George Floyd was killed. Um, they won&#x27;t exercise caution. The media is not going to do that.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ll see what happens in the days and hours ahead uh in Minneapolis. But this thing is going to be with us for a for a while. Okay. And before we go, we just got another video in of this incident and it&#x27;s a much more clear version of what happened and why this thing went south. I&#x27;m going to show it to you quickly at first uh just at regular speed.</p>
<p>I think this is from the local ABC. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s got the ABC 5 watermark on it. Um and then we&#x27;re going to slow it down and talk about it. But just to set the stage again, what we see from the one angle is the cop dressed in gray, the cop dressed in black come out of their car, approach her car, and they&#x27;re basically standing by the driver&#x27;s side window. But the person who we believe fired the shot appears seemingly out of nowhere from that vantage point, which is back behind the DHS uh pickup truck that has pulled up.</p>
<p>it. We believe it may have been the wife, we&#x27;re told, of the woman who got shot. Maybe, maybe not her video, but the point is it&#x27;s from the vantage point of behind the maroon SUV and on the driver&#x27;s side. What you don&#x27;t see is a vantage point from the front of her SUV or the passenger side. So, we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening there.</p>
<p>And all we do know is that we believe the cop who opened fire came from there. So why did he? Well, it&#x27;s not clear from that first video, but this video just in she seems to shed more light on it here. Let&#x27;s watch it at regular speed. All right, so stand by. Can see a cop right there.</p>
<p>And there goes her car. She gets shot and then her car goes into a car nearby because she&#x27;s no longer in control of it. Okay, we&#x27;re going to slow it down though. Let&#x27;s slow it down because now we see where that third cop came from. He came from the front of her SUV.</p>
<p>He was in the road as her SUV accelerated toward him. Stand by here. You can see it. There he is. He&#x27;s right there.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s standing in the road and her car comes for him. And it appears to be that then that he opened fire. Okay. So, look right here. Right here, you can see a cop dressed in black.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s standing right there. Her car comes. He&#x27;s he tries to get out of the way. And that&#x27;s when we believe he opened fire. Let&#x27;s watch it again.</p>
<p>See the silver car that&#x27;s parked? He&#x27;s standing there in the road. Here comes her car. You can see him brace. He moves out of the way and we believe opened fire. I&#x27;m sorry, but this is very supportive of the police&#x27;s story.</p>
<p>Um, there still will be a debate on whether he should have shot, he should have opened fire, but this does support the statement that he felt he was about to get run over and that&#x27;s why he drew his firearm. Um, this will change the story considerably for anybody who&#x27;s honest and wants to do a fair assessment of what happened in Minneapolis rather than just distract from, let&#x27;s say, your political problems, Tim Walls, who just issued a statement that reads, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the video. Don&#x27;t believe this propaganda machine. The state will ensure there is a full affair and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.&quot; Okay. and he&#x27;s saying he&#x27;s retweeting the Homeland Security statement when he says, &quot;Don&#x27;t believe this propaganda machine.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, Governor Walls, but you need to look at this tape from all angles before you make a judgment.&quot; Um, that&#x27;ll do it for us today. We will have more on this for sure tomorrow. Thanks for listening.</p>
