            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>International news sparks heated discussion. The United States once again imposes chip sanctions on China, completely banning the export of high-end chips. Meanwhile, a massive meteor shower, a once- ina century event appeared in the skies above the Great Sea Kingdom tonight. These news reports have once again plunged the chip technology sector of the Great Sea Kingdom into crisis. However, in the great Sia Kingdom at the National University of Defense Technology in dormatory 2011 for male students, the US is imposing these sanctions again.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong angrily handed the news tablet to Lynn. Old Lynn, with your abilities, why are you choosing to work on chips instead of going to the Weapons and Equipment Research Institute? Fatty Wong chuckled. The man insisted, &quot;As long as I can contribute to the country&#x27;s scientific and technological progress, it doesn&#x27;t matter where I go.&quot; He walked to the balcony where the light of a meteor shower streaked across the night sky. I trade my roommates&#x27;s 50 years of single life for the great Sia kingdom to break through its chip blockade. The instant he made his wish, an invisible beam of light shot toward his head.</p>
<p>A mechanical voice echoed in my mind. A suitable host has been found. The seed for the inheritance of the ninth level Chinese civilization in the universe has been successfully bound. What&#x27;s going on? Lynchin was taken aback. The inheritance seed is bound and cannot be removed.</p>
<p>Level 9 seeds of Chinese civilization inheritance. What are these? The seeds of Chinese civilization inheritance aimed to rapidly cultivate outstanding citizens. The inheritance seed comes with its own inheritance space which the host can enter to learn more. Lynchin immediately realized that this was the legendary golden finger. He decided to go back to his dorm and learn more about it later.</p>
<p>When Fatty Wong saw him return, he asked in confusion, &quot;Old Lynn, weren&#x27;t you going to see the meteor shower? I finished reading.&quot; Lynchin climbed into bed. I&#x27;ll rest first. Keep your voice down. He closed his eyes and silently recited, &quot;Enter the inheritance space.&quot; In an instant, Lynchin&#x27;s consciousness was pulled into a vast and boundless space. The space was so huge, he looked around in awe.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the inheritance space is to allow the host to inherit the technology of civilizations from level one to level 9. Currently, he can only access technologies of civilizations below level one, while Earth&#x27;s technology level is only level 0.8. Only one technology can be selected for inheritance at a time, and each technology needs to be designed, manufactured, and certified in the laboratory of the inheritance space. Amazing, Lynn Chun exclaimed, his heart filled with anticipation. If these technologies could be successfully passed down and handed over to the nation, the great Sia Kingdom would rapidly take off.</p>
<p>Lynchin became even more resolute in his previous choice. Please select the first option, technological inheritance, complete quantum chip technology, complete technology for super solid state magnetic field batteries, complete technology for high energy laser weapons, complete technology for electromagnetic rail guns. Lynchin did not hesitate and chose the complete quantum chip technology. The great Sea Kingdom has long been subject to the control of others in the field of chips and AI computing power chips are particularly important. A vast amount of information flooded Lin Shen&#x27;s mind from basic theories to complex designs and then to lithography machine production technology.</p>
<p>Two hours later, he mastered quantum chip technology. Lynn Shan was shocked. Compared to quantum chips, siliconbased chips were simply insignificant. With quantum chips, great sia will definitely be able to overtake others. Eagle just wait for the counter sanctions.</p>
<p>A determined light shown in Lin Chen&#x27;s eyes. Next, the practical part. Manufacturing a quantum lithography machine and designing a quantum chip. Lynn Shun, full of confidence, began working busily in the laboratory. Outside, he entered a deep sleep and his body was undergoing changes.</p>
<p>The next day in dormatory 211, sunlight streamed onto Lin Chens bed. Fatty Wong glanced at the bed opposite him. Why is old Lynn up later than me? Fatty Wong walked over and nudged Lin Shan with his elbow. Old Lynn, get up or there won&#x27;t be any breakfast left. Lynch still didn&#x27;t respond.</p>
<p>The fat man&#x27;s heart tightened. He reached out and touched Lynch&#x27;s nose to confirm he was still breathing. He wondered if Lynchin had been hit on the head by a meteor shower and hurriedly took out his phone to call 120. Suddenly, Lynchin opened his eyes wide. Don&#x27;t hit me.</p>
<p>The fat man was startled. You scared me to death. Lynchin sat up and stretched. I&#x27;m in deep sleep. Understand? Deep sleep? Sleeping for 12 hours.</p>
<p>The fat man didn&#x27;t believe him. Lynchin coughed once. All right, leave me alone. After washing up, Lynchin sat down at the computer and suddenly felt his mind was exceptionally clear. Could it be a change brought about by the inheritance of the seed? Lynchin was delighted.</p>
<p>He began to write feasibility study of quantum lithography technology as his graduation project. Fatty Wong leaned over for a look. Old Lynn, did you get hit by a meteor last night? Are you working on your graduation project with a quantum lithography machine? Quantum lithography machine? The fat man scoffed. That&#x27;s just a concept. No country can actually build one, Lynn Chun explained earnestly.</p>
<p>The US is blocking our chip technology. They have too many silicon-based chip patents, so quantum chips are the easiest to implement. The fat man nodded. All right, Lynn. I look forward to your results.</p>
<p>Lynchin was focused on writing and did not respond. For the next 10 days, Lynchin wrote proposals during the day and worked in the inheritance space to build a lithography machine at night. In the space of inheritance, he repeatedly optimized and started over. Finally, on the ninth night, Lynch completed the design of the quantum lithography machine and successfully verified it. Finally finished, Lynchin breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Thanks to the optimization of the inheritance space, a lot of time could be saved in reality. The next day, Lynchin began a final check of the quantum lithography machine feasibility study. He reviewed the document repeatedly to ensure there were no problems. Lynchin breathed a sigh of relief and sent an email to his mentor. Meanwhile, in the faculty apartment of the National University of Defense Technology, Lynchin&#x27;s adviser, Luod, sat in front of his computer looking at a pile of unsatisfactory graduation projects until he saw the email from Lynch.</p>
<p>Lynch, why is he getting involved in all this fancy stuff? Rody frowned. He knew Lyn Shan was an excellent student, but quantum lithography machines were not something a student could make. Why did this kid take such a shady path? Rody thought with some disappointment. So he opened the email. Rody opened the email.</p>
<p>From the first page, the surprise on his face quickly turned into shock. This is incredible. It&#x27;s actually possible. As Professor Luo continued to examine the exhibits, he became increasingly astonished. From the theoretical design of the quantum lithography machine to the detailed parameters of each component, the content is exceptionally detailed and supported by ample data.</p>
<p>After reviewing the entire proposal, Professor Lus hands trembled slightly. Lyn Shan, I misunderstood you. You truly are a genius. He apologized to Lyn Shan in his heart for his previous doubts. Never expecting that this plan would be so feasible.</p>
<p>How did Lynchin do that? Even the National University of Defense Technology doesn&#x27;t have the facilities to conduct experiments like that. He decided to have the experts at the Seyaku Academy review the proposal. He sent the email confidentially to Lee Aigua at the Seyaku Academy and also called Director Lee. The phone rang 40 seconds before being answered. Oldly check your email right away.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve sent you a lithography machine solution that could revolutionize the entire chip industry, disrupt the entire chip industry. Are you drunk? Li Jian Guo said impatiently. Our EUV light source here has been stuck for half a year. Meanwhile, in the lithography machine research laboratory of the Sia Academy of Sciences, severalademicians with gray hair sat there. It&#x27;s still a failure.</p>
<p>Academician Jeang looked at the experimental data. The US has added five more materials to its embargo list, and we can&#x27;t even achieve five layers of stability. Without alternatives, a breakthrough seems a long way off, academician Joe. They have been working hard for domestically produced high-end lithography machines, but the current predicament makes them feel frustrated. Keep going and one day we&#x27;ll break through.</p>
<p>Academician Jang remains steadfast. Just then, Lie Jiano entered. Academician Jang asked with concern, &quot;Old Lee, what&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Lie Jian Guo shook his head. It&#x27;s La Luo from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. He said a student named Lin Shun had developed a feasibility study for quantum lithography machines and wanted me to take a look.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo sat back down at his computer and opened his emails. The BCC emails were particularly eye-catching. He clicked on one and flipped to the first page. Oldly utadmission Jang asked as he walked over. Lie Jian Guoo pulled the computer to the middle.</p>
<p>Come and take a look. What shocked you so much? Academission Jang asked. Everyone crowded around and their expressions changed instantly after seeing the plan. Is this really a proposal written by a student? Academician Jeang asked incredulously. Quick, next page.</p>
<p>Academician Zhao urged impatiently. Old Lee, stopped shaking. Hurry up. Academician Xiao urged. Lie Jian Guo calmed himself down and continued turning the pages while the expressions of theademicians kept changing.</p>
<p>Two hours later, they finally finished reviewing the entire plan. Was this plan really written by a student? Academician Jang was shocked. Oldly perhaps we should run it on a supercomput. Academician Xiao suggested. Input the parameters.</p>
<p>Wait for the results. Get the results in 3 minutes. Don&#x27;t let us down. 3 minutes later. The result came back.</p>
<p>Feasible. Then red text flashed. Core technical parameters missing. Complete simulation impossible. Haha.</p>
<p>It really can happen. Great. The chip industry is saved this time. The lack of core technology seems to be intentional on the part of that genius. At 1:00 a.m., Lie Jian Guo couldn&#x27;t wait to go find someone.</p>
<p>Just as Lie Jian Guo was about to rush out, academician Jean grabbed him. Oldly, it&#x27;s so late now. If you go to the school, no one will open the door for you. Academician Xiao also advised, &quot;Yes, Lai. Rushing to the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences might attract attention and cause big trouble.&quot; Lie Jian Guoo sat back down, his eyes filled with resentment.</p>
<p>What can we do? I won&#x27;t feel at ease until I get the data. He knew the plan was feasible, and the sooner he got the final plan, the sooner he could feel at ease. Academician Joe suggested, &quot;We can proceed in two steps. First, contact the National Security Bureau to have someone seal Professor Luod&#x27;s computer and have him sign a confidentiality agreement. Second, apply for a special appointment letter overnight to recruit Lin Shun to our institute.</p>
<p>If the project is feasible, let him take charge of the quantum lithography machine project directly. Lie Jang Wu nodded, &quot;Okay, do as you say. I&#x27;ll make the call.&quot; He dialed the number of Jeang Jun Feay, the director of the security bureau, and briefly explained the situation. A few minutes later, Lie Jian Guo received all of Lin&#x27;s information. Lynn Shun, male, 23 years old, orphan, top scorer in the college entrance examination, graduate student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s an orphan, Lee Jian Guo remarked. Academician Jang sighed. I never expected him to be a genius. No wonder he could write such an outstanding graduation thesis. At 1:40 a.m., downstairs at the faculty apartment building of the National University of Defense Technology, two black sedans quietly pulled up.</p>
<p>Three men in black suits got out of the car and showed their identification. We&#x27;re from the security bureau looking for Professor Roddy. Rody had just finished washing up and laid down when he heard a knock on the door. Who&#x27;s looking for me so late? He opened the door and saw three men in suits. Comrades, what can I do for you? The leader flashed his badge.</p>
<p>Professor Rody, we are from the security bureau. We need your cooperation regarding your student Lin Chin&#x27;s graduation project. Rody paused for a moment, then realized Lie Jian Guo must have seen the plan. Rody did not suspect their identities. The security personnel were clearly identified.</p>
<p>They entered the apartment and went straight to the computer. Is this your work computer? Is that graduation project email in there? The security officer asked. Yes. Rody nodded. We&#x27;ve sealed the computer.</p>
<p>The man in the suit picked up the computer, affixed a seal, and handed over an agreement. This is a confidentiality agreement. Please sign it. Rody was shocked when he saw the word top secret on the cover. He had never signed a confidentiality agreement of this level before.</p>
<p>He quickly signed the papers and the security personnel took away the computer and the confidentiality agreement. Rody returned to his room and sent Lynn Chin a short message. At 7:00 a.m. the next morning, at the gate of the National University of Defense Technology, President Chin Haning and Professor Luod were waiting. Soon the three cars slowly came to a stop and Lie Jian Guo, academician Jang and academician Xiao got out one after another followed by four security bureau personnel including director Jeang Jun Fei.</p>
<p>Chun Honing quickly went up to them. Academician Lee, Academician Jang, Academian Xiao. Hello. Hello, Principal Chun. Lee Jiang Guo responded, then looked at Lu D.</p>
<p>Old Luo, shall we go find Linshin? Chinhaning was somewhat surprised looking for Lynch. had he come up with some major technological breakthrough again. Luod nodded. Let&#x27;s go. I&#x27;ll take you there.</p>
<p>Soon they arrived at dormatory 2011. Rody knocked on the door. Lynn Shanun, opened the door. The door opened and Fatty Wong stood in the doorway, shocked to see the group enter. Please come in everyone.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong hurriedly opened the door. Lyn Shun had just finished washing up when he saw Li Jian Guo and the others come in and instantly understood what was going on. Lynshan, these are academician Lee, academian Xiao, and academician Jang. Luod introduced first. HelloMissians.</p>
<p>Hello, President. Lynch responded politely. Lie Jian Guo sized up Lin Chan then took out a letter of appointment from his briefcase. Lyn Shan, on behalf of the Sia Academy of Sciences, I hereby appoint you as a special researcher of the Sya Academy of Sciences. This is the letter of appointment.</p>
<p>Lynchin finally received his special appointment from the Sia Academy of Sciences. He accepted the letter of appointment saying, &quot;Thank you all. I accept this special appointment.&quot; Lie Jian Guo smiled, &quot;Is it convenient for you to come with us now?&quot; Lynchin nodded, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ll pack quickly.&quot; 2 minutes later, Lynchin left with them, telling Fatty Wong before he left, &quot;Wait for me at the Sia Academy of Sciences.&quot; When Wong Pongi came to his senses, he found that there were still two men in suits in the dormatory, one of whom was Jeang Jun Feay. Seeing a man in a suit closed the door, Fatty Wong asked nervously, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Jeang Jun Fe hurly explained, &quot;We are from the Security Bureau. We just want you to sign a confidentiality agreement.&quot; &quot;The State Security Bureau? A confidentiality agreement?&quot; Fatty Wong suddenly realized, &quot;I&#x27;ll sign it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll sign it.&quot; Jeang Jun Feay said sternly. Remember, you can&#x27;t tell anyone about Lin Chin&#x27;s matter. You signed a top secret agreement. If you leak it, you&#x27;ll be locked up for life, and it might even implicate your family. Fatty Wong nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>I will. I absolutely won&#x27;t tell. Jeang Jun Feay gave him another instruction before leaving with his staff. Just then, several classmates walked in and asked, &quot;Fatty, why was Lynchin taken away?&quot; Fatty Wong instinctively wanted to respond, but then remembered the confidentiality agreement and changed his answer, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; In the principal&#x27;s office, Chun Honing stared at Luod D. Old Luo, can you talk now? Lu D smiled Riley.</p>
<p>Principal, we signed a top secret agreement and I can&#x27;t reveal any information. A top secret agreement? Chinhaning gasped. He quickly arranged for the school to block all information about Lin Chan. On the way back to the Xiaku Academy, Dean Lee, academician Jang, and academician Xiao kept asking Lynchin about his technical solutions. As Lynchin patiently explained things, they gradually realized his talent.</p>
<p>Even technical problems that they couldn&#x27;t understand, Lynch could explain in a single sentence. Lie Jang Wos eyes were full of admiration. As they approached the Xiaku Academy, Lie Jian Guo asked seriously, &quot;Shaolin, are you sure the plan can be implemented?&quot; Lyn Shan answered firmly. Yes, it&#x27;s 100% guaranteed to succeed. Lie Jang Wos eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>If we succeed, we can break through the US sanctions. Lynchin nodded. It will definitely succeed. His purpose in coming to the Sea Academy of Sciences is to use these technologies to help the great Sia Kingdom become stronger. Upon arriving at the Seyaku Academy, Dean Lee arranged accommodations and then led Lynchin directly to the conference room.</p>
<p>The conference room was filled withademicians and scientists. Lie Jang Wuo introduced, &quot;This is academician Jang in the field of chip engineering, academician Joe in the field of material science, and academician Xiao in the field of opto electronics.&quot; Lynchan bowed and said, &quot;Greetings, fellowmishians. My name is Lynch.&quot; An academician surnamed Son questioned, &quot;Old Lee, is this the genius you were talking about?&quot; Li Jango laughed and said, &quot;Old son, don&#x27;t worry. He had his staff distribute confidentiality agreements and theademicians were shocked to see that they were top secret. They signed immediately expressing their honor to participate in discussions of this level.</p>
<p>The meeting began with Lynn Shin&#x27;s quantum lithography machine solution being displayed on the large screen. Quantum lithography machine. Academician son exclaimed in surprise. We haven&#x27;t even solved the EUV lithography machine problem. How can we talk about a quantum lithography machine? As the proposal was presented, the doubts gradually subsided and theademicians expressions became complex.</p>
<p>Was this really written by a student? After the proposal was presented, themissionians fell into deep thought. Li Jang Guoo observing their reactions felt a surge of pride. Everyone, we&#x27;ve reviewed the plan. Any questions? Lie Jian Guo asked. Academicians son spoke up.</p>
<p>Lynshan, I have a technical question. After Lynshan explained with a smile, Academicians son felt enlightened. Academicians son stood up and bowed to Lynch. Lynshan hurly helped him up. Academicians son, it&#x27;s my honor to be able to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Academicians son patted him on the shoulder. Good boy. May God bless great Sia. Shortly after, Lieua announced, &quot;Project Oregon is hereby established to fully develop a quantum lithography machine.&quot; At the same time, Lynshin has been appointed as the project&#x27;s chief engineer, responsible for all technical guidance. The Oregon project kickoff meeting concluded, and the project officially commenced the following day.</p>
<p>Although the lithography machine issue had been resolved, the quantum chip design had to start from scratch. Half a month later, with Lynchin&#x27;s technical support, the quantum lithography machine project progressed rapidly, and many parts had begun to be processed and assembled according to the process flow. That day, Lieua and Lynn Shan came to the laboratory. Lieua exclaimed, &quot;Linn, the quantum lithography machine will be completed in a month.&quot; Lynch confidently stated, &quot;Assembly should be completed in at most half a month.&quot; Lieua exclaimed in surprise, &quot;So fast? Doesn&#x27;t that mean mass production is possible?&quot; Lynchin nodded, &quot;As long as the assembly process of the first unit is successful, mass production can begin.&quot; Li was suddenly realized the issue of the manufacturer. Since Linshin&#x27;s project was entirely under his control, the manufacturer had to be carefully considered to ensure Linshin&#x27;s personal interests.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll take care of the manufacturer&#x27;s issues,&quot; Liigua assured him. Lynchin replied, &quot;I just want the quantum lithography machine to be able to go into mass production smoothly. That would be the best. The lithography machine assembly is progressing smoothly, even faster than scheduled.&quot; Lynn Shun is also busy optimizing the design process for the quantum chip, bringing it to the final stages. Soon, we&#x27;ll be able to unlock the next technological inheritance soon.</p>
<p>Lynchin thought to himself with anticipation. However, Lynshin gradually discovered that with the technological accumulation of the inheritance space, his physical fitness and brain development were also improving simultaneously. In just one month, his physical condition was close to that of a sports student, and his thinking was also more agile. That evening, as Lynchin passed by the door, he overheard someone on the phone discussing energy issues, mentioning new energy transformation and battery range. Lynshin thought of the super solid magnetic field battery on the inheritance list, a technology that might solve the current new energy problem.</p>
<p>He decided to choose super solid state magnetic field battery as his next technological legacy to contribute to the country&#x27;s new energy transformation. Back in his dormatory, Lyn Shun washed up and entered the inheritance space to begin manufacturing quantum chips. The quantum lithography machine was started and the entire manufacturing process proceeded smoothly and precisely. Finally, a 1 nanometer quantum chip with a faint glow was successfully completed. Lynch clenched his fist excitedly.</p>
<p>The notification sound from the inheritance space rang out. Congratulations host on completing the quantum chip manufacturing and unlocking the next technological inheritance. Please choose freely. Lynchin did not rush to choose the next technology but continued to test the performance of the quantum chip he designed. After a series of tests, the results surprised him greatly.</p>
<p>The performance of this one nanometer quantum chip is 100 times that of the most advanced chips on the market such as the Apple and Apple chips. Even under highintensity usage, the heat generation is only 1% completely solving the problems of heat generation and battery life. Excellent. Lynch was full of confidence in his design. Once it goes into mass production, it will definitely break through the US blockade.</p>
<p>With that in mind, he decided to choose the next technological legacy. I choose super solid state magnetic field battery. As soon as he finished speaking, technical data on the super solid state magnetic field battery flooded his mind. Lynch enclosed his eyes to process it and the ingenuity of the technology left him in awe. The parameters of the super solid state battery greatly surprised him.</p>
<p>Its volume is onetenth that of current batteries on the market, but it can achieve a range of 5,000 km with just 5 minutes of charging. Even more impressive is the battery stability in harsh environments. It can function normally even at -7° C. With this technology, the new energy industry of great sea will directly lead the world, Lynchin thought excitedly, and the problem of energy imports can also be solved. Next, he began hands-on practice in the laboratory of the inherent space.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process of super solidstate batteries is much simpler than that of quantum chips. The next day, Lynching got up at 7:00 a.m. sharp, washed up quickly, ate some breakfast, and went to the laboratory. As soon as he entered, he was shocked by the scene before him. Dozens of engineers surrounded the lithography machine, their tired eyes revealing that they hadn&#x27;t slept all night.</p>
<p>Academicians son, wearing reading glasses, was tightening the last screw, while Li Jian Guo stood beside him, his face serious. Shaolin, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. We&#x27;ve just finished the last step of assembly. Lie Jian Guo greeted Lynchin excitedly as he entered so fast. Lynchin immediately thought, &quot;You guys stayed up all night last night?&quot; &quot;Yes, to finish as soon as possible.&quot; Lie Jian Guo nodded.</p>
<p>Lynchin walked to Academicians son&#x27;s side and said softly, &quot;Professor Son, how about I do the final step?&quot; Academicians son looked up, his eyes bloodshot. After a moment&#x27;s hesitation, he nodded. &quot;All right, let Chief Engineer Lynn complete the final step.&quot; Lynchin took the tools, carefully tightened the last few screws and checked them several times. After confirming that everything was correct, he walked to the main control panel of the lithography. Are you sure the power is stable? He turned to confirm.</p>
<p>Stable? Lie Jian Guo replied. Good. Lynchin took a deep breath and pressed the start button. Suddenly, the indicator light on the quantum chip lithography machine lit up and the self- test progress bar on the screen began to jump. Self test started.</p>
<p>10%, 20%, 30%, 100%. Self test complete. Machine is functioning normally and is preparing to enter working mode. As these words appeared, a cheer erupted, and the laboratory erupted in jubilation. Great, we did it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s unclear who made the first move, but several people picked up Lynch, tossed him into the air, and caught him safely, celebrating their exciting achievement. The hard work of this past month has brought tremendous progress to everyone. This is the most precious reward. The atmosphere in the conference room was pleasant, filled with laughter. Them missians who had struggled to overcome sanctions were filled with emotion and respect.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lynn Chun was put down and staff rushed in. Director Lee Chief Engineer Lynn, look at this. He handed over a tablet. The above is a news article. In 2 weeks, the global semiconductor exhibition will be held in Shanghai.</p>
<p>But the comments from foreign media are unusually jarring. The Great Sa Kingdom can&#x27;t even build an EUV lithography machine. Yet, they dare to hold a semiconductor exhibition. Even if you give them the blueprints, they still can&#x27;t build a lithography machine. Lynch looked at the comments and smiled coldly.</p>
<p>Keep mocking me. You won&#x27;t be laughing for long. He turned to Li Jian Guo and asked, &quot;Mr. Lee, can we participate in this exhibition?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Lie Jian Guo nodded in agreement. &quot;Okay.&quot; Lynchin nodded emphatically, looking at the engineers with a determined gaze.</p>
<p>Produce the first batch of chips within 15 days and participate in the exhibition. Yes, all the engineers responded in unison, their eyes gleaming with determination. This exhibition was destined to reshape the global semiconductor landscape. As soon as cheers erupted in the laboratory, Li Jian Guo picked up his phone and dialed Dean Sia&#x27;s number. Dean, we want to participate in the Shanghai semiconductor exhibition.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn has promised to deliver the first batch of quantum chips within 15 days. The dean on the other end of the phone responded excitedly, &quot;Great. I&#x27;ll arrange it right away and give it my full support.&quot; The next morning, the official website of the Shaman Academy of Sciences announced that the Academy would showcase its independently developed quantum chip lithography machine and 1 nanometer quantum chip at the Shanghai Global Semiconductor Exhibition. The news caused an uproar online. really is a 1 nanometer quantum chip achievable.</p>
<p>However, foreign media and semiconductor companies have also begun to attack it, arguing that quantum chips are just a gimmick and impossible to achieve. However, Lynch and his team ignored these voices and focused on the production of quantum chips. For the next 15 days, the laboratory remained brightly lit with engineers working day and night. Li Jang Guoo kept a close eye on the raw material supply, not daring to relax for a single minute. On the morning of the 14th day, the tense atmosphere in the laboratory reached its peak.</p>
<p>Equipment is normal. Shall we begin production? The engineer asked Lynchin, turning around. Lynchin took a deep breath. Start. The lithography machine started and everyone stared nervously at the screen.</p>
<p>The progress bar slowly advanced, then suddenly stopped at 90%. Lie Jian Guo asked anxiously, and Lynchin immediately began the repair. It&#x27;s all right. Continue. Finally, the progress bar reached 100%.</p>
<p>The lithography machine&#x27;s finished product port opened and 1 nanometer quantum chips were successfully produced. Success. Cheers erupted in the lab and Lin Chun breathed a sigh of relief. Thank you, Lynn. Li Jang Wo said deeply moved.</p>
<p>Next up is the performance test. The data instantly displayed. Chip manufacturing process one nanometer. CPU performance 102 times that of the latest GTX CPU. GPU rendering 110 times that of Apple&#x27;s flagship chip.</p>
<p>Heat generation 1/100th, that of traditional chips. Yield rate 99%. Everyone gasped, marveling at the chip&#x27;s astonishing performance. Fantastic. We&#x27;ve retaliated against the sanctions this time.</p>
<p>Finally, we have our own high-end chip, Linshan said with a smile. This is just the beginning. Subsequent trial production batches were very stable, preparing for the exhibition. The next day, the Shanghai Global Semiconductor Exhibition opened. Inside the exhibition hall, foreign journalists and semiconductor company representatives gathered in front of a domestic company&#x27;s booth.</p>
<p>Where are the quantum chips from the China Academy of Science and Technology? Why can&#x27;t we see them? While the staff were embarrassed, a senior executive of Gaoong sneered. They weren&#x27;t prepared at all. They&#x27;re just here to make up the numbers. Foreign journalists also raised their cameras to mock. Their quantum chip must be made from a model.</p>
<p>Chapter nine. The storm rumble at the trade show. A turning point in the semiconductor industry. Just when everyone thought that Siaki Yuan had broken his promise, a commotion suddenly broke out at the entrance. Make way.</p>
<p>Make way. Everyone quickly turned their heads and saw Li Jian Guo walking in front, wearing a dark blue Jong Sean suit. The bloodshot eyes revealed his recent fatigue, but his steps were still steady. Behind him were two experts from the Sia Academy of Sciences and four staff members in black suits carrying silver briefcases with the words Academy of Sciences on them. Li Jang Wos arrival silenced the room instantly, but soon the atmosphere became lively again.</p>
<p>Great. The Academy of Sciences of Sa has finally arrived. I knew they wouldn&#x27;t let us down. It&#x27;s finally here. Those who had been anxious breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The SA Academy of Sciences had finally fulfilled its promise. Meanwhile, some continued to mock. So, what if you came? You&#x27;re just making a fool of yourself. If they could really create quantum chips, why has it taken so long? It&#x27;s just a formality. Faced with this ridicule, those around him almost couldn&#x27;t help but retaliate.</p>
<p>But in the end, they held back and only hurled a few insults back. At this moment, foreign media flocked to lead Gian Guo and Lin Shun. A BBC reporter asked, &quot;Amissionly, why are you late?&quot; A reporter from the Beijing News asked, &quot;Are there models in the box?&quot; An AFP reporter questioned, &quot;Do you really possess quantum chip technology?&quot; Semiconductor executives around him sneered. And one executive even mocked, &quot;If a one nanometer quantum chip can be made, I&#x27;ll crawl back to America.&quot; SML executives observed coldly. &quot;The Great Sa Kingdom simply doesn&#x27;t have the conditions to manufacture such chips.&quot; Lie Jian Guoo and Lin Shun remained unmoved and calmly replied, &quot;You&#x27;ll know when we get to the booth.&quot; They walked toward the booth and the staff quickly opened the safe.</p>
<p>Click. The moment the box was opened, everyone held their breath. Inside the transparent container laid dozens of faintly glowing chips, each smaller than a fingernail, exuding an air of mystery. &quot;This is a quantum chip. Have you really achieved a one nanometer quantum chip?&quot; Domestic audiences were thrilled while foreign media and executives continued to mock and ridicule.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Ichiro, a senior executive at Doning Electronics, laughed and said, &quot;The counterfeiting level of the great Sia Kingdom has improved again. If it&#x27;s true, I&#x27;ll eat while standing on my head.&quot; Lie Jian Guo calmly responded. This is our independently developed one nanometer quantum chip. He listed the chips parameters one by one. Chip manufacturing process 1 nanometer.</p>
<p>GPU rendering 110 times higher than Apple&#x27;s. CPU performance 102 times higher than Gaongs. Heat generation 1/100 of traditional chips. Yield 99%. Each parameter elicited gasps of surprise from the audience.</p>
<p>The cheers from the crowd were deafening. Incredible. We&#x27;ve actually made a one nanometer quantum chip. Let the Americans die. This time it&#x27;s our turn to retaliate.</p>
<p>These words were exhilarating. All the previous grievances and anger were transformed into excited shouts. Foreign media immediately raised questions. Impossible. How could a one nanometer quantum chip be achieved? You don&#x27;t even have a quantum lithography machine.</p>
<p>So, how do you produce chips? ASML executives rushed forward, pointed at the chip, and shouted, &quot;This is a fake. It&#x27;s 3D printed.&quot; Lie Jiano remained calm and gestured to his staff to play the video. The video showed the entire process from production to completion. Exactly the same parameters he had just reported. An explosion erupted at the scene and the cheers grew even louder.</p>
<p>Who would dare to question it now? Yu who just said you were going to crawl back to America. Now crawl. When will Yamamoto Ichiro eat on live stream? Domestic audiences were excited while foreign journalists frantically snapped photos. The executive at Gaoong stared at the screen, unable to believe what he was seeing. He staggered backward, accidentally falling to the ground, muttering, &quot;This must be fake.&quot; The ASML people were pale.</p>
<p>They had said they couldn&#x27;t even make a lithography machine. But now, the great Sia Kingdom had not only made one, but had also produced chips directly. Yamamoto Ichiro of Tonging Electronics. His face ashen shouted, &quot;This must be fake.&quot; People around him avoided him, afraid that he would bite them. Chapter 10.</p>
<p>Postexhibition turmoil. The frenzy of domestic mobile phone manufacturers. Yamamoto Ichiro was still shouting loudly. This is fake news. It must be AI generated.</p>
<p>Are the great Sia people only capable of such hypocritical tricks? But nobody paid him any attention. Foreign executives and media all kept their distance. Although they had doubts, they were not ashamed as they thought. They quickly relayed the message back to headquarters to verify its authenticity and prepare a response. Ultimately, Yamamoto was taken away by employees of Dong Jing Electronics.</p>
<p>People around were talking about it, saying that Japan had lost face. Lie Jian Guo didn&#x27;t care at all. Director Lee, we&#x27;ve achieved our goal. Are we ready to go back? An expert asked. Lie Jian Guo looked outside and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s wait a little longer and show our chips to the people of our country.&quot; The experts nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>They were filled with pride. All of this is for national rejuvenation to give the country confidence on the world stage. At the same time, executives from domestic semiconductor companies also gathered around. Academicianly, this is Jeang from SMIC. I&#x27;m looking for cooperation.</p>
<p>Can we do contract manufacturing? Mr. Lee, we at Chong Yen can fully cooperate. We at Huah Hong are also willing to cooperate. These manufacturers are all eager to seek cooperation. The one nanometer quantum chip developed by the Syako Institute presents both opportunities and threats.</p>
<p>If they seize the opportunity, their company will take off. If they are outmaneuvered, they will be eliminated. The market is ruthless. Manufacturers have been waiting on the sidelines for a long time, and now it&#x27;s finally their turn to speak. Lie Jiano looked at them and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, everyone.</p>
<p>The Sea Academy of Sciences will have a special department to contact you. Just cooperate actively. We will ensure the cooperation proceeds smoothly. Cooperation is inevitable, but the government will also investigate the background of manufacturers to prevent the infiltration of foreign capital. Upon hearing this, the manufacturers nodded in understanding and hurriedly left to prepare for further discussions.</p>
<p>As the number of visitors to the exhibition increased, the quantum chip booth became extremely crowded and security personnel began to maintain order. in dormatory 211 at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Holy crap, Lynn really made a quantum chip. Fatty Wong watched the live stream and was utterly shocked. In just one and a half months, Lynchin achieved a technological breakthrough.</p>
<p>This world has gone mad, Fatty Wong exclaimed. In the president&#x27;s office at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinhan was shocked. Old Luo, is this the surprise you were talking about? I think so. Rody was also incredulous. He didn&#x27;t expect that Lin Shan would develop a 1 nanometer quantum chip in less than two months at the Syaku Academy.</p>
<p>This is incredible, Chun Honing exclaimed excitedly, slapping his thigh. The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences has finally produced a prodigy. Meanwhile, in the conference room of Pingching Huawei Terminal, the screen is playing a video of the exhibition. All the technical experts were shocked. After calming down, CEO Yu Ching Dong asked, &quot;Do you think the new phone will be compatible with this chip?&quot; &quot;Old Yu, do you mean to directly adapt this quantum chip to the new mobile phone?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go for it.&quot; Yuch Chong Dong said decisively. &quot;As long as we can get the samples, we can adapt them.&quot; &quot;Okay, contact the Seyako Institute right away and see if we can get a chips sample.&quot; Yuching Dong firmly stated that he would never again allow supply chain issues to hold him back. Other domestic mobile phone manufacturers also held meetings to discuss how to win over this chip. They see this as both a challenge and an opportunity and they must get the samples for testing as soon as possible. If the adaptation is successful, the performance will be greatly improved and it may even gain a leading edge in the market.</p>
<p>Representatives from various companies acted swiftly, sending people to the Shaman Academy of Sciences to negotiate and strive to seize the initiative in the technological competition. Chapter 11. Earth is in an uproar. The US intensifies sanctions. As time went by, Lie Jian Guo and his team had already left the exhibition, but the quantum chip and video were still on display, continuing to attract more Chinese visitors.</p>
<p>The exhibition was a huge success after the quantum chip was showcased, attracting visitors from all over the country. The crowds exceeded capacity, necessitating crowd control measures, demonstrating the immense enthusiasm this breakthrough ignited among the Chinese people. The internet was a buzz. The video quickly topped the trending charts and the comment section was filled with excited messages. My grandfather is a veteran semiconductor engineer and he was moved to tears while watching the video.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#x27;ve seen a breakthrough in the US sanctions. I&#x27;m so excited. When will they release a phone with a quantum chip? I&#x27;ll switch immediately. Where&#x27;s that high-ranking official from the CCP who said he wanted to climb back to America? Come out and climb back here right now. These comments caused the online buzz to skyrocket.</p>
<p>While domestic nizens were engaged in heated discussions, international nizens expressed considerable dissatisfaction. On Twitter, foreign nisens have raised numerous questions. How could we possibly manufacture one nanometer chips without EUV lithography machines? Dasha must have stolen the technology. The video is definitely fake. I analyzed it with software.</p>
<p>The light reflection is wrong. Implement sanctions immediately. Otherwise, our semiconductor industry will be finished. Some even spread rumors on domestic forums, saying, &quot;It might just be a one-time sample, and it&#x27;s impossible to mass-produce it at all.&quot; These comments were quickly refuted by netizens who had bypassed internet censorship. Syako Institute has already released the production video.</p>
<p>What are you still doubting? Meanwhile, chaos erupted inside the White House. President Oakley angrily demanded, &quot;How can they even build a 1 nanometer quantum chip? Give me an explanation.&quot; The Secretary of State hurriedly stepped forward. We have already sent agents to investigate and the results will be available soon. The president slammed his fist on the table in anger. Increased sanctions.</p>
<p>All materials related to chips, including screws, are prohibited from being sold to the Great Sa Kingdom. The purpose of the sanctions is clear. to hinder the development of quantum chips in the great sea kingdom through economic blockade. Shortly afterward, the countries in the US-led alliance issued announcements prohibiting the inflow of quantum chip products from the great sea kingdom. The announcement sparked another online uproar Has the US gone mad? Could the quantum chip from Great Sia be real? This sanction is good.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see how great Xiaom mass-produces chips. Even among the US-led coalition countries, many netizens still believe that China&#x27;s chips cannot be mass-produced, while netizens from China&#x27;s allies have condemned the sanctions. Technological bullying will be overturned sooner or later. Support the Great Sia Kingdom and we will surely break through the blockade. Faced with sanctions, nizens from the Great Sea Kingdom showed no fear and voiced strong patriotism.</p>
<p>The US thinks it can stop us. How naive. conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Schwang Go firmly stated on the podium, &quot;The sanctions imposed by countries such as the United States are unreasonable acts of hegemony. Our breakthroughs are the result of independent innovation, and there is absolutely no theft.&quot; His words strengthen the nation&#x27;s resolve to support domestically produced goods, and everyone eagerly awaited the market launch of quantum chip products.</p>
<p>At the same time, the stock prices of international semiconductor companies plummeted and some companies were suspended from trading, resulting in a loss of trillions of dollars in market value within just a few hours. Capitalists realized that the emergence of quantum chips would completely change the landscape of the semiconductor industry, causing domestic and foreign stock investors to lament their losses, with some even choosing to commit suicide due to excessive losses. This is just the beginning. The launch of the first quantum chip phone will completely shake the global market. At the Shaman Academy of Sciences, Lie Jian Guo was busy arranging matters related to quantum lithography machines and chip mass production.</p>
<p>After finishing the arrangements, he went to Linshins office and eagerly asked, &quot;Lynn, what was that new technology you mentioned before?&quot; Lynshin smiled and said, &quot;Super solid state magnetic field battery.&quot; Lie Jian Guo was completely baffled. What kind of technology is this? After Lin Chun gave a brief explanation, Li Jian Guo was astonished. 5 minutes of charging, 5,000 km of range. It can work normally even atus 70° C. That&#x27;s outrageous.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo slapped his thigh excitedly. This technology is amazing. He couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim, &quot;If such a battery really existed, it could be used in the military, especially in laser weapons.&quot; Chapter 12. The Schwan Wu Battery Project is established. military laser weapons.</p>
<p>Lin Chins eyes lit up. Perhaps it was something to consider. Lie Jian Guo became more and more excited as he spoke. If we increase the battery capacity, laser weapons can operate around the clock, and we won&#x27;t have to worry about energy issues anymore. The Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s laser weapon technology is worldleading.</p>
<p>Its only weakness is energy supply. Existing vehicle-mounted laser weapons can only operate for 10 minutes. But Lynchin&#x27;s super solid state magnetic field battery solution can completely solve this problem. Lie Jian Guo became more and more excited as he thought about it. Shaolin, let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll hold a technical seminar right away and launch the project. Lynchin knew that Lie Jian Guo was always so impatient. But it was precisely because of his impatience that he had achieved the current situation. He decided to deal with the quantum chip issue first. Mr.</p>
<p>Lee, calm down. The technology is with me. Don&#x27;t worry. Let&#x27;s get the quantum chip issue sorted out first. Lynchan said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s no rush with the quantum chip.</p>
<p>Several mobile phone manufacturers have already applied for sample adaptation,&quot; Lie Jian Guo explained. &quot;It seems these phone manufacturers are reacting quickly,&quot; Lynchan said with a smile. &quot;We support them. However, we demand that they release a phone priced around 1,000 yuan so that ordinary people can also use quantum chips.&quot; Lie Jian Guo nodded approvingly after hearing this. Okay, we will convey this request.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, I have another idea, Lynchin continued. To accelerate the design of mobile phone batteries using a new battery solution and adapt it to quantum chips. Great idea, but we need to take precautions to protect the technology. Lie Jian Guo immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, no one can take apart the battery I designed. Lynshin said confidently. That&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ll contact the phone manufacturers right away, hold a technical discussion meeting, and set up a project team. Lie Jian Guo left without waiting.</p>
<p>Lynshin began preparing technical documents. Pingchanging Huawei terminal company. Upon receiving the reply from the Shaman Academy of Sciences, Yuching Dong was overjoyed. That&#x27;s wonderful. The Shaman Academy of Sciences has agreed to provide quantum chips and will also launch a new battery.</p>
<p>quickly set up a public relations project team to adapt the chip and then do the adaptation when the battery comes out. Yuching Dong quickly made the arrangements. Other mobile phone manufacturers have also begun to urgently adapt their devices, striving to launch them as soon as possible. 2 p.m. Shaman Academy of Scienc&#x27;s conference room.</p>
<p>Battery engineers stared at the screen, marveling at the specifications. 5 minutes of charging, 5,000 km of range. That&#x27;s incredible. works normally at -70° C with zero degradation. This defies the common sense of physics.</p>
<p>The engineers were shocked. Lynchin explained, &quot;This is a brand new magnetic field energy storage technology completely different from traditional batteries. The country urgently needs it not only for mobile phones and automobiles, but also for military and aerospace applications.&quot; After hearing the introduction, the experts present were all impressed and filled with admiration for Lynch. Lie Jian Guo watched quietly from the side, sighing inwardly that choosing Lin Shun as a special appointee was the best decision he had ever made. The meeting moved into the QA session, and Linshin patiently answered each question until the evening when the meeting was nearing its end.</p>
<p>Lynch proposed the following. I propose the establishment of the Schwan Wu project which symbolizes stability, safety, and longevity just like our battery. Zhaoing was the first to stand up and applaud. Okay, I agree. I agree.</p>
<p>The other engineers chimed in with their support. Lie Jang Guo stood up and announced the Shuan Wu battery project is established with Lin Shun as the chief engineer and all resources will be allocated with priority. Chapter 13. Powerful solid-state battery for mobile phones. The Schwan Woo battery project officially launched and Lynchin settled into a routine of going back and forth between the lab and the inheritance space at night.</p>
<p>The inheritance of the super solid state magnetic field battery was nearing completion. Only the successful manufacturer of the last few batteries would unlock the next technological advancement. In reality, Lin Shan instructed engineers to prioritize the development of the mobile phone battery and strive to complete a sample within 5 days. Lynn Shan provided relevant process parameters and urged them to expedite the process as much as possible with research on other batteries to be conducted later. Suppliers were also required to deliver the necessary materials within 5 hours.</p>
<p>4 days later, the first mobile phone battery finally entered its final stage. Academician Zhao Ming excitedly stated, &quot;The magnetic field energy storage module has been installed according to the design and is awaiting testing.&quot; Very good. Let&#x27;s begin the test. Lynch nodded in acknowledgement. The test began and all the engineers held their breath as the data was presented one by one.</p>
<p>Charging time 5 minutes. Standby time 7 days. Low temperature and high temperature simulation test. No degradation. Safety test.</p>
<p>No fire or explosion. Every result excited the engineers. Success. Everyone cheered. The atmosphere reaching a climax.</p>
<p>Academicianhao slapped his thigh excitedly and said, &quot;If this battery is used in mobile phones, people will never need to carry power banks again.&quot; Lie Jian Guo looked at Lynch, &quot;This is just a mobile phone battery. It will only trigger an energy revolution when car batteries are developed.&quot; Lyn Shan confirmed that mobile phone batteries could be mass-produced quickly at a cost of only onetenth of the market price with astonishing efficiency. Mr. Lee, I hope to massproduce mobile phone batteries as soon as possible. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ve already found a manufacturer.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll just need to upgrade the production line,&quot; Lie Jian Guo replied. Lynchin looked at the engineers and said, &quot;Everyone, go back and rest for a day. Well continue working on the car battery tomorrow.&quot; The engineers all expressed their unwillingness to rest. But Lynshin said in a deep voice, &quot;You must rest for a day or I will stop the project.&quot; In the end, the engineers obeyed the order and went back to rest. Meanwhile, engineers at the Pingching Huawei Terminal Laboratory were facing a compatibility issue with quantum chips.</p>
<p>Yuching Dong was extremely anxious and realized he had to contact the Shaman Academy of Sciences for help. Xiao Academy of Sciences has agreed. Yuching Dong returned with good news. They will send a technical team with the data to Beijing. Huawei&#x27;s technical team quickly traveled to Beijing to connect with the Shaman Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Other mobile phone manufacturers face similar problems, some even more severe than Huawei&#x27;s. At the Siako Institute, Lin Shan was busy preparing for the car battery project. Lie Jian Guo came in to report. Shiaolin Huawei company has encountered a technical problem and needs our assistance. I&#x27;ll help, Lynch agreed.</p>
<p>After Lie Jiano left, Lyn Shun continued working, preparing to meet the challenges to come. Chapter 14. Warwick engineers stunned. A spy has been discovered. When the Huawei engineering team arrived at the Siako Institute, the staff asked them to sign a confidentiality agreement which surprised them.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t expect that I would have to sign a confidentiality agreement to come here for an exchange. They received the agreement and saw its strict terms. Although they had doubts, they still signed it as required. After the signing was completed, staff led them into the conference room and arranged for them to rest for a while. Soon after, Lie Jian Guo and Lynchin entered the laboratory.</p>
<p>Engineer Jang, the technical director of Huawei, quickly stood up to greet them. Academician Lee, hello. Lie Jian Guo smiled and waved for everyone to sit down. This is Chief Engineer Lin Shan, who is in charge of this technical exchange. Jeang and the other engineers looked at Lin Shun in surprise.</p>
<p>They had assumed he would be a seasoned expert, but to their surprise, the young man in front of them was the chief technical officer in charge of communication. Despite his doubts, engineer Jeang reached out and shook hands with Lin Shan and the others followed suit. &quot;Please sit down. Let&#x27;s get straight to the point and talk about the technical problems we&#x27;ve encountered.&quot; Lynchin said, &quot;Getting straight to the point, Jean turned on his computer and demonstrated the system chip compatibility issue.&quot; Chief engineer Lynn, &quot;We&#x27;ve encountered some trouble here.&quot; Lynchin examined it and pointed out the problem. This is wrong.</p>
<p>The connection point between the quantum chip and the phone. Jang S eyes lit up. That&#x27;s right. How come we didn&#x27;t think of that? Lynn Shun continued adjusting the code while the other engineers watched intently, their initial confusion gradually turning into amazement. So, this is how you write drivers.</p>
<p>The underlying logic is really simple, but I just couldn&#x27;t think of a starting point. Chief Engineer Lynn is simply amazing. Finally, Lynn Shin clicked run, and the error message on the screen disappeared, indicating successful adaptation. Jeang Gong exclaimed excitedly, &quot;It&#x27;s done.&quot; Chief engineer Lynn, you&#x27;re amazing. Lynn Shin humbly replied, &quot;We&#x27;ve just found the right direction.</p>
<p>There won&#x27;t be any problems with compatibility with other models.&quot; Later on, Mr. Jang expressed his gratitude. Mr. Lynn raised the issue of compatibility with the new battery, asking, &quot;Do you want to adapt the new battery now? The new battery has been successfully developed.&quot; Engineer Jeang was shocked. The battery project had only been initiated a few days ago, and it had already been developed.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded. It has passed the test and samples can be provided. Yes, we want it. Engineer Jeang agreed without hesitation. The staff brought five new battery samples, handed them to Mr.</p>
<p>Jeang and gave him instructions on how to make them compatible. We promise you we won&#x27;t let you down. Engineer Jang solemnly promised. After explaining some details, Lynchin left, and the Huawei team hurriedly left with the batteries. On the way back, the Huawei engineers were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Solid-state magnetic field batteries. This is definitely a revolutionary product. Huawei will definitely return to its peak this year. Engineer Jeang solemnly warned. Forget everyone you met today and don&#x27;t tell anyone.</p>
<p>All engineers solemnly promised to maintain strict confidentiality. Lynchin returned to his office and checked the news on his phone. A news report caught his attention. This afternoon, a new energy vehicle&#x27;s battery suddenly caught fire, causing eight vehicles to be destroyed. The comment section was filled with negative voices questioning the technology of domestically produced new energy vehicles.</p>
<p>Lynch&#x27;s eyes were determined. It seems we need to speed up the progress on car batteries. He knew that if such problems were not resolved as soon as possible, the public trust crisis in new energy electric vehicles would become an obstacle to the national energy strategy. Schwan Wu automotive battery must be launched as soon as possible. However, Lyn Shun was unaware that the visit of Huawei engineers to the Siaka Institute had been monitored by spies.</p>
<p>Chapter 15. Emergency. Tackling the problem of car batteries. Eagle Intelligence Center Chief. The latest intelligence from the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Huawei&#x27;s technical team entered the Syako Institute today and stayed for half a day. They seem to have taken some items with them, but it&#x27;s unclear what they are. Upon hearing this, Nire intelligence frowned. Warwick is going to the SEA Academy of Sciences. They&#x27;re going to adapt quantum chips.</p>
<p>N is worried that Warwick has remained standing despite multiple rounds of sanctions from the United States. Continue to intensify efforts and confirm the authenticity of the quantum chip as soon as possible. He solemnly instructed Huawei Terminal Lab. Jeang and his team entered the closed laboratory to begin adapting the quantum chip. The data shows 5 minutes of charging provides 70 days of battery life.</p>
<p>No degradation in low and high temperature tests. No change after 10 years of aging. Pass safety tests. Incredible. This is practically a super energy block.</p>
<p>Yu Ching Dong excitedly announced, &quot;Starting tomorrow, we will work in seclusion to complete the adaptation within half a month.&quot; All the engineers responded enthusiastically and prepared to enter a long-term closed off work environment. Xiaki Yuan. At the Schwan Wu Battery Project Laboratory, academicianhaing saw news footage of a new energy vehicle catching fire and angrily exclaimed, &quot;They&#x27;re blaming domestically produced batteries again.&quot; Lyn Shan turned off the video and said in a deep voice, &quot;Regardless of whether it&#x27;s our technology or not, we must accelerate the mass production of solid-state magnetic field batteries.&quot; He demonstrated the technical solution for car batteries, which improved safety. It is puncture resistant and can withstand temperatures up to 800° C. 800°.</p>
<p>The experts in the lab exclaimed in astonishment. This will revolutionize the entire battery industry. Lynchin said firmly, &quot;We will complete mass production testing within half a month.&quot; All the engineers were full of confidence and began to act quickly. Headquarters of a mobile phone company in Dunwan. Huawei went to the Shaman Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Will they be ahead of us in terms of compatibility? Don&#x27;t worry, it will take at least 3 to 5 years for the technology from the SIA Academy to be mass-produced. The boss dismissed it, saying, &quot;Well adapt it when mass production is mature.&quot; He overlooked one fact. Quantum chips are ready for mass production, and Huawei&#x27;s quantum chip phone will be released in the fall, which will soon shatter the boss&#x27;s confidence. Chapter 16. Pingua&#x27;s contempt.</p>
<p>Quantum chip phone launch. Pingua company headquarters conference room. CEO Mark looked at the message from the intelligence agency and sneered. Huawei wants to make quantum chip phones. That&#x27;s laughable.</p>
<p>The marketing director frowned. Is the information reliable? The CTO laughed. No need to even look. It&#x27;s definitely fake news. Great sa can&#x27;t even build a UV.</p>
<p>How could they possibly make quantum chips? I bet $100 they only have a model. Mark slammed his fist on the table and said arrogantly, even if we have a sample, what about our mass production capacity? Our Pingua supply chain covers 300 manufacturers worldwide. Can Huawei manufacture 100,000 units a year? By the time they solve their mass production problems, our A29 chip will be on the market soon. The executives burst into laughter. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Great technology is all just toys in a laboratory. Mark waved his hand. Don&#x27;t go too far. Dasha contributes 40% of the profits. Don&#x27;t push it too far.</p>
<p>Huawei is no threat. We have already occupied the international market. Mark adjourned the meeting. The hype surrounding quantum chips has gradually faded with only a few bloggers paying attention to them. Engineers at Huawei&#x27;s terminal division are working around the clock to adapt quantum chips and solid-state batteries.</p>
<p>With Lin Chin&#x27;s guidance, the adaptation work progressed smoothly, even exceeding expectations. Two weeks later, at the Huawei Terminal Lab, Yuching Dong and his engineers kept a close eye on the test results. Model: Huawei M60 Quantum Edition. Chip 1 nanometer quantum chip. Battery solid-state magnetic field battery.</p>
<p>Charging full charge in 5 minutes. 70 days of standby time. Performance 100 times the performance of top-of-the-line smartphones on the market. Safety undamaged after a 10-meter drop. Works normally at -85° C.</p>
<p>Test results. All items passed. It&#x27;s done. Y Chung Dong exclaimed excitedly. We succeeded, Jang and the other engineers cheered.</p>
<p>The most powerful quantum chip phone in history. We have finally escaped the sanctions imposed by the United States. Yu Ching Dong announced, &quot;The adaptation of quantum chip for mobile phones is complete. Next, we will do our best to ensure mass production and quality. The press conference is scheduled for September 10th, 10 days from now.&quot; All engineers responded enthusiastically and prepared for mass production.</p>
<p>Lynn Shan was reviewing high temperature test data in the Schwan Wu battery laboratory when his assistant knocked on the door. Chief engineer Lynn, the package from Huawei terminal has arrived. Lynshan placed the gift box on the table, opened it, and found a black mobile phone inside. He tested the phone and found it performed excellently. It boots up very quickly, has a standby time of 70 days, and the chip is perfectly compatible.</p>
<p>Lynn Shan was very satisfied with the phone and decided to make it his primary phone. The announcement released by Huawei on the internet has attracted widespread attention. September 10th, Shenzhen International Convention and Exhibition Center. Huawei&#x27;s full range of quantum chip powered mobile phones, a global debut. Chapter 17, the terrifying quantum chip phone.</p>
<p>At its press conference, Huawei not only announced the date, but also showcased an amazing battery life figure. 5 minutes of charging provides 70 days of standby time. Within just 10 minutes, the related announcement dominated the trending topics list. Huawei Quantum Phone 9.10 makes global debut. Quantum chip phone has a standby time of 70 days.</p>
<p>Pingu executives feel ashamed. The comment section of the trending topic is buzzing. Is this true? It&#x27;s only been a short time since it went into mass production and hit the market. That&#x27;s too fast. I thought I&#x27;d have to wait a year or two.</p>
<p>It was already developed a long time ago, and this is just a formality. If it&#x27;s true, I&#x27;ll replace my Apple immediately. Most people were surprised and excited by Huawei&#x27;s announcement, choosing to believe in Huawei and support the technological breakthroughs of the great Sia Kingdom. But there are always some rats stirring things up behind the scenes. Don&#x27;t hype it up too soon.</p>
<p>It might be a PowerPoint presentation phone, and you won&#x27;t be able to buy it even if it&#x27;s released. Don&#x27;t fool me. Great SEA can&#x27;t even manufacture EUV. How can it mass-produce quantum chips? These comments were quickly refuted by netizens. You just can&#x27;t stand to see the country doing well, can you? On September 10th, everyone is looking forward to the surprise that Huawei will bring.</p>
<p>At the same time, domestic mobile phone companies are increasing their investment in preparation for the challenges. At the headquarters of a shady factory in Dunuan, the boss and executives looked grim. Huawei has completed the adaptation, an executive said in a low voice. Impossible, the boss slammed his fist on the table. This must be a smoke screen.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, he said that the technology developed by the China Academy of Sciences would take three to five years to realize. How come he&#x27;s releasing a quantum phone now? Let&#x27;s contact the Shaman Academy of Sciences as well, an executive suggested. First, confirm Huawei&#x27;s production capacity, the boss ordered through gritted teeth. Our D department prepare to allocate half of your manpower for adaptation. Other manufacturers have also increased their investment and begun to seek help from the Shaman Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>At this moment, the atmosphere at the Pingua headquarters was even more somber. Huawei&#x27;s factory has at least five production lines working over time,&quot; the marketing director reported. Mark couldn&#x27;t believe it. &quot;How can there be so many?&quot; The technical director looked worried. &quot;If Huawei uses quantum chips, our A28 chips won&#x27;t even be a fraction of what they offer.</p>
<p>Contact the intelligence agency immediately. investigate Warwick supply chain and find a way to impose sanctions. Mark roared. Once Huawei&#x27;s quantum phone hits the market, our market in China will suffer a devastating blow. Mark gritted his teeth and ordered, &quot;Research and development department, speed up the A29&#x27;s progress.&quot; But the CTO looked worried.</p>
<p>The A29 won&#x27;t be released until next year. We won&#x27;t make it in time. The meeting room fell silent. Panic gripped everyone. It&#x27;s over.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s really over this time. Without a chip advantage, how can we fight?&quot; Mark suddenly shouted, &quot;Fuck, stop arguing. We still have a chance. Now we&#x27;re just waiting for September 10th to see if Huawei can really go into mass production. If it&#x27;s true, we&#x27;ll contact the great SEA Kingdom and purchase quantum chips.&quot; Mark said through gritted teeth, &quot;If Huawei really launches a quantum phone, their A series chips will be completely crushed.</p>
<p>But what if Warwick is just putting up a smoke screen?&quot; In the president&#x27;s office, Secretary of State Raymond asked, &quot;Mr. President, have you seen Warwick&#x27;s announcement? Well, I still visit Great Sia as planned on September 10th. President Otto said with a sneer, &quot;You don&#x27;t really think Warwick can break through our blockade, do you?&quot; lay Ming Duo nodded silently, but he couldn&#x27;t hide his unease. It seemed that this press conference was different. Chapter 18.</p>
<p>The cell phone released. Terrifying solid state batteries for cars. News of the Huawei press conference quickly spread to the international internet. Twitter is filled with skepticism. Can Warwick really make a quantum chip phone? It&#x27;s definitely fake.</p>
<p>Probably just another scam targeting the people of Great Sea. Foreign countries generally do not believe that Huawei can manufacture quantum chip mobile phones and consider the technology of the Great Sia Kingdom to be backward. Even Yamamoto Ichiro of Donging Electronics jumped out to mock. Huawei is a fraud. Their quantum phone is definitely just a PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>He also wanted to avenge his previous humiliation at the Shanghai exhibition and even cut off trade with the Great Sia Kingdom in order to find an opportunity to humiliate it. At the same time, a senior executive from South Korea, Sonin, also made a statement, &quot;The quantum technology of the Great Sia Kingdom must have been stolen from us.&quot; Chinese nizens angrily retorted, &quot;Where&#x27;s your Korean face? Stop stirring up trouble. If Huawei didn&#x27;t have the capability, would it dare to hold a global launch event?&quot; The comment section was flooded with negative comments which were quickly suppressed. On September 10th at the Shenzhen International Convention and Exhibition Center, the venue was packed with people all eagerly awaiting the start of the press conference. Yuching Dong walked onto the stage and took out the Huawei Mate 60 Quantum Edition phone, saying, &quot;This is the world&#x27;s first phone with a 1 nanometer quantum chip, breaking the blockade imposed by the United States.&quot; He pressed the power button and the screen lit up instantly, eliciting cheers from the crowd.</p>
<p>The boot speed is simply incredible. Yuching Dong then demonstrated the phone&#x27;s charging speed, showing that it could be fully charged in 5 minutes and last for 70 days, causing the audience to erupt in cheers once again. 100 times more powerful than the new Apple phone, it can run any game with ease. The photo quality and system smoothness have reached unprecedented levels. The audience cheered.</p>
<p>This performance is amazing. Yuing Dong announced the prices. M series starting from $39.99 yuan. In series starting from 1099 yuan. Enjoy series starting from 599 yuan.</p>
<p>All series of mobile phones are equipped with one nanometer quantum chips and solidstate magnetic field batteries. The shouts at the scene once pierced the sky. Dasha is awesome. Huawei is awesome. At this moment, Huawei&#x27;s quantum chip phone completely broke through the technological blockade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Schwanu battery laboratory, academician Zhaoing looked excitedly at the test screen. 800° still working. Puncture test, no fire. As the data was continuously updated, the cheers in the laboratory grew louder and louder. Schwan Wu battery type I high temperature test, no damage at 800°.</p>
<p>Puncture test, no fire, no explosion. Range simulation. 5 minutes of charging provides 5,000 kilometers of range. Cycle life. 1 million cycles with zero decay.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s finally approved, Zhaoing exclaimed, tears streaming down his face. We no longer have to worry about foreign energy sanctions. The engineers were also thrilled and hugged each other in celebration. Looking at the data, Lynn Shun was overjoyed. Old Joe, contact the manufacturer immediately and try to get the first batch of car batteries off the production line within a month.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;ll go right now. Ming wiped away his tears and immediately went to arrange production. Lynchin quietly left the lab and returned to his office and the battery project came to a successful conclusion. He has unlocked the next technological inheritance, but has not yet determined the direction. It seems that I need to consult with Professor Lee to see which areas the country is in dire need of.</p>
<p>Chapter 19 determines weapon technology inheritance. Super laser weapon. The aftershocks of the Huawei press conference swept across the entire Blue Star world with all 10 of the top trending topics being related to Huawei. Huawei Mobile&#x27;s official website crashed. A thousand yuan quantum chip phone is really a steal.</p>
<p>This is true technological equality. The comments section was buzzing. The performance of Huawei quantum chip powered phones is absolutely phenomenal. The top-of-the-line model is only $69.99. I can&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>Even budget phones are using the latest quantum chips and solidstate batteries. The Huawei Mall app crashed. My mom asked me to buy her two P series phones so she won&#x27;t have to charge them everyday anymore. Everyone is discussing it wildly. The performance and price of quantum chip phones are astonishing.</p>
<p>Even budget phones can outperform all siliconbased flagship phones on the market. Huawei&#x27;s official website and app were overwhelmed with traffic and offline stores also required reservations. Even those rats who had previously mocked Huawei quietly went to pre-order their phones. On the international internet, foreign nizens are discussing it wildly, expressing their envy of the netizens in the great Sia Kingdom who have already begun to experience this high-tech phone. The tweet that Huawei is a PPT was deleted and the executives of Japan&#x27;s Yamamoto Ichiro and South Korea Sonin no longer mentioned the technology being stolen.</p>
<p>At the US headquarters in Apple, Mark&#x27;s face was ashen. Is it possible to buy a quantum chip? Mark asked anxiously. The technical director replied, &quot;We contacted them.&quot; And Dasa said they would prioritize supplying domestic manufacturers and would not sell to external parties for the time being. Mark roared, &quot;More money, double the price. five times the price.</p>
<p>We must get the quantum chip. He panicked, never expecting that Huawei could actually launch a mobile phone at such a low price. I want to go to the great Sea Kingdom in person to negotiate. Mark finally decided to charter a plane and fly there. Meanwhile, Lie Jian Guo was looking at the latest Schwan Wu battery report in his office, a broad smile on his face.</p>
<p>Once the Shuan Wu battery enters mass production, the new energy transformation of the Great Sea Kingdom will enter a period of rapid development. At this moment, Lynchin walked into the office and asked oldly, &quot;Is there any problem with the mass production of Schwan Wu batteries?&quot; &quot;No problem,&quot; Lie Jian Guo replied. &quot;The first batch of batteries will be off the production line within a month.&quot; Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;So, the laser weapon is also being tested with a super magnetic field battery, right?&quot; &quot;Yes, but there are significant problems.&quot; Li Jang Guoo said laser weapons can last up to 10 hours and are powerful enough to penetrate 10 cm of special armor, but their power is greatly reduced in rainy, foggy, or dusty conditions, and their range is only 50 km. Can these problems be solved? Lynchin asked. Lie Jang Wos eyes lit up.</p>
<p>You have a solution? Lynchin nodded. I&#x27;ll go back and look into it. If I find a solution, I&#x27;ll contact you as soon as possible. Okay, I&#x27;ll wait for your news. Lie Jian Guo excitedly grasped Lynch&#x27;s hand.</p>
<p>Lynchin walked out of the office, returned to his own office, hung up the do not disturb sign, and entered the inheritance space. 10 minutes later, Lynchin confirmed that the super laser weapon could solve the shortcomings of laser weapons. He chose this technology without hesitation as the new technology to be passed down. Only by overcoming the limitations of laser weapons can the defense capabilities of the great Sia Kingdom be enhanced and the security of advanced technologies be ensured. Next, Lynshin will focus on the inheritance of military technology, enhance the defense capabilities of the great Sia Kingdom, and ensure its invincibility in future technological competition.</p>
<p>Chapter 20. Roundo&#x27;s iconic scene. Lynn Shun received the technology inheritance of the superpowered laser weapon in the inheritance space. Details such as laser refraction technology, anti-inference algorithms, and atmospheric penetration schemes flooded my mind. The complete laser weapon system includes a super laser gun, a super laser cannon, and a super laser sword, and has multiple uses.</p>
<p>Lyn Shan was somewhat surprised. They even have lightsabers. This equipment appears in reality, not in science fiction, and will be used by future border guards. The power of the lightsaber made Lynchin even more eager to apply the super laser weapon technology. This will enable Dashia&#x27;s laser weapons to leap from close-range defense to long range attack with a range of thousands of kilometers penetrating the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Combined with super solid state magnetic field batteries, Dashia&#x27;s national defense will reach a new level. At the same time, domestic mobile phone manufacturers were gripped by panic. A mobile phone company in Dunwan held an emergency meeting, shocked by Huawei&#x27;s rapid mass production of quantum chip phones. How can it be so fast? The quantum chip has been in mass production for less than a month. The boss lamented, &quot;If only I had gone all out back then, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this predicament today.&quot; Huawei&#x27;s budget phones priced at 100 or a,000 yuan are equipped with quantum chips, making it impossible for our high-end phones to compete.</p>
<p>The marketing director stated, &quot;If Warwick returns to the international market, it will be very difficult for us to regain market share.&quot; The boss in a moment of desperation decided I&#x27;ll go to the SEA Academy of Sciences myself. We can&#x27;t wait any longer. The other executives understood that the company was facing a life or death test. Domestic mobile phone manufacturers have contacted Shaman Science and Technology Institute in an attempt to catch up with Huawei. Their RD capabilities are significantly inferior to those of Huawei and their adaptation cycle is far behind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Raymond&#x27;s private plane landed at the capital airport. She had just gotten off the plane when a CCTV reporter asked her for her opinion on the release of the Huawei Quantum Chip phone. Laying Duo paused for a moment, inwardly cursing the reporter for not knowing the timing, and forced a smile, saying, &quot;Hu cannot achieve mass production because they cannot bypass our technological blockade.&quot; She was clearly unaware that Warwick&#x27;s press conference had already been successfully held. The reporter looked puzzled, finding it hard to understand why Lay Ming Duo dared to make such outrageous remarks. Chapter 21 sanctions.</p>
<p>Wait for the counter sanctions. Inside the live stream, the chat was flooded with comments with netzens mocking laying duo. Hilarious. Huawei phones have already started pre-orders and she&#x27;s still blocking them. The phone will be delivered in 10 days and she still wants to sanction the air.</p>
<p>Is Rayondo joking? Does the US have quantum chip technology? Raymond felt a sense of forboding but forced himself to remain calm. Our technological position is unshakable and Warwick cannot bypass our blockade. The reporter reminded her, &quot;Madam secretary, Warwick&#x27;s quantum chip phone has been released and it&#x27;s affordable.&quot; laying duo was stunned. This how is this possible? The diplomat from Great Sa Kingdom standing next to him smiled and said, &quot;Times are progressing and great sea technology companies are no longer objects to be bullied.&quot; Romano&#x27;s smile vanished instantly, replaced by anger and shame. She originally intended to show off her power, but instead encountered a counterattack.</p>
<p>Even if Huawei releases a quantum chip phone, it&#x27;s still uncertain who will win in the future. The reporter pressed further. How will the US sanction Warwick next? Lay Manguo was speechless. We will study it. In short, we will not let Huawei succeed so easily.</p>
<p>She quickly ended the interview and left the airport. Netzens continued to mock him. Seeing laying duo in such a sorry state is so satisfying. Huawei&#x27;s quantum chip is unique in the world. Does the US want to impose sanctions? The video spread rapidly and Rayondo became Warwick&#x27;s international spokesperson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the White House, Ottoman was furious after seeing Raunders&#x27;s disgraceful behavior. Is this old woman stupid? An adviser suggested. Even if Huawei mass-produces quantum chip phones, will they be able to sell them in the international market? OTP, calm down. As long as we blockade the Warwick international market, they will have no choice but to stay in Great Sia. The US has imposed sanctions on China&#x27;s quantum chips, prohibiting their purchase under threat of a blockade by the alliance.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I suggest we focus our efforts on developing quantum chips. OTEP ordered joint research and development and strictly block Warwick&#x27;s international market. They plan to intensify sanctions to ensure that Huawei mobile phones cannot leave the country. At the same time, after receiving the laser weapon technology training at the Seyaku Academy, Lynshin went to find Lie Jian Guo as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo was extremely excited. Shaolin, are you telling the truth? Lynchin confidently replied, &quot;I am fully confident in solving the problem of laser weapons.&quot; Lie Jian Guo was stunned and asked urgently, &quot;Quickly, tell me, how do we solve these problems?&quot; Lynchin slowly explained the plan and Li Jang Guoo became more and more shocked as he listened. Let&#x27;s go, Kobayashi. Let&#x27;s go to the lab now. Chapter 22.</p>
<p>Crossing domains. Chief Engineer Lynn, are you defying the heavens? At the laser weapon laboratory of the Seyaku Academy, a group of experts and engineers are studying the latest test data. Their expressions grave. We still can&#x27;t break through in rainy and foggy weather. The battery life issue has been resolved, but it still only allows for close-range defense.</p>
<p>At this moment, Lie Jian Guo led Lin Chun into the laboratory and excitedly said, &quot;Look everyone, Chief Engineer Lynn is here.&quot; The people in the lab were all surprised. Chief Engineer Lynn, what&#x27;s he doing here? Lie Jian Guo explained with a smile. Chief designer Lynn came to solve the problem of laser weapons. What? Academician Lu asked doubtfully. Laser weapons are completely different from quantum chips.</p>
<p>Is it even possible? Li Jang Wo gestured for Lynshin to explain. Lynchin walked to the test screen and pointed to the data. You think that water vapor blocked the laser, but you&#x27;re wrong. He explained that the problem was that the energy frequency did not match the atmospheric refractive index. The water droplets were simply refracting the laser, not blocking it.</p>
<p>Academician Luke couldn&#x27;t believe it. We&#x27;ve already calculated the refractive index. How could it be wrong? Lynshin smiled and continued explaining, writing down the formula to explain the change in refractive index caused by temperature changes. If we take temperature changes into account, this variable can overcome the obstacle of rainy and foggy weather. The laboratory fell silent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, academician Lu excitedly slapped his thigh. That&#x27;s it. How come I didn&#x27;t think of that? The other engineers also suddenly realized what had happened and apologized to Linshan, saying, &quot;We misunderstood you.&quot; Lynshin smiled and waved his hand. No need to be so polite. I only know a little about it myself.</p>
<p>The experts were embarrassed, but even more so, they felt admiration. Academician Lu then asked, &quot;So, how do we solve the problem of lasers penetrating the atmosphere?&quot; Lynshin explained, &quot;As long as a refracting prism is designed and combined with a solid magnetic field battery, energy loss can be reduced to 1%.&quot; The lab erupted in cheers. This prism design is amazing. I really admire the ingenuity of young people. They can solve such a big problem with such simple changes.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Lie Jiano immediately announced, &quot;Chief designer Lynn will serve as the chief technical adviser to help develop new laser weapons. The experts unanimously agreed. Full of anticipation, Lynn Shen devoted himself to the research and development of laser weapons. If successful, the weaponry of Earth will usher in a completely new competitive landscape.&quot; Chapter 23. A fool gives away money, scamming Apple company of 50 billion.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo frowned slightly when he saw a list of people applying for help in the Siaki Yuan office. Pingua and Sanhin are also here to buy chips. Li Jian Guo chuckled dismissively. Didn&#x27;t they look down on us before? Now they&#x27;re begging to come to us. He was filled with resentment as he recalled the two company&#x27;s past contemptuous attitude towards Dasha Technology.</p>
<p>Businessmen are indeed profit-driven. They don&#x27;t even care about the sanctions imposed by the United States. Forget it. I&#x27;ll go ask Lynch instead. Lie Jian Guo decided to seek Lin Chin&#x27;s opinion.</p>
<p>Lyn Shan was working on a laser weapon technology plan in his office when he saw Li Jian Guo enter and stopped what he was doing. Oldly did you come to see me for something? Lynchan asked. Lie Jian Guo explained the situation. Lynchin sneered. Pingua and Sanin want to use our quantum chips.</p>
<p>The price is 100 times that of domestic ones. Moreover, if we wait until there is a surplus in domestic demand before supplying goods, it will be useless for them to buy them. Lie Jian Guoo laughed loudly. That&#x27;s a ruthless move. They&#x27;ll definitely start cursing.</p>
<p>What about the domestic companies? Li Jang Guoo asked. Lynchin responded indifferently. Let them adapt slowly. I don&#x27;t have time to deal with them. Lie Jian Guo nodded.</p>
<p>Their purpose in applying now is too obvious. Huawei has successfully developed the technology and lowered the price. So the market will not be monopolized by them alone. After understanding, Li Jang Guoo decided to go back and handle it. Since you are busy, I will have my subordinates reply to them.</p>
<p>After Lie Jiano left, Lin Chun continued to work. On the other side, after receiving Siaki Yuans reply, general manager Lelay of the Rice Company was so angry that his face turned ashen. Why can Huawei get help, but our rice company can&#x27;t? I absolutely cannot give up. I must put pressure on the leaders in Beijing. President Lelay decided to seek more support.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sanchin s executives flew directly back to South Korea. At a five-star hotel in Beijing, Marco of Pingua Company was furious after receiving a reply from the Academy of Sciences. 800 times the price. Why don&#x27;t you just rob us? He cursed. And you have to pay in full upfront before you can even wait for the goods.</p>
<p>He suppressed his anger and convened an online shareholders meeting. After the meeting, the shareholders unanimously agreed. Even if it&#x27;s 100 times, we can pass it on to consumers and improve phone performance. With 90% of shareholders in favor, the vote passed. I will earn it back from the great SEA Kingdom 100fold, a thousandfold.</p>
<p>Marco&#x27;s eyes blazed with the flames of revenge. He quickly replied to the Academy of Sciences, agreeing to the stringent conditions and placing an order for 5 million chips in one go. Li Jian Guo was stunned when he received the news. Has Pengua Company gone mad? 5 million ships, 10,000 yuan each. He informed Lynch of the matter and awaited instructions.</p>
<p>Lynchan quickly replied, &quot;It&#x27;s like a fool is giving away money. Why not take it? The specific delivery time is yet to be determined.&quot; Lie Jian Guo excitedly replied, &quot;50 billion. That&#x27;s enough for research funding.&quot; After the contract was signed, Marco made the payment and excitedly returned to the United States. Chapter 24 laser weapon test. Target Starlink satellite.</p>
<p>On September 20th, Huawei&#x27;s quantum chip powered mobile phone officially went on sale. At a physical store in Shenzhen, customers lined up for three blocks, including scalpers. Online sales were even more frenzied with the Huawei app crashing multiple times and 2 million phones selling out in 0.1 seconds. 2 million units sold out in less than a second. The comments section exploded.</p>
<p>Huawei&#x27;s first day sales broke all records. At 10:30 a.m., the first batch of owners began to show off their test results. In a university dormatory, Wong Lelay turned on the computer to test it, and the screen lit up in 1 second. Playing Ginchin Impact on high settings with a stable frame rate of 120 fps, the battery only dropped by 1% after 2 hours. The video immediately went viral online with netizens commenting for a phone priced around 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This is incredibly powerful. Huawei has really pulled it off this time. Even budget phones can play demanding games. Huawei&#x27;s quantum chip has completely shocked the market. Upon seeing Huawei&#x27;s initial sales figures, Mark sneered.</p>
<p>Once we launch our quantum chip phone, Huawei will still be trampled under our feet. Meanwhile, at the laser weapon testing site of the Seyaku Academy, academician Lu stared at the screen, his hands trembling slightly. Super laser cannon, prepare for testing. Target: Aerial drone target 100 km away. Lynshin stood in front of the control panel and commanded.</p>
<p>Set the energy to 50% fire. The superpowered laser cannon charged. A blue arc of electricity flashed and a blinding light tore through the sky. The drone target 100 km away instantly vaporized and disappeared without a trace. The crowd erupted in cheers.</p>
<p>We did it. We&#x27;ve overcome the obstacle of rainy and foggy weather. Lynshin&#x27;s proposal completely changed their laser weapon design and the test results far exceeded expectations. Academician Lu excitedly stated, &quot;50% of the energy is enough to destroy the target with only 0.1% loss. This is beyond the acceptable limit.&quot; Lynchin smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>However, this is just a ground test. Next, we will conduct near-Earth space tests. What? Near-earth space testing? Academician Lou was taken aback. Lynshin smiled and said, &quot;Target. A decommissioned satellite in low Earth orbit.&quot; He pointed to the satellite image found an abandoned satellite and locked onto the USS Starlink satellite as a target.</p>
<p>Power up to 100%. Target abandoned satellite. Chapter 25 100% power instant destruction. Upon hearing this, academician Louu looked at the near-Earth orbit satellite image. When he saw that in the straight orbit of that abandoned satellite, there were still several Starlink satellites belonging to the United States.</p>
<p>He instantly guessed Lin Shin&#x27;s target. His eyes widened in shock. Chief Engineer Lynn, isn&#x27;t this a bit risky? What if it affects America&#x27;s satellites? Lynn Shin smiled calmly. Academician Lu, don&#x27;t worry. It definitely won&#x27;t affect other satellites.</p>
<p>Only he knew how terrifying a superpowered laser cannon at 100% power would be. The abandoned satellite was just a side effect. His ultimate goal is the USS Starling satellites. Chief engineer Lynn, are you sure this won&#x27;t affect other satellites? Confirmed. Lynn Shin explained with a smile.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you trust the accuracy of our laser weapons? It&#x27;s precise, but academician Lu didn&#x27;t continue, but he still had some doubts. I have a feeling that Lin Shan is up to something bad, but he had no evidence. If the abandoned satellite is simply used as a test target, then the test can be conducted directly. However, if it affects American satellites, it needs to be reported before testing can proceed. Otherwise, it could easily trigger an international dispute.</p>
<p>This would put the Great Sa Kingdom in a passive position. Moreover, there have always been international conventions. Attack satellites or space stations in near Earth space during peace time. Otherwise, it will face sanctions and condemnation from all countries. Although there is a convention, but over the years, the US has launched countless satellites into near-Earth space.</p>
<p>After their lifespan expires, they all become space debris. Furthermore, the US often secretly uses near dead satellites to collide with the normal satellites of China and Russia. They even attempted to crash into the space station of the Great Sea Kingdom. This isn&#x27;t the first time the US has done something like this. However, none of this has been made public.</p>
<p>Now, Lynn Shun intends to use this method to collect interest from the United States. Prepare to continue testing. Target, a defunct satellite in near Earth space. Power set to 100%. Start charging.</p>
<p>2 seconds later, charging complete. Lynch waved his hand and shouted, &quot;Fire!&quot; A dazzling laser beam suddenly shot out from the transmitter like a sharp blade slicing through the darkness of near-ear space. It hurdled straight toward the abandoned satellite. Wherever the laser passed, the air seemed to ignite, radiating a scorching heat. The atmosphere was penetrated instantly.</p>
<p>At the testing site, everyone was intently watching the monitor screen. Sudden, the moment the laser hit, the surface of the abandoned satellite lit up with a blinding light. Immediately afterwards, the satellite disappeared. Although sound cannot travel in a vacuum, but the intense light from the explosion and the immediate disappearance of the satellite both demonstrate the terrifying power of superpowered lasers. Just when everyone thought it was a perfect ending, they discovered that the laser beam in the footage did not disappear after destroying the abandoned satellite.</p>
<p>Starlink satellites in different orbits on the same straight line. Upon seeing this, academician Louu immediately sensed something was wrong. This is bad. But it was too late to stop it. In the blink of an eye, after three flashes of light, the three Starlink satellites of the United States were vaporized and disappeared into space.</p>
<p>The silent space has returned to its former tranquility. It&#x27;s as if it never existed. This is it&#x27;s all over. This is a huge problem. The three Starlink satellites belonging to the United States.</p>
<p>Academician Lou felt that he had made a mistake. The other engineers were all so shocked that their mouths were slightly a gabe, and they looked completely dumbfounded. They all spend long periods of time in the lab conducting research. Where have I ever seen such a grand scene, a direct attack on US satellites? This was something they had just thought of during their simulations. Now that it&#x27;s actually happening right before their eyes, how could they not be shocked? A moment later, the engineers came to their senses.</p>
<p>We We destroyed the US satellite. Someone hit me. I feel like I&#x27;m dreaming. Really? We really destroyed three US satellites. Haha, that was so exciting.</p>
<p>Awesome. The engineers eyes were filled with excitement. They destroyed three of America&#x27;s satellites in one go. With this achievement, they&#x27;ll have more confidence to brag to their colleagues in the future. Things I never dared to do before.</p>
<p>It has now been achieved unintentionally. Academician Lou was exasperated by the engineers excitement. You&#x27;re still getting excited about this. This could trigger an international dispute. The United States will definitely not let this go.</p>
<p>When the higher-ups investigate, just say, &quot;I ordered the test. understand. Academician Lu is prepared to take all the responsibility. Lynchin definitely cannot be implicated. The other engineers are young and have bright futures ahead of them.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s an old man, so it&#x27;s not a big deal for him to take on some responsibility. Seeing Academician Lu&#x27;s resolute and heroic appearance, Lynshin felt a warmth in his heart and patiently explained, &quot;Old Lou, you&#x27;ve worried too much. So, what if they find out? Who can prove that we destroyed the US satellite? Would they dare retaliate? If they dare to retaliate, I&#x27;ll show them what cruelty is. In the end, Lynchin&#x27;s tone was full of doineering confidence. Super laser weapons have been successfully developed.</p>
<p>Moreover, all mass production process parameters have been perfected. Now, all that&#x27;s needed is for it to pass the military&#x27;s inspection. This allows for large-scale production and deployment. In case of an emergency, many of these steps can be skipped and we can go directly to the mass production stage. By then, the airspace of the great Sia Kingdom will be a forbidden zone.</p>
<p>Even a bird that comes in can be shot down at any time without permission. But this violates international conventions after all, academician Lu said, still somewhat uneasy. Lynshin smiled and said doineeringly. Covenants are made for the weak. The strong always make the covenants.</p>
<p>The strong make the pact. Academician Lu paused for a moment. Then his eyes gradually hardened. Yes. In the past, the Great Sa Kingdom was relatively backward and everything had to be considered from multiple perspectives and in the long term.</p>
<p>But things are different now. The Great Sa Kingdom already possesses sufficient strength to support it. No more being as timid and hesitant as before. Now is the time to strike hard. Chief Engineer Lynn, you&#x27;re right.</p>
<p>The strong are the ones who make the packs, and our great Sa Kingdom will also become that strong one. Academician Lu&#x27;s gaze was intense at that moment. His thoughts were elevated. The engineers around them were the same. After carefully considering Lin Chen&#x27;s words, his eyes shone with an unprecedented light.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a sense of pride in a strong nation and aspirations for the infinite possibilities of future scientific research. From this moment on, they have become hawkish researchers. Lynch felt very gratified to see their change of mindset. He knew that a country&#x27;s strength was not only reflected in its technology and economy. This is further reflected in the people&#x27;s self-confidence and national pride.</p>
<p>Today, the shift in the thinking of these researchers is an important sign of the nation&#x27;s path to prosperity. Everyone continue with the other tests. Strive to achieve mass production and deployment as soon as possible. Lynchin gave a few instructions and then left the testing site first. At the same time, the Eagle far across the Pacific Ocean panic gripped NASA&#x27;s satellite monitoring center.</p>
<p>Chapter 26. Eagle. Where are my satellites? On the monitor screen. David, a staff member at the monitoring center, was leisurely drinking coffee, wearing headphones, and humming a tune. He glanced at the monitor screen out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>Starlink satellite icons, which were originally arranged in an orderly manner, suddenly disappeared for three moments. Am I seeing things? David quickly put down his coffee and rushed closer to the screen. He rapidly tapped his hands on the control panel, bringing up detailed status data for the satellite. Then David exclaimed in surprise, &quot;Oh my god, what on earth happened? Three satellites lost contact simultaneously.&quot; The exclamation caught the attention of another staff member. David, what did you say? Three of our satellites have disappeared.</p>
<p>David&#x27;s hand trembled as he pointed to the data on the monitor screen, his voice filled with disbelief. See for yourselves. The staff member quickly looked at the data on the monitor screen. Three Starling satellites has indeed disappeared. They didn&#x27;t just lose contact.</p>
<p>They simply vanished. Something terrible has happened. Get the supervisor right now. The staff member could tell at a glance that something was wrong. I ran straight out and reported to their supervisor.</p>
<p>David, on the other hand, looked flustered and at a loss. He was just an intern who got the job through connections. I&#x27;ve only been working for a week and this has already happened. He was completely at a loss. Oh no.</p>
<p>I hope they won&#x27;t make me take the blame. I just graduated. I don&#x27;t want to spend the rest of my life in prison. David felt a pang of despair. They even considered running away.</p>
<p>Just as David was in a panic, the staff member hurriedly led a middle-aged white man into the monitoring room. The middle-aged white man was Hans, the director of the monitoring center. He had barely entered the room when he confronted them with a grim expression. David, what&#x27;s going on? Why did the satellite disappear? David&#x27;s face was contorted with grief. his voice trembling.</p>
<p>I I don&#x27;t know either. He was fine one second and then the next second he just disappeared. Supervisor Hans&#x27;s face instantly turned even uglier and he roared, &quot;Idiot. You don&#x27;t know the reason? Why aren&#x27;t you investigating? If they can&#x27;t find the cause, then you&#x27;ll be facing a military court.&quot; Upon hearing that he would be court marshaled, David trembled with fear. &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll investigate right away.&quot; But his hands wouldn&#x27;t obey him at all.</p>
<p>He couldn&#x27;t even operate the mouse. Seeing this, Hans kicked him aside, yelling, &quot;Fuck, get out of here.&quot; Then he did it himself. He quickly pulled up the last images from the three satellites. After repeatedly slowing down the playback, Hans finally discovered some clues. Before the three satellites disappeared, a terrifying white light flashed by.</p>
<p>This is He quickly froze the image and then zoomed in to view it frame by frame. When he saw the scene clearly, he was shocked. How is that possible? No, this must be fake. The scene he saw was Lin Shun testing the superpowered laser cannon to destroy the abandoned satellite. What was that light? How could a defunct satellite be destroyed with their three satellites? Could it be that their three satellites were also destroyed by that beam of light? Could it be a laser weapon? Upon realizing this, Hans&#x27;s expression changed drastically.</p>
<p>If laser weapons destroy their satellites, then things will be very serious. He was no longer capable of handling this matter. This must be reported. Without turning his head, Hans reported this strange incident to NASA headquarters. Not long after, NASA then convened technical experts to analyze the relevant reasons.</p>
<p>Blade fired from a laser weapon. A bespectled gay-haired technical expert reviewed the relevant data and immediately drew a conclusion. Are you sure? NASA administrator Trudeau frowned. Yes, the expert nodded emphatically. Director, according to the relevant data, it is indeed the result of a laser weapon.</p>
<p>Other experts also expressed their agreement. A laser weapon dured where does it come from? How does it overcome atmospheric attenuation? This all the experts were speechless. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it. Currently, no country on earth has been able to overcome the drawbacks of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere decay in terms of laser weapon technology. But how is that done in space? If other satellites were nearby, their Starlink satellites would have detected them long ago.</p>
<p>All the experts couldn&#x27;t figure it out. The atmosphere in the meeting room suddenly froze. At this moment, an expert suddenly spoke up. &quot;Director, perhaps we should investigate the exact location where our satellite disappeared. Check which country&#x27;s airspace that position corresponds to.&quot; Upon hearing this, Trudeau&#x27;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Right. Quickly check and see which country&#x27;s airspace it disappeared over. Soon, the results are in. When the experts saw the final results, their faces instantly darkened. Chief.</p>
<p>Yes. It disappeared over the airspace of the Great Sia Kingdom. The Great Sia Kingdom. Dur&#x27;s expression changed drastically upon hearing this. Impossible.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t the military say that the laser weapon technology of the Great Sa Kingdom is the same as ours? Could it be that they&#x27;ve broken through? A terrible possibility occurred to Durit and a strong sense of unease welled up inside him. If the great SA kingdom truly makes a major breakthrough in laser weapons, the consequences would be unimaginable. Near Earth space may no longer be safe, three satellites may disappear today. What about tomorrow or the day after? Is it possible that the Great Sa Kingdom could shoot down their satellites at any time? Chief, I suggest we report this to the military for handling. Yes.</p>
<p>Trudeau nodded. I&#x27;ll report it right away. After saying that, he hurriedly left the meeting room. The remaining experts did not leave. Instead, we continued the analysis.</p>
<p>The news quickly reached the White House Oval Office. Upon hearing the news, President Aep&#x27;s expression instantly turned extremely grave. He stared wideeyed at General MacArthur, a five-star military officer. &quot;Are you sure the Great Sa Kingdom has made a breakthrough in laser weaponry, and they destroyed three of our satellites?&quot; Five-star General MacArthur said in a deep voice, &quot;It&#x27;s not finalized, but the probability is very high, although there is no direct evidence.&quot; However, analysis of the disappearance of the three satellites shows. It was destroyed by the laser weapons of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Its power far exceeded their expectations. It is more powerful than any laser weapon they have currently developed. &quot;Fuck,&quot; Otep cursed angrily. Why is it the great Sia kingdom again? In less than two months, they not only broke through our semiconductor sanctions now even laser weapons have achieved major breakthroughs. What exactly happened in the great SIA kingdom? Didn&#x27;t the CIA have any information at all? Finally, OTP glared angrily at CIA Director Trife.</p>
<p>Trife felt the president&#x27;s piercing gaze. Fine beads of sweat appeared on his forehead and he answered with a forced smile. Mr. President, our CIA has been closely monitoring the situation in the great Sia Kingdom. But their breakthrough this time was too sudden.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t receive any prior intelligence. It&#x27;s as if these technologies all broke through suddenly without any warning. President Otto&#x27;s brow furrowed, his anger still simmering. Suddenly? How could it be sudden? There must be a flaw in your work. UCIA receive huge sums of money every year, yet you can&#x27;t even gather this much intelligence.</p>
<p>Triff quickly explained, &quot;Mr. President, the Great Sa Kingdom has done an extremely thorough job of maintaining secrecy this time.&quot; OTP interrupted directly. &quot;All right, I&#x27;ll give you 3 days. You must find out whether the Great Sa Kingdom has truly achieved a major breakthrough in the field of laser weapons. If you can&#x27;t find out in 3 days, you should just resign.</p>
<p>Also, until the situation is fully investigated, the news of the satellites destruction should be temporarily suppressed.&quot; Yes, Mr. President MacArthur and Trevor exchanged a glance, then hurriedly left. Chapter 27. The CIA is in action. The Great Sea military is shocked.</p>
<p>The US CIA headquarters. Tribes smashed the office to pieces. Documents were scattered all over the floor and coffee cups were shattered into pieces. His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the map of the great Sia Kingdom on the wall. 3 days.</p>
<p>Only 3 days. If they can&#x27;t find out, I&#x27;m fired. The deputy stood at the door, barely daring to breathe. Triff suddenly turned around, his eyes filled with madness. Activate hibernator.</p>
<p>The deputy looked up abruptly, his face turning pale. Chief, you mustn&#x27;t. The hibernators have been hidden for 20 years, only to be activated in the event of a major crisis. If we activate it now and the great Sia kingdom discovers it, all our informants will be exposed. Expose? Trif sneered, his teeth grinding.</p>
<p>Is it more important to expose our informant or to find out about the great SA&#x27;s laser weapon? If they can shoot down three Starling satellites, they can shoot down many more of ours. Who will bear the losses then? And the president only gave us 3 days. If we can&#x27;t find the answer in 3 days, everyone&#x27;s fired. This the deputy wanted to offer some advice, but didn&#x27;t know how to begin. They couldn&#x27;t even keep their buttocks.</p>
<p>Why worry about revealing our hidden cards? Tri picked up a black phone and dialed a special number. Send a telegram to old ghost at all costs to investigate the recent testing projects of the SEA Academy of Sciences, even if it means destroying the entire intelligence network. We must get the data. Also, send our Global Hawk drones to monitor that location in the Great Sa Kingdom. There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, followed by a cold yes.</p>
<p>Tribe hung up the phone and slumped into his chair. He stared at the ceiling, his eyes filled with ruthlessness. Great Sia Kingdom. Let&#x27;s see how you hide this time. At the same time, the military satellite monitoring center in the capital of the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>They also discovered the disappearance of US satellites. After the report was submitted, an officer is investigating. Wait, rewind the footage. Staff officer Wong&#x27;s voice trembled slightly as he stared intently at the screen. Okay.</p>
<p>The technician was a little nervous, but his movements were very nimble. Sudden a white light flashed across the screen. The US&#x27;s three Starlink satellites disappeared instantly. This is Staff Officer Wong was instantly shocked. A laser weapon.</p>
<p>He looked at it several more times. It was ultimately confirmed that it was indeed a laser weapon. Investigate. Investigate the source of this beam of light immediately. Staff Officer Wong&#x27;s voice trembled with excitement.</p>
<p>Receive. 10 minutes later. The technician holding the investigation results excitedly said, &quot;Found it.&quot; The beam came from the Seyaku Institute&#x27;s testing base. Sia Academy of Sciences. Staff Officer Wong suddenly stood up straight, his eyes filled with excitement.</p>
<p>When did they develop such advanced laser weapons? They didn&#x27;t even notify the military. After the initial shock, Staff Officer Wong immediately picked up the red phone and dialed the number. General, this is fantastic news. Siaki Yuan tested a new laser weapon that penetrated the atmosphere and shot down three US satellites. After a two-cond silence on the other end of the walkie-talkie, a hurried and excited command came through.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m coming over right now. Wait for me at the Syaku Academy. Yes, General. Staff officer Wong hung up the phone excitedly, then hurriedly led the technical soldiers to the Xiaku Academy. Siaki Yuan Li Jang Wos office.</p>
<p>Lynchin had just taken a sip of tea. Li Jang Wo sat down next to Lyn Shun and asked excitedly, &quot;Kobayashi, tell me the truth. Did you do those three Starlink satellites on purpose?&quot; Lynchin put down his teacup and nodded with a smile. It definitely wasn&#x27;t intentional. They were just unlucky to happen to be in the path of the laser attack.</p>
<p>Bad luck. Li Jian Guo was speechless, rolling his eyes at Lynch. Are you trying to say that their satellites collided with your laser cannon by themselves? He he really knows me. Lynchan chuckled. He rarely shows this relaxed side.</p>
<p>She only acts like this in front of Li Jian Guo. Li Jian Guo was speechless, truly exasperated with Linshan. You You have no idea how serious the consequences of this will be. But as soon as he finished speaking, Li Jian Guo suddenly became excited again. Well done.</p>
<p>The Americans used to always crash our satellites, but now they&#x27;ve finally gotten their revenge. As a high-ranking official at the Seyaku Academy, Liian Guo must know things that others don&#x27;t. For example, the satellites of the Great Sea Kingdom would occasionally lose contact for no apparent reason. It was destroyed by the US using a nearly obsolete satellite. This time, Lynch&#x27;s actions can be seen as venting the long suppressed anger of the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos appreciation for Lynch grew stronger. Not only are their research capabilities strong, even when faced with a problem, he remains so decisive and unafraid. In the future, they will surely shoulder the heavy responsibility of scientific research in Dasha. Lie Jian Guo patted Lin Chun on the shoulder, his eyes full of approval. However, oldly, don&#x27;t worry.</p>
<p>That kind of thing will never happen again. Once this laser weapon goes into mass production, not even a fly will be able to enter the airspace of our great Sia Kingdom. Lynn Shin&#x27;s gaze was firm, and his tone was full of confidence. Didn&#x27;t the US send its warplanes to probe the edge of China&#x27;s airspace before? Even in the early 2000s, a pilot from the Great Sea Kingdom was tragically killed. This grudge must be avenged.</p>
<p>If the US war plananes dare to come and swagger around again, it will definitely be shot down. Kobayashi, I believe you can do it. Lie Jian Guo patted Lin Shen&#x27;s shoulder forcefully, his eyes full of trust and expectation. Just then, there was a knock on the office door. Li Jian Guo stood up and said, &quot;Come in.&quot; A group of people in military uniforms walked in.</p>
<p>The leader, dressed in a crisp general&#x27;s uniform with three gleaming gold stars on his shoulders, was none other than General Jeang from the military. Lie Jang Guo quickly stepped forward. Generalhang, what brings you here? General Zang asked expectantly. Dean Lee, did you test fire a laser weapon today? Lie Jang Wo nodded. Yes, it really is you.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s great. General Jeang exclaimed excitedly. You were the ones who destroyed those three US satellites. Yes, excellent. General Jeang clapped his hands and exclaimed, &quot;Who came up with this idea?&quot; At this moment, General Jeang was too excited to notice Linch&#x27;s presence.</p>
<p>Even if he noticed, he would still think that Lyn Shun was just Li Jang Wos assistant. After all, Lynch is too young. Lie Jian Guo remained silent for two seconds. He told the truth. It was Chief Engineer Lynn who set the test target.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn. General Jeang asked in confusion, &quot;Where is he? Can you take me to see him?&quot; Lie Jian Guo turned to Lin Shun and introduced him. General Jang, this is Chief Designer Lynn. He was in charge of developing the new laser weapon. Your chief engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>General exclaimed in surprise, &quot;You&#x27;re so young. It&#x27;s me.&quot; Lynn Shun greeted with a smile, neither humble nor arrogant. Generalhang, greetings. So young and already a chief engineer. Truly heroes emerge from among the young.</p>
<p>Haha. Only you young people would do something like using a laser weapon to shoot down an American satellite. After his initial surprise, General Jeang was filled with admiration. He had no doubt about Lin Chins identity. He was able to appear in Li Jang Wos office because Lie Jian Guo personally introduced him.</p>
<p>It can&#x27;t be fake. Next, Linshin began to give a brief introduction to the performance of the super laser cannon. The more General Jeang listened, the heavier his breathing became. Good, good, good. Finally, General Jeang said, &quot;Good three times.</p>
<p>You could even see that his eyes were red.&quot; &quot;Chief designer Len, is this laser weapon capable of mass production?&quot; General Xang looked at Lyn Shan with hope. &quot;Okay,&quot; Lynchan nodded emphatically. He could feel General&#x27;s fervor and anticipation. &quot;They also understand the importance of this laser weapon for national security.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; General Jeang exclaimed in surprise, then slapped his thigh excitedly. &quot;That&#x27;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Once mass production begins, our great Xia Kingdoms airspace will be safe. It can even be mounted on warships and used as a powerful weapon.&quot; As he spoke, General Jeang thought of the battery life issue and suddenly sighed. &quot;It&#x27;s a pity that it can&#x27;t be equipped by the army, otherwise it would be perfect.&quot; &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, don&#x27;t you agree?&quot; Lynn Shin shook his head. General Jeang. The new laser weapon has solved the endurance problem and can be deployed across the entire army.</p>
<p>What? General was taken aback, then stared intently at Lynch. You mean the battery life issue is resolved? General Jeang suddenly turned his head and stared at Lynch. Chief Engineer Lynn, could you let us witness a test? Lynch nodded and directly stated a set of data. Upon hearing this, General Xang became as excited as a child once again. Very good.</p>
<p>Now our army can also deploy mobile laser cannons. After the initial excitement subsided, General Jeang asked expectantly, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, can we go and see the actual test ourselves?&quot; Lynchin nodded. Of course, our engineers are at the test site right now. All right, let&#x27;s go take a look now. General is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the new laser cannon.</p>
<p>Soon, a group of people rush to the laser cannon test site. At this moment, the laser cannon is being tested to penetrate the steel plate with a horizontal shot. Fire. Chapter 28. Destroy the US Global Hawk drones.</p>
<p>Laser testing field. Lin Shun and General Jeang had just arrived at the entrance. Then a loud shout was heard. Fire. The words fell.</p>
<p>A blinding white light shot out from the muzzle of the cannon. Like a white lightning bolt, it hurdled straight to the center of the firing range. There were 10 layers of steel plates piled up there. Each layer is 10 cm thick and is made of military grade special steel. The test has started.</p>
<p>General instantly turned his gaze in that direction, his eyes filled with anticipation. Lie Jian Guo and the others also looked over there excitedly. Only Lynn Chin remained calm because he already knew the outcome. In the inheritance space, he had no idea how many times he had tested it. It is precisely because of the countless tests that there is room for inheritance.</p>
<p>Only then could the super laser cannon be optimized to such terrifying power. At the same time, it also allows the great Sia kingdom to quickly mass-produce. The direction everyone is watching. The next second, a blinding white light struck the steel plate. There was no explosion, no sparks.</p>
<p>The steel plate looked like ice that had been dowsted with boiling water. It penetrates instantly starting from the first layer, second layer, third layer up to the 10th floor. The entire pile of steel plates was directly gasified. All that remained was a dark, deep crater. Not even a trace of steel slag remained.</p>
<p>The scene was silent for 0.5 seconds. Piss. Everyone gasped in shock. This power is terrifying. It could probably even penetrate the armor of an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>If it were installed on a warship, there&#x27;s no need for aircraft carriers at all. Ordinary warships are invincible. US carrier strike group. That&#x27;s a joke. General Jeang suddenly slapped his thigh.</p>
<p>Smack. Great. What a brilliant laser cannon. This power is terrifying. The three gold stars on his shoulders were dazzling.</p>
<p>The usually composed general was now like a child who had just seen candy. He turned to look at Lin Shan, asking expectantly, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, can laser weapons be mass-produced now?&quot; Lyn Shin stood to the side, his white shirt fluttering in the wind. His face remained expressionless. He simply nodded and said, &quot;Yes. If there is a laser weapon production workshop, it can be easily modified.</p>
<p>And the special batteries for laser weapons also need to be manufactured by your military. If all goes well, mass production can begin in 2 weeks at most. The special battery that Lynch mentioned, it is the ultimate version of the super solid state magnetic field battery. It&#x27;s completely different from those crippled mobile phone and car batteries. Half a month, General Ciangs eyes widened instantly, his face filled with unbelievable surprise.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s incredibly fast. You don&#x27;t need to worry about the production workshop. When I get back, I&#x27;ll contact the general armament&#x27;s logistics department and have them resolve this. He originally thought he would have to wait at least 3 months. Unexpectedly, it only took half a month.</p>
<p>As for the issue of the production plant, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing to worry about. The General Armament&#x27;s logistics department can resolve this at any time. Currently, many military factories have few or no orders. just release a little bit of information. Orders are being snapped up,&quot; Lin Shin nodded confidently.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the manufacturer is fine, my technology is perfectly adequate.&quot; General Zang said excitedly, &quot;Great. After I finish watching the test, I&#x27;ll arrange for someone to talk to you as soon as I get back.&quot; Lie Jian Guo watched quietly from the side. Lynshin did not feel resentful because General Jeang valued him. On the contrary, he hoped that Lynchin could appear in front of these important figures more often. This will be of greater help to Lin Chin&#x27;s future prospects.</p>
<p>Then Lynn Shun and General Jeang continued to watch the test. Almost every test left General and his entourage speechless with astonishment. Even in the end, they became completely numb because the performance of this super laser cannon is simply terrifying. It completely overturned their understanding of laser cannons. Chief designer Len, on behalf of the bureau, I thank you once again for developing such an advanced laser weapon.</p>
<p>General Jeang suddenly stopped and solemnly gave Lynn Chin a standard military salute. His eyes filled with admiration and gratitude. Lynn Shan was slightly takenback, then straightened up and returned the greeting solemnly, his gaze firm and calm. General, you&#x27;re too kind. This is simply my duty as a researcher.</p>
<p>It is my honor to contribute to the country&#x27;s defense. Good. That&#x27;s enough. General patted Lin Shan on the shoulder excitedly, his eyes full of approval. He&#x27;s growing to admire Lin Chin more and more.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s impeccable in every aspect. Just then, suddenly, an engineer exclaimed in surprise. Chief Engineer Lynn, it seems there&#x27;s an enemy target rapidly approaching our airspace. Everyone looked at the satellite monitoring screen. On the screen, a small red that is rapidly approaching the airspace of the Great Sa Kingdom from the direction of the Sakura Kingdom.</p>
<p>Altitude 20,000 m. Speed Mach 0.8. The technical soldiers brought by General Jeang quickly stepped forward to analyze the situation. A conclusion was reached quickly. Yes, it&#x27;s the US&#x27;s Global Hawk.</p>
<p>They are rapidly invading our airspace from the direction of Japan. They want to conduct close reconnaissance. The US&#x27;s Global Hawk. General Ciangs face instantly darkened and his smile vanished completely. Those bastards.</p>
<p>Do they really think our great Sia&#x27;s airspace is their backyard? Do you still want things to be the same as before where you can come and go as you please? He turned to look at Lyn Shun, his tone I see. Chief engineer Lynn, can we shoot down this drone? Yes, Lynch replied simply, but you can hear the certainty and confidence in his tone. Just one word, but it works better than any guarantee. Excellent. General immediately ordered.</p>
<p>Take it down. Let the Americans see that their toys won&#x27;t work here. Lynn Shan turned to the engineer and ordered, &quot;Lock onto that drone and destroy it.&quot; &quot;Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn.&quot; The engineers were excited and immediately began to operate the equipment. They&#x27;re using the US Global Hawk drone. Something that&#x27;s exciting just to think about.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the high alitude reconnaissance aircraft that the US claims to be invincible. They used to frequently appear near the airspace of the Great Sa Kingdom for close-in reconnaissance because it&#x27;s at an altitude of 20,000 m. The great sea kingdom had absolutely no way to deal with it. Each time we can only watch helplessly as the US provokes us. Now they actually have the opportunity to personally operate the superpowered laser cannon and shoot down that arrogant Global Hawk.</p>
<p>The laser cannon quickly locked onto the Global Hawk drone. Immediately afterwards, the laser cannon began to charge. In an instant, another terrifying white light appeared. It was even brighter than before, shooting straight into the sky. Everyone looked up at the sky but could not see the drone but the little red dot on the screen.</p>
<p>At the instant the white light was emitted. It disappeared instantly. There wasn&#x27;t even a trace of signal left. That&#x27;s it. General Jeang paused for a moment after the small red that on the screen disappeared.</p>
<p>Haha. We&#x27;ve destroyed America&#x27;s Global Hawk. Invincible. This laser cannon is amazing. Let&#x27;s see if the US drones will dare to approach our airspace again.</p>
<p>Staff Officer Wong and the others became thoroughly excited. As military personnel, they deeply resent the US&#x27;s Global Hawk drones. Now I don&#x27;t have to be afraid of it anymore. General Jeang walked to the screen and watched the replay three times. He suddenly laughed and the laughter brought wrinkles to the corners of his eyes, patting Lin Shan on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, O Kobayashi, what you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t building weapons. You&#x27;ve built an iron wall for our great sa. If the US dares to come and wander around again, let&#x27;s shoot down all their planes and satellites. Lynshan nodded, his gaze fixed on the distant shooting range. That&#x27;s not all.</p>
<p>This laser cannon can also be mounted on warships in the future when our aircraft carrier battle groups go out. We no longer have to fear missile attacks. Great. Excellent. General Jeang became more and more excited as he listened.</p>
<p>Suddenly remembering something, he turned to his staff officer and said, &quot;Go back and draft a report immediately. Request that headquarters prioritize equipping the army and navy with laser cannons.&quot; Staff Officer Wong stood at attention. &quot;Yes, sir. Let&#x27;s go now.&quot; Then he left in a hurry. At this moment, Lynchin suddenly took out a small handle from the side and introduced it to General Jeang.</p>
<p>General, this is our latest laser sword. Would you like to see if it&#x27;s suitable for your army? Chapter 29. an individual weapon. The Global Hawk was shot down. What the heck? General Jeang was taken back.</p>
<p>They immediately realized what was happening. His eyes widened instantly, filled with shock. You&#x27;re saying this is a laser sword? He swallowed hard and reached out to take it. It feels cool and heavy to the touch. It&#x27;s definitely not a toy model, a lightsaber.</p>
<p>Staff Officer Wong leaned closer, his voice trembling. The laser cannon just now pierced through 10 layers of steel plates, which was already quite revolutionary. There are still lightsabers now. Isn&#x27;t that something that only exists in science fiction movies? They actually developed it. Even Lie Jian Guo was surprised.</p>
<p>Previously, Lynn Shun had only communicated with him about laser cannons. The issue of lightsabers was not mentioned. Unexpectedly, Lynchin secretly managed to get it working. Lynshin didn&#x27;t explain much, took back the lightsaber, and pressed his finger on the button on the side of the handle. Buzz.</p>
<p>A pale blue light blade suddenly shot out half a meter long like solidified lightning and remained steadily in the air. The wind blew, but the light blade remained completely still. Oh my god. Lie Jang Guoo adjusted his reading glasses and strode closer. He dedicated his life to scientific research and has seen many cuttingedge technologies.</p>
<p>But this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen a lightsaber, something that only exists in science fiction movies. Can it cut things? General Jeang rubbed his wrinkled, calloused hands together, his eyes full of anticipation. Definitely, Lynch nodded slightly, looking into the distance. There were still piles of special steel plates used for the previous laser cannon tests. It is 10 cm thick, which is thicker than the armor of a typical light tank.</p>
<p>Two engineers immediately carried over a piece and placed it on the iron support. Lynchin walked over. The pale blue light blade gently sliced across the special steel plate. There was no friction sound. No sparks, just like slicing tofu with a knife.</p>
<p>Laugh. The steel plate split in two like butter that had been poured with hot water. The cut was so smooth it could be used as a mirror. Not a single piece of steel slag came off. H.</p>
<p>General Jeang gasped and rushed over to examine the smooth cut. This thing is a hundred times better than a military knife. Invincible in close combat. General Jeang stared intently. This is absolutely a must-have for individual soldiers.</p>
<p>Staff Officer Wong and the technicians were visibly shocked, their eyes burning with admiration. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out. A moment later, General suddenly turned around, clinging to Lin Chin&#x27;s arm. His voice trembled. Kobayashi.</p>
<p>Can this amazing artifact be mass-produced? Our border guards on the southwestern border desperately need this. The southwestern border region is mountainous with complex terrain, especially the areas where the three kingdoms meet. There is frequent friction, but we can&#x27;t use guns. Only wooden sticks and steel pipes can be used. With lightsabers, border guards can absolutely wipe out those Indian bastards without leaving a single survivor.</p>
<p>General Jeang stared intently at Lyn Shun, his eyes filled with urgency. It&#x27;s compatible with laser cannon production lines. We can manufacture it with a little modification, Linshin said casually. Good, good, General Turned to Staff Officer Wong and shouted. Write it down.</p>
<p>Laser swords will be prioritized for the southwestern border defense. We need to coordinate with the General Assembly logistics department first thing tomorrow morning. Mass production must begin as soon as possible. Staff Officer Wong quickly pulled out his notebook, almost dropping the pen, his face beaming with excitement. Next, General Jeang personally tested it.</p>
<p>Like a child getting a toy for the first time, their excitement was impossible to hide. He brandished his lightsaber, the pale blue blade drawing graceful arcs in the air. They were having a great time. Staff Officer Wong was scolded for trying it out. It&#x27;s clear how much General treasured his lightsaber.</p>
<p>At the same time, one hour ago, the United States has a base in Okinawa, Japan. Commander Hansen sat in his office. A cigar was held in his mouth and smoke swirled around him. The air defenses of the great sea kingdom. They&#x27;re completely helpless against our global hawk.</p>
<p>Hansen scoffed. He stuck the cigar but into the ashtray. Sparks flying everywhere. Commander is wise. The agitant beside him nodded and bowed.</p>
<p>The Global Hawk is currently at an altitude of 20,000 m and a speed of Mach 0.8. Even the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s radar cannot lock onto it. Hansen leaned back in his leather chair, looking arrogant. Let it get closer and capture a clearer picture of the test site at the Seyaku Academy. I want the people of Dasha to know that our eyes are always watching their every move.</p>
<p>The agitant was about to pick up the walkie-talkie to relay the instructions. Suddenly, the screen displaying the Global Hawk live feed flickered. Then it directly turned into a snowy screen. Meanwhile, the Global Hawk drone lost contact. What happened? Hansen sat up abruptly, his brows furrowed.</p>
<p>The signal might be down. The agitant rushed to the computer, his fingers flying across the keyboard. No, it&#x27;s a complete loss of contact. We can&#x27;t reach them on any frequency. Lost contact.</p>
<p>Hansen shoved his agiton aside and stared at the screen. Investigate. Investigate immediately. Is it equipment malfunction or is it signal interference from Japan? The agitant&#x27;s forehead was covered in cold sweat. He retrieved the Global Hawk&#x27;s last transmitted data.</p>
<p>Commander, it&#x27;s not a malfunction, nor is it interference. In the last frame, there is a white light. White light? Hansen&#x27;s face instantly darkened. What white light? It&#x27;s like a laser. The agitant&#x27;s voice trailed off, and he didn&#x27;t dare lift his head.</p>
<p>Laser. Impossible. Hansen suddenly stood up and frantically shook his head in denial. Their laser weapons can only reach a maximum range of 50 km and are also affected by the weather. How could it possibly hit a global hawk hundreds of kilome away at an altitude of 20,000 m? He didn&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>I absolutely do not believe it. How could the technological level of the great Sea Kingdom suddenly surpass that of the United States? Investigate again. Investigate repeatedly. Hansen roared, spittle flying onto his agitant&#x27;s face. The agitant dared not stop.</p>
<p>They retrieved the data and replayed the final footage over and over again. The result is the same. The global hawk was destroyed by laser. Hansen&#x27;s face went from flush to ashen, then to deathly pale. He had been mocking the great SI kingdom, but now his face was burning with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Report this immediately. Hansen grabbed the phone, his fingers trembling. CIA headquarters, Trib&#x27;s office. The door was suddenly kicked open. An agent rushed in, his face pale and his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Chief, urgent report from Okinawa base. The Global Hawk drone has been destroyed by the Great Sea Kingdom using laser weapons. What? Trif looked up abruptly, his eyes bloodshot, as if he wanted to devour someone. Another laser weapon from the Great Sea Kingdom. The agent nodded, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Yes, technical analysis shows it was caused by a laser weapon. Bang! Tribe slammed his fist into the wall, his knuckles instantly breaking and bleeding profusely. &quot;The Great Sea Kingdom.&quot; He gritted his teeth, his voice sounding as if squeezed out from between them. Just how much advanced technology are they hiding? Quantum chips weren&#x27;t enough. Now they&#x27;re bringing in laser weapons.</p>
<p>Previously, the Great Sa Kingdom broke through the semiconductor blockade. This has already shaken the United States technological hegemony. Now even the global hawk has been shot down. How can the US continue to act arrogantly on earth? Tribe grabbed another encrypted phone. His voice is cold as ice.</p>
<p>Send a telegram to old ghost immediately. No matter what method you use, you must obtain the technical data on the laser weapon within 3 days. No matter the cost. There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone, followed by a cold yes. Tribe hung up the phone and slumped into his chair.</p>
<p>He looked at the world map on the wall where the location of the great Sia Kingdom was circled in red. His eyes were full of ruthlessness. He cannot lose. Absolutely not. Otherwise, there won&#x27;t be any room for your buttocks.</p>
<p>He&#x27;ll die a horrible death then. The great Sia Kingdom, a courtyard in Beijing. Xiawei is organizing some data. He was in his early 50s, wearing a white lab coat with slightly messy hair and thick black rimmed glasses, looking dull and unremarkable. A typical passerby.</p>
<p>My phone suddenly vibrated in my pocket. It is an encrypted message. Zia paused for a moment, then looked around. Everyone in the lab was busy with their own things, and no one paid any attention to him. He quietly took out his phone and opened the message.</p>
<p>There was only one sentence on the screen. Activate target laser weapon technology. Xiaoui&#x27;s forehead instantly broke out in a cold sweat. He is the spy that the US planted in Great Sea. Codeen named old ghost.</p>
<p>He had been lying low for 20 years. For the past 20 years, he has remained inactive. Work and live like a real person. He thought he would never be activated. You can live a peaceful and stable life in Dasha.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I&#x27;m still being asked to start it up. Zias expression became complicated. On one side was the great SIA kingdom which had raised him. On one side is the US military to which he has sworn allegiance. But he knew he had no choice.</p>
<p>If he refuses, the US will abandon him. He was doomed to die. Completing the mission might offer a glimmer of hope. Laser weapons for the great empire. I will definitely get it.</p>
<p>He turned around and began tidying up the documents on the table. Next, we need to find a way to infiltrate the peripheral team of the Seyaku Academyy&#x27;s laser weapon laboratory. If he can get close, he has plenty of ways to steal data. Chapter 30, Operation Eagle Extermination. A major cleanup.</p>
<p>3 days later, Xiaoui Gang returned to the courtyard. The door wasn&#x27;t closed yet. Sudden, several dark figures rushed into the courtyard. Before Xiaoi could react, click. Zia felt a chill on his wrist.</p>
<p>His hands were already handcuffed. Xiaoui, code name old ghost, a CIA undercover agent, right? The security agents voice was icy. Zia snapped out of his days and his whole body trembled. His face instantly went from pale to ashen. How? How did you know? His voice trembled and his teeth chattered.</p>
<p>He thought he had hidden himself perfectly for 20 years. I didn&#x27;t expect that. They were arrested by the security bureau just 3 days after they started their operation. It was obvious that he had been targeted for a long time. However, the security bureau has not arrested him yet.</p>
<p>Security personnel did not respond to him. His cell phone was found on him. The encrypted communicator hidden inside the old-fashioned mobile phone was disassembled. Inside were all his communication records with the CIA. Zia collapsed to the ground instantly.</p>
<p>Cold sweat soaked his entire back and he stood there frozen as if struck by lightning. The security agent looked at him coldly and continued, &quot;You think your disguise is flawless? But in fact, we noticed your unusual behavior a long time ago. Will you recruit them yourself or will we let you recruit them? I I confess. Xiaoi completely broke down. At this point, resistance is pointless.</p>
<p>The US has pawns in great sea. Their contact information is the security officer nodded. You&#x27;re smart to know what&#x27;s good for you. Then Zia was taken away. Meanwhile, security personnel also began arresting other US spies identified by Xiaoui.</p>
<p>The whole night the great Sia Kingdom incidents of people coming to read water meters have occurred but it didn&#x27;t attract the attention of others. The next day security bureau headquarters looking at the interrogation report Jun felt both relieved and a little scared. Fortunately, the laser weapon exposed them. Otherwise, who knows how much damage it will cause in the future. Report this matter to higher authorities and also notify the SA Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Jean Junfi first called his superiors to report. Then carrying an interrogation report. They went to the Syaku Institute. Syaki Yuan Li Jang Wos office. Kobayashi.</p>
<p>The production line for laser swords has been upgraded. We can now produce 100 lightsabers per day. Lie Jang Wos tone was full of excitement. Ever since that day when I tested the lightsaber, the general logistics department actively contacted the Siaku Academy. The production line was transformed in just 3 days and mass production began.</p>
<p>Only the Great Sa Kingdom can achieve this speed. Good. The earlier the better. The sooner our soldiers on the southwestern border can be equipped. A hint of anticipation also appeared in Linen&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>After learning about the hardships faced by border guards in the southwest, he decided that he must pass on more advanced weapons and equipment in the future so that the soldiers will no longer suffer any injustice. When provoked, dare to fight back. Give the enemy a good beating. This will deter them from having any further thoughts of overstepping the boundaries. To achieve this effect, the Great Sa Kingdom must possess a strong national defense force.</p>
<p>Advanced weaponry is a crucial support for national defense. Lie Jian Guo was about to continue speaking. Then I heard a knock on the door. Come in. The office door was opened.</p>
<p>Jean Junfi walked in carrying a report. Dean Lee, it&#x27;s been a long time. Chief Engineer Lynn, you&#x27;re here too. Perfect timing. Li Jang Wo stood up and said with a smile, Director Jeang, what is it now? Lynn Shin smiled and nodded, which was a response to Jean Jun.</p>
<p>Jean Junf stopped smiling and then slowly explained. After listening, Lynn Shun was filled with disdain for the US&#x27;s actions. Want to steal his technology? Dream. Just like they said before, even if we give them the technical data, they still can&#x27;t build it because many technologies have undergone his special processing. Without his guidance, the current level of technology on Earth would not be able to achieve this at all.</p>
<p>After listening, Li Jang Wo laughed and said, &quot;Director Jang, it seems you&#x27;ve caught a big fish this time.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot; Jeang Junf nodded. I actually came here this time to seek your opinions on how to deal with those spies. Should we deal with them directly or try to utilize them? Upon hearing this, Lynn Chins eyes lit up. What if we could use it? Then let&#x27;s give the US a big gift in return. I&#x27;ll slightly modify the parameters and let them try to replicate it.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo was a little worried. Shaolin, Isn&#x27;t this a bit risky? Lynchin smiled and said confidently. Don&#x27;t worry, they definitely won&#x27;t find anything wrong with it. Once they successfully develop it, they&#x27;ll find that it was all a huge trap. Really, that&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Jeang Jun Fe exclaimed excitedly. Let&#x27;s do as chief engineer Lynn says. Lynchin immediately took action. Not long after, a brand new laser weapon technology plan was released. Jean Jun Feay left excitedly with the fake technical solution in hand.</p>
<p>A devilish smile crept across Lin Chen&#x27;s lips. Mr. Eagle, you can take your time to study it. When they succeed, they will definitely give you a big surprise. At the same time, that afternoon, the military held a press conference.</p>
<p>The hall was packed with reporters. Domestic and international cameras were all focused on the podium. The military spokesperson, dressed in a crisp uniform, walked with a steady gate. He held a document in his hand and placed it on the table. Today&#x27;s press conference is mainly to announce one piece of news.</p>
<p>The spokesperson&#x27;s calm voice carried throughout the venue through the microphone. 3 days ago, a Global Hawk drone illegally intruded into our airspace. After being discovered by our side, we shot it down with laser weapons. The words had barely left his mouth. The reporters in the audience were instantly stunned.</p>
<p>What? Shot down a global hawk drone. Wow. That drone was at an altitude of 20,000 m. After the initial shock, foreign journalists raised their hands, eager to ask questions. The military spokesperson did not take questions.</p>
<p>Instead, he simply had his assistant play a video. Everyone, please look at the big screen. on the big screen. This is the flight path of a reconnaissance and strike drone taking off from the Okinawa base and heading straight for Otica&#x27;s airspace. It was instantly destroyed by a laser beam.</p>
<p>This is the evidence. The military statement was sharp and assertive, continuing its doineering tone. Let me emphasize again, our airspace is not anyone&#x27;s backyard where they can come and go as they please. If this happens again, it won&#x27;t just be drones that we shoot down. All the reporters in the audience were shocked by the military spokesperson&#x27;s assertive declaration.</p>
<p>This is the first time we&#x27;ve seen such a sharp and doineering declaration from the great SA kingdom. Never before. Many astute journalists have already discerned that the great SEA kingdom is about to unshath its sword. The world&#x27;s gay gaju, a term referring to the overall structure or pattern of the world is about to change. They all relayed the news back to their home countries.</p>
<p>Eagle the president&#x27;s office. President Otto was so angry while watching the live broadcast that he smashed his coffee cup on the ground. Fragments were scattered all over the ground. they actually dared to do that. He roared and slammed his fist on the table.</p>
<p>Trivet pushed open the door and came in holding a document in his hand. Mr. President, the laser weapon data sent back by old ghost has been preliminarily verified by the technical team and it is genuine. President Otto&#x27;s anger subsided by half in an instant. He grabbed the documents and quickly flipped through them.</p>
<p>A range of 100 km, a power attenuation rate of 30%. It&#x27;s not as good as I expected, but it&#x27;s enough. Trif nodded. As long as we master the technology, we can overtake them. President Otto took a deep breath.</p>
<p>My fingers turned white from squeezing so hard. Bear with it. Let laying hold more press conferences to condemn Great Sa for undermining regional peace. But don&#x27;t bring up the technology. We&#x27;ll teach them a lesson once we&#x27;ve built our laser weapons.</p>
<p>Triff responded and turned to leave. President Otto stared at Shwang Gu&#x27;s face on the screen. His eyes were filled with ruthlessness. The great Sia Kingdom. This time, I&#x27;ll let you be smug first.</p>
<p>Once our laser weapons are ready, we&#x27;ll see who&#x27;s stronger. Siakiuan Lynshin watched the military&#x27;s press conference. My heart is filled with emotion. At the same time, we are even more determined to accelerate the inheritance of more advanced weapon and equipment technologies. Let the great SA kingdom stand at the pinnacle of this world.</p>
<p>Laser weapons are now basically in the final stages of deployment. He will soon be able to unlock the next technological legacy. Next, we need to carefully consider which technology to choose. Chapter 31, a new crisis. As videos of the military press conference circulated online, the entire internet was in an uproar.</p>
<p>The military statement instantly became a trending topic. Top 10 trending topics. Great Sia military&#x27;s doineering declaration. Global hawk was struck by laser and fell to the ground. The eagle&#x27;s backyard theory has completely failed.</p>
<p>This is what the great sea should look like. Open the comment section. The whole place was filled with the sound of boiling water. My dad is a veteran of the Air Force. He burst into tears while watching the live broadcast.</p>
<p>He said that he finally got his revenge for the incident in the South China Sea. After all these years of holding back, &quot;Finally, we don&#x27;t have to be beholden to the US anymore.&quot; The US used to say, &quot;My planes can fly wherever I want, but what about now? Dare to fly into great Sia&#x27;s airspace again? Laser weapons are awesome.&quot; The military spokesperson is even more awesome. That line, &quot;Next time it won&#x27;t just be drones that we shoot down,&quot; gave me goosebumps. I suggest showing the video of the Global Hawk being shot down to the US on a loop. There were also messages from veterans.</p>
<p>An ID user named Old Squad Leaders Steel Gun wrote, &quot;Back when we were guarding the border, we could only watch the American Reconnaissance planes flying overhead with binoculars. It was so frustrating. Now with laser weapons, they dare not come again.&quot; A bunch of nizens replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, old squad leader. Well protect our country from now on. Many people are watching videos on their phones.&quot; My fists clenched unconsciously.</p>
<p>It was a mix of excitement and relief. In recent years, China has been held hostage by the United States in too many ways. From chips to aviation, from materials to equipment. I can only endure it each time. Watching the US reconnaissance planes hovering around the border.</p>
<p>How many companies are struggling to survive due to chip sanctions? But during this period, they all made breakthroughs. Now, the great Sia Kingdom can finally stand tall and say no to the world. The excitement in China hasn&#x27;t subsided yet. The internet abroad is in an uproar. The Sakura Kingdom forum is filled with doubts.</p>
<p>Baka, how could the laser weapons of the great Sia Kingdom be so advanced? The video must be a composite. If our F15JS can&#x27;t do it, what makes them think they can? It must be fake. The great SIA is deceiving itself. South Korea is even more outrageous. Post on a well-known forum immediately rose to the top spot.</p>
<p>Dasha&#x27;s laser technology originated from South Korea. We published a theoretical paper on laser weapons 10 years ago. A crowd below echoed, &quot;That&#x27;s right. Great Sia stole our country. We must make them return the technology.&quot; Someone quickly retorted, &quot;You can&#x27;t even make a straight rifle barrel, and you&#x27;re talking about laser weapons? Where&#x27;s your shame? The post caused such a disturbance that the administrator locked it.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Americans are relentlessly questioning the White House. President Otto Brookhausen demands an explanation. Why was the global hawk shot down? What were our intelligence agencies doing? We give the CIA billions of dollars every year, and all we get in return is a I don&#x27;t know. Now that Great Sea has laser weapons, will our planes still be able to fly safely? We strongly urge the military to take action. We cannot allow great Sia to be so arrogant.</p>
<p>While the dispute was raging overseas, Lay Mang Duo held a press conference. The press conference was packed with people. Lay Mang Duo was wearing a dark suit and his face was as long as a donkeys. Immediately slammed his fist on the table and shouted, &quot;This action by Great Sia has severely undermined regional peace and stability. The illegal downing of our civilian reconnaissance equipment is a blatant provocation.</p>
<p>We demand that great sia apologize immediately and hand over its laser weapon technology as compensation for our losses. She had barely finished speaking. A reporter from Dasha stood up abruptly, his voice clear and loud. Madam Secretary, first I must correct one of your mistakes. The Global Hawk is a military reconnaissance aircraft, not some civilian equipment, a fact known to the international community.</p>
<p>Secondly, according to international law, any country has the right to shoot down aircraft that illegally intrude into its airspace. Does the fact that the US has repeatedly sent reconnaissance aircraft close to great Sia&#x27;s airspace in recent years count as undermining peace? And how big is your face? Do you want our laser weapon technology, too? Laying&#x27;s face stiffened, and he was rendered speechless by the question. He pointed at the reporter, trembling with anger. You? She suddenly stood up and pushed aside the staff member next to her. Wearing high heels, she walked backstage without looking back.</p>
<p>The reporters kept pressing for answers. Miss Secretary of State, aren&#x27;t you going to explain? Is it because your US laser weapon technology is outdated? Soon, the video of Lay Ming Duo being confronted by a reporter from the great Sea Kingdom went viral again. Laying Duo was so easily provoked that he broke down. Laying age is confirmed as an inside agent. Both topics immediately went viral and became trending topics.</p>
<p>Netzens couldn&#x27;t stop laughing. Every time Laying appears, she helps Dia generate buzz. What else could she be but an inside agent? I suggest the US investigate whether she&#x27;s receiving a salary from great sia. Don&#x27;t hold any more press conferences. If you keep doing that, the US will lose all face online.</p>
<p>There are completely different attitudes towards the press conferences of the great SIA kingdom and the United States. For the great Sia Kingdom, it was a mixture of shock and admiration. To the Americans, it&#x27;s to mock their shameless behavior. No matter how heated the internet gets, Lynchin didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it. At this time, Siaki Yuan Li Jang Wos office.</p>
<p>Sunlight streamed through the window and fell on the documents on the table. Li Jang Guoo sat on the sofa, his brows furrowed tightly. He was holding a report in his hand, his knuckles turning white. Oldly, what&#x27;s wrong? Lynchin pushed the door open and saw his appearance, his brows furrowing slightly. Lie Jian Guo pushed the report over and sighed.</p>
<p>The laser weapon is a success, but we&#x27;re still stuck on the aviation engine. Lynchin picked up the report and glanced at it. High temperature alloy materials, completely embargoed by foreign countries. Domestically produced materials, have a lifespan of only 800 hours. Similar products from the US have a lifespan of 2,000 hours.</p>
<p>Single crystal blade processing precision is substandard with a yield rate of only 30% far below international standards. The core control system relies on imported chips and the supply has been cut off. Li Jang Wos voice was low and tinged with helplessness. We have been working on this problem for years, but foreign countries are still keeping the formulas for high temperature alloys and the processing technology for single crystal blades to themselves. The turboan engines we build ourselves will have to be replaced after a short period of flight.</p>
<p>Fighter jets are a bit better, but transport planes and passenger planes mostly still have to rely on imported engines. If foreign countries cut off supplies, our planes will have to stay on the ground. Looking at the report, Lynchin suddenly remembered a technology in the inheritance space that could solve this problem. Oldly perhaps this constraint can be broken soon. Lie Jian Guo suddenly looked up, a hint of anticipation flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p>You have another idea? Okay. Lynshin nodded emphatically, his voice clear. I&#x27;ll go back and think of a solution now. Lie Jian Guo stood up instantly, his voice trembling with excitement. Xiain, are you sure? Confirmed.</p>
<p>Lynchs tone was calm yet firm. If laser weapons can be developed, so can aircraft engines. Great Sa cannot be tough only with laser weapons. The planes in the sky must also use our own engines. Well said, Lie Jang Wos eyes were full of approval.</p>
<p>He continued, Shaolin, don&#x27;t put too much pressure on him. It&#x27;s okay if he can&#x27;t think of anything. He was afraid that Lynchin would put too much pressure on him and cause unnecessary trouble. Lynchin&#x27;s efforts have been enough. Moreover, aircraft engines are much, much more difficult to develop than the other technologies.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a challenge on a completely different level. He didn&#x27;t want Lynchin to fall into a predicament of self-criticism because of being too persistent. Lynshan sensed Li Jang Wos concern and smiled. Don&#x27;t worry, Mr. Lee.</p>
<p>I know what I&#x27;m doing. After saying that, he left first. In the inheritance space, there is an aircraft engine that is very suitable for the current Great Sea Kingdom. Anti-gravity plasma engine. Chapter 32.</p>
<p>Anti-gravity plasma engine. The capital city is brightly lit at night. The lights of thousands of homes twinkle, filling the city with the vibrant energy of life. Siakiuan apartment building. Lynchin returned from the Siaku Academy.</p>
<p>The worries Lee Gian Guo had about domestically produced a engines during the day kept echoing in his mind, and the report on the lifespan and yield rate of the aero engines was simply shocking. I never imagined that China&#x27;s aero engine industry is still so far behind. However, now that he knows, he will naturally have to fix this weakness. After washing his face with cold water, Lynn Shun lay down on the bed with eyes tightly closed. Consciousness directly enters the inheritance space.</p>
<p>Buzz. After the familiar feeling of weightlessness, his consciousness has arrived in the inheritance space. New technology unlocked. Please select select the anti-gravity plasma engine. Lynchin made his choice without hesitation.</p>
<p>The next second, a massive stream of data flooded my mind. Looking at the technical principles of anti-gravity plasma engines, Lin Shun was deeply shocked. This anti-gravity plasma engine, it uses a brand new type of alloy material which is lightweight, has high hardness, and is resistant to high temperatures. The core rotor uses anti-gravity technology. It can provide a strong anti-gravity force as the rotor rotates to achieve vertical takeoff and landing of aircraft.</p>
<p>This also saves the aircraft&#x27;s thrust. Fortunately, the entire technology includes a new alloy material formula that is both hard and heatresistant. Otherwise, with the current materials available for aircraft engines on Earth, it simply wouldn&#x27;t meet the requirements. Moreover, this engine does not have any traditional rotating parts. According to the technical data, a 100% yield rate can be achieved.</p>
<p>As for lifespan, it starts at 100,000 hours. Advanced Arrow engine in the United States. Awesome. This is more than just an aircraft engine. It&#x27;s perfectly applicable to all aircraft.</p>
<p>Gravity plasma engine, Lin Shun. I was deeply shocked once again. It truly deserves to be called a seed of the Chinese civilization, a level 9 civilization in the universe. The cuttingedge technology here is at the forefront of current civilization. With this engine, the aerospace industry of the great Sia Kingdom took off directly from its original location.</p>
<p>It can even be used in the civilian sector after being castrated. directly developed new means of transportation. After the initial excitement, Lynshin started working inside the inheritant space laboratory. He started with new alloy materials. At the same time, the US Las Vegas laser weapon laboratory.</p>
<p>Supervisor Jim looked at the laser technology plans stolen from the Great Sea Kingdom with great excitement. God, the people of Great Sa are truly incredibly intelligent. To think they could come up with such a perfect solution. Other researchers were also deeply impressed. Manager, this plan is real.</p>
<p>With just a slight modification to their energy control logic, we can break through the 100 km range. Then what are we waiting for? Work overtime. Everyone work overtime. Samples must be available next week. I want the White House to know that we are the best on Earth.</p>
<p>Jim gave the order with great excitement. The entire laboratory instantly erupted in excitement. No one doubted that there was a problem with the plan. After all, this was obtained by the intelligence agency from the SIA Academy of Sciences in the Great Sea Kingdom. So, it must be their most advanced solution.</p>
<p>One week later, Eagle Labs, a silver laser emitter stood in the center of the testing area, its metal casing gleaming coldly. Jim, wearing a white lab coat, stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes filled with excitement. Adjust the power to 80% and aim at the target 10 km away. Fire. The technician pressed the button.</p>
<p>A white light suddenly shot out, but it did not hit the target as expected. Boom! With a loud bang. The launcher exploded into pieces. The heatwave overturned the testing platform, sending plumes of black smoke shooting out. The staff in the vicinity were severely injured by the debris.</p>
<p>Jim was stunned. The smile on his face froze instantly. He froze for 3 seconds before screaming in terror. &quot;W! What happened? Where&#x27;s my transmitter?&quot; A researcher held up a newly released technical report, his voice trembling. Supervisor, the plan is fake.</p>
<p>It contains a self-destructive logic. If the power exceeds 5%, it will explode. What? It&#x27;s fake. Jim snatched the report, glanced at it, and then ripped it up. The great SEA people lied to us.</p>
<p>Those bastards in the CIA have ruined us. Call an ambulance immediately. After Jim finished setting up the scene, he turned around and rushed out, heading straight for the CIA. CIA headquarters, Trib&#x27;s office. Bang.</p>
<p>The door was kicked open. Jim burst in, grabbed Triff by the collar, his eyes bloodshot. What kind of crappy technology did you provide? The lab exploded. Three engineers are seriously injured. All the equipment is destroyed.</p>
<p>Triff, struggling to breathe and looking completely bewildered, cried out. Fake. Impossible. This was sent back by old ghost. He&#x27;s been undercover for 20 years.</p>
<p>How could he make a mistake? I&#x27;ve tested it myself. How could it be fake? Jim roared. You confirm it for me now or you&#x27;ll be facing a military court. Trife immediately instructed the technician to send a telegram. 10 minutes later, the technician rushed in, his face deathly pale.</p>
<p>Chief, we can&#x27;t reach you. Old ghost&#x27;s signal has been lost, and the three spies who were previously infiltrated have all disappeared without a trace. Tri&#x27;s face turned ashen instantly. He shoved Jim aside, staggered back two steps, and slammed his fist against the wall, his knuckles turning white. Damn it.</p>
<p>The great SEA people captured our spy, and they deliberately gave us a fake plan. They&#x27;re playing us. Jim froze, then grew even angrier. What do we do now? Our laser weapon project is completely ruined. Trif didn&#x27;t say anything.</p>
<p>Staring at the world map on the wall, the location of the great Sia Kingdom felt like a thorn in his eye. He knew that this time they had really messed up. Let&#x27;s go find President. So the White House, the Oval Office. Otep smashed the cup on the ground.</p>
<p>Shards flying everywhere. He pointed at Triff, his roar nearly lifting the roof off.  Is the CIA just sitting around doing nothing. All the hidden agents are gone, and they even got a fake technology. You, as the bureau chief, don&#x27;t want to be in this position anymore.</p>
<p>Trif kept his head down, not daring to utter a sound. The defense minister beside him quickly interjected. Mr. President, now is not the time to assign blame. We must retaliate.</p>
<p>Counterattack? How can we counterattack? Otep gasped for breath, his eyes fierce. The laser weapon botched. The satellite was shot down. And now we don&#x27;t even have our hidden agents. Sanctions.</p>
<p>The defense minister gritted his teeth. Increase the sanctions. No aircraft engines or aircraft engine materials may be sold to the great Sia Kingdom. Let their plane stay grounded forever. Let them know the consequences of opposing us.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll do. Otep&#x27;s eyes lit up and he slammed his hand on the table. Issue an announcement immediately. Anyone who dares to sell to Great Sia is going against us, the American Empire. OTP seemed to already see the scene of Great Sea coming to the US for help after being sanctioned.</p>
<p>Chapter 33. Sanctions. Prepare for destruction. The sanctions announcement from the United States was issued immediately. The entire US-led alliance began to express their views.</p>
<p>Japan, we fully support the US&#x27;s sanctions plan. South Korea, we will fully support whatever the US wants to do. Australia, support our eagle leader. Philippines, support. European nations, a complete ban on sales, which has absolutely nothing to do with aircraft engine materials, has joined in the fun.</p>
<p>Even Russia remained silent. This demonstrates the rise of the great Sia Kingdom during this period. This has caused many countries on Earth to begin to feel a sense of crisis. Meanwhile, the internet was in an uproar. The US has started again.</p>
<p>I wonder how great Seia will deal with it this time. Yoshi, great. We must suppress the arrogance of the great Sia Kingdom. Damn it. This time, the Great Sea Kingdom will definitely kneel down.</p>
<p>As expected, the US will definitely retaliate. On the entire international internet, no one is optimistic about the great Sia Kingdom this time. After all, there are only five places on the entire planet Earth that can manufacture aircraft engines. The Great Sea Kingdom was one of them. However, many materials need to be imported.</p>
<p>Once sanctioned, the Great Sa Kingdom will face a shortage of materials for its aircraft engine manufacturing. The Great Sia Kingdom, the internet is in an uproar. The trending topics are all about the US sanctions. Damn it, is that bald eagle pulling the stun again? Damn it, has the US gone mad? They want to impose sanctions on everything. Damn it.</p>
<p>I heard that many materials used in the development of our domestically produced aero engines are from abroad. This sanction means the Chinese people are outraged by this news. During this period, the great SEA kingdom was filled with joy over several technological breakthroughs. But the moment the US issued this announcement, it instantly filled the Chinese people with anger and resentment. But there was nothing we could do.</p>
<p>We can only hope that the great Sia Kingdom can break through the blockade as soon as possible. One week later, office of the dean of the Academy of Sciences. Lie Jian Guo stared at the computer screen, his eyes filled with anger. Damn the US. Trying to repeat the same trick again.</p>
<p>The technology of the great Sia Kingdom has advanced by leaps and bounds during this period. The localization of a engine production is also accelerating. It will take at most 2 years to achieve complete domestic production. We no longer need to rely on imports. But the US is now launching the harshest sanctions.</p>
<p>They gave us absolutely no time to make a breakthrough. Hateful. Lie Jian Guo clenched his fist and slammed it on the table with resentment. Knock knock knock. The door was kicked open.</p>
<p>Engineers from the large aircraft agine RD team rushed in. Their eyes read. Deanley. We&#x27;ve received news from overseas that the entire batch of monoristalline wafers we ordered has been intercepted. Our large aircraft has already had its fuselage assembled.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just waiting for the engines now. Now we don&#x27;t even have any spares. Wong, the leader, spoke with a voice filled with anger and resentment. The other engineers all kept their heads down and no one spoke. But their eyes were filled with anger, resentment, and unwillingness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the atmosphere in the entire office became oppressive. They clenched their fists, their knuckles turning white, their eyes red- rimmed. Lasers can clearly hit US satellites. A 1 nanometer quantum chip has also been created. Even solid-state magnetic field batteries are already in mass production.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Aerero Engine Corporation of China ACC is being bullied and bullied. Wong and his colleagues were truly unwilling to accept this after all this hard work. Is it all going to be for not? Looking at them, Li Jang Guoo felt even more depressed. He wanted to offer comfort but couldn&#x27;t bring himself to speak. The facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Without an engine, even the most advanced aircraft is just a pile of scrap metal. Just then, the office door was pushed open. Lynchin walked in and carrying his laptop. Old Lee, Engineer Wong, don&#x27;t worry. I have a plan for the aircraft engine.</p>
<p>Everyone looked up abruptly. Engineer Wong was taken aback for a moment, then gave a rice smile. Chief Engineer Lynn, I know you&#x27;re capable, but an aero engine isn&#x27;t a chip. His meaning was quite clear. Aero engines have absolutely no connection to chips or laser weapons.</p>
<p>In fact, aircraft engines are far more complex and sophisticated than the other two technologies. It is a systems engineering project that integrates multiple high technologies. It wasn&#x27;t that he didn&#x27;t believe in Lynch&#x27;s abilities. It&#x27;s more like a completely different world when you&#x27;re in a different field. Engineer Wong, they&#x27;re all the same.</p>
<p>How about you take a look at my proposal instead? As Lynchin spoke, he turned on his computer and then clicked on the anti-gravity plasma engine proposal. Really? Wong Gong asked doubtfully, then leaned closer to take a look. Anti-gravity plasma engine? What&#x27;s this? He&#x27;d heard of anti-gravity? I&#x27;ve also heard of plasma engines. But when put together, it becomes a bit abstract. Is this something that current technology on Earth can achieve? Regarding anti-gravity technology alone, no country has yet taken it out of the laboratory.</p>
<p>These are all just theoretical techniques. The same applies to plasma engines. He has never even been inside a laboratory. These are all technologies imagined by scientists. But now Lynshin directly combined the two technical solutions together.</p>
<p>Is this even possible? Lie Jian Guo also came over and when he saw the name of the plan, he was a little incredulous. Shaolin, is this is this real? Of course. Lynch nodded. I&#x27;ve already calculated the plan and it&#x27;s definitely feasible. Whether it&#x27;s a new type of alloy, it still relies on the core rotor anti-gravity technology.</p>
<p>All of these can be easily achieved. Moreover, this engine has a lifespan of at least 100,000 hours and a 100% yield rate. 100,000 hours. Engineer Wongs eyes were filled with shock. He told Lynchin to scroll down directly.</p>
<p>Vertical takeoff and landing. No imported materials. All domestically produced materials. The cost is onetenth of that of current aircraft engines. He suddenly looked up, staring at Lynn Shun, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Chief engineer Lynn, are you sure you&#x27;re not joking? Your lifespan is 50 times longer than the most advanced aircraft engine in the United States. The cost is that low? How is that possible? Lynn Shin didn&#x27;t explain and directly opened a parameter report. The above are the actual parameter reports from the tests he conducted in the inheritance space. Engineer Wongs gaze shifted, and after only a few glances, his voice began to tremble. Is this real? 100 times stronger than the most advanced materials currently available abroad.</p>
<p>Guaranteed authentic, Lynchin answered with utmost seriousness. Instantly, Wongs eyes reened with emotion, and his voice choked with emotion. Haha, our large aircraft project finally has hope. And our fighter jets, finally, we don&#x27;t have to keep changing engines. The engineers in the office also gathered around to look at the plan and parameters.</p>
<p>Wow, these parameters are terrifying. Is this really something that we humans can achieve? Chief engineer Lynn is simply a genius. He can even come up with such a technical solution. Everyone was filled with excitement, shock, and admiration. All the frustration and anger from before vanished in that moment.</p>
<p>With this engine, the US can just wait to be destroyed on the spot. Li Jang Guoo looked at Lin Shan, his eyes welling up with tears. Shaolin, you you&#x27;ve given us another huge surprise. He pointed to the plan on the computer screen. With this, the US sanctions are a joke.</p>
<p>Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;Oldly, this is just the beginning. This engine can not only be installed on airplanes, but also on our spacecraft in the future. Even with some modifications, it can be adapted for civilian passenger planes and transport aircraft. They can even use rockets. Rockets can be used.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo was instantly overjoyed. Doesn&#x27;t that mean we can also make reusable rockets? That&#x27;s right. Lynch and nodded. Theoretically, it&#x27;s all achievable. The specific design will depend on the rocket&#x27;s requirements.</p>
<p>Great. Li Jang Guoo slapped his thigh excitedly. Immediately afterwards, he stood up abruptly and went straight to close the office door. Then with a serious expression, he said to engineer Wong and the others, &quot;Please put all your phones on my desk.&quot; After saying that, he immediately called Jeang Jun Feay of the State Security Bureau. Lynshin&#x27;s technology is extremely important.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so important that it concerns the fate of the entire Great Sea Kingdom. It must be processed at the top of the page. Without any objection, Wong and the others handed over their phones and waited where they were. At the same time, the White House of the US holding the report of victory after the sanctions, OTP smiled smugly. Without our supply, Great Sia&#x27;s aircraft engines can only stand still on the ground.</p>
<p>The Secretary of Defense nodded. Mr. President, it won&#x27;t be long before they&#x27;re begging us. Chapter 34. The Suzaka project is established.</p>
<p>Not long after, there was a rapid knocking on the door of Li Jang Wos office. Dean Lee, this is Jeang Junfi from the State Security Bureau. Li Jang Wo quickly opened the door. Five people in black training uniform stood outside the door, their epolettes gleaming coldly. Jeang Junfi walked in with a black folder in his hand and no smile on his face.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn Dean Lee. He nodded to the two of them first. Then addressing Wong Gong and the others solemnly, he said, &quot;Gentlemen, we have received orders from the Supreme Commander. Anti-gravity plasma engine technology is classified at the highest level.&quot; That&#x27;s right. He reported the news to the chief before he came.</p>
<p>The latest instructions are that the anti-gravity plasma engine project must be kept under the highest level of secrecy. This is the highest level of security classification. It is only used for certain projects and events that involve the fate of the nation. Lynch&#x27;s current identity is at the highest level of confidentiality. Outside, no one can find out Linen&#x27;s true identity.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Wong Gong and the others were immediately filled with shock. They realized that the importance of this technology was far greater than they had imagined. Jean Junf continued seriously. Next, please cooperate by registering your identity information. We need to investigate the background of three generations of relatives.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, the person behind him immediately stepped forward and took out a tablet computer. Then I went to register Wong Gong and the others. Wong Gong paused for a moment. Then his fingers flew across the screen. He thought of his son studying at university in China and his parents being elderly retired workers, so he had no worries.</p>
<p>Other engineers also registered one after another. Some people were so nervous that they were sweating profusely. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m worried about my identity or background being discovered. It was the first time I&#x27;d encountered something like this, and I instinctively felt nervous until you see the background check past message. They all breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>This indicates that they are now eligible to participate in this top secret project. Jeang Junfi picked up the printed confidentiality agreement. Each document was stamped with the red seal of the security bureau. That&#x27;s right. There are no issues with your identities or backgrounds.</p>
<p>Next, sign the confidentiality agreement. His tone was calm, yet it conveyed an undeniable authority. Engineer Wong was the first to take the lead, picking up the confidentiality agreement and signing it without the slightest hesitation. Wait until the last person signs. Lie Jang Guo suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>Old Jang, I need to call an emergency expert meeting. It&#x27;s all arranged. Jang Junf nodded. Clear the conference room, evacuate all irrelevant personnel, and activate signal jamming. Lynch watched them handle the situation quietly.</p>
<p>He was already thinking about how to maximize the value of this technology. This engine can be used in large aircraft, fighter jets, and rockets. It can completely fill the gap in China&#x27;s aero engine field and surpass all other countries on Earth. Half an hour later, the top floor conference room of the Seyaku Academy. More than 30 experts and missians with gray hair filled the entire room.</p>
<p>Almost everyone&#x27;s face was filled with doubt. Old Xiao, what urgent project is it this time? An older expert asked his colleague next to him. The expert named La Xiao shook his head. I don&#x27;t know either. I just came straight here after receiving the notification.</p>
<p>The other senior experts andmians looked at each other in bewilderment trying to glean something from other people&#x27;s expressions. But to their disappointment, almost everyone wore a puzzled expression. At this moment, Lie Jian Guo and Lynch walked in. Instantly, everyone&#x27;s eyes were on Lynch. Chief Engineer Lynn, why is he here? Could this project be related to him? All the experts andademicians showed expressions of surprise.</p>
<p>They had heard of Lin Chin&#x27;s name like thunder. Almost every project related to Lin Shun is an important one. Lynch&#x27;s appearance suggests that another new technology project may be initiated. Thinking of this, all the experts and missians were excited. Their eyes were burning with desire as they looked at Lynch.</p>
<p>Lynch found his seat and sat down. Lie Jang Guoo stepped onto the podium. He tapped the microphone, his voice serious. Everyone, I&#x27;d like to inform you of two things before the meeting. First, from this moment forward, suspend all engine development projects for active duty fighter jets, large aircraft, and rockets, including subsequent improvements to the WS5 turboan engine.</p>
<p>What? The audience erupted in uproar. An elderly expert suddenly stood up. Dean Lee, the WS15 turboan engine is about to be finalized. How can we stop? What will we do if our large aircraft are grounded? Will we just wait to be held hostage by foreign countries? Another voice chimed in. Then one by one, they stood up and voiced their opposition.</p>
<p>The WS5 project is the result of their painstaking efforts. It looks like it&#x27;s about to be finalized. Now they&#x27;re saying they want to pause. This will kill them. We strongly oppose it.</p>
<p>Even if it costs them their lives, they will save the WS15 project. At this moment, even the veteran experts and missians have prepared for the worst. Lyn Shan, who was standing to the side, was deeply moved as he watched this scene. It is because of these veteran experts and missians. They dedicated their youth and passion to the country&#x27;s scientific and technological endeavors.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of their dedication that Dashia has achieved its current technological leap forward. Lyn Shun had genuine respect for them. Lie Jian Guo looked at the experts below the stage who were getting emotional and raised his hand to calm them down. His gaze fell upon Lin Chun and then he slowly spoke. &quot;Everyone, please calm down.</p>
<p>Since I said I wanted to postpone these projects, there must be better alternative technologies.&quot; Kobayashi, the rest is up to you. Lynchin stood up, holding a black USB drive in his hand. He plugged the USB drive into the computer and the screen switched instantly. Anti-gravity plasma engine. The words were particularly jarring.</p>
<p>The entire room fell silent for 3 seconds. Everyone was stunned. Jeang Gong had when he first saw the technology. What? What is this? Anti-gravity plasma engine. Someone rubbed their eyes.</p>
<p>They thought they had misread it. This name immediately makes you think of something from a science fiction movie. How come it&#x27;s actually being brought into reality? That&#x27;s outrageous. Everyone turned to look at Lynshan, waiting for his explanation. Lynchin didn&#x27;t explain much and directly open the parameter table.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the technical specifications list. This engine has a lifespan of up to 100,000 hours. It uses a brand new super alloy material which is lightweight and low cost. Its thrust is 100 times that of comparable internationally advanced aero engines. This fear outrageous.</p>
<p>Everyone gasped in shock. My eyes were filled with nothing but shock. The old expert who had just objected pointed at the screen speechless for a long time. If this data is true in the aviation field of the great SEA kingdom, it can take off directly from the spot. A moment later, the veteran experts and missians recovered from their shock.</p>
<p>People started asking questions. Chief engineer Lynn, are you sure these parameters can really be achieved? A materials expert asked a question, his voice trembling. Lynshin nodded emphatically. It&#x27;s 100% possible. Really? That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>We are finally no longer held back by foreign countries in the development of cuttingedge materials. The materials expert was so excited that his eyes welled up with tears. So many years, the day has finally come. He has been deeply involved in this field for decades. They understand best the hardships and bitterness involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes even when you&#x27;re willing to pay for technical collaborations with others, you have to be humble and subservient. Others still won&#x27;t agree. Think about those difficult times in the past. He couldn&#x27;t help but sigh deeply, his eyes filled with emotion. Now with this anti-gravity plasma engine technology, all the hardships and difficulties will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>The other experts nodded in agreement, their faces beaming with excitement and anticipation. Then Lyn Shun continued to answer questions from the experts and missians. Each answer, all of this filled those experts and missions with shock and ecstasy. Li Jian Guo watched this scene quietly from the side. My heart is filled with emotion.</p>
<p>This has never happened at the Seyaku Academy before. Only Lin Chun could elicit such a strong reaction from these old guys. Much later, the experts and missians were finally convinced by Lynch. The atmosphere in the meeting room gradually shifted from initial skepticism and excitement to anticipation and excitement. At this moment, Lie Jian Guo returned to the podium and said loudly, &quot;Next, I&#x27;d like to announce the second thing.&quot; &quot;The Vermilion Bird Project is established with Lynshin appointed as the chief engineer.&quot; The words had barely left his mouth.</p>
<p>Lynshin stood up again, looking at the group of senior experts and missians. Everyone, Project Suzaku&#x27;s first objective. Within one month, we successfully manufactured the first prototype and began testing. No one had any objections. The Suzaka project was officially established.</p>
<p>Lynchin once again plunged into the busy work of tackling key projects. At the same time, it is located thousands of kilometers away on the southwestern border. Border guards also had their moment of glory. Chapter 35. The glorious moments of border guards.</p>
<p>Southwestern border. Border defense logistics department. Squeak. Crack. A military truck breaks suddenly, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Wong walked out from the logistics department. His dark face and calloused hands tell a story of the hardships he endured while guarding the border for many years. He stroed towards the truck, his voice booming. Comrade, has the new equipment arrived? He received word that a new piece of equipment would be delivered today. That&#x27;s why I came to the logistics department specifically to wait.</p>
<p>Yes. The driver nodded. Get out of the car and lift the rear curtain. The neatly arranged silver boxes inside were revealed. Commander Wong, this is the new equipment that the General Armaments Department ordered to be transported here.</p>
<p>Commander Wong nodded, but looking at how short the box was, he was a little puzzled. Battalion Commander Lee and Company Commander Xiao, who were standing nearby, also gathered around. Battalion Commander Lee looked curiously at the boxes inside the carriage. Rubbing his hands, which were red from chillblaines, his eyes were full of anticipation. What exactly is this new equipment? Company commander Xiao rubbed his rough hands and said anxiously.</p>
<p>Comrade, quickly open the box. Let&#x27;s see what new equipment is inside. Okay. The logistics soldiers jumped onto the train carriage. Take out the special key.</p>
<p>Open one of the boxes. The gray handles were neatly stacked inside. The metal casing gleamed coldly, and it was half a head shorter than a typical military dagger. This is Commander Wong stared at the handle inside, his face full of question marks. Battalion Commander Lee was also a little angry.</p>
<p>Are they trying to fool us? A bunch of lumps of iron and they call it new equipment. Company commander Xiao was even more furious. I want to see what this thing is good for. After saying that, he prepared to jump into the car to get the lightsaber from the box. At this moment, a technician on board quickly intervened.</p>
<p>Wait, this is a lightsaber. You can&#x27;t just take it without knowing how to use it. What the heck? A lightsaber? Commander Wong was completely stunned. Battalion Commander Lee exclaimed in surprise. Holy crap, you&#x27;re saying this thing is a lightsaber.</p>
<p>Company commander Xiao immediately pulled his hand back, looking completely bewildered. Damn it, you scared the crap out of me. Hearing the name lightsaber, everyone thought they had misheard. When did technology become so advanced, let alone them? I suspect it&#x27;s people who don&#x27;t know the situation. This is the reaction when you first hear it.</p>
<p>The technician picked up a lightsaber and began his presentation. This is the latest individual soldier equipment developed by the SEA Academy of Sciences, the laser sword. When you use it, just press the silver button on the side to unleash the light blade. Remember, never touch the blade. After saying that, the technician demonstrated the procedure to Commander Wong and his team.</p>
<p>After pressing the silver star button on the side, the handle originally looked like scrap metal. Blade half a meter long and 20 mm wide appeared instantly like a frozen lightning bolt. steadily suspended in the air. The wind blew, but the light blade remained completely still without even the slightest tremor. This scene, this left Commander Wong and his men completely stunned.</p>
<p>It really is a lightsaber. Commander Wongs eyes were filled with disbelief. Holy crap. Is this science fiction coming to life? Battalion Commander Lee subconsciously took a half step back. Company Commander Xiao was so shocked that he stood there motionless like a fool.</p>
<p>It was as if I had been acupunctured. A moment later. I&#x27;ll give it a try. Commander Wong stepped forward and picked up a handle. Follow the technicians instructions and pressed the silver star button.</p>
<p>Buzz. A pale blue light blade suddenly shot out half a meter long. It really is. Commander Wong was instantly excited. I wonder how powerful it is.</p>
<p>He casually swung his sword at the scrap steel pipe next to him. Laugh. The steel pipe looked like butter that had been poured with hot water. It was broken into two pieces. The clean cuts are so sharp they could be used as a mirror.</p>
<p>Piss. Battalion commander Lee gasped, his eyes filled with shock. Company commander Xiao finally snapped out of his days, exclaiming, &quot;Holy crap, this thing is an absolute godsend for individual soldiers.&quot; Regiment commander Wong handed the lightsaber to Battalion Commander Lee. Let me show you. After the test, register the equipment and distribute it.</p>
<p>Teach the warriors how to use it as quickly as possible. Battalion Commander Lee took the handle, activated the light blade, and said, &quot;If this were to hit an Indian, &quot;It&#x27;s so exciting just thinking about it.&quot; Commander Wongs eyes were resolute. If the Indians crossed the line again, we&#x27;ll use this magic weapon to deal with them. &quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot; Company Commander Xiao slapped his thigh excitedly. Let&#x27;s use this laser sword to roast them alive.</p>
<p>Soon, Battalion Commander Lee and Company Commander Xiao both tried it. Then, the border guards were summoned. distribute the lightsabers. Shiao is a new recruit. He had only been with the border defense force for six months.</p>
<p>He stood at the front of the line, his eyes filled with curiosity. Soon, the lightsabers were distributed to Shiaho. He took the lightsaber and brandished it a couple of times. Then, following the technicians instructions, the laser sword was activated. The moment the light blade appeared, Shiaho shouted excitedly, &quot;Holy crap, that really is a lightsaber.&quot; The squad leader, standing to the side, patted him with his calloused hands and said with some advice, &quot;Don&#x27;t get excited.</p>
<p>Study hard and watch carefully.&quot; &quot;Remember, the sword must never be used against your own people. The blade should only be pointed at the enemy. Do you understand?&quot; &quot;Und?&quot; Shiao nodded vigorously. Then he turned off the lightsaber, held it in his arms, and protected it like a newborn child. The squad leader looked at the soldiers in his squad, his voice becoming serious.</p>
<p>You must remember for us border guards, the weapons in our hands are our very lifeline. Remember this. As long as the sword is there, the man is there. If the sword is lost, the man dies. As long as the sword is there, I am there.</p>
<p>If the sword is lost, I die. The soldiers shouted in unison, their eyes filled with determination. Half an hour later, all soldiers received laser swords. Commander Wong stood at the front of the ranks, his voice resounding. Recently, Indian soldiers have been loitering around the border marker, probably looking to cause trouble again.</p>
<p>You all remember this. If any Indians dare to cross the line, use this lightsaber to deal with them, regardless of life or death. Yes. All the soldiers responded excitedly. Next, they continued to familiarize themselves with the operation of the lightsaber.</p>
<p>A must- do skill is the chopping move. There are also high difficulty moves like the backhand grab. The soldiers became more and more excited as they trained. Even though the plateau was starting to get colder, it couldn&#x27;t stop them. Southwestern border, India&#x27;s border command.</p>
<p>Raj stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray, his muscular face trembling uncontrollably. He is the Indian border defense commander. His long-term stationing on the border has distorted his mentality. He looked at the map and said menacingly, &quot;It seems like a lot of things have been happening in the great sea region lately. Even the US&#x27;s global hawk was shot down.</p>
<p>Let the border guards of great sia become arrogant too. We can&#x27;t let them continue to be so arrogant. We must crush their arrogance. As he spoke, he turned to his agitant beside him and asked, &quot;Have you prepared the things I asked you to?&quot; The agitant pulled out a barbed iron rod from the side. &quot;Sir, ready? With these iron rods, well make the great Sia people suffer terribly and show them the might of our Indian kingdom.&quot; Raj took the barbed iron rod.</p>
<p>a sinister smile spreading across his face. Good. With this thing, the people of Great Sea will have no way to defend against it. At 10 p.m. tonight, organize 100 people to cross the border and smash their sentry post.</p>
<p>If the Great Sa people try to stop us, use this stick against them. Yes, commander. The agitant&#x27;s eyes were filled with excitement. Chapter 36. Border conflict erupts.</p>
<p>Lightsaber shows its power. Night. Border command post in India. Raj sat in the chair looking at the barbed iron rod in his hand. He sneered.</p>
<p>People of great sia I wonder if your iron will can withstand this iron rod. Just then the agitant walked in excitedly saying sir it&#x27;s 10:00. Is it time? Raj put down the iron rod in his hand. He stood up looking towards the border defense line of the great Sa Kingdom. His voice laced with a hint of ruthlessness.</p>
<p>You will personally lead the team and begin the operation immediately. Remember, hold nothing back. Yes, sir. Mission accomplished. The agitant replied excitedly.</p>
<p>Then he excitedly walked out of the command post. At this time on the border, 100 Indian soldiers are already waiting for orders. Each of them held the same barbed iron rod in their hand. Chatted idly while waiting. He he tonight will make the people of great sia suffer.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. So what if they have an iron will? Can they withstand the barbed iron bars in our hands? Tonight will be our highlight. All the Indian soldiers were full of confidence. They held the soldiers of the great Sia kingdom in utter disdain. At that moment, the agitant arrived, set off.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t hold back. His words were simple but full of disdain. Yes. All the Indian soldiers had fervent eyes. They were incredibly excited like they&#x27;d been injected with adrenaline.</p>
<p>Then, under the cover of night, they sneaked across the border. On the other side, Dasha border post. The sentry stood on the watchtower, his high-powered binoculars constantly fixed on the border line. Suddenly, he noticed something unusual happening in India. Soon, a group of soldiers was seen crossing the border and moving towards his post.</p>
<p>The commander was right after all. These Indian bastards are up to no good again. The sentry was not nervous at all. On the contrary, he felt excited. He quickly reported via walkietalkie, reporting to company commander Xiao.</p>
<p>About 100 Indian troops are sneaking into the Black Wind Pass Canyon. Black Wind Pass Canyon. There are steep cliffs on both sides and only one canyon road leads into the canyon. Narrow on the outside, wide on the inside. This location is also where conflicts frequently break out with India.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve arrived. Company commander Xiao asked excitedly upon hearing this. Then he gave the order directly. All personnel, listen to my command. As planned, 50 people armed with laser swords will head to Blackwind Canyon to wipe out the Indians.</p>
<p>Received. The soldiers were excited and moved swiftly. In addition to the gun, he brought a full set of individual soldier equipment. New recruit Shiaho had just finished preparing everything. Company commander Xiao suddenly drove up to him and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Shiao Zhao, you don&#x27;t need to fight this time. Go to the east cliff. Use a recorder to record the whole process. Xiao Xhas eyes lit up instantly, and he understood. &quot;Okay, company commander, I promise I won&#x27;t miss a single second.&quot; This was his first time participating in a conflict in the 6 months since he enlisted.</p>
<p>Not afraid at all. Some were excited. He was a little disappointed that he couldn&#x27;t participate in the battle directly. He&#x27;s really good at making videos. He loves making videos.</p>
<p>After confirming that all the soldiers were ready, company commander Xiao waved his hand. Set off. The 50 people were divided into five teams. Taking advantage of the darkness, we marched rapidly towards Black Wind Canyon. Excitement filled the eyes of every soldier.</p>
<p>Faced with such readily available military achievements, they could hardly contain their smiles. Half an hour later in Black Wind Canyon, the wind howled across the cliff face in the darkness, sounding like a whistle. 50 soldiers stood apart. It forms an encirclement around the open space in the canyon. The soldiers stood close to the cliff face, their lightsabers concealed.</p>
<p>Quietly wait for the prey to come to you. Not long after, footsteps could be heard at the entrance to the canyon. Shiao lay on the top of the cliff, his recorder pointed downwards. On the screen, 100 Indian soldiers walked in, crowding together. The lead agitant had just entered the canyon.</p>
<p>They then discovered the warriors of the great Sa Kingdom surrounding them. The agitant glanced around and estimated there were only about 50 people. Only 50 people. The advantage is in my hands. How can I lose tonight? The agitant was secretly thrilled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indian soldiers had already started mocking them. Tsk tsk. The great kingdom only has so few people tonight and they think they can stop us. Just 50 people and they didn&#x27;t even bring weapons. You dare to stop us like this? Who gave you the courage? Jesus.</p>
<p>Huh? The Indian soldiers chattered incessantly, making sarcastic remarks. It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;ve already won. The agitant walked to the center of the canyon and shouted in broken Chinese, &quot;Come out! I found you!&quot; The words had barely left his mouth. Company commander Xiao emerged from the darkness with an expressionless face and icy eyes. At the same time, 50 soldiers appeared and surrounded the Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>Shiaho, perched on the cliff face, has already started recording a video. Company Commander Xiao glanced at the Indian soldiers and said in an icy voice, &quot;Indian soldiers, withdraw from the borders of great sia immediately, this is your final warning.&quot; Upon hearing this, the Indian agitant looked at the 50 Great Sya soldiers surrounding them. Suddenly, he clutched his stomach and burst into laughter. Haha, warning us, just you 50 unarmed soldiers. Are you worthy? The other Indian soldiers also burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The laughter was full of mockery and disdain. The 50 soldiers from the great Sa Kingdom around him paid no attention. They looked at the Indian soldiers as if they were idiots. Laugh. If you don&#x27;t laugh now, you&#x27;ll never have a chance to laugh again.</p>
<p>Every soldier of the great Sia Kingdom was calculating how to get as many kills as possible once the battle began. These are all real battle achievements. Whether the family tree can be opened on a separate page depends on how fast you can type it in a moment. The soldiers even felt that there were fewer Indian soldiers this time. Company Commander Xiao ignored the laughter of the Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>The warning was shouted again. Final warning, leave the border, otherwise you&#x27;ll bear the consequences. On the clifftop, Shiaho quietly recorded a video. He had already guessed the company commander&#x27;s intention. Besides provoking India to strike first, it&#x27;s also about having a legitimate reason.</p>
<p>With this section, even if we go too far and killing India, India will have no choice but to endure it. Even if the case is taken to the International Court of Justice, they will still be in the wrong. Really? The agitant, who had been laughing maniacally, stopped abruptly upon hearing company commander Xiaos warning again. He looked at Captain Xiao, his tone full of disdain. As a result of, I&#x27;ll show you what happens when you anger me.</p>
<p>Listen to my command. Give them a good beating. Don&#x27;t hold back. Yes. 100 Indian soldiers are holding barbed iron bars.</p>
<p>like mad dogs unleashed from their cages, they charged at the surrounding great sea soldiers. When company commander Xiao saw this, a smug smile appeared on his lips. Then he immediately gave the order, &quot;Activate the lightsabers and begin the slaughter.&quot; Moment. Buzz, buzz, buzz. 50 pale blue light blades lit up instantly.</p>
<p>The light blade is half a meter long and 20 mm wide, like solidified lightning, hovering steadily in the air. The Indian soldiers at the forefront were completely bewildered. Then they laughed, &quot;Trying to scare us with a toy at a time like this? You really think you&#x27;re wielding lightsabers?&quot; As they spoke, the Indian soldiers continued to charge forward, wielding iron bars. They simply couldn&#x27;t believe that any country in the world could develop a laser sword. After all, those are just props from science fiction movies.</p>
<p>However, what happened next made those Indian soldiers regret it to the core. Company Commander Xiao, wielding a laser sword, shouted, &quot;Kill!&quot; Then he rushed toward the agitant, who was running at the front. The agitant instinctively swung the iron bar and smashed it down on company commander Xiao&#x27;s head. They wanted to severely damage company commander Xiao die. The first class merit his mind.</p>
<p>The agitant, watching the iron rod in his hand about to strike company commander Xiao, was filled with excitement. But the next second, the agitant&#x27;s smile froze. Company Commander Xiao lightly swung his laser sword at an incoming iron rod. Laugh. The iron rod snapped in two like butter poured with hot water.</p>
<p>What? The agitant&#x27;s pupils contracted sharply, thinking he was seeing things. It must be fake. He swung the remaining half of the iron rod and smashed it towards company commander Xiao&#x27;s chest. Company commander Xiao did not dodge. Instead, he slashed with the light blade.</p>
<p>H. The agitant&#x27;s hands, which were holding iron bars, were neatly severed at the wrists. Both wrists and the iron rod fell directly to the ground. You can even smell a curry meat aroma. The agitant looked at his severed hand, then at the lightsaber in company commander Xiao&#x27;s hand, and was instantly terrified.</p>
<p>Sudden, the agitant held up his hands, his face contorted in pain. Pain, retreat, retreat quickly. The agitant, enduring the pain, shouted the order. At that moment, he knew that the soldiers of the great sea kingdom on the other side were indeed wielding laser swords. Unfortunately, he realized it too late.</p>
<p>Giving the order now is too late. Those 50 soldiers from the great Sia kingdom had gone berserk. Ah, my hand, my arm. I surrender. Don&#x27;t kill me.</p>
<p>Screams and pleas for mercy echoed throughout the canyon. The Indian agitant witnessing this scene was utterly devastated. It&#x27;s over. This time it&#x27;s really over. The losses are so severe.</p>
<p>Even if he returns alive, his ultimate fate will be extremely tragic. 5 minutes later, battle over. The Indian soldiers were either killed or wounded. The rest of them dragged the wounded and scrambled out of the country. On the ground laid dozens of broken iron rods and a few drops of blackened blood.</p>
<p>The 50 soldiers of Dasha suffered zero casualties. &quot;Comp commander, we won. Zero casualties!&quot; a veteran shouted excitedly, his voice trembling. We won. We won.</p>
<p>The soldiers cheered. Chapter 37. 100 people were ganged up on by 50 watching the Indian soldiers flee in disarray. Company commander Xiao did not order his soldiers to pursue. This incident has already resulted in the deaths of 15 Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>This can be considered a heavy lesson for India. Although in accordance with international practice, our actions are suspected of violating regulations regarding the use of weapons. However, India invaded first. After repeated warnings went unheated, they took the initiative to attack first. Even if it goes to the International Court of Justice, India had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Company commander, what should we do with these bodies? A soldier asked, his eyes filled with excitement. As thought, company commander Xiao immediately gave the order. Throw it back to them. Don&#x27;t dirty our land. Receive.</p>
<p>The soldiers moved swiftly, dragging the stiff corpse. They walked towards the border in the darkness. Each corpse still bore the clean cuts made by the laser sword. After throwing it across the border, the soldiers returned. The Indians were terrified and dared not turn around.</p>
<p>As for when they will collect the bodies of their soldiers. That&#x27;s their own business. Company commander Xiao and the others arrived. He then led his team back to the company. Company commander Xiao didn&#x27;t even have time to drink water.</p>
<p>He immediately called Commander Wong to report. Commander Wong, you were right. The Indians really sent people to invade our border. Yes, they sent 100 men and we fought back with lightsabers. On the other end of the phone, Commander Wong asked excitedly, &quot;How&#x27;s the result effect?&quot; Zero casualties in our unit.</p>
<p>During our fierce resistance, we accidentally killed 15 Indians and injured 85 others. At the very least, they&#x27;ll lose a hand or a foot. There was a 2-cond silence on the other end of the walkie-talkie. Then came a crisp clang sound, like an enamel cup falling to the ground. What did you say? Commander Wongs voice trembled, filled with disbelief and excitement.</p>
<p>Zero casualties, 15 dead and 85 injured. Company Commander Xiao repeated it, his voice excited and thrilled. Yes, the lightsaber is an unparalleled close combat weapon, an invincible weapon. Good, Commander Wong replied succinctly. Company Commander Xiao continued.</p>
<p>We also recorded the whole thing on video. Would the regimental commander like it? Send it to me right now. Good. Company commander Xiao hung up the phone. They immediately asked Xiao Xhao for the video and sent it to Commander Wong.</p>
<p>On the other side, Border Defense Regiment Headquarters Wongs residents after hanging up the phone with Company Commander Xiao. Commander Wong was still in a state of excitement. Their dark faces turned bright red with excitement. 15 dead, 85 injured, zero casualties. These numbers are incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Only he, an old man who had guarded the frontier for 20 years, understood. This is perhaps the first time in so many years. The most exhilarating battle was fought on the southwestern border. Old Commander, you can rest in peace now. From now on, no one will dare to set foot on our border.</p>
<p>Anyone who comes will die. Commander Wongs eyes were bloodshot and tears blurred his vision. He comforted his old regimental commander in his heart because his old commander was involved in the conflict with India. He was beaten to death by bastards from India during the chaos. That tragic scene will forever be etched in the hearts of all border soldiers.</p>
<p>At that time, if it weren&#x27;t for the intervention from above, he&#x27;s about to lead his troops across the border to seek revenge. Because at that time, the great Sea Kingdom was not as powerful as it is today. Often, we have to consider the bigger picture. Today, I finally gotten my revenge because of lightsabers, because of technological advancements, because our motherland is strong. There is no longer any need to worry about the tragedy repeating itself.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s India&#x27;s turn to worry about its own safety. Commander Wong clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white from the force. Just then, a ding sounded on my phone. Commander Wong wiped away his tears and took a deep breath to calm himself down. He opened the video sent by the company commander.</p>
<p>The more I looked at him, the more interesting his expression became. Good. Good for killing the enemy. After reading it, Commander Wong was so excited that he slapped his thigh. With this video, there&#x27;s nothing to worry about anymore.</p>
<p>However, this matter still needs to be reported to the Army Group headquarters. No matter what, the other side also suffered 100 casualties. Given the nature of the Indians, they definitely won&#x27;t stop. Kind of trouble they&#x27;ll cause this time. It would be better to let the Army Group headquarters handle it.</p>
<p>It was almost 11 p.m. even though but without hesitation, Regiment Commander Wong immediately dialed the duty phone number of the Army Group headquarters. The call was connected, Commander Wong said sternly. Hello, this is Commander Wong of the Border Defense Corps. Please transfer me to the commander.</p>
<p>I have an urgent military report to report. Yes, Commander Wong, please wait. Not long after, a calm and authoritative voice came from the other end of the phone. Xiao Wong, what urgent military situation is there so late? Regiment commander Wong excitedly reported, &quot;Commander, fantastic news tonight.&quot; After listening to the phone call, there was a 10-second silence on the other end. Then the commander&#x27;s steady voice rang out again, tinged with barely concealed excitement.</p>
<p>&quot;Shia Wong, are you sure what you&#x27;ve said is true?&quot; Wonguan instinctively straightened up. &quot;Really? I&#x27;m willing to sign a pledge.&quot; &quot;Good. You did a great job. I&#x27;ll send someone over right now to find out the details. At the same time, I will report this matter to my superiors.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll be rewarded. After saying that, the phone was hung up. After tidying up a bit, Commander Wong went to the regimental headquarters to wait for the people from above. On the other side, border command post of the three countries. The agitant dragged his severed hand, his face contorted in pain.</p>
<p>He stumbled and rushed into the command post. Raj was sitting in a chair with his legs crossed on the table, puffing out smoke. Hearing the noise, he instinctively looked towards the door. Upon closer inspection, he was so startled that he jumped up from his chair. They didn&#x27;t even bother to put the cigarettes away.</p>
<p>His face darkened as he asked, &quot;What happened?&quot; The agitant immediately knelt down on the ground. He accidentally touched the ground with the wound on his hand, and the pain made him convulse. &quot;Sir, sir, we failed. The great SA people, they have lightsabers. Our iron bars are cut in two at the slightest touch.</p>
<p>Even my hands were severed at the root with a gentle flick of the wrist from the other side. What? Raj was stunned, not even noticing the cigarette in his hand fall to the ground. A lightsaber. What kind of international joke are you talking about? He rushed over, grabbed the agitant by the collar, his eyes fierce. Damn it.</p>
<p>How could something from a science fiction movie possibly exist in reality? It must be you, you idiot, who got ambushed by the other side. You&#x27;re just afraid of dying, so you ran away and came back, aren&#x27;t you? The agitant burst into tears. His face stre with grievance. It&#x27;s true. The lightsabers of the great Sia people are too powerful.</p>
<p>We had 100 people, and we were ganged up on by 50 people on the other side. Only 85 of us returned, all of them with severe injuries, including broken hands. 15 people will remain forever. By the end, the agitant had lost his voice. At the same time, it was also because it was too painful.</p>
<p>His wound was originally only given simple treatment. I accidentally bumped into the ground again, which worsened my wound. He has managed to hold on until now. That already shows an extremely strong will. Raji&#x27;s face turned deathly pale when he saw his agitant&#x27;s miserable state.</p>
<p>He let go and the agitant fell to the ground with a thud. Is it true? Light swords have appeared in the great Sia dynasty. If headquarters finds out that the troops have suffered such heavy losses because of me, what will happen? That Raji took two steps back. He pllopped down in the chair, his eyes vacant. No, we absolutely cannot say that we provoked them.</p>
<p>Just say that the great SA kingdom has invaded us. Then we fought back fiercely, but were still surrounded and attacked by the Great Sia Kingdom, resulting in significant losses. Yes, that&#x27;s how you report it. Chapter 38. India is furious.</p>
<p>The great sa kingdom must provide an explanation. After Raj made up his mind, he gave the agitant a stern warning. Let him join in deceiving those above. Did you understand what I just said? In this way, you will all become heroes of the country and receive substantial compensation. Otherwise, you can expect to be shot.</p>
<p>The agitant nodded repeatedly in fright. I understand. I&#x27;ll go talk to those soldiers right away. Choose between becoming an imperial warrior and dying. he would definitely choose the former.</p>
<p>After saying that, the agitant endured the pain and walked out of the command post. He was going to ask the other soldiers to keep the secret. Raj also picked up the phone and dialed the Indian army&#x27;s border headquarters. Headquarters emergency. 500 people from the great sea kingdom have invaded our border.</p>
<p>Our army sent 100 men to put up a tenacious resistance. But the great sea kingdom used illegal weapons and we suffered heavy losses. Ultimately, this resulted in 15 deaths and 85 serious injuries. The person on the other end of the phone was silent at first, then roared, &quot;Are you telling the truth?&quot; Raj&#x27;s forehead was covered in cold sweat. He blinked repeatedly and said in a trembling voice, &quot;It&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>Even my deputy had his hands chopped off. The other soldiers suffered terribly. It was all because the great Sia Kingdom used illegal weapons.&quot; At the end, Raj even pretended to cry. &quot;Okay, I got it. take care of the wounded and wait for this person to go over for investigation.</p>
<p>The call ended. Raj wiped away a bead of cold sweat. Then he hurriedly left the command post. He also needed to keep an eye on the agitant. We must do a good job of addressing the concerns of all wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Midnight, a military jeep arrived at the border of India and Afghanistan. The group got off and went directly to the wounded soldiers camp. They then began questioning the wounded soldiers. The results were very consistent. They all said the same thing as Raj.</p>
<p>When it comes to lying, no one can compare to India. It&#x27;s the same from top to bottom. That is precisely why those soldiers were lying. His expression didn&#x27;t change at all. The investigators even went to the border to take a look.</p>
<p>While we&#x27;re at it, let&#x27;s drag those 15 corpses back with us. The next morning, the news reached the Indian military headquarters. The generals at headquarters surrounded the battle report, their faces ashen. No one could believe that such a serious conflict would occur on the border. Getting injured is one thing.</p>
<p>It even resulted in the deaths of 15 people. This is absolutely a major conflict incident. Even if you don&#x27;t want to believe it. However, there are photos of the mutilated bodies of agitants and soldiers. There are also photos of the deceased soldiers remains.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to believe it. This matter is beyond our ability to handle. I must report to his excellency the prime minister. All the generals looked grave and nodded in agreement. They dared not delay and immediately reported to the prime minister&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>India, the prime minister&#x27;s rest area. Demo the immortal is eating curry rice. He grabbed a handful of rice coated in golden curry. Then several generals walked in with panicked expressions. Smack.</p>
<p>Before he could even put the rice in his mouth. He slammed it hard onto the plate. Why did you all come together? The leading general reported in a deep voice. The situation is like this. Upon hearing this, Demo the immortal instantly flew into a rage, his beard bristling with anger.</p>
<p>Asshel, how dare the great Sia kingdom. They actually sent 500 people to invade our border, and it caused such heavy casualties among our soldiers. The enraged old immortal demo wouldn&#x27;t question the truth of the matter at all. After all, it was several high-ranking military officials who came to report at the same time. It must have undergone a rigorous investigation.</p>
<p>Demo the immortal looked at the photos and videos recorded by the investigation team on the tablet. He became even angrier, his eyes seeming to spit fire. He roared, &quot;Excellent! What a magnificent Sia Kingdom! They invaded our border and used illegal weapons. This is absolutely intolerable. Pass on my orders.</p>
<p>The military should issue a public announcement immediately. We strongly condemn the great Sia Kingdom. We demand that they use illegal and lethal weapons and that they provide an explanation and compensation. Otherwise, don&#x27;t blame us for launching a massive attack. Soon, the military of the three countries issued a public announcement to the world.</p>
<p>He also specifically tagged the Great Sea Kingdom and the Blueest Star Alliance. The Great Sa Kingdom disregarded international conventions, blatantly invaded our border, and illegally used lethal weapons, causing serious harm to our border guards. strongly condemn. We demand an explanation from the great Sya kingdom and compensation for our losses. Otherwise, we India will not hesitate to wage war to avenge our country.</p>
<p>Once the announcement was issued, the first to react strongly were nitizens in India itself. The great SA kingdom must hand over the murderer. We must take revenge. No one can bully our India. Revenge.</p>
<p>We must get revenge. As the news spread, more and more young people in India are learning about this. They gathered together holding up banners and chanting various slogans. They all hoped that the great Sia kingdom would hand over the murderer and compensate them India. Otherwise, they would also support the government sending troops to avenge the loss.</p>
<p>This scene, this is also what Demo the Immortal wanted to see. He also hopes to use this opportunity to win over the hearts and minds of the people. This will increase his approval rating. At the same time, the international internet exploded instantly. A nizen from Japan commented, &quot;Yash, the Great Sea Kingdom used to call us militarists.</p>
<p>What do they say now?&quot; A South Korean nizen commented, &quot;The Great Sea Kingdom must be condemned. Their blatant invasion of another country must be severely punished to uphold peace.&quot; An American nizen commented, &quot;The Great Sea Kingdom is disrupting regional peace. They should be sanctioned.&quot; A European nizen commented, &quot;Oh my god, isn&#x27;t the Great Sa Kingdom supposed to be peaceloving? Why would they do something like this? A Middle Eastern nizen commented, &quot;The veracity of this matter is debatable. We&#x27;ll have to wait for an official announcement from the Great Sia Kingdom.&quot; Babon commented, &quot;It must be that India invaded the Great Sia Kingdom itself, suffered heavy losses, and now it&#x27;s turning around and biting the hand that feeds it. The entire international network.</p>
<p>The whole thing has turned upside down because of an announcement from India. The image of the Great Sia Kingdom has also been seriously questioned. However, the image of the great Sia Kingdom as a peaceful nation has been deeply ingrained in people&#x27;s minds. Many people have expressed doubts about the announcement issued by India. There are only photos and videos of the injured, but no on-site video.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can be inferred that India may have been lying on its own. Many international friends are waiting for an official response from the Great Sia Kingdom. At this time, the internet in the Great Sia Kingdom was in an uproar. Haha, great. Finally, we&#x27;ve seen India suffer a huge loss.</p>
<p>Awesome. No matter who invades, it&#x27;s great to see India suffer a huge loss. Those Indians who kept causing trouble on the border have finally suffered a great loss. I hope our lovely soldiers are not injured, nothing else matters. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>As long as our people&#x27;s liberation army soldiers are not injured, it doesn&#x27;t matter if all the Indian soldiers die. Almost all the people of the great Sia Kingdom were extremely excited about this. The internet erupted in cheers. As to who invaded whom, it doesn&#x27;t matter. They only hoped that the people and soldiers of the Great Sa Kingdom would be safe and sound.</p>
<p>But they also want to see an official response. The whole world is waiting for the official response from the Great Sia Kingdom. Chapter 39. The official joke is the most lethal. Siaki, Li Jang Wos office.</p>
<p>Haha. Kobayashi, your laser sword has done a great job. Lie Jian Guo looked at the battle report sent to him by the military. his face beaming with joy. That smile was as radiant as a flower blooming in spring.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Lynchin asked curiously, &quot;What&#x27;s going on? Didn&#x27;t it just start mass production and be equipped by the military? How come you have such good results so quickly? Could it be that another conflict has broken out on the border?&quot; Lie Jian Guo handed the tablet to Lynch. You&#x27;ll understand after watching this video. Lynch took the tablet and then opened the video. Watching the entire video, Lyn Shan was filled with surprise. Indeed, the power of the lightsaber has been proven.</p>
<p>He finished praising someone. His voice suddenly turned cold. Eh, those little bastards from India, they think they can cause trouble on our border. Our border guards are too lenient. They should all be wiped out.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Li Jang Guoo thought to himself, &quot;Wow, 15 people were killed in India. Yet, Lynchin still felt it wasn&#x27;t enough. It seems that the person in front of me is also a hidden conservative.&quot; Lie Jian Guoo patiently explained. Shaolin, if we really kill all 100 people, it will definitely trigger a war. War breaks out, Lynshin said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Does India dare to? It&#x27;s not that he underestimates India. Instead, it is based on the current military strength of the great Sia Kingdom. Once war breaks out, the battle of New Delhi may well repeat itself. Moreover, the time may be even shorter because vehicle-mounted laser cannons have already begun mass production. Previously, it was fired horizontally from anti-aircraft guns and then it was handled by military courts.</p>
<p>However, when the laser cannon is laid flat, the damage to infantry and tanks is even more terrifying. Furthermore, the development of shipborne laser cannons has entered its final stage. It can be deployed immediately. After all, the warships of the Great Sea Kingdom are equipped with superpowered laser cannons. At sea, they are invincible.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x27;s for air defense or offense, they are all unstoppable. Therefore, Lynchin was never worried that India would start a war. It would be best to fight a match. Let the whole world witness the terrifying fighting power of the great Sia Kingdom. Lie Jian Guo was speechless.</p>
<p>Lynch&#x27;s reaction. It&#x27;s obvious she didn&#x27;t listen to his advice. Sure enough, all conservatives are the same, but this is for the best. Given Lin Chin&#x27;s current status, it&#x27;s understandable that he would have such an attitude. This might be a good thing for the Great Sa Kingdom as well.</p>
<p>At the very least, the equipment he develops is definitely primarily conservative. Just as Lie Jian Guo was about to say something more, his phone suddenly vibrated. Upon picking it up, I saw it was a call from General Jeang of the military. He picked it up immediately and after listening to just a couple of sentences, a look of shock appeared on his face. The military wants to unveil the lightsaber.</p>
<p>Should they ask Chief Designer Lynn for his opinion? Okay, he&#x27;s right here with me. I&#x27;ll ask him right now. Li Jang Wo looked at Linshin. Lynn Shin nodded. Tell them to release it without worry.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no need to worry about the technology being leaked. Chief engineer Lynn has agreed. So there&#x27;s no need to worry about the technology being leaked. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go take a look later. The call ended. Lie Jian Guo still had an excited expression. He looked at Lin Shun and said with emotion, Little Lynn, it seems that the way things are done above is starting to change. if it were before.</p>
<p>When faced with this kind of situation, the most I can do is give a simple response. But unlike now, they won&#x27;t directly release the live video. They even want to announce the groundbreaking equipment that has just been deployed. It&#x27;s obvious the military is about to unshath its sword. Moreover, it&#x27;s a real show of force.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s good, Lynch smiled, expressing his approval of the military&#x27;s approach. A strong nation should demonstrate its strength. Give the people confidence and make the enemy wary. That way, no one will dare to provoke us anymore. As more groundbreaking equipment is developed in the future, the grudges of the past should still be settled.</p>
<p>The blood of our martyrs must not be shed in vain. This was Lin Chin&#x27;s hidden thought. However, now is not the time. The military capabilities of the great Sia Kingdom have not yet reached that level. He will acquire more cuttingedge technology from the inheritant space.</p>
<p>after it was developed in reality. It&#x27;s a time to settle scores and seek revenge. Lie Jian Guo did not respond to Lyn Shun, but instead opened the military&#x27;s official website directly. A red pinned announcement popped up on the homepage. The title is both eye-catching and cathartic.</p>
<p>Statement regarding the border conflict with India. The truth hurts more than lies. Below the announcement, it&#x27;s a 5-minute video. Lie Jian Guo already knew the content without even watching the video. The video ends with the official statement.</p>
<p>India claims we&#x27;ve violated regulations. Which international law prohibits the use of lightsabers? The Indians say we invaded. Sorry, it&#x27;s you who invaded our great Sia kingdom. The Indians say we ganged up them. Indeed, 50 soldiers from our great Sia kingdom ganged up on 100 of yours.</p>
<p>Therefore, India demands an explanation from our great SA kingdom. Or don&#x27;t blame us for retaliating. Li Jang Guoo after reading to the end was speechless. When did our military start using internet memes? Lynchin felt this reply was excellent. Oldly this is exactly how the military should act.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see who dares to provoke us again. You liang Guo shook his head helplessly, but his eyes were full of relief. However, the unveiling of this lightsaber will definitely trigger a new arms race around the world. Lynchin remained calm. Wouldn&#x27;t that be even better? The arms race had no impact on the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>It can also distort the military research and development of those countries. The technology he acquired from the inheritant space for earth. At present, it is almost impossible to develop such a technology independently. Even if those countries manage to obtain samples, they won&#x27;t be able to reverse engineer them. There are many parameters and details involved.</p>
<p>Even a slight difference can lead to vastly different results. Moreover, he applied multiple layers of encryption and special processing to each technology. Even if you disassemble the lightsaber into parts and placed them in front of foreign researchers, they still can&#x27;t defend against it. After reading the military&#x27;s announcement, has Lynch continued working on his Suzaka project? A new alloy material has begun trial production. Once the samples are ready, we&#x27;ll start testing various parameters.</p>
<p>Once the alloy materials are ready, we can begin processing various parts on the other side. On the internet, the official announcement from the Great Sea Kingdom has already stirred up a huge uproar. Comments from Chinese nizens flooded the comments section faster than a rocket. The screen is filled with excitement and exhilaration. Holy crap, what have they done to me? A lightsaber has appeared.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me? Are you sure this isn&#x27;t a science fiction movie? Damn it. Is the nation about to start a space race? I&#x27;m not ready yet. Can you wait for me? The video released by the military is definitely real. Company Commander Xiao in the video is really handsome. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>That final warning was so satisfying. Company Commander Xiao deserves a major commendation. Haha. 50 people ganged up on 100 Indians, zero casualties. Who else can do that? Hilarious.</p>
<p>India dares to demand an explanation from us. They&#x27;d better explain why they invaded our border. After all the nizens of the great Sia Kingdom saw the video, they all felt a surge of excitement. So many years. Finally, we see the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of the Great Sea Kingdom once again wreaking havoc on all sides.</p>
<p>No more having to be subservient. Watching the exciting scenes in the video, the fighting spirit inherited from the Chinese people over thousands of years seems to be awakening. Chapter 40. A new round of arms race on Earth. On the international internet, foreign nizens were also completely shocked and dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Sakura Kingdom Forum. The previous post claiming that the great SEA kingdom was militaristic disappeared instantly. Instead, it was various posts questioning the issue. Baka, those Indians are lying to us again. Definitely, this isn&#x27;t the first time India has done this.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. The Great Sa Kingdom has even mass-produced lightsabers. Will they come after us for revenge? It&#x27;s fake. It must be fake. The video was definitely created and spliced together using AI.</p>
<p>Many nitizens in Japan don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s true. It was clear that the lightsaber had a tremendous impact on them. On the other side, South Korean online military forums have also completely changed. The Great Sa Kingdom has stolen technology from our South Korean kingdom again. Lightsaber technology belongs to our South Korean country.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom must return it or we will sue you in the International Court of Justice. The Koreans are still the same as always. Everything good is supposedly invented by South Korea. Even in their eyes, South Korea is the center of the blue planet, the center of the solar system, and the center of the universe. The fact that they can be brainwashed like this shows how terrifying their country&#x27;s brainwashing education is.</p>
<p>I suspect they&#x27;ve been brainwashed since birth. American nizens remain silent. What they saw was the great SEA Kingdom has completely surpassed their eagle country in the field of laser technology. Not long ago, the Global Hawk drone was shot down by a laser weapon from the Great Sea Kingdom. Now, we see scenes of lightsaber combat.</p>
<p>Every single one of them proves it. China has already taken a significant lead over the United States in the field of laser weapons. They posted messages tagging the American government. We hope the government can catch up with the great Sia Kingdom in the field of laser weapons as soon as possible. Eagle, because of the time difference, it was already night.</p>
<p>Despite this, the lights in the White House in the Oval Office were on. In the office, President Otto looked at the video announcement released by the great Xiaom military with a serious expression. I watched it over and over again. The more you look at him, the more fascinating his expressions become. From the initial skepticism, the shock that followed.</p>
<p>And then, in the end, it was unbelievable. Dashia has really developed a lightsaber. He could not accept this result. After all, the United States has always touted itself as the world&#x27;s leader in technology and military. However, in the crucial field of laser weapons, it has now fallen far behind the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>How can the US remain the dominant power on Earth after that? Suddenly, OTP turned his head and stared intently at Defense Secretary Pete. Doesn&#x27;t your military have anything to explain? Pete frowned slightly and slowly explained. We do not have specific information yet, but judging from the video and the reaction of the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s military, the laser sword is definitely real. The specific technical details of how this is achieved are already being analyzed by relevant technical experts as how it is in the United States. The position of the Secretary of Defense is not entirely under the control of the president.</p>
<p>Sometimes even the president has to consider the military&#x27;s feelings. Otep barely containing his anger glared at Pete and warned. I hope you can get the results as soon as possible. I don&#x27;t want us to fall too far behind in the field of lasers. If Great Sia can do it, then we the eagle can definitely do it too.</p>
<p>Peter nodded in response, then left directly. Otep was so angry he wanted to grind his teeth. But there was nothing they could do. He does not have the authority to dismiss the defense minister. Now he only hopes that the military can produce results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the US will fall behind again. However, he had another way. It&#x27;s when the great Sia Kingdom can no longer withstand the sanctions on arrow engines and comes to them for negotiations. They proposed using laser weapon technology as a condition for lifting sanctions. In this way, the US can obtain the most advanced laser weapon technology for free.</p>
<p>The more OTP thought about it, the more he felt that this plan was feasible. It&#x27;s not just the US. European countries also held emergency military seminars because of the lightsaber issue. They have all begun discussing the establishment of new laser weapon research and development projects just because of a video. All developed countries on earth have begun a new round of arms race.</p>
<p>Everyone believed that if the great sea kingdom could do it, they could too. Nobody wants to admit it. Their research and development capabilities are inferior to those of the great SIA kingdom and the Middle East. Directly wielding their financial power, crown princes from several countries flew to great sa overnight on private jets. There&#x27;s only one goal to buy bye-bye.</p>
<p>At the same time, after seeing the video released by the great Sia Kingdom, the Indian kingdom, Indian nizens instantly felt like the sky had fallen. this must be fake. I don&#x27;t believe it. Why would the government lie to us? But that&#x27;s a video officially released by the great sea kingdom. It can&#x27;t be fake.</p>
<p>Then there&#x27;s only one possibility. Old immortal demo is deceiving us. The video went viral. The fate of India began with disbelief. Later they gradually descended into panic and chaos because the credibility of the great Sia kingdom&#x27;s official government is significantly higher than that of the Indian government.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Indian government only released photos and interview videos of the wounded. There is no video footage of the incident. Moreover, this applies to both personnel and wounds. They all match perfectly, even if they don&#x27;t want to believe it. We must all accept this cruel reality.</p>
<p>People who previously took to the streets holding banners that read Dasha must pay compensation. Now, they&#x27;ve all flocked to the gates of the Indian government and are shouting, &quot;You fraudster, demo the immortal. Give me an explanation.&quot; W not only have our soldiers suffered heavy losses, but the government actually lied to us. How despicable, old immortal demo, why are you hiding the truth? Why are you deceiving us into supporting the war? We&#x27;ve been made fools of. We thought we were heroes, but we&#x27;re invaders.</p>
<p>Raj must die. The great Sa Kingdom possesses laser swords. Why provoke them? In a short time, it&#x27;s blooming all over India. The Indians were originally indignant. Now, all the blame is being directed at the Indian government.</p>
<p>They demanded an explanation from the government. At the same time, the capital of India, New Delhi central square before the great SIA kingdom issued its announcement. Demo Laosen was standing on a high platform live streaming the awarding of medals to the wounded Indian soldiers. He was wearing a sharp white suit. He wore a gold medal on his chest and his smile was smug and arrogant.</p>
<p>Shout into the live stream camera. India needs heroes like you to resist the invasion of the great Sia Kingdom. You are the best. I hereby announce that each wounded soldier will be rewarded with 100,000 rupees. A reward of 500,000 rupees will be given to the families of the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>We will avenge you. The audience was packed with Indians. They held up banners that read, &quot;Dashiam must apologize and blood debts must be repaid in blood.&quot; They shouted slogans and were in high spirits. Sudden someone in the crowd screamed, &quot;Fuck everyone. Look at your phones.&quot; The great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s military has released a video moment.</p>
<p>This loud shout. This prompted the local Indians to curiously take out their phones. When they see the content of the video, they all stood there stunned. In the picture, the footage of Indian soldiers crossing the border, company commander Xiao&#x27;s warning, the buzzing of the lightsaber, the agitant screams. Every single frame, it was like a slap in the face to the people of India.</p>
<p>In the square, there was complete silence for 3 seconds. Then an angry roar exploded. Liar. Demo the immortal is a liar. We&#x27;ve been tricked.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t the great Sia invading at all. We crossed the border and caused trouble first. Give us our money back. You&#x27;ve deceived us with lies. Where is Raj? Make him come out.</p>
<p>He must be shot. Down with the deceitful government. We don&#x27;t want war. We want the truth. Chapter 41.</p>
<p>Demo. The immortal spits blood. The crowd rushed toward the platform like madmen. The banner was torn to shreds and the flowers were thrown on the ground and trampled to pieces. They only had one idea.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about defeating the old god Demo who deceived them. Defeat those were criminals who deceived them on stage. Demo the immortals previously wide watermelon slice like smile vanished instantly. Instead, they were completely bewildered. Soon his face went from bewildered to ashen.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on? Why have these lowly people suddenly gone mad? He took two steps back and yelled at the bodyguard. Stop them. Stop these lowly people. Anyone who dares to rush forward, shoot them. At this moment, old immortal demo was still unaware of what was happening.</p>
<p>But we absolutely cannot let those people rush onto the stage. The bodyguards pointed their guns at the crowd, but they dared not actually fire because the crowd was already angry enough. If they fire any more shots to provoke the situation, it will likely turn into a tragedy and then no one will be able to escape. In the awarding ceremony, Raj and his agitant saw the angry slogans shouted by the Indian boy in the square below. Raj and his agitant were they knew instantly that their scheme had been exposed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. I&#x27;m definitely going to die this time. Why did the great Sia Kingdom release the video this time? Why? Raj&#x27;s face was ashen and he kept muttering to himself. According to his preset plan, the Great Sa Kingdom will likely not issue a response just as it has before. In this way, no matter how they fabricate stories.</p>
<p>Ultimately, no one will ever know. But this time, the great Sia Kingdom not only responded publicly. A video of the scene was also attached. On the contrary, the agitant looked at Raj with eyes that seemed to want to devour him. Suddenly, disregarding his crippled hands, he shouted, &quot;It&#x27;s all your fault.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve made us a disgrace to the nation. You&#x27;ve made us sinners die. The agitant shouted as he rammed his head against the stunned Raji. Raj was knocked down instantly. The other soldiers rushed over and unleashed a barrage of attacks on Raj.</p>
<p>Those without hands used their feet. Even those with crippled hands and feet rolled over and bit with their teeth. They only had one idea. Raj must die. If it weren&#x27;t for Raj, they wouldn&#x27;t be in such a terrible situation.</p>
<p>They will not become sinners against India. on the other side. Just as DMA was about to ask something, his secretary stumbled onto the stage, her face filled with panic, her voice trembling. Prime Minister, the great Sia Kingdom has replied. It even comes with a video.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Raj is lying. We crossed the line first. What? Demo the immortal took the phone and looked at it. Then everything went black. He looked at the angry faces below the stage.</p>
<p>Hearing shouts of demo the immortal is a fraud. He recalled his earlier smuggness and promises. Thinking about the international ridicule right now, he couldn&#x27;t catch his breath and fell straight backward. With a thud, it crashed heavily onto the high platform. The secretary screamed, &quot;Prime Minister!&quot; The prime minister has fainted.</p>
<p>&quot;Call an ambulance immediately.&quot; The surrounding officials hurriedly made calls for ambulances. At the same time, high-ranking military officials began calling on local police and troops to suppress the rioting crowds. Bodyguards and security personnel surrounded Demo Laosen and other high-ranking Indian officials. Avoid being hurt by those angry Indians. The angry crowd saw that Demo had fainted and that there were armed men guarding him.</p>
<p>They no longer charged at them. They turned and rushed toward the podium where Logi was receiving his medal. The angry crowd overturned the awarding platform and trampled the medals. The scene was extremely chaotic. Those wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>They were all brutally beaten by the angry mob. Raj was beaten to death. Even the agitants were the same. For them, death can be considered a kind of liberation. At this moment, security personnel and the military have arrived.</p>
<p>They began to suppress the rioting Indians. They were facing a fully armed army and security personnel. The long suppressed anger did not dissipate with the arrival of the army and security personnel. Instead, it burned even more fiercely like drywood meeting a raging fire. This ultimately led to a serious bloodshed.</p>
<p>As for Demo the Immortal, it has already been secretly moved away. In this scene, it happened to be broadcast live. The footage quickly spread throughout India. Good riddance. That damn demo has made us a laughingstock all over the world.</p>
<p>Old immortal demo. Don&#x27;t think you can escape by fainting. You have to give us an explanation. That bastard deserved to die. It&#x27;s this kind of pest that makes us a laughingtock on earth.</p>
<p>The entire Indian empire. No one cared whether Demo the immortal lived or died after he fainted. They just want to know the truth. I don&#x27;t want to become a laughingtock in the world. Indians already have a bad reputation internationally.</p>
<p>Now this kind of farcical incident has happened again. This further damaged their reputation. Even people from India living overseas. They all chose to stay indoors because India has already embarrassed itself on the international stage. On the international internet, nizens saw that live stream footage.</p>
<p>It instantly became a sensation. A flood of sarcastic and mocking comments poured in. Haha. India has dug a huge hole for itself. Demo Laosen has become an international laughing stock.</p>
<p>Look at this chaotic scene. They deserve it. With this level of skill, you think you can get compensation from the great sea kingdom? Ridiculous. I saw riots in the capital of India. International nizens showed no pity whatsoever.</p>
<p>Everyone started watching the drama unfold. The more chaotic India becomes, the happier they are. Siaki Yuan Li Jian Guo was scrolling through the news, grinning from ear to ear. Haha. Old immortal demo is so angry he&#x27;s fainted.</p>
<p>This is truly gratifying. Lynchin put down the tablet, his face calm. Oldly, this is just the beginning. We will have even more advanced weapons and equipment in the future. By then, no country on the entire planet Earth will dare to provoke our great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Even the US won&#x27;t do. Lie Jian Guo heard Lynchs firm and confident tone. My heart is filled with joy. He looked at Lynch and exclaimed in admiration. You&#x27;re right, Kobayashi.</p>
<p>Our great Sa Kingdom has been silent for too long. It&#x27;s time to unshath our swords. Moreover, with you here, I believe that the technological development of our great Sia Kingdom will definitely make great strides. I don&#x27;t know why. Lie Jian Guo trusted Lynn Chun unconditionally.</p>
<p>The words Lynch spoke. He believes that it will definitely come true in the near future. Lynch nodded, &quot;Yes, it won&#x27;t take too long.&quot; On the other side, southwestern border, Commander Wong looked at the news on his phone, grinning from ear to ear. In the news video, the chaos at the Indian Square continues. As Demo was being lifted into the ambulance, people were still chasing after the vehicle, shouting, &quot;Liar!&quot; &quot;Sonia, you finally met your match.</p>
<p>I hope you will remember this lesson. Otherwise, next time it won&#x27;t be so simple.&quot; Commander Wongs eyes were filled with a sharp glint. The army group headquarters has already conveyed the instructions to him. From now on, as long as Indian soldiers dare to cross the border, we will handle it in the same way as this time. No survivors need to be left.</p>
<p>This is evident. The military of the great Sea Kingdom has also completely unleashed its power. It&#x27;s not like it used to be. Commander Wong even harbored a slight hope that India would cross the border again. In this way, his regiment and his soldiers can achieve merit again.</p>
<p>Prime Minister&#x27;s office of the three Arab countries. Demo the immortal has been revived, but his face remained pale. By this time, he had a clear understanding of the whole incident. His eyes were filled with nothing but anger. The anger of being deceived by subordinates again.</p>
<p>Some were also mocked and angered by the military of the Great Sa Kingdom. Great Sia Kingdom, you just wait. If I don&#x27;t avenge this, I swear I will never be a true Indian. Demo the immortal was in a fit of impotent rage. Then he picked up the phone and dialed the number of the American president.</p>
<p>Chapter 42. Are they going to launch the Southern Sky Project? The moment the call connected, Dimmo the immortal composed himself. His tone was calm and composed. President Aep, you must already know what happened on our border. There is only one purpose for contacting you this time.</p>
<p>I agree to cooperate with you, the Eagles, against the great Sia Kingdom. Faced with Demo&#x27;s straightforward statement, President Otto smirked slightly on the other end of the phone. He had been waiting for this day for a long time, but he pretended to be concerned. Oh my friend, I deeply sympathize with your plight. The great Sa Kingdom is indeed too arrogant.</p>
<p>How would you like to collaborate? Demo the immortal pretended to be serious and said, &quot;Our India is willing to completely side with you, the US. Let&#x27;s join forces to punish Great Sia. But I have one request. Once you acquire the laser weapon technology from Great Sa, you must share it with me. Without technology, how can I help you restrain the Great Sa?&quot; He had his own plans in mind.</p>
<p>Once we get laser technology, he India established his own independent state. At that point, the US will be nothing. OTP knew perfectly well what was going on. But on the surface, he smiled heartily. No problem.</p>
<p>Allies should share. If we join forces and acquire the laser technology of the great Sia, we&#x27;ll share a portion with you. Then the two exchanged a few more compliments. Then the call ended at the agreed upon time for business negotiations. I hung up the phone.</p>
<p>OTP&#x27;s smile vanished instantly. Old immortal demo trying to make us the US look like suckers again. Want to share technology? Dream on. Once we&#x27;ve got to see tied down, well kick them away. Otep stared at the map of the great Sia kingdom on the screen, his eyes filled with malice.</p>
<p>Let old immortal demo cause trouble for great Sia first. It will be easier to acquire laser weapon technology when the great Sia kingdom seeks negotiations. Otep was making his own plans. He knew, of course, that old immortal demo was not truly loyal to him. Has tricked the US before.</p>
<p>They always agreed readily. They&#x27;ll turn around and sell out the US. And it happened more than once. This time, we absolutely cannot let the old immortal succeed. The two old foxes each had their own ulterior motives.</p>
<p>They were all thinking about how to get the most benefit from each other. Time passed day by day. 5 days later, India has finally responded again. It is said that the border commander gave the order without authorization and all of them have been severely punished. They also guaranteed that similar incidents would not happen again.</p>
<p>The building is located in the border conflict between India and Argentina. That concludes this phase. However, India and the United States have publicly signed a series of military and commercial cooperation agreements. There has been much speculation from the outside world. India and the United States.</p>
<p>Those two old scoundrels are definitely plotting something bad again. On the other side, Siakiuan in the materials laboratory. All the engineers were filled with excitement as they looked at the data on the test screen. Is this really the alloy material we developed? Wow, this hardness is incredible. If it were used on a tank, wouldn&#x27;t it be invincible? No.</p>
<p>I think if we used it on fighter jets, our fighter jets could be even faster. I feel like I&#x27;m going crazy. These numbers are absolutely incredible. Each data point is examined. They couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim and cheer.</p>
<p>Lynn Shun and Lie Jian Guo stood to the side, their eyes filled with excitement. On the test screen, there are sets of precise data. All of this proves the terrifying performance of the new alloy material. Academician Xha Ming kept his eyes glued to the data on the screen. He turned to look at Lin Shun, his voice choked with emotion.</p>
<p>Chief engineer Lynn, we succeeded. All the data meets the design requirements and even exceeds them. Moreover, all indicators are more than 100 times higher than the most advanced aerospace materials currently available internationally, far ahead of other countries. Anyone who manufactures aircraft engines knows this. The main core materials for Arrow engines are divided into five parts.</p>
<p>First, there&#x27;s the turbine blades and turbine disc. Almost all of them use nickelbased single crystal alloys. Maximum temperature resistance 1,300° C. Tinsel strength 1,00 to,200 MPa. This is currently the most advanced material on Earth.</p>
<p>There are also ceramic matrix composite materials used in the combustion chamber and turbine shroud rings. Its maximum temperature resistance is only 1,650° C, and its tensil strength is only 300 to 400 MPa. Even the highest temperature resistant tailpipe and the afterburner use carbon carbon composite materials. Its maximum temperature resistance is only 2,600° C. Needless to say, its tinsel strength is only 200 to 300 MPa.</p>
<p>The compressor blades used later are made of titanium aluminum alloy which can withstand high temperatures of 900° C. The outer bypass casing uses a resin-based composite material that can withstand high temperatures of 300° C. Lynshin&#x27;s new alloy has a maximum temperature resistance of 300,000° C. It is 130 times more heatresistant than the highest temperature resistant carbon carbon composite material. Crucially, it weighs only 1% of the lightest material resin based composite materials.</p>
<p>Its tensil strength is 100 times that of the highest resin based composite material which has a tensil strength of 2,000 MPa. It reached a terrifying 200,000 MPa. Crucially, it can maintain its performance without degradation or deformationation even at high temperatures. This shows just how terrifying the parameters of this new alloy are. With it the mechanical components of an aircraft engine, all needs can be met using just this one material.</p>
<p>Only this kind of material exists. Only then can the terrifying high temperatures generated by the instantaneous electrolysis of air in a plasma engine be met. Lynchin picked up an alloy sample. The silver surface has a cool sheen and it feels very light in the hand. You can&#x27;t even feel that you&#x27;re holding something.</p>
<p>Is this really the new alloy material we created? Lie Jang Wo looked at the piece of alloy in Lynch&#x27;s hand and asked incredulously. Lynch nodded slightly. Okay. With this material, our aero engine industry no longer has to worry about material issues. Lie Jang Wos eyes instantly reened and he was extremely excited.</p>
<p>This is hardly a breakthrough of the US sanctions and blockade. It&#x27;s clearly a leap into a completely new era of materials science and technology. Once this material is available, who would still use those garbage materials from abroad? If you throw it to a dog, it won&#x27;t even glance at it. Not just aircraft engines. This material can be used for future matchs, space fighters, space carriers, spaceships, and space cities.</p>
<p>In the near future, there will be even more powerful materials. Lynch&#x27;s eyes were full of confidence. He wasn&#x27;t exaggerating. This material, although it is only a material technology inherent in plasma engines, but it can perfectly meet the needs of building space fighters, space carriers, space cities, and the like. The words had barely left his mouth.</p>
<p>The surrounding engineers instantly erupted in excitement. What? They can even build space fighters. They can even build space carriers. What the hell? They&#x27;re even bringing out space cities. Could it be that Chief Engineer Lynn is really planning to build the South Heavenly Gate? Lie Jang Wos eyes shone brightly, his voice trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>Xan, can you actually create all those names you mentioned earlier? If someone else brings it up, Li Jang Wo will probably just laugh it off. Although the South Heavenly Gate project has always existed in science fiction, but that&#x27;s just a fictional setting to attract attention and stimulate imagination. For at least 30 years, the Great Sa Kingdom will not be able to reach that level of technology. But now it&#x27;s coming out of Lynch&#x27;s mouth. It&#x27;s a completely different matter because everything Lynch mentioned has already come true.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Lyn Shan with anticipation. We await his reply. Chapter 43. G8 meeting. Joint military exercises.</p>
<p>Lynchin gently put down the alloy sample in his hand. Lynchin glanced at the expectant crowd and slowly nodded. Abel, this one word. It was like a thunderclap. The laboratory instantly erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>Really? That&#x27;s great. Chief designer Lynn is awesome. I want to participate in the Mecca project. Is the South Heavenly Gate project really going to be implemented? Hopefully, we can participate in the Nanchiman project at that time. The engineers hugged each other in excitement.</p>
<p>Everyone was filled with excitement. Mets, space fighters, space carrier. What man could resist such temptation? If I could personally participate in the research and development, they are willing to endure any hardship or fatigue. Lie Jian Guo was utterly shocked, his voice trembling. Shaolin, how long will it take before we can begin? At most 6 months.</p>
<p>The South Heavenly Gate project should be ready to begin. Linshins tone was calm yet carried an unwavering force. Well, Li Jang Wo said good twice. But that&#x27;s enough to express his excitement at that moment. 6 months.</p>
<p>He can wait. He should be able to live to see the day when the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s South Heavenly Gate project is completed. Lynchin will definitely not let him down. Perhaps the timeline could even be brought forward. Lynch nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>Excitement aside, we still need to get things done. He turned to the engineers and shouted. All right, that&#x27;s all for 6 months from now. Now, our top priority is to develop a gravity plasma engine. Next, we will begin processing the parts.</p>
<p>We need to process the components for the first anti-gravity plasma engine as soon as possible. Receive. The engineers immediately composed themselves. His gaze became even more determined. The engineers began to devote themselves fully to their work.</p>
<p>Lynch and watched for a while. Let&#x27;s go back to Li Jang Wos office first because Lynshin had other ideas about this material. Lie Jang Wos office. Lynshin sat on the sofa and got straight to the point. Mr.</p>
<p>Lee, I have an idea. Let&#x27;s modify the parameters of this new material and apply it to civilian use. Civilian use? Lie Jian Guo was taken aback for a moment. Then his eyes lit up. You have an idea? Yes.</p>
<p>Lynch and nodded. Like cars using a new type of alloy for the frame. The weight is only 1% of the current weight and the hardness is sufficient to effectively ensure the safety of the people on board. With the addition of a super solid state battery, the range can reach 5,000 km and it can be fully charged in 5 minutes. Safe, durable, and inexpensive.</p>
<p>Ordinary people definitely need it. Li Jian Guo slapped his thigh. Great idea. Let&#x27;s look for those purely domestic car manufacturers. No foreign ownership.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded and continued to offer suggestions. Prices must be brought down. The cost of alloys is already low and the cost of batteries is also low. A more affordable model would cost around 50,000 yuan so that even salaried workers can afford it. As for the high-end models, let them decide for themselves.</p>
<p>Lynchin will not stop companies from producing high-end products. As long as it&#x27;s a product that benefits the general public and meets his standards, that&#x27;s fine. The rest is none of his business. No problem. I&#x27;ll have someone make the contact here.</p>
<p>But are you sure there won&#x27;t be any problems with mass production of the materials? Li Jang Guo was not worried about the car cooperation issue. The concern is whether mass production of materials can meet the demand. You need to know. China produces the most cars in the world every day. If the materials don&#x27;t keep up, everything is just empty talk.</p>
<p>Lynchin gave Li Jian Guo a reassuring look. oldly. As long as we have the process parameters, any steel mill in China can start production at any time. It&#x27;s not like we need some rare raw material, that&#x27;s good, Li Jang Wo nodded. As long as there are no problems with the raw materials, given the domestic processing capabilities, mass production is a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Although car batteries have already begun mass production, but automakers want to adapt. Everything has to be started all over again. Perfect timing. We can use the new alloy. Lie Jian Guo looked at Lin Shan with eyes full of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Shaolin, you not only do scientific research, but you also think about the people. They&#x27;ve considered things more thoroughly than we old folks. Lynshan smiled and said, &quot;The purpose of science and technology is to make the country stronger and the people live a better life.&quot; &quot;Well said,&quot; Lie Jian Guo clapped his hands in praise. Lynchs ideological awareness is higher than theirs. Then, Lynch gave a few more instructions.</p>
<p>Then I went back to the lab. Lie Jian Guo also notified Shingchin Technology, a new company established by the state specifically for Lin Shan. Have them write out a detailed plan and find a suitable company to cooperate with. On the other side, the White House of the USP&#x27;s face was terribly grim. so much time has passed.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#x27;t the great SI Kingdom approached us for negotiations yet? Have they made another breakthrough in the aviation field? He was still making plans in his mind. When the Great Sa Kingdom comes knocking, we&#x27;ll definitely squeeze them for a hefty sum. We need to acquire not only laser weapon technology, we even need to bring back quantum lithography technology. Result: Waiting on the left, waiting on the right. Didn&#x27;t see any contact from the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>Not only was there no contact, but they even suspended all space related projects. Such a large number of projects were shut down. It would be difficult for them not to receive the news. Impossible. Secretary of State Raymond shook his head.</p>
<p>How could they break through without our aerospace materials and they develop it themselves? The more OTP thought about it, the more likely it seemed. No, we can&#x27;t wait any longer. We must put pressure on the great Sea Kingdom. With this in mind, OTP gave the order immediately. Go and notify our allies that we will have an online meeting in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Okay. The president&#x27;s secretary hurriedly went out to make arrangements. Lay Manguo asked curiously. President, are you planning to put pressure on the great SEA Kingdom like this? A sinister glint appeared in OTP&#x27;s eyes. Joint military exercises.</p>
<p>An hour later, the online meeting has officially begun. Prime Minister of Japan, President of South Korea, Prime Minister of Australia, French, etc. Even the old immortal demo got involved. The heads of state of eight countries are all online. They were all waiting for OTP to speak.</p>
<p>OTP glanced at the crowd and slowly began to speak. There is only one purpose for this meeting to suppress the arrogance of the great SA kingdom. Therefore, I suggest that this year&#x27;s joint military exercises begin in a month. The location will be in the South China Sea. Japanese Prime Minister Jiro Kishida nodded quickly.</p>
<p>We fully support you. South Korean President Park Quac echoed. We will send all our warships. Prime Minister of Australia. Support.</p>
<p>European nations. We support it too. India&#x27;s demo the immortal. Our India has dispatched two aircraft carrier fleets. The words had barely left his mouth.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Demo the immortal. Recalling the unpleasant incident that had occurred between him and the Great Sa Kingdom, he instantly understood their intention. Ot nodded in satisfaction as he watched their fawning expressions. Very good. This time we must make the great Sia understand that there is no good end for those who oppose us.</p>
<p>A sinister glint flashed in his eyes. The laser weapons and quantum chips of the great Sia dynasty kept him up at night. He must achieve the results he wants from this military exercise. The meeting has ended. All the countries went back to arrange their warships.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US also publicly announced the joint military exercises. Chapter 44 laser cannons deployed on ship. The announcement of the joint military exercises by the US and the US was posted online. The world&#x27;s netizens are in an uproar. South Korean military forms erupted in chaos.</p>
<p>Damn it. This is the happiest news I&#x27;ve seen all year. Our King Sajong s warship is the best in Asia. This time we&#x27;ll show Great Sea what we&#x27;re made of. We&#x27;re just waiting for the Great Sia Kingdom to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Japanese nizens are even more arrogant. Yoshi, the South China Sea is America&#x27;s backyard. If Great Sia dares to resist, it&#x27;s courting death. Last time the lightsaber was luck. This time with an eight- nation coalition.</p>
<p>What will they use to stop it? I suggest we blockade the ports of the Great Sia Kingdom. American nizens panicked. Are you really going to fight Great Sea? They can even shoot down a global hawk. With laser weapons being so powerful, are our warships safe? President Otto swear, don&#x27;t mess around. What if you lose? Netzens from Dondai University were furious and started cursing.</p>
<p>An eight nation coalition. Do you really think this is still 100 years ago? The US is all about forming clicks. Let&#x27;s see if they can handle a one-on-one fight. Just you wait. Anyone who dares to trespass into our great SEA will be annihilated.</p>
<p>Indian nizens are in an uproar. They all hope that the great SA kingdom would pay the price. Some people took screenshots and forwarded them while others spread the word far and wide. On the international internet, it&#x27;s as noisy as a vegetable market. On the other side, Pingua company headquarters.</p>
<p>Cook slammed his phone on the table. The screen shattered into a spiderweb pattern. He stared at the sales report, his face as black as the bottom of a pot. Sales in the great Seia Kingdom market have plummeted for four consecutive weeks. They sold 300 units in a whole month.</p>
<p>Huawei, on the other hand, sold 5 million units in its initial sales. In the past month, another 30 million units have been sold. Their sales in one month are almost equal to their sales in the previous 6 months. Even other mobile phone manufacturers have seen their sales plummet. It was dominated by Warwick.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they have overseas markets to support them, but it was only temporary. Huawei is still ramping up its production capacity. Chip production capacity is also increasing. After the needs of the people of the great Sia Kingdom are met, it will definitely return to the international market. That will be the time when their fruit business goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>Just then, the office door was kicked open. The shareholders rushed in, their faces increasingly grim. Cook, where&#x27;s the quantum chip you bought? 50 billion. More than a month has passed, and there&#x27;s still no sign of a quantum chip. If you don&#x27;t get the chips, you&#x27;re out of Pingua company.</p>
<p>Cook&#x27;s face was grim, and his voice trembled. I&#x27;ve been urging to see everyday. And the response is always the same. Insufficient production capacity. We need to wait.</p>
<p>Then go to the White House. A shareholder slammed his fist on the table in frustration. Isn&#x27;t President OTP on good terms with you? Get him to put pressure on you. Okay, I&#x27;ll give it a try. Cook grabbed the phone and dialed OTP&#x27;s number.</p>
<p>The call was answered very quickly. President OP, there&#x27;s something I need your help with. Here&#x27;s what happened. There was a 2-cond silence on the other end of the phone, followed by a cold laugh. Cook Pinga is doing great.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve imposed joint sanctions on chip manufacturing, and you&#x27;re going to buy chips from the Great Sa Kingdom. You still want me to help you expedite the delivery of Da&#x27;s goods? Just wait for the FBI to come knocking. Snap. The call was immediately disconnected. Is it over? Cook only realized it at this moment.</p>
<p>They had originally planned to secretly go to the great Sea Kingdom. This already violates the US ban. Isn&#x27;t this just walking into the line of fire? Cook slumped in his chair. Cold sweat streamed down my neck. He suddenly understood.</p>
<p>Pingua. This time, Pengua may really be finished. The other shareholders also heard what happened. Quietly left Cook&#x27;s office. At the same time, they were also planning to sell their shares in the fruit company as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Although it has been falling for a month, but we&#x27;ll try to salvage as much as we can. It&#x27;s better than going bankrupt. Pengua company is just a microcosm. Many semiconductor companies have suffered severe business losses due to the quantum chips from the great SEA Kingdom. A large number of products are piling up in the warehouse.</p>
<p>There were no buyers at all. Everyone is watching and waiting. We await the improvement of China&#x27;s domestic production capacity and exports. Nobody&#x27;s stupid. At times like these, nobody wants to use chips that are so outdated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many semiconductor companies. We are also hoping that this exercise by the eight nation alliance of the United States will put pressure on the great sea kingdom find a breakthrough in the negotiations. This forced the great sea kingdom to make concessions on ship exports. Otherwise, they&#x27;re really finished. The military department of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>A meeting is in progress. H the US is going to start joint military exercises again. Do they still think we&#x27;re the great sea of the past? You think you can use this method to threaten us into compromising? Dream on. General spoke first, his tone filled with disdain. The commanding officer spoke up.</p>
<p>Old Jeang, has the deployment of the laser cannons on the ship been completed? General Jeang nodded, his voice excited. Yes, it&#x27;s done and we&#x27;re preparing to test it. The words had barely left his mouth. The meeting room erupted in excitement. It&#x27;s finished so quickly.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s great. Test it now. Once the test is successful, we can use the US combined fleet as practice targets. All the generals became excited, their eyes gleaming with anticipation. They already knew the power of the laser cannon, especially after the last border incident between India and India.</p>
<p>Almost all the generals already knew the power of the super laser weapon. It is a terrifying force capable of instantly penetrating thick armor and obliterating advanced enemy fighters, tanks, and warships. Now, laser cannons are on board. This will undoubtedly greatly enhance the Navy&#x27;s combat capabilities. Has the test location been chosen? The commander in charge suppressed the excitement of the crowd.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve already chosen it right here in the South China Sea. Xiao Tiani, commander of the GuangDong military region, replied smugly. Xiao, you&#x27;re just showing off. If you hadn&#x27;t gotten there first, our East China Sea fleet would definitely have been the first to be equipped this time, said Xiao Xi Hao, commander of the Eastern Theater Command, unconvinced. Exactly.</p>
<p>Still showing off. We should first develop our army&#x27;s vehicle-mounted mobile laser weapon. Your army at least has lightsabers, but our air force is the worst off. I heard they&#x27;ve been developing a new aero engine specifically for you and you&#x27;ll soon have new fighter jets. Why are you still complaining here? In a short time, Xiao Tiani, commander of the southern GuangDong military region, became the target of public criticism when news of the super laser cannon came out.</p>
<p>The major military regions immediately rushed to equip themselves with these items. In the end, the southern Guangdong military region beat them to it. Originally, other military regions already had some complaints. Now look at Xiao Tiani s smug expression. How could they possibly hold back? Only General Xiao and the commander in charge remained silent.</p>
<p>They were already used to this kind of situation. A moment later, the general in the lead gestured for them to be quiet. Then he slowly opened his mouth. All right, now that the laser cannon has been successfully installed on the ship, then let&#x27;s get the testing going. No problem.</p>
<p>Equip the entire army with it. Arm all our naval warships to the teeth. strive to complete the refitting of most mainstream warships within one month. Then we&#x27;ll give the US-led coalition a big surprise. It&#x27;s time for our great SIA to unshave its sword.</p>
<p>Chapter 45. You call a 1,500 km range a naval gun. The military meeting has concluded. There was also another decision to be made. It means inviting Lin Shan and Lie Jian Guo to the site to participate in the test.</p>
<p>Syaki Yuan Linshans office. As soon as Li Jian Guo entered the office, he sat down, took a sip of tea, and then began to speak. Shaolin, the military has invited you to participate in the test of the shiporn superpowered laser cannon. I wonder if you can find the time. The laser cannon has already been installed on the ship.</p>
<p>Lynchin was a little surprised. The military is moving a bit too fast. Lie Jiango nodded. The modifications are indeed complete. Well be testing it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can you spare the time? Sure. Lynshin smiled and agreed. It&#x27;s a good opportunity to take a look at our great Seia Kingdoms warships. Anti-gravity plasma engine is on track. Basically, all the technical issues have been resolved.</p>
<p>The rest is to process the parts and then assemble the first prototype. He has plenty of time now. Okay, then I&#x27;ll have the military pick us up tomorrow. After finishing his sentence, Lie Jiano drank the rest of the tea in his cup and left. Lynchin sat in his office and began to ponder.</p>
<p>Laser cannons have been deployed on the ship. Those joint military exercises organized by the US will get interesting. Hopefully, you Americans won&#x27;t make a mistake. Otherwise, this time I will definitely let you experience the power of the super laser cannon. The power of the superpowered laser cannon.</p>
<p>Lynchin was still very confident. This laser weapon can be fired directly at sea. It will not be affected by harsh environments such as water vapor and sunlight refraction. As long as it&#x27;s within range, both can effectively hit the target. It caused serious damage to the target.</p>
<p>Moreover, the shiporn superpowered laser cannon has been upgraded. It is 10 times more powerful than a vehicle- mounted laser cannon. Because shipbor laser cannons can carry larger super solid state magnetic field batteries, it&#x27;s easy to penetrate the deck of a warship. Lynn Shon, on the contrary, hoped that this joint military exercise with the US would be the same as before. The more arrogant the better, and it would be best if they crossed the line again.</p>
<p>Give the Navy a chance to fight a real battle. The next day, 8:00 in the morning, a military airport in Beijing. A military aircraft was parked there. Lin Shun, Li Jang Guo, and General Jeang were already seated in the military aircraft. 3 hours later, military aircraft landed at the South China Sea Naval District airfield.</p>
<p>Lin Shun Li Jian Guo and others got off the plane. Ziao Tiani, commander of the southern Guangdong military region, was greeted at the airport by several officers. Old Jang Dean Lee, you finally arrived. Commander Xiao greeted them with a smile. Seeing Lin Chun beside the two, they immediately guessed his identity.</p>
<p>This is General Nodded. Just know it. Don&#x27;t say it out loud. Okay, I understand. Commander Xiao understood immediately.</p>
<p>He walked up to Lynn Shun and extended his hand to shake Linshins hand. Comrade Lynn, welcome. Welcome. Lynchin&#x27;s identity was something that people of his status had heard of, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen him in person. Unexpectedly, he was the chief designer of the super laser cannon.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s still so handsome and young. He couldn&#x27;t help but sigh inwardly. The younger generation is truly formidable. Commander Xiao, you&#x27;re too kind. Lynch shook hands politely and responded with a smile.</p>
<p>When does the test begin? Commander Xiao laughed and said, Comrade Shaolin, we are ready and waiting for you. Okay, let&#x27;s go to the test site. Lynch and nodded. Then, Commander Xiao then took Lynchin to a car. Lie Jian Guo and General Jeang were in the same car.</p>
<p>As for the other officers, seeing how enthusiastic Commander Xiao was towards Lin Shan, people began speculating about Lin Chin&#x27;s identity, who do you think that young man is? Why is the commander so enthusiastic? Could he have some special identity? Definitely. Otherwise, why would our commander, with his fiery temper, come all the way to pick us up at the airport? This young man&#x27;s identity is probably not simple. After several officers boarded the vehicle, they kept communicating in hush tones. Soon, the convoy then arrived at the South China Sea fleet naval port. On the sea outside the pier, 055 destroyer, like a giant steel whale, stood steadily there.</p>
<p>The gray hull gleamed with a cold light, and the towering mast pierced the blue sky. New turrets, super laser cannons, have been added to both the bow and stern of the ship. The sea was calm with only small waves lapping against the hull and splashing up tiny white foams. On deck, the naval soldiers stood ramrod straight, rifles in hand. The white military uniform was ironed without a single wrinkle, and the belt was tightly fastened.</p>
<p>Ziao Tiani led Lin Shun and the others onto the ship. Comrade Xan, what do you think of this ship modification? Do you like it? One missile each at the bow and stern. He pointed to the laser cannon and explained. Lynch nodded. Not bad.</p>
<p>This design is very suitable. All right, let&#x27;s start the test then. Commander Xiao was getting impatient. Then, Commander Xiao directly ordered the warships to leave port. Not long after, arrive at the designated test area.</p>
<p>Commander Xiao gave the order directly. Obey my orders. Prepare for laser cannon test firing. Target the buoy 50 km away. Hit destroy.</p>
<p>Target 100 km buoy. Hit. Destroy. Target 200 km. Target 300 km.</p>
<p>Hit. Destroy. Finally. Everyone on the warship erupted in cheers. The soldiers on deck cheered and jumped for joy, tears welling in their eyes.</p>
<p>Some even had a smug smile on their faces like they were playing the role of Wong Yus, a famous Chinese comedian. Ziao Tiani was so excited that he hugged General Xiao tightly. Old Xiao, we succeeded. Our fleet finally has a divine weapon. With sand in his eyes, Ziao Jian Jun exclaimed with emotion, &quot;Yes, we&#x27;ve finally waited for this day.&quot; After the initial excitement, Lynch watched them quietly, his heart filled with emotion.</p>
<p>This moment, he believes that all the engineers efforts were worthwhile. A second assessment of his previous choice, a nation strong in science and technology. Let technology become a solid bull work for safeguarding national security. After the initial excitement, Lynshin reminded, &quot;Commander Xiao, we need to continue testing. We haven&#x27;t reached the limit yet.&quot; &quot;Good target, 500 km buoy.&quot; Ziao Tiani excitedly gave the order.</p>
<p>His face was full of excitement. If it can hit the target accurately at a distance of 500 km, from then on, the warships of the great Sia Kingdom could roam freely and doineeringly throughout the entire blue star. The technician took a deep breath and pressed the button. This time the white light seems to be moving a little slower. It wasn&#x27;t that the cannon fire was slow.</p>
<p>It was that everyone was holding their breath. 2 seconds later, the 500 km buoy on the monitoring screen vaporized directly onto the sea surface, leaving not a single fragment behind. The data pops up. Decrease of 0.05%. H.</p>
<p>When Lie Jian Guo saw the data, he gasped in shock. Then he instantly became excited. We did it. We really did it. Haha.</p>
<p>Oh, that&#x27;s great. It can actually reach a range of 500 km. Comrade Xanin Danley, thank you for bringing such powerful weapons to our navy. With this, the navy of our great Sa Kingdom will truly rise. Ziao Tiani was as excited as a child.</p>
<p>The officers around him were so excited that their eyes turned red. They were all veterans of the navy. Naturally, they knew how difficult it had been for the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s Navy to get to where it is today. Previously, there were no good naval guns. In response to the US warships, an aircraft carrier invasion was launched.</p>
<p>They even moved tanks onto warships to use as naval guns. Visible. How backward was the Navy of the Great Sea Kingdom back then? That incident was an indelible pain in the history of the Great Sa Navy. Whenever this matter is mentioned, the veteran naval personnel cannot help but feel deeply moved. In recent years, the Navy of the Great Sea Kingdom has grown stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s far from enough. Even today, after installing the super laser cannon, the navy of the great Sia Kingdom has finally taken off. No country&#x27;s warships on the entire planet Earth can rival them. Even the US nuclearpowered aircraft carrier battle groups are no match. Looking at the excited Commander Xiao and his group, Lynshin suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>Commander Xiao, its range can actually reach 1,500 km. What? Commander Xiao exclaimed in shock. The range can reach 1,500 km. Wouldn&#x27;t that cover the entire South China Sea? Suddenly, Commander Xiaos eyes lit up as he thought of a fixed test target. Chapter 46.</p>
<p>The vanished, dilapitated warship. Even General was shocked. For air defense, being able to intercept targets at a range of 1,500 km is acceptable. But on the sea, if the range can reach 1,500 km, that&#x27;s a bit terrifying. That&#x27;s a bit against common sense.</p>
<p>But when I think of Lin Chin&#x27;s extraordinary talent, the doubts were instantly banished from his mind. After all, extraordinary beings cannot be measured by common sense. This is an unimaginable range capability. Perhaps it was the innovation and breakthrough brought about by Lynch. General Xang was secretly amazed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Commander Xiao, once the thought entered my mind, it grew stronger and stronger until I could no longer suppress it. He turned to look at Linshan and asked excitedly, &quot;Comrade Xiaoan, are you sure the laser cannon can reach a range of 1,500 km?&quot; Lynch nodded seriously and said confidently, &quot;Sure, as long as you have the accurate coordinates, that&#x27;s fine.&quot; &quot;Great,&quot; Commander Xiao exclaimed excitedly, slapping his thigh. &quot;Then let&#x27;s test it out. Let&#x27;s see if it really has a range of 1,500 km.&quot; The officer in charge of the target assessment immediately felt overwhelmed upon hearing this. He walked over to Commander Xiao and whispered a reminder.</p>
<p>Commander, the furthest target we prepared is only 500 km away. We didn&#x27;t prepare a target that could travel 1,500 km. You don&#x27;t need to prepare anything. Commander Xiao pointed to the location of an island or reef on the nautical chart. Isn&#x27;t there a ready-made target here? General Jeang took one look and exclaimed, &quot;Good heavens, Xiao, are you sure you&#x27;re not mistaken?&quot; The officer saw that location.</p>
<p>He was so shocked that he exclaimed, &quot;Commander, is this position really suitable as a target? Why not? Commander Xiao&#x27;s eyes were full of wisdom. I&#x27;ve wanted to deal with it for a long time. It&#x27;s just that there hasn&#x27;t been a good opportunity now. Our laser cannons are so powerful. Make it disappear when the time comes.&quot; In conclusion, Commander Xiao&#x27;s tone was full of authority and determination.</p>
<p>Lynchin listened to them exchanging coded messages. I was also curious to take a look at those coordinates. You know exactly where it is instantly. That wrecked ship. It&#x27;s like a thorn stuck in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Every time it&#x27;s mentioned, it makes the people of Dashia grit their teeth in hatred. But there was nothing they could do. There may have been various concerns in the past, but things are different now. The power of a laser cannon can make it disappear. Thinking about this, Lynn Shin spoke directly.</p>
<p>Commander Xiao, I agree to let you destroy it. Based on the location of the warship only about 1,000 km away from that wrecked warship. The range is more than sufficient. Destroy it. It can also make Chinese people happy.</p>
<p>Comrade Xan, you agree too? That&#x27;s great. Commander Xiao looked at Lin Shun with excitement and approval. General Jeang sighed helplessly. Shaolin Yu. He wanted to persuade them, but then thought better of it.</p>
<p>Lynchin is here. Even if something happens, it will eventually turn out to be nothing. Commander Xiao, let&#x27;s begin. We can fire continuously until the target disappears. Lynn Shan was getting impatient.</p>
<p>I want to see that wrecked warship disappear from this world. All right, I&#x27;ll give the order right now. Commander Xiao nodded. Then the orders were given. Testing continues.</p>
<p>Coordinates XXX location dilapitated warship. Fire continuously until the target is completely out of sight. Receive. The soldier is operated after receiving instructions. Upon seeing that location, I instantly became excited.</p>
<p>Almost all naval soldiers regarding that wrecked warship. They all wanted to destroy it. Now, finally, the opportunity has arrived. The soldiers were noticeably faster. Soon, coordinates successfully locked.</p>
<p>Then, the laser cannon began to charge. During the charging process, the soldier operating the device stared intently at the charging progress bar, his eyes filled with anticipation and excitement. Charging complete. The soldier can directly press the fire button. Moment, a dazzling laser beam shot out from the muzzle of the cannon.</p>
<p>Wherever the laser passes, the air is burned and distorted, leaving a long trail of light. At the same time, inside the dilapitated warship, several Filipino monkeys were laughing and chatting. When do you think our new supplies will arrive? If this continues, we&#x27;ll starve to death. A Filipino monkey with sunken eye sockets, just skin and bones. Clearly, their lives on the wrecked ship were not easy either.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the rush? We can catch seafood to eat. We won&#x27;t starve. Anyway, the Great Sa Kingdom can&#x27;t do anything to us. The other Filipino monkey looked on with disdain. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>This place originally belonged to our country. The great Sa forcibly occupied our territory and then slandered us. Anyway, we&#x27;d rather die then. The monkey hadn&#x27;t finished saying the word leave. A terrifying beam of light descended from the sky.</p>
<p>It struck the dilapidated warship with lightning speed. Boom! The laser beam pierced through the warship&#x27;s deck in an instant. Wherever it passed, metal melted and sparks flew. The monkey was hit by the laser and instantly vaporized. What happened? What just happened? Is this a punishment from heaven? No, I don&#x27;t want to die here.</p>
<p>A sudden and terrifying scene. This caused the other Filipino monkeys to scream in terror and scatter in all directions. Some even tried to call for help via satellite phone, but the laser cannons didn&#x27;t give them a chance at all. On the Type 055 destroyer, two laser cannons fired simultaneously. Moreover, it is continuous.</p>
<p>Boom. It&#x27;s almost one shot every 3 seconds. Each time, a large portion of the dilapidated warships disappeared. The Filipino monkey inside wasn&#x27;t directly hit and vaporized. It was hit by the collapsed structure of the warship or be struck by flying hot metal fragments.</p>
<p>They had nowhere to hide. Even if I wanted to jump into the sea, I couldn&#x27;t because it was only one minute. The entire wrecked warship simply vanished from the world. Even the sea water was evaporated. Only thick smoke remained.</p>
<p>This suggests that a provocative warship once stood here on the other side. The moment the dilapitated warship disappeared. Commander Xiao shouted excitedly. Good. Finally, I can vent my anger.</p>
<p>So many years have passed. I&#x27;ve always been disgusted by that dilapidated warship. Every time I see that wrecked warship in that spot. It&#x27;s like a thorn stuck in your heart, making you feel like you have a fishbone stuck in your throat. Now that this thorn has finally been removed, how can one not feel extremely relieved? General Jeang and his men were also filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Great. The thorn is finally gone. This feels so good. Finally, I don&#x27;t have to be disgusted anymore. This laser cannon is truly terrifying in its power.</p>
<p>It can be called a seauppressing artifact. General exclaimed, &quot;Let&#x27;s see who dares to swagger around our doorstep from now on.&quot; Lynchin also had a big smile on his face. Seeing Commander Xiao and his team&#x27;s excitement and enthusiasm filled me with a sense of accomplishment. Commander Xiao patted Lynch on the shoulder. Comrade Lynn, we did it.</p>
<p>The language is concise. Everything is understood without words. Yes. Lynshan nodded, a glint of shrewdness in his eyes. But this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>If the combined fleet of the US and China dares to cross the border a month from now, I hope Commander Xiao can blast him with his laser cannon. Chapter 47. The Philippines was terrified upon hearing this. Commander Xiao. He immediately admired Lin Chin even more.</p>
<p>I pat my chest and guarantee. Comrade Xan, don&#x27;t worry. Thanks to this amazing weapon you created for our navy. If the US-led fleet dares to cross the border, we will bomb them. That&#x27;s right, General Jeang echoed with a smile.</p>
<p>If the Americans dare to come, we dare to open fire. We used to talk about building a strong nation through science and technology. Today, he truly witnessed it. Faced with powerful technology, all threats are paper tigers, especially weapons that employ dimensional reduction attacks. It could be enough to overturn the course of a war.</p>
<p>There is also Lin Shin&#x27;s patriotism. This deeply moved the two generals. Unexpectedly, a young man like Lin Shan, their ideological awareness is even higher than theirs. Lie Jian Guo, who was standing to the side, adjusted his reading glasses, his eyes a little red. He didn&#x27;t say much, but patted Lin Chin&#x27;s back heavily.</p>
<p>But the approval in his eyes carried more weight than any words. Good lad, you didn&#x27;t disgrace our SA Science Institute. This dilapidated warship should have been dealt with long ago. Lynshin smiled and nodded, his gaze sweeping across the deck. Soldiers on the Type055 destroyer.</p>
<p>They were excitedly discussing the laser cannon. Their eyes gleamed as they stared at the laser cannon. Those shots just now were really exciting. I&#x27;m actually hoping that the US-led coalition will cause trouble again then. Absolutely.</p>
<p>With this laser cannon in hand, when they come, we&#x27;ll just blast them to smitherines. The soldiers voices were full of unfinished business. Everyone was looking forward to the next opportunity to fight. Command room. Commander Xiao.</p>
<p>The test is over. Well head back to the Xia Science Academy now. Lynchin glanced at the time, then turned and said the anti-gravity plasma engine. All right, you go ahead and get busy. Commander Xiao nodded quickly.</p>
<p>If you need any cooperation from our military region in the future, just let us know. He knew Lynchin was busy. There were no words of persuasion to keep them. I&#x27;ll take you back, General said with a smile. Then Lynchin said goodbye.</p>
<p>They left just as General Jeang and the others believed. At the same time, a certain area of the South China Sea, a fishing boat from the Philippines is secretly casting its nets. On deck, several Filipino fishermen, cigarettes dangling from their lips, chatted arrogantly. The Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s patrol ships probably won&#x27;t be coming today, right? What are you afraid of? The patrol boats of the great Sea Kingdom won&#x27;t come this far. Let&#x27;s catch more fish.</p>
<p>We can make a lot of money selling them back home. That&#x27;s right. This is our waters. It&#x27;s none of their business. A tall, thin fisherman.</p>
<p>He even made a provocative gesture towards the direction of the great sea kingdom. Their fishing nets have already yielded a considerable number of protected fish species. Sudden the tall, thin companion pointed into the distance, his voice trembling. Look over there. What&#x27;s that? Everyone looked in the direction he pointed.</p>
<p>Thick smoke billowed from the distant sea. Isn&#x27;t that the location of our country&#x27;s dilapitated warship? Someone recognized the location and panicked instantly. The dilapidated warship has been in the South China Sea for more than a decade. They had already memorized the coordinates. The tall, thin man quickly took out his phone and started recording in that direction.</p>
<p>In the shot, the wrecked warship that was originally in its location has disappeared. Only thick smoke remained floating on the sea. W. What happened? Why did it disappear? One of the fisherman&#x27;s legs buckled and he almost fell. It&#x27;s Dasha Kingdom.</p>
<p>It must have been done by the great Sia Kingdom. The tall thin manes voice trembled and his hand recording with his phone kept shaking. Run. We have to get out of here. Once someone realized what was happening, they didn&#x27;t even need the fishing nets anymore.</p>
<p>Quickly set sail and get away. All that arrogance from before has vanished. Everyone&#x27;s face was deafly pale. The fishing boat sped off towards the Philippines. The tall, thin man held his phone, his heart still pounding.</p>
<p>He felt a chill run down his spine as he watched the wrecked warship disappear in the video. If we had left a moment later, they&#x27;ll probably end up feeding the fish, too. That afternoon of the Philippines, officials from the fisheries department. He rushed into the office clutching his tablet. Mr.</p>
<p>President, something terrible has happened. Our dilapidated warships in the South China Sea are gone. President Moss is having lunch. Upon hearing this, he spat out a mouthful of rice. He jumped up and snatched the tablet.</p>
<p>What did you say? Say it again. The official pointed to the video. Look, this was filmed by fishermen. The location of the damaged warship is now just white smoke. The president stared at the video, his eyes widening.</p>
<p>All that&#x27;s left in the picture is thick smoke. But the broken warship had already disappeared. He looked at it three times, his hands beginning to tremble. Investigate. Investigate immediately.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see if it was done by the Great Sea Kingdom. The intelligence agencies launched an investigation as quickly as possible. Satellite images, fisherman&#x27;s testimonies, and even secretly monitored radio signals were all compiled together. A few hours later, the head of the intelligence department held the report. He walked into the presidential office with a solemn expression, &quot;President.&quot; No specific information was found, but we found that navigation is prohibited in a certain area of the South China Sea of the Great Sea Kingdom, which is 1,000 km away from the broken warship.</p>
<p>We suspect that the Great Sea Kingdom is testing some kind of naval weapon. Is it really the Great Sea Kingdom? The president&#x27;s face was terribly gloomy, although there is no direct evidence, but it is definitely related to the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s recent ban on navigation. Hateful. How dare the Great Sia Kingdom? Could it be that because the US is conducting joint military exercises, Great Sia wants to give the US a warning beforehand? But why target our Philippines? Little Mars was so angry that he paced around the office, his face turning ashen. Although the warship was old and dilapitated, but it is also a symbol of the Philippines in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Now it has been directly destroyed by the Great Sea Kingdom, which is a blatant provocation. No, we can&#x27;t swallow this. The president stopped and said through gritted teeth. Issue an announcement immediately. Publicly condemn the great Sia kingdom.</p>
<p>We accuse them of disrupting regional peace and demand compensation for the losses. We also need to join forces with the US to put pressure on Great Sia. Soon, the Philippines has been released. The Great Sa Kingdom illegally destroyed warships on our territory, a serious violation of international law. We strongly condemn the barbaric actions of the great Sia Kingdom and demand immediate compensation.</p>
<p>If a satisfactory response is not provided, we will unite international forces and take action against the great Sia Kingdom. The announcement was released. Philippine nizens were instantly outraged. Has the Great Sea Kingdom gone mad? How dare they? How dare they destroy our country&#x27;s property? We must avenge them. Avenge our fallen countrymen.</p>
<p>Some people are criticizing the Great Sea Kingdom online, but most people are afraid. It&#x27;s over. The Great Sea Kingdom even dares to touch a broken warship. Does that mean they&#x27;ll attack us directly in the future? No. From now on, we must stay far away from the waters of the Great Sea Kingdom when we go to sea.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. This time, the Great Sea Kingdom is serious. I just hope that damn government doesn&#x27;t ruin its own life and drag us down with it. The Great Sea Kingdom even dared to bomb a broken warship. Doesn&#x27;t that mean they could attack them at any moment? They had previously crossed the line and provoked others in various ways.</p>
<p>At most, they&#x27;ll get sprayed with water cannons by the Great Sea Kingdom, but after this time, who knows if the Great Sea Kingdom will directly resort to force. Many Filipino monkeys are filled with anxiety. Chapter 48. The Great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s strong counterattack. The Philippines has just been posted on its international website.</p>
<p>The global internet exploded instantly. The Sakura Kingdom forum is filled with exclamation marks. What? It really is the Great Sa Kingdom that has made a move. This is completely out of character for them. Damn it.</p>
<p>It seems like the Great Sa Kingdom is getting more and more hawkish lately. They wouldn&#x27;t want revenge on us, would they? Many nizens in Japan are starting to worry. What happened during this period? The US&#x27;s global drone was shot down. Indian border troops invaded, resulting in bloodshed. Now we&#x27;ve arrived at the Filipino monkeys dilapidated warship.</p>
<p>All indications suggest that the great Sia Kingdom is developing in a hawkish direction. However, some of the younger generation are full of doubts. It must have been orchestrated by the Philippines. How could the Great Sea Kingdom have such audacity? That&#x27;s right. Given the weak and cowardly nature of the Great Sia Kingdom, they certainly wouldn&#x27;t dare to do that.</p>
<p>The Philippines is trying to make a sense of its existence. But this kind of sound, it was quickly drowned out by other comments. On the other side, South Korea s reaction was even more intense. A certain military forum crashed three times. Damn it.</p>
<p>Is the great Sia Kingdom going crazy? They even dared to touch America&#x27;s little brother. What weapon did they use to destroy it? Is it another laser cannon? Really? We&#x27;re less than 1,000 km away from the Great Sea Kingdom. Many young people began to panic. Our King Sajong s warship is still near the South China Sea. Could we be being watched? No one dared to speak for a moment.</p>
<p>Everyone is afraid of becoming the next disappearing warship. On the US Twitter account, the art style has completely changed. Netzens who were clamoring to crush the Great Sea just a few days ago are now all panicking.  just how much advanced technology does the Great Sa Kingdom have? Have we really fallen behind? Otapu, come out and explain. Can our aircraft carrier withstand laser cannons? In the comment section, the voices of concern drowned out the previous arrogance.</p>
<p>They were influenced by science fiction movies from a young age. There is a sense of awe and fear towards groundbreaking weapons. Seeing how powerful the laser weapons of the Great Sea Kingdom are, the American public has begun to worry. Have they fallen too far behind? Will the Great Sea Kingdom settle scores with us later? In contrast, consider the network of the Great Sea Kingdom. They were completely engrossed in the realry.</p>
<p>Top 10 trending topics on Weibo. Nine of them are related to the disappearance of the broken warship. Huh? We finally blew up that damn warship. After holding back for so many years, it&#x27;s so satisfying. The Filipino fisherman dared to provoke us before.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see if they dare to provoke us again. Today is a good day, huh? Some netizens shared screenshots of news reports about the Philippines crossing the border. Remember when they said, &quot;This is our waters.&quot; Do they still dare to do that now? A message from the veteran old squad leader steel gun. Back when I was patrolling the South China Sea, I felt so frustrated looking at that dilapitated warship. I finally saw it was gone today.</p>
<p>It was all worth it. The number of likes instantly exceeded 1 million. Even official media outlets have gotten involved. The official Weebo account of the Ministry of National Defense posted a picture of a laser cannon with the caption, &quot;We welcome friends with good wine, but we have laser cannons to deal with wolves.&quot; The number of reposts exceeded 10 million in half an hour. Internationally, intelligence agencies from various countries are working overtime overnight.</p>
<p>Prime Minister&#x27;s office of the three Arab countries demo the immortals slammed the report on the ground. Useless. All of you are useless. He pointed his finger at the intelligence minister and cursed him. They said before that the great Sia kingdom wouldn&#x27;t dare to touch the Philippines.</p>
<p>And now the warships are all gone. The intelligence chief lowered his head, his voice trembling. Prime Minister, according to satellite data, the type 055 destroyer of the great Sia Kingdom was operating in the no navigation zone of the South China Sea today. Could they be testing some new weapon? Demo. The immortal sat down abruptly, his face grim.</p>
<p>Did they install laser cannons on their warships? Impossible. Absolutely impossible. Even if it were mounted on a warship, its range wouldn&#x27;t be that far. He vehemently denied his own suspicions. Laser weapons.</p>
<p>India is also conducting research. But it has too many drawbacks, especially at sea. It&#x27;s passable as an anti-aircraft weapon. However, using it as a naval gun is almost impossible unless the great Sia Kingdom can perfectly resolve those drawbacks. But the thought of border conflicts, the power of that lightsaber is still vivid in my mind.</p>
<p>Could it be that the great Sia Kingdom has really made a major breakthrough in the field of laser cannons? Thinking about this, Demo was sweating profusely. Give the order immediately. Border troops withdraw 50 km. No one is allowed to approach the border without my order. Naval staff officer Korm asked cautiously.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, while our two carrier strike groups continue to participate in joint military exercises, Demo the Immortal paused for a few seconds and spoke. Join, but you must hide at the very back. If anything seems a miss, retreat immediately. He dare not gamble. If the Great Sa Kingdom really breaks through the physical limits, wait for other countries to take the lead.</p>
<p>They can just stay in the back and paddle around the White House of the US. OTP&#x27;s face was terribly grim. He angrily slammed his coffee cup down and roared. The great Sa Kingdom is provoking us. We know perfectly well that the Philippines is our little brother.</p>
<p>How dare they touch their property? Hateful. Defense Secretary Pitt stood to the side, his face grave, &quot;Mr. President, what do we do now? Should the joint military exercises continue?&quot; OTP clenched his fist and said angrily, &quot;We definitely have to continue. How could we back down because of this? The joint military exercises will proceed as scheduled. Let the warships of Japan and the Philippines lead the way to probe.</p>
<p>He knew it in his heart. This time it&#x27;s just for show. We must carry out the military exercises to the end. Otherwise, they will become a laughingstock for the whole world. This is a good opportunity to send Japanese warships to probe the area.</p>
<p>The prime minister&#x27;s official residence in Japan. Prime Minister Jiro Kishida was filled with disbelief. Did the great Sia Kingdom touch that dilapitated warship from the African country? Yes, the defense minister nodded. Prime Minister, according to our investigation, the news of the destroyed warship is 90% likely that it was done by the great Sia Kingdom. Should we still participate in the joint military exercises? Kishaurro was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>We must participate in the joint military exercises. If possible, we should be at the forefront. Only in this way can we demonstrate the strength of our cherry blossom country to the whole world. Yes, sir. The defense minister dared not object any further.</p>
<p>While countries were still analyzing and panicking, the Ministry of National Defense of the Great Sea Kingdom and its official Weibo account simultaneously released a statement. Statement regarding the incident involving the Philippine Navy&#x27;s destroyed warship. One, the Great Sea Kingdom possesses indisputable sovereignty over the relevant waters of the South China Sea. Two, any provocative act by any country will be met with a resolute counterattack. Three, warn certain countries not to try to threaten us with joint military exercises.</p>
<p>Four, the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s defense forces are sufficient to protect every inch of its land and every stretch of its sea. Those who offend our great Sea, though far away, shall be punished. And nizens from the Great Sea Kingdom, it boiled to its absolute peak. That&#x27;s so powerful. The line, &quot;Those who offend our great Sea, though far away, shall be punished,&quot; is so satisfying.</p>
<p>Huh? Now, I&#x27;m actually looking forward to the joint military exercises with the US. Yes, that way we&#x27;ll have a chance to get revenge. Americans, you absolutely cannot back down. You must give us a chance. Almost all the people of Great Sa are looking forward to the joint military exercises with the United States and the United States.</p>
<p>At the same time, that statement also caused a global stir. Philippine President Maslo looked at the statement and his face turned as red as a monkeykey&#x27;s bottom. Damn it. How dare they do this? The Great Sa Kingdom is simply too arrogant. The intelligence chief stood to the side, his face grim.</p>
<p>Mr. President, what do we do now? Should we continue targeting the Great Sa Kingdom? Little Mars eyes were filled with anger. Against? We must address this. Our people cannot die in vain. The Great Sea Kingdom must pay the price.</p>
<p>We can do it like this. Chapter 49. Securing a staggering 80 billion yuan in military sales orders. Little Moss became more and more excited as he spoke. His eyes were filled with malice.</p>
<p>On the day of the joint military exercise, organizing a large number of fishermen to pretend to cross the border, send more fishing boats equipped with cameras, and head towards the no navigation zone of Great Sea. as long as the great sea patrol ships dare to stop us. The fleets of eight countries used the pretext of protecting fishermen to directly surround the patrol ship. Then he he became more and more agitated as he spoke. Spit sprayed all over the intelligence minister&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>The intelligence minister was beaming with excitement, eyes gleaming like a hungry wolf. The president is brilliant. This way we can get revenge without actually going to war. That feels so good. The Minister of Defense slapped his thigh in agreement.</p>
<p>Yes, even if Great Sia doesn&#x27;t accept the challenge, we can also cry out, &quot;We&#x27;ve been bullied internationally to gain sympathy.&quot; The senior executives in the conference room all expressed their support. I agree. I&#x27;ll handle the arrangements with the fishermen. I guarantee the performance will be convincing. The publicity department has already prepared the press release.</p>
<p>Just waiting for the conflict to occur. I&#x27;ll handle the liaison with those eight countries. They&#x27;ll definitely be willing to cooperate. More than a dozen hands were raised at the same time and not one objected. Little Mars looked at the scene before him and a sinister smile crept onto his lips.</p>
<p>Excellent. On November 11th, let&#x27;s make Great SA famous. The lobby of the United Nations headquarters. Reporters surrounded the representatives from various countries, pressing them with questions. What is your country&#x27;s view on the statement made by Great Sia? Will you support the Philippines compensation claim? The representative from Japan didn&#x27;t even look up, flipping through the documents in his hand.</p>
<p>No comment for now. The South Korean representative walked quickly, leaving only the words, &quot;Watching!&quot; before disappearing into the elevator. Even Australia, which used to jump around the most enthusiastically, is now included. They only vaguely said, &quot;Respect the sovereignty of all countries.&quot; The entire hall, no one dared to speak directly to them. Everyone knows the great Sia of today is not a pushover that can be easily manipulated.</p>
<p>Destroy the wrecked warship of the Philippines. The statement dared to make another harsh statement. This is enough to prove the strength of the great Sia Kingdom. At a time like this, who would dare to provoke the Great Sia Kingdom? They might be the next ones to disappear. The White House of the US.</p>
<p>Oep looked at the statement released by the Great Sa Kingdom and his face turned completely red. The military exercise on November 11th must be a big one for the great Sia Kingdom. Defense Secretary Pit stood to the side holding the military exercise plan in his hand. Don&#x27;t worry, Mr. President.</p>
<p>The Y isumo and other warships from Japan have set sail. The South Korean warship King Sang is also heading towards the South China Sea. OTEP calmed down and pressed on with the question, where is India? Where is their aircraft carrier battle group? The Indian aircraft carrier has already passed the straight of Malaa and will arrive soon. Pete explained nodded. Then let Japan and the Philippines go first and our aircraft carrier will bring up the rear.</p>
<p>This time we must make the great Sia Kingdom submit. No matter what, we cannot allow the Great Sa Kingdom to continue to be so arrogant. We be willing to let Japan become cannon fodder. Understood, Mr. President.</p>
<p>Pete quickly replied. Pingua Company headquarters. Cook sat in his office. The computer screen in front of me showed the latest announcement from the great SEA Kingdom. It&#x27;s over.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom is so tough. Wasn&#x27;t my 50 billion just given away for nothing. Now, Cook finally realized what was happening. No wonder Dia signed a contract with him so readily back then. Moreover, the way that staff member looked at him at the time always seemed strange.</p>
<p>Now, thinking back carefully, isn&#x27;t that the look you give someone an idiot? How could I have been so stupid back then? None of the other three countries in the great Sea Kingdom have been able to purchase quantum chips. Why should you sell it to me? Cook thought about it, the more he realized how incredibly stupid he had become. Slap, slap. Cook regretted it so much he slapped himself. Sudden my phone suddenly rang.</p>
<p>Cook stopped his self harm and took out his phone to check. It is the name of Penguin&#x27;s largest shareholder. He took a deep breath and answered the phone. The call was just connected. Then came an angry war.</p>
<p>Cook, where&#x27;s the quantum chip? Why haven&#x27;t we seen him yet? Did you and Da embezzle 50 billion? No, absolutely not. Cook hurriedly explained. I&#x27;ve been urging them, too. It should be done soon. Soon, the shareholders voice grew even more aggressive.</p>
<p>If we haven&#x27;t seen the chips by next week, you&#x27;re fired. With a snap, the phone hung up. Cook held his phone, his eyes filled with frustration and resentment. He looked out at the tall buildings. The scene of spending a lot of money to buy quantum chips flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p>50 billion. It&#x27;s all gone down the drain. Tears streamed down her cheeks and dripped onto the ground. He suddenly understood. Penguin did not lose to Huawei.</p>
<p>It was the technology of the entire great sea that made them lose. The great sea of today. It&#x27;s no longer the country that needs to cater to the whims of the US. However, he still viewed the great Sia kingdom with the same mindset he had before. That&#x27;s why such a tragedy happened.</p>
<p>Perhaps Pingua will eventually come to an end as well. The reception room of the military logistics and equipment department. At this time, military representatives were receiving a group of wealthy Middle Eastern tycoons. Sartra was represented by wearing a white robe with gold trim. He fiddled with a gemstone ring the size of a pigeon&#x27;s egg in his hand and made boastful remarks.</p>
<p>Representative Louu, we need 10 laser cannons. Your previous model cost 100 million. We&#x27;ll invest 1 billion in the new model as long as we can deliver it immediately. The UAE representative nodded in agreement. We want eight sets, too.</p>
<p>Money is no problem. We can pay in full today. Kakar&#x27;s representative was even more direct, pulling out a black card. We want 50 sets, 50 billion upfront, and we&#x27;ll make up the difference if that&#x27;s not enough. A group of Nuvo Ree sat on the sofa.</p>
<p>There was not a trace of hesitation on his face. They had seen videos of the great SEA laser cannon destroying the US Global Hawk. I know how powerful this thing is. More important than money. The most important thing is to safeguard their homeland security.</p>
<p>Representative Lu sat in the main seat smiling and waving his hand. Thank you all for your love and support for our great SIA kingdom. The new laser cannon can be exported, but it can only be a stripped down version. Range 150 km. Other performance characteristics unchanged.</p>
<p>if you don&#x27;t accept. He hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. 150 km. Representative Sartra interrupted excitedly. That&#x27;s enough.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s more than enough for our country. The UAE representative couldn&#x27;t wait. 150 km is already impressive. Let&#x27;s sign the contract now. The representative from QAR pushed the black card forward.</p>
<p>Full payment now. When can we deliver? They were terrified that the great SA kingdom would return. I can&#x27;t wait to sign the contract, then pay the full amount immediately. Representative Louu saw them like this. Too lazy to explain, he simply told someone to print out the contract.</p>
<p>The contract was printed out quickly. Representative Louu handed them over to the Middle East representatives, respectively. Delivery within one week. In addition, we also provide services for subsequent maintenance and upgrades. Of course, it&#x27;s also charged.</p>
<p>The Middle Eastern Tycoon was even happier to hear this. The price is reasonable. It&#x27;s free. We&#x27;re afraid something might go wrong. The pen flew across the contract as he signed it.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t care about spending money at all. They were able to buy top tier weapons from the Great Sa. It is itself a kind of honor and a guarantee. The current international situation. Only the weapons of the Great Sa Kingdom can ensure their safety.</p>
<p>After the contract was signed, Sartra asked expectantly, &quot;Representative Lu, has your great Sia considered the presence of our country&#x27;s troops? The kind where you can plant anywhere. Chapter 50 unlocks new technologies. Seventh generation space fighter. Sarter&#x27;s words had barely fallen. The air in the reception room fell silent instantly.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Middle Eastern tycoons shone like light bulbs as they stared intently at Representative Lu. Once Representative Lu agrees to Sarter&#x27;s request, they will also submit an application. As long as the Great Sa Kingdom has troops stationed there, they don&#x27;t need to worry about homeland security. Representative Lu still had a smile on his face, but his heart was in turmoil. Garrison, this is not as simple as selling weapons.</p>
<p>The great SA dynasty never pursued hegemonic practices. Exporting weapons is permissible, but stationing troops there changes the nature of the situation. Absolutely not. Representative Lou&#x27;s voice was gentle, yet carried an undeniable firmness. Representative Sartra, thank you for your trust.</p>
<p>But when it comes to stationing troops, our great Sia has its rules. We can sell weapons, but stationing troops is absolutely out of the question. This rule cannot be broken. I see, Representative Sartre said with some disappointment. The UAE representative, still somewhat persistent, continued to inquire.</p>
<p>Representative Louu. We can discuss the terms. Choose any territory you like. We&#x27;ll pay you. Kakar&#x27;s representative nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Yes, as long as you&#x27;re willing to come, money is not a problem. Representative Louu shook his head again. We&#x27;ll sell the weapons. We&#x27;ll handle the subsequent maintenance, but stationing troops here is really not an option. Your home is ultimately your own responsibility to protect.</p>
<p>What we can give you is the confidence to hold on. The Middle Eastern tycoons exchanged glances, their eyes filled with disappointment. But I didn&#x27;t press the matter further. After all, being able to buy a laser cannon is already a huge gain. Representative Sartraighed.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s do what Lu says. Full payment now. After saying that, they contacted someone in China to transfer the money. Soon, the great Sia Kingdom received the payment confirmation. Representative Lu finally broke into a genuine smile.</p>
<p>He picked up the contract and handed it over. Deliver on time in one week. I wish us a pleasant cooperation. Siaki Yuan Li Jiang Wo held the military procurement list with great surprise. 88 sets of downgraded laser cannons, a full payment of 88 billion.</p>
<p>These Middle Eastern tycoons are really rich. Lyn Shan, sitting next to him, was also a little surprised when he heard the price. Didn&#x27;t the full version only cost a little over a million? Even the stripped down version sells for 1 billion. Lie Jian Guo nodded, &quot;Yes, it was the Middle Eastern client who set the price themselves. A true tycoon is a true tycoon.&quot; Lynch inside.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so good to be rich. With this 88 billion, the super laser cannon can be quickly deployed to the army. Li Jian Guo put down the list and looked at Lynshan. You&#x27;ve thought ahead. By the way, how&#x27;s the progress on the anti-gravity plasma engine? Lynch put away the blueprints, his eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>The parts are already being manufactured. The first prototype can be assembled in at most half a month. Once the prototype passes testing, we can design other engine models according to our needs. So fast, Li Jang Guo exclaimed in surprise. Then our fighter jets can just crash into it and use it.</p>
<p>Lynch and shook his head. It might not work. Why? Lie Jian Guo asked anxiously. If it cannot be used directly, what is the purpose of developing this engine? The problem of fighter jets lacking engines has not yet been solved. Lynn Shin explained with a smile.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, don&#x27;t be nervous. I&#x27;ve seen the design blueprints for previous fighter jets. If we want to use an anti-gravity plasma engine, it will require major modifications. It would be better to redesign a new aerospace fighter based on this engine.</p>
<p>He was indeed dissatisfied with the previous fighter jets. They want to redesign a completely new aerospace fighter. In the inheritance space, the anti-gravity plasma engine has also reached its final stage. as long as it is recognized through the space of inheritance that will unlock the next technological legacy. Lyn Chun is preparing to select an aerospace fighter jet redesign space fighter jets.</p>
<p>Upon hearing these words, Lie Jian Guo was instantly overjoyed. His gaze was fixed on Lynch. Shaolin, do you already have a design idea? Lynch nodded. Really? That&#x27;s great. Lie Jian Guo exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Lynchin really is always surprising him. The anti-gravity plasma engine is not finished yet. They&#x27;ve already started designing space fighters. That&#x27;s absolutely outrageous. He truly is a prodigy.</p>
<p>Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;Oldly, don&#x27;t get too excited. At present, it&#x27;s just an idea. The design plan will take some time to come out.&quot; Lie Jian Guo waved his hand. No rush. Let&#x27;s get the engine sorted out first.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been waiting for so long. I don&#x27;t mind a few more months. Sometimes he really wanted to crack open Lynch&#x27;s head and take a look. What will be more than them? They can come up with all sorts of advanced design concepts. Anti-gravity plasma engine is already impressive enough.</p>
<p>Now they&#x27;re even developing space planes. That&#x27;s a product of science fiction. If it really comes true, the air force of the great Sea Kingdom will soon become the dominant force on Earth. Whether it&#x27;s near Earth space or the airspace inside Earth, they are all invincible beings. Lynchin saw how excited Lie Jang Wo was.</p>
<p>I then gave him a brief introduction to the design concept of the space fighter. Li Jang Wo became more and more excited as he listened. They couldn&#x27;t wait for Lynchin to approve the project. However, Lynchin rejected him. Night.</p>
<p>Lynchin returned to his apartment from the lab. After washing up, I lay on the bed and entered the Inheritance Space Laboratory. In the laboratory, anti-gravity plasma engine has been assembled to the final stage. It must be done tonight. Lynshan looked at the engine components in front of him, his eyes revealing determination and anticipation.</p>
<p>He skillfully picked up the last precision part. Slowly install it into the designated location. 2 hours later, with a final slight mechanical sound, the entire anti-gravity plasma engine has been completed. Congratulations, host, on inheriting the power of the anti-gravity plasma engine. The next technological inheritance has been unlocked.</p>
<p>Please select one call. Finally finished. Hearing the familiar voice, Lynn Shin&#x27;s eyes lit up with excitement. More than a month, he started by processing parts all by himself. Handcraft an anti-gravity plasma engine.</p>
<p>During this period, in order to achieve the best results, the project was scrapped and started over many times. The goal is to enable rapid mass production. In reality, now it&#x27;s finally finished. This can unlock the next technological inheritance. Lynshan opened the inheritance list.</p>
<p>200,000 ton nuclearpowered aircraft carrier. Super electromagnetic rail gun. 7th generation space fighter. Controlled nuclear fusion. Armored match.</p>
<p>Looking at the technologies in the list, Lynshin&#x27;s breathing became rapid. These are all cuttingedge technologies that are capable of changing the world order. Each option was like a dazzling star, shining with an alluring light before his eyes. A 200,000 ton nuclearpowered aircraft carrier. Just thinking about it gets my blood pumping.</p>
<p>That would be the invincible overlord of the seas. And any sea area on Earth could become its backyard. It&#x27;s still a super electromagnetic rail gun. It is another groundbreaking weapon on par with the super laser cannon. Armored mesh are most likely like Optimus Prime from science fiction movies.</p>
<p>There is also controlled nuclear fusion. This is the ultimate energy solution that humanity has been dreaming of. Once mastered, the energy crisis will become a thing of the past. From now on, we will never have to worry about energy again. In a short time, Lynchin also found herself struggling with making a decision.</p>
<p>It seems that every technology is very helpful to the Great Sia Kingdom at present, especially controlled nuclear fusion. For the Great Sea Kingdom at present, this is quite important. But the idea was that a prototype of the plasma engine could be built immediately if there is no suitable fighter jet. The advantages of plasma engines would then be difficult to fully realize. Gritting his teeth, Lynn Shun made his choice.</p>
<p>Choose seventh generation aerospace fighter technology. Chapter 51. First test of anti-gravity plasma engine. The moment Lin Shan made his choice. Numerous design drawings for 7th generation space fighters.</p>
<p>Performance parameters and manufacturing process. It flooded his mind like a tidal wave. The complete set of technical documents is extremely detailed. It even details the material formula for each individual screw. There&#x27;s also a brand new stealth material formula, beyond the line 3D visual radar, advanced AI powered driving technology, a brand new weapon deployment technology solution, terrifying speed and ammunition capacity.</p>
<p>This space fighter is defying the heavens. Lynchan was deeply shocked after receiving all the technology based on the parameters of the seventh generation aerospace fighter. This is a devastating blow to all current fighter jets on Earth. With this technical information, this aerospace fighter jet has performance indicators that exceed expectations. It not only has the ability to cruise in space for extended periods of time within the atmosphere, it is an invincible force.</p>
<p>More importantly, this fighter jet is perfectly compatible with anti-gravity plasma engines. To maximize the performance of the engine, now the air force of the great sea kingdom is truly about to take off. A burning light shone in Lin Chen&#x27;s eyes. He could almost see seventh generation aerospace fighters slicing through the sky. It became the most dazzling presence in the skies above the blue planet.</p>
<p>After digesting the technology of the seventh generation aerospace fighter, Lynshin couldn&#x27;t wait to get started in the inheritant space laboratory. Two weeks later, Siakiuan Aviation Laboratory. The silver white anti-gravity plasma engine sits in the center, its streamlined casing gleaming with a cold light. Its appearance alone is full of science fiction. It&#x27;s a completely different concept from traditional aircraft engines.</p>
<p>Wearing his reading glasses, Liian Guo circled the engine three times, not daring to touch it. His eyes were filled with excitement and his voice trembled. This is an anti-gravity plasma engine. They really built it. He hadn&#x27;t expected it to be a completely new engine.</p>
<p>In less than 2 months, the design and prototype assembly were completed. This speed is simply outrageous. Back when they were developing turboan engines. It has taken more than 3 years, and we have only managed to create a preliminary prototype. This is the anti-gravity plasma engine, just over a month.</p>
<p>It is also an anti-gravity technology that is one of the world&#x27;s unsolved problems. It&#x27;s simply a miracle in the aviation industry. Lyn Shun, standing to the side, nodded. Mr. ly the engine has been fully assembled.</p>
<p>Now we just wait for the test. Theademicians and engineers around him all wore expressions of barely suppressed excitement. His gaze was fixed on the silver white anti-gravity plasma engine. Some people couldn&#x27;t help but whisper among themselves. Unexpectedly, we actually built a groundbreaking aircraft engine within a month.</p>
<p>Yes, who would have thought that such a miracle would happen around us. It&#x27;s all thanks to Chief Engineer Lynn. He led us to accomplish this epicmaking feat. That&#x27;s right. Without Chief Engineer Lynn, we wouldn&#x27;t have achieved what we have today.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, everyone looked at Lynn Shan with admiration. We&#x27;ve spent over a month together. They learned a lot of useful technical knowledge from Lynchin. Many people have seen a significant improvement in their research capabilities during this period. Lynchin quietly observed the excited expressions on everyone&#x27;s faces.</p>
<p>Salin, let&#x27;s start the test and see what the specific parameters are. Li Jang Guoo walked up to Lin Chan, his voice filled with excitement. Lynch nodded and began to give instructions. Conduct a final check immediately. After confirming everything is correct, begin the test.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. The engineer, who was initially excited, was now in a state of high spirits. Get to work immediately. 10 minutes later, Chief Engineer Lynn, the inspection is complete. Nothing has been missed.</p>
<p>Okay. Lynch nodded. Then let&#x27;s begin the test. Measure the thrust first. Objective: simulate 50 tons of thrust.</p>
<p>What? Li Jian Guo was utterly shocked. Shaolin, you&#x27;re going to measure 50 tons of thrust directly. The other engineers were also shocked. Right off the bat, they immediately tested the 50 ton load capacity. Anyone who owns an aircraft engine knows this.</p>
<p>The US&#x27;s most advanced XN 100 engine. The maximum thrust is only 220 knots or about 22 tons. That immediately doubled the amount. Is this defying the heavens? Lynn Shan smiled confidently. This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see after the tests are done. All right. Lie Jian Guo calmed his excited emotions. As per Chief Engineer Lynn&#x27;s instructions, let&#x27;s begin the test. The engineers immediately took action.</p>
<p>After setting the simulated thrust, press the engine start button. The indicator lights on the engine casing lit up one by one, emitting a slight hum. The entire engine startup process was unusually quiet. Yet, it also contains a sense of power that is about to be unleashed as all the indicator lights turned green. Thrust simulation initiated.</p>
<p>3 2 1 begin. As the countdown ended, almost at the same instant, the entire laboratory seemed to be shaken by a tremendous force. Everyone could feel the ground beneath their feet trembling slightly. Thrust data is being uploaded. Real-time monitoring in progress.</p>
<p>The thrust data on the screen started to fluctuate. 100 knots, 500 knots, 1,000 knots. It suddenly surged to 2,000 knots. Then it stabilized completely. Why not promote? Because it has already reached the limit of the testing equipment.</p>
<p>See the data displayed on the screen. Liian Guo and the engineers were all stunned and dumbfounded. The most advanced engine in the United States only has a thrust of 220 knots. The current power plasma engine has already reached a terrifying 2,000 knots in initial tests. And that&#x27;s not even the limit.</p>
<p>Terrifying. Li Jian Guo was staring at the data when he suddenly snapped out of his days and hurriedly called for a stop. Stop it. The thrust has exceeded the instruments testing range and the instrument cannot withstand it. The engineers snapped out of his days.</p>
<p>The engine was quickly shut off. The surrounding engineers instantly erupted in excitement. My god, 10 times the thrust in the first test. This is terrifying. Won&#x27;t our fighter jets be able to cruise at supersonic speeds at will in the future? This is still the limit of our testing equipment, not the limit of the engine.</p>
<p>All the engineers were deeply shocked by the test data of 2,000 knots. The key point is that this engine only weighs 1 ton. This shows just how terrifying his final thrust to weight ratio is. Whether it&#x27;s a large aircraft or a fighter jet, they can easily break through the supersonic flight barrier. Lie Jian Guo came to Linshins side and said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Shaolin, it seems that our testing equipment can no longer meet the needs of this engine. Lynch nodded, &quot;It&#x27;s all right. We can just install it and test it later. Next, let&#x27;s continue testing the lifespan. Goal: To achieve 10,000 hours of continuous simulated operation.&quot; Okay.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo didn&#x27;t question it this time. The simulated lifespan test has begun. Time pass second by second. The running time on the screen keeps increasing. 100 hours.</p>
<p>500 hours. 1,000 hours. 5,000 hours. 10,000 hours. The engine&#x27;s parameters remain stable, showing no signs of degradation.</p>
<p>Looking at the data, Liang Guo was so excited that his eyes welled up with tears. 10,000 hours and zero degradation. The USF135 service life is only 2,000 hours. Our machine has already run 10,000 hours and it&#x27;s still as good as new. If this is the absolute limit, it&#x27;s estimated to be 50 times theirs.</p>
<p>The engineers around were so excited that they had tears in their eyes. Lynchin walked over and patted Lee Gian Guo on the shoulder. Oldly this isn&#x27;t over yet. Initiating anti-gravity mode moment. All the engineers were filled with anticipation once again.</p>
<p>This is the most important part. Anti-gravity. Who can break through this technology? They will all become the eighth wonder of the world. The engineer pressed another button. A pale blue light suddenly appeared at the bottom of the engine.</p>
<p>The entire engine slowly rose into the air. It hangs 1 meter above the ground, completely still. Looking at the floating engine, Lie Giani Guo suddenly burst into tears. It&#x27;s done. It really is done.</p>
<p>We now have our own advanced engines. I&#x27;ll never have to put up with other people&#x27;s attitudes again. The surrounding engineers also applauded. Some people even jumped up in excitement. After the initial excitement, holding the final data, Lie Jian Guo said to Lynn Chun, &quot;Shaolin, you have done another great service for our great Sia.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go report to the high commander right away. Let them be happy, too.&quot; Chapter 52. Naval Strength Source. Lie Jian Guo held the test report. He left the lab without looking back.</p>
<p>The silver white anti-gravity plasma engine still hangs in the center of the laboratory. The engineers didn&#x27;t even notice Lie Gian Guo leaving. Their eyes were all focused on the engine that was suspended 1 meter in the air. This is so sci-fi. We&#x27;ve really achieved anti-gravity.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. We have really cracked the anti-gravity technology. The one-ton feels like it&#x27;s not affected by gravity at all. This is amazing. With it, our Air Force&#x27;s equipment will experience a qualitative leap.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not just for the Air Force. Its applications are incredibly wide-ranging. A group of engineers excitedly gathered around the engine. They discussed it back and forth, each offering their own perspective. His face was full of excitement and pride.</p>
<p>If it&#x27;s not confidential, they all wanted to take a picture of this amazing scene with their phones. For a long time, Lynchin clapped his hands as he looked at the excited engineers. Everyone, let&#x27;s continue the test. Thrust, lifespan, and anti-gravity mode are just the basics. Start testing under extreme conditions now.</p>
<p>Simulating various extreme environments such as high altitude, low temperatures, high humidity sea surfaces, and electromagnetic interference. The engineers snapped back to reality, their eyes shining even brighter than before. All right, we&#x27;ll do as chief engineer Lynn says. The engineers snapped out of their excitement. He then continued to devote himself wholeheartedly to the simulation testing work.</p>
<p>They quickly typed commands into the console and the data on the screen began to fluctuate wildly. The engine&#x27;s hum changed slightly but remained stable. Lynchin stood aside quietly observing the various indicators. He wanted more than just functionality. He wanted absolute reliability.</p>
<p>After all, this engine is the heart of his next project, the aerospace fighter. There can&#x27;t be any problems. At the same time, Lie Jian Guo returned to his office. He took a red cell phone out of the drawer. &quot;Calm down your excited emotions.</p>
<p>After thinking about the wording of my report, only then did I slowly dial that familiar number. Beep beep beep.&quot; The phone rang for a long time. Just when Lie Jian Guo thought the leader was busy, the call was connected. &quot;Hello.&quot; A dignified yet gentle voice rang out. Lie Jian Guo quickly spoke up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, boss, I have some great news to report. The first test of the anti-gravity plasma engine was a success. There was a two-c silence on the other end of the phone. Then came a steady but slightly excited voice. Okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>How is the performance? Without hesitation, Lie Jiano reported all the parameters and data. The above data is only preliminary test data. Kobayashi said that the extreme data will be even more terrifying than this. Based on current data, it has already surpassed the most advanced aero engines in the United States. This means that we have completely broken through the US blockade.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. On the other end of the phone was silent for a few seconds. A moment later, the great leader&#x27;s unquestionable voice rang out. Very good, Comrade Jenua. I order you to mobilize the entire nation to support Comrade Lynch&#x27;s research and development efforts.</p>
<p>Any technology he proposes should be given priority in resource allocation. Furthermore, we will award Lynchin an honorary military rank and we will absolutely not allow comrade Lynch to suffer the slightest injustice. Finally, tell comrade Lynchin that the country will always be his support. Let him do whatever he wants. Moment.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo held the phone, his eyes instantly reening. He lived almost his entire life. This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen the country attach so much importance to a young person. He hung up the phone. Lie Jian Guo leaned back in his chair, unable to calm down for a long time.</p>
<p>He murmured to himself, &quot;Kobayashi, now you can focus on your research. He knows. With Lynchin around, the time when the great Sia Kingdom stands at the pinnacle of blue star will be infinitely shortened.&quot; A moment later, Li Jian Guo calmed himself down. Then I went straight to the laboratory. He wanted to tell Lynn Chin the good news.</p>
<p>Laboratory. Lynchin was looking at the test poems at the back. Looking up, he saw Li Jango walk and looking excited and asked curiously. Oldly, you finished your report so quickly. Lie Jang Guoo walked quickly to him and pulled him into a small cubicle in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Shaolin, the leader highly praised you after hearing the report. Furthermore, the leadership has ordered that all research and development efforts be supported by the entire nation. All other benefits will be provided to you at the highest possible level. The leader said that we absolutely cannot let you suffer any injustice. Lynn Shun was deeply moved after hearing this.</p>
<p>I never expected the country to attach so much importance to it. At that moment, he knew that the choice he had made earlier was the right one. With the full support of the country, the technology for future inheritance spaces can be realized in reality very soon. After this period of time, Lynshin discovered that his physical fitness was still improving. Although it has not been systematically tested, but he felt that his physical fitness was even better than that of those elite soldiers.</p>
<p>Even in brain development, it surpasses Einstein. These are all benefits that the seed of inheritance has brought him. It&#x27;s like passing on a skill after another. He himself can also achieve corresponding improvement and evolution. This remarkable change made him even more convinced of the path he was on.</p>
<p>He clenched his fists tightly, his tone filled with unprecedented determination. Don&#x27;t worry, Mr. Lee. I guarantee that the anti-gravity plasma engine will be mass-produced within 1 month. Within 6 months, the aerospace fighter jet will achieve mass production.</p>
<p>Lie Giano patted him on the shoulder. Good, good. Go for it. I&#x27;ll do my best to allocate resources for you. Then, Lynchin went back to the lab to oversee the testing.</p>
<p>At the same time, South China Sea Fleet Naval Port, 10 frigots and nine destroyers were neatly lined up on the sea, their gray hulls gleaming coldly. Each warship is equipped with a silver white superpowered laser cannon at its bow and stern. There is also a special ship that has been equipped with a super laser cannon. Ziao Tiani, commander of the southern GuangDong military region, stood on the deck of the command ship looking at the final test report, his voice booming. Soldiers, listen up all of you.</p>
<p>All tests of the warship&#x27;s laser cannons have passed. Maximum range 1,500 km. 100% accuracy. The soldiers on deck erupted in chaos. Holy crap.</p>
<p>1,500 km. That&#x27;s incredible. If any more American aircraft carriers dare to come here, we&#x27;ll bomb them right away. Whoosh! Our Navy has finally taken off. Some people waved their hats excitedly, their eyes bloodshot.</p>
<p>I recall the frustration of being surrounded by the US fleet in the South China Sea in the past. At this moment, it all turned into a roar of fury. Seeing the soldiers excited expressions, Zhiao Tians eyes also became exceptionally fervent. He raised his hand to press down, then continued speaking. Pass the word down.</p>
<p>All warships shall be deployed immediately to key areas of the South China Sea. Isn&#x27;t the US going to conduct joint military exercises? Let&#x27;s wait here. If they dared to cross the line, &quot;Let them experience the power of our new weapons.&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; the soldiers responded in unison. Soon the warships engines roared to life. One after another, ships departed the naval port and headed towards the depths of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The seab breeze fluttered the ship&#x27;s insign and national flag, making them wave wildly. They went out this time to wait for their prey to come to them. Waiting for the US to come to us. Chapter 53. A massive Allied fleet.</p>
<p>Will history repeat itself? Deep in the South China Sea, the sea breeze whips up the waves. 10 frigots and nine destroyers were lined up in formation. The ship&#x27;s hull gleamed with a cold light. The silver white superpowered laser cannons are hidden at the bow and stern of the ship. Meanwhile, an inconspicuous ship was following at a distance.</p>
<p>After all, warships entered the designated sea area. Then it enters a silent state. They are simply waiting for their prey to come to them. only that special ship continued to drift towards the high seas. The White House of the US due to time difference.</p>
<p>It was already night, but the lights in the president&#x27;s office were still on. Ever since the great Sia Kingdom broke through their semiconductor blockade, President Otto never left early again. I have to work overtime every day to handle various tasks. At this moment, Otep leaned back in his leather seat. He held a cigar between his fingers, puffing out clouds of smoke.</p>
<p>On the desk lay a copy of the latest intelligence report title, the assembling of the Great Sa Navy in the South China Sea. Only 20 ships. OTP&#x27;s eyes were filled with disdain. He pressed the cigar into the ashtray and sparks flew up. Great Sia Kingdom, do you really think you can stop our eight nation coalitions exercises with just these 20 warships? Dream.</p>
<p>Otep looked at the intelligence report. His eyes were full of disdain. He also knew that the naval strength of the great sea kingdom had improved rapidly in recent years. But compared to the US, the gap is not small. Do they think they can use this small number of warships to counter their eight nation coalition? Obviously impossible.</p>
<p>However, OTP did not know this. Their intelligence missed one ship. They did not find that special ship. CIA director Tribes standing nearby nodded in agreement. The president is wise.</p>
<p>Our eight nation coalition has five aircraft carriers alone. The total number of destroyers and frigots exceeds 55. 10 more submarines, a total of 70 ships. What can the great Seia with only 20 warships do to fight us? Otep really liked this kind of compliment. His face was practically splitting open with laughter.</p>
<p>Trif, you have excellent taste. The maritime hijgemon of the blue planet will always be our eagle. They&#x27;re testing new weapons. They&#x27;re probably just trying to fool people. Triviket complimented.</p>
<p>Yes, the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s Navy is nothing but a bunch of clowns. If it were the army, they might still be wary, but the navy is simply not in the same league. We chatted for a while. OTP suddenly changed the subject. How&#x27;s the development of quantum lithography machines and laser cannons going? Tribes smile froze instantly and he explained in a low voice, &quot;President, progress is not ideal.</p>
<p>Quantum lithography technology has stagnated with no breakthroughs. The range of the laser cannon is only up to 80 km and it cannot solve the previous drawbacks. Their technology is far inferior to that of great SIA. No breakthrough at all. OTP&#x27;s face instantly darkened.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he stood up abruptly and slammed his fist on the table in anger. Waste. A bunch of useless trash. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been poured in. We&#x27;ve gathered all the top semiconductor scientists in our alliance, yet we haven&#x27;t made any breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Are those scientists just sitting around doing nothing? Triff looked completely innocent. He was only in charge of intelligence. They have no idea about technology. OTP simply asked him to keep an eye on the research and development progress. He&#x27;s only just started learning about it.</p>
<p>Although innocent, Triff still forced himself to explain. President, please calm down. Scientists have worked incredibly hard to achieve this breakthrough. But the technology of the great Sia dynasty is simply too advanced ahead of its time. OTP roared.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t try hard enough. Give the order immediately. Double the RD budget. Quantum lithography machines and laser cannons must be developed within 6 months. There are also six generation fighters.</p>
<p>Increase investment. We must not let great SIA get ahead again. Clear. Trif readily agreed. But deep down, I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic.</p>
<p>Although he doesn&#x27;t know much about technology. But he also knew some technologies cannot be developed in a very short time simply by throwing money at them. Often all it takes is a trigger. Or perhaps it was a sudden flash of inspiration from a scientist. That might lead to a breakthrough.</p>
<p>But Tri didn&#x27;t dare question Otep&#x27;s decision. They could only silently pass on the orders. OTP took a deep breath trying to calm himself down. walked to the floor to ceiling window. Looking out at the White House lawn, a fierce glint appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t the great Sia like to show off its muscles? Then I&#x27;ll show the whole world who the true overlord is. He turned to Secretary of State Raymond and gave the order. Pass the word down. Joint military exercises on November 11th. Broadcast live worldwide.</p>
<p>I will make great Xiaus face in front of the whole world. Let them know the consequences of going against the US. Yes. Lay Ming Duo responded once and then left the office. Soon, the US has released an official statement.</p>
<p>A joint military exercise involving eight countries will be broadcast live globally on November 11th. Stay tuned. The announcement was released. United States instantly erupted in excitement. They&#x27;re broadcasting a military exercise live.</p>
<p>Is the government planning something? The eight nation alliance has been mobilized. Let&#x27;s see how arrogant the Great Sa Kingdom is this time. Haha. This time will show the whole world the might of the American empire. The president is so commanding.</p>
<p>This is what our American nation should be like. The internet is flooded with all sorts of praise and clamor. It was as if the great Sia had become fish on their chopping board. Meanwhile, the international community was in an uproar. Sakura Kingdom Forum.</p>
<p>The screen was filled with arrogant remarks. Yoshi will finally show the great Sia what we&#x27;re made of in this military exercise. Our Isumo will be at the forefront. Great Sia Kingdom, wait for our cherry blossom kingdom to regain its former glory. South Korean nizens went even crazier.</p>
<p>King Sang s worship is the best in the world. Great Sia, it&#x27;s just a stolen country. This time we&#x27;ll show the great Sia the power of our South Korean nation. Philippines, the land of monkeys. President Moss also held a press conference directly.</p>
<p>We have the support of our big brother, the United States. We are no longer afraid of the great sea. With this military exercise, we are going to reclaim the waters that belong to us. India, the prime minister&#x27;s office. Demo.</p>
<p>The old immortal saw that the US was going to broadcast it globally. He immediately changed his mind. Order them to go ahead and this time move our two aircraft carriers a little further forward. We must flex our muscles in front of the whole world. Netizens from the great Sea Kingdom, on the contrary, remained very calm, even full of anticipation.</p>
<p>I bet the US is still this arrogant. I hope they don&#x27;t chicken out on the day of reckoning. Just wait. In time, you&#x27;ll know what despair truly means. Looking forward to November 11th.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see how great Sia proves us wrong. In the comments section, the voices were all full of confidence. Everyone was waiting to see the 8 nation coalition make a fool of itself. This is the confidence that technological breakthroughs bring to the Chinese people. If it were in the past, the news of the joint military exercises with the US has already drawn a barrage of criticism.</p>
<p>At that time, China&#x27;s naval strength was indeed far behind. Each time, all I could do was defend in frustration. Even if the US military sometimes oversteps its bounds, they only shouted to drive them away. Every time I see this, people in China often feel a sense of powerlessness. My heart was filled with frustration.</p>
<p>Yet, I felt helpless. But things are different now with continuous breakthroughs in technology. In addition, a super laser cannon was installed on the ship. The Navy&#x27;s strength experienced an explosive increase. The Chinese people have also stood tall.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the answer. The country now has the confidence and capability to meet any challenge. Those days of being bullied are gone forever. They are actually more eager for the US to act arrogantly and overstep its bounds this time. Just like before, then I can get my revenge.</p>
<p>Chapter 54. Instant kill. If you show your face, instant kill even if you don&#x27;t show your face. The land of cherry blossoms. Prime Minister&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jiro Kishida. The announcement from the US is causing excitement. Yoshi, the US made the right decision to hold a global live broadcast this time. It&#x27;s perfect for my great cherry blossom country. Show your skills on the international stage.</p>
<p>We must seize this opportunity. Since the end of World War II, Japan rarely displays its military strength on the international stage. The main reason was because of their defeat. It has signed a series of treaties restricting military development. Because of these treaties, the cherry blossom country must not vigorously develop its military.</p>
<p>But in recent years of the cherry blossom country tried every means possible. We must break free from the constraints of the treaty through various means. They are secretly accumulating strength in the military field. They even considered amending the constitution at one point. They want to vigorously develop the military.</p>
<p>They have never abandoned militaristic ideology. Given the opportunity, they still want to regain their former glory. This time it&#x27;s an eight- nation coalition military exercise. This is an opportunity for Japan to demonstrate its powerful military strength. Prime Minister, should we give orders to the fleet? Defense Minister Taro Yamamoto inquired.</p>
<p>It appears to be an inquiry, but the cunning look on his face betrayed him. Taro Yamamoto is a pure right-winger. He has been instigating high-ranking officials in the Japanese government to secretly develop military capabilities. On the surface, the total number of members of the Japanese self-defense forces is only 250,000. But actually, they have been secretly training as many as 1 million reserveists for a long time.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just a small island nation. They secretly train so many reserves. This reveals their wolfish ambitions. Kishidurro narrowed his eyes slightly. After thinking for a moment, he said, &quot;You secretly inform fleet commander Taro Kono.</p>
<p>Have him move our warship to the front. Find the right opportunity and cross the border directly into the territorial waters of the great Sia Kingdom.&quot; This time they send a total of one helicopter carrier, the Isumo for Congo class destroyers, 10 Moami class destroyers, a total of 15 warships. It already accounts for onetenth of their total of 150 ships. In the eight nation coalition, Japan, the land of cherry blossoms, sent the most warships. This was all to demonstrate their strength.</p>
<p>A hint of excitement flashed in Yamamoto Taros eyes, and he quickly nodded and said, &quot;The prime minister is wise. This time we must make our Sakura nation great again. Kishidajiro sneered and continued. Not only that, you also need to make Kono ready for battle. Once we enter the territorial waters of the great Sia Kingdom, if any obstacles are encountered, he can make his own decision.</p>
<p>Yamamoto was secretly delighted. Isn&#x27;t this just trying to let their warships run rampant in the territorial waters of the Great Sa Kingdom? The intention couldn&#x27;t be clearer. He quickly replied, &quot;Yes, prime minister. I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.&quot; After saying that, Taro Yamamoto hurriedly left the prime minister&#x27;s residence. Head to leers with fleet commander Taro Kono.</p>
<p>On the other side, high seas somewhere in the South China Sea. On the sea, warships are cutting through the waves. The warships of the eight nation coalition gathered here. The 15 warships from Japan were the most prominent among them. Japan, the Isumo class helicopter carrier.</p>
<p>It was designated as the command ship for the Japanese fleet. Fleet commander Taro Kono. After receiving orders from Yamamoto Taro, I got really excited. Yoshi, my chance to make a name for myself has come. Are you suggesting I make decisions with confidence? Isn&#x27;t it just giving me the greatest freedom and power? Konaro&#x27;s face revealed a greedy and fierce expression.</p>
<p>He was able to rise to the position of commander of the maritime self-defense force. Yamamoto s hidden meaning. Originally, it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be him, the commander of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, personally leading the team this time, but I heard it was a naval exercise in the South China Sea. Taro Kono volunteered to lead the team. The purpose was to find an opportunity to annoy the Great Sa Kingdom and then make a great contribution.</p>
<p>Now, the prime minister is giving him the greatest power that suits him perfectly. This time, we must seize the opportunity. Great Sia Kingdom, I hope you will not disappoint me. You must come and stop us. Taro Kono looked towards the South China Sea.</p>
<p>His eyes were filled with a provocative and greedy glint. It was as if they had already foreseen the victory that was about to come. But he didn&#x27;t know that he might become bait in this sea. The Great Sa Kingdom, headquarters of the southern Guangdong military region. Ziao Tiani looked at the announcement released by the United States.</p>
<p>His expression didn&#x27;t change much, but a sharp glint flashed in his eyes. Americans, do you want to make the whole world see our great Sia country lose face? You&#x27;re destined to be disappointed this time. Since you want to cause trouble, then I&#x27;ll give you a big one. Xiao Tiani&#x27;s lips curled into a cold smile. He has received authorization from the military.</p>
<p>In response to this joint military exercise between the US and the US, as long as warships cross the border, it was considered an invasion of territory. You can fire it directly. This is evident. This time the authorities also wanted to declare to the world the great SIA kingdom&#x27;s determination to defend its territory and sovereignty and the US is going to do a live broadcast. They simply assumed things would be the same as before.</p>
<p>Their warships entered and cruised around the territorial waters of the great sea kingdom. Then they left unharmed. This is to demonstrate the strength of their American navy. Only the US doesn&#x27;t know yet. The combat power of the great sea kingdom&#x27;s navy has increased dramatically.</p>
<p>It is no longer the weak navy it once was. A navy equipped with superpowered laser cannons. Whether it&#x27;s air defense or frontal attack, they can completely overwhelm the US Navy. This time, this might be a great opportunity to test the super laser cannon. How could Xiao Tiani possibly miss it? He turned to the staff officer beside him and said, &quot;Go and relay the order.</p>
<p>All warships, as long as the enemy invades our territorial waters.&quot; After three warnings, you are permitted to fire directly. A hint of excitement flashed in the staff officer&#x27;s eyes. Immediately straighten your back and respond loudly. Yes, commander. I&#x27;ll go and relay the order right away.</p>
<p>After saying that, he quickly turned around to give orders. South China Sea, a certain sea area. A type 055 destroyer. It is cruising at a low speed on the waves. The ship&#x27;s imposing hull contrasted sharply with the turquoise sea.</p>
<p>At this time, the warship remained silent. After receiving orders from his staff, Captain Jean Jun Feay, I got instantly excited. Very good. The commander has officially given the order. Open fire immediately if the US-led coalition fleet crosses the border.</p>
<p>As for three warnings, he completely ignored it. Given the nature of the US fleet, once they crossed the line, the so-called warnings had absolutely no effect. So, just fire. Upon hearing this, the vice captain next to him was also filled with excitement. Really, captain? Then wouldn&#x27;t we be able to directly destroy the enemy&#x27;s warships? Huh? It would be best if the Japanese warships cross the border.</p>
<p>When the time comes, we must make sure they are sunk in the South China Sea to commemorate our martyrs. As he spoke, a deep hatred flashed in the vice captain&#x27;s eyes. Other warships might be able to be punished lightly and let off the hook. But the Japanese warships are definitely out of the question. They must be made to sink.</p>
<p>Only in this way can we live up to the expectations of our martyrs. Jeang Junfi nodded, his eyes filled with hatred. That&#x27;s right. Well specifically target the Japanese warships. Then take them down the moment they show their heads.</p>
<p>The first maid added, &quot;Even without showing its face, it&#x27;s still a kill.&quot; Chapter 55. Military exercise begins. A famous scene featuring Choya appears. Time flies. November 11th will arrive soon.</p>
<p>A certain area of international waters in the South China Sea. The sea was calm and peaceful. The warships were lined up in a dense array. The USS Ford aircraft carrier like a mobile fortress stop in the very middle. The Isumo from the Kingdom of Sakura followed nearby.</p>
<p>The King Sajong ship of South Korea. The Indian aircraft carriers Vikrant and Vikramatia. Several French frigots. The Queen Elizabeth class destroyer of the British Empire. Count them carefully.</p>
<p>Five aircraft carriers. 25 destroyers. 30 frig. 10 submarines. a total of 70 ships.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 10 supply ships of various types. Several shipworn helicopters circled in the air. The Allied fleet stretched as far as the I could see. Its momentum is like the ocean waves surging and turbulent. On deck, coalition soldiers took photos with their cameras.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no sense of urgency in the drill. Look at this scene. The great SEA Kingdom must be terrified. An American soldier with a cigarette dangling from his lips patted his comrade on the shoulder. His companion looked at him with disdain.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not the first time. We&#x27;re used to it. It&#x27;s obvious. They are all veterans. They have participated in such joint military exercises more than once.</p>
<p>He has seen many big events. They all believe that the Great Sa Kingdom would remain the same as before, regardless of their transgressions. At most, they&#x27;ll just send warships to escort them. On the other side, a Japanese warship. The Japanese soldiers were even more arrogant than the American soldiers.</p>
<p>Yash, it&#x27;s finally starting. We must break into the territorial waters of the Great Sea Kingdom in a moment. Commander Kono said that whoever is the first to rush into the territorial waters of the Great Sea Kingdom will have their name put in the Yasakoni latrine. Our love rock is determined to be number one. Almost all the Japanese soldiers had fanaticism in their eyes.</p>
<p>They were incredibly excited, as if they&#x27;d been injected with adrenaline. They couldn&#x27;t wait to sail their warships into the territorial waters of the great Sia Kingdom. For them, having their names displayed in the Yasakuni shrine is the greatest honor. Not only were the soldiers of the Japanese army insane, South Korean soldiers were filled with arrogance. The Koreans are full of confidence in their King Sang warship.</p>
<p>They believe that apart from the USS Ford aircraft carrier, this is a different story. No other warship could compare to their King Saj Jong s ship at this time on the two aircraft carriers of India. The Indian naval soldiers eyes were filled with hatred. The great Sia kingdom must avenge that day. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>This time we must show the great Sia Kingdom how powerful we are. The Indian naval soldiers were gritting their teeth. Still harbor resentment over the tragic deaths of their border soldiers. Even the Philippines, they also deployed several dilapidated frigots to a certain sea area. They were waiting for an opportunity to get revenge.</p>
<p>The plan has already been discussed with the US-led coalition fleet. As long as they start taking action, the Allied fleet will cooperate. What the Allied fleet was unaware of was it was only a dozen nautical miles away from them. A warship from the Great Sea Kingdom with four buns on its head followed the Allied fleet. However, the radar on the Allied fleet did not detect anything.</p>
<p>At the same time, the global live broadcast was launched on time. Dozens of media outlets including CNN, the US, NHK, Japan, AFP, France, and Doine, China, broadcast the news simultaneously. The number of viewers in the live stream skyrocketed. American nizens in the CNN live stream were full of arrogance. My god, our allied fleet is so powerful.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Does the Great Sa Kingdom even have such a massive warship? I hope our fleet will sail directly into their territorial waters soon and let them know who the overlord is. President Otto is awesome. This time we&#x27;re going to utterly crush Great Sea. NHK live broadcast from Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese nizens were full of excitement. Yash. The Isumo is charging ahead. Great Sea Kingdom prepare to tremble. This time we will recreate the glory of the Greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere.</p>
<p>Starting today, our great cherry blossom country is back. It&#x27;s obvious. All Japanese nizens agree. They will definitely impress the whole world this time. They instilled fear in the world about their naval power.</p>
<p>On the other side, South Korean nizens went absolutely crazy. Damn it. Our King Sang s warship is the best in the world. Apart from the US fleet, our warships are unmatched. Upon seeing our king Si Jang s war worship, the warships of the great Sia kingdom automatically gave way.</p>
<p>Nizens from other countries watched the spectacle with interest. I post a few comments every now and then. They all wanted to see what kind of trouble the US-led coalition was up to this time. Is it possible that it could truly pose a certain threat to the great SEA Kingdom? at this time in the live broadcast room of the great Sia Kingdom. Netzens, however, remained calm, even offering a slightly sarcastic comment.</p>
<p>TSK tsk, &quot;We&#x27;re in the modern military age now, and you still think having more warships is useful. Go ahead and trespass into our territorial waters if you dare, and we&#x27;ll see if we fight you or not. Don&#x27;t back down. Especially you Japanese devils. You must stand up for yourselves.&quot; He he I hope to see an exceptionally grand fireworks display at sea today.</p>
<p>Almost all netizens in the great Sia Kingdom were extremely enthusiastic. Everyone was hoping the Allied forces would cross the border. At this time, a few rats hiding in the dark also came out to make sarcastic remarks. However, his account was quickly reported and banned by Chinese nizens. At the same time, the reaction of Chinese nizens.</p>
<p>This also broke the defenses of netizens in other countries. Nizens from various countries started arguing in the comment section. Stop bragging you Chinese. When the Allied forces enter our territorial waters, will you dare to make a move? An American nisan provoked. Don&#x27;t dare to make a move? What happened to the Philippines broken warship last time? Have you forgotten? A Chinese netisen retorted.</p>
<p>That was staged. Our Japanese warships aren&#x27;t afraid. A Japanese nizen interjected. Whether you&#x27;re scared or not isn&#x27;t something you can just say. I&#x27;ll show you what instant kill really means.</p>
<p>A netizen from DSA made a bold statement. In the comment section, various emojis and harsh words flooded the screen, causing a huge argument. No one is willing to submit to anyone else. But when it comes to online fighting power compared to other Chinese people, foreigners simply can&#x27;t compete. Many Chinese nizens immediately adopted the slang and taunts of the zoo, a derogatory term for people from the foreign nonsens were left speechless by the insults.</p>
<p>They were all so angry that their faces turned red just as the live stream was embroiled in a heated argument. Suddenly, a sound came through the public channel of the Allied fleet. It was Admiral Sweet, commander of the US fleet. He was dressed in a crisp military uniform, his chest adorned with medals, and spoke into the microphone in a loud yet arrogant voice. Dear viewers around the world, today our 8 nation coalition is conducting military exercises here to safeguard regional peace.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom has been disrupting regional peace recently, and today will be a day for them to learn a lesson. I hereby declare that from this moment forward, our fleet will. Stevie hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. A clear voice tinged with a local Dasha accent suddenly cut into the public channel. Hello.</p>
<p>Hello. Hello. Is Chuya here? Is Chua here? Please respond if you hear me. Please respond if you hear me. Chapter 56.</p>
<p>Four balls on my head. I&#x27;m the best in the world. The allied fleet stirwall was completely dumbfounded. Even the entire Allied fleet was stunned into silence. Even the viewers in the live stream, I heard that sudden intrusion.</p>
<p>The comment section seemed to have been paused. They all disappeared at once. It was as if the viewers in the live stream had suddenly lost their internet connection. A few seconds later, nizens from the great Sia Kingdom reacted immediately. Then the chat in the live stream went completely crazy.</p>
<p>Holy crap. If I heard correctly, I think I heard them looking for Chu Ya. Damn it. Did Charlotte time travel? I can&#x27;t take it anymore. My stomach is going to hurt from laughing.</p>
<p>What the hell is Chu Ya coming to the Allied fleet to find Shuya? In a short time, Chinese nizens flooded the screen with comments. Various humorous and sarcastic remarks emerged one after another. But at this moment, those foreign nisens felt as uncomfortable as if they had swallowed a dead fly. An American nizen commented, &quot;Fuck, why is Chinese appearing in the coalition channel?&quot; International nizens commented, &quot;Could it be that the Allied forces secretly invited the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s fleet?&quot; A Japanese nizen commented, &quot;Baka.&quot; Someone translated it. It says, &quot;Looking for a girl named Akia.&quot; South Korean nizens, holy crap, why would something so outrageous happen? Nizens from all eight countries questioned the coalition fleet.</p>
<p>Let them explain it clearly. Why is Chinese appearing in the coalition channel? He was also saying he wanted to find a girl named Chuya. They hope it&#x27;s just a prank by one of the coalition nations. Everyone awaited Stuart s explanation and the soldiers of the Allied fleet. They were still completely bewildered.</p>
<p>They had absolutely no idea what the sudden finding Shuya was all about. It&#x27;s unclear how this relates to the frenzied reaction from nizens in the great Sia Kingdom. At this moment, inside the Allied Fleet Command Center on the USS Ford aircraft carrier, the atmosphere was so heavy it seemed like it could drip water. Stevie had already come to his senses, his face ashen. He yelled at the communication soldier, &quot;Who? Who&#x27;s interrupting? Cut off the signal.&quot; He also believed it was a prank by people in their fleet.</p>
<p>But the signal men were already in a panic. Their voices trembled as they reported, &quot;Commander, it wasn&#x27;t us. We couldn&#x27;t detect the intruding model at all. The communications soldier frantically tried to operate the system only to find that there were no other signals at all. You guys aren&#x27;t playing a prank.</p>
<p>What is that? Stuart quickly came up with a possibility. It made him break out in a cold sweat instantly. Just then, the voice rang out again. Don&#x27;t panic everyone. I&#x27;ll play you a song to help you relax.</p>
<p>The next second on the public channel, suddenly the theme song from Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf started playing. Pleasant goat, beautiful goat, lazy goat, boiling goat. A cheerful melody. This left the soldiers of the Allied fleet even more bewildered. What? What song is this? It sounds pretty cheerful.</p>
<p>Damn it. I suddenly feel homesick. This is definitely a Chinese song. On the Isumo, Konotaro&#x27;s face was ashen as he roared. Baka, this is a children&#x27;s song from the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>You bastard. Commanders from other countries began to panic. Damn it. Why are there children&#x27;s songs from the Great Sea Kingdom appearing here? Steuart, why aren&#x27;t you getting someone to investigate? Damn it. Our channel has been invaded by the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Why haven&#x27;t we found the source of the signal yet? Turn on your worships radar and track down the Great Sea Kingdoms warship. The coalition&#x27;s public channel was hacked. It happened while it was being broadcast live to the entire world. This is an utter disgrace. Veins bulged on Stuart&#x27;s forehead.</p>
<p>He shouted horsely into the public channel. Attention all. Immediately activate the highest level of alert. All ship radars, turn on full power. We must find this damned intruder.</p>
<p>Taro Kono from the Sakura Kingdom. Steward, what are you saying? We only heard nursery rhymes. South Korean fleet commander. Damn it. It&#x27;s all children&#x27;s songs.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t hear anything at all. Indian fleet commander.  The other side is interfering with our public affairs. Stevie received no response and his face grew even darker.  Switch to an encrypted channel right now.</p>
<p>At the same time, the internet in the great Sia Kingdom has already exploded. Netzens were as excited as if it were Chinese New Year with all sorts of jokes and memes flooding the internet. Holy crap. Who is this? That&#x27;s amazing. Pleasant Goat and Big Wolf.</p>
<p>Huh? I give this move a perfect score. The coalition forces must be bewildered. They probably don&#x27;t even know where the signal came from. American nizens felt humiliated. Are all the coalition commanders incompetent? Even their military channels were hacked.</p>
<p>Japanese nizens were outraged. Baka, the great SEA Kingdom is despicable, resorting to such low-level tactics to disgust people. Childish, is that your food? I&#x27;m playing nursery rhymes for you so that your mothers will call you home for dinner. Netzens on Desa immediately started making fun of the meme. Faced with ridicule from netizens of the great SA kingdom, from the allied nations were filled with resentment and anger.</p>
<p>But there was no way to refute it. They all turned their anger towards the coalition commander. They were cursing sweet in the live chat. Sweet must give them an explanation. At this moment, the coalition has switched to an encrypted channel.</p>
<p>The sound of the nursery rhyme finally disappeared. Sweet breathed a sigh of relief and his expression improved slightly, but his face remained gloomy. He prepared to repeat the command he had just given. Attention all. Sudden that voice came through the encrypted channel again.</p>
<p>Why did you change the channel? Did you think the song you just heard wasn&#x27;t good? Then I&#x27;ll change it for you. Then pleasant music started playing again in the encrypted channel. Bobo Chicken, Bobo Chicken, one you on a skewer of Bobo Chicken. That familiar melody with a unique playful charm. It echoed freely in the encrypted channel moment.</p>
<p>The live stream room of the Great Sa Kingdom was in an uproar once again. Huh, that was an amazing move. The coalition must be completely dumbfounded right now. Bo chicken. This song choice is brilliant.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s practically a mockery of the Allied forces. When did our navy become so powerful? Awesome. Foreign nitizens remain silent. They dared not send any more bullet comments. They were afraid of being ridiculed or mocked.</p>
<p>Allied fleet. The soldiers on the warship were once again dumbfounded. The sudden music was like a demonic blast. What? What song is this? It sounds really catchy. A coalition soldier asked curiously.</p>
<p>It sounds like a street food song from the great Sea Kingdom. Another soldier replied uncertainly. They had never heard this kind of music before, but its unique rhythm and lyrics are captivating. It made them unable to resist humming along. Stevie was taken aback for a moment.</p>
<p>He immediately flew into a rage. Damn. Great Xiao warships. Come out if you dare. His face was so ashen it defied description.</p>
<p>He felt as if he were being manipulated by an invisible hand. Anger and humiliation drove him to a violent outburst. On the other side, Konotaro was on the verge of collapse at this point. He shouted into the communicator. Baka, what is this? Steuart, you have to give us an explanation.</p>
<p>Other commanders also raised questions. Stuart did not respond. He stared intently at the communication soldier. I hope to get even the slightest bit of good news from them, but the signalmen just shook their heads helplessly, indicating that they were powerless to help either. Commander, we we can&#x27;t find the source of the signal at all.</p>
<p>A communication soldier said, his voice trembling with tears. Stuart took a deep breath. Try to calm yourself down. He knew that now was not the time to lose his temper. We must find a solution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>He calmed himself down and gave the order directly. I hereby declare the military exercise officially commence. The first mission of the military exercise is to capture local warships alive. All fleets commence operations. Sweet had only one goal.</p>
<p>Whoever it is, we must find them under the guise of military exercises. Even if something goes wrong in the end, he can explain it away. Chapter 57. The Japanese fleet is about to enter the village. In the encrypted channel, the melody of Bull Boy G, a type of Sichuan hot pot chicken, is still playing on repeat.</p>
<p>Stuart&#x27;s roar was completely drowned out. He ripped off his headphones and slammed them onto the control panel. In the command room, the light from the instrument panel reflected on his ashen face. His wrinkles were furrowed and his fists were clenched so tightly that his knuckles turned white. All ships, turn the radar power to maximum.</p>
<p>Helicopters take off for patrol. Submerge the submarine and expand the search area. Strive roar pierced through the command room. The soldiers outside the door were startled. He was frantically relaying orders.</p>
<p>Soon, the Allied fleet was in complete disarray. The destroyer&#x27;s radar antennas were spinning wildly. The shiporn helicopter roared into the sky, its propellers whipping up towering waves. Like ghosts, submarines silently slip into the deep sea. Everyone had only one goal, to find the source of that provocative signal.</p>
<p>On the aircraft carrier, Izzumo from Japan. Konotaro stared at the communicator, his face terribly grim. Baka, you scum of the great Sia Kingdom. He suddenly kicked over the chair next to him. The clanging of metal echoed shrilly in the command room.</p>
<p>The old nursery rhymes. The new snack songs. They&#x27;re treating our coalition forces like monkeys. Tarokono s eyes were bloodshot. Suddenly, as if he had thought of something, a sinister smile curled at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>Pass down the order. The fleet has quietly changed course. Move towards the territorial waters of the great Sia Kingdom. As long as we break in first, that way the whole world can see how amazing Japan is. The agitant was stunned.</p>
<p>Commander, isn&#x27;t this too risky? An adventure? Konaro sneered. Now is the best opportunity. The coalition forces are all searching for the signal source. Nobody will notice us once we break into our territorial waters. The credit will be ours.</p>
<p>The agitant dared not persuade him any further and immediately went to relay the order. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Japanese fleet secretly changed course. They moved slowly toward the South China Sea of the Great Sea Kingdom. White House OP watched the live stream, trembling with rage. He smashed the coffee cup on the ground.</p>
<p>a bunch of idiots. 70 warships. Not a single signal source can be found. He watched the Bobo chicken video playing on a loop on the screen. He was so angry that his whole body was trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Pete, are you guys in the war department just sitting around doing nothing? Others are hacking into our military channels and you still can&#x27;t find them. Use all the satellites. Even if we have to turn the South China Sea upside down, we&#x27;ll find that damned warship. Defense Secretary Pitt stood to the side, his face grim. Mr.</p>
<p>President, the satellites are already searching at full capacity. But the other party signal is too well concealed and we haven&#x27;t detected it yet. Didn&#x27;t find anything? Otep roared. Then what were you doing? How dare the great Sia Kingdom provoke us like this? If we don&#x27;t find them and teach them a lesson, does the US even care about its reputation? Pete nodded slightly. Understood.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll have them build it. Otep took a deep breath, his eyes turning sinister. Tell Stuart. If he can&#x27;t be found, he shouldn&#x27;t come back. Yes, Pete replied, then left with a grim expression.</p>
<p>Prime Minister&#x27;s office of the three Arab countries. Demo the immortal watched the live stream and was so angry that his beard stood on end. Damn the great Sia Kingdom. How dare you be so arrogant? Aren&#x27;t you afraid that our allied fleet will find the warships location and destroy it? He couldn&#x27;t understand it. The Great Sa Kingdom acquires such advanced warships.</p>
<p>They were able to move freely within their allied fleet. This demonstrates just how terrifyingly well the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s warships concealed their signals, even surpassing the US. If that&#x27;s the case, are there other warships hidden nearby? The more Demo the Immortal thought about it, the more panicked he became. No, we can&#x27;t let our aircraft carrier be at the forefront anymore. We must slowly retreat to the rear of the fleet.</p>
<p>Those two aircraft carriers are the lifeblood of India. If something unexpected happens, torn apart by all those Indians back home as prime minister. The border issue had only just been resolved at a great cost. If the aircraft carrier has another problem, that was truly the end of his term as prime minister. This time, let other countries steal the spotlight first.</p>
<p>He immediately picked up the phone and dialed the Navy headquarters. Let our carrier battle group secretly move to the outer perimeter of the combined fleet, away from the waters of the great Sia Kingdom. The naval commander on the other end of the phone was stunned. Prime Minister, how do we demonstrate our strength? Show off my ass. Old immortal demo sneered.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you know the situation with our aircraft carrier? Until that ghost ship of the great Sia Kingdom is found. It&#x27;s a ticking time bomb. Who knows when or where they&#x27;ll appear? We need to be more cautious. Yes. After hanging up the phone, Demolian stared at the screen.</p>
<p>He prayed that his two aircraft carriers would return unharmed. It was all just for show. If something happens, then their Indian country would truly become a laughingstock of the whole world. The land of cherry blossoms. Prime Minister Jiro Kishida already knew about Taro Kono s actions.</p>
<p>Yoshi Konokuan has good comprehension. We know that now is the perfect time to intrude into the South China Sea. This time, our Sakura nation is destined to become great again. He was very satisfied with Taro Kono esco covert actions. Although he was angry that the allied forces channel was being mocked by the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>But as long as we can get into the territorial waters of the great sea kingdom for a stroll, all anger will dissipate. The prime minister is wise. This time our cherry blossom country will definitely impress the whole world. The great sia kingdom is still a place where our cherry blossom kingdom can come and go as it pleases. The defense minister complimented.</p>
<p>Kishida Jiro nodded, his eyes filled with greed and ambition. He turned and looked at the map on the wall. His fingers gently traced the border of the great Sea Kingdom in the South China Sea. I recall the glory of our ancestors in Japan. Jiro Kishida dreamed of restoring Japan to its former glory and prosperity.</p>
<p>This joint military exercise is just the beginning. Soon their cherry blossom country will gradually spread outwards. No one can stop the cherry blossom nation from dominating the ocean once again. The Great Sea Kingdom, Southern GuangDong Military Region Headquarters. Xiao Tiani watched the live stream, grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>I almost dropped the teacup in my hand. Haha, great job. That was so satisfying. Who is the captain of ship 815? He deserves a major commendation this time. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>It really satisfies. The staff officer next to him nodded with a smile. However, it seems that the Japanese fleet is secretly moving towards our territorial waters. Ziao Tiani smile vanished instantly and his eyes sharpened. Huh? They actually dared to come.</p>
<p>Pass down the order. All warships are on high alert. As long as those Japanese warships dare to cross the border. No warning. Open fire.</p>
<p>The staff officer stood at attention and saluted. Yes, sir. Xiaoani looked back at the screen, a cold smile curling at the corner of his mouth. Whether it&#x27;s the US or Japan, how dare you cause trouble on our turf. Let them never leave alive.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. The staff officer replied and then went to give the order. Chapter 58. The brat fleet is invading. Fire Siaki Lynch&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>He has just finished writing a document on the key technologies of the seventh generation aerospace fighter. Take a break and stretch. It suddenly occurred to me that the US-led coalition fleet has already begun operations. So, I turned on my computer and went into the live stream. moment when the melody of Bobo chicken begins.</p>
<p>Lynchin was a little confused. What&#x27;s going on? What happened to the promised military exercises? Immediately, he started reading the comments in the live stream. He quickly understood what was going on. Yeah, the Navy really knows how to play games. Lynchin smiled happily.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so vivid. While the US and Soviet Union were conducting joint military exercises, the Chinese Navy went to serve Bo, a type of Sichuan hot pot chicken. It&#x27;s hilarious just thinking about it. This move deserves full marks. It&#x27;s even more painful than destroying their warships.</p>
<p>Lyn Shan continued watching and swiped through the bullet comments of netzens and Da almost overflowed the screen. Huh? Look at Stevie&#x27;s face. It looks like he&#x27;s swallowed a fly. Konotaro, stop kicking the chair. If you&#x27;ve got the guts, come at us.</p>
<p>By the way, has anyone noticed the Japanese fleet? It seems to be moving towards the South China Sea. The moment this comment appeared, it was instantly promoted to the top of the trending comments. Holy crap, it&#x27;s true. The Japanese fleet is on the wrong course. You bastard trying to raid our base.</p>
<p>You think the coalition is in disarray and nobody&#x27;s watching? Those little devils will never change their nature. Humph. Hopefully, this trip to the Navy will give him an unforgettable memory. Looking at the comments, Lynshin felt a sense of anticipation. You little devils, you absolutely must come in.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Navy won&#x27;t have an excuse to fire. I watched for a while. Lynchin then put the personal computer aside. Then I continued working on my work computer. On the other side, foreign nizens got anxious and the live chat exploded with arguments.</p>
<p>Baka, we&#x27;re just making a normal course adjustment. DA nizens stopped spreading rumors. The joint military exercises include freedom of navigation. You have no evidence at all. You&#x27;re just afraid of Japan.</p>
<p>Dion nizens directly retorted. Normal adjustment. Moving towards our territorial waters. Do you think we&#x27;re blind? Freedom of navigation? Dare to cross the line and try it. Evidence.</p>
<p>Just wait. You&#x27;ll see fireworks later. The live stream chat was in an uproar. Netzens from eight countries couldn&#x27;t win the argument against netzens from the great Sea Kingdom. South China Sea.</p>
<p>The 815A reconnaissance ship like a silent cheetah cruised slowly on the sea. Captain Shinfong stared at the radar screen. The red dots above show the Japanese fleet. Keep up. Keep a safe distance and don&#x27;t get spotted.</p>
<p>At the same time, notify the other brother ships to move closer to the Japanese warships. The first mate nodded. Okay. Captain Shinfong looked at the Japanese fleet, which consisted of 15 warships. His eyes were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>You little devils, you absolutely must not back down, otherwise we&#x27;ll lose our first class merit this time. On the radar screen, the Japanese fleet is becoming increasingly erratic and the direction was precisely the territorial waters of the Great Sea Kingdom. On the other side, after receiving the message, Captain Jang Jun Feay of the Type055 destroyer. I got excited instantly. Good.</p>
<p>Finally, the Japanese Devils have delivered themselves to our doorstep. Change course immediately to the left in the XXXC area. Let the other brother ships slowly cruise over. Let the Japanese devils in and then fight them so they don&#x27;t get away. Received, the vice captain exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>The order has been issued. All the soldiers were eager to get started. His eyes gleamed with a fierce fighting spirit. If we could destroy one of those Japanese warships, he will definitely make a great contribution. If all 15 warships are destroyed, they will definitely receive a collective first class merit.</p>
<p>At that time, we can simply open a separate page for the family genealogy. The thought alone excites the soldiers of the Isumo. Taro Kono held a telescope and stared at the distant sea. How far are we from the great Sia territorial waters? The agitant glanced at the navigation system. Commander, 20 nautical miles to go.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re expected to enter in half an hour. Konotaro&#x27;s lips curled into a sinister smile. Very good. Order the fleet to speed up. He put down his binoculars and shouted into the communicator.</p>
<p>Attention all, prepare to enter the territorial waters of Great Sya. Let the whole world see how powerful we are. Japanese soldiers on the warship instantly erupted in cheers. Waving flags and cheering, &quot;Yoshi! Charge into the territorial waters of Great Sia. The Japanese fleet is getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>The Azumo was the first to cross that invisible boundary and enter the territorial waters of the Great Sea.&quot; Taro Kono stood on the deck, raising his binoculars and looking around. The sea was calm with no warships in sight, not even patrol boats. He paused for a moment, then burst into laughter. Haha, the great Sea Kingdom is afraid. They don&#x27;t even dare to send a single person.</p>
<p>The Agitan also got excited. The commander is wise. They must be afraid of our fleet and dare not come out. Taro Kono pulled out his communicator and shouted into the Allied Forces channel. I am Taro Kono.</p>
<p>The Japanese fleet has entered the territorial waters of Great Sea. The Great Sa Kingdom has made no response. We have won. The coalition channel went silent instantly. Upon hearing this, Stuart trembled with rage.</p>
<p>That idiot Taro Kono. He actually crossed the boundary without permission. Damn it. You guys come back right now. Otherwise, you will bear all the consequences.</p>
<p>Stuart roared into the communicator. Those idiots in Japan, they actually dared to directly invade the territorial waters of the great Sia Kingdom. Moreover, this was all without finding the ghost ship. What&#x27;s the difference between this and sending someone to their death? But Tarono did not respond to Steuart at all, huh? You want us to back out? No way. The Great Sea Kingdom wouldn&#x27;t dare show up.</p>
<p>So, what&#x27;s there to worry about? We&#x27;ll take a trip around the South China Sea and then slowly head back. Keep going. Let the great Sia Kingdom know that we, the Cherry Blossom Kingdom, can come and go as we please. At this time, the Japanese fleet, the Japanese soldiers went completely mad. Some were taking pictures.</p>
<p>Some people were pointing their middle fingers towards the direction of Dashia. They all assumed that the Great Sa Kingdom wouldn&#x27;t dare to stop them. After all, the coalition forces were still nearby. At the same time, the viewers in the live stream were completely excited. A nizen from Japan commented, &quot;Yash, did you all see that? The people of Great Sa are afraid of our great Sakura Empire.&quot; A South Korean nizen commented, &quot;Damn it, why did Japan beat us to it? Where are our warships?&quot; An American nizen commented, &quot;My god, Japan is a bunch of mad dogs.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t they afraid of China taking action?&quot; Viewers from other countries were watching the live stream intently. I was afraid of missing the most exciting moment and nizens from the Great Sea Kingdom. I was also very excited at that moment. Holy crap, the Japanese devils actually got in quick. Our Type 055 destroyer will bomb it.</p>
<p>We absolutely cannot let those bastards escape this time. We must wipe them out. I&#x27;m starting to record the screen. I&#x27;m determined to capture the most exciting moment. All the people of the Great Sea Kingdom began to spread the news.</p>
<p>Everyone eagerly awaited the arrival of the Great Sea Navy. on the other side. 055 drive up. The Japanese fleet getting closer and closer. Soon they were only 20 nautical miles away from the Japanese warship.</p>
<p>Jeang Junf felt the time was right and immediately gave the order. All warships, listen to my command. Aim at the Japanese warships. Laser cannon, begin charging. Chapter 59.</p>
<p>Sinking the Izumo aircraft carrier. The prime minister&#x27;s residence in the land of cherry blossoms. The crystal chandelier was dazzlingly bright. Jiro Kishida holds up a wine glass. Yoshi Konokuan certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint us.</p>
<p>He raised his glass into the air, his voice arrogant and excited. The surrounding executives raised their glasses in agreement. The prime minister is wise. The great Sa Kingdom really doesn&#x27;t dare to make a move. Our fleet intruded into our territorial waters, and they didn&#x27;t even dare to show their shadow.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Taro Yamamoto downed his drink in one gulp and made outrageous remarks. This is just the beginning. Next, our fleet will be permanently stationed in the territorial waters of the Great Sea Kingdom to restore the glory of the Greater East Asia co-rossperity sphere. All the high-ranking officials in Japan nodded in approval. Some people even took out their phones and took pictures of the Izumo in the live broadcast.</p>
<p>Quick, take a picture. This is a glorious moment for our Sakura country. Send it out. Let the whole world see how powerful we are. The entire prime minister&#x27;s residence was like a pack of mad dogs having a wild party.</p>
<p>But they never dreamed that the isumo shown in the live broadcast was about to be sunk. The US, the White House oped the live broadcast with a furoughed brow. The land of cherry blossoms. They want to break free from our control. He pointed to the live stream on the screen, speculating about the intentions behind Japan&#x27;s unauthorized actions.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pit stood by, also clearly displeased. President, it seems that Japan has some ideas. You have ideas, huh? OTEP was full of disdain. They don&#x27;t really think the Great Sa Kingdom will stand idly by, do they? Or do they feel they have the leverage to confront us? Although OTP wanted to use the military exercises to coersse the great SIA kingdom into negotiating with them, but we will never underestimate the great SIA kingdom&#x27;s determination to defend its territory. So many clashes.</p>
<p>The Americans always retreat after a single contact. We will absolutely not completely provoke the Great Sa Kingdom. That&#x27;s why the US has always managed to escape and scathe. But this time it was Japan s unauthorized action. This is likely to offend the Great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>The outcome depends on the determination of the Great Sea Kingdom. Pete blinked. But right now, the Great Sa Kingdom hasn&#x27;t made a move. Could it be that they really don&#x27;t dare to go to war? It&#x27;s more frightening if there&#x27;s no reaction. OTP stared intently at the screen.</p>
<p>If the Great Sa Kingdom publicly condemns it, then it means everything is fine. If the Great Sea Kingdom remains silent, it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re preparing something big. He paused, then said, &quot;Seriously, contact Strive immediately. Have him order our aircraft carrier fleet to absolutely not enter the territorial waters of the great Sia Kingdom. If the Japanese fleet gets into trouble, send warships from other countries to rescue it.</p>
<p>His only task is to ensure the safety of the US fleet. As for the lives of teammates, they&#x27;re just there to be sacrificed. Yes, Mr. President. Pete nodded slightly and turned to relay the order.</p>
<p>OTP stared at the Izumo on the screen, his eyes filled with wisdom. He had a premonition that something was going to happen to the Isumo from Japan. South China Sea, the bridge control room of an American aircraft carrier. After receiving the order, sweet fell into deep thought. It seems that headquarters has received some information.</p>
<p>Safety first. Let&#x27;s retreat a bit. After thinking it through, he then began issuing orders to all of the US warships. Tell them to retreat secretly. We must not alert the other fleets.</p>
<p>They are taking the same actions as the US. There are also two aircraft carriers from India. Only the South Korean warships are still secretly heading towards the territorial waters of the great SA kingdom. On the other side, command room of type055 destroyer. Reporting.</p>
<p>Captain laser cannon fully charged. The soldier excitedly reported. Jeang Jun Fay&#x27;s eyes sharpened. A glint of cold light flashing within them. He stared intently at the arrogant Isumo aircraft carrier on the screen.</p>
<p>All warships, take aim at the Isumo. Fire. The words had barely left his mouth. The silver white laser cannon on the bow of the ship suddenly lit up with a blinding blue light. A slender yet incredibly sharp beam of light instantly pierced the sky.</p>
<p>As the beam of light swept across the sea, the seaater was instantly evaporated, leaving a trail of white mist. The speed is so fast that it is invisible to the naked eye. On the deck of the Iumo, Tarokono, holding up his binoculars, was still laughing wildly. Haha, it seems the great Sia Kingdom is truly afraid. We&#x27;ve been in their territorial waters for over 10 minutes, and we haven&#x27;t dared to make a single move.</p>
<p>His agitant beside him also chuckled sinisterly and said in a lewd tone, &quot;Commander, should we cruise around our territorial waters a few more times?&quot; Taro Kono nodded, about to speak. Sudden, a blue light suddenly appeared. What is that? He looked up instinctively. The next second sizzle. The top of the bridge in the command center was vaporized just like molten iron.</p>
<p>It continued to drop scalding hot debris accompanied by a pungent burnt smell. Kono sman maniacal laughter froze instantly and he scrambled out of the command room. Baka, what&#x27;s going on? He roared, his voice distorted. The surrounding soldiers panicked as well. The Japanese soldiers who were cheering just moments ago are now running around like headless flies.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s an attack. We&#x27;ve been attacked. Damn it. It&#x27;s a laser cannon. Could it be that the great Sia Kingdom has launched an attack on us? Chaos instantly engulfed the entire Isumo.</p>
<p>Konotaro&#x27;s face instantly darkened, and he urgently issued an order. Quickly order all warships to combat readiness and permit free movement. But before he could finish speaking, the second laser beam struck the Isumos engine room. Boom! The power compartment exploded directly under the high temperature of the laser cannon. In an instant, the entire power compartment was destroyed.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers inside were blown to pieces. Those hit by the laser were instantly vaporized. The warship lost power instantly and began to drift on the sea. Baka, how dare the great Sia Kingdom? Why did they launch the attack without any warning? Do they want to start a full-scale war? Konoaro was so angry that he flew into a rage and veins bulged on his forehead, but he doesn&#x27;t seem to think about it. They illegally sailed their warships into another country&#x27;s territorial waters.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this just an undeclared war? Commander, what do we do now? The agitant ran up to Konotaro and asked. Konotaro gritted his teeth and said fiercely, &quot;Request support from the Allied fleet immediately. Let them send warships to rescue us.&quot; Just then, the third beam of light hit the ammunition depot directly. Moment the ammunition depot directly triggered the secondary explosion. Boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>A series of explosions resounded throughout the entire sea area. The entire Isumo was blown away from the sea. Then it crashed back into the sea, creating a huge splash. The aircraft carrier broke in the middle. The Japanese soldiers on the deck were thrown directly into the sea.</p>
<p>Ah, help someone. Please save us. Taro Kono managed to grab hold of the command room door frame, preventing him from falling into the sea in vain, but he was so frightened that his face turned ashen. It&#x27;s over. The Great Sa Kingdom is not afraid at all.</p>
<p>Instead, they were just waiting for us to come to our deaths. This moment, Kono finally understood. He finally understood why the great Sia Kingdom had allowed them to enter the South China Sea. So, it was all for the purpose of eliminating them. Great Sa Kingdom, you are truly ruthless.</p>
<p>Kono Taro hadn&#x27;t finished speaking yet. Another laser beam hit the command center directly. Boom. The command center collapsed. Taro Kono was hit by the laser and instantly vaporized, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>At this time, the Isumo tilted even more. Another laser beam struck the keel of the Isumo. Snap! The warship&#x27;s keel broke completely. The Isumo began to sink rapidly and the soldiers on deck fell into the sea one after another. The Isumo class helicopter carrier, a source of great pride for Japan.</p>
<p>It was sunk in just one minute. Type055 destroyer command tower. Jean Junfi looked at the sinking Izumo and took out his walkie-talkie. Reporting to Commander Xiao, the Isumo has been sunk. Ziao Tianis excited voice came through the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>Good. Well done. Continue to destroy all the Japanese warships. Remember, not a single one can escape or you will be held responsible. I guarantee I&#x27;ll complete the mission.</p>
<p>Jean Jun Feay instinctively stood at attention and responded seriously. Chapter 60. Complete destruction. The world is in an uproar. Command room of type 055 destroyer.</p>
<p>After receiving another order from Ziao Tiani Jean Jun Fei. The order was relayed directly to the other sister ships. Attention all. The commander has given a death order. All the Japanese warships must be destroyed.</p>
<p>Lock on the iron destroyer. Receive. The laser cannons on the bows of all the warships lit up with blue light again. It&#x27;s even more glaring than before. Fire.</p>
<p>A beam of light pierced the air. White fog rose again over the sea. At this time, after the Japanese warships saw the Isumo sunk, they were all terrified. Quickly reverse immediately. The great SEA Kingdom has launched an attack.</p>
<p>Retreat immediately. They considered rebelling. However, due to interference from the 815A ship, it was unable to lock onto the warships of the Great Sea Kingdom. There is only one way out. Retreat.</p>
<p>The remaining 14 Japanese frigots and destroyers frantically reversed. Turn the engine to maximum power. On the iron, all the Japanese soldiers were filled with panic. They never dreamed of this. The Great Sa Kingdom will really open fire.</p>
<p>And in such a short time, they destroyed their aircraft carrier, Izzumo. The Great Sea Kingdom is terrifying. Quick, turn the engine up to full power. The captain of the Love Rock was filled with fear. It&#x27;s a pity.</p>
<p>No matter how fast they are, can they be faster than a laser? The next second, boom. The IN was directly hit by 40 laser beams. Sizzle, snap, boom. The sound of the keel breaking could be heard across the sea. Less than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>This Congo class destroyer sank in the South China Sea. This scene, it terrified the other Japanese warships. This This is impossible. How could the weapons of the Great Sea Kingdom be so terrifying? While the Japanese soldiers were still in a state of panic, Jeang Junf gave another order. Next, the Moami class destroyer.</p>
<p>Moment. Another ship has been sunk. The laser cannons never stop. Blue light flashed repeatedly. Boom.</p>
<p>Boom. Boom. The sound of explosions echoed across the sea. One after another, Japanese destroyers were blown up. Some broken too, some exploded directly.</p>
<p>The sea was covered with floating debris. The Japanese soldier who fell into the water struggled in the sea. No one came to the rescue. This is the price they paid for intruding into the territorial waters of the great Sea Kingdom. The first mate stared at the screen, his voice trembling but excited.</p>
<p>Captain, eight ships have already sunk. Jeang Junfi nodded, his gaze remaining fixed. Keep going. Six more ships to go. Let them know what happens when they trespass on the territorial waters of our great Sea.</p>
<p>South China Sea, a certain area of international waters. The bridge control room of an American aircraft carrier. The communication soldier. His face filled with panic and his voice trembling, reported, &quot;Commander. The Isumo from Japan has sunk and their love rock also sank.</p>
<p>What?&quot; Sweet exclaimed in shock. Are you sure? Confirmed. The communication soldier&#x27;s face turned deathly pale. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s the Great Sa Kingdom using laser cannons. The Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannon sank the Isumo in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Right now, they are still pursuing other Japanese warships. Upon hearing this, Sweet felt a chill run down his spine. I recalled the order that headquarters had just given me. Fortunately, he carried it out completely. Thank goodness I made it out.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#x27;t retreated just now, could we be the ones sinking now? The agitant beside him also panicked. Commander, the laser cannons of the great Sea Kingdom are terrifying. Can our aircraft carrier withstand this? Sweet didn&#x27;t say anything, staring at the direction of the South China Sea on the screen. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes. He had previously thought that the Great Sa Kingdom wouldn&#x27;t dare to make a move.</p>
<p>I only found out now. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m afraid. They are waiting for an opportunity. Wait until the Japanese invade. Then we&#x27;ll strike hard.</p>
<p>Madmen, these madmen from the Great Sea Kingdom. He suddenly roared. Quick, make our fleet retreat again. Get as far away from the Great Sia&#x27;s territorial waters as possible. The farther the better.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get caught in the crossfire. Global live stream. It completely exploded. The comments were like thick sesame paste. The excitement of netizens from the great Sea Kingdom is practically overflowing the screen.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Our parents really stepped in to teach those Japanese devils a lesson. Awesome. They sank the Japanese with a single strike. I had considered taking action, but I didn&#x27;t expect mom to go all out like this.</p>
<p>Our naval brothers have done a great service this time. They deserve a separate page in the family tree. Well done. This is what our great SA should be like. Weren&#x27;t Japanese nizens very arrogant before? Why are they silent now? They saw the Japanese warships being sunk.</p>
<p>The entire population of the great Sia Kingdom was in a frenzy of celebration. So many years, the day has finally come. That exhilarating feeling of getting revenge. Like a surging tide, it churned in the hearts of every person in the great Sia Kingdom. People spread the news throughout the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>Their faces beamed with pride and excitement. Although it only sank a worship, but its extraordinary significance can only be understood by the people of the great Sia Kingdom. the entire Great Sea Kingdom. Cheers and jubilation could be seen everywhere. Some people even set off firecrackers and fireworks to celebrate.</p>
<p>On the other side, the land of cherry blossoms. The Japanese were completely devastated. Impossible. This can&#x27;t be true. How could the Isumo sink? Baka, this must be the Great Sa Kingdom infiltrating our network and playing AI generated videos.</p>
<p>No, the Great Sea Kingdom has really made its move. Why? Why does the great Sea Kingdom dare to actually attack? Where are the Allied forces? Why aren&#x27;t they coming to our aid? Where&#x27;s the US? Didn&#x27;t we agree to do joint military exercises? Why are they just watching us get attacked? Japanese nizens were completely devastated. They could not accept the fact that the Isumo had been sunk. That&#x27;s the pride of their cherry blossom country. However, it was sunk in the territorial waters of the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Some people started swearing. They accused the Great Sa Kingdom of committing crimes. They criticized the US for not helping. He called Konotara stupid. Finally, after a while of cursing, he fell silent.</p>
<p>All that remains is the despair of it&#x27;s over and it&#x27;s gone. On the other side, South Korean nizens. I was completely terrified. Previously, people were even shouting in the comments, &quot;Why did Japan beat us to it? Now they&#x27;ve all shut up.&quot; Occasionally, a few comments appeared, all expressing panic. Damn it.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom is too ruthless. They actually opened fire directly. Luckily, our warships didn&#x27;t rush in. Otherwise, we would be the ones sinking. Now, we used to think that the Great Sea wouldn&#x27;t dare to attack, but now it seems we were overthinking it.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t mess with the Great Sa Kingdom. Seriously, don&#x27;t mess with it. Shock from American nizens. My god, what kind of weapon is that? A laser cannon? How can it be so powerful? Sinking an aircraft carrier in 1 minute. When did the Great Sea Kingdom become so powerful? Can our USS Ford withstand this kind of attack? We used to think the Allied forces could suppress Great Sea, but now it seems we were too arrogant.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t President Ot say that Great Sea was a clown? Who is the clown? Nizens from other countries were immediately in an uproar. My god, the Great Sa Kingdom has risen to power. From now on, no one will dare to trespass in the South China Sea, right? Is America&#x27;s hijgemony coming to an end? The laser cannon technology of the great Sia Kingdom is too advanced. Luckily, our country didn&#x27;t join the coalition forces. Otherwise, we&#x27;d be in big trouble now.</p>
<p>South China Sea, the last Japanese destroyer. The ammunition depot was hit by a laser cannon. Boom. The massive explosion sent water splashing dozens of meters high. The ship was instantly torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Command room of Type 055 Destroyer. The vice captain&#x27;s voice was trembling with excitement. Captain, they&#x27;ve all been sunk. All 15 Japanese warships are gone. Chapter 61.</p>
<p>Forbidden zone of the South China Sea. Trespassing is prohibited. Southern GuangDong military region headquarters. Xiao Tiani holding the phone exclaimed in surprise. What did you say? 15 ships all sunk.</p>
<p>Jeang Jun&#x27;s excited voice came through the phone. Commander, we have successfully completed our mission. All the Japanese warships have been destroyed. Good, good, good. Xiao Tiani was so excited that he slapped his thigh.</p>
<p>That was  awesome. Finally, we&#x27;ve dealt with those little devils. Haha. From now on, the South China Sea will be a no-go zone for foreign warships. Anyone who comes here will die.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ziao Tiani was as excited as a child, completely lacking the dignity of a major military region commander. Faced with this good news, any normal person from Dao would be unable to resist feeling excited. No matter the position, there are no exceptions unless they are colonists. Pass down the order. All warships shall remain on alert and continue to monitor the surrounding waters.</p>
<p>No matter which country&#x27;s warships they are, if they dare to cross the line, open fire immediately. Receive. The response from the walkie-talkie was firm and resounding. Ziao Tiani hung up the phone, his face still beaming with excitement. Seeing the commander so excited, the staff officer standing nearby could not hide his excitement and quickly said, &quot;Commander, this victory is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Those little devils used to always come to our East China Sea to cause trouble. Let&#x27;s see if they dare to do it again.&quot; Xiao Tiani nodded. That&#x27;s right. After this, let&#x27;s see who dares to cause trouble around us. This sword showdown was perfect.</p>
<p>According to their plan, if an American carrier strike group crosses the line, just knock the opponent back. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers were at the forefront. That would definitely be a matter of revenge, settling scores, and seeking redress. How could I possibly miss such a rare opportunity? After the initial excitement subsided, Ziao Tiani quickly dialed General Cenangs number. The capital city military headquarters conference room.</p>
<p>General had just finished a combat meeting when his work phone rang. He picked it up and saw that it was from Zhaoani, so he answered it. Instantly, Zhaoanis excited voice could be heard. Old Jang, this is fantastic news. We sank all 15 warships of the Japanese Empire.</p>
<p>What? General Jeang was stunned and hurriedly asked, &quot;Say that again, 15 ships, including the Isumo.&quot; That&#x27;s right. Chief Designer Lynn&#x27;s laser cannon is amazing. It can take down warships as easily as slicing a watermelon. Great. Excellent.</p>
<p>General Jeang stood up abruptly, his face full of excitement and exhilaration. The generals around the conference room all looked over, but he had no time to explain. A scene from 30 years ago suddenly flashed through General Ciangs mind. In a certain sea area of the East China Sea, Japanese warships approached the edge of the territorial sea line. As the young man stood on the bridge of the patrol ship, he could clearly see the arrogance and mockery of those Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>I still vividly remember that humiliation. Today, we finally got our revenge. Okay. Okay. General Ciangs voice trembled as he raised his hand to wipe away tears of emotion from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>Old Xiao, well done. We&#x27;ve been holding this grudge for 20 years. He hung up the phone, turned around, and shouted to the room full of generals. Did you all hear that? All 15 warships of the Japanese Empire have sunk. Our laser cannons did the job.</p>
<p>The meeting room erupted in chaos. real great. We should have played like this a long time ago. Those little devils finally got their revenge this time. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>All the generals were filled with excitement and joy upon hearing the news. Some generals even wept with joy. They knew what this achievement meant. This is a moment of triumph that the great navy has longed for for many years. In the past, they mostly tolerated provocations from foreign warships.</p>
<p>Unless it&#x27;s extremely excessive, the main approach is expulsion. Because at that time the navy of the great Sia kingdom was too weak. Today because of the deployment of new weapons, we finally dealt a severe blow to the arrogant attitude of the Japanese devils. At this moment, all the generals finally realized the immense power and strategic significance of advanced weapons. The Navy has already installed laser cannons.</p>
<p>Next, it will be our army&#x27;s turn. Haha, an army general said happily. No, our air force also needs new equipment. We can&#x27;t fall behind. The Air Force generals began to make their own calculations.</p>
<p>The Navy&#x27;s resounding victory made them all realize the urgency of upgrading their equipment. The SEA Academy of Sciences is capable of developing superpowered laser cannons. They can definitely develop equipment for other military units. Next time, they must seize the opportunity to make their troops the first to be equipped with it. All the generals secretly made up their minds.</p>
<p>An equipment upgrade application must be submitted to the military headquarters immediately after the meeting. After his initial excitement, General Jang thought of the heroes who had contributed to the development of the superpowered laser cannon. I immediately dialed Lie Jang Wos number Li Jang Wo was reviewing materials and data in his office. His phone suddenly rang and he saw that the caller ID showed it was General Jeang. He answered it casually.</p>
<p>Old Jang, what&#x27;s up? I&#x27;m keeping an eye on the materials. What did you say? The next second, Lie Jian Guoo suddenly stood up straight. He didn&#x27;t even bother to adjust his reading glasses, which had slipped down to the tip of his nose. All 15 ships sank, including the Isumo. Are you sure it&#x27;s true? Great.</p>
<p>After receiving an affirmative answer, Lie Jang Guo suddenly burst into laughter. After hanging up the phone, he tucked his phone into his pocket and stroed towards the anti-gravity engine laboratory. Push open the door. They saw Linshin squatting on the ground, holding an engine part in his hand, looking at something. Shaolin, Shaolin.</p>
<p>Li Jang Wos voice was filled with excitement. Lynchin looked up and put down the parts. Oldly, what&#x27;s wrong? Great news. Incredible good news. Li Jian Guo leaned closer, lowering his voice, but unable to contain his excitement.</p>
<p>Over in the South China Sea, our superpowered laser cannon destroyed 15 Japanese warships. &quot;Really?&quot; Lyn Shins eyes lit up instantly. That&#x27;s right. Our Navy soldiers are all excellent. Regarding this result, he expressed great satisfaction.</p>
<p>With advanced weapons, we must show our strength and fight back. Only in this way can advanced weapons be put to use. Only by daring to unshath our swords can we let other countries know that the great kingdom is no longer a country that can be provoked at will. Lynshan stood up, dusted off his hands, and his eyes revealed determination and pride. Professor Lee, this proves that our research direction is correct.</p>
<p>The success of the superpowered laser cannon is just the beginning. In the future, we will develop more and more advanced weapons and equipment to further enhance the national defense capabilities of the great Sia Kingdom and make the people proud. After a pause, Lynchin continued, &quot;As for the Japanese devils, this time it&#x27;s just collecting some interest. From now on, we will make them pay for their crimes and blood.&quot; Li Jian Guo was stunned for a moment, then realized what was happening. Yes, from the invasion decades ago to the subsequent provocations in the seas, the Japanese devils owe the great Sea Kingdom far too much blood debt for their numerous atrocities.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not something that can be resolved simply by sinking a few warships. Good. Well said. Lie Jang Wos eyes were full of approval. Lynch nodded and didn&#x27;t say anything more, but no one knew that he was thinking about how to wipe out the Japanese in the future.</p>
<p>Chapter 62. The Allied fleet flees in panic. In the laboratory, other engineers overheard Lin Chun and his group&#x27;s conversation. I immediately became excited and thrilled. They also harbored a deep-seated hatred for the Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>The countless crimes committed by the Japanese invaders on Chinese soil in those years are etched into the hearts of every Chinese person like a sharp knife and have never been forgotten. Now that technological advancements have boosted the nation&#x27;s military strength, it&#x27;s time for revenge. All the engineers were determined to work harder to develop more advanced technologies and make our motherland stronger. Only when you are strong will you not be bullied. Only when the people live and work in peace and contentment can the country prosper and the people live in peace.</p>
<p>South China Sea. The USS Ford aircraft carrier. The communications soldier stumbled in clutching the latest battle report. His face contorted with panic. Commander, commander.</p>
<p>The remaining 14 warships of the Sakura Kingdom have all sunk. Upon hearing this, Sweet looked up abruptly, his eyes filled with disbelief. What did you say? They all sank. How is that possible? He snatched the battle report and looked at its contents. Laser cannon 40 beams sinks a ship in less than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Every word felt like a heavy hammer blow to his heart. Cold sweat instantly soaked through his military uniform. He recalled the scene he had just witnessed. The Isuma was blasted in two by a laser cannon, and the loud noise of the IWA&#x27;s keel breaking could be felt even through the screen. He thought that some of the remaining warships would escape.</p>
<p>Laser cannons are powerful. There should still be time for 14 warships to react, but in the end, they all sank. &quot;Madman, this bunch of madmen,&quot; Sweet muttered to himself, a chill running down his spine. He suddenly remembered President Ots words. &quot;Don&#x27;t push the great Sia Kingdom too far.&quot; At the time, he thought the president was making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p>Now I understand. It&#x27;s not that the great Sia Kingdom didn&#x27;t dare to take action. They simply hadn&#x27;t witnessed the true strength of the Great Sea Kingdom. Quick, Sweet suddenly roared, his voice distorted. Immediately, notify all Allied fleets.</p>
<p>Get away from the waters of the Great Sa Kingdom immediately. The farther the better. Also, declare the military exercise over now. Immediately. Right now.</p>
<p>The agitant recovering from his shock quickly replied, &quot;Yes, commander.&quot; He turned to leave, but Sweet called him back. etc. stared at the South China Sea on the screen, his eyes filled with fear. Tell them that if they encounter warships from the Great Sea Kingdom, they are not allowed to provoke them. They are not allowed to stop.</p>
<p>Even if the enemy fires warning shots, we have no choice but to retreat. The agitant&#x27;s heart sank and he quickly nodded. Understood. on the coalition channel. The moment gave the order, chaos erupted.</p>
<p>The South Korean fleet commander questioned, &quot;What?&quot; The military exercise is over. What? The captain of the Indian aircraft carrier was even more anxious. Switzerland, our aircraft carrier is still nearby. If we retreat now, won&#x27;t we become a laughingtock in the world? Sweet interrupted them abruptly, his voice icy. A joke better than sinking in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>All 15 warships of Japan have sunk in less than half an hour. Would you like to try out the Great Sea Kingdoms laser cannon? The channel fell silent instantly. No one dared to refute it anymore. The South Korean warships, which were originally inching closer to the edge of the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s territorial waters, immediately turned around and sped up to maximum power. Upon hearing this, the two aircraft carriers from India went even further, turning around and fleeing frantically towards their territory.</p>
<p>The warships of the French and the British Empire, which had been observing the situation, also retreated without hesitation. The entire coalition fleet, like a group of frightened rabbits, frantically fled from the South China Sea. On the sea, the once orderly fleet formation instantly became chaotic on the USS Ford aircraft carrier. Sweet breathed a long sigh of relief as he watched the Allied fleets escape route on the screen. But then he remembered something else.</p>
<p>Agitant, contact the White House immediately. Tell the president that the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannons are far more terrifying than we imagined. Make them come up with a countermeasure quickly or we will lose our maritime hijgemony. The agitant nodded and turned to make the contact. Sweet walked to the window and looked at the distant sea.</p>
<p>The sunlight was blinding yet he felt a chill run through his body. He suddenly had a premonition. Starting today, the maritime landscape of Earth is about to change. and the era of American hijgemony may be coming to an end. At the same time, a certain sea area in the South China Sea on the deck of the Type055 destroyer.</p>
<p>Jeang Jun Feay watched the trajectory of the Allied fleets escape on the screen. Feeling somewhat unsatisfied, they ran away already. We&#x27;re not done yet. The first mate leaned over excitedly and said, &quot;Captain, should we give chase? Let&#x27;s teach them a lesson. No need.&quot; Jeang Junf shook his head, his eyes sharp.</p>
<p>None of them entered our territorial waters. If we really catch up, that would be a direct declaration of war. Taking down those Japanese devils this time is quite a haul. He paused, then picked up the walkie-talkie. Notify all brother ships to remain on alert.</p>
<p>If any fool dares to turn around fire, a unified response came from the walkie-talkie. Roger. The sea breeze blew across the deck and the military flag fluttered in the wind. Jang Jun Fay gazed into the distance, his eyes filled with anticipation. The US, if you dare to come to the South China Sea again, it won&#x27;t be as simple as sinking a few warships.</p>
<p>At this time, in the laboratory of the Xiaku Institute, Lynch was carefully inspecting the parts of the anti-gravity engine, Lie Jiano walked over and said with a smile, Shaolin, &quot;The allied forces have retreated.&quot; Swed also announced the end of the military exercise. Lynshan nodded, his hands continuing their work. It&#x27;s good that they retreated. It seems they&#x27;re scared. Now, let&#x27;s focus on preparing for the next project.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wo paused for a moment, then laughed. You all you care about is your research and development. Lynchin raised his head. A glint of light flashing in his eyes. He: This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Once our space fighter is developed by then the sky over blue star will also change. Li Jian Guo was excited and his eyes were full of anticipation as he looked at Lin Chan. Yes, we just collected some interest on the dead at sea. Shouldn&#x27;t we start settling scores with this guy, too? Back in the White House, Otto was unaware of Sweet&#x27;s report. He was sitting in his office looking at the map of the South China Sea on his desk, a smug smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>Great Sia Kingdom, soon you will be begging me to negotiate. He picked up his coffee cup, about to drink it. The red telephone on the desk suddenly rang. This is an emergency hotline used only for the most critical matters. Heart sank.</p>
<p>He put down his coffee cup and answered the phone. Hello. On the other end of the phone, Sweet&#x27;s hurried voice came through. Mr. President, something terrible has happened.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom. The Great Sa Kingdoms laser cannon sank all 15 warships of the Sakura Kingdom. Our allied fleet has retreated across the board. Otep stood there stunned for a long time before he could react. What did you say? 15 ships all sunk.</p>
<p>Chapter 63. Hell on Earth. The Japanese Devils collapse. The sea area where the Japanese warship sank was like a living hell. Many Japanese soldiers were splashing around on the sea, but the Allied fleet had long since abandoned them.</p>
<p>There is only one outcome awaiting them, death. At the same time, the global live streaming platforms were in an uproar. The great SIA Kingdom live stream room. The barrage of comments from netizens rained down on the screen. Holy crap.</p>
<p>All 15 ships sank. Our laser cannons were way too powerful. W. I&#x27;ve finally gotten my revenge. Long live the motherland.</p>
<p>Haha. Finally, I&#x27;ve seen those Japanese devils get their comeuppants. I&#x27;ve been holding this in for decades. You guys in the Navy are awesome. You deserve a separate page in the family tree.</p>
<p>Weren&#x27;t those Japanese nizens very arrogant before? Why are they silent now? Some people directly posted old photos. Footage of Japanese warships provoking a Dasha patrol ship decades ago. As our ancestors said, &quot;A gentleman&#x27;s revenge is never too late, even after 10 years.&quot; The screen was filled with cheers, and some people even typed in red text. Those who offend our great Sa will be punished no matter how far away they are, creating a scene brimming with patriotic fervor. This shows that everyone&#x27;s desire and excitement for this victory had been building up for a long time.</p>
<p>Now we finally witnessed this gratifying scene. They felt only the exhilaration and exhilaration of finally avenging their great grudge. Countless people were moved to tears, especially the veterans. Upon hearing the news, she was so excited that she burst into tears. Only those who have experienced it truly understand how hard one today&#x27;s victory was.</p>
<p>In other countries, live streams, however, the scene was quite different. In Japan, fell silent instantly. A moment later, it erupted instantly. Impossible. This is fake.</p>
<p>It must be AI generated. Damn it. The Great Sa Kingdom must have used some underhanded tricks. How could all our warships have sunk? Why won&#x27;t the Allied fleet rescue our warriors? Why are they abandoning them? W That despicable great Sia Kingdom. They&#x27;ve declared war on us.</p>
<p>We must take revenge. Japanese nizens are furiously cursing the great sea kingdom. They also cursed the Allied fleet for failing to come to their aid. More than anything, there was despair and fear. They never dreamed that the laser cannons of the Great Sa Kingdom would be so terrifying.</p>
<p>So terrifying that their fleet was completely unable to retaliate. Many Japanese soldiers began to worry whether the Great Sea Kingdom would continue to retaliate against them. Some Japanese nizens were completely devastated. 15 warships were sunk by the Great Sea Kingdom. This was a huge blow to them.</p>
<p>This was difficult for them to accept at first. South Korean nizens were dripping with sarcasm. Damn it. The Great Sea Kingdom must have stolen our laser technology. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been researching laser weapons for a while now. They must have been stealing our secrets. Some people even dug up news from South Korea&#x27;s laser weapon test from a few years ago. Look, we already had the technology. DA just copied it.</p>
<p>A netizen from Daar retorted directly. Your crappy laser that can&#x27;t even hit its target. You dare to compare yourself to us. Steal from you? If you&#x27;re so capable, why don&#x27;t you dare fight alongside the Japanese devils? South Korean nizens were rendered speechless by the rebuttal, and the number of comments in the live chat gradually decreased. American nizens are also starting to panic.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. Is the great SA kingdom about to rise? Yes, the Lion of the East is awakening. What should we do? Get the fleet back immediately. Don&#x27;t send them to their deaths in the South China Sea. The comment section was full of anxiety.</p>
<p>The arrogance of before was gone. During this time, they gained a deep understanding of the history of the Great Sea Kingdom. I gained a completely new understanding of the resilience and wisdom of the great Sia Kingdom. They realized that once awakened, the power unleashed by this country with its long history and splendid culture would be immeasurable. The previous disdain and misunderstanding of the great Sia kingdom were completely shattered at this moment.</p>
<p>Some American nizens have begun to reflect on this. Was it because past policies were too aggressive that we are now in such a passive situation? They worried that the rise of the great SA kingdom would disrupt the existing international order and affect their own interests and status. Nizens in India also began to feel fear. My god, 15 warships sank in half an hour. The Great Sea Kingdom is terrifying.</p>
<p>Luckily, our aircraft carrier withdrew quickly. Otherwise, we would have been finished. Immediately, order the border troops to retreat further. Don&#x27;t provoke the great Sia Kingdom. A nizen posted a satellite image of an Indian aircraft carrier fleeing, commenting, &quot;Run faster.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t look back.&quot; The voices that had been shouting, &quot;Revenge!&quot; were completely gone. The shock of international nizens is almost overflowing the screen. My god, is the great SEA Kingdom about to rise to power? Is America&#x27;s maritime hijgemony really coming to an end? Finally, a country can suppress this bully, the United States. Seeing that the Great Sia Kingdom was finally able to suppress the Eagle Alliance. All the countries that have been bullied by the US are filled with joy.</p>
<p>They would rather the Great Sia Kingdom become the Hijgemon of Earth than be bullied by the United States. the White House Oval Office. OP put down the satellite phone, his hands still trembling. Sweet&#x27;s report just now hit him like a hammer blow. 15 warships, all sunk, laser cannons, in less than half an hour.</p>
<p>Every word sent chills down his spine. He thought the Great Sa Kingdom would be very strong. But I never imagined it would be this ridiculously strong. He remembered that half a year ago they had provoked the Great Sea Kingdom, but the Great Sa Kingdom had only issued a condemnation. But how much time has passed? Without any warning, they opened fire.</p>
<p>It seems that the great Sia kingdom has definitely made a major breakthrough in some technologies. Otep secretly guessed and his face darkened. The ease and composure of the past are gone. He had previously thought that the great Sia kingdom wouldn&#x27;t dare to really make a move. Now we realize it wasn&#x27;t that they were afraid, but that they had never witnessed the strength of the great Sia.</p>
<p>Quick, Otep shouted towards the door, his voice distorted. convene an emergency meeting immediately. Get Pete and Raymond here right now. Yes. The secretary hurriedly ran out.</p>
<p>OTP pondered the topics for the upcoming meeting. The rise of the great SEA kingdom has spiraled out of control. They must come up with a solution. Otherwise, they might fall from their pedestal. 10 minutes later, the White House conference room.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was so heavy it could drip water. Defense Secretary Pit, Secretary of State Raymond, and several other high-ranking military officials sat at the table, their faces grim, OTP said in a deep voice. &quot;Take a look. Take a look at report.&quot; &quot;The Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannons can destroy 15 warships in half an hour. What are your thoughts?&quot; Pete frowned and replied helplessly, &quot;Mr.</p>
<p>President, our USS Ford currently has no plan to counter laser cannons. No solution? We pour billions of dollars into our D every year and all you give me is no solution. OTP instantly flew into a rage, glaring angrily at Pete. Lay Ming Duo quickly spoke up. President, now is not the time to lose your temper.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to get the Great Sa Kingdom to stop using laser cannons. How can we stop? OP sneered. Threaten them with military exercises. They&#x27;re not afraid at all now. A naval admiral cautiously suggested.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could negotiate with the Great Sia Kingdom and ask them to share their laser cannon technology. Negotiation? Otep stared at him. Do you think the Great Sa Kingdom would agree? Silence fell over the meeting room. Everyone knows that the Great Sa Kingdom is no longer a pushover that can be easily manipulated. OTP took a deep breath, suppressing his anger.</p>
<p>Immediately increase investment in the research department. We must come up with a solution to counter the laser cannon within 3 months. The sixth generation fighter jet project will have its maiden flight within a month. Let the whole world know that the US is still the dominant power on earth. Also contact other allies and take the great SA kingdom to the international military court.</p>
<p>Even if we can&#x27;t do anything to the great SA kingdom, we should still annoy them. Chapter 64. Instantly destroys the Philippine warship. The Philippine Monkeys. There are gods in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan. Kishidajiro sat on the sofa, his face ashen. He had already smashed two of the teacups on the table. Bakup. All 15 warships sank.</p>
<p>Is Taro Kono a pig? Why doesn&#x27;t he know to retreat? Kishida Jiro roared, his voice filled with anger and panic. Defense Minister Taro Yamamoto&#x27;s eyes were also filled with anger. Prime Minister, the great Sia Kingdom has launched an undeclared war against us. We must retaliate. Counterattack.</p>
<p>Kisha Jiro suddenly stood up, pointed at Yamamoto Taro s nose and cursed. Idiot, do you have a way to deal with the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannon? No, but our warriors have an iron will. They are not afraid of death, and they will surely defeat the great Sea Kingdom. Yamamoto s voice grew softer and softer. Kishida Jiro glared at him and yelled, &quot;Are you an idiot? Can an iron will stop the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannon? If only we could have kept those 15 warships and thousands of soldiers, we wouldn&#x27;t have all perished by the end.</p>
<p>Kishida Jiurro s voice had become somewhat choked up. Previously, he had also thought of using joint military exercises to demonstrate Japan as strength and break free from the constraints of the World War II treaties, but now it has suffered heavy losses and become a laughingtock around the world. At the same time, it also made the great Sia kingdom famous far and wide. Kishidro thought about it. the more uneasy he felt.</p>
<p>Great Sia Kingdom, I&#x27;m not finished with you. Kisha Jiro suddenly roared, his eyes bloodshot. Contact the US immediately. Demand an explanation from them. Also, mobilize the reserve forces.</p>
<p>We need to expand our military. Taro Yamamoto nodded quickly. Yes, Prime Minister. But he knew in his heart that even if he expanded his army, he would still be no match for the great Sia Kingdom. The power of the laser cannon has exceeded their imagination.</p>
<p>However, this opportunity can also be used to expand the army. After this incident, I believe that the people at the grassroots level will certainly not have any objections. Not only that, Jiro Kishida also planned to take this opportunity to amend their country&#x27;s constitution. At that time, we can legitimately and massively expand our military strength. Thinking about it that way, Kishaurro felt a little better.</p>
<p>At least 15 warships can be considered somewhat worthwhile. Kisha Deajiro stared at the map on the wall, his eyes filled with malice as he looked at the location of the South China Sea. Great Sa Kingdom, you just wait of the Philippines. Little Mars sat in his office, trembling all over. He just received intelligence.</p>
<p>15 warships of the Sakura Kingdom have sunk. This is terrifying. The Great Sa Kingdom is terrifying. Little Mars muttered to himself, his eyes filled with terror. Previously, he had planned to have those dilapidated warships cooperate with the fishermen to pretend to cross the border and provoke the great Sia Kingdom to take action.</p>
<p>But now, just thinking about it sends chills down my spine. Secretary, quick. Suddenly, Ma shouted at the secretary outside the door. Immediately, order the Navy to return immediately and all fishermen to stay away from the waters of the great Sia Kingdom. The secretary nodded quickly and turned to get the satellite phone.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the secretary ran back, her face pale. Mr. President, something terrible has happened. Fishing boats and warships in the South China Sea have all lost contact. Out of contact, Little Mars suddenly stood up, his heart pounding in his throat.</p>
<p>How could we lose contact? Is the signal bad? Let&#x27;s try again. The secretary tried several more times, but still couldn&#x27;t get through. President, we can&#x27;t reach you by satellite phone or radio. Little Mars slumped in his chair, cold sweat streaming down his forehead. He suddenly remembered that their warships were actually not far from the Japanese fleet.</p>
<p>Could it be? Could it be that they were also destroyed by the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannons? The moment the thought crossed his mind, little Mars felt a chill run through his body. He looked out the window where the Philippine flag was fluttering in the wind. Previously, he even thought of relying on the United States to compete with Great Sea for the South China Sea. But now the US combined fleet was scared away. Why would they care about the Philippines? If they were to provoke the Great Sa Kingdom again at this point, they would suffer an even worse fate than the Sakura Kingdom.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s really over. Little Mars muttered to himself, his eyes filled with despair. He could only pray that their warships had simply lost contact, otherwise. Meanwhile, in the South China Sea, on the deck of the Type055 destroyer, Jeang Jun Feay was watching the satellite monitoring.</p>
<p>On the screen, those Japanese soldiers were struggling frantically on the sea. You little devils, you finally met your match. That&#x27;s great. The more miserable the Japanese soldiers are, the happier he is. Just then, the first officer walked over looking excited.</p>
<p>Captain, the 815 ship has sent a message that they&#x27;ve spotted 10 more small fish. Oh, Jean Jun Fe&#x27;s eyes lit up. Is it a Korean or an Indian? Neither. The vice captain shook his head. It&#x27;s 10 secondhand warships from the Philippines.</p>
<p>Their signals have already been blocked by 815. The Filipino monkey Jean Junf was taken aback. He then snorted coldly. Those few dilapitated warships of theirs dare to intrude into our territorial waters now. The Filipino monkey is like a disgusting flea.</p>
<p>They always like to jump around and make their presence known thanks to the protection of the US. Previously, the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s navy had relatively weak long range navigation capabilities. There&#x27;s nothing we can do about them, but if they still dare to barge in now, then we must teach the Filipino monkeys a lesson they won&#x27;t forget. He picked up the walkie-talkie and shouted, &quot;Attention all ships. Philippine ships spotted.</p>
<p>Coordinates (XX) lock onto and destroy them immediately.&quot; A unified response came from the walkie-talkie. Roger. All the warships began to move. Coordinates locked. Laser cannon begins charging.</p>
<p>South China Sea. A certain sea area. 10 warships from the Philippines carrying hundreds of fishing boats arrived after learning that the warships of the Sakura Kingdom had been destroyed. They frantically fled towards the Philippines. on the USS Conrad or frigot.</p>
<p>The captain filled with fear roared, &quot;Fuck, give me full speed ahead and get out of the great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s waters as soon as possible. Well be safe once we leave the waters of the great Sea Kingdom.&quot; Then he asked loudly, &quot;Have you been able to contact headquarters yet?&quot; The communication soldier replied in a trembling voice, &quot;No, all signals have been jammed.&quot; The captain&#x27;s face was terribly grim. There must be a warship from the great Sia Kingdom nearby. They must have used new electronic jamming equipment. We simply can&#x27;t break through, the communication soldier said, his voice trembling with tears.</p>
<p>The captain slammed his fist on the control panel. Damn the great Sea Kingdom. How could they have such powerful methods? At this moment, the soldiers on the ship were also filled with anxiety. They looked at the vast ocean around them as if surrounded by endless fear. Some people began to whisper among themselves, &quot;Are we going to die here? What if the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannons suddenly fire at us?&quot; Hearing the soldiers murmurss, the captain roared, &quot;Shut up! We are warriors of the Philippines, and we cannot be so easily intimidated.</p>
<p>Even if we die, we will die with dignity.&quot; Just then, a lookout suddenly shouted, &quot;Captain!&quot; unidentified light spotted, rapidly approaching us. The captain&#x27;s face turned deathly pale instantly. It&#x27;s a laser cannon from the great Sia Kingdom. Quick, take evasive action. Take evasive action.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was all too late. Five laser beams hit the Conrad instantly. In an instant, the entire warship was engulfed by the intense heat, and the pungent smell of twisted metal filled the air. The USS Conrad was destroyed in an instant. Some of the Filipino soldiers on board were vaporized, while others jumped into the sea to escape.</p>
<p>Soon, the wreckage of the Conrad disappeared into the sea. The same applies to the other nine warships. The Filipino monkeys on the hundreds of fishing boats nearby were terrified when they saw this scene. run. The Great Sa Kingdom is protected by gods.</p>
<p>Divine light is falling from the sky. It&#x27;s the gods punishing us. Boohoo! No, we dare not do it again. Please, God, forgive us. Filipino fishermen knelt on their fishing boats, frantically worshiping the sky.</p>
<p>They thought the laser was divine punishing them. Chapter 65. White Emperor Sky Fighter. 055. Drive up.</p>
<p>Captain, all the warships that invaded from the Philippines have been destroyed. Do those fishing boats need to be dealt with? No need. Jeang Jun Feay shook his head. I believe that after this incident, they will definitely not dare to enter our territorial waters again. If warships were actually used to destroy their fishing boats, it would leave a handle for them to use against them and trigger unnecessary international disputes.</p>
<p>After all, those fishing boats were using fishing as a pretext for probing and intrusion, not a real military threat. At most, we can only send coast guard ships to drive them away. The fishing boats are all fleeing in panic, so there&#x27;s no need to deploy coast guard vessels. Then, Jeang Jun Feay ordered the other warships to continue patrolling the South China Sea. At the same time, the message was reported to Ziao Tiani, commander of the southern Guang Dong military region.</p>
<p>The Japanese warships destroyed it. Commander Xiao was not particularly surprised by the 10 small kuramis from the Philippines. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve already gotten used to it. Half a day later, the hundreds of fishing boats belonging to the Philippines finally escaped back to the port of the Philippines. As soon as the fishermen disembarked, they collapsed to the ground and wailed.</p>
<p>Wah! The Great Sea Kingdom is protected by gods in the South China Sea. Divine light descended from the sky, destroying our warships, leaving not even a trace. The news spread like wildfire throughout the entire port. The Filipino fishermen at the port were instantly in an uproar. Some people were so frightened that they packed up their fishing nets on the spot and refused to go out to sea again.</p>
<p>I used to dare to fish in the waters of the Great Sea Kingdom, but I&#x27;ll never dare to do it again. I never imagined that the Great Sea Kingdom truly had gods. From now on, I must keep my distance with respect. The news spread like a plague. It quickly spread throughout the coastal areas.</p>
<p>Although it seems unbelievable, but the returning fisherman told the story in great detail. Many people were skeptical, it has been decided to refrain from fishing outside the designated area for the time being inside the presidential palace. As Little Mars looked at the latest intelligence, his face was terribly gloomy. Intelligence indicates that all 10 warships were destroyed with no survivors. &quot;Fuck, fuck.&quot; He violently tore the report up.</p>
<p>The secretary stood beside him, bowing his head and whispering, &quot;Mr. President, people are saying, saying that there is a deity protecting the South China Sea of the Great Sia Kingdom.&quot; &quot;Gods, little Mars,&quot; sneered, but his eyes were filled with fear. &quot;Those are laser cannons. They&#x27;re the weapons of the Great Sia Kingdom.&quot; He suddenly remembered something and looked up abruptly. &quot;Give the order immediately.</p>
<p>All fishermen, all boats. Anyone who dares to approach the waters of the great Sa Kingdom will be arrested on the spot. Also, notify the border to increase vigilance. The secretary nodded quickly and turned to leave. Wait.</p>
<p>Little Mars called out to him again, his voice trembling. Contact the US again and asked them if they&#x27;re going to do anything about it. The secretary responded and left. Little Moss slumped in his chair, looking out the window at the national flag. The flag fluttered in the wind as if mocking his incompetence.</p>
<p>How could the great Sia Kingdom suddenly become so strong? Why? He muttered to himself, his eyes filled with despair. Two days later, International Military Tribunal. The hall was full of people. The American representative slammed his fist on the table, spitting as he spoke. The Great Sa Kingdom abused its power, destroying the warships of the Sakura Kingdom and the Philippines.</p>
<p>This is a violation of international military law. Compensation is required. An apology is required. The representative from the Sakura Kingdom echoed sharply. All 15 of our warships have sunk.</p>
<p>Thousands of soldiers have perished. The great SA kingdom must take responsibility. The representative from the Philippines also stood up, his face flushed red. Our warships have also been destroyed and our fishermen have been frightened. The Great Sea Kingdom demands an explanation.</p>
<p>All eyes of the representatives from various countries were focused on the representative of the Great Sea Kingdom. The representative of the great SA kingdom slowly rose to his feet and declared doineeringly, &quot;First of all, the warships of Japan and the Philippines illegally entered our territorial waters. Our country will eliminate all invading enemies in accordance with laws and regulations. I also want to ask you, by sending warships into our territorial waters, are you trying to wage war without declaring war?&quot; The American representative didn&#x27;t dare to respond and quickly change the subject. We are in international waters and you have no right to interfere.</p>
<p>Huh? Pisces. The representative of the great Sia Kingdom sneered, taking out a document and slamming it on the table. This is a UN recognized map of maritime boundaries. If you don&#x27;t acknowledge it, our warships can also patrol near your country another day. You, the American representative, was trembling with anger, but dared not respond directly.</p>
<p>if he dares to deny it. They don&#x27;t have laser weapons as advanced as those of the Great Sa Kingdom. The warships of the Great Sea Kingdom might actually sail into their territorial waters. At that point, will they expel them or not? Therefore, the US representative can only keep quiet. The representative from Japan tried to argue, &quot;We were just conducting joint military exercises and had no intention of intruding into your territorial waters.&quot; Unintentional.</p>
<p>the representative from Great Sea Kingdoms eyes turned cold. You call it unintentional after spending a dozen minutes in our territorial waters. Or perhaps our warships might also consider taking a stroll in your territorial waters tomorrow. I, the representative from the Sakura country, did not dare to respond. The hall was completely silent.</p>
<p>The representative of the great Sia Kingdom surveyed the entire room, his voice firm. Our country respects international law, but will never allow any country to infringe upon our sovereignty. We don&#x27;t provoke trouble, but we&#x27;re not afraid of trouble either. After saying that, he turned around and sat down. The hawk representative opened his mouth, but couldn&#x27;t utter a single word.</p>
<p>In this debate, the great Sia kingdom emerged victorious. Representatives from other countries applauded, and the applause echoed like a tide in the hall. Many national representatives who had initially adopted a wait and see attitude chose to stand with the great Sia kingdom. They have come to a deep understanding of the power of the great SA kingdom. If you don&#x27;t take sides now, when will you? The representatives from the United States and Japan turned grim upon seeing this.</p>
<p>This is the last thing they wanted to see. But now they can&#x27;t find an excuse to make things difficult for the great Sia Kingdom. In the end, he could only leave early in anger and humiliation. Seeing this, the applause became even more enthusiastic. With this, the South China Sea naval exercise incident has come to an end.</p>
<p>Siaki Yuan in Li Jang Wos office. Wong Hao, the leader of the sixth generation fighter jet project team, pleaded. Dean, the new engine has passed testing. When can our sixth generation fighter jet project be restarted? Restart the project? Lie Jian Guo frowned and shook his head. Not for now.</p>
<p>Shaolin said there&#x27;s a seventh generation fighter jet project. What? Wonggha was taken aback, then realized, &quot;Dean, we already have a foundation in the sixth generation fighter jet. As long as we work a little harder, we&#x27;ll see results soon. Seventh generation fighters are too far off. We urgently need sixth generation fighters to make a difference.&quot; Lie Jian Guo sighed.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry about this. Let me talk to Shiaolin about it first. He picked up the phone and dialed Lynch&#x27;s number. in Lynchens office. He had just finished compiling the technical data for the seventh generation aerospace fighter.</p>
<p>His phone rang and seeing it was Lie Jian Guo, he answered it oldly. What is it? Xialin. The sixth generation fighter jet project team wants to restart the project. What do you think? Lynch paused for a moment, then laughed. Rebooting the sixth generation machine? No need.</p>
<p>I have already compiled the technical data for the seventh generation aerospace fighter. Its performance far surpasses that of sixth generation fighters. Let&#x27;s just go straight for seventh generation fighters. Lie Jian Guo on the other end of the phone instantly became excited. Really? You&#x27;ve already finished? Yes.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded. We can hold a technical demonstration meeting tomorrow so that everyone can see it. After hanging up the phone, Lynchin looked at the data on his computer. On the cover, the six characters bitey aerospace fighter gleamed with a cold light. This is the name he came up with for the seventh generation fighter jet.</p>
<p>The white emperor symbolizes the sky of the great Sia kingdom which will be protected by him. Chapter 66. You call a speed of Mach 20 fighter jet. Siaki Yuan Dean&#x27;s office. As soon as Lie Jian Guo hung up the phone, he turned around and met Wong Hoa&#x27;s anxious eyes.</p>
<p>Wong Hao held the sixth generation fighter jet project proposal. Filled with anticipation and anxiety. Dean, is chief designer Lynn really saying we don&#x27;t need to develop a sixth generation fighter jet? But is a seventh generation fighter jet really reliable? Lie Jian Guo picked up his enamel mug, took a sip of tea, and slowly began to speak. Sial said that all the technical data has been compiled, and a demonstration meeting will be held tomorrow. Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll see when the time comes.</p>
<p>Wonggho frowned, his expression filled with helplessness. Looking at the sixth generation fighter jet design drawings in his hand, he felt a mix of emotions. The team has worked hard for 5 years and the engine has just passed testing. They are about to see results. It was suddenly paused.</p>
<p>Now a seventh generation fighter jet has appeared and it wants to skip the sixth generation altogether. But Dean, we already have a foundation in sixth generation fighter jets. We haven&#x27;t even seen a seventh generation fighter jet yet. What if something goes wrong? How about we proceed with both projects simultaneously? Wongghao was still unwilling to give up and wanted to try. Li Jian Guo put down his teacup and earnestly said, &quot;You still don&#x27;t believe in Kobayashis abilities? Quantum lithography machines, superpowered laser cannons, anti-gravity engines.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t they all epic-making technologies?&quot; Wongghao opened his mouth, wanting to refute, but unable to say anything. He recalled Linshin&#x27;s previous achievements, and his heart couldn&#x27;t help but pound. But what exactly is the concept of a seventh generation fighter jet? This was beyond his comprehension. All right, let&#x27;s see tomorrow. If it doesn&#x27;t work, the sixth generation fighter jet project must be restarted.</p>
<p>Wonggho had already decided in his mind what to do if the seventh generation fighter jet did not meet expectations after tomorrow&#x27;s meeting. He was determined to restart the sixth generation fighter jet project. This is the key to the great SIA kingdom surpassing Western countries in the field of air force. If it weren&#x27;t for the one or two months of suspension, they might already be preparing for test flights. The next day at 9:00, conference room of the Xiaku Academy, Wong Hao was stunned when he walked in and was met with a room full of people.</p>
<p>Academician Jang from the aerospace field, academician Lu, a leading figure in material science, Dr. Zhao, a radar expert. They are all prominent figures in the industry. Academician Jang with his gray hair, sat in the front row leaning on a cane. He saw Wong Hao and waved.</p>
<p>Shiao Wong, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. I heard chief designer Lynn is going to develop a seventh generation fighter jet. Is that plausible? Wong Hao shook his head with a rice smile. Mr. Jang, I&#x27;m not sure either.</p>
<p>I only found out about this yesterday, and I was still wondering about it. Academician Lu pushed up his reading glasses. Sigh. Just when we were starting to see progress on a sixth generation fighter, we jumped to a seventh generation one. This step is a bit too big.</p>
<p>The surrounding experts also began to discuss it. Yes, we&#x27;ve only just begun to see progress with sixth generation fighters and we don&#x27;t even know what direction the seventh generation fighters will take. If it&#x27;s to be adapted to a new anti-gravity plasma engine, then how should it be designed? But that was proposed by chief engineer Lynn. So, there shouldn&#x27;t be any major problems. Although everyone had doubts, the fact that it was Lin Shun who proposed it gave them a bit of hope.</p>
<p>Just then, the meeting room door was pushed open. Li Jang Guoo dressed in a smart Jong Sean suit walked in with great spirit. Lynshin followed behind wearing a white t-shirt and faded jeans. Lie Jian Guo stepped onto the podium and began to speak. Everyone, thank you for making this trip.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s meeting is classified as top secret. Please sign the agreement first. The staff distributed the agreements to everyone. The young experts attending this level of meeting for the first time trembled when they saw the words top secret. This This is the highest level of confidentiality.</p>
<p>I heard that this was only signed when we were working on nuclear weapons. Some people couldn&#x27;t help but mutter to themselves, their eyes filled with shock. Those who had previously attended Linshins technical discussion sessions instantly had their eyes light up. The speed at which they signed the papers was so fast, it was as if they were afraid of missing out on some incredible opportunity. After everyone had signed the agreement, Lynshin stepped to the front of the stage.</p>
<p>He turned on the projector and the six bold characters by aerospace fighter instantly appeared on the screen. Ladies and gentlemen, today I will introduce the technical parameters of the bitey space fighter. Lynch picked up the laser pointer and tapped the screen. When the first line of parameters appeared, the entire room fell silent instantly. Maximum payload 20 tons.</p>
<p>Max speed 20 Mach. Cruising speed 15 Mach. Equipped with an anti-gravity plasma engine and a super solid magnetic field battery, it has a range of 40,000 km. Wonggho suddenly stood up filled with shock. Mach 20 40,000 km range.</p>
<p>How How is this possible? Academician Jangs eyes widened in disbelief. Shiao Wong is right at Mach 20. How do we solve the overload problem? What materials did you use? How did you address the safety concerns of the pilots? Lynchin smiled and continued to explain. In terms of materials, we use the same materials as the anti-gravity plasma engine. All parameters are fully capable of withstanding the high frictional temperatures of Mach 20.</p>
<p>He paused, then continued explaining. There&#x27;s absolutely no need to worry about overload. The cockpit is specially designed to prevent injury to the pilot during sudden acceleration of the fighter jet. Professor Louu was utterly shocked after hearing this. This this design can actually achieve anti-gravity.</p>
<p>If this can really be achieved, it will put us at least 50 years ahead of the world. Other experts and missions were so shocked by these parameters that they were speechless. Achieving even one of these is already incredibly impressive. Achieving all of that is simply beyond the reach of current technology. However, the parameters and data that Lynch released made them feel very real.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like data obtained through every test. Lynshin ignored their shock and continued speaking. The avionic system adopts a fully intelligent design which can automatically avoid all enemy attacks and can also achieve autopilot. The airborne 3D visual radar has a detection range of 5,000 km and can lock onto 2,000 targets simultaneously. In terms of weapon systems, it is equipped with two super powerful laser cannons with a range of 1,500 km.</p>
<p>The stealth coating utilizes the latest super stealth materials, enabling radar stealth, infrared stealth, visual stealth, and thermal imaging stealth. The words had barely left his mouth. The entire conference room was eerily quiet. The experts and missions gaped, their mouths agape as if they could fit an egg in them, and it took them a long time to come to their senses. The meeting room erupted instantly.</p>
<p>A fully intelligent avionics system. A 5,000 km detection range. 2,000 lock targets. A superpowered laser cannon with a range of 1,500 km. A super stealth coating.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t a fighter jet. It&#x27;s practically a mobile aerial fortress. Academician Jangs fingers trembled slightly as he looked at the parameters on the screen. He had lived to be over 70 years old and had never seen such an outrageous fighter jet. A speed of Mach 20.</p>
<p>You call this thing a fighter jet? This is clearly a weapon capable of going to heaven and earth. The surrounding experts echoed their agreement. This is outrageous. This technology is simply not what we should have now. If this could really happen, no one would dare to venture into our skies again.</p>
<p>The air force of the great Sia Kingdom is about to rise completely. The doubt on everyone&#x27;s faces turned into shock and their eyes were filled with excitement. Lynchin smiled as he looked at everyone&#x27;s reactions. Please rest assured everyone. These parameters are all achievable.</p>
<p>Wong Hao gasped utterly convinced. Looking at the diagram of the white emperor fighter jet on the screen, all his inner turmoil disappeared. Chief engineer Lynn, I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;m immediately halting the sixth generation fighter jet project and fully cooperating with the development of the seventh generation fighter jet. Thunderous applause erupted in the conference room and lasted for a long time.</p>
<p>After the applause subsided, Lynchin slowly began to speak. Ladies and gentlemen, the White Emperor fighter jet can not only operate within the atmosphere. It can also break through the atmosphere and enter space to fight. As soon as he finished speaking, the entire room fell silent again. Everyone stared wideeyed.</p>
<p>Break through the atmosphere. Entering space. Is this a move to dominate near Earth space? Chapter 67. Goal: Near Earth Space Overlord. The meeting room was deathly silent.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Lynn Shanun, their eyes filled with shock. Hiss, that&#x27;s terrifying. They can even fight in space. With the addition of superpowered laser weapons, we could launch a full range attack on any corner of the planet from space. This is true allround seamless and comprehensive air and space strike.</p>
<p>Wong-s apple bobbed and his voice trembled. Chief Engineer Lynn. This This is going to make the great Sia Kingdom dominate near Earth space. Lynch nodded, his eyes sharp. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>The battlefields of the future will not be confined to the atmosphere. We also need to ensure that our near-Earth space combat capabilities are also leading. Academician Jang stood up tremblingly, his voice trembling. Excellent. What a brilliant near-Earth space warfare strategy.</p>
<p>I have lived for more than 70 years and I can finally see the great SIA kingdom leading the world. Academician Louu pushed up his reading glasses, his eyes reening. In the past, we could only envy the US when it came to its space program. Currently, while our space station is not lagging behind, we still have a certain gap in terms of satellites. If the mighty space fighter can be successfully developed in a short period of time, then we will no longer have to worry about the safety of nearear space.</p>
<p>In the conference room, all the experts andademicians expressed their excitement. A moment later, Lie Jian Guo walked to the front of the stage, pressed his hand down, and slowly began to speak. I believe everyone agrees with this technology. I hereby declare, &quot;The Bite Space Fighter Project has been officially established. All resources of the SIA Academy of Sciences will be prioritized for the Bite project.</p>
<p>Equipment, personnel, funds, whatever you need, we&#x27;ll provide.&quot; The experts were instantly thrilled. Great. I&#x27;m applying to join the coding research and development team. Count me in for the radar project. I&#x27;m familiar with AI powered autonomous driving.</p>
<p>I want to participate. Lynch looked at the scene before him and was deeply moved. These veteran experts and missians are still so energetic. But Lynchin already had a plan in mind to cultivate more young talents. Only in this way can the talent needs of the Great Sa Kingdom be met after it leaves Earth.</p>
<p>In the future, the great SEA Kingdom will certainly not stop at the solar system. They will definitely go out and explore the vast universe. The BY Aerospace fighter jet is the first step in the struggle for space domination. One week later, materials laboratory of the Siaku Institute. Academician Louu held a metal plate the size of his palm, his hands trembling.</p>
<p>The metal plate was completely black and did not reflect any light under the lamp. Chief engineer Lynn. The super stealth coding sample is a success. Lynchin walked over and took the metal plate. What are the test parameters? The tester ran over holding the report in his hand.</p>
<p>His voice excited. Chief engineer Lynn. Look. Radar cross-section 0.00001 m 1,000 times lower than existing stealth materials. Infrared stealth completely shielded.</p>
<p>Thermal imagers cannot detect it at all. Visual invisibility. It automatically changes color according to the current environment from 500 meters away, making it invisible to the naked eye. Liian Guo leaned closer, his eyes wide. 0.00001.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Even the most advanced stealth fighters have a radar cross-section of 0.01. Academician Lou slapped the table and burst into laughter. In the past, we were always held back by the United States stealth technology. Now our technology can render their radar blind. Academician Jeang held the thermal imager and aimed it at the metal plate.</p>
<p>The screen was completely black with no red dots. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. With this coating, the white Emperor fighter jet can even become invisible in space. Lynchin looked at the parameters of the stealth material and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>Good. Get the relevant mass production process parameters set up and start mass production immediately. Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn. Two weeks later, radar laboratory. Dr.</p>
<p>Zhao stood in front of a huge piece of equipment, his face flushed. Chief Engineer Lynn. The 3D visual radar has been successfully developed. The device starts up and a 3D map appears on the screen instantly. From the ground to space, 5,000 km away.</p>
<p>Every detail is clearly visible. From birds in flight to solar panels on satellites, everything is clearly visible. Dr. Joe pointed at the screen, his voice trembling. Detection range 5,000 km, covering the entire East Asian airspace.</p>
<p>Simultaneous target lock 2,10 times more than existing radars. Identification speed 0.1 seconds. Capable of instantly distinguishing between fighter jets, missiles, and satellites. Lie Guo stared at the screen and gasped. 5,000 km.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s enough to see the US aircraft carrier fleet directly. 2,000 targets. Even if the enemy launches a saturation attack, we can handle it. Academian Jeang squinted as he looked at the satellite on the screen. In the past, we relied on publicly available data from the United States to observe satellites.</p>
<p>Now, our own radar can see their satellites clearly. Looking at the excited crowd, Lynshin knew that the White Emperor Sky Fighter would soon be ready for assembly. Meanwhile, other parts have already begun to be manufactured. Anti-gravity plasma engines are readily available. The superpowered laser cannon has completed its airborne modification.</p>
<p>The avionic system remains as long as the final AI powered autonomous driving system is developed. The seventh generation aerospace fighter jet can then enter the final assembly stage. This speed of research and development. Even Lynchin had to admire him. He himself is in the inheritance space and has just begun to enter the assembly stage.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the progress in reality is also so fast. This shows how terrifying it is to concentrate all resources on one area. 3 days later, AI lab programmer Shaoli sat in front of his computer filled with excitement. Chief Engineer Lynn, prepare for testing the airborne humanoid AI. The computer screen lit up and a blue virtual human figure appeared.</p>
<p>Hello, Chief Engineer Lynn. I am the AI of the White Emperor fighter jet. Code name White Emperor. Lynch nodded. Not bad.</p>
<p>Not bad. Testing the autonomous driving function. The virtual figure nodded in a simulated flight scene appeared on the screen. The entire process of a fighter jet from takeoff to cruising and evading missiles is completed automatically. Every movement was incredibly precise, even more fluid than that of an ace pilot.</p>
<p>Shalley pointed at the screen and exclaimed excitedly. Chief engineer Lynn, look, AI can handle tens of thousands of unexpected situations. It can also autonomously plan the optimal flight path to avoid enemy air defense systems. Lie Jian Guo looked at the screen and couldn&#x27;t help but admire it. This virtual AI is even more powerful than those Ace pilots.</p>
<p>With it, even if the pilot encounters an emergency, the fighter jet can return to base on its own. Lynchan looked at the virtual figure and continued to give orders. White Emperor continued testing the weapon control system. The AI responded immediately and a laser cannon aiming image appeared on the screen. A simulated target 500 km away was instantly locked on and then hit and destroyed.</p>
<p>Lynch was very satisfied with the result. Next, the body aerospace fighter jet will enter the final assembly stage. Then you can proceed with the test. At the same time, Lynchin also came up with a plan for distributing these technologies. He had previously asked Li Jian Guo to stop adapting solid-state magnetic field batteries for automobiles precisely to wait for this moment.</p>
<p>With the anti-gravity plasma engine and the super solid magnetic field battery, in addition, there are now AI powered autonomous driving and 3D visual radar. It is entirely possible to design a completely new lowaltitude flying car. This will directly solve the current traffic congestion problem. After arranging the schedule for the next project, Lin Shan went to find Li Jian Guo. Chapter 68.</p>
<p>Civilian anti-gravity flying car office of the dean of the Academy of Sciences. Lie Jian Guo is signing the material application form for the Bid project. Hearing the knock on the door, he didn&#x27;t even look up and said, &quot;Come in.&quot; Lynchin pushed the door open and came in. Mr. Lee, there&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to discuss with you.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Xin. Li Jang Guoo looked up, put down his pen, and said, &quot;Is the body assembly line short staffed? I&#x27;ll get some more from other labs.&quot; &quot;No.&quot; Lynchin spread the blueprints out on the table. &quot;It&#x27;s about technology transfer.&quot; Technology transfer? Lie Jian Guo was taken aback, then remembered what Lynshin had mentioned before. &quot;You want to use anti-gravity technology for civilian purposes?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Lynshin pointed to the blueprints. The reason I asked you to stop adapting solid-state magnetic field batteries for automobiles was because of this.</p>
<p>He paused, then continued explaining. The anti-gravity plasma engine has had some functions reduced and miniaturized, but retains low altitude hovering and propulsion. The range has been reduced to 5,000 km, which is enough for daily commuting. That&#x27;s a great suggestion, Li Jang Wos eyes lit up. What about autonomous driving? We&#x27;ve retained the basic functions, Lynchin explained.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve removed battlefield evasion and weapon linkage, leaving only automatic obstacle avoidance and cruise control at Mach 5, which is perfectly adequate for civilian use. The detection range of the 3D visual radar has been reduced to 50 km, mainly used to identify road conditions and other flying vehicles to avoid collisions. The more Lie Gian Guo listened, the more feasible it seemed, and he became very excited. Salin, that&#x27;s a great suggestion. If this were developed, it could completely solve the traffic congestion problem.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not just about traffic congestion. Lynchin added, &quot;Lowaltitude flying cars don&#x27;t need to build roads, making travel in remote areas convenient, and the cost is much lower than building highways.&quot; Lie Jian Guo slapped his thigh excitedly and said, &quot;Great, I support this. Should we design it ourselves or should we partner with a car company? Let&#x27;s find domestic car manufacturers to cooperate with.&quot; Lynchin laughed. Let them jointly establish a new car company. We&#x27;ll provide the technology and they&#x27;ll be responsible for production.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo stared at Lynch, his eyes full of approval. He knew that Lynch did this entirely to ensure the survival of domestic car manufacturers. Otherwise, once flying cars are introduced, domestic car manufacturers will basically be out of business. Shaolin, it seems you had this planned all along. Li Jang Guoo remarked.</p>
<p>Yes. Lynch nodded. The White Emperor is for protecting the country and the flying car is for making people live a good life. Neither can be neglected. Li Jian Guo stood up, patted Lynn Shun on the shoulder and said, &quot;Well said, I&#x27;ll send a letter to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology right away, asking them to prepare the relevant standards in advance and strive to get car companies to produce prototypes within 6 months.&quot; At the same time, White House OTP sat behind his desk reviewing recent intelligence reports from the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, as shown above, this has been the case since the South China Sea incident ended. The Great Sa Kingdom kept a very low profile and did not do anything out of line. OTP had a feeling that the Great Sa Kingdom might be preparing some big move. At this moment, Secretary of State Raymond walked in, his face full of excitement. Mr.</p>
<p>President, great news. Lockheed says the sixth generation fighter jet will make its maiden flight on New Year&#x27;s Day. OTP looked up abruptly. Really? Absolutely true. Laying duo handed over the documents.</p>
<p>They also said that this sixth generation fighter jet can reach a maximum speed of Mach 5 and has a radar cross-section of 0.001 m, which is even better than the new stealth fighter jet currently in the Great Sa Kingdom. After hearing this, Otep&#x27;s expression gradually softened and he finally burst out laughing. Great, that&#x27;s wonderful. He stood up and paced back and forth in his office. Made in China on New Year&#x27;s Day, just in time for the new year.</p>
<p>Let the world see our strength. He turned to Pete. Hold a press conference immediately and release this news. I want the whole world to know that we will always be the technological superpower of Earth. Yes.</p>
<p>Pete quickly replied, finally feeling relieved. picked up the phone and called Loheed Martin CEO directly. Listen, the maiden flight on New Year&#x27;s Day must be a success. If anything goes wrong, your company can forget about getting any more military orders. A voice on the other end of the phone repeatedly assured him.</p>
<p>After hanging up the phone, ATP looked out the window, his eyes full of smuggness. The great SEA Kingdom wants to compare with us. They&#x27;re far from it. The moment the press conference was held, the world was in an uproar. American nizens flooded the screen with comments.</p>
<p>Haha, great news. We&#x27;re going to have our first flight of a sixth generation fighter jet. Mach 5, a reflection cross-section of 0.001 square me. This is true technological prowess. Made in China on New Year&#x27;s Day.</p>
<p>We must watch the live broadcast and let the people of Great Sa know who the true technological hijgemon is. I was worried about the rise of the Great Sea Kingdom before, but now it seems they are still far behind. Japanese nizens followed suit. Wow, the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet is amazing. With this fighter, we no longer need to fear the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>The maiden flight on New Year&#x27;s Day must be a real shock to Great Sia. Let them know that only by following the US can they find a way out. The previous warship losses are nothing. With the support of the US, we will get them back sooner or later. However, nizens in the great Sia Kingdom remained unusually calm.</p>
<p>First flight of a sixth generation fighter jet. Probably just a smoke screen. No matter how powerful your fighter jets are, are they as powerful as our laser cannons? If you&#x27;re so capable, try causing trouble on the day of the maiden flight and see if we don&#x27;t attack you. Nizens from other countries had a more nuanced attitude, quietly observing the situation. The US only announced the maiden flight.</p>
<p>They won&#x27;t believe it until they succeed. In addition, the great Sia Kingdom experienced a technological explosion. Who knows if the great SIA kingdom might have other cuttingedge technologies waiting for it. India, the prime minister&#x27;s office. Demo became instantly excited.</p>
<p>The US has developed a sixth generation fighter jet. Great. We&#x27;ll buy a batch once they start mass production. Then we can seek revenge against the great Sia Kingdom. Demo the immortal always kept the border issues in mind.</p>
<p>He has never forgotten the humiliation he suffered during this period. They have been waiting for time to take its revenge on the great Sa Kingdom. The sixth generation fighter jet is undoubtedly the best opportunity for India to retaliate against the great Sia kingdom. They are willing to buy it no matter how high the price. On the other side, the prime minister&#x27;s residence in the land of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>Jurro Kishida was also excited after seeing the announcement. Yoshi, I knew the US wouldn&#x27;t let me down. Great Sia Kingdom, you just wait. We will soon avenge our loss in the South China Sea. since the last South China Sea incident.</p>
<p>Japan then began to massively expand its military despite opposition from many countries. But they persisted in their own way. All this was to wait for an opportunity to take revenge on the Great Sea Kingdom. Now the US is about to make its maiden flight of a sixth generation fighter jet. Definitely deploy troops to Japan in the future.</p>
<p>Then we can seek revenge against the great SI Kingdom. The world is paying close attention to the US&#x27;s upcoming maiden flight of its sixth generation fighter jet. Even the great sea kingdom&#x27;s air force is no exception. Chapter 69. The first flight of a sixth generation jet.</p>
<p>A grand firework display. The great sia kingdom air force command. The meeting room was filled with smoke. The big screen was showing footage of the US press conference. The voice of the US military spokesperson was arrogant and harsh.</p>
<p>The sixth generation fighter jet will make its maiden flight on New Year&#x27;s Day. We will always be the technological hijgemon of the blue planet. Jeang frowned, a flash of anger in his eyes, and he slammed his hand on the table. This is a deliberate provocation by the US against us. His tone was filled with suppressed anger.</p>
<p>The operation staff officer next to him looked grim. Commander, our sixth generation fighter jet project is still on hold. If the US really succeeds in its maiden flight, the international pressure will be immense. Several young officers lowered their heads, their fists clenched so tightly they cracked. Yes, we finally caught up with fifth generation fighters.</p>
<p>Are we going to fall behind again? Sigh. Our sixth generation fighter jet was almost ready for development. Why did it stop? If we hadn&#x27;t stopped, perhaps we could have test flown it by now. The atmosphere in the meeting room was very oppressive. Everyone was holding back their energy.</p>
<p>Yet they felt utterly powerless. They only knew that the sixth generation fighter jet project had been halted. Nobody knew anything about the seventh generation fighter jet. In their eyes, the Great Sa Kingdom is about to be left behind by the United States in the field of fighter jets. Commander Louu took a deep drag on his cigarette and stubbed it out in the ashtray.</p>
<p>No, I have to go find the Sia Academy of Sciences. Even if the sixth generation fighter jet project can&#x27;t be restarted, we still need an explanation. He got up and left. He couldn&#x27;t sleep at night until he got an explanation from the Academy of Sciences. In any case, we cannot allow the air force of the great Sia Kingdom to fall behind that of the United States again.</p>
<p>The fifth generation fighter jets finally caught up. We must not lag behind in sixth generation fighter jets. We also need to catch up with the bombers. Siaki Yuan Dean&#x27;s office. Li Jian Guo was watching the press conference of the United States, took a sip of tea, and curled his lips slightly.</p>
<p>The US has also made its maiden flight of a sixth generation fighter jet. However, compared to our seventh generation fighter jets, it&#x27;s far inferior. Huh. If it weren&#x27;t for Lin Chin&#x27;s mighty sky fighter. Upon seeing this news, Li Jian Guo would also marvel at the technological leadership of the United States.</p>
<p>But things are different now. They don&#x27;t even look down on the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jets. Lynshin sat next to him, flipping through the design drawings of a civilian flying car without even looking up. Their sixth generation fighter jets are nothing but toys in front of Bidey. His tone was flat, as if he were talking about something insignificant.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo put down his teacup and smiled. You&#x27;re still as arrogant as ever. However, this arrogance is wellfounded. He pointed to the news and said, &quot;Do you think they might pull some tricks during their maiden flight on New Year&#x27;s Day?&quot; Lynchan finally looked up, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. Trying to pull some tricks, let them see what real cuttingedge technology is all about.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. There was a rapid knocking on the office door. Lie Jian Guo frowned slightly. Come in. The door opened and Commander Lu rushed in looking anxious.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Lie Jian Guo, he asked anxiously. Deanly, the US is about to make its maiden flight of a sixth generation fighter jet. When will our sixth generation fighter jet project be restarted? Li Jang Guoo smiled and explained. Commander Lu, please sit down and let&#x27;s talk. Commander Lu didn&#x27;t sit down and angrily pressed for an answer.</p>
<p>Deanly, you&#x27;re still laughing. The US is clearly targeting us this time. How can I not be anxious? At this moment, he had lost all the authority he once held as an Air Force commander. She paced back and forth in the office like a cat on a hot tin roof. At this moment, Lynshin put down the design drawings, stood up, and explained with a smile.</p>
<p>Commander Louu, please don&#x27;t be anxious. The sixth generation fighter jet project was halted, not because the technology was inadequate. Because we have something better. Commander Louu was taken aback, his eyes filled with doubt. Something better? What could be better than a sixth generation fighter jet? Lynchin smiled.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the White Emperor Space Fighter? It&#x27;s a seventh generation fighter jet. The kind that can fly into space. A seventh generation fighter jet. Commander Lou&#x27;s eyes widened instantly and his voice became excited. Go to space.</p>
<p>Chief designer Lynn. You&#x27;re not kidding, are you? He had lived most of his life and had never heard of fighter jets going into space. If such a fighter jet really existed, the air force of the great sea kingdom will definitely become the air force hijgeman of blue star. Lie Jiano smiled and echoed. Old Blue Shaolin isn&#x27;t joking.</p>
<p>The Bitey project has been approved and is almost ready for assembly. The US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jets are nothing but garbage compared to the White Emperor&#x27;s space fighters. Commander Lu was stunned for a moment, then became excited. He stroed up to Lynshan and grabbed Lynshen&#x27;s arms with both hands. Chief Engineer Lynn, is this all true? When will the White Emperor fighter jet make its maiden flight? Lynn Shan patted his hand reassuringly.</p>
<p>Commander Lou, don&#x27;t worry. The components of BY are all being processed and will be assembled soon. Isn&#x27;t the US planning to make the maiden flight of its sixth generation fighter jet on New Year&#x27;s Day? At that time, we will prepare a big surprise for the Air Force and the people of the whole country. A big surprise? Commander Lu was stunned, then realized what was happening, and his eyes flashed with an astonishing light. Chief Engineer Lynn, you mean? Lynch nodded, a smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>At that time, well make the maiden flight of the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet a joke. Let the whole world see who is the true overlord of the blue stars skies. Lie Jian Guo chimed in from the side. That&#x27;s right, Luli. Just wait for the good news.</p>
<p>When our white emperor makes his debut, he&#x27;ll leave the US dumbfounded. Seeing the two men&#x27;s confident demeanor, Commander Lu finally felt relieved. He let out a long sigh of relief, a smile of excitement spreading across his face. Great. Great.</p>
<p>With Chief Engineer Lynn&#x27;s words, I can rest assured. I&#x27;m going back right now to tell the brothers the good news. He turned and left, his steps lighter than when he came, muttering to himself. In the office, Lie Jian Guo watched Commander Lou&#x27;s retreating figure, then smiled and shook his head. Old Lu is like a child.</p>
<p>Lynchin picked up the design drawings again, his eyes resolute. New Year&#x27;s Day is coming soon. Didn&#x27;t OP want to become a technological superpower? I&#x27;ll show him what real strength is. Lie Jian Guo nodded, his eyes full of anticipation. Yes, I can&#x27;t wait any longer.</p>
<p>I really want to see what kind of expression the US will have when it sees the White Emperor. Lynchin looked up and gazed out the window. Sunlight shone on the buildings in the RD area, making them sparkle. They will learn that the skies of the Great Sea Kingdom are not a place for just anyone to run wild. Even without new fighter jets, we can still protect this sky.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s all wait and see the big fireworks. Meanwhile, in the White House, OP is still basking in the glory of the first flight of the sixth generation fighter jet. He looked out the window, his eyes full of smuggness. Great Sia Kingdom, just wait to be surpassed. We will always be the rulers of Earth.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to him, a surprise that he would never forget was quietly preparing. The sky on New Year&#x27;s Day is destined to be anything but peaceful. Chapter 70. The star skycar company is established. One day before New Year&#x27;s Day, conference room of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology building of the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>The heating was on full blast, but it couldn&#x27;t quell the restlessness throughout the house. Via Diwong held a thermos cup and closed his eyes to rest. He seemed to be thinking about something. Mr. Lee, the general manager of Chong, kept checking his watch, appearing somewhat impatient.</p>
<p>The CEOs of domestic automakers such as Jile, SIC, GAC, and BIC were all sitting in the conference room. They looked at each other puzzled, none of them knowing the topic of the meeting. Is everyone here? Minister Chun from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology pushed open the door and entered holding an official document in his hand. I&#x27;ve called you all here today to announce something important. He slammed the document down on the table, his voice firm and resolute.</p>
<p>Siaki Yuan is leading the establishment of Starry Sky Flying Car Company to develop civilian anti-gravity flying cars. Anti-gravity flying car. Mr. Wong was stunned, then asked doubtfully, &quot;Minister Chun, are you kidding me? Isn&#x27;t that something from science fiction? New energy flying cars haven&#x27;t even solved the problems of range and safety yet. So, what&#x27;s the point of developing anti-gravity flying cars? Isn&#x27;t this a bit too big a leap? Has the SEA Academy of Sciences developed some new technology? Other car company executives were also skeptical.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve heard of flying cars, and some car companies are even working on them. But what on earth is this anti-gravity flying car? Just hearing the name makes me want to go for science fiction. Minister Chin did not answer directly, but instead press the projector button. A design blueprint for a civilian flying car pops up on the screen. The streamlined body features a miniature anti-gravity engine at the bottom with a small label next to it stating 5,000 km range, fully autonomous driving, and a top speed of Mach 5.</p>
<p>This is the proposal put forward by the Xiaaw Academy of Sciences. The moment Minister Chin finished speaking, the conference room erupted in chaos. 5,000 km range. Mr. Jang swallowed hard, unable to believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Mock 5: Mr. Wong exclaimed in shock. The other car company executives were stunned and dumbfounded. What did they do to them? This isn&#x27;t a flying car at all. Cuttingedge technology that you can only see in science fiction movies.</p>
<p>Even new energy sources are not yet widespread. Skip over new energy vehicles and go straight to developing sci-fi flying cars. This is absolutely outrageous. The CEOs of these car companies all felt that the data was too fake. Minister Chun, observing their reactions, patiently explained, &quot;Everyone, the technology is fine.</p>
<p>The Sia Academy of Sciences will cover all costs. You only need to focus on production.&quot; After hearing Minister Chin&#x27;s explanation, the car companies finally believed it. Minister Chun then stopped wasting time and directly outlined the equity distribution method. Shingchin Technology, a subsidiary of the Shaman Academy of Sciences, contributed its technology as equity, holding a 30% stake. The remaining 70% will be split equally among the car manufacturers.</p>
<p>Equally, Mr. Wong SI lit up and he said loudly, &quot;I own 15% of the shares, more than 80. We have a battery production line that can quickly adapt to solidstate magnetic field batteries. Why should you take 15%.&quot; General manager Lee exclaimed anxiously. Chongqin has experience in vehicle manufacturing.</p>
<p>We can modify the production line. Stop arguing. General manager Jeang pulled out his tablet. Jill has long been involved in lowaltitude transportation. When it comes to market research, no one can beat us.</p>
<p>The meeting room was in complete chaos. The CEOs, who were previously keeping a composed demeanor, are now like children scrambling for candy. Minister Chun, observing the scene, gestured for them to leave. All right. The equity will be adjusted slightly according to the revenue ratio.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll sign the contract tomorrow. Remember, this is for the sake of the great SIA automobile industry. Don&#x27;t let it lead to internal strife. All right. Since Minister Chun had spoken, they had no choice but to give up the argument.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be kicked out. That afternoon, Chinese automakers have announced the termination of all research and development projects for gasoline powered vehicles and new energy vehicles. The production line was closed for a holiday and technical upgrades were carried out overnight. The collective actions of several car companies in the Great Sea Kingdom have shocked the world. Netzens in the great Sea Kingdom were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on with these car companies? Why did they suddenly stop all their gasoline powered vehicle projects? Could it be an order from the government? Or have they come up with some new technology again? It definitely is. Could it be a new high-tech car? I can&#x27;t wait. The people of Great Sia were surprised by the car company&#x27;s actions, but more than anything, people are looking forward to what new cars automakers will launch next. Volkswagen headquarters in Germany. The CEO, upon seeing the email from SIC announcing the termination of their partnership, smashed his coffee cup in anger.</p>
<p>Are they crazy? They&#x27;re turning down a multi-billion dollar joint venture project. The assistant handed over another document. Not only Bayotti, but other car companies in the great Sia Kingdom have all stopped their gasoline powered vehicle projects. Investigate. We must find out the truth.</p>
<p>The CEO roared. Toyota, the land of cherry blossoms. President Kishida looked at the news. his face. Ashen is the great Sea Kingdom trying to monopolize the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Tell them that if they dare to cut off parts supply, we&#x27;ll set their automotive industry back 10 years. But the message disappeared without a trace. Dasha Auto Company didn&#x27;t even bother to reply. White House looked at the intelligence report, his brow furrowed. Has the great Sia kingdom gone mad? After thinking for a moment, he felt this was a good opportunity.</p>
<p>immediately issue a notice to sanction their car exports. Secretary of State Raymond frowned. Mr. President, our automakers also have partnerships with Great Sia. If we impose sanctions, ignore it.</p>
<p>ATAP&#x27;s eyes were filled with greed. This is the best opportunity to destroy the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s automotive industry. Soon, the United States took the lead, uniting European and Japanese automakers. The government announced a technology blockade and export ban on Dasha&#x27;s automotive industry. When the news reached Dissa, nizens were amused.</p>
<p>Huh? Sanctions. Who cares about their bans? Anyway, we don&#x27;t export many cars, so let them impose sanctions. Domestic automakers must be making such big moves because they have new projects waiting for the new car to be launched. The actions of the Chinese automakers were quickly overshadowed by news of the maiden flight of the US sixth generation fighter jet on New Year&#x27;s Day on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean. The sixth generation fighter jet is parked on the aircraft carrier runway, its fuselage painted with a silver gray coating, looking very imposing.</p>
<p>Optep himself arrived, stood in front of the microphone, and spoke arrogantly into the live broadcast camera. Today, we want the whole world to know that we will always be the technological superpower of Earth. The audience erupted in enthusiastic applause. The viewers in the live stream went wild. Oh my god, the government didn&#x27;t lie to us.</p>
<p>Haha, great. Our sixth generation fighter jet is finally going to make its maiden flight. Great Sia Kingdom, do you see? We will always be the technological hijgemon of Blue Star. Our sixth generation fighter jet made its maiden flight from an aircraft carrier. Do you have one? Nizens from other countries joined in the mockery.</p>
<p>A South Korean nizen commented, &quot;People of Great Sea, let&#x27;s see if you dare to be arrogant again. Watch out. My American daddy will beat you up.&quot; A nizen from Japan commented, &quot;Yash, great kingdom, can you still defend your airspace?&quot; Philippine nizens, Eagle Boss, avenge us. Faced with ridicule from nizens in those countries. Unlike in the past, nizens from the great Sa Kingdom did not rush to retaliate, but remained unusually calm.</p>
<p>He don&#x27;t get too excited yet, or they might just put on a huge fireworks display right there. Exactly. Getting excited before even taking off could lead to disaster. Even if you successfully take off, what good will it do? Do you dare to come to our great Sea Kingdom? Chapter 71. Sixth generation jet first flight successful invasion of Great Sea.</p>
<p>No matter how excited the live stream was on the aircraft carrier deck, OTEP stared at the silver gray sixth generation fighter jet on the runway, his eyes filled with excitement. I glanced at the time. Optep excitedly announced to the live broadcast. I hereby declare the maiden flight of Earth&#x27;s first and most powerful fighter jet commits. By the end, OTP practically roared.</p>
<p>He knew it perfectly well. As long as this maiden flight is successful, the frustration of being surpassed by the great Sia Kingdom will disappear at this moment, their United States, the United States has once again regained its position as the technological hijgemon of the world. No one can shake it. Inside the cockpit of a fighter jet, pilot Thompson looked at the various control buttons in the cockpit, his eyes filled with excitement. Upon hearing Otep&#x27;s command, he shouted excitedly, &quot;Twer! Tower! Falcon 1 is requesting takeoff.</p>
<p>Falcon 1, clearance for takeoff. Thompson&#x27;s voice was filled with excitement. Roger. Falcon 1, prepare for liftoff. He was an ace in the US Air Force and never failed in his career from flying the F16 to the F35 to the B2 bomber.</p>
<p>Now piloting the world&#x27;s first sixth generation fighter jet on its maiden flight. This will be a glorious chapter in his career. Thompson pressed the start button. The engine emitted a deep roar like a slumbering beast awakening. The deck trembled and the silver gray fuselage rose slightly.</p>
<p>Vertical takeoff procedure activated. The fighter jets engines emitted pale blue exhaust as the fuselage slowly lifted off the deck. The live stream chat instantly went wild with comments flooding the screen so fast they were almost illeible. Oh my god, our sixth generation fighter jet can still take off and land vertically. Haha, that&#x27;s so advanced.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll have another vertical takeoff and landing fighter jet now. The US is awesome. Number one in the world on the fighter jet 200 meters above the ground. Thompson slammed the putter down. The fighter jets shot straight into the sky like arrows released from a bow.</p>
<p>The speedometer jumped wildly. Mach 1, Mach 2, Mach 3. The deafening roar of breaking the sound barrier exploded on the sea surface. After experiencing a sharp, jarring push, Thompson looked out the window at the rapidly receding clouds and couldn&#x27;t help but roar. This is awesome.</p>
<p>This is a real fighter jet. Inside the aircraft carrier&#x27;s command center, stared at the red dot on the radar screen, his face filled with excitement. We did it. We did it. The high-ranking military officers nearby gathered around, their faces flushed red.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this is a historic moment. Those outdated weapons of the great Sia Kingdom are nothing but scrap metal in front of our sixth generation fighter jets. OTP raised his hand to interrupt them, his eyes filled with malice. It&#x27;s not over yet.</p>
<p>He picked up the satellite phone and dialed Thompson&#x27;s communications channel directly. In the live stream, the American public has completely lost their minds. Oh my god, Mach 5. That&#x27;s twice the speed of a fifth generation fighter. That&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>I knew it. We&#x27;ll always be number one on earth. People of great sia, do you see this? This is a gap you can never overcome. Japanese nizens joined in the celebration. Wow, our American daddy is too awesome.</p>
<p>China is doomed. South Korean nizens flooded the comments section with the US&#x27;s technology is a 100red years ahead of the world. Only the great SEA Kingdom&#x27;s live stream remained unusually calm. There were no cheers, no insults, only a silence that was almost oppressive. Viewers from the Great Sea Kingdom watching the live stream were all intently focused on the silver gray fighter jet weaving through the clouds.</p>
<p>Everyone hoped that the fighter jet would explode and disintegrate in midair. Unfortunately, they can only dream about it. There were no unexpected issues with the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet. They even performed various difficult moves inside the cockpit of Falcon 1. Suddenly, ATAP&#x27;s voice came through Thompson&#x27;s headphones.</p>
<p>Falcon 1, change course. Thompson was taken aback then quickly replied, &quot;Mr. President, the target airspace is the planned airspace over the Pacific Ocean. Changing the flight path would deviate from the plan.&quot; OTEP&#x27;s voice carried an unquestionable command. &quot;I want you to fly into the edge of the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s airspace and circle around it.&quot; Thompson&#x27;s pupils contracted sharply, and his voice trembled.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. President, this is a provocation. It will provoke a conflict.&quot; &quot;Conflict!&quot; Otep sneered. That&#x27;s exactly what I want. Let the great Sia Kingdom see that our sixth generation fighter jets can fly freely outside their airspace.</p>
<p>They dare not make a move, nor are they capable of making a move. Thompson gritted his teeth and jerked the lever. The fighter jet drew an arc in the air and flew towards the airspace of the Great Sea Kingdom. On the radar screen, the red dot gradually approached the airspace boundary of the Great Sa Kingdom. Inside the aircraft carrier&#x27;s command center, ATP stared intently at the screen.</p>
<p>a cruel smile playing on his lips. He wanted the whole world to see that the US military aircraft could swagger around right on the doorstep of the great Sia Kingdom. He wants to plunge the people of the great Sia Kingdom into fear. In the live stream, the audience noticed that the fighter jets were beginning to veer off course. Moreover, the direction was precisely the direction of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Instantly, the already bustling live stream exploded like boiling oil being poured into boiling water. American nizens were stunned. Did the pilot make a mistake? Why are they flying towards the great Sea Kingdom? Is the military planning something again? The Great Sea Kingdom has laser weapons. What if they get shot down? What&#x27;s there to be afraid of? Our sixth generation fighter jet uses a new type of stealth coating, and the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s radar definitely can&#x27;t lock onto it. Some American nizens are starting to worry.</p>
<p>However, most American nizens are confident in their sixth generation fighter jet. They believed that the sixth generation fighter jet equipped with the latest stealth coding was already invincible. The radar of the great sea kingdom could not lock onto their sixth generation fighter jets at all. Other nizens from the US-led alliance also got excited. Great.</p>
<p>The US is finally going to start something big. I can&#x27;t wait. Yoshi, our American daddy is going to avenge us. Good. Let&#x27;s see how the great Sia Kingdom will be humiliated this time.</p>
<p>They seem to have already seen the frustration of the Great Sea Kingdom being unable to lock onto American fighter jets after they entered its airspace. This way, they can get revenge for the previous South China Sea incident. At the same time, nizens from the Great Sea Kingdom also got excited. Holy crap, American war plananes are really flying into our airspace. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Huh. Let&#x27;s see how the US sixth generation fighter jets die this time. We thought they wouldn&#x27;t cause any trouble and that we were helpless against them, but they actually came to us on their own. When nizens from the Great Sia Kingdom saw this scene, they weren&#x27;t worried or frustrated. Instead, they were filled with excitement because they know that the laser weapons of the Great Sia Kingdom are already powerful enough.</p>
<p>If any of America&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jets dare to enter the airspace of Great Sea, they will definitely be destroyed. Aircraft carrier command center. OTP watched as the red dot on the satellite monitoring screen drew closer and closer to the Great Sea Kingdom. Almost there. We&#x27;ll be in the airspace of the Great Sea Kingdom soon.</p>
<p>So, what if your laser weapons are powerful? If they can&#x27;t lock onto our fighter jets, they&#x27;re just scrap metal. This time, we must make the Great Sea Kingdom truly understand who the real overlord of Blue Star is. Huh? OTP was having wild fantasies. If he weren&#x27;t in front of the live stream camera and had to maintain a certain image, he would laugh out loud. In his view, the great Sea Kingdom was destined to lose face on the international stage this time.</p>
<p>Chapter 72. The Air Force&#x27;s frustration. Lynch, shoot it down over the Pacific Ocean. The engine roar of Falcon 1 pierced the clouds. Thompson stared at the dashboard, his eyes filled with excitement and anticipation.</p>
<p>The radar screen was blank. This proves that the device is not locked. Great. The new stealth coding is really impressive. We&#x27;re only 100 km away from entering the airspace of the Great Sea Kingdom and we still haven&#x27;t been detected.</p>
<p>If it&#x27;s an older fifth generation aircraft, they will be detected as soon as they get within 500 km of the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s airspace. It&#x27;s already 100 km away. The radar of the Great Sea Kingdom has not yet reacted. This proves that their sixth generation fighter jet stealth capabilities have once again reached a new level, enough to sweep across the entire Earth. Seeing that they were about to enter the airspace of the Great Sea Kingdom, Thompson couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Twer, we&#x27;re about to enter the airspace of the Great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Should we continue?&quot; The control tower remained silent for 2 seconds. Then came Otep&#x27;s frantic voice. Fly in. This time we must make the Great Sa Kingdom lose face on the international stage. receive.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, Thompson continued to maneuver his fighter jet toward the airspace of the Great Sia Kingdom. However, he also started to get a little nervous. Be cautious and fully focused. Once he is targeted by the Great Sa Kingdom, he will immediately take counter measures. Aircraft carrier command center.</p>
<p>After hanging up the call, OTP&#x27;s eyes were filled with madness. At that moment, he didn&#x27;t act like a president at all. He&#x27;s more like a madman who&#x27;s willing to do anything for revenge. It&#x27;s like someone has developed scenile dementia. The surrounding officers could only shake their heads helplessly.</p>
<p>They had considered trying to persuade Otap, but it didn&#x27;t work. OTP, caught up in his madness, wouldn&#x27;t listen to a word. As high-ranking military officials, they actually hoped that the maiden flight would go smoothly. Instead of provoking the Great Sea Kingdom again, does anyone know if the Great Sea Kingdom has any new cuttingedge technologies? What if the Great Sea Kingdom also makes a breakthrough in radar technology? Wouldn&#x27;t that mean the Falcon won is? They dared not think any further. All I can do is pray to the free woman in my heart that things will go smoothly this time.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom, Eastern Theater Command, Air Force Base. The atmosphere in the command room was extremely tense. Nothing was detected on the radar screen. Jang Tao is the base&#x27;s operation staff officer. In his 30 years of military service, this is the first time he has felt so frustrated.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s the satellite? Has the optical satellite detected it? The technician shook his head and said with a ry smile, reporting to the staff officer, &quot;Nothing has been found.&quot; &quot;Are the stealth capabilities of the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jets really that good? They&#x27;re practically flying to our doorstep, and our radar and satellites still can&#x27;t detect them.&quot; Jeang Tao gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with resentment. The Navy had clearly made a major breakthrough, defeating the US-led coalition fleet and sending them running for their lives. But the air force had just caught up with the US and now it&#x27;s fallen behind again. This feeling is so frustrating. He stared at the red line on the map that represented the airspace of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>His eyes filled with resentment. Notify J 20 formation to take off immediately. Even if we can&#x27;t see it, we must patrol the edge of our airspace. We can&#x27;t let them be so arrogant. Jeang Tao gave the order with a sense of helplessness.</p>
<p>This is a last resort. If they could pinpoint the target, they wouldn&#x27;t resort to such a blind men and the elephant approach. But right now, there&#x27;s no better way. Radar and satellites are like blind men. The only option is to use fighter jets to force our way through.</p>
<p>Soon, J 20 formations from the air force base took off urgently. The roar was deafening, but it couldn&#x27;t suppress the oppressive atmosphere in the command room. Then, Jeang Tao reported this news to his superiors. Xiaaki Yuan test site for super laser cannon. In the open field, a superpowered laser cannon stood like a silent behemoth.</p>
<p>Lynchin stood in front of the control panel, continuously issuing commands. White Emperor continue to accelerate the target lock and strive to break through 0.1 seconds. Receive on the console screen. The blue virtual human image of White Emperor responded just like a normal person. Target locked.</p>
<p>0.05 seconds. Lynchan nodded about to speak. My phone suddenly rang in my pocket. He picked it up and saw it was Lie Jang Wos phone number so he answered it without hesitation. Kobayashi, something&#x27;s happened.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos voice was filled with anxiety. The US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet has successfully completed its maiden flight, but it is flying towards our airspace, very close. The military region&#x27;s radar and satellites cannot lock onto the other side, so the military is asking us for help. Upon hearing this, Lynchin&#x27;s eyes instantly turned cold. Mr.</p>
<p>Lee, I understand. I&#x27;ll handle this. After hanging up the phone, Lynchin gave instructions to White Emperor. White Emperor, switch to combat mode. Lock onto the direction over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Receive. The images on the screen switched instantly. The previously blank display screen suddenly showed a 3D fighter jet model. It is the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet. Lynchan looked at the American fighter jets on the screen and continued to issue commands.</p>
<p>White Emperor, charge the laser cannon. Destroy that fighter jet as soon as it enters our airspace. The words had barely left his mouth. The engineers instantly erupted in excitement. Chief engineer Lynn, are we really going to take it down? Haha.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve disliked the US for a long time. They even dared to invade our airspace. They deserve to be punished. Once we shoot down the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet, let&#x27;s see how arrogant they still are. All the engineers were filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>No one objected to Lin Chin&#x27;s instructions. When they excited, White Emperor has begun to carry out orders. The laser cannon slowly rotated, aiming at the direction of the US 6th generation fighter jet. Blue energy gathered at the muzzle, emitting a soft hum. Eastern Theater Command Air Force Base.</p>
<p>Jong Tao&#x27;s phone suddenly rang. It was Commander Lu from the Air Force who called, &quot;Officer Jeang, the Seyaku Academy will handle the issue of the US&#x27;s fighter jets. Bring the J20 back.&quot; Jeang Tao was stunned for a moment, then overjoyed. Really? The Academy of Sciences in Sea has a solution. Very good.</p>
<p>After hanging up the phone, Jeang Tao immediately issued the following order. J 20 formation. Return to base immediately. Receive. The oppressive atmosphere in the command room instantly dissipated.</p>
<p>Jeang Taos previous frustration vanished instantly. Instead, an overwhelming excitement arose. Siaki Yuan is really something. This is going to be interesting. Over the Pacific Ocean, Thompson looked at the dashboard with a smug smile on his face.</p>
<p>Well be entering the airspace of the Great Sea Kingdom in 10 km. It seems that the radar of the Great Sa Kingdom really can&#x27;t detect me. I definitely want to take a picture to remember the occasion. Thompson was still gloating. He was unaware that death was already on its way.</p>
<p>Syaku Institute&#x27;s testing site. Lyn Shin stared at the screen, his figure icy. White Emperor, confirm whether the target has entered the airspace. Report to Chief Engineer Lynn. Falcon 1 has crossed the red line of the great SI Kingdoms airspace, currently at a depth of 0.3 km.</p>
<p>Lynchin raised his hand and gave a loud order. Fire. Boom. The laser cannon emitted a dazzling blue light. The beam of light streaked across the sky heading towards the direction of the US 6th generation fighter jets.</p>
<p>Chapter 73. Destroy the US 6th generation fighter jets over the Pacific Ocean on Falcon 1. Thompson stared at the dashboard, his eyes filled with disdain. 5 km 10 km. Haha.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve already entered the airspace of the great Sia Kingdom. He raised his hand and touched the metal on his chest, his eyes full of pride. Once the photos are taken, you&#x27;ll be a hero when you get back. Those media outlets must be praising me to the skies. Dasha&#x27;s radar is useless against our sixth generation fighter jets.</p>
<p>He even started fantasizing about what would happen if he returned to the United States. The president personally presented the award and the crowds lined the streets to welcome him. There are also countless bonuses and honors. Haha. Thompson couldn&#x27;t help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Sudden boom. A laser beam was released and accurately hit the fuselof. The intense heat instantly engulfed the cabin. Thompson didn&#x27;t even have time to scream. His entire body vaporized.</p>
<p>The fuselage of Falcon 1 began to break apart. The left wing fell first, followed by the explosion on the right wing. The engine was belching out thick black smoke. Snap! The fuselage broke into two pieces. It fell into the sea, carrying sparks.</p>
<p>It hadn&#x27;t even landed yet. Bang! Another loud bang! The fuel tank was ignited. The entire fighter jet exploded into a fireball. The fragments fell like rain. The sixth generation fighter jet of the United States, which was just a second ago, claiming to sweep across the blue planet.</p>
<p>It turned into a pile of scrap metal the moment it entered the airspace of the great Sia Kingdom. At the same time, aircraft carrier command center. OTP was still excitedly waiting for the latest news. Soon the sixth generation fighter jets have definitely entered the airspace of the Great Sia Kingdom. The people of Great Sea must be panicking now.</p>
<p>Huh? He imagined the chaos that would engulf the Great Sea Bureau. Imagine the ridicule from international media. I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh out loud. Let&#x27;s see you get cocky. Now you know who the overlord is.</p>
<p>The officers standing nearby had complicated expressions. Some people wanted to offer advice, but seeing OTP&#x27;s frantic state, he swallowed his words. Sudden the radar operator jumped to his feet. His voice trembled. Mr.</p>
<p>President Falcon 1&#x27;s signal is gone. OTP&#x27;s laughter stopped abruptly. He turned around abruptly, his eyes wide as saucers. What did you say? Say it again. The operator was so frightened his legs went weak and he pointed at the radar screen.</p>
<p>The signal has disappeared. It disappeared just a dozen kilometers after entering the airspace of the great Sia Kingdom. There&#x27;s been absolutely no feedback. OTP rushed over and grabbed the operator by the collar. Impossible.</p>
<p>The Falcon 1 has the most advanced stealth coating. The Great Sia&#x27;s radar can&#x27;t find it at all. How could the signal disappear? His face turned a deep purplish red and he spat all over the operator&#x27;s face. The chief of staff next to him looked grim and spoke cautiously. Mr.</p>
<p>President, could it be shot down? Shoot down. Otep turned his head sharply, his eyes looking like he wanted to devour someone. Are you crazy? How dare the people of Great Sa? They can&#x27;t even lock on. How do we shoot it down? The chief of staff dared not speak again, but the worry in his eyes grew stronger. Otep released the operator and staggered back two steps.</p>
<p>He stared at the blank area on the radar screen. I suddenly felt panicked. Check. Check it with satellite immediately. I need to know the whereabouts of Falcon 1.</p>
<p>His voice was trembling as he spoke. His previous arrogance and madness have completely vanished. All that remained was panic and fear. The communication soldier next to him nodded hurriedly and frantically went to contact the reconnaissance plane. The command room was deathly silent.</p>
<p>Only Otep&#x27;s heavy breathing could be heard. He looked out the window at the sea where the waves were surging. It&#x27;s like a giant mouth about to swallow the entire aircraft carrier. Impossible. It must be a signal malfunction.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#x27;s definitely a malfunction. OTP kept muttering to himself as if trying to comfort himself. But my hands were trembling uncontrollably. He suddenly remembered the incident in the South China Sea. The US-led coalition fleet was terrified by the laser cannons of great sia and fled in disarray.</p>
<p>15 warships of the Sakura Kingdom sank. Laser cannon. Otep felt a chill run through him. Could it be that the great sea people can really use laser cannons to shoot down fighter jets? The moment that thought crossed his mind, he could no longer stand. His legs gave way and he collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>His face was as pale as paper. The officers nearby quickly stepped forward to help him up. President, are you all right? Otep shoved them away, his voice. Did the satellite detect it? Why haven&#x27;t we heard anything yet? Just then the communications soldier stumbled in his face even paler than Otaps. Mr.</p>
<p>President, the images transmitted back by satellite show. Falcon 1 is gone. The sea is covered with wreckage. Otep suddenly looked up. Wreckage, quick, bring up the screen on the big screen.</p>
<p>Soon the image of the sea appeared. Black wreckage floated on the sea. It was still emitting wisps of black smoke. That familiar silver gray coating. It features the exclusive color scheme of the Falcon 1.</p>
<p>Ot stared at the screen, his body beginning to tremble. No, my sixth generation fighter jet. My dominant position. He suddenly started banging on the table frantically. a great SA person.</p>
<p>Why did you dare to do this? His voice was full of anger. The officers around him all had their heads down. No one dared to speak. They knew that the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet had made its maiden flight. Not only did it not bring shame to the great sea kingdom, instead they embarrassed themselves in front of the whole world.</p>
<p>Even more frightening is the great SIA actually possesses weapons capable of shooting down six generation fighter jets. This means the United States air supremacy is completely over. Sudden OTP stopped moving. He suddenly stood up, his eyes fierce. Pass on my orders.</p>
<p>All carrier strike groups assemble in the central Pacific. Also contact all allies. Convene an emergency meeting immediately. The chief of staff was taken aback. President, what are we doing assembling the fleet? What are you doing? Otep sneered, his eyes filled with madness.</p>
<p>Revenge. I will make the people of great Sia pay the price. They destroyed my sixth generation fighter jet. I&#x27;m going to destroy their navy. On the other side, Seyaku Institutees testing site.</p>
<p>Lynchin looked at the wreckage on the screen and nodded in satisfaction. White Emperor, how is the accuracy of that shot? The blue virtual figure on the screen responded immediately, reporting to Chief Engineer Len. 100% accuracy. A single strike hits the core area. Lynch nodded and turned to look at the engineers behind him.</p>
<p>Remember to save all the data you just collected. I will share this as a real life example in the future. If anyone dares to cause trouble in the Great Sa Kingdom again in the future, just wipe them out. The engineers cheered instantly. Chief designer Lynn is awesome.</p>
<p>Great Sia is awesome. Let&#x27;s see if they dare to come again. The cheers were deafening. Lynn Shan raised his hand to smother the conversation and continued. There are more important things to do.</p>
<p>The assembly of the bitey aerospace fighter jet needs to be accelerated. The engineers immediately stopped smiling, their eyes hardening. Don&#x27;t worry, Chief Engineer Lynn. Mission accomplished. Lynnshin looked at everyone and made a silent decision in his heart.</p>
<p>We must never let the great Sia kingdom suffer any injustice again. Even the US won&#x27;t do. Whoever comes dies. Chapter 74. Though far away, we will surely punish them.</p>
<p>The US s global live stream was in complete chaos. The most excited were the netzens from DSA who flooded the screen with comments. Holy crap, it really exploded. The US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet just disappeared like that. Who just said the US&#x27;s stealth coding is invincible? Come out and show yourself.</p>
<p>Haha, I guessed right. It really got bombed. Weren&#x27;t American nizens so arrogant before? Why are they silent now? Some people directly posted screenshots. All the comments that had previously been despising China in the US live stream room have disappeared. Does your face hurt? That&#x27;s good.</p>
<p>Those who offend our great SEA, no matter how powerful, shall be punished. Even veterans who usually dive came out. After so many years since I was discharged from the military, I&#x27;ve finally seen this day. It&#x27;s so satisfying. Let&#x27;s see if they dare to come back again.</p>
<p>Awesome. American nizens saw this news. One second they were celebrating. The next they were all dumbfounded. All American nizens couldn&#x27;t believe the fact that their sixth generation fighter jet had been destroyed.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, American nizens came to their senses. this must be fake. It&#x27;s AI generated. How could our sixth generation fighter jet have been shot down? Impossible. Falcon 1 has the most advanced stealth technology.</p>
<p>No one on Earth can lock onto it. It must be fake. Where&#x27;s the satellite footage? Let us see the real footage. But where did the real footage come from? How could the US government possibly release this information? All American nizens want a positive response from the American government. Japanese nizens were completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Damn it. How could the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet have crashed? It must be fake. That&#x27;s right. This must be fake. How could they be so powerful? The Americans will definitely avenge us.</p>
<p>They must pay the price. Even at this moment, the Japanese devils were still unwilling to give up. He still wanted revenge. Many Japanese even suggested that their country should retaliate directly, but there was no response. At the same time, South Korean nizens seemed to have survived a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Damn it. Thank goodness we didn&#x27;t follow the US and causing trouble. They used to want to seize interests in the South China Sea, but now I&#x27;m terrified when I think about it. Meanwhile, nizens from neutral countries were all expressing their feelings. They&#x27;ve truly risen to power.</p>
<p>From now on, Earth will no longer be solely controlled by the United States. At the Seiaku Academy, Li Jang Wo had just received the 3D visual radar footage sent by Lynch. He froze, dropping his teacup to the ground. They they really won. He stared at the wreckage on the sea surface on the screen, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t just excitement, it was awe. We were worried about the US 6th generation fighter jet provoking us. And today it was shot down. Great. Great.</p>
<p>Kobayashi really didn&#x27;t disappoint me. He actually got it sorted out. This surprise is a bit too big. After his initial excitement, Lie Jian Guo was filled with emotion. As for the consequences, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Anyone who dares to come now will suffer the same fate as the Japanese fleet last time. With Lynchin around, there&#x27;s no need to be timid anymore. We must go out and strike, and we must make them suffer. Then, Lie Jang Guo took out his phone and dialed Commander Lou&#x27;s number. He wanted to tell Commander Lu the good news.</p>
<p>Inside the Air Force headquarters, Commander Lu stared intently at the radar screen, his eyes filled with anticipation. Siaki Yuan said, &quot;There&#x27;s a solution. He also wanted to see what method the Sia Academy of Sciences would use. Suddenly, his phone rang. Seeing that it was Lie Jian Guo, he quickly answered it.</p>
<p>Dean Lee, is there good news? Yes, Commander Lu. Falcon 1 has been shot down. What? Commander Lu was stunned. What did you say? You took it down? How did you take it down? We were testing our new radar and it was shot down in conjunction with our laser cannon. Li Jang Wos voice was filled with pride.</p>
<p>The images are clear, absolutely real. Commander Lu suddenly stood up, his eyes brimming with excitement. Great, great. Let the Americans gloat. Let&#x27;s see how they cry this time.</p>
<p>Huh? Hang up the phone. Commander Lou immediately informed the other officers. All the officers were instantly excited upon hearing the news. Huh, that&#x27;s awesome. That&#x27;s awesome.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see if the US dares to send planes into our airspace again. The entire headquarters was filled with cheers. After his initial excitement, Commander Lou immediately reported the situation to the military headquarters. The military headquarters was slightly shocked when they received the news. Then they immediately ordered the issuance of an announcement inside the command center of an American aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>OTEP has completely gone mad. Damn it. This revenge must be taken. Have you contacted all your allies? Are we ready to hold a meeting? The chief of staff stood beside him, his face grim. Mr.</p>
<p>President, our allies are hesitant. They saw Falcon 1 shot down and are afraid to make a move. Hesitate? Otep&#x27;s face darkened further. Have they forgotten who provided them with protection? Now they dare to hesitate. Just then, the communications soldier stumbled in carrying a tablet computer, his face pale.</p>
<p>President, Mister, the Great Sa Kingdom has issued a proclamation. What announcement did they release? Otep asked, his face darkening as he snatched the tablet. The announcement on the screen was particularly eye-catching. Any country&#x27;s military forces entering its airspace or territorial waters without permission shall be considered an invasion. All weapons used for invasion, regardless of their sophistication, shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>Those who attempt to intrude will bear the consequences themselves. We don&#x27;t provoke trouble, but we&#x27;re absolutely not afraid of it. Any invading enemy, no matter how far away, shall be punished. Just a few lines. This made Optep&#x27;s face turn as black as ink.</p>
<p>He never dreamed that the East would be so tough one day. They&#x27;ve done this many times before, warplanes intruding into their airspace. But all they ever did was shout and drive them away. He thought it would be the same this time. I never expected things to turn out so badly.</p>
<p>The sixth generation fighter jet made its maiden flight, aiming to demonstrate its strength to the world, but was instead destroyed. Instead of successfully demonstrating its strength, it became a global laughing stock. Thinking of this, OTP&#x27;s face grew even more gloomy. Damn it, they deserve to die. No country has ever dared to threaten the US like this.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t exist before, and it definitely shouldn&#x27;t exist now. Staff officer, just as Otto was about to give the order, he was interrupted by Defense Secretary Pete, who said, &quot;President, I advise you to be cautious. Have you forgotten how the Japanese fleet was destroyed before? Are you sure our carrier battle group can intercept their laser cannons? Upon hearing this, OTP instantly snapped out of his days. The South China Sea incident in which 15 Japanese warships were destroyed kept replaying in his mind. Just now, Falcon 1 was destroyed and disintegrated as soon as it entered our airspace.</p>
<p>Everything proves that they weren&#x27;t just bragging. They really meant what they said. The more Otto felt, the more a chill ran down his spine. This matter must be handled with caution. At that moment, the staff officer asked in a low voice, &quot;President, is the fleet still assembling?&quot; Chapter 75.</p>
<p>The US loses its dominance. Upon hearing this, OTP immediately flew into a rage. Are you an idiot? Are you sending your fleet to your death? Immediately cancel the order, notify allies to suspend the meeting, and return home as quickly as possible. also issue a statement saying that our fighter jet crashed due to mechanical failure. He doesn&#x27;t want to stay in this area of the sea for even a second longer.</p>
<p>Who knows if the great Sea Kingdom will suddenly retaliate. We must get back as soon as possible. At the same time, the announcements from the Great Sea Kingdom in the United States were released one after the other. It instantly caused an uproar among netizens around the world. In the live stream, all the comments from American nizens have disappeared.</p>
<p>Instead, there was only deathly silence. Half a minute later, a few scattered comments began to appear. Mechanical failure? You&#x27;re kidding me. It malfunctioned as soon as it entered Great Sia&#x27;s airspace. What a coincidence.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t they say the stealth coding was invincible? How come they disappeared without even a trace? American nizens are utterly disappointed this time. The Great Sa Kingdom has already issued an announcement. Their American government is actually denying it. make them feel utterly ashamed. Many American nizens immediately left the live stream.</p>
<p>They dared not face the comments from netizens in other countries. Japanese nizens are filled with disappointment. It&#x27;s over. The US has backed down. I was hoping the US would help us get revenge, but this is what we get.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll never dare to call the US my Japanese father again. It&#x27;s too embarrassing. Japanese nizens think that what the US did was shameful. Even if we lose the battle, we won&#x27;t lose face. Even if our fighter jet was shot down by the great sea kingdom, we&#x27;ll just admit it.</p>
<p>They even tried to run away. That&#x27;s so embarrassing. They don&#x27;t care if they don&#x27;t recognize this father. South Korean nitizens also expressed their dismay. Damn it.</p>
<p>Is the US really going to decline? The US used to be our faith, but now alas, our faith has collapsed. It&#x27;s a long story. South Korea has always regarded the United States as its faith. The US military presence in South Korea is like that of a god. Even if you commit a crime, you can be pardoned.</p>
<p>But now the myth of the invincible United States is being broken by the great SEA kingdom. This is something that South Korean nizens simply cannot accept. In their minds, the great Sia Kingdom was a backward and impoverished country. But now it&#x27;s actually on the contrary, nizens from neutral countries understood it better. The US announcement is practically a blatant display of their guilty conscience.</p>
<p>The great SEA kingdom saying though they are far away, they will be punished is not just empty talk. The Falcon one is a prime example. The global landscape is about to change and America&#x27;s hijgemony is truly over. Anyone with eyes can see the difference in credibility between the two announcements. The US S approach is nothing short of selfdeception.</p>
<p>It has had no effect whatsoever and will only cause their international credibility to plummet. On the other side, nizens in the great SEA Kingdom are in a frenzy. Haha. The US&#x27;s ability to lie through its teeth is truly unparalleled. Weren&#x27;t you arrogant before? How come you don&#x27;t even have the courage to admit it now? Those who offend our great SEA, though far away, shall be punished.</p>
<p>These words were tailor made for them. The red great SEA is awesome slogan is trending again filling the screen with enthusiasm. Many people in the great sea kingdom spread the news. I&#x27;ve never felt so good before. During this period, the US has suffered repeated losses and lost face.</p>
<p>This allowed the people of the great sea kingdom to deeply appreciate the benefits brought about by technological breakthroughs. On social media, a flood of celebratory and proud posts emerged. The entire Great Sea Kingdom was celebrating as if it were Chinese New Year. Meanwhile, within the United States, the situation was completely outrageous. Large numbers of American citizens took to the streets to display banners.</p>
<p>Are all those old men in the government idiots? They&#x27;ve embarrassed us on the international stage again. You have to explain this to us. Atep stepped down. Many people felt they had been hit hard and demanded that the government reveal the truth. Many black men even took the opportunity to buy things for free.</p>
<p>A few hours later, White House. Otep had just gotten off the plane. His face was terribly gloomy as he stroed into the conference room. On the way back, I had my secretary make all the arrangements. OTP sat down, his eyes scanning the entire room.</p>
<p>Our Falcon 1 is gone. You have all seen the announcement from the great Sia Kingdom. There&#x27;s a huge outcry in China right now. What do you suggest we do? Defense Secretary Pit frowned as he spoke. Mr.</p>
<p>President, we need to increase investment in research and development to achieve another technological breakthrough. Before he could finish speaking, OTP slammed his fist on the table, interrupting him abruptly. Increase investment. Where&#x27;s the money? The previous research and development budget has already been exceeded. Besides, if the Great Sa Kingdom can fight sixth generation fighters, it might have even more powerful weapons.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t even know what technological breakthroughs the Great Sea Kingdom has made. So, how can we invest in it? It&#x27;s not that he doesn&#x27;t want to increase investment. Rather, they simply lack any direction. I thought the sixth generation machine would be far superior to the great Sia Kingdom. But now, it seems that the great Sia Kingdom has made breakthroughs not only in weaponry.</p>
<p>Even in the field of radar, significant breakthroughs have been achieved. How could their sixth generation fighter jets have been detected? Unless, but that unrealistic idea was quickly rejected. After all, they had already conducted test flights in the country before their maiden flight. Even their own radar couldn&#x27;t lock onto it. I certainly won&#x27;t make that kind of basic mistake.</p>
<p>While OTP was upset, Secretary of State Raymond Domino began by saying, &quot;Mr. President, how about we shift the focus of our attention? Isn&#x27;t the desert region always quite unstable? We&#x27;ll send our fleet over there, win a few battles, and then the domestic attention will be diverted.&quot; OTP&#x27;s eyes lit up instantly. Desert region? Yes. The Secretary of State nodded. Those countries have been trying to distance themselves from us lately.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to teach them a lesson. As long as we achieve a major victory in the desert region, the domestic conflicts will naturally disappear. OTP stood up and paced back and forth in the conference room. After a moment, he stopped. &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s do it this way.</p>
<p>Order the Sixth Fleet to proceed to the desert region immediately. Find an excuse and give those disobedient countries a good beating. They the Americans can&#x27;t do anything about great sia. But dealing with those small kurami in the desert is a piece of cake. This is a perfect opportunity to make up for all the losses we&#x27;ve incurred during this period.</p>
<p>At this moment, NASA administrator Durut suddenly spoke up. Mr. President, we have another way. We can announce the restart of the moon landing program using space achievements to divert public attention. At the same time, just like we brought down the former great Russia, we can make the great SIA kingdom compete with us in space.</p>
<p>OTP turned his head, his brow furrowing slightly. The moon landing, the space race. Yes. NASA administrator Trudeau exclaimed excitedly. Our starship is in its final stages and will soon be ready for its first test flight.</p>
<p>With increased investment, we can achieve another moon landing very soon. At that time, we can attract the great SA kingdom to engage in a space race with us. This will help alleviate our current predicament. After hearing the explanation, OTP smiled. Great.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s wonderful. Have NASA issue a statement immediately. Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;ll land on the moon again within 6 months. We also want to establish a base on the moon. At the same time, military operations are being carried out simultaneously in the desert region.</p>
<p>He wants to refocus the world&#x27;s attention on the US military. Chapter 76, the space race. Nations fall into the trap. The White House meeting has ended. NASA, the US Space Agency, issued a statement.</p>
<p>One month later, the Starship rocket made its maiden test flight, land on the moon, and establish a lunar base within 6 months to explore Mars within 5 years. The American public instantly erupted in excitement. The American citizens who were originally marching began to cheer. Oh my god, we&#x27;re going to conquer the moon again. Haha.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful the Great Sea Kingdom is, can you send people to the moon? As long as we establish a lunar base first, the moon will belong to our American nation. Build a lunar base and colonize Mars. The attention of all Americans was immediately diverted. They firmly believed in this announcement. US had already landed on the moon in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Even though it has been debunked by many scientists over the years, the American public remains convinced that it is true. They believe that the US has the capability to achieve this. It&#x27;s not just the American public who are celebrating. Even the little idiot from Sakura country instantly changed his tune. Wow, our American daddy is amazing.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s even preparing to go to the moon and establish a base. The great SA kingdom has made you arrogant. Let&#x27;s see how you deal with this. The tech superpowers all use the cloud because of our American daddy. The little idiots from Japan have this kind of inherently cervil nature.</p>
<p>They were clearly being bullied by the US. But they also have an extreme admiration for the US. They view the US as an omnipotent superpower. Even South Korea is starting to regain its confidence. Damn it.</p>
<p>The US always surprises us. Great. Let&#x27;s see how the great Sia Kingdom can catch up now. In space technology, the US will always be the best. A large number of South Koreans began to mock the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Everyone believes that this time the Great Sia Kingdom will definitely not be able to catch up with the United States. Nizens from neutral countries mostly remain silent. A few people couldn&#x27;t help but sigh. Is the US shifting its focus to space? Will the Great Sea Kingdom accept the challenge? Their previous laser cannons were quite powerful. Could this be another American conspiracy? Many people began to speculate.</p>
<p>The US used this method to bring down Russia as predecessor. Are they trying to repeat the same trick again? Chinese nitizens responded directly to the mockery from South Koreans. I wonder who doesn&#x27;t have their own space station yet. Yeah, the US dares to boast with such low standards. The moon landing was a hoax and now they&#x27;re doing it again.</p>
<p>Hilarious. They even share space stations and they want to land on the moon and build a lunar base within 6 months. The Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s current space technology development is already at the world&#x27;s top level. The only country on the entire planet Earth capable of building its own space station is the Great Sea Kingdom. Therefore, the people of Great SEA are not worried at all about the space technology race.</p>
<p>It even feels like the US is just offering its face to the Great Sea for a slap. It was a really hard pounding, but there are still quite a few people who treat NASA&#x27;s announcement as divine decree. They are wildly cheering for the US online. Haha. Our Ma Shang is finally going to start making a move.</p>
<p>St. Ma is the light of our human civilization. He will lead us out of Earth. Long live Maong. You will always be our guiding light.</p>
<p>Because these exceptionally filial sons know NASA very well. Even all of the space activities of the US space agency rely on Musk space company. It said that the US wants to send people to the moon. In fact, it is Musk who possesses this condition. Moreover, Musk has frequently publicly proclaimed that he will colonize Mars within 5 years.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this that many people regard Musk as a beacon of humanity. In response to these remarks, nizens from the great SEA kingdom were not going to tolerate any of this and immediately launched a massive campaign of reports. At the same time, governments around the world have taken various counter measures. India, the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, Demo, the old immortal is eyes brimming with wisdom. Contact the US immediately.</p>
<p>Tell them we can help them process parts and we&#x27;ll offer a discount. At the same time, we must immediately increase investment in space technology and become the second country to land on the moon. A cabinet member whispered a reminder. Prime Minister, space technology research and development requires a huge investment. We demo the immortal interrupted directly.</p>
<p>No matter how much investment is required, we must participate in this space race. This is the fastest way for us to become a world power. As long as we successfully land on the moon before the great sea kingdom, we will have surpassed the great sea kingdom. In the end, Demo the Immortals eyes were filled with madness. There are only a handful of countries on the entire planet capable of launching their own rockets.</p>
<p>There are only 10 countries in the world, and India is one of them. Only the United States, China, and Russia have manned spaceflight capabilities. This time, Demo&#x27;s goal is to become the fourth country to carry out mann space flight. We also aim to become the second country to achieve a man lunar landing. He wants to skip two stages at once to become a leading power in space technology.</p>
<p>Faced with demo s unwavering resolve, other high-ranking officials in India could only reluctantly agree. Soon, India has begun to increase its investment in space technology. The prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan, Jiro Kishida learns that the United States is about to start a space race. Lost in thought, he quickly guessed the US&#x27;s purpose. Is the US trying to pull the same old trick again? It seems that we in Japan need to give them a push as well.</p>
<p>The home secretary frowned and advised. Prime Minister, we&#x27;re a bit behind in space technology. Is it really appropriate for us to get involved? Kisha Jiro remained unconvinced, his gaze unwavering. We must participate. Only in this way can we get the great SIA kingdom involved.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to catch up. Contact the US and tell them we can cooperate with them. But we need them to provide some technology. All right. The interior minister side inwardly.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go contact the US right away. Jiro Kishida called out to the departing Minister of Home Affairs. Remember to issue a public announcement. We also want to land a man on the moon within 8 years. Yes.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Interior replied and hurriedly left. Jiro Kishida got up and stood by the window, looking into the distance through the glass. Great Sia Kingdom, this time I will surely plunge you into the abyss. Then he returned to his seat, picked up the special phone, and dialed. After the call connected, Jurro Kishida only said one sentence, &quot;Speed up the project.</p>
<p>Then he hung up the phone.&quot; At the same time, the European Union also held an emergency meeting. The atmosphere inside the European Union meeting room was heavy and tense. Representatives from various countries sat around a long table, their faces filled with worry and anticipation. The GA rooster spoke first. Ladies and gentlemen, the US&#x27;s restart of the space race has a clear purpose and we cannot stand idly by.</p>
<p>Space technology is not only about the future of the country, but also about our position on the global stage. Indeed, we cannot let the US dominate the game. Europe must unite to address this challenge. We can integrate the space technology resources of various European countries to establish a joint research institution and concentrate our efforts on tackling key technologies. The meeting lasted for several hours.</p>
<p>Representatives from various countries delivered speeches. They offered many valuable opinions and suggestions. Ultimately, the European Union decided to establish a new space alliance. We should strive to catch up with the great SEA and the United States. At the same time, all countries wanted to see how the great Sia Kingdom would respond.</p>
<p>Chapter 77. Major military regions vive for it. The Great Sea Kingdom military headquarters conference room. The commanders of several major military regions, the rocket force and the air force were all present. In the conference room, everyone was staring at the big screen.</p>
<p>The video showed footage of a superpowered laser cannon destroying a US sixth generation fighter jet. His eyes were full of excitement. After a moment, General Zang spoke first, his voice trembling with excitement. When did the Xia Academy of Sciences develop such an advanced LAR? Doesn&#x27;t any of you know anything about this? At this moment, Air Force Commander Lu chimed in, I have a rough idea. It might be the new radar on the seventh generation fighter jet.</p>
<p>What? What the hell is a seventh generation fighter jet? Aren&#x27;t we still developing a sixth generation fighter jet? Why are we already working on a seventh generation one? And with such advanced radar, wouldn&#x27;t that mean seventh generation fighters? All the military district leaders were filled with surprise. The matter of the seventh generation fighter jet is classified as a secret at the Sia Academy of Sciences. If Air Force Commander Lu hadn&#x27;t gone to finally Gian Guo, he probably wouldn&#x27;t have known. It was Lin Shun who told Commander Lu at the time. Others probably don&#x27;t know yet.</p>
<p>If Lynshin dared to tell us, then it proves that everything is all right. Commander Lu nodded. I guess so. And the maiden flight will be soon. The maiden flight is almost here.</p>
<p>General Ciangs eyes widened. That&#x27;s too fast. Other military region leaders were also shocked, their faces filled with disbelief. This research and development speed is like a rocket launch. It&#x27;s amazing.</p>
<p>Yes, the seventh generation fighter jet is about to make its maiden flight. Just how huge is the technological gap that must have been overcome? What will a seventh generation fighter jet be like? I can&#x27;t wait. The leaders of the various military regions expressed their feelings. Commander Louu felt a surge of satisfaction as he observed their reactions. Finally, they experienced the shock he felt back then.</p>
<p>A moment later, all the military region leaders looked at Minister Chun of the heavy equipment logistics department. Old Shun, can&#x27;t you explain this to us? Minister Chun looked completely bewildered and said with a rise smile, I don&#x27;t know either. You all know that the Xiao Academy is only responsible to the great leader. General Zang stated directly, I don&#x27;t care if our military region deploys a new type of radar. His tone conveyed an air of absolute authority.</p>
<p>Ziao Tiani from the southern GuangDong military region also hurriedly said, &quot;Our military region will also deploy the new radar, and we will be the first to do so. No way.&quot; Commander Xiao of the rocket force retorted without backing down. This time our rocket force must be given priority. The southwest military region and the northwest military region are vying to deploy it. The commanders of the major military regions immediately started arguing.</p>
<p>The sound grew louder and louder. Our southern Guangdong military region is constantly harassed and faces the greatest threat. Our rocket force is of strategic importance and this radar is an essential requirement. Our southwestern border is long, so we need to prioritize our equipment. Only Air Force commander Lou watched them argue with smug satisfaction because the seventh generation fighter jet will eventually be delivered to their air force for use.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no need to argue with them at all. As for the previous fighter jets, there is no need for modification in the face of seventh generation fighters. Perhaps in the future, it can be exported to those neuvo ree in the desert. Let&#x27;s earn some money for the military. Minister Chin also seemed to have a headache.</p>
<p>Everyone says their military region is continuing, but even he doesn&#x27;t know if he has the capability for mass production or how to allocate it. I saw them arguing heatedly. Minister Chin had no choice but to bite the bullet and speak. Quiet down, everyone. We don&#x27;t even know if we can massproduce it now.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the point of arguing here? These words had barely left his lips. The meeting room fell silent instantly. The commanders exchanged glances. They all turned to look at Minister Chun. General Jeang waved his hand.</p>
<p>Old Chun, then what do you suggest we do? Minister Chun rubbed his temples and began to speak. Let me go to the Shaman Academy of Sciences and ask when mass production will begin. We don&#x27;t even know if we can massproduce it. General nodded. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s wait until old Shan sends his regards before we talk. The other military region commanders also had no objections. The reason they are in such a hurry is this is because both the southern Guangdong military region and the southwest military region have deployed new equipment. Thus, they achieved a great victory. That&#x27;s why other military regions are so eager to be the first to deploy new equipment.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s no use arguing about it. There are only two military regions, the southwest military region and the southern GuangDong military region. That&#x27;s when the opportunity for conflict and friction arises. There is unlikely to be any friction in other military regions in the short term. After the meeting, Minister Chun then rushed to the Xiaku Academy.</p>
<p>On the road, Minister Chin&#x27;s eyes gleamed when he saw the announcement released by the United States. Huh. Is the US trying to start another space race? I might have chosen the wrong person this time. Perfect timing. I&#x27;ll ask Chief Engineer Lynn later if he has any counter measures.</p>
<p>Xiaaki Yuan Lin Shan was discussing the assembly of the seventh generation fighter jet in Li Jang Wos office. The seventh generation fighter jet will soon be fully assembled. What are your plans for its maiden flight? After Lie Jian Guo finished speaking, his eyes were full of anticipation. Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;Anything is fine. The maiden flight will definitely be a success.</p>
<p>Should we broadcast the maiden flight live?&quot; Lie Jian Guo asked tentatively. I saw that the US broadcast their maiden flight live. Should we do it, too? Sure. Lynch and nodded. It&#x27;s a perfect opportunity for all Chinese people to witness the groundbreaking fighter jet of our great SI air force.</p>
<p>You agreed? That&#x27;s great. Li Jian Guo exclaimed excitedly. How about we set it for New Year&#x27;s Eve. At this point, there was only one month left until lunar New Year&#x27;s Eve. Based on the assembly speed of the Bitey Aerospace fighter jet, it should definitely be completed by then.</p>
<p>Lynchin agreed. Great. Let&#x27;s consider it a Chinese New Year gift for the people of our country. Okay. Li Jang Guoo was excited and wanted to say something.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the office door. Lie Jian Guo turned to look at the doorway and said, &quot;Come in.&quot; The door opened. Minister Chin walked in and hurriedly said, &quot;Dean Lee, I need to speak with you urgently.&quot; Seeing Lynch sitting to the side, she was instantly delighted. Chief Engineer Lynn is here too. Perfect timing.</p>
<p>Hello, Minister Chun. Lynchin greeted politely. Lie Jian Guo gestured for him to sit down. What&#x27;s the matter that&#x27;s so urgent? Minister Chin sat down, poured himself a cup of tea, took a sip, and said, &quot;The thing is.&quot; After hearing the explanation, Lynchin understood what was going on, and smiled. &quot;Minister Chun, 3D Visual Radar is ready for mass production.</p>
<p>You just need to modify the production line according to the demand, and then you can start production.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; Minister Chun exclaimed excitedly, slapping his thigh. That&#x27;s wonderful. Don&#x27;t worry about the production line. I&#x27;ll take care of it. He thought it would take a long time.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be in mass production already. Then, Minister Chun, recalling the US announcement, continued, &quot;The US just announced that it will launch its first Starship in a month. At the same time, we must also send people to the moon and establish a lunar base within 6 months.&quot; Huh. Lyn Shan was stunned for a moment, then instantly realized what was going on. The US wants to start a space race, huh? He wasn&#x27;t worried about it at all.</p>
<p>In just 6 months, the great SEA Kingdom may indeed be building a lunar base instead of making empty promises. As for the USS Starship test flight, that&#x27;s a joke. Calling that thing a starship is an insult to those two words. It&#x27;s just a big lump of iron. A real Starship is an interstellar warship.</p>
<p>A warship capable of interstellar travel. Minister Chin&#x27;s eyes lit up when he saw Lin Chin&#x27;s reaction. Chief Engineer Lynn, do you have a solution? Chapter 78, a calculated scheme, just a clown. Lie Jian Guo stood to the side. She also looked at Lyn Shan with great curiosity.</p>
<p>He wanted to know too, how exactly will Lynchin respond to the US&#x27;s space race? Lynch leaned back in his chair, looking completely calm and collected. Does the US want to start a space race? We can play with them, but we have to follow our rules. Li Jang Wos eyes lit up. You mean? Lynchan raised his eyes, his gaze slightly narrowed. After the successful maiden flight of Bidey, we will have the final say in space.</p>
<p>So what if their starships maiden flight is successful? Whether we can fly to the moon or not is up to us. After a pause, Lynchin continued, &quot;Moreover, we will also establish a base on the moon. After all, there are so many unclaimed resources on the moon. We certainly can&#x27;t let them go to waste.&quot; This was all part of his plan. After the bite aerospace fighter jet entered mass production, this will lead to the development of a space transport aircraft.</p>
<p>A vehicle specifically designed for transporting passengers between Earth and the moon. The technological transfer of the mighty aerospace fighter jet is about to be completed. Next, Lynchin plans to choose unmanned planetary base technology. This would allow us to mine resources on the moon. This is in preparation for building a near-earth space city.</p>
<p>Earth&#x27;s resources are simply insufficient for space exploration. Everything needs to be prepared in advance. Most importantly, the resources on the moon are all unclaimed. They can mine however they want. There&#x27;s no need to pay attention to the ecological environment.</p>
<p>Minister Chun was completely dumbfounded after hearing this. Chief Engineer Len, are you sure we can really build a lunar base? It&#x27;s not that he doesn&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s too sci-fi. The Great Sa Kingdom originally had a plan. The goal is to achieve a manned lunar landing by 2035, but it was just a moon landing.</p>
<p>Establishing a base on the moon and mining lunar resources are two completely different things. Lynshan now says that a lunar base can be established in 6 months. Could he not be shocked? Lie Jian Guo was also pleasantly surprised. Shaolin, you have a plan. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded emphatically. Minister Chun was stunned for two seconds, then overjoyed, he slapped his thighs hard with both hands, making a crisp cracking sound. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. Chief Engineer Lynn, you&#x27;ve really surprised us.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t the US interested in a space race? Well surpass them then, haha. Minister Chin became more and more excited as he spoke, and his voice rose several decibels. He knew Lynch and would say it. There must already be a corresponding solution. He didn&#x27;t need to delve into the specifics.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not something he could know. If we can resolve the issue with the US, that&#x27;s a good thing. Li Jang Wos eyes were full of excitement. Kobayashi, when will your plan begin? Lynchin looked at the two excited people and explained, &quot;It&#x27;s too early now. Let&#x27;s wait until the seventh generation fighter jet makes its maiden flight successfully before we talk about it.&quot; Okay.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo didn&#x27;t ask any further questions. Then, Minister Chin chatted for a few more minutes. Then, he left in a hurry. That afternoon, the military headquarters of the great Sia Kingdom issued an announcement. My country&#x27;s seventh generation fighter jet, the bite space fighter, will make its maiden flight on Lunar New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1 month from now.</p>
<p>The lunar base plan will be launched simultaneously with construction expected to begin within 6 months. The announcement was released. The world instantly erupted in excitement. The comments from netzens in the great Sea Kingdom were completely excited. Holy crap.</p>
<p>Am I seeing things? Seventh generation fighters are out already. What have they done to me? Are you sure we&#x27;re still on Earth? Awesome. They&#x27;ve skipped the sixth generation fighter jets. White Emperor Space Fighter. Does that name mean it can fight in space? The US only wants to send people to the moon, but our Great Sea Kingdom will just build a base, huh? The people of the entire Great Sea Kingdom cheered with joy.</p>
<p>All major social media platforms are filled with celebratory posts. Even veterans who are usually quiet have come out to leave comments. I have no regrets about being born into the great Sia dynasty. I will still be a citizen of Great Sea in my next life. Everyone is looking forward to the maiden flight of the seventh generation fighter jet in a month.</p>
<p>They all believe that it was the best spring festival gift the country could give them. The international community was in an uproar. American nizens were the first to jump out and question it. It&#x27;s fake. It must be fake.</p>
<p>Where did the great SEA Kingdom get the technology to develop space planes and a lunar base? They&#x27;re deliberately trying to distract us. They&#x27;re afraid our starships maiden flight will steal the spotlight. Japanese nizens echoed this sentiment. Baka, the Great Sea Kingdom is just bragging. The US&#x27;s starships are the real cuttingedge technology.</p>
<p>South Korean nizens don&#x27;t believe it either. Damn it. The Great Sea Kingdom is bragging again. It now seems that the great SIA kingdom is even more arrogant than we are. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re just arrogant and ignorant. Almost all netizens in the US-led coalition countries don&#x27;t believe it. Fifth generation fighter jets have only just become widespread. The sixth generation fighter jet was only recently made its maiden flight by the United States. The great SEA Kingdom claims to have developed a seventh generation fighter jet.</p>
<p>They absolutely cannot. If space technology were that easy to break through with so many scientists in the US-led coalition, they would have already ruled space. Therefore, they absolutely do not believe that the great SIA kingdom can develop a seventh generation fighter jet. However, nizens from neutral countries are taking a wait and see approach. It was outrageous that the great SEA kingdom shot down a sixth generation fighter jet before.</p>
<p>Maybe they really do have space planes. We&#x27;ll know in a month. Then we&#x27;ll see. White House. The president&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>OTEP is reviewing operational plans for the desert region. Suddenly, NASA administrator Trudeau walked in and said anxiously, &quot;Your Excellency, President, the Great Sa Kingdom has issued a proclamation.&quot; Upon hearing this, ATP was filled with disdain. He It seems that the Great Sa Kingdom really has no other choice. Trying to disrupt our plans with such a pointless method. Space fighters, lunar bases, it&#x27;s all a lie.</p>
<p>They just want to steal the spotlight from our starships maiden flight. NASA administrator Trudeau looked somewhat worried. Mr. President, what if they are real? Should we postpone the starships maiden flight? Postpone? Oep sneered. Why the postponement? Our starships are the most advanced on Earth.</p>
<p>The so-called space fighter jets of the great Sea Kingdom are a joke. Durret wanted to say something, but swallowed his words back. Then he said goodbye and left, but he had a bad feeling about it all along. The seventh generation fighter jet from the great Sea Kingdom might actually be real. Even the idea of establishing a lunar base is real.</p>
<p>Only their American man lunar landing is a pretense. They currently lack the technology for manned lunar landings. Unfortunately, he didn&#x27;t dare to say it. Otherwise, his time as bureau chief would be over. The president&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>Optin summoned the secretary of war, Peter. Pass on my orders. Sixth fleet. Full speed ahead to the desert region. No need to wait for our allies.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s take action now. I will show the great Sia Kingdom who the true overlord of Earth is. Pete paused for a moment, his brow furrowing slightly. Mr. President, shouldn&#x27;t we act now? Isn&#x27;t that too hasty? Rushing.</p>
<p>Otep&#x27;s eyes flashed fiercely. Does the great Sia Kingdom want to play games with us? Then let them see the mighty military strength of the American Empire. Well let the starship take its maiden flight after we&#x27;ve dealt with those countries in the desert region. At that time, the whole world will admire us. The lies of the great Sia kingdom will naturally fall apart on their own.</p>
<p>Remember, get the squid kingdom to cooperate with us. Chapter 79. Conflict erupts in the desert. Desert region. Squid country.</p>
<p>The prime minister&#x27;s office. Prime Minister Netanyahu just hung up the phone with Pete. His eyes were filled with excitement. Is the US going to take action in the desert regions? Isn&#x27;t this just giving our squid nation an opportunity to expand? Thinking of this, he immediately became very anxious about the highle meeting of the squid country. Half an hour later in the conference room, Netanyahu stated the US&#x27;s demands.</p>
<p>Tell us your opinions. Defense Minister Khaled immediately exclaimed excitedly. Prime Minister, this is a great opportunity. We must seize it. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>We must seize this opportunity. At that time, we can stage a conflict ourselves and start a war. As long as the US can hold back those countries in the desert region, we will definitely be able to take over the Bath region quickly. All high-ranking officials agreed to go to war, they have long wanted to expand outwards. It&#x27;s just that I haven&#x27;t been able to find the opportunity.</p>
<p>Now the US has come knocking on our door. They certainly won&#x27;t let this opportunity slip by. Very good. Nita nodded. Once the US carrier fleet arrives, we&#x27;ll create a trigger for war.</p>
<p>He stood up and walked to the map, pointing a finger at the border of the Stan region. Starting tomorrow, troops will begin moving towards the border of the Stan region. Khalid was stunned. Won&#x27;t this alert the enemy? What about the compromise organizations in the desert region? Ignore them. Nidita&#x27;s eyes flashed fiercely.</p>
<p>If they dare to make a move, wipe them out. No one can stop us from taking over the Stan region. The group exchanged glances, and no one objected further. They knew that the Squid Nation had long wanted to annex the Stan region. This time, they&#x27;re just using the US as a front to fulfill their own ambitions.</p>
<p>Nidato looked at the silent crowd and gave the order directly. Notify the troops to begin mobilization immediately. Well begin moving to the border tomorrow. Two days later, at a border post in the Stan region, Century Akmed lowered his binoculars, cold sweat beating on his forehead because he saw the army of the Squid Kingdom constantly gathering at the border in the distance. Captain, the Squid Kingdom&#x27;s army is growing stronger.</p>
<p>Ahmed&#x27;s voice trembled. You do you think they might attack? Captain Kareem dusted himself off, his face grim. I think so. I have already reported the news. Headquarters should take counter measures.</p>
<p>If the squid country dares to invade, well fight them to the death. Even if we die, we will defend our homeland. Akmed nodded, his eyes filled with determination. As time passed, little by little, the atmosphere at the border with Stan is becoming increasingly tense. The atmosphere in other countries in the desert region has also become tense.</p>
<p>They began to worry that the squid kingdom was up to something. The Sartra royal family. King Salman sat on his magnificent throne, his brow furrowed. He was clutching an urgent intelligence report tightly in his hand. This intelligence report concerns the large-scale troop buildup by the Squid Nation on the border of the Stan region.</p>
<p>What is the Squid country trying to do? Do they really want to start a war? King Salman&#x27;s voice carried a hint of worry. Prince Abdullah standing to the side looked serious. Father, the Squid Kingdom has always harbored ambitions of expansion. But we don&#x27;t need to worry this time. We have the laser cannons of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. King Salman nodded, his eyes full of confidence. With the great Sia Kingdoms laser cannons, we no longer need to worry about the US and the squid. By the way, have someone secretly send two laser cannons to Stan. I don&#x27;t want to see the squid kingdoms conspiracy succeed.</p>
<p>Yes, father. Several other countries shared Sarter&#x27;s ideas. Almost all countries in desert regions. Nobody wants to see Squid Country have an easy time. Moreover, they all purchased the new laser cannons from the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>no longer need to worry about air strikes from the US and the UAE. As for the ground troops, as long as the US dares to personally conduct amphibious operations, they have ways to make the American army perish in the desert. Without air superiority, the strength of the American military is just SOS. 2 days later, the US&#x27;s sixth carrier strike group has arrived off the coast of the Persian Gulf. On the aircraft carrier deck, the fighter jets were lined up neatly.</p>
<p>The sailors on deck hurried along, creating a bustling scene inside the command center. Fleet commander MacArthur. They are currently in encrypted communication with the Pentagon. Report: The sixth carrier strike group has arrived at its designated position and is ready to carry out combat missions at any time. The order came from the other end of the phone.</p>
<p>Proceed according to the original plan. Wait until the squid country creates conflict. Then we&#x27;ll launch an air strike. Okay, I understand. After MacArthur hung up the phone, &quot;Desert regions, you want to align yourselves with the great Sea Kingdom, then we must be prepared to pay a heavy price.&quot; He then ordered the fleet to rest and prepare for battle at any time.</p>
<p>At the same time, after learning of the arrival of the US aircraft carrier battle group, the Squid Nation, Netanyahu was overjoyed and immediately dialed the phone number, &quot;Start creating conflict.&quot; An excited voice came from the other end of the phone. Received action immediately. on the other side, the Squid Kingdom and the Stan Kingdom. At that moment, dozens of people from the Squid Kingdom were having a bonfire party. They sang and danced.</p>
<p>A scene of joy and peace, but nobody knows. Behind this seemingly ordinary gathering, a huge conspiracy is brewing. Sudden bang, a sharp gunshot pierced the night sky. A squid-like civilian was found lying in a pool of blood. The cheerful atmosphere instantly froze.</p>
<p>Everyone turned in terror to look in the direction from which the gunshots came. It&#x27;s the country of Stan. They&#x27;re shooting and killing people run. But they weren&#x27;t finished speaking. A group of armed men rushed out from the border of Stan.</p>
<p>They fired wildly at the squid. Before long, dozens of squid laid dead in pools of blood. The masked militants exchanged glances. They retreated frantically towards the sea. Not long after, the squid kingdom arrived.</p>
<p>Found a squid that wasn&#x27;t quite dead. The border guards anxiously asked, &quot;What happened? Who did it? There&#x27;s also someone recording a video nearby.&quot; The squid-like civilian coughed up blood and answered haltingly, &quot;It&#x27;s Stan country.&quot; Before he could finish speaking, his neck lalled to the side and he died with his eyes wide open. &quot;Damn it! Stan has made its move. Report to headquarters immediately.&quot; The border guards immediately sent the recorded video back. Soon, Nidita received the news.</p>
<p>A barely perceptible smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. Then he pretended to be griefstricken. As everyone has seen, it was the Stan Kingdom that launched the attack on our squid kingdom. The country of Stan must pay the price. Contact Stan immediately and demand that they hand over the murderer within half an hour.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we will personally find the murderer and take revenge. Chapter 80. Stan Kingdom. Great Sia is our last hope. Stan National Defense Command.</p>
<p>Those bastards, they orchestrated this whole thing themselves, and they still dare to turn around and accuse me. You want us to hand over the murderer? Dream on. The Minister of Defense was furious upon seeing the announcement from the Squid Nation. He considered that the Squid Congress would launch a direct attack, but he never expected the Squid Kingdom to be so shameless, using the lives of their own people to create conflict. It&#x27;s absolutely outrageous.</p>
<p>They are even more depraved than those terrorists. Chief of Staff, what do we do now? If we don&#x27;t compromise, we simply won&#x27;t be able to intercept the Squid Nation&#x27;s air strikes. Even ground troops can&#x27;t stop us. Moreover, the US carrier strike group has already arrived in the Persian Gulf, and it will definitely cooperate with the US in taking action. Are we really doomed? Fear spread like a tide.</p>
<p>Their weapons and equipment were simply too outdated. It&#x27;s completely incomparable to the squid country. Upon hearing this, the Minister of National Defense was filled with trepidation. He didn&#x27;t know what to do either. If we don&#x27;t compromise, the Squid Nation would then use this as an excuse to invade their Stan nation.</p>
<p>But if we compromise, wouldn&#x27;t that be admitting that Stan is a terrorist state? This is absolutely unacceptable. Sudden he thought of the two sets of laser air defense systems from the great Sia Kingdom that the Kingdom of Sartra had sent. No, we still have hope. Quickly activate the two great Sia Kingdom laser air defense systems that Sate sent. Perhaps it will bring us victory.</p>
<p>The other officers were taken aback for a moment, then became excited. Chief of staff, is this the laser cannon that the great Sea Kingdom used to shoot down the American war plane? Yes. The Minister of Defense nodded emphatically, but the range is only 150 km. Is it really 150 km? Perhaps it really can help us. If a sixth generation fighter jet can shoot down the US, it should have difficulty intercepting air strikes from the US.</p>
<p>All the officers were filled with renewed hope. They had also heard of the laser cannons of the great sea kingdom. The battle record is verifiable, even destroy the sixth generation fighter jets of the United States. Moreover, this is due to the country&#x27;s fourth generation and fifth generation fighter jets even if we can&#x27;t shoot down the fighter jets. Missiles and rockets that can defend against their air attacks are also acceptable.</p>
<p>Soon, the two laser air defense systems provided by the kingdom of SAT were activated. The atmosphere in the command center eased slightly, but everyone still had a weight on their shoulders. At the same time, other countries and desert regions. Sartra state air defense command center. King Salman stood in front of the large screen, his eyes sharp.</p>
<p>Activate all air defense systems. Closely monitor the movements of the US carrier strike group. If they make any unusual moves, open fire immediately to intercept them. Yes. The technician typed rapidly on the keyboard.</p>
<p>on the screen. A dense array of radar signals lit up. Salman stared at the screen, a confident smile playing on his lips. Eagle Squid Country, let me show you the power of the Great Sa Empires laser cannon. Prince Abdullah standing beside him added.</p>
<p>Father, we have notified other countries that their air defense systems have also been activated. Very good. Salman nodded. Let them know that we desert nations are not to be trifled with. He had full confidence in the laser air defense system of the great SIA kingdom.</p>
<p>Presidential palace, Iraq. The president looked at the urgent intelligence report with a grave expression. Damn it. Does the US want to bomb us again? We will absolutely not let them have their way this time. Order all air defense missile sites to enter level one alert.</p>
<p>Also, activate the laser cannon air defense system that the great SA kingdom sold us. The president&#x27;s voice was full of authority. He absolutely will not allow the tragedy of that year to repeat itself. The US air strikes back then severely damaged Iraq in just 7 days. More than a million troops were destroyed.</p>
<p>Thousands of tanks and hundreds of war plananes were bombed before they even took off. Now Raj has finally recovered. Is the US trying to repeat its old tricks? Dream. This time they have the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser anti-aircraft guns. If the US really comes, they&#x27;re doomed.</p>
<p>Half an hour. Fleeting. Squid Kingdom military headquarters. Nidato looked at his watch with a fierce expression. Time is up.</p>
<p>Has there been a reply from Stan? Defense Minister Khaled standing nearby shook his head. No. They completely ignored our warnings. Very good. Nidita sneered inwardly pleased with himself.</p>
<p>This is the result he wanted. He had accurately predicted that Stan would not compromise. That&#x27;s why they committed this heinous massacre. Give the order. Begin the air raid.</p>
<p>target Stan&#x27;s border post. After destroying the border forces of Stan, the army immediately launched a full-scale offensive. Yes. Khaled immediately relayed the order. Soon, Squid Country Air Force Base 10F 16 fighter jets took off directly.</p>
<p>They carried missiles and flew towards the border of Stan, the Persian Gulf, the US&#x27;s sixth carrier strike group. Inside the command center, MacArthur looked at the communicator, a sinister smile creeping onto his lips. The Squid Nation has begun air strikes. Are we ready with our reasons? The staff officer beside him immediately replied. Ready? Well say that Iraq is possessing weapons of mass destruction and that a military strike is necessary.</p>
<p>Very good, MacArthur nodded. Report to the Pentagon immediately and request approval to launch an air strike on Lake. Also notify the fighter jets on deck to prepare for takeoff. Yes. Soon the Pentagon&#x27;s order came in.</p>
<p>Air strikes approved. MacArthur picked up the communicator and shouted, &quot;All aircraft, take off. Target Lake Military Base, receive.&quot; The roar of fighter jets on the deck was deafening. One after another, Hornet carrier-based aircraft took off and flew towards the Republic of Lake Stan. Border air defense positions.</p>
<p>The soldiers stared at the radar interface of the laser cannon, their hearts filled with trepidation. Captain, are these two laser air defense systems really effective? A soldier was filled with worry because the weapons and equipment are too outdated. They have long been oppressed by the Squid Country. They hate the Squid Country to the core, yet are also filled with fear. This time, the Squid Kingdom has once again amassed a massive army on its border.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s obvious they&#x27;re planning a large-scale invasion. Captain Kareem took a deep breath. Whether it works or not, we&#x27;ll only know by trying. The great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser air defense system can even shoot down the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jets, so we have no reason not to believe it. But, &quot;Captain, we&#x27;ve never used it in actual combat before.&quot; The soldier was still somewhat uneasy, his voice trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Just then, a soldier on the other side shouted excitedly, &quot;Captain, the radar has locked onto the Squid Nation&#x27;s fighter jet. We will enter our airspace in 5 minutes.&quot; All right, Captain Kareem shouted excitedly. Everyone, heed my command. Open fire immediately if any US military aircraft enter our airspace. Receive.</p>
<p>On the other side, in the air, 10 Squid Nation fighter jets flew at high speed in formation. The missiles under the wings gleamed coldly in the sunlight. Inside the cabin, the pilots looked relaxed. There was absolutely no sign of war tension. We&#x27;re about to enter the kingdom of Stan.</p>
<p>Lower your altitude a bit later and bomb them. Let them experience the greatness of our squid kingdom. Haha. The captain was laughing heartily in the internal channel. It was as if the nation of Stan was nothing more than an ant that could be trampled on at will in their eyes.</p>
<p>Time passed second by second. The border of Stan. Captain Kareem was so nervous that his palms were sweating. His eyes were fixed on the radar screen. The Squid Nation warplanes entered their airspace.</p>
<p>Kareem yelled, &quot;Fire! Chapter 81. Laser cannon shoots down the squid fighter. Fire. Kareem&#x27;s roar had barely faded. Air defense positions on the border of the country of Stan.</p>
<p>Two dark blue laser beams suddenly shot out. Like two sharp blades cleaving through the air with a piercing buzz. It shot straight into the sky. In the air, Squid Country F-16 formation. The captain was staring at the instrument panel, a cold smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>30 seconds left. Prepare to drop the bomb. Let the trash of Stan taste the power of aerial bombs. Inside the cabin, the other pilots echoed their agreement. Don&#x27;t worry, well blow their outposts to smithetheriness.</p>
<p>Huh. I&#x27;ll get to collect military merits again when I get back. Nobody noticed. Below, two beams of blue light were approaching at a speed imperceptible to the naked eye. The captain suddenly sensed danger and instinctively looked up.</p>
<p>Two beams of dark blue light appeared right in front of them. Not good. He was about to pull the lever. Boom. The first laser beam hit his fighter jet engine precisely.</p>
<p>The high temperature instantly engulfed the fuselof. The cockpit glass shattered instantly. Flames shot in through the crack. The captain didn&#x27;t even have time to scream. The whole person was vaporized by the high temperature.</p>
<p>The fighter jets were like kites with broken strings. The fuselage broke apart instantly. It crashed to the ground, billowing black smoke. Bang! Another loud bang. The fuel tank was ignited.</p>
<p>The entire fighter jet exploded into a fireball. The fragments scattered like raindrops. The pilot next to him was terrified. What is that? Is it a missile? His voice was still trembling. The second laser beam has already struck.</p>
<p>Boom. His fighter jet was hit directly in the cockpit. The entire cockpit was instantly melted. The pilot was vaporized by the intense heat. The aircraft lost its balance and began to spin wildly.</p>
<p>It plunged head first into the ground. Bang! The fighter jet crashed in the desert. Boom! A terrifying explosion sent up clouds of dust. The remaining 8F16 pilots completely dumbfounded. One second they were celebrating.</p>
<p>The next second they witnessed two fighter jets being instantly destroyed. No one could tell where the attack came from. All I know is that those two blue lights are more terrifying than death itself. It&#x27;s a laser cannon. It must be a laser cannon from the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Someone shouted. All the pilots instantly regained consciousness. Fear overwhelmed them like a tidal wave. Run, get out of here immediately. The eight fighter jets were instantly thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Some even forgot to form a formation. They were only concerned with changing direction and frantically fleeing towards the squid country. The engine roared to its maximum. It&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s providing accompaniment to its own fears. Inside the cockpit, the pilots were deafly pale.</p>
<p>He gripped the control stick tightly with both hands. Sweat soaked through the flight suit. No one dared to turn back. They were terrified that the terrifying blue light would catch up with them again. Squid Kingdom military headquarters.</p>
<p>Nidato was sitting on the sofa holding a cup of coffee, waiting for good news from the front lines. Collet, do you think Stango will kneel down and beg for mercy this time? He smiled and looked at the Minister of Defense. Collet was about to speak. Report. A staff officer stumbled in.</p>
<p>His face was as pale as paper. Prime Minister, your excellency, the Prime Minister. Something&#x27;s wrong. Our F-16 formation. Something&#x27;s happened.</p>
<p>Nidita s coffee cup clattered to the ground. Coffee was spilled all over the floor. What did you say? He suddenly stood up, his eyes wide open like saucers. Say it again. The staff officer swallowed hard, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Our two F-16s were shot down by weapons from the United States. The remaining eight are making a hasty return flight. Shoot down. Nita grabbed the staff officer by the collar. How could Stan possibly be capable of shooting down our fighter jets? Don&#x27;t they only have outdated handmade rockets? Collet panicked.</p>
<p>Could the intelligence be incorrect? Where did Stan get such advanced weapons? The staff officer shook his head vigorously. It&#x27;s true, the pilot said on the channel. It&#x27;s a laser cannon from the great Sia Kingdom. The Great Sea Kingdom. Laser cannons.</p>
<p>Nida Yahua shuddered. With a sudden release, the staff officer fell directly to the ground. He recalled the news of the US sixth generation fighter jet being shot down. Could it be that the kingdom of Stan now possesses the laser cannons of the kingdom of Sia? Fear instantly flooded my mind. Impossible.</p>
<p>This is impossible. Why does Stan have laser cannons from the great Sea Kingdom? How could they possibly afford it? Why would the Great Sea Kingdom export such advanced weapons? Why is that? He muttered to himself and staggered back two steps. He slumped onto the sofa. His former arrogance and confidence have vanished. All that remained was panic and disbelief.</p>
<p>He never dreamed of this. Such a big change could happen. A new type of laser cannon from the Great Sea Kingdom has appeared in the desert region. This news is a disaster for the Squid Nation. Khaled was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>If the Stan Kingdom really does possess the laser cannons of the Great Sa Kingdom, then their next attack, wouldn&#x27;t that make us a laughingtock? Air defense positions on the border of the country of Stan. The soldiers watched the fireball explode in the sky. I was completely stunned. A few seconds later, the cheers were deafening. We won.</p>
<p>We won. The great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannons are amazing. They blew up their fighter jets. Huh? You scum from the squid kingdom. You finally met your match.</p>
<p>The soldiers hugged each other in excitement. Some even shed tears. The squid country for a long time. At this moment, it completely erupted. Kareem looked at the scene before him.</p>
<p>The clenched fists slowly loosened. My palms were sweaty. He took a deep breath. An excited smile appeared on his face. The laser cannons of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>They certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint us. He took out the satellite phone, his voice trembling. Report to the chief of staff. We have successfully shot down two F16 fighter jets from the squid country. The remaining enemy aircraft are fleeing.</p>
<p>State defense command of Stan. The chief of staff was staring at the screen, his palms sweating. Sudden Kareem&#x27;s excited voice came through the satellite phone. He suddenly stood up. What did you say? Say it again.</p>
<p>It was confirmed that two Squid Nation fighter jets had been shot down. The chief of staff slammed his fist on the table in excitement. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. The laser cannons of the Great Sa Kingdom are indeed powerful.</p>
<p>The officers nearby were also in an uproar. They really shot it down. We no longer have to fear air raids from the Squid Kingdom. Let&#x27;s see if they dare to provoke us again. The oppressive atmosphere in the command center instantly dissipated.</p>
<p>Instead, there was excitement and exhilaration. Everyone was gathered around the screen, looking at the fireball that had not yet dissipated. His eyes were full of hope. Within the country of Stan, the news spread quickly. People flooded the streets.</p>
<p>They waved the national flag and cheered with joy. We won. We shot down the Squid Nations war plane. Thank you, Great Sia Kingdom. Thank you, Kingdom of Sad, for providing the laser cannon.</p>
<p>Live on stand. The streets were filled with cheering crowds. The children waved small national flags and shouted along with the adults. The fear that has long been shrouded in the shadow of war. At that moment, all the smoke and dust vanished.</p>
<p>Chapter 82. Desert Tycoon places additional orders worth hundreds of billions. Desert region. Sutter Air Defense Command Center. King Salman looked at the battle report on the screen.</p>
<p>A smile appeared on his lips. Great job, Stan. The laser cannons of the great Sea Kingdom have certainly not disappointed us. This record, this is the first time in history that such a desert region has ever experienced this. The US that have never been shot down before.</p>
<p>This is the first time. Therefore, it is clear that the great Sia Kingdom made a worthwhile purchase of this anti-aircraft laser cannon. Even if they spend more money, they can buy peace of mind. Prince Abdullah also said excitedly. Father, now the Squid Kingdom should behave itself.</p>
<p>Salman shook his head, his eyes sharp. Uncertain. The Squid Kingdom is ambitious and won&#x27;t give up so easily. However, they certainly won&#x27;t dare to make a move now. He picked up the walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>Pass the order. All air defense systems must remain on alert. Be prepared to respond to any emergencies. Yes. Then Salman gave the prince further instructions.</p>
<p>immediately purchase another 100 sets from the great Sia Kingdom. I want to build our Sartra air defenses into an impregnable fortress. Prince Abdullah excitedly agreed. Okay, I&#x27;ll go contact the Great Sia Kingdom right away. One set costs 1 billion, so 100 sets would cost 100 billion.</p>
<p>Use 100 billion to buy Sartra security. Salman thought it was well worth it. Nothing is more important than safety. The Presidential Palace of Iraq. President Sam looked at the urgent battle report.</p>
<p>A relieved smile appeared on his face. Very good. We now have the laser cannons from the Great Sea Kingdom. We no longer have to fear air raids from the US and the UAE. Previously, he thought that the laser cannon air defense system of the Great Sa Kingdom was a bit too expensive.</p>
<p>I just noticed that other countries in the desert region are buying it. They also followed suit and bought five sets. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so well. It was totally worth it. He gave the order to his secretary beside him.</p>
<p>Announced this news immediately. Let the people know that we have the ability to protect ourselves. The secretary nodded. Yes, Mr. President.</p>
<p>The people of Logic. Learning that the Stan Kingdom had used the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannon to shoot down the Squid Kingdom sane. They also joined in the revalry. We finally don&#x27;t have to worry anymore. The tragedy of being severely damaged by the US in 7 days back then.</p>
<p>It happened again. The Persian Gulf, the US&#x27;s sixth carrier strike group. Inside the command center, MacArthur was staring at the screen, waiting for news of an air strike on Iraq. It&#x27;ll be soon as long as the Squid Country&#x27;s air strikes succeed. My carrier-based aircraft are ready to take off.</p>
<p>MacArthur was confident about the raid, the counterterrorism operation. Back then, they were able to dismantle Logic&#x27;s military forces in just 7 days. Now, he wants to take it a step further. In 3 days, all of Lakes&#x27;s military forces were dismantled. This will once again demonstrate the power of the US to the world.</p>
<p>Sudden a staff officer rushed in flustered. General, something terrible has happened. Two F-16s from the Squid Nation were shot down by the Stan Nation. MacArthur&#x27;s coffee cup froze in midair. What did you say, Stan country? How could they possibly be capable of shooting down an F16? This is simply an international joke on him.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s just garbage air defense from the country of Stan. How could they possibly shoot down an F16 fighter jet? Even if the fighter jet is landed at an altitude of a few hundred meters. Even Stan doesn&#x27;t have this capability. He simply didn&#x27;t believe the news. The staff officer hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>According to intelligence, the Stan Kingdom is using the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s laser cannons. Great Sia Kingdom laser cannon. MacArthur suddenly stood up. His face instantly turned ugly. He recalled the incident where the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jet was shot down by the great Sia&#x27;s laser cannon.</p>
<p>If Stan also had this weapon, that would be true if an F16 fighter jet was shot down. However, the country of Stan was so poor that even getting enough to eat was a problem. Where would they get the funds to purchase laser anti-aircraft guns from the Great Sea Kingdom? Furthermore, when did the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s laser anti-aircraft gun go on sale? Why haven&#x27;t they sent any news at all? Damn it, even Stan has the laser anti-aircraft guns of the great Sia Kingdom. Will Neryak also have it? Thinking of this, MacArthur broke out in a cold sweat. Quick, immediately halt takeoff of the fighter jets.</p>
<p>Yes. The staff officer hurriedly ran off to relay the order. MacArthur stared at the screen. His eyes were sinister. The Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the Great Sa Kingdom again. What exactly are they trying to do? Why export such advanced weapons to desert regions? Is it trying to get involved in the desert region? No. This matter must be reported to headquarters. He took out a satellite phone. The call went through to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Hello, this is MacArthur. The situation has changed. We need to reassess the situation in the desert region. After a few seconds of silence on the other end of the phone, a hurried voice came through. Suspend the operation and wait for further instructions.</p>
<p>MacArthur hung up the phone, his face growing increasingly grim. He knew about this operation. It might not be that easy. Now, it remains to be seen what kind of countermeasure the US headquarters will ultimately come up with. On the other side, the US military, the Pentagon, an emergency meeting is being held.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pit, his face grim, began. You&#x27;ve heard about the news from the desert region, haven&#x27;t you? Everyone, please share your opinions. A general was the first to stand up. His expression serious. Minister, this move by the great SEA Kingdom is clearly changing the balance of military power in the desert region.</p>
<p>We must take measures to curb this trend. Otherwise, the US influence in the region will decline significantly. A civilian official frowned and thought for a moment before saying, &quot;But we can&#x27;t act rashly. Until we find out exactly how many laser cannons the Great Sa Kingdom has exported to which countries in the desert regions, we should not take any action. Otherwise, the Squid Kingdom will be our fate.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pit braced his hands on the conference table, his eyes sharp. Regardless of the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s intentions, the desert region is an important area of interest for us, and we must not allow other forces to easily get their hands on it. Notify the intelligence department to gather detailed information on arms transactions between the great Sia Kingdom and desert countries. At the same time, we will have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodge a formal protest with the Great Sia Kingdom to express our dissatisfaction with their behavior. Yes.</p>
<p>Everyone responded in unison and then got to work. Soon, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Chinese embassy in the United States. We demand an explanation from the Great Sia Kingdom. The Great Sia Kingdom s embassy in the United States. Ambassador Sier received a formal protest document from the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>His brows furrowed slightly. It seems the US&#x27;s attempt to stir up trouble in the desert has failed. Although he doesn&#x27;t know the specifics yet, but it will definitely affect the interests of the United States. Then the matter was reported to the headquarters of the Great Sea Kingdom. The news quickly reached the military headquarters of the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>The military headquarters held a meeting. Haha, our laser air defense weapons are performing exceptionally well in desert regions. The American fighter jet was shot down instantly. We have just received many orders from desert regions, exceeding 200 billion. The generals were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>This is yet another real world example of the great SIA kingdoms weapons in combat. Even with only a stripped down version of the laser cannon, it has achieved such results. That will happen after the bite aerospace fighter jets are mass-produced with the military strength of the great sea kingdom. Wouldn&#x27;t it be invincible on earth? All the generals were full of expectations for the bite aerospace fighter. Chapter 83.</p>
<p>The great sia kingdom. The enemy may go and so may I. Siakiuan in Li Jangos office. He looked at the message sent by the military. His face was wrinkled but his eyes were full of excitement.</p>
<p>200 billion. Orders from desert regions have increased by another 200 billion. I never expected that even a downgraded version of the laser cannon could easily shoot down an American fighter jet. Haha. Lie Jian Guo became happier and happier as he thought about it and he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>At that moment, the door was pushed open. Lynshin walked in holding the progress report of the white emperor fighter jet in his hand. Seeing Li Jang Wos appearance, he askedly, &quot;What&#x27;s making you so happy?&quot; Lie Jian Guoo handed over the message, his voice trembling with excitement. Look, orders from the desert have increased by 200 billion. In the US, they wanted to cause trouble in the desert, but they were scared off by our laser cannons and stopped their operations.</p>
<p>Lynchin glanced at the document, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. This is just the beginning. He placed the test report on the table. The laser cannons have secured the ground. Next up, it&#x27;s space.</p>
<p>The assembly of our bitey aerospace fighter is progressing very smoothly. We will definitely be able to make our maiden flight as planned. When the time comes, we must send a big gift to the US. Currently, almost all technical problems with the bitey aerospace fighter jet have been resolved. Only the last technology, the quantum annihilation bomb, which is an integral part of the bite aerospace fighter technology, is still undergoing final research and development.</p>
<p>It is expected to be completed in one week. Once the new aerial bomb is completed, it will significantly boost the combat capabilities of the bite aerospace fighter jet. Okay, I&#x27;m relieved to have you here. Seeing the confidence in Linshen&#x27;s eyes, Lie Jian Guo instantly felt relieved. Lynch never disappoints him.</p>
<p>Then the two continued to talk about the derivative products of the project after B was completed. Lynhun directly presented his idea, the Kuing Space Transport aircraft, Embassy of the Great Sia State in the United States. Ambassador CIA sat at the table with the US Foreign Ministry&#x27;s negotiation documents in front of him. He picked up a pen and wrote a line in the reply box, his stroke strong and vigorous. The normal arms trade between the great Sia Kingdom and other countries is a matter within its sovereign rights, and the US has no right to interfere.</p>
<p>After finishing writing, he pushed the document to his assistant. Send it back. Don&#x27;t be shy. The assistant nodded, turned, and quickly left. Ambassador Sia looked out the window, his eyes sharp.</p>
<p>The US wants a monopoly and wants to control others. No way. This was also why the headquarters of the great Sia Kingdom instructed him to reply to the US in this way. The Pentagon, the US military, Pete, holding the reply from the great Sia Kingdom was so angry that he threw the document on the ground. No right to interfere.</p>
<p>They actually said, &quot;We have no right to interfere.&quot; He pointed to the door and roared at the staff officer. Issue an announcement immediately. Condemn the great SA kingdom to the whole world. Say they are disrupting the regional balance. Let all the nations of the alliance stand up when have the Americans ever been treated like this.</p>
<p>The world must condemn the great Sia Kingdom. The staff officer dared not delay and turned to leave in a hurry. In the conference room, the other generals looked grim. The Great Sa Kingdom is deliberately slapping us in the face. They shot down a sixth generation fighter jet before and now they&#x27;re selling laser cannons.</p>
<p>They just want to challenge our hegemony. We have to put pressure on them. Otherwise, who will listen to us in the future? Pete was breathing heavily, his eyes filled with malice. Notify all allies to immediately issue a statement condemning the great Sia Kingdom. I refuse to believe that they can remain defiant despite pressure from so many countries.</p>
<p>Soon, the Eagle&#x27;s announcement spread around the world. The great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s export of advanced laser weapons is severely disrupting the military balance in desert regions and threatening global security. We demand an immediate halt to the trade. The announcement was just released. Japan, South Korea, India, the Philippines, and the European Union quickly followed suit.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Sakura issued a statement. The actions of the great SA kingdom are a provocation against the global order. We strongly condemn them. South Korea issued a statement. The US is right.</p>
<p>Great SEA must stop this dangerous behavior. India also chimed in. We support the US. Great SEA should abide by the rules of the international arms trade. In a short time, the condemnation of the Great Sia Kingdom by the Eagle Alliance was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Just then, the announcement from the military headquarters of the Great Sea Kingdom suddenly appeared on all platforms. The red title is particularly eye-catching. If the US can sell weapons globally, why can&#x27;t China? If the enemy can go, so can I. The Great Sa Kingdom does not provoke trouble, but it is absolutely not afraid of trouble. Any attempt to smear or pressure the Great Sia Kingdom will be ineffective.</p>
<p>The announcement was short, but every word was powerful and resounding. It struck everyone&#x27;s hearts like a heavy hammer. Netzens in the Great Sia Kingdom were instantly in an uproar. Wow, the military&#x27;s response is so powerful. If the enemy can go, so can I.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a well said. If the US can sell weapons, why can&#x27;t we? Get out, you hypocrite. Why are Japan and South Korea so quiet now? Following the US lead, great SEA is awesome. From now on, offense and defense will be reversed. Veterans also left messages, their words filled with excitement.</p>
<p>We were bullied back then, but now we can finally stand tall. I have no regrets about being born into the great Sia dynasty. I will still be a citizen of the Great Sia dynasty in my next life. Cheers could be heard everywhere in the streets and alleys. Someone waved the national flag and shouted in the square, &quot;Long live the great sea.&quot; Even the children were waving little flags and shouting along with the adults.</p>
<p>The entire Great Sa Kingdom was as lively as if it were Chinese New Year. Netzens in the US China alliance were completely dumbfounded. American nizens stared at their screens, their fingers trembling.  How dare the great Sea Kingdom be so arrogant? Weren&#x27;t you afraid of us just a few months ago? What happened to you? American nizens seem unable to accept this cruel reality. In just a few months, as a result, the United States international standing plummeted.</p>
<p>Japanese nizens are deflated. Baka, the great Sia Kingdom is not afraid of our condemnation at all. I was hoping to get help from Daddy America, but it seems even daddy America is out of options now. South Korean nizens panicked. Holy crap.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdoms laser cannons are so powerful. Will we still dare to mess with them in the future? Nizens from neutral countries were thrilled. The Great Sea Kingdom has truly risen. From now on, Earth will no longer be ruled by the United States alone. If CO can go, so can I.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s such a cool line. White House. OTP trembled with rage as he looked at the announcement from the Great Sa Kingdom. Asshel, how dare the great Sia Kingdom treat us like this? He pointed at the phone and yelled at the secretary of state. Contact the countries in the desert regions immediately.</p>
<p>Make them suspend their trade with the great Sia kingdom. The Secretary of State looked grim. Mr. President, they might not listen to us. We must listen.</p>
<p>Otep&#x27;s eyes were bloodshot. Tell them that if they dare to continue buying, we will sanction them. The Secretary of State dared not refute him and turned to make a phone call. Otep slumped in his chair. His eyes glazed over.</p>
<p>If we can&#x27;t handle the desert regions, then let&#x27;s try space. He jumped up and grabbed the satellite phone. Connect me to NASA. Improve the development of starships immediately. And the lunar landing program must be brought forward.</p>
<p>I want the great SIA kingdom to know that we are still the hegemon in the space domain. The NASA administrators voice came through the phone tinged with hesitation. President, the starship isn&#x27;t ready yet. Rushing it would be very risky. Risk? Otep sneered.</p>
<p>Is there any risk more terrifying than that of the great SIA kingdom? Tell Musk the bonus is $1 billion a day early. Get it done right now. If you can&#x27;t do it right, you&#x27;re fired. After hanging up the phone, ATP stared out the window. His eyes were filled with resentment and madness.</p>
<p>He knew that the desert region was out of control. Now all the bets have to be placed on the space race, but he didn&#x27;t know. All of this is just wishful thinking on his part. Chapter 84. Starship in trouble.</p>
<p>Indians offer assistance. NASA headquarters conference room. The conference room was filled with the core scientists of the Starship project as well as Musk. Durret sat in the main seat, his face stern. The president just gave me the order.</p>
<p>The maiden flight of the Starship should be brought forward as soon as possible. A billion dollars in bonuses a day early. If this goes wrong, everyone&#x27;s fired. Musk was wearing a gray hoodie. His hair was messy and his fingers kept rubbing the coffee cup.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the word early, he looked up abruptly, his eyes filled with helplessness. Chief Trudeau, that&#x27;s impossible. The Starship ceiling valves haven&#x27;t been fully tested yet, and the inventory of key components is only enough for one test flight. If it&#x27;s done earlier, the risk will double,&quot; an elderly scientist wearing glasses pushed up his glasses and said in a deep voice, &quot;Chief, we haven&#x27;t even finished the most basic stress test. The valve had leaked three times during previous flight simulations.</p>
<p>Moving things forward now is gambling with lives. Another blonde scientist chimed in. Yes. Moreover, the precision requirements for titanium alloy parts are extremely high and our own factories simply cannot produce them all. We used to have everything processed in the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>But now, he hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. The conference room fell into a deathly silence. Everyone knows that given the current relationship between the US and China, it&#x27;s impossible for the US to import components from China. Durret stared at them, his expression growing increasingly grim. If the Great Sa Kingdom doesn&#x27;t work, well find someone else.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not the only ones capable of doing this on Earth. But his tone also suggested a lack of confidence. If other countries can process it, they wouldn&#x27;t have needed to import from the Great Sea Kingdom back then. Most importantly, the components are manufactured in the Great Sea Kingdom, which are of high quality and inexpensive. Moreover, they use only the finest materials and never cut corners.</p>
<p>Just then, a man wearing an orange shirt stood up. He is a scientist who immigrated from India and his name is Kira. Kira suggested with a smile, &quot;Director, how about we try getting India to help with the processing? From what I understand, India&#x27;s processing technology is also very advanced. My relatives back home also specialize in producing precision parts, and the prices are half the price of those in the great Sia Kingdom.&quot; The moment those words were spoken, the conference room erupted in chaos. An elderly scientist suddenly stood up glaring angrily and said, &quot;Kira, are you crazy? The processing technology of India? They can&#x27;t even make ordinary steel parts up to standard.</p>
<p>The bracket we had them make last time deformed before we even installed it.&quot; The blonde scientists scoffed. Using parts manufactured in India, our starship might as well declare a failure. Other scientists stepped forward to refute this. This shows just how bad India&#x27;s reputation is. Seeing this, Kira&#x27;s face instantly turned red and he forced himself to explain.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s different. This time it&#x27;s different. My cousin&#x27;s factory has introduced new equipment that specializes in making titanium alloys. I guarantee the accuracy will be perfect. Durret looked at the arguing crowd with a gloomy expression.</p>
<p>He turned to look at Musk and asked in a deep voice, &quot;Musk, say something.&quot; Musk sighed, leaned back in his chair, and looked tired. Currently, there is no better option. The Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s path is not viable. Other countries either lack the technology or the production capacity. Even if the risks are high, we can only give it a try.</p>
<p>India. His voice was soft. Yet, it sounded like a stone thrown into water. The old scientist wanted to argue but was interrupted by a look from Durit. It settled then.</p>
<p>Kira, contact your cousin&#x27;s factory and order a batch of ceiling valves immediately. There&#x27;s only one requirement. Delivery must be made within 5 days. Hero was so excited he almost jumped up and nodded quickly. Okay, I&#x27;ll make the call right now.</p>
<p>He took out his phone, stroed out of the meeting room, and muttered to himself. This time, well show you the true strength of India. Durret watched his retreating figure, then glanced at Musk, his brow furrowed, &quot;Muskavi, do you really think they can do it?&quot; Musk shook his head, picked up his coffee cup, took a sip, and said with a rice smile, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but now we have no choice but to gamble. I&#x27;m betting that India will be reliable this time.&quot; The scientists in the conference room all had their heads down and no one spoke. They all knew in their hearts that the odds of winning this bet were extremely slim.</p>
<p>The outskirts of Mumbai, India, in a dilapidated little workshop. The roar of the machines was deafening and the ground was littered with scrap metal and oil. The workshop owner was a bearded man named Sanjay. He held an order in his hand and said speechlessly, &quot;Titanium alloy ceiling valve and it has to meet NASA standards.&quot; Kira, that kid really knows how to brag. The worker next to Sanjay scratched his head and asked in a low voice, &quot;Boss, we don&#x27;t have any titanium alloy material.</p>
<p>What should we do?&quot; Sunj sneered and patted the worker on the shoulder. No titanium alloy? Can&#x27;t you just use aluminum alloy? If you paint it with titanium alloy color, who can tell? NASA people won&#x27;t take it apart to check. As long as it looks good on the surface, that&#x27;s fine. The worker was stunned. But what if something goes wrong? Sanjay glared at him, his tone fierce.</p>
<p>Go wrong? By the time they find out, our money will already be in our hands. At that point, who will care whether their starships explode? He picked up a paintbrush, dipped it in silver paint, and started brushing it onto the aluminum alloy valve. Sanjay hummed a little tune as he brushed. It&#x27;s so easy to make money off the US. You can get tens of thousands of dollars just by doing a little shoddy work.</p>
<p>Once this batch of goods is delivered, I&#x27;ll buy a new car and get married. The workers next to him looked at him with envy in their eyes. Little did they know, these aluminum alloy valves, painted silver, are about to be deployed on the US Starship. It is about to carry the dream of the United States to return to the moon and soar into space. US paid tens of millions of dollars for these components.</p>
<p>They only received tens of thousands of US dollars. 5 days later, NASA headquarters, Durit and Musk were standing in the warehouse looking at the valves that had just been delivered. Musk picked up a valve, weighted in his hand, and frowned. This weight is wrong. It&#x27;s much lighter than the one from the great Sia Kingdom before.</p>
<p>Durret smiled, and patted him on the shoulder. Lighter is better. It will reduce the weight of the starship. Since India&#x27;s technology has improved, you don&#x27;t need to worry. Musk remained silent, but a sense of unease rose within him.</p>
<p>He always felt that there was something wrong with these valves. But time was running out, and the starship&#x27;s maiden flight date had to be brought forward. He could only suppress his unease and turn to leave the warehouse. In 10 days, the Starship will be launched into space. He just didn&#x27;t know that.</p>
<p>This seemingly grand space journey was destined to be a tragedy from the very beginning. Chapter 85. the new national treasure weapon, quantum annihilation bomb, the great Sia Kingdom, Kyoto weapons testing ground. General Jeang stood on the observation platform in the distance. He looked at Lin Shan with great curiosity.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn, how powerful is this quantum annihilation bomb. Lyn Shan, dressed in a white lab coat, smiled mysteriously and said, &quot;General Jeang, I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&quot; Driven by curiosity, General Zang couldn&#x27;t help but press further. Chief Engineer Lynn, just tell me first. I Li Jang Guoo stood to the side, watching and wanting to laugh. Old Jang, let me introduce you.</p>
<p>Although this missile is only the size of a basketball, its power is comparable to that of a 100 ton nuclear bomb. What? So small? It has the power of a 100 ton nuclear bomb. That&#x27;s terrifying. General Ciangs eyes widened in disbelief. Lynchin nodded slightly and explained with a smile.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. This quantum annihilation bomb can also be miniaturaturized, even to the size of a fist. After detonation, it will only produce a localized energy shock wave, and there will be no radiation. General became instantly excited. That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>We now have another new type of strategic weapon. Li Jang Wo laughed and said, &quot;Yes, let&#x27;s see how powerful it is.&quot; First, Lynch checked the time. Let&#x27;s go to the observation room. The three entered the observation room. The huge display screen clearly showed the open space.</p>
<p>The quantum annihilation bomb has been placed in the designated location. All personnel were evacuated to a distance of 1 kilometer. Attention all units. The test countdown is 10 seconds. Instructions came over the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>General Jeang leaned forward, his eyes fixed on the screen. Lie Jian Guo clenched his fist. Lynchin&#x27;s expression was calm and full of confidence. He had already tested this bomb in the inheritant space. Its power is terrifying.</p>
<p>10 9 8 The countdown echoed in the observation room. General Jeang held his breath. 3 2 1 detonate. Moment. Boom.</p>
<p>A blinding white light flashed across the screen, brighter than the sun. Immediately afterwards, a terrifying quantum annihilation wave spread outwards. After the blinding white light disappeared, a giant crater 100 meters in diameter and 10 m deep has appeared directly on what was originally an open space. The pit walls were smooth with no mud or dust flying around. It was as if everything within the blast radius was instantly annihilated.</p>
<p>It left no trace whatsoever. The observation room was completely silent. General Ciangs mouth was agape, looking utterly dumbfounded. 3 seconds later, General Jeang suddenly stood up, swallowed hard, and his voice trembled. This This is the quantum annihilation bomb.</p>
<p>He pointed at the screen. The power of that shock wave just now felt even more terrifying than a mushroom bomb. Lie Jian Guo stared at the data panel, his eyes filled with shock. This is terrifying to annihilate everything directly. If the power were increased further, wouldn&#x27;t it be able to annihilate a city? I have never seen a bomb with such terrifying power.</p>
<p>It even surpasses the power of a mushroom bomb. The key is that it has no side effects. It only inflicts effective damage on the target. Lynch nodded. If you want it, you certainly can.</p>
<p>By increasing the size and power, annihilating a small city is still very easy. He didn&#x27;t say the second half of his sentence. If its power were increased to a certain level, it could easily annihilate a planet, but it&#x27;s beyond the current technological capabilities of Earth. Currently, quantum annihilation bombs are only in their initial stages. More advanced versions will be released later.</p>
<p>General Jeang strode to Lin Shen side full of anticipation. Chief Engineer Lynn, when will this quantum annihilation bomb be mass-produced? Our great Sea Kingdom needs such a national treasure. Lynching gave General Jeang a reassuring look. Technology and production process sanctions are already in place. All you need to do is find a military factory to modify the production line and you can start mass production.</p>
<p>Really? General exclaimed excitedly. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. When I get back, I&#x27;ll have the General Assembly logistics department arrange for the mass production integration. Lynn Shin nodded slightly.</p>
<p>As soon as possible, hopefully in time for the maiden flight of our white emperor space fighter. General patted his chest and assured him. Don&#x27;t worry, well definitely make it. Lynch nodded and said nothing more. His idea was simple.</p>
<p>To launch BY on the day of its maiden flight. The first flight was carried directly with the quantum annihilation bomb. If at that time any country jumps out and causes trouble, reward them with a big present for today. Next, the engineers repeatedly tested the air at the explosion center and all data showed normal readings. The results showed that no harmful substances remained.</p>
<p>The air quality was exactly the same as before the explosion. Thus, the quantum annihilation bomb test was successful. Lin Chun, Li Jang Guo, and others went directly back to the Xiaku Academy. General Jang then went to see Minister Chun. 10 days later, NASA launch center.</p>
<p>A massive Starship sized iron barrel stands on the launchpad. The pure steel metal casing gleamed coldly in the sunlight. On the Global Live broadcast, the host&#x27;s voice was filled with excitement. Ladies and gentlemen, everyone has seen our greatest invention, the Starship. This will be the first step for humanity to return to the moon.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will also be the first step for humans to land on Mars. Today, our Starship will carry three astronauts into space to conduct a series of tests before safely returning to Earth to lay a solid foundation for our future manned lunar landing. The global audience in the live stream went wild. Oh my god, the starship looks so awesome. If we can really send people to Mars, that would be a huge step forward for human civilization.</p>
<p>Muskavi is a beacon of light for humanity. I believe he will lead us out of Earth. The great Ma Shung is about to rewrite history. Ma Shung will definitely become the greatest person in the world. In the live stream, various comments scrolled rapidly.</p>
<p>They knew that the Starship spacecraft was developed by Musk&#x27;s company. He has a crazy cult of faith in Musk. They even revered him as the saint of horses, a beacon of light for humanity. NASA launch center. Optin was also present.</p>
<p>He gazed at the towering starship filled with excitement. Truit, are you confident about this maiden flight? Trudeau patted his chest and assured him. Mr. President, rest assured we will succeed. As he spoke, he looked at Musk beside him and said, &quot;Right, right, Musk.&quot; Musk nodded.</p>
<p>Yes, it will succeed. But he had a bad feeling about it. The thought of parts coming from India is unbearable. He was filled with apprehension. Let&#x27;s hope nothing unexpected happens.</p>
<p>Musk could only pray to the Statue of Liberty in his heart. OP and the others nodded in satisfaction upon hearing the answer. Very good. Let&#x27;s begin. Yes, Mr.</p>
<p>President, Trudeau replied. Then he ordered the Starship to begin the ignition countdown. Soon on the live TV broadcast, the countdown has begun. 10 9 8 3 2 1 Ignition. Chapter 86.</p>
<p>The Starship flew away. The words had barely left his mouth. The Starship&#x27;s bottom is powered by 38 Raptor engines that spew out orange red flames. A terrifying heatwave whipped up dust and sand from the ground. The giant barrel-like starship slowly departed from the launchpad.</p>
<p>The speed gradually increased and it climbed towards the sky. Sunlight shone on the pure steel casing, making it gleam dazzlingly. Inside the Starship astronaut cabin, the three astronauts stared intently at the instrument panel. Tom Ray, 58, with a full head of white hair, has served on multiple space station missions. Lucy, a 48-year-old woman, has traveled to the International Space Station twice.</p>
<p>Jack, 35, is a young astronaut on his first deep space mission. Tom Ray watched the starship slowly ascend. A smile involuntarily crept onto his face. We did it. We really took off.</p>
<p>Our starship&#x27;s maiden flight will definitely be a success this time. Jackie&#x27;s eyes gleamed with excitement. This is the most glorious moment of my life. Lucy, cheers to the glory of our American empire. The three of them exchanged a smile, their eyes filled with excitement.</p>
<p>They could almost see themselves swimming freely in space. As the starship continued to ascend. Ground observation station, Opton suddenly stood up. Wave your hands vigorously. It&#x27;s flying.</p>
<p>Our starship has taken off. Trudeau, his face flushed with excitement, exclaimed, &quot;President, we did it. This is a milestone for humanity.&quot; Musk&#x27;s tense body relaxed. He let out a long sigh of relief. Yet, a hint of unease still lingered in his eyes.</p>
<p>But this was quickly overshadowed by excitement. Thank goodness. Thankfully, there were no problems. The surrounding staff cheered. Some people even hugged each other.</p>
<p>The entire launch center was in an uproar. In the global live broadcast room, the comments section was flooded with messages. American nizens went completely crazy. Oh my god, this is the power of our American nation. Starships are so cool.</p>
<p>Ma Shang is awesome. Just wait. The moon will soon be ours. Not only the moon, but Mars will be ours, too. Even the entire space will become our backyard.</p>
<p>Right now, all Americans began to celebrate. They can&#x27;t even drink beer on the street normally. At this moment, everything is permitted. And some black guys, why are they celebrating the successful launch of the Starship? Go ahead and celebrate with a massive free shopping spree. At the same time, Japanese nizens also joined in the celebration.</p>
<p>Wow, our American daddy is amazing. The great SEA Kingdom, how can it catch up with my great American daddy? If the US succeeds, then we succeed. In little Baka&#x27;s opinion, as long as the US succeeds in that time, they can also benefit. On the other side, South Korean nizens were not to be outdone. Holy crap.</p>
<p>This is real technology. Great Sia Kingdom. Can you steal this advanced technology? Great technologies will always be in the hands of our developed countries. Indian nitizens were even more excited. The parts we provided were indeed reliable.</p>
<p>Without us, the US won&#x27;t make a difference. Haha. From now on, our India will be the world&#x27;s number one manufacturing power. Viewers from the great SIA kingdom watch the live stream. I didn&#x27;t really care anyway.</p>
<p>But when I saw the comments from nizens from India, I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. What the hell? The US dares to use parts manufactured in India? It&#x27;s a sure thing. This time, the US starships are definitely going to run into trouble. Huh? I thought the US was going to succeed this time, but it turns out they used parts manufactured in India. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not that they look down on India. India really has a history of such issues. They launched the rockets themselves. Many accidents have occurred because of the lack of progress in the processing. Even missile tests can scare neighboring countries into activating their air defense systems.</p>
<p>This shows just how poor they are at finishing. In response to the remarks of the great sea kingdom, the US-led coalition of netizens launched a fierce rebuttal. To put it bluntly, nizens from the great sea kingdom are being sarcastic towards them. Netzens from the Great Sea Kingdom remain silent, only smiling, waiting to see the shell. The starship continued to ascend.</p>
<p>The altimeter shows that the altitude has exceeded 3,000 m. Inside the cockpit, Tom Ray was preparing to report the situation to the ground. Sudden a piercing alarm sounded. The red warning light is flashing wildly. Warning, warning.</p>
<p>Helium leak. Helium leak. Warning. Energy system anomaly. Energy leak.</p>
<p>The cold electronic notification echoed in the cockpit. The smiles on the three faces vanished instantly. Tom&#x27;s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly checked the data. What&#x27;s going on? Why did a helium leak occur? Lucy&#x27;s hands flew across the control panel. Energy output is unstable.</p>
<p>We are losing momentum. Jack panicked and cried for help in a trembling voice. Ground. Ground. This is a starship.</p>
<p>We have experienced a helium and energy leak. Requesting emergency assistance. Ground launch center. The cheering atmosphere instantly froze. On the monitoring screen, various data of the Starship began to fluctuate abnormally.</p>
<p>Oh no, the Starship&#x27;s helium pressure is abnormal. The energy system has malfunctioned. The leak is happening very quickly. The technician&#x27;s shout made everyone&#x27;s hearts leap into their throats. Optin&#x27;s smile froze and his pupils contracted sharply.</p>
<p>How so? Didn&#x27;t you say everything was normal? Durret panicked and hurriedly grabbed the communicator. Starship, Starship, stay calm. Try to plug the leak. Musk&#x27;s heart skipped a beat. He suddenly realized something and his voice trembled.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s It&#x27;s a component from India. those valves. He had been worried that there might be something wrong with the parts from India and now it has indeed happened inside the Starship&#x27;s cockpit. Tom Ray tried his best to stop it. No, it won&#x27;t stop.</p>
<p>The leak is getting faster and faster. He has flown into space so many times. This is the first time something like this has happened. Previously, the most common problem was engine failure. There has never been a problem with the valves.</p>
<p>Lucy&#x27;s eyes reened. Energy output is only 30%. We&#x27;re going to lose control. She panicked completely. I originally thought this mission would go very smoothly.</p>
<p>Result. Jack cried and shouted into the communicator. Ground. We can&#x27;t control the Starship. Requesting instructions.</p>
<p>Requesting instructions. The Starship began to sway slightly and its rate of altitude increase slowed significantly. Ground observation station. Opton stared intently at the screen, his veins bulging. He originally thought that the launch of the Starship would be the most glorious moment of his term, but now it has become a nightmare.</p>
<p>Durret was sweating profusely and yelled at the technician, &quot;Quick, think of something. We can&#x27;t let the starship crash.&quot; The technicians were in a frantic rush, but there was nothing they could do. Data shows that the Starship&#x27;s helium and energy leaks are out of control. In the live stream, the cheers from American nizens vanished instantly. The style of the bullet comments suddenly changed.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on? What does the alarm mean? Helium leak, energy leak. Is something bad about to happen? Don&#x27;t scare me. The starship can&#x27;t be damaged. Nizens in Japan and South Korea are also panicking. How could this happen? Is there something wrong with the starship? It won&#x27;t crash, will it? That would be so embarrassing.</p>
<p>Chapter 87. The Starship exploded. A giant firework worth billions in the global live broadcast room. The screen was instantly flooded with comments from nizens in the great sea kingdom. Here it comes.</p>
<p>What did I tell you? The components from India are bound to have problems. Hilarious. The US probably bought Indian junk and put it on their star ships. Waiting for the explosion. India deserves the best teammate sabotage award for this.</p>
<p>Some people even took screenshots of the comments that Indian nizens had previously boasted about. The caption read, &quot;A major face slapping moment.&quot; and the comments section erupted in laughter. Siaki Yuan Li Jang Wos office. The big screen was showing a live broadcast of Starship. Lie Jian Guo paused, his hand holding the teacup still, and he was momentarily stunned.</p>
<p>Does the US want to make a technological breakthrough, or is it just trying to make a fool of itself? Lynchin leaned back in his chair, looking completely at ease. Huh? I thought the US had really made a breakthrough in the space field. That&#x27;s it. He originally thought that the US had really made a major breakthrough in the space field. I was originally thinking of waiting until it flew into near-earth space.</p>
<p>Used to test the performance of the enhanced laser cannon. As a result, he immediately pooped a huge lump. Follow this rhythm. He doesn&#x27;t even need to lift a finger. This giant iron barrel is bound to explode.</p>
<p>Shaolin, our white emperor space fighter, shouldn&#x27;t have this kind of problem, right? Li Jang Wo was also a little worried when he saw that the US starship had this problem. Don&#x27;t worry, By has a self-checking system. If any component is faulty, it will be detected. Lynch was full of confidence. Putting aside other things, the components of the entire Bite city.</p>
<p>All of them were processed by engineers from the Syaku Institute. The size and material of each component undergo rigorous testing. No flaws are allowed. While Lin Chun and the others were talking, in the live stream footage, the Starship is on the verge of collapse. Inside the Starship&#x27;s cockpit, Tom&#x27;s forehead veins bulged.</p>
<p>He is still doing his best to plug the leak no matter how hard we try. In the case of India using aluminum alloy instead of titanium alloy, it was of no use. In the end, the valve completely burst open. Until this point, Tom realized the problem. He roared angrily.</p>
<p>The valves are made of aluminum alloy. Muscovie, you&#x27;ve ruined us. He had just finished yelling. The starship was shaking more and more violently, and the numbers on the instrument panel were flashing red. The sky outside the window began to spin, and the orange red engine flames flickered on and off.</p>
<p>Sudden, a blinding white light exploded in the air. Boom! Boom! Boom! A huge explosion resounded throughout the entire airspace. The Starship exploded in midair. An orange red fireball burst open high in the sky like a deformed firework. Fragments scattered and sparks flew everywhere.</p>
<p>Some burned to ashes before they even hit the ground. The original Starship was instantly turned into a burning pile of scrap metal. Ground launch center. Optin stood frozen in place. His eyes were wide open like saucers, and he repeated, &quot;It&#x27;s blown up, my starship.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s blown up. He never dreamed of this. The first test flight of the starship will end in this way. Even if it flies out of Earth, it will disintegrate in space. They can also find excuses to cover it up, but it exploded right after takeoff.</p>
<p>It happened during a live broadcast. How can they possibly excuse themselves to the world? He abruptly raised his hand, pointing at Musk, his voice trembling. Musk. Didn&#x27;t you say it was fine? Musk felt worse than if he had swallowed a dead fly. He grabbed his hair with both hands and screamed in despair.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s India. It&#x27;s their valve. I told you there was a problem, but you insisted on going. Upon hearing this, Durret collapsed to the ground. Looking at the fireball on the screen, his face turned as white as paper.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s all over. Kira, an engineer from India. Seeing this scene, I was so frightened that I trembled all over. There was even yellow liquid between her legs, and she kept muttering, &quot;Impossible.</p>
<p>This is definitely not because of the valve. There must be something else going on.&quot; Optin turned to Kira and roared. Guards, arrest this swindler. Kira was terrified and begged for mercy frantically. &quot;Don&#x27;t arrest me.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t my fault. It&#x27;s those Indian swindlers. They have nothing to do with me.&quot; Kira cried out, his face covered in tears and snot. But the guards ignored him completely. They dragged him away for questioning.</p>
<p>In the global live broadcast room, American nizens are completely devastated. They felt like they had gone from heaven to hell. What was originally a celebration turned into wailing. No. My Starship, my dream of landing on the moon.</p>
<p>Why did this happen? Why did it explode? W Valves replaced with aluminum alloy. Has Musk gone mad? We spent so much money and now we&#x27;ve become a laughingstock all over the world. It&#x27;s outrageous. American nizens are fiercely condemning Musk. He went from being a beacon of humanity to a fraudster.</p>
<p>Japanese nizens immediately deflated. It&#x27;s over. America&#x27;s starships have been destroyed. How are we supposed to benefit from this? A South Korean nizen finally managed to utter, &quot;If I had known, I shouldn&#x27;t have mocked the great Sia Kingdom.&quot; Indian nizens simply disappeared, not daring to show their faces again. Netzens in the great Sea Kingdom went wild.</p>
<p>Great. Well done. These fireworks are even better than the ones on the spring festival gala. This move by India is practically making them an invisible ally of the great Sia Kingdom, US. If I had known, I would have begged the great SEAK Kingdom instead of India.</p>
<p>Someone even posted a firecrackers emoji. The caption read, &quot;Celebrating the successful explosion of the US starship. The reactions from countries around the world have been explosive. King Sartra watching the news smiled and said to the prince, &quot;Luckily, we didn&#x27;t get involved with the US. It&#x27;s safer to stick close to the great Sia Kingdom, their powerful ally.&quot; The president of Iraq tweeted directly.</p>
<p>Choosing a reliable partner is more important than anything else. Media outlets in neutral countries have widely reported on this. The explosion of the US Starship exposed a loophole in the supply chain with components from India being the culprit. Launch center optin regaining his composure gave the order with a grim face. Truth announced it to the public immediately.</p>
<p>just say that the starship exploded because it used parts from the great Sia Kingdom. They the Americans have become a laughingtock worldwide, but it also drags the SIA kingdom into it. Durret frowned and reminded him, President, won&#x27;t doing this anger the great Sia Kingdom. Optin glared at him and said nonchalantly, &quot;What are you afraid of? Our relationship with the great Sia Kingdom has now reached a freezing point. If we&#x27;re not having an easy time, they shouldn&#x27;t expect to either.&quot; He paused, then continued with his instructions.</p>
<p>Investigate the specific reasons at the same time. If it is found that the problem originated from parts from India, demand $100 billion in compensation from them. Dur paused for a moment. Isn&#x27;t that a bit too much? Optin&#x27;s eyes were filled with rage. It made us lose face all over the world and cost us over 10 billion US.</p>
<p>The Indians must pay the price. Musk stood to the side. I dare not utter a sound. He was afraid that opt-in would hold him accountable, but he knew it too. Someone definitely has to take the blame for this incident.</p>
<p>Musk can only pray that he&#x27;s not the one to take the blame. Chapter 88. The eagle lowers its proud head at the same time as the Starship exploded. The entire story of the US also exploded. The Dow Jones and NASDAQ composite indexes plummeted.</p>
<p>In particular, Tesla s stock market owned by Musk. The circuit breaker is triggered continuously. The market value plummeted. Wall Street was in turmoil. Many of them simply jumped off the rooftop.</p>
<p>At the same time, the White House website issued a red notice. The main cause of the Starship explosion was a defective component exported from the Great Sea Kingdom. We reserve the right to pursue legal action. The news came out. The global live stream chat exploded instantly.</p>
<p>American nitizens were stunned. One second they were wailing over the Starship crash. The next second he was speechless, choked by the government&#x27;s actions. How can you blame this on the great SA kingdom? Where&#x27;s your shame? Our starships use vows from India. Has the government gone mad? I&#x27;m ashamed of them.</p>
<p>They chose these garbage parts themselves and now they&#x27;re turning around and blaming me. Americans felt ashamed upon seeing this announcement. I&#x27;ve seen shameless people. I have never seen anyone lie through their teeth to sherk responsibility. They took to the streets holding banners and denouncing the American government as shameless.</p>
<p>They directly demanded that Optton step down, especially after learning that the stock market had crashed as a result. Americans are demanding that the government foot the bill for the losses caused by the stock market. On the other side, the little idiots from Sakura National Park continued to join in the commotion. Damn it, the Great Sa Kingdom is so wicked, resorting to such despicable tactics. The Great Sa Kingdom is shameless.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll stop at nothing to hinder the development of space technology in the United States. Little Baka doesn&#x27;t care about the truth as long as the Great Sea Kingdom can be made to take the blame. They then spared no effort in fanning the flames. South Korean nizens also joined in the slander. Damn it.</p>
<p>I knew the Great Sea Kingdom was a despicable nation. It was one thing for them to steal our laser weapon technology before, but now they&#x27;re pulling these shady tricks. In the comment section, all the comments were slanderous against the Great Sea Kingdom. Nizens in the great Sia Kingdom are completely enraged. Holy crap.</p>
<p>Has the US completely lost all shame? They used Indian garbage parts to blow it up and now they dare to blame us. Where&#x27;s their shame? It seems the US is really in a hurry. Siaki Yuan Li Jian Guo was so angry that his hands were shaking when he saw the announcement from the United States. This is outrageous. This is utterly turning black into white.</p>
<p>Lyn Shan, on the contrary, remained very calm and composed. It was as if nothing had happened. Oldly let them say what they want. When our space fighters have their test flights, we&#x27;ll teach them a lesson and they&#x27;ll behave. Moreover, I believe the country will definitely retaliate.</p>
<p>After listening, Lie Jango nodded, agreeing with the point. That&#x27;s right. The country will definitely retaliate accordingly. Then he asked curiously, &quot;You mean you&#x27;ll deal with them on the day of the test flight? How will you do that?&quot; Lynn Chun smiled mysteriously. He you&#x27;ll find out when the time comes.</p>
<p>Just as Lie Jian Guo was about to press for more information of the great Sia Kingdom issued an announcement on its official website. The components used in the US starships are all sourced independently by the US and have nothing to do with us. The so-called defective parts from the Great Sa Kingdom is pure nonsense. The US is given 24 hours to issue a public apology or we will take all necessary measures to protect our rights. Those who offend our great SIA though far away shall be punished.</p>
<p>The announcement was released. The world was in uproar. Media outlets in neutral countries widely shared and commented on the post. The great SEA kingdom is truly resolute. This is the attitude a great power should have.</p>
<p>Those who slander should pay the price. Even the US countries that were previously observing, they also stood up and spoke out at this moment. We demand that the US provide evidence. The United States international image plummeted instantly. At the same time, in the warehouse of the US launch center, Durit brought along a technician.</p>
<p>The remaining Indian valves are being inspected. Examine him carefully. The technician is holding tools. Carefully cut open the valve casing. When you see the material inside, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Chief, Chief, this isn&#x27;t titanium alloy. It&#x27;s aluminum alloy. The surface is painted silver, making it look like titanium alloy, but it&#x27;s actually fake. The technician&#x27;s voice trembled. The valve in his hand instantly fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Durret picked up the valve, waited in his hand, and turned pale. It really is a problem with India. They&#x27;re using aluminum alloy to impersonate titanium alloy. He suddenly looked up, his eyes filled with rage. Contact India immediately.</p>
<p>make them pay 100 billion US dollars in compensation, not a penny less. The news reached India. Demo was holding a cabinet meeting. Upon hearing the request from the US, he burst out laughing. 100 billion US.</p>
<p>Is the US desperate for money? The US chose the components themselves and now they want to shift the blame when problems arise. Then he directly instructed his secretary, go and issue a statement in response to the US. Take our Indian craftsmanship for example. It&#x27;s recognized all over the world. They&#x27;re the ones who don&#x27;t know how to use it, yet they dare to slander us.</p>
<p>You want us to pay you back? No way. Let them come and beat us up if they dare. The announcement from India has been released. The entire planet Earth became even more lively. Indian nizens instantly went wild.</p>
<p>Exactly. The US is stupid, yet it dares to blame us. Trying to rip us off? Dream on. If there&#x27;s a next time, we&#x27;ll dare to do it again. The entire Indian state does not believe they have done anything wrong.</p>
<p>Even if they use aluminum alloy as a substitute, it&#x27;s also a problem of their own. The US, why wasn&#x27;t it detected before use? If everything has been used, then there&#x27;s no problem. They&#x27;re showing off now. But not long after their own family encountered the same situation. Only then did I realize what it means for karma to be unforgiving.</p>
<p>The White House of the US. Optin was so angry when he saw the announcement from India that he smashed his cup. Assel, how dare India openly mock us? How dare they? Durret stood to the side and whispered, &quot;President, the evidence is now conclusive. It&#x27;s a problem with India. We can no longer rely on the great Sia Kingdom.&quot; Upton glared at him, but didn&#x27;t argue.</p>
<p>He knew in his heart that if he continued to stubbornly persist, he would only embarrass himself further. &quot;Pass on my order, a public apology.&quot; After saying that sentence, Opton looked several years older. This apology represents the US bowing down to the great sea kingdom. This is the first time since World War II and it was the only time. A few minutes later, the White House website, a brief announcement was released.</p>
<p>The previous statements regarding defective parts in the Great Sa Kingdom contained inaccurate information. We hereby apologize to the great Sia Kingdom. The apology announcement caused a global uproar. Netzens in the Great Sa Kingdom cheered with joy. We won.</p>
<p>The Americans have finally bowed their proud heads. Huh? Our motherland has finally become strong, and no one can bully us now. Let&#x27;s see who dares to slander us again. Siakiuan. Lie Jian Guo looked at the apology announcement from the United States.</p>
<p>He patted Lin Shun on the shoulder with a smile. Little Lynn, you guessed right again. Lynn Chins lips curled into a smile. This is just the beginning. Next, it&#x27;s time for our white emperor aerospace fighter to make its maiden flight.</p>
<p>When the time comes, we will let the whole world know that the space age of the great Sia Kingdom has arrived. And at this time, the US optin sat in his office, his face terribly grim. Great Sia Kingdom, we&#x27;ll settle this score with you sooner or later. He picked up the phone and dialed NASA&#x27;s number. The reason for the Starship&#x27;s failure has been found.</p>
<p>Continue to increase investment and develop the next generation of starships. We must surpass the great SEA Kingdom in the space domain. Chapter 89. The maiden flight of the white emperor&#x27;s space fighter. Lunar New Year&#x27;s Eve.</p>
<p>The snow in Kyoto is falling heavily. Red couplets are pasted all over the streets and alleys. The lantern swayed warmly in the wind and snow. 10:00 a.m. 2 hours until bite&#x27;s maiden flight.</p>
<p>There weren&#x27;t many people on the streets of the great Sea Kingdom. They all went back to their own homes or to their television sets. We&#x27;re looking at their phone. Everyone is waiting for the live broadcast of the maiden flight of the bite aerospace fighter jet at 10:00. Siakiuan By aerospace fighter test site.</p>
<p>In the center of the field, a fighter jet covered with a white canvas stood silently. The streamlined silhouette is faintly visible through the canvas test monitoring center. Besides Lin Shun Li Jian Guo and other staff members of the Siaku Institute, two other high-ranking military representatives were also present. Old Jang, aren&#x27;t you going home for New Year&#x27;s Eve? What are you doing here? Air Force Commander Lus eyes were full of excitement and pride. Old Lu, look at your smug little face.</p>
<p>General rolled his eyes at him. You think you can come, but I can&#x27;t? Yes, definitely. Commander Lu patted General on the shoulder. I&#x27;ll show you our air force&#x27;s prized possession in a bit. He General said with a hint of sourness.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be so smug. I&#x27;ll apply for priority deployment in our Kyoto war zone. Old Jang, you can&#x27;t be so shameless. Commander Lee immediately became agitated. These are our Air Force fighter jets.</p>
<p>If you dare to steal them, I&#x27;ll fight you to the death. Lie Jian Guo, standing to the side, looked at the two of them, shook his head, and said helplessly to Lynch, Shaolin, it seems your White Emperor Space Fighter is in high demand. I heard that recently the major military regions have been doing a lot of work to be among the first to receive this equipment. They even held a large-scale military skills competition at the end. Lynchan rubbed his nose and laughed.</p>
<p>It can&#x27;t be that bad. The mass production of aerospace fighters will be very fast. There&#x27;s no need to rush. The production process for aerospace fighter jets has been fully completed. They are all produced in modular form and then assembled.</p>
<p>It can even be transformed into an automated production line. The production speed of assembly line operations will never be slow as long as the military fully cooperates. Producing dozens of units a day is no problem. Lie Jian Guo chuckled and said, &quot;They don&#x27;t know. They all want to be the starting lineup.&quot; Lynch and checked the time.</p>
<p>It will be 10:00 in 20 minutes. Begin immediately. Have the pilots prepared aboard. Then let&#x27;s start the live stream. All right.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo agreed. then said to General Jeang and the others, &quot;Old Jang, stop arguing. It&#x27;s about to begin. It&#x27;s about to start.&quot; General Jeang and Commander Lu immediately stopped arguing and instantly became excited. Lie Jian Guo then instructed his staff to contact the pilot to board the plane.</p>
<p>Pilot&#x27;s lounge. Air Force Ace pilot Lu Xiaoyang was waiting anxiously. He is 35 years old this year. He was an ace pilot in the Air Force. A month ago, he was secretly arranged for special simulation training.</p>
<p>At first, he didn&#x27;t know the reason. Later, after learning that it was for the maiden flight of the mighty aerospace fighter jet, he was so excited that he couldn&#x27;t sleep for several nights. This is the glory that every pilot dreams of. Being able to pilot such an advanced aerospace fighter on its maiden flight means he will be recorded in aviation history. Lu Xiaoyang checked his flight equipment again.</p>
<p>From helmets to flight suits, no detail is overlooked. He was well aware of the importance of this mission. It is not only about personal honor, but also about the development of the country&#x27;s aviation industry. Come on, you can do it this time. Lu Xiaoyang clenched his fist and punched himself.</p>
<p>This is to calm down the tense and excited feeling. At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Pilot Luo prepared a board. Okay, coming right away. Lu Xiaoyang was excited and then walked towards the tarmac.</p>
<p>At the same time, the live stream is now live. The number of people is skyrocketing at a rate of hundreds of thousands per second. The barrage of comments scrolled across the screen like a tidal wave, almost obscuring the view. It&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s here.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been waiting for a month. It&#x27;s finally here. I&#x27;m so excited. It&#x27;s finally time for our bitey sky fighter to make its maiden flight. Our building management set up a projector and now the area downstairs is packed with people.</p>
<p>Haha. This is how we make it more exciting. I can&#x27;t wait. Quickly switch the camera to the bitey space fighter. Almost the entire population of the great SEA Kingdom.</p>
<p>Everyone is watching this historic live broadcast. Even staff members who were on duty were allowed to watch the live stream during their spare time. It is evident how important the maiden flight of the bitey aerospace fighter jet is to the great sea kingdom. This will be a significant chapter in the aviation history of the great SEA kingdom. It symbolizes a dual leap forward in the nation&#x27;s scientific and technological strength and military power.</p>
<p>As the camera slowly zooms in, the white canvas covering the bitey aerospace fighter jet was carefully peeled off by the staff. The bitey aerospace fighter jet has finally revealed its full form. The entire room fell silent instantly. The next second, the chat in the live stream exploded. Wow, this face is so handsome.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s got me right to the core. This streamlined fuselage is even more futuristic than the ones in the movies. The silver gray shell gleams coldly in the snow. It&#x27;s so cool, huh? The US&#x27;s big iron barrel is just garbage compared to our white emperor fighter jets. The excitement of the viewers in front of the live stream screen was almost overflowing.</p>
<p>They all wish they could jump through the screen and come to the scene to watch. On the tarmac, the body aerospace fighter jet is about 20 m long. The Fuselov has a smooth spindle-shaped design and no traditional wings, only slightly raised deflectors on both sides. The nose is sharp like a knife that cuts through the air. There were no exhaust nozzles at the tail, only an energy panel that shimmerred with blue light.</p>
<p>The most amazing part is the side of the fuselof. On one side are the two red characters, Dashap Dia. Adorned with golden dragon patterns. It stands out strikingly against a silver gray background. On the other side is body number one.</p>
<p>Those large black characters seemed to exude an unparalleled air of dominance. This highlights the unique identity of this fighter jet. Lu Xiaoyang had already arrived beside the fighter jet. He looked up at the space plane he had always dreamed of. Although it wasn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;d met, but my heart is still brimming with passion.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Lu Xiaoyang boarded the plane directly, then closed the hatch. testing center. The other engineers got busy. Only General Jeang and Commander Lu stared wideeyed at the bitey sky fighter, utterly shocked. A moment later, they finally came to their senses.</p>
<p>He swallowed hard, his eyes filled with excitement. This is incredible. This fighter jet is even more futuristic than those in science fiction movies. Commander Lou spoke first, his voice filled with excitement and enthusiasm. Yes, if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes, I would have thought it was a model.</p>
<p>General Jeang was filled with emotion. The fighter jets in front of us. It was the most shocking and advanced thing he had ever seen in his life without exception. Chief designer Lynn, could you please describe the performance of this fighter jet? General turned his head and looked at Lyn Shan with anticipation. Lynshan smiled but did not give a direct response.</p>
<p>General Xang, the maiden flight is about to begin. I&#x27;ll give you a more detailed introduction later. All right, General Jeang did not press further. Continue watching the White Emperor fighter jets on the tarmac. On board the White Emperor fighter jet, pilot Luo Xiaoyang has initiated the fighter jet selfch check procedure according to the operation manual.</p>
<p>Soon, White Emperor completed its self inspection. Command center body self inspection complete, requesting takeoff. Clearance for takeoff receive. After receiving the order, Luos Xiaoyang immediately pressed the takeoff button. Takeoff countdown begins.</p>
<p>10 seconds left. 10 9 8 Chapter 90. The US&#x27;s insidious tactics. The countdown has begun. Everyone&#x27;s heart was in their throat.</p>
<p>Even the live stream chat seemed to be paused at this moment. The viewers in front of the screen held their breath. Testing center. The engineers were just as nervous. Their eyes were glued to the screen.</p>
<p>The countdown ticks by 1 second. They got a little nervous. Lyn Shan was the only one who remained calm throughout the entire event because he had faith in the White Emperor on the White Emperor fighter jet. Lu Xiaoyang stared at the dashboard. The control stick was soaked with sweat from my palms.</p>
<p>5 4 3 2 1 start up. The words fell. Luos Xiaoyang pressed the green start button. The deflectors on both sides of the bitey aerospace fighter instantly lit up with blue light. The tail sections energy panel hummed and a pale blue halo spread out.</p>
<p>The dust on the ground trembled slightly. There is no roar of traditional fighter jets. There was only a deep resonant sound as if it came from the universe. Anti-gravity plasma engine started successfully. Lu Xiaoyang felt nothing.</p>
<p>On the big screen, it has been shown that the white Emperor fighter jet has already taken off. 1 m, 10 m, 50 m. The silver gray fuselage rose vertically into the air as if being lifted up by an invisible hand. The streamlined body gleamed coldly in the snow. The red characters Dasha Da and the golden dragon pattern are particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>What or is it vertical takeoff? General Jeang leaned forward abruptly, his eyes wide open. At first, he thought it was taking off by gliding. What an unexpected surprise. Commander Lu slapped his thigh, filled with excitement. Haha, it really is anti-gravity.</p>
<p>The US&#x27;s vertical takeoff capability is garbage. Lie Jian Guo stared at the screen, his eyes filled with excitement. It&#x27;s done. We&#x27;ve done it. The engineers were instantly furious.</p>
<p>Success. The engine is working properly. The altitude is still increasing. It&#x27;s already 1,000 m. It&#x27;s about to accelerate.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so excited. The anti-gravity takeoff was successful. This proves that Bid has already succeeded halfway. Lynchin calmly observed their reactions. He is even more excited about B&#x27;s performance.</p>
<p>Next takeoff is just one small step. According to his plan, the most exciting moment was yet to come. He had already prepared a New Year&#x27;s gift for the people of the great Sia Kingdom. In the live stream, the moment Bide successfully took off, the comment section erupted again. What kind of cuttingedge technology is this? Vertical takeoff without any noise.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s incredibly cool. It&#x27;s even more amazing than the fighter jets in the movies. Could it be the legendary anti-gravity? Whether it is or not, this technology far surpasses that of the US&#x27;s starships. Great SEA is awesome. The screen was filled with scrolling red bullet comments.</p>
<p>Someone posted a raising the national flag emoji instantly became uniform. Streets and alleys. Someone was holding up their phone to live stream, jumping and cheering. The traffic police officer on duty stopped and stared at the large advertising screen on the roadside. The maiden flight of BY was also being broadcast live at that time.</p>
<p>His eyes were full of pride. A certain village. An old soldier leans on a cane staring at the television. Tears welled up in his cloudy eyes. Back then we didn&#x27;t have airplanes.</p>
<p>Now we have the best. The same scenario. It was staged throughout the great Sea Kingdom. Veterans who lived through that era. Everyone knew how hard one this moment was for the great SIA kingdom.</p>
<p>Only through experience can they truly understand. Many veterans couldn&#x27;t help but get teary eyed as they watched. At the same time, the White House of the US opt staring at the live stream. His face was so gloomy it looked like it could drip water. The coffee on the table had gone cold.</p>
<p>He clenched his fist tightly and slammed it on the table. Damn it. How could the great Sia Kingdom possibly have such technology? NASA administrator Trudeau turned pale. Mr. President, this this is not a traditional fighter jet at all.</p>
<p>We have never seen this kind of technology before. Fighter jets without thrust vectoring nozzles. This was the first time he had met him. The key is still vertical takeoff and it was as stable as if it were standing still on flat ground. This completely overturned his understanding of aviation technology.</p>
<p>Unless there is one possibility, that is anti-gravity technology. But that&#x27;s simply not something that current Earth technology can achieve. Could it be that the Great Sa Kingdom has really done it? Impossible. Absolutely impossible. Durret frantically denied it in his mind.</p>
<p>He absolutely did not believe that the Great Sa Kingdom had actually developed anti-gravity technology. The entire blue planet for decades. There has been no breakthrough to truly achieve anti-gravity. Almost none. It has always been in the theoretical stage.</p>
<p>Optton paced back and forth in his office. Suddenly, he stopped, his eyes filled with ruthlessness. We can&#x27;t let them succeed. If the great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s fighter jets really fly into space, &quot;Do you have any way to make our Starling fighters go out of control and accidentally crash into them?&quot; Dur was stunned when he heard this. He immediately realized what was happening and stammered.</p>
<p>Mr. President, you mean? That&#x27;s right. We&#x27;ll use our Starlink satellites to directly collide with the Great Sea Kingdoms warplanes. We must defeat them no matter what. Optin&#x27;s eyes were filled with madness.</p>
<p>Their starship mission just failed, making them a laughingtock worldwide. We absolutely cannot allow the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s maiden flight to succeed. If the other party does not fly out of Blue Star, that proves that the other side has not yet reached the level of aerospace fighters. As long as it&#x27;s inside Earth, that threat isn&#x27;t too great. If it really were possible to fly out of Earth, the nature of them is completely different.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom must be defeated. But Mr. President, if we really use our satellite to collide with their incoming fighter jets, will the Great Sea Kingdom retaliate against us fiercely? Then Trudeau offered his advice with deep concern. They still have 8,100 Starlink satellites in orbit, if it is really necessary. It is definitely possible.</p>
<p>But can they bear the consequences? The laser weapons of the Great Sea Kingdom are so advanced. What if the Great Sea Kingdom retaliates? They directly and relentlessly destroyed their Starlink satellites from the ground. They were completely helpless. The Great Sa Kingdom had already destroyed three of their Starlink satellites. OP completely ignored all advice.</p>
<p>Revenge. I&#x27;ll just say the satellite went out of control on its own. Could the great SEA Kingdom really violate international space conventions? Just go ahead and do it. I&#x27;ll take responsibility for whatever happens. Trudeau saw how determined the president was.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t say anything more. Yes, Mr. President. I&#x27;ll go back and make the arrangements right away. After saying that, Durret left first.</p>
<p>Optin stood by the office window, looking at the lawn outside. The great Sia Kingdom. You want to soar into space. Dream. Chapter 91.</p>
<p>The disgusting conspiracy of the Sakura country, the land of cherry blossoms. Little Baka saw the white emperor fighter jet successfully take off. Everyone was filled with dissatisfaction. Baka, how come the great Sia Kingdom possesses such advanced technology? It&#x27;s infuriating. They were so backward 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Why are they like this now? Emitarasu, you must protect them from failure. You absolutely cannot let them succeed in their first flight. It would be great if the US could shoot down the great Sia&#x27;s fighter jets with missiles. Almost everyone who watched the live stream was filled with jealousy and resentment. They could not accept the great Sia kingdom which they had once regarded as a backward nation.</p>
<p>Today, it has achieved such remarkable success in the aviation field. In particular, they were well aware of the hatred the great Sia Kingdom harbored towards them. They were worried that once the great Sia Kingdom rose to power, it would seek revenge against them. Prime Minister&#x27;s office. Jurro Kishida stared at the screen.</p>
<p>His face looked worse than if he had eaten a dead fly. Baka. He abruptly swept the teacup off the table and onto the floor. The sound of porcelain shattering echoed in the office. Why is the great Sia Kingdom able to build such a fighter jet? Our Japanese Shinshin fighter jets can&#x27;t even take off on a taxi.</p>
<p>The secretary next to him shrank back in fright. I didn&#x27;t dare to respond. Kishaurro was panting heavily, his face ashen. He recalled, &quot;10 years ago, Japan can still follow the US and swagger in front of China. But now the technology of the great Sia Kingdom has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Quantum optical chips, laser cannons, space fighters. In every aspect, Japan has left the country far behind. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. No, we can&#x27;t let the great Sia Kingdom steal the limelight like this. Kisha Deajiro&#x27;s eyes suddenly turned sinister.</p>
<p>Issue an announcement immediately. I&#x27;m going to pay my respects at the Yasakuni Shrine this afternoon. I want the great Sia Kingdom to know that our cherry blossom kingdom has never submitted. The secretary was stunned. Prime Minister, will offering sacrifices now provoke the great Sia Kingdom? Infuriated, Kishida Jiro sneered.</p>
<p>The angrier the great Sia Kingdom gets, the more I want to go. I just want to discuss them. They&#x27;re celebrating. I&#x27;ll make them suffer. Seeing Kishida Jiro&#x27;s erratic behavior, the secretary didn&#x27;t say anything more.</p>
<p>He turned around and went to issue the announcement. Soon the announcement was released. The little idiots at Sakura Elementary School went wild in an instant. Wow. Prime Minister Kishida is so brave.</p>
<p>We should show the great Sia Kingdom our backbone. The heroes in the Yasakuni shrine will bless us to surpass the great Sia Kingdom. Most of the little bastards make arrogant remarks. They are still living in the fantasy of the past completely unaware. They suffered retaliation because of this announcement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Great Sia Kingdom Testing Center. The altitude of the White Emperor fighter jets has exceeded 1,000 m. The ground staff all looked up. Not a single black dot could be seen in the sky. Holy crap, where are the fighter jets? General Jean got so excited that he started swearing and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>He scanned the sky with his binoculars. They couldn&#x27;t find any trace of the White Emperor fighter jet. It was as if it had vanished into thin air. If it weren&#x27;t for the monitoring center still showing that everything in BY was normal, he thought BY had lost contact with him. This stealth capability is just too outrageous.</p>
<p>Previous stealth fighters simply couldn&#x27;t achieve visual stealth. Commander Louu was also deeply moved and exclaimed, &quot;If this were on the battlefield, the enemy wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a target at all. The White Emperor fighter jet is simply the perfect killer.&quot; Lyn Shin explained with a smile. The new stealth material used by White Emperor. It can achieve complete stealth.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x27;s visual, thermal imaging, radar, or satellite, it can achieve perfect stealth. Impressive. General took a deep breath. He This is just the beginning. There will be a surprise soon.</p>
<p>Lynch smiled mysteriously. At this time, BY has ascended vertically to an altitude of 2,000 m. Sudden, the White Emperor fighter jet adjusts its fuselof. Then the speed started to skyrocket. Mach 1, Mach 2, Mach 5.</p>
<p>It sped up. Someone shouted. Everyone&#x27;s eyes were instantly drawn to the screen. Inside the cockpit, Lu Xiaoyang gripped the control lever tightly. A notification sound came from the White Emperor AI about to enter supersonic cruise mode.</p>
<p>Target: Edge of the atmosphere. He took a deep breath, pressed the acceleration button. The speed numbers on the screen continued to climb. Mach 10, Mach 12, Mach 15. In just 10 seconds, the White Emperor&#x27;s fighter jet broke through Mach 15.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s equivalent to flying 5 km/s at this time. Testing center. Great. Acceleration is normal. So stable.</p>
<p>The pilot was not injured by the overload even though he accelerated to Mach 15 in a short time. Chief designer Lynn is amazing. His cockpit design is absolutely perfect. All the engineers looked at Lin Shawn with eyes full of admiration. Only a normal human body wearing a special flight suit can withstand an overload of 9g.</p>
<p>Even in extreme cases, it can only withstand an overload of 12g. However, accelerating to Mach 15 in 10 seconds would cause a 52g overload. Even wearing a special space suit can cause irreversible damage to the human body or even death. But the cockpit of the white emperor space fighter, it is specially designed. This situation can be completely avoided.</p>
<p>Even if it increases to Mach 15 in 1 second, as long as you&#x27;re inside the cockpit, there won&#x27;t be any impact. This demonstrates just how advanced Lin Chin&#x27;s cockpit design is. While the engineers were excited, General and Commander Lu stared wideeyed, looking utterly dumbfounded. A few seconds later, General Jeang was the first to regain his senses, filled with shock and emotion. Chief Engineer Lynn, you guys are really amazing.</p>
<p>A fighter jet reaching Mach 15 is simply incredible. How exactly did you do that? He thought the White Emperor battle opportunity would be excellent. But I never imagined it would be this outrageous. This speed is comparable to that of a strategic intercontinental ballistic missile. Ordinary missiles pose no threat to this fighter jet.</p>
<p>They couldn&#x27;t even catch up with him. Commander Lu looked at Lynshin with awe and gave him a thumbs up. Chief Engineer Lynn, you&#x27;re awesome. Although he had previously learned about the parameters of the White Emperor space fighter, but seeing it in person is a different story. Lynch smiled and said, &quot;This speed isn&#x27;t the limit yet.</p>
<p>The speed can be increased once we get to space. This isn&#x27;t the limit yet.&quot; General Xang was completely stunned and numb. He was beyond words to describe. I could only silently look at the large monitoring screen in the live stream. The image has switched to the large screen in the monitoring center.</p>
<p>The audience in Dasha was completely in an uproar. Holy crap. Mach 15. Is this going to fly up to the sky and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the sun. Am I seeing things faster than a missile? This is outrageous.</p>
<p>A fighter jet at Mach 15. Great. Sea is awesome. Bite is awesome. Some netizens even started posting rocket effects.</p>
<p>The number of viewers in the live stream exceeded 1 billion, directly breaking the platform&#x27;s limit. The entire Great Sea Kingdom was plunged into a frenzy of celebration. For them, this is the best New Year&#x27;s gift. Even the announcements released by Japan are temporarily going unnoticed. All attention was focused on the live broadcast of the maiden flight of the White Emperor.</p>
<p>In the air, 1 minute after the White Emperor fighter jet reached Mach 15, the fighter jets have reached the edge of the atmosphere. The mighty intelligent voice prompt sounded about to break through the atmosphere. Luos Xiaoyang was filled with excitement. Command center requesting entry into space orbit. Lynchin did not hesitate and gave the order directly.</p>
<p>Approve. Entering space. Fly around the Earth once. Lynchin hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. A staff member rushed in.</p>
<p>Chief engineer Lynn. Something terrible has happened. Japan has announced that Kishidurro will be visiting the Yasakuni ghost toilet this afternoon. Lynshin frowned, then immediately changed his mind. circle halfway around the ground, then land above the haunted toilet in Japan.</p>
<p>Chapter 92 fully loaded with quantum annihilation bombs. Lynshin had just finished speaking. The testing center fell silent instantly. General Jeang paused for a moment, then seemed to realize something. Chief Engineer Lynn, what are you trying to do? Lynch nodded.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. This time, White Emperor is actually fully loaded with quantum annihilation bombs. Didn&#x27;t the Japanese devils want to pay homage? Then let them worship to their hearts content. General Jeang did not refute this after listening. Then he patted Lynshin on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Well done, Chief Designer Len. It&#x27;s time to teach those little devils a lesson in blood. The great Sia Kingdom of today. They are no longer afraid of any provocation, especially after the bitey aerospace fighter jet was acquired. Some grudges deserve some interest.</p>
<p>Commander Lu also gave his full approval. Chief Engineer Lynn, go ahead and do it with confidence. If anything happens, we&#x27;ll cover for you. If it were in the past, if someone says they want to blow up the haunted toilet, he might try to persuade him. They were afraid of creating unnecessary international disputes.</p>
<p>But things are different now. The great Sia Kingdom has become powerful. And then there&#x27;s Lin Shun, this prodigy scientist. If you are provoked, you should fight back directly. Lynshan added, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, it won&#x27;t cause any disputes.</p>
<p>With the White Emperors stealth capabilities, even if we bomb the Japanese to the point of sinking, they still won&#x27;t be able to detect us. Chief Engineer Lynn, we believe in you, General said earnestly. I&#x27;ll inform the higher-ups about this so they can make preparations. Lynshin nodded slightly. Then I&#x27;ll have to trouble General Xang.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s okay to do this kind of thing even if it&#x27;s done, but it&#x27;s still necessary to notify the higher-ups. General Xang went out and returned in less than a minute. He approached Lynn Shun and said excitedly, &quot;Chief Engineer Lynn, the higher-ups are telling you to go ahead and do your job with confidence. The nation is your strongest support.&quot; The words had barely left his mouth. Commander Lu, who was standing to the side, was also shocked.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the higher-ups valued Lynn Chin so much. Not only did he not refute Lin Chin&#x27;s idea, we also have to cover his losses. He had originally been thinking, &quot;What if the higher-ups blame us? He took all the responsibility upon himself. Lynch must not be punished. It seems that it&#x27;s no longer necessary.</p>
<p>The higher-ups value Lynn Chun more than anyone else. Lie Jian Guo stood to the side, unable to describe his feelings at that moment. Only Lynch could be treated this way by the higher-ups. A warm feeling welled up in Lynchen&#x27;s heart. The nation&#x27;s trust in him is a two-way street.</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt his shoulders were even heavier. They bear the expectations and heavy responsibilities entrusted to them by the nation. His gaze was firm and he spoke in a calm tone. Thank you for the country&#x27;s trust and support. I, Lynchun, will certainly live up to your expectations.</p>
<p>Make those enemies who dare to provoke us pay the price they deserve. At the same time, it will also allow our great Sia Kingdom to stand at the top of the world so that all the people of our great SEA kingdom may live a happy and peaceful life. Good. Good. Good.</p>
<p>General Jang said three times in a row without saying much more. All the meaning is already contained in those three words. Li Jang Wos gaze towards Lin Chin changed. He wanted to praise Lin Chin. But at this moment, he was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Even Commander Lu watched Lin Chin silently. Such a genius, yet with the heart of a child. They always kept the lives of ordinary people in mind. How precious that is. He asked himself honestly and realized that even he himself might not be able to do it.</p>
<p>The surrounding engineers looked at Lynchon with great respect. Seeing that the atmosphere had suddenly become somewhat tense, Lynshin smiled and tried to ease the tension. Don&#x27;t be so serious, everyone. We&#x27;re not going to do anything bad. We&#x27;re just letting those with ill intentions know that the great Sa Kingdom is not to be trifled with.</p>
<p>Continue our first flight test. The engineers snapped out of their days. Yes, let&#x27;s continue testing. The Japanese devils are right there. They can&#x27;t escape.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll play with them properly after we finish testing. All the engineers then focus their attention on the maiden flight test of BY. At this time, BY has already entered the atmosphere. The orange red plasma flame envelopes the fuselof, forming a scorching barrier. This is the atmospheric blackout region.</p>
<p>Normally, the signal would be completely blocked, but there was no change on the test center screen. The engineers attempted to contact Bid calling Bid. Is everything normal? Soon, Lu Xiaoyangs excited voice rang out. Bid received it. Everything is normal.</p>
<p>BY continue to carry out the flight mission according to Chief Engineer Lynn&#x27;s instructions. Receive. Chief Engineer Lynn. Everything is normal. The engineer gave an excited report.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded. Everything was as he had anticipated. Currently, no country on Earth has fully solved the problem of communication under atmospheric blackout. Every time a rocket or space transport spacecraft is launched, there will be a brief period of loss of contact. Sometimes unexpected accidents can happen during these times when contact is lost.</p>
<p>Even the great SEA kingdom has been developing in the field of space for so many years. We have only just found a way to keep communication going in the dark, but it&#x27;s just about keeping in touch. It&#x27;s not very stable yet. But the White Emperor&#x27;s communication design, it can be done without any impact whatsoever. It&#x27;s just like regular ground communication.</p>
<p>This demonstrates just how advanced this communication technology is. After listening, General Jeang looked at Lyn Shun, his eyes filled with shock. Chief Engineer Lynn, &quot;What? What&#x27;s going on?&quot; The signal isn&#x27;t lost in the blackout zone. Lynch smiled and explained. Bite used a new type of anti-inference material that can penetrate the blackout zone and maintain uninterrupted communication throughout the process.</p>
<p>General Jeang paused for a few seconds, then suddenly burst into laughter, &quot;Great, excellent technique. With this, we can monitor our fighter jets in any area in real time.&quot; Commander Lou couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim in admiration, &quot;This technology is worldclass again. The Americans would be furious if they saw this.&quot; Soon, the White Emperor broke through the atmosphere and entered space. The whole process took less than a minute. We&#x27;ve made a breakthrough.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve successfully entered space. At the testing center, the engineers cheered. This indicates that the White Emperor fighter jet has passed its most dangerous test. In all the test items, it is most dangerous when breaking through the atmosphere of Earth. It not only tests the material strength of the fighter jet&#x27;s fuselof.</p>
<p>It also tests the comprehensive performance of the fighter jet&#x27;s power system, thermal protection system, and flight control system. Even the smallest flaw could lead to a crash and loss of life. Without a doubt, body did it. It&#x27;s still so perfect. The people of the great Sea Kingdom in the live broadcast room went completely crazy.</p>
<p>Holy crap. We&#x27;ve really broken out of Earth. So exciting. This is the world&#x27;s first live broadcast of breaking through the blue line. Absolutely.</p>
<p>The live stream didn&#x27;t stop even when we passed through the blackout zone. My country is amazing. Who else can compare? The entire great sea kingdom was celebrating enthusiastically. However, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the president&#x27;s office, it was already 10 p.m. due to the time difference, but the White House remained brightly lit.</p>
<p>The president&#x27;s office. The moment Optton saw the White Emperor fighter jet burst out of blue star. His face turned ashen with anger. He picked up the phone and dialed Durit&#x27;s number. The call was answered very quickly.</p>
<p>Druid, I don&#x27;t care what methods you use. You must destroy that fighter jet from the Great Sea Kingdom. Chapter 93. Destroyed NASA Space Agency satellite control center. After hanging up the phone, Trudeau looked utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Well, let&#x27;s hope there won&#x27;t be any unexpected problems this time. He really wanted to refuse Optin&#x27;s order. They use Starlink satellites to collide with the war plananes of the Great Sa Kingdom. That would undoubtedly be the stupidest thing to do, but he couldn&#x27;t persuade him otherwise. They can only carry out presidential orders.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s begin. Find the flight path of the Great Sea Kingdoms fighter jets and then adjust the satellites flight path. Use as many satellites as possible that are nearing the end of their lifespan. This was the last thing Trudeau could do. He just hoped that this time he could succeed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he couldn&#x27;t even imagine the retaliation from the Great Sa Kingdom. The order has been issued. Technicians began searching for the White Emperor fighter jets on the satellite screens. Not long after, the technician excitedly reported, &quot;Director, we found the location.&quot; A necklace-shaped satellite flew right past the white Emperor fighter jet. &quot;They are very close.&quot; Trudeau nodded, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s begin.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; the technician responded. Then they began adjusting the orbits of 15 Starlink satellites that were nearing the end of their service life. It flew toward the white Emperor fighter jet. Near Earth space aerospace fighter jet. Inside the cockpit, Lu Xiaoyang looked out the driver&#x27;s window.</p>
<p>In the pitch black universe, countless stars shimmer like diamonds. The Milky Way stretches across the sky like a dazzling ribbon of light. And below, blue star is like a sparkling sapphire enveloped in white clouds. The coastline is clearly visible, and you can even see patches of city lights. Luos X Yaoyangs eyes were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so beautiful. This is our blue planet. He raised his hand and gently touched the cockpit window. It felt like touching this magnificent scenery. I could only see it in photos before, but now I can finally see it in person.</p>
<p>The intelligent voice prompts sound at the appropriate time. Currently at an altitude of 400 km, it is in low Earth orbit. Speed increased to Mach 20. Lu Xiaoyang took a deep breath and reported to the ground. Command center.</p>
<p>I have entered space. All is normal. Testing center. The screen simultaneously displays images of space. Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>General Jang stood there, a smile unconsciously spreading across his face, his eyes filled with pride. This is our great Sia Kingdoms fighter jet capable of taking our pilots to see the beautiful scenery of space. Commander Lu exclaimed with deep emotion. Yes, I never imagined this day would come so soon. Lie Jian Guo took out his phone, took a picture of the screen, and spoke excitedly.</p>
<p>This must be recorded. It is a milestone in our great Xian nation&#x27;s space program. The surrounding engineers, everyone took out their phones to record this historic moment. Even Linshin was a little excited. He yearned for space more than anyone else.</p>
<p>However, it won&#x27;t blindly follow suit and fly into space on its first maiden flight. He can go up and admire it slowly after the lunar base is built. In the live stream, the comment section was filled with praise. My god, is this space? It&#x27;s so beautiful. Bite is awesome.</p>
<p>Pilot Luo is so lucky to have witnessed such a beautiful view. As a citizen of Great Sea, I am so proud. This is the technological strength we should have. While the little bastard is still worshiping the ghost toilet were already soaring through space. All the people of the great Sia kingdom were captivated by the beauty of space and the blue planet.</p>
<p>At this moment, many people also know that Japan has a ritual to worship the ghost toilet. Despite the anger, but seeing how smoothly the White Emperor&#x27;s maiden flight went, they temporarily put their anger aside. Just as everyone was immersed in the beautiful scenery of space, an alarm suddenly went off in the monitoring center. Warning, multiple unidentified objects detected, rapidly approaching Bid. On the screen, 15 small dots are rushing towards Bide from different directions.</p>
<p>General Ciangs smile vanished instantly and his face darkened. What is that? Is it a missile? The engineer quickly typed on the keyboard and brought up a magnified view. It&#x27;s not a missile. It&#x27;s a Starling satellite from the US. They&#x27;re changing course.</p>
<p>Their target is Bitey. Commander Lu clenched his fists tightly, his eyes filled with rage. The Americans, they actually want to ram our fighter jets with a satellite. Lynchin also walked to the screen, but he wasn&#x27;t angry. He he, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time.</p>
<p>Saves me the trouble of looking for them. He already had a plan. They used the US&#x27;s Starlink satellites to test the power of the airborne laser cannons on White House fighter jets. That&#x27;s it. The US even delivered itself to their doorstep.</p>
<p>Then don&#x27;t blame him for being impolite. A sharp glint flashed in Lin Shen&#x27;s eyes as he swiftly issued the order. Lu Xiaoyang, intercept them immediately. Destroy them all. Leave no one alive.</p>
<p>Receive in space. Inside the cockpit of the White Emperor fighter jet, Lu Xiaoyang became excited. Great, we can finally have some real combat experience. He was not afraid at all. Instead, they were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>These are all achievements in battle. He had already made a contribution by successfully launching the maiden flight. But things are different now if we add an actual combat achievements. Your level will increase. Even when they go home, they can have a separate page in the family genealogy.</p>
<p>The more Lu Xiaoyang thought about it, the more excited he became. At this time, the airborne 3D visual radar has locked onto those 15 Starling satellites. He pressed the red button to fire the laser cannon. The laser cannons on both sides of the White Emperor&#x27;s fuselage instantly burst forth with blinding light. Two straight and blazing beams of light ripped through the dark space like lightning.</p>
<p>It shot towards the 15 Starling satellites. Moment. Two Starlink satellites were vaporized in space under the attack of the laser cannon. There was no sound. Even if it were, you wouldn&#x27;t hear it in space.</p>
<p>Haha, hit the bullseye. That was awesome. Continue. Lu Xiaoyang was completely excited. This was also his first time using a laser cannon.</p>
<p>I never imagined it would be so powerful and it&#x27;s so accurate. Keep in mind that Starlink satellites move at Mach 25. In this case, it hit the target on the first strike. This demonstrates just how powerful the White Emperor fighter jet&#x27;s automatic targeting function is. Then, Lu Xiaoyang kept firing.</p>
<p>The remaining Starlink satellites were destroyed one after another. Not long after, 15 Starlink satellites disappeared into space. It was as if it had never existed. The entire process took less than 30 seconds. That&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang paused for a moment, looking like he wanted more. He hasn&#x27;t had enough yet. How could it just disappear? The US s Starling satellites are too fragile. Lu Xiaoyang muttered a few complaints to himself. Then he began to report on the battle results.</p>
<p>Command center, all targets destroyed. Soon, Linshen&#x27;s order came. Very good. Continue searching for targets. Destroy any Starlink satellites you find.</p>
<p>Receive. Lu Xiaoyang became excited again. Haha, we can continue. Chapter 94. The US&#x27;s attempt to steal a chicken backfires.</p>
<p>Ground testing center. General Jeang and Commander Lu are still in a state of shock that destroyed 15 satellites. Chief Engineer Lynn, you&#x27;re incredibly fast. General looked incredulous, his mouth slightly agape and his eyes wide open from beginning to end. It seems like it only lasted less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>If it were a traditional weapon, it probably wouldn&#x27;t even have been aimed yet. But now, the laser weapon carried by the White Emperor has already destroyed the target. Outrageous. Lynn Chins lips twitched, and he said speechlessly, &quot;General Jeang, it&#x27;s the laser cannon that&#x27;s faster.&quot; General was stunned for a moment, then realized what he meant and exclaimed happily, &quot;Huh? Yes. Yes, it&#x27;s the laser cannon that&#x27;s faster.&quot; Commander Lu also recovered from his shock, filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn, look at these results. Bite is practically invincible in space. He also knew about the terror of the super laser cannon. But when you actually witness its power firsthand, I was still deeply shocked. Its power, especially in space, it seems even more terrifying than on the ground.</p>
<p>It is clear that the design power of airborne laser cannons is smaller than that of those on warships or land. But its power in space didn&#x27;t feel much less. There are even those that surpass it. It is clear that laser cannons are best used in space. Lynchin smiled and nodded, saying confidently.</p>
<p>Commander Lu, this is just the beginning. With continuous technological advancements, the power of the laser cannon will reach even greater heights. Only he knows. In the war between cosmic civilizations before reaching level 5 civilization, laser cannons are the mainstream attack method. Timeless.</p>
<p>Only after reaching level five civilization will technology experience a qualitative leap. At that point, laser weapons will lose their effectiveness in civilizational warfare. But that&#x27;s all for the future. Given the current level of technology in the great sea kingdom, it hasn&#x27;t even reached level one civilization. But dominating the blue planet is still very easy.</p>
<p>Chief engineer Lynn By must be put into mass production as soon as possible. Our great SA air force needs it. Commander Lu looked at Lin Chun. his tone full of sincerity. General Jeang also urgently requested Chief Engineer Lynn, you must ensure that White Emperor is mass-produced as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This will be a major weapon for our country. They hadn&#x27;t fully grasped the power of the White Emperor fighter jet before. It&#x27;s not that urgent yet. After seeing the White House&#x27;s extreme incident that destroyed 15 Starlink satellites belonging to the United States, they had already deeply realized the unparalleled strategic value of the White Emperor fighter jets equipped with laser cannons. The earlier mass production and deployment, the better, the more advantageous it is for the Great Sa Kingdom.&quot; Lynch nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, once the tests are successful, we can start mass production. Okay, well wait. Then they continued watching the aerospace fighter jet performance. At the same time, the viewers of the great Sia Kingdom in the live broadcast room. I don&#x27;t know what words to use to describe their excitement.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Was I watching a sci-fi movie just now? I actually saw a space battle. Huh? Isn&#x27;t this even better than the sci-fi movies from the US? The US was trying to stir up trouble, but they ended up losing more than they gained. Hilarious. This alone caused the US to lose 15 satellites.</p>
<p>They must be crying their eyes out during the test. Has everyone noticed? It seems like Bid is still searching for Starlink satellites. Holy crap, it really is. Netzens watched by D&#x27;s flight path. They soon discovered a new continent.</p>
<p>Let them have hope again. Eagle, it was already late at night. However, many foreigners are also watching the live broadcast of the maiden flight of the White Emperor fighter jet from the Great Sea Kingdom after they saw the Starlink satellites destroyed. I felt angry instantly. that damn government.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve made us lose so much money again. Upton is a bastard. He can&#x27;t surpass us technically, so he resorts to these underhanded tactics. Damn it. The great SA kingdom has made breakthroughs in space technology, and instead of trying to catch up, they&#x27;re resorting to such despicable means.</p>
<p>Get Optin off the stage. Angry Americans flooded the White House website with protests. They were fully aware of the entire process. It was the Americans who wanted to cause trouble that led to this outcome. They also gained a deep understanding of the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s technological prowess in the field of space.</p>
<p>If the sneak attack succeeds, perhaps they won&#x27;t say anything. But it was discovered by the Great Sea Kingdom and the losses are so severe. The government must provide an explanation. On the other side, NASA headquarters. Trudeau saw 15 Starlink satellites destroyed.</p>
<p>A chill ran from the soles of my feet straight to the top of my head. The thing I had been worried about had finally come true. It&#x27;s over. I told you we couldn&#x27;t do that. Now look what&#x27;s happened.</p>
<p>15 Starlink satellites are gone. Next, the great SEA Kingdom may retaliate. Dur held his head in his hands, his face full of helplessness and panic. He had already advised Optton against it, but Optton wouldn&#x27;t listen to him. Well, Dur sighed helplessly.</p>
<p>He seemed to have aged several years in an instant. He picked up the phone and reported the bad news to Optinton. White House. the president&#x27;s office. Oftton was extremely tired.</p>
<p>I sat down and rested for a while with my eyes closed. Ring, ring, ring. The ringing of the phone woke him up. I picked it up and saw it was a call from Durit. The call was immediately connected and the question was asked, &quot;Du, did you crash into the great Sea Kingdom Space Blank?&quot; There was a 3-second silence on the other end of the phone, followed by a trembling voice replying, &quot;No, and our Starlink satellites were 15 destroyed.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Optin, who was still a little confused, instantly snapped to attention and shouted, &quot;You&#x27;re saying that another 15 of our satellites have been destroyed.&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; Trudeau gave an affirmative answer.</p>
<p>Upton felt a buzzing sound in his head. It felt like being hit hard by a heavy hammer. I almost bounced off the chair. His eyes widened, his face filled with disbelief and anger, veins bulging on his forehead as he roared. &quot;What exactly is going on? Why were our satellites destroyed again? Did the Great Sea Kingdom use their laser cannons again? As he had envisioned, their Starling satellites simply accidentally collided with the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s space fighters.</p>
<p>Even if the Great Sa Kingdom discovered it, it wouldn&#x27;t have time to hide. It would definitely be able to destroy their space planes. At that time, even if the Great Sa Kingdom wanted to retaliate, it would have to think twice. But now, Mr. President, it&#x27;s a laser cannon, but an airborne laser cannon.</p>
<p>Optin found this explanation even more unacceptable. You&#x27;re saying their space fighters are also equipped with laser cannons. That&#x27;s right. Pulen was completely exasperated, his anger bordering on impotence. Damn it.</p>
<p>How did they do that? Suddenly, he thought of something and hurriedly said, &quot;Quickly, get our other Starlink satellites away from the Great Sea Kingdoms space fighters.&quot; This moment, he finally realized what fear was. The Great Sea Kingdom is truly willing to take direct action. Unlike before, there&#x27;s no longer condemnation. It&#x27;s a pity his realization came too late. Chapter 95.</p>
<p>The White Emperor Space Fighters went berserk. NASA Space Agency. After Trudeau hung up the phone, immediately issue the order. Quickly, adjust our Starlink satellites to another orbit. Aerospace fighters far away from the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Immediately, right now. Yes. The staff member, sweating profusely, immediately began the operation. Durit was filled with apprehension. Hopefully, it&#x27;s not too late.</p>
<p>Great SEA Kingdom, you must be kind. You&#x27;ve destroyed 15 of our satellites. That should appease you. He could only pray silently in his heart. After the Great Sea Kingdom destroys those 15 satellites, they stop thinking about dealing with their other satellites.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if it were the former Great Sea Kingdom, perhaps it really is as he thought. But now, the Great Sea Kingdom has Lin Shun, this conservative. His plan was destined to fail. On the other side, the prime minister&#x27;s residence in the land of cherry blossoms. Your excellency, 15 of America&#x27;s satellites have been destroyed by the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Are we still going to pay our respects at the Yasakuni Shrine at noon? Defense Minister Taro Yamamoto asked cautiously. The Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s aerospace fighter jets have now been successfully developed. It&#x27;s too late to provoke the Great Sia Kingdom now. What if the Great Sia Kingdom retaliates in anger? How did they resist? But Prime Minister Jiro Kishida wouldn&#x27;t listen at all. Baka Yamamoto Kuan, are you afraid of the Great Sia Kingdom? So what if Great Sia destroys America&#x27;s satellites? We&#x27;re just doing what we want to do in our own country.</p>
<p>If the Great Sa Kingdom dares to attack us, it will be declaring war on us. Do they dare? He simply did not believe that the Great Sia Kingdom would dare to do such a thing. Attacking another country without cause is tantamount to waging war without a declaration of war. in accordance with the consistent practices of the great Sia kingdom. At most, we&#x27;ll just condemn them.</p>
<p>In the end, it all fizzled out. But Taro Yamamoto wanted to explain further. But seeing Kishida Jiro&#x27;s angry eyes, he swallowed back the words he was about to say. But he was still worried. The great Sia Kingdom of today is no longer the great Sia Kingdom of the past.</p>
<p>They even dared to destroy their fleet directly. The US also shot down its sixth generation fighter jets and satellites. The Indian soldiers were also wiped out. What else would the Great Sia Kingdom not dare to do? If they remain passive, the Great Sia Kingdom might not hold a grudge for the time being. But if they jump around too much, constantly provoking the Great Sa Kingdom, settle old scores with the Sakura Kingdom.</p>
<p>By then, their Sakura Kingdom will truly be finished. Despite Japan&#x27;s military strength ranking fifth in the world, it&#x27;s not as impressive as it seems. But the Great Sa Kingdom really wanted to deal with them. Estimate. Just thinking about it sends chills down Yamamoto Taro&#x27;s spine.</p>
<p>May Amitarasu Amakami blessed the great Sia kingdom with goodness. He could only pray in his heart. Kishidajiro remained in a state of madness. Let&#x27;s go and get ready. When the time for the sacrificial ceremony arrives, we will begin our worship.</p>
<p>In space, Lu X Yaoyang has gone on a killing spree. In less than 10 minutes, it destroyed more than 1,000 Starlink satellites. as long as it is within the radar lock-on range. They were all destroyed. Bite aerospace fighter jet.</p>
<p>Inside the cockpit, Luos Xiaoyang looked excited. Haha, that was awesome. He had never had such extensive live fire training before. It was conducted in space. It was absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Previous training sessions never included such a large-scale combat scenario. This was simply an exhilarating space spectacle. He glanced at the remaining battery power. They then contacted the ground command center. calling the command center.</p>
<p>1,000 Starlink satellites have been destroyed. The energy level has dropped to 60%. Should we continue? Ground command center. All the engineers were excited. It was so much fun to watch.</p>
<p>Even General and Commander Lu were the same. After hearing Luo Xiaoys request, all the engineers looked at Lin Chun. Lynch nodded slightly and gave the instructions. Let him begin his return journey as planned. At the same time, we announced the successful maiden flight.</p>
<p>And in the live broadcast, the following scenes are not suitable for viewing. Okay. The engineer decided instantly. Immediately relay the order to Lu Xiaoyang. At the same time, the live stream was announced to be over.</p>
<p>The audience who were initially excited were now in a state of shock. He seemed reluctant to end the live stream. Wow, I was really getting into it and it&#x27;s over already. That was so exhilarating. After this, our great Sia Kingdom will take off.</p>
<p>Huh. I just want to ask if the US feels the pinch from losing so many Starling satellites. Awesome. This spring festival gift from the government is fantastic. All the people were filled with pride.</p>
<p>Launch a devastating attack on the United States and the US can only keep quiet about it. This feeling is incredibly exhilarating. The feeling of frustration from being bullied by the US before. After this, it will never exist again. Especially the veterans.</p>
<p>Seeing how powerful our country is today, I was so excited that tears welled up in my eyes. They remembered the battlefield. Faced with the equipment advantages of powerful countries like the United States. We could only fight with our own flesh and blood. And it was only through the sacrifice of countless comrades that we achieved the peace we enjoy today.</p>
<p>Now the country now possesses such advanced aerospace fighters. It can easily deliver a devastating blow to the United States. Those comrades who sacrificed their lives if they could know this in the afterlife would rest in peace. The live stream has ended, but the online buzz didn&#x27;t decrease. Instead, it skyrocketed.</p>
<p>The top 100 trending topics on all online platforms are about the maiden flight of the white emperor. Any edited clips will go viral as soon as they are posted online. At the same time, many ordinary people also spontaneously went to the martyr cemetery to lay flowers and pay their respects. Inform our martyrs of the glory and power of the great Sia kingdom today. The entire Great Sea Kingdom was in a state of jubilation.</p>
<p>The capital city testing center chief engineer Lynn, are you preparing to take action against Japan? After seeing Linshin&#x27;s arrangements, General Jeang asked a question based on his guess. That&#x27;s right. Lynshin nodded emphatically, a cold glint in his eyes. Destroying the USS Starling satellites was just a side effect. His goal for this maiden flight was to bomb the Japanese devil&#x27;s latrines.</p>
<p>As for what consequences this will cause, he&#x27;s really not afraid. It would be best if the Japanese fiercely resisted. That would give us an excuse to wipe them out. Even if they don&#x27;t resist now, I&#x27;ll find a chance to ride a horse through the cherry blossoms in the future. Upon hearing this, General Jeang became even more excited.</p>
<p>Really? That&#x27;s wonderful. Commander Lu chimed in. I can&#x27;t wait to see how the Japanese will react when they see their latrine has been bombed. Lie Jian Guo stood aside, his eyes filled with excitement and anticipation. Shaolin, you&#x27;re awesome.</p>
<p>He gave Lin Chin a thumbs up, a big thumbs up in support. Whether it&#x27;s destroying thousands of US satellites, they&#x27;ll still come down and bomb the haunted toilet. He expressed his support, things they wanted to do but couldn&#x27;t do before, Lynch has finally achieved it. While Lin Chun and the others were talking in space, after the White Emperor Aerospace fighters located the coordinates of the airspace of Japan, they found the coordinates of the airspace of Japan. Then they began their return to the interior of Earth.</p>
<p>Chapter 96. Bombing the ghost toilet in Yasakone. Eagle NASA space agency watching as Starlink satellites are continuously destroyed. Durret turned pale and collapsed to the ground. He kept muttering, &quot;It&#x27;s over.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s completely over. This bureau chief position has reached its end. He never dreamed of this. One day, the US will also be beaten down by others and won&#x27;t dare to fight back. It&#x27;s still unknown when the great SIA kingdom will back down.</p>
<p>If this continues, 8,000 Starlink satellites belonging to the US are about to be destroyed. At that time, use Starlink to build a future Star Shield will be thwarted. To deploy space-based weapons on Starlink satellites will also be scrapped. All these plans will therefore fall apart. Trudeau is well aware of the importance of the Starlink satellite project to the future of the United States.</p>
<p>But President Opton wouldn&#x27;t listen to advice. Just when Durit was in despair, a technician reported with a hint of excitement. Chief, it seems the attack from the Great Sea Kingdom has stopped. Their live stream has been turned off. It seems the maiden flight has ended.</p>
<p>Really? Dur jumped up instantly. Go check out the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s live stream right away. It has been found to be closed. I immediately got excited. Haha, great.</p>
<p>We finally made it through. Durret immediately shouted excitedly. It&#x27;s like the feeling of surviving a disaster. Quickly calculate the final losses. After the initial excitement, Trudeau immediately tallied the losses.</p>
<p>Soon the results will come out. Chief, a total of 1,5 satellites have been lost. 1,5 pieces? How can there be so many? It&#x27;s only been 10 minutes, hasn&#x27;t it? Dur&#x27;s smile vanished instantly. He thought it was only a couple hundred. I didn&#x27;t expect it to exceed a thousand.</p>
<p>This loss left him feeling extremely heartbroken and shocked. Those are 1,5 meticulously crafted Starlink satellites. It was destroyed in just over 10 minutes. The technician looking dejected replied, &quot;Director, it&#x27;s true. We&#x27;ve checked several times and it&#x27;s always this number.&quot; Dur fell silent.</p>
<p>A long time. He sighed. Well, 1,000 it is. It&#x27;s better than being completely destroyed. He calmed himself down.</p>
<p>He then reported this news to President Oppen. White House, the president&#x27;s office. After listening to Durit&#x27;s report, Optton, it was as if his soul had been ripped out. He sat there blankly in the chair. It was as if he had been subjected to some major shock.</p>
<p>My mind went blank for a moment. A moment later, Optton suddenly flew into a rage. Destroy a thousand of my Starlink satellites. Damn great Sia Kingdom. How dare you? Oh, he cursed as he frantically smashed everything on his desk.</p>
<p>This is a way to vent extreme anger and resentment. Documents, pin holders, picture frames, and other items on the desk were thrown around, leaving the entire office in a mess. The secretary and staff stood outside the door, listened to the roars and the sounds of things breaking coming from inside. They looked at each other, not daring to utter a sound, fearing that innocent bystanders might be affected. A while later, Opton gradually stopped throwing and smashing things because the table was already empty.</p>
<p>He braced himself on the desk with both hands, panting heavily. The feeling was like the exhaustion after a strenuous workout. Great Sea Kingdom, you just wait. I will settle this score with you, he said through gritted teeth. OPT then tried to calm himself down.</p>
<p>They began to think about how to take revenge on the great Sea Kingdom. On the other side, Tesla headquarters. Musk has learned that more than a thousand of his Starlink satellites have been destroyed.  those bastards in the government are using my Starlink satellites to do these shady things again. You bastard.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve caused me such heavy losses. He was filled with anger, but there was nothing they could do. He no longer has control of Starlink. The starship had only been destroyed not long ago. Now the Starlink satellites have been destroyed.</p>
<p>In addition, his car business was also hampered. The original plan to build a production workshop in the Great Sa Kingdom was also ruined because of the falling out between the United States and the Great Sa Kingdom. At this rate, he&#x27;ll soon be on the bankruptcy table. No, I can&#x27;t give up. I&#x27;m going to keep fooling people.&quot; Musk rallied his spirits and began contacting those capitalists.</p>
<p>There are also high-tech companies in the United States. I hope they will invest. However, he did not contact Pingua because Pingua has now completely declined, especially after being tricked by the great Sia Kingdom once. Cook was fired by the shareholders meeting. Pingua&#x27;s market value has shrunk by several tens of times.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s even worse off than his own company, Tesla. The US is furious because Starlink satellites have been destroyed. On the other side, the land of cherry blossoms, the Yasakuni haunted toilet. The atmosphere at this time was as lively as a temple fair during the lunar new year. The ghost toilet little bastards could be seen gathering everywhere.</p>
<p>Yash. The collective worship ceremony is about to begin. Kishida&#x27;s hand is already here. We must support him this time. So what if the great Sia Kingdom space fighter jet successfully completed its maiden flight? They still have to be at our mercy.</p>
<p>The little bastards around them were all smug and arrogant. Inside are their religious artifacts. It can be said to be their spiritual nourishment. If the ghost toilet is destroyed, over 90% of the little bastards in the entire Sakura country will have their faith collapse. This could lead to a mental breakdown, but they knew that this was impossible.</p>
<p>The Yasakuni Go&#x27;s toilet were indeed attacked. That means the entire capital of the Sakura Kingdom may have already fallen. The entire haunted toilet covers an area of 100,000 square meters. Self-defense forces patrol the area regularly. It&#x27;s to prevent accidents from happening.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the haunted toilet, Jurro Kishida has arrived here. NHK Japan s largest television network was also broadcasting it live. Kishida Jurro checked the time. Then facing the live stream camera, he flashed his signature fake smile and said, &quot;Dear viewers, we have gathered here today to witness this sacred moment together. The Yasakuni shrine is a symbol of our spirit.</p>
<p>Next, on behalf of the people of the whole country, I will pay tribute to the heroic souls. He was speaking. I stepped into the haunted toilet. The surrounding little bastards cheered. Support the prime minister.</p>
<p>Long live Tian Wong. Long live the great cherry blossom empire. At this moment, the toilet was filled with incense smoke, and the little bastards followed Kisha Jiro into the toilet. But they didn&#x27;t know the mighty aerospace fighter jets have landed 5,000 m above them. Due to its powerful stealth capabilities, no air defense radars or military satellites in the entire country of Japan detected anything on the bitey aerospace fighter jet.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang stared at the 3D visual radar screen, his eyes filled with hatred. He couldn&#x27;t wait any longer and immediately contacted the command center. Command center, I have landed at the target location. Request immediate bombing. Command center received.</p>
<p>Permission granted to drop bombs. Receive. Chapter 97. The ghost toilet disappears. Lu Xiaoyang took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Start setting the detailed coordinates for the quantum annihilation bombs deployment. The entire Yasakuni ghost toilet covers a total area of 100,000 square m. The power of a single quantum annihilation bomb is just enough to cover 10,000 m. Only 10 are needed. That would make the entire Yasukuni ghost toilet disappear from the world.</p>
<p>Coordinate set. Please drop the bomb. White Emperor voice prompt. Luos X Yaoyong did not hesitate. Press the bomb preparation button directly.</p>
<p>Moment. The fighter jet&#x27;s belly hatch slowly opened. Inside the basketball-sized quantum annihilation bombs, gleaming with a dark luster, were neatly arranged. You little devils, you&#x27;re going to die. He sneered inwardly and pressed the bomb release button.</p>
<p>An annihilation bomb hurdled down, tearing through the sky. It plummeted rapidly towards the ghost toilet below, so fast that it was just a blur. Then he dropped the remaining eight quantum annihilation bombs. Each time the button is pressed, one of the annihilation bombs detached from the fuselof. 10 bombs were like precise arrows towards the preset coordinates of the Yasakuni ghost toilet location.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang stared at the radar screen, watching the quantum annihilation bomb fall wildly. His expression grew increasingly agitated and eventually his face turned red. Great grandfather, may your spirit rest in peace. Rest in peace, martyrs. Today the motherland has avenged you.</p>
<p>No one knew that he was hiding a secret. His greatgrandfather had also participated in the war of resistance against Japan. He died at the hands of the Japanese devils. Today he pilots the most advanced fighter jet in his country. We must make this spiritual sanctuary of executioners disappear completely.</p>
<p>Ground the Yasakuni ghost toilet. Kishaurro filled with excitement led the way into the Yasakuni ghost toilet. He had just stepped into the haunted toilet. A fake smile still on his face. Bastards around cheered wildly.</p>
<p>Long live the prime minister. Long live the great cherry blossom empire. May the bamboo flourish forever. The little bastards around them went completely crazy. Some people even knelt on the ground and cowed out towards the inside of the haunted toilet.</p>
<p>NHK&#x27;s live broadcast camera followed Kishida Jiro closely. He opened his arms wide towards the camera, his voice booming. Today, we commemorate our heroes. No matter how strong the great Sia Kingdom is, it wouldn&#x27;t dare to touch our spiritual symbol. The words had barely left his mouth.</p>
<p>An even louder cheer erupted from the crowd. Sudden of the haunted toilet, a blinding white light exploded. Boom! The loud noise shook the ground violently. Immediately afterwards, the main hall where the memorial tablets were enshrined in the Yasakuni shrine disappeared. There was no smoke, no flames.</p>
<p>All that remains is a giant deep pit measuring 10,000 square me. This sudden scene, Kishidiro s face instantly froze. His pupils shrank suddenly and he looked completely stunned. All the Japanese soldiers around were stunned. They were stunned and dumbfounded as if they had witnessed some kind of miracle.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, Kishidiro snapped out of his days and rubbed his eyes. Realizing that everything before him was real, he screamed in terror. What? What&#x27;s going on? Where is our main temple? Where are our heroic spirits? The sight of the main hall is now just a smooth, large pit. The buildings that once stood there seemed to have been erased from thin air. He couldn&#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>What a magnificent hall. It just disappeared suddenly. Even if it gets bombed, there will probably be some debris left behind. But nothing was left behind. All that&#x27;s left is a deep pit.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still so smooth for the haunted toilet along with all the staff members have disappeared. At the same time, the little bastards around them also came to their senses. Their eyes were filled with fear and disbelief. Baka, can someone tell me this is true? Why did this happen? Was it an attack? Or if it was an air raid, why didn&#x27;t the air raid siren sound? Many little bastards looked up at the sky. They wanted to see if anyone was going to attack them by air.</p>
<p>However, the White Emperor Aerospace fighter jet has visual stealth capabilities. Even at an altitude of 5,000 m above them, they couldn&#x27;t see them. Without visual camouflage, this distance is visible to the naked eye on the ground. It may have a super stealth coating. Little Baka definitely can&#x27;t see it.</p>
<p>while Kisha Deajiro and the others were still in a days. Immediately afterwards, the second quantum annihilation bomb has landed. Boom! A terrifying white light exploded. Another building disappeared in the energy wave. The Japanese staff inside finally came to their senses.</p>
<p>&quot;Run! We&#x27;ve been attacked by air.&quot; They took off running. Even Kishida Jiro, who was standing at the door, came to his senses. He roared at the bodyguard in terror. &quot;Quickly, get me out of here.&quot; His legs were so weak with fear that he couldn&#x27;t walk at all. The bodyguards grabbed him and rushed him frantically outside.</p>
<p>At this time, the little bastard kneeling on the ground outside also came to his senses. They were filled with panic and scrambled to escape in all directions. Some were pushed to the ground and trampled by the crowd. Some panicked and ran into broken walls. Some were so frightened they collapsed to the ground, losing control of their bladder and bowels.</p>
<p>At the same time, the quantum annihilation bombs followed one after another. Eight more beams of white light lit up in succession. The entire Yasakuni haunted toilet disappeared at a visible speed. Steel forest, statues, memorial halls, everything was reduced to nothing by the power of the quantum annihilation bomb. Some of the Japanese soldiers while running would not forget to look back once.</p>
<p>As a result, they witnessed a scene that they would never forget. Gone. All gone. Disappeared. This is could it be divine punishment? Kishaurro was led by his bodyguards for several hundred meters before they stopped.</p>
<p>Then his face turned pale and he turned to look at the location of the Yasakuni ghost toilet. No, my haunted toilet. My hero Kishajiro let out a desperate roar. The spiritual symbol he was so proud of has completely disappeared. The cries and screams of the little bastards all around rose and fell.</p>
<p>Mom, I want to go home. Who did this? Why is this happening? Is this divine punishment? Fear overwhelmed everyone like a tidal wave. The previous arrogance and excitement turned into extreme panic of the haunted toilet is tantamount to the destruction of their faith. Many of the little bastards collapsed, slumped to the ground, and howled in pain. They couldn&#x27;t accept this fact.</p>
<p>Why was this perfectly good haunted toilet destroyed in such a short time? on the bitey aerospace fighter jet. Lu Xiaoyang looked at the radar screen, wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes, and was filled with excitement. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. The filthy haunted toilet is finally gone.</p>
<p>On the screen, the original location of the haunted toilet is now just a smooth, deep pit. There are no architectural remains, no traces whatsoever, just like there has never been a Yasakuni haunted toilet here. Command center. Mission accomplished. Lu Xiaoyangs voice was full of pride.</p>
<p>Well done. Return to base immediately. Receive. Chapter 98. Little Baka&#x27;s spiritual faith collapses.</p>
<p>Inside the cockpit, Lu Xiaoyang looked in the direction of the great Sia Kingdom. A determined light shone in his eyes. At this moment, he felt an unprecedented surge of pride and ambition. I&#x27;m home. He spoke softly into the communicator.</p>
<p>His voice, however, betrayed an irrepressible excitement. Lu Xiaoyang immediately issued the order to return to base. Body&#x27;s aerospace fighter jets broke through the clouds. The silver gray fuselov streaked across the sky. The golden dragon pattern shown brightly in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Siaki testing center. Huh? We&#x27;ve finally gotten rid of that haunted toilet. Yes, that disgusting thing has finally disappeared from this world. The white emperor is truly remarkable. The Japanese devils never even noticed his existence.</p>
<p>Every engineer&#x27;s face was filled with excitement. Some even wept with joy to be able to destroy the Japanese Yasakuni shrine in full view of everyone. This is sufficient proof of the White Emperor&#x27;s powerful stealth capabilities and terrifying combat abilities. This is not only a technological breakthrough, but also a powerful response to historical trauma. General Jeang secretly wiped away a tear of emotion from the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Good, good, good,&quot; he said. Good three times in a row. Everything is understood without words. As soldiers, they understand the deepest hatred for the haunted toilets. The haunted toilet disappeared.</p>
<p>A thorn had been pulled out of my heart, bringing me great comfort. Saying that, he suddenly turned around and hugged Commander Lou, who was standing next to him. He patted the other man&#x27;s back hard. Old Lu, did you see that? We finally leveled out the Japanese devil&#x27;s lousy latrine. Commander Lu was so breathless from General Ciangs embrace that he didn&#x27;t push him away.</p>
<p>His eyes also welled up with tears and his voice choked with emotion. I saw it. I saw it. The spirits of our martyrs can finally rest in peace. So many years.</p>
<p>The great Sia Kingdom finally succeeded. Lie Jian Guo stood to the side, his eyes filled with excitement. He looked at Lynshin beside him, his voice trembling. Kobayashi, we we really did it. As he spoke, he raised his hand and wiped the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>Lynchin smiled and nodded. Mr. This is just the beginning. This time, we&#x27;re just collecting some interest from the Japanese devils. They&#x27;ll suffer again someday.</p>
<p>His tone was calm, yet carried an undeniable authority. This time, it was just a shack toilet that got blown up. How could we let them go so easily? He&#x27;s waiting. When the great Sia Kingdom is completely invincible on Earth, it&#x27;s time to settle the score. A country that once bullied the Great Sea Kingdom, none of them can escape after this incident.</p>
<p>In the short term, no country will dare to provoke great Sia again. The Great Sia Kingdom will then have enough time to develop. By the time those countries realize what&#x27;s happening, the Great Sa Kingdom has become powerful enough to crush all other nations on the entire Blue Star. Even if they all unite, it won&#x27;t make a difference. Time flew by amidst Lin Shun and his friends excited cheers.</p>
<p>Soon, the White Emperor fighter jet then returned to the test center. Lyn Shun and General Jeang went out to greet them. The moment Lu Xiaoyang stepped down from BI, &quot;Welcome home, Hero,&quot; General Xang led the cheers. Everyone present shouted in unison. The sound was deafening as if it wanted to spread this joy and pride to every corner.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang stepped off the fighter jet with firm steps. His face beamed with pride and excitement. Although all the credit belongs to the White Emperor, but he also felt incredibly honored. General Jeang strode forward and firmly grasped Luo Xiaoyangs hand. Little Luo, you did a fantastic job.</p>
<p>You are a hero of our great Sia Kingdom. Lu Xiaoyang immediately stood at attention and gave a standard military salute. Sir, this is what I should do. It is my honor to be able to contribute to the country. Furthermore, White Emperor is advanced enough.</p>
<p>I am merely an executive. The real credit goes to the research team and everyone who has worked hard for the great Xia Kingdom. General Jeang patted Luo Xiaoyang on the shoulder. Good. Everyone deserves credit.</p>
<p>You deserve it, too. Next, Lu Xiaoyang was scheduled to undergo a physical examination. Check if there are any problems. Back to the testing center. Lynchin addressed all the chief engineers.</p>
<p>The maiden flight of Bid was a complete success. It&#x27;s all thanks to everyone here. Today is Lunar New Year&#x27;s Eve. You should go back now to reunite with your families. If the distance is far, have General Jean arrange for someone to take you directly to the airport so you can take the nearest direct flight.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a happy Lunar New Year&#x27;s Eve. Thank you, Chief Designer Lynn. All the chief engineers responded enthusiastically. BY has successfully completed its maiden flight. They also want to go back and reunite with their families.</p>
<p>Soon, the engineers left excitedly. General Jean also made corresponding arrangements. Lynshin followed Lie Jang Wuo back to the Xiaku Institute&#x27;s office. Shaolin, come back with me for dinner later. Lie Jian Guo knew that Lyn Shan was an orphan and didn&#x27;t have a girlfriend.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t want to see Lynshan spend the new year alone, so he extended a warm invitation. Lynshan smiled and nodded, a warm feeling welling up in his heart. All right, Mr. Lee, then I&#x27;ll take the time to bother you and your family. He could see the determination in Li Jang Wos eyes.</p>
<p>If he doesn&#x27;t agree, Lie Jian Guo probably won&#x27;t let him off easily, so I stopped being pretentious. Li Jian Guo was stunned for a moment, then said excitedly, &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s go back now.&quot; He had prepared a whole bunch of arguments to persuade Lynch after she refused. As a result, Lynch readily agreed. Then the two left the Seyaku Academy. At the same time, the land of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>Yasakuni haunted toilet. Like a whirlwind, it swept across the entire country. Rascals ran wildly through the streets and alleys, their faces filled with terror. Some people ran and cried, shouting, &quot;Divine punishment. It&#x27;s divine punishment.</p>
<p>Heaven is going to punish our cherry blossom country. How could this happen? Where are our heroic spirits? Our faith is gone.&quot; Well, why are we being punished? Many of the children collapsed upon hearing this devastating news. Their faith is enshrined inside the haunted toilet. Now it has been suddenly erased. This caused their faith to collapse directly.</p>
<p>Some of the Japanese soldiers couldn&#x27;t even accept it. He committed sepuku directly. This situation, it&#x27;s happening all over the cherry blossom country, prime minister&#x27;s office. Jiro Kishida was escorted back to his office by his bodyguards. He slumped in the black leather chair, his face pale and his hair disheveled.</p>
<p>The once impeccable suit was now wrinkled and covered in dust. He stared blankly at the chaotic street outside the window, muttering to himself, &quot;Gone, all gone.&quot; A while later, he took a deep breath. Forcefully suppress your inner fear and anxiety. At the same time, he forced a smile and clenched his fists to motivate himself. Keep it up.</p>
<p>People who smile a lot are always lucky. Little did he know that people with bad luck can&#x27;t laugh. Someone like him who forces a smile is destined to be unlucky for life. Then Kishidajiro contacted Yamamoto. He was instructed to send someone to investigate the specific reasons for the disappearance of the Yasakoni haunted toilet.</p>
<p>No matter who it is, I&#x27;ll make you pay a heavy price. Kishida Jiro said viciously. Then he forced himself to maintain a slight smile. He wants to be a lucky person. Chapter 99.</p>
<p>The best spring festival gift. The land of cherry blossoms. The Yasakuni haunted toilet pit. The pit walls were as smooth as a mirror without a single pebble. Dozens of experts from Japan dressed in white protective suits were squatting by the pit.</p>
<p>holding an explosives detector. He repeatedly scanned the pit walls. But no matter how they scan, no explosive residue was detected on the detector screen. How is that possible? The leading expert, Ichiro Yamada, spoke with a trembling voice. He took off his protective goggles and rubbed his red eyes.</p>
<p>When I put it back on, the screen was still blank. No residual energy from the explosive powder. Not even a trace. How is this possible? Another expert slumped to the ground, his pupils dilated and filled with terror. It was like seeing a ghost.</p>
<p>Yamada Ichiro bent over, staring at the deep pit, his throat bobbing. This isn&#x27;t a bombing nor an explosion. It&#x27;s utter annihilation. Upon hearing this, all the experts around were stunned. Someone suddenly looked up, their eyes filled with fear.</p>
<p>Annihilation? How is that possible? Who on earth has this technology? The Japanese experts around them were all shocked by this conjecture. They are all experts in the field of weapons. I&#x27;ve never seen such an outrageous weapon. It contains no radioactive radiation, yet its power is terrifying. Even a mushroom bomb couldn&#x27;t have such terrifying consequences.</p>
<p>Unless it&#x27;s an extraterrestrial civilization. But is that even possible? Yamada did not answer. He took out his phone and dialed the prime minister&#x27;s office. But his body was trembling. This matter is beyond his control.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s either supernatural or an alien civilization. If you let him choose, he preferred to believe it was a paranormal event. If it&#x27;s an alien civilization, then Earth is in grave danger. At the same time, Yasakuni haunted toilet. It swept across the globe like a tsunami.</p>
<p>The international forum sparked a heated debate among nizens from various countries. An American nizen commented, &quot;My god, Japan&#x27;s spiritual sanctuary is gone. Did aliens do it?&quot; A nizen nicknamed polar bear commented, &quot;Haha, well done. I&#x27;ve disliked that awful toilet for a long time. A netzen from Australia commented, &quot;This is terrifying.</p>
<p>Could it be a new weapon from the Great Sea Kingdom?&quot; A South Korean nizen commented, &quot;It&#x27;s definitely not the Great Sia Kingdom. I suspect it&#x27;s our alien civilization that&#x27;s come looking for us.&quot; Netzens are arguing fiercely, but many more people turned their attention to the Great Sea Kingdom. After all, on the same day, the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s white emperor aerospace fighter had just successfully completed its maiden flight. The Great Sa Kingdom. This is the time when people are having family reunion dinners at home.</p>
<p>Apart from the F3 from South China, everyone was gathered around the TV watching the spring festival gala. When someone spread the news, the people of the great Sea Kingdom could hardly believe it. What? The Yasakuni haunted toilet is gone. Really? Let me see. Many people have started going online to read the news.</p>
<p>When I saw the photos of the Yasakuni shrine, now a deep pit, all the people celebrated again. Holy crap, it&#x27;s real. That&#x27;s so satisfying. Huh? This is the best Chinese New Year gift ever. Damn.</p>
<p>Someone actually went and wiped out the Yasakuni haunted toilet. I suspect it was our bitey aerospace fighters that did it, but I have no evidence. He Everyone understands what&#x27;s going on. Many people guessed what had happened because the timing was too coincidental with the maiden flight of Bid. Large numbers of people began setting off firecrackers and fireworks to celebrate.</p>
<p>We were originally planning to wait until after midnight to celebrate the spring festival, but they couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. There&#x27;s nothing more worth celebrating than this. Even areas where burning was originally prohibited were allowed to be opened for short periods of time. The crackling sounds mixed with cheers filled the night sky of the great Sia Kingdom. A certain residential community veteranly sat at the dining table watching the news report about the deep pit in the Yasakuni Shrine.</p>
<p>Tears suddenly welled up in her cloudy eyes. He raised his glass, trembling, towards the sky. Old buddies, did you see that? Those bastards den is gone. The younger generation at the table should quickly refill the elders wine. Their eyes were also filled with tears.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s rare to see the old man so excited. Similar scenes were happening all over the Great Sa Kingdom. Many veterans were moved to tears upon seeing this scene. The Yasakonei haunted toilet can be considered as fulfilling a long-held wish of theirs. The entire Great Sa Kingdom was paying close attention to this news.</p>
<p>Everyone was holding a mobile phone. I&#x27;m scrolling through news about the disappearance of the haunted toilet. We chat groups. Red envelopes are flooding the screen. Celebrate.</p>
<p>We must celebrate. This year was so much fun. On the internet, the best Chinese New Year gift. The Yasakonei haunted toilet was erased. Topics like these instantly surged to the top of the trending searches.</p>
<p>Its popularity surpassed that of the spring festival gala and all entertainment news. Some are happy, some are sad. During the nationwide celebrations in the great sea kingdom, the eagle far across the Pacific Ocean. It was just dawn. Eagle White House Oval Office.</p>
<p>Upton didn&#x27;t sleep well all night. I didn&#x27;t fall asleep until almost dawn. But just as he fell asleep, &quot;Ring, ring, ring.&quot; The shrill ring of the telephone instantly enraged him. He picked up the phone, saw it was his secretary calling, and answered, &quot;Bower, you&#x27;d better have something important to say, or the consequences will be dire.&quot; On the other end of the phone, a flustered voice came from the secretary or president, something terrible has happened. The Yasakuni goes toilet in Japan has disappeared.</p>
<p>What did you say? Optin, who was still half asleep, instantly woke up and sat up abruptly in bed. What disappeared? The Yasakuni Ghost toilet in Japan has disappeared, completely erased from the map, leaving nothing behind. Upon hearing this, Optton&#x27;s face turned deathly pale. Erase. Nothing was left behind.</p>
<p>Damn it. He suddenly remembered that the White Emperor of the Great Sa Kingdom had destroyed thousands of their Starling satellites. My heart skipped a beat. Quickly convene a military meeting immediately. Have NASA, Department of Defense military experts, and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff assemble at the White House immediately.</p>
<p>Optin&#x27;s voice was filled with an unprecedented panic. He got up immediately and tidied up quickly. They rushed to the White House conference room. On the road, Opton picked up his phone and dialed NASA administrator Trudeau&#x27;s number. Truth: Investigate immediately.</p>
<p>Where did White Emperor go after its maiden flight yesterday? On the other end of the phone, Durit&#x27;s voice sounded sleepy. President White Emperor returned to the Great Sea Kingdoms testing center yesterday. Our satellites have been monitoring it. Staring, Opton roared, what happened to the ghost toilets in Japan? Besides the Great Sea Kingdom, who else has this? Dur trembled at the shout and quickly said, I&#x27;ll go check right away. Right away.</p>
<p>I hung up the phone. Opton was in a very bad mood. If it really is the Great Sa Kingdom, the US&#x27;s aircraft carriers and bases, wouldn&#x27;t it be just like that haunted toilet disappearing without a trace? The more he thought about it, the more panicked he became. Chapter 100. The mad revenge of the cherry blossom country.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the hexagon military conference room. the Secretary of Defense, the Chief of Staff, Five-Star Military Experts, the Chairman of the Joint Conference, NASA Administrator Trudeau, and others were all seated at the table. Everyone&#x27;s face was solemn, especially those military experts. I was very unhappy about being called to a meeting so early in the morning. As the saying goes, people raise cattle and feed horses, but no one understands the true nature of cattle and horses.</p>
<p>This is the cruel reality of society. Optton sat in the main seat, his face grim. Tell me, what exactly happened? Was the ghost toilet incident in Japan caused by the Great Sa Kingdom? Durret pushed up his glasses, his voice trembling. Mr. President, we&#x27;ve investigated.</p>
<p>None of the satellites detected any flying objects over Japan. These words were spoken. The meeting room fell silent instantly. The military experts fell silent. This matter is truly bizarre.</p>
<p>Based on the information available at present, we have no idea what caused it. Just looking at pictures of the accident scene, they couldn&#x27;t think of any weapon that could produce such an effect. The scene, so bizarrely disturbed, could be described as a paranormal event. Defense Secretary Pit looked at the silent military experts and asked in a deep voice, &quot;If we are attacked like this, is there any way to prevent it?&quot; The five-star military experts exchanged glances and shook their heads. a military expert said helplessly, &quot;We can&#x27;t guarantee that either.</p>
<p>It would be best to wait until Japan finds out the specific details before we see if there are any counter measures.&quot; The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his face Ashen asked, &quot;If that&#x27;s the case, then isn&#x27;t our homeland also unsafe?&quot; OPT rubbed his temples and took a deep breath. Regardless of whether it was done by the Great Sa Kingdom or not, we must be prepared. Let the Pacific fleet approach the waters of Japan, but do not provoke them. Strengthen domestic air defense and missile defense systems, especially defense against aerospace targets. Contact the Kingdom of Sakura.</p>
<p>Tell them not to act rashly and not to cause trouble for the great SA kingdom. He paused, then added. Furthermore, have the intelligence department investigate the true capabilities of White Emperor at all costs. Laser weapon development is accelerating and sixth generation fighter jets are entering mass production directly. Starship&#x27;s second test flight accelerates.</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. No one dared to underestimate the great Sia Kingdom anymore. Such supernatural events have occurred in the land of cherry blossoms. It was beyond their comprehension. In the conference room, everyone carries a weight in their heart.</p>
<p>They knew that if they couldn&#x27;t find a solution, their era of American hijgemony may be coming to an end. The next day, the prime minister&#x27;s residence in the land of cherry blossoms. Jiro Kishida sat in his office looking at the experts investigation report. His hands were clenched into fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white. Annihilation.</p>
<p>Could it be the great Sia Kingdom? He suddenly remembered the jokes made by netzens from the great Sia Kingdom the day before when white emperor made its maiden flight. Should we send a Chinese New Year gift to Japan? At the time, he found it laughable. Looking back now, it wasn&#x27;t a joke at all. It&#x27;s a warning. It&#x27;s a heads up.</p>
<p>Baka, great Sia Kingdom. It must have been done by the great Sia Kingdom. Kisha Jurro slammed his hand on the table and the teacup on the table crashed to the ground. Fragments flew everywhere and tea soaked his suit trousers. The secretary rushed in, saw this scene, and quickly bowed.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, President Oppen of the US is calling you. Kishaurro took a deep breath and tidied his messy hair. Catch. The call connected and Optin&#x27;s voice came through. Kishida, calm down.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t cause trouble for the great Sia Kingdom. Jiro Kishida gritted his teeth. President Opton, our spiritual sanctuary is gone. We can&#x27;t just let this go. Forget it.</p>
<p>Optton sneered. How do you plan to settle it? With your Shinshin fighter jets or with your self-defense forces? The White Emperor of the Great Sea Kingdom can destroy thousands of satellites. Going to them is just suicide. Jiro Kishida was speechless after being rebuked. He knew that Upton was telling the truth, but the anger in my heart was impossible to suppress.</p>
<p>So, so we just accept it like this. Upton paused for a few seconds, then said, &quot;Investigate first. We&#x27;ll make plans after we find out the details of White Emperor. Let&#x27;s not make any rash decisions yet. Let&#x27;s wait for our technological breakthrough.&quot; All right.</p>
<p>After hanging up the phone, Kishida Jiro slumped into a chair. He looked out the window at the chaotic streets. The little bastards are still crying and protesting. But he knew none of that would help. The great Sia Kingdom is no longer the country that can be bullied at will, even if they guess that it was the great Sia Kingdom that did it.</p>
<p>But they had no real evidence. So it was all for nothing. Now the only way to find a breakthrough is to look for other solutions. Japan also has its trump cards. However, it cannot be used unless the country is destroyed.</p>
<p>But he couldn&#x27;t swallow his anger. Kishidajiro remained silent for a moment. Suddenly, a brilliant idea struck him a way to discuss the great Sia Kingdom. Secretary, go and summon the Minister of the Interior. Not long after, the Minister of the Interior was summoned.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, what are your orders? Kisha Jiro said in a deep voice. Issue an announcement immediately. Discharge nuclear wastewater in 5 days. If the Great Sa Kingdom won&#x27;t let us have an easy time, then the whole world won&#x27;t have an easy time either. this.</p>
<p>The minister of the interior was sweating profusely. Prime Minister, if we really do this, we will become the enemy of the entire planet. You don&#x27;t need to worry about it. All you need to do is execute the command. Jiro Kishida didn&#x27;t care about any of that.</p>
<p>He was so angry he couldn&#x27;t let it out. Seeing this, the minister of the interior had no choice but to leave, but he also had a sense of unease in his heart. If the great Sa Kingdom takes strong countermeasures as a result, then Japan would truly be plunged into an abyss of no return. But at this moment, Kishiduro was blinded by rage and wouldn&#x27;t listen to any advice. The Minister of the Interior had no choice but to bite the bullet and arrange the relevant matters.</p>
<p>Soon, Japan would be discharging nuclear waste water in 5 days spread throughout the world. Countries around the world expressed shock and condemnation. We demand that Japan immediately cease this outrageous behavior, especially South Korea. They are closest to the waters of Japan. They are well aware of the enormous threat that the discharge of nuclear waste water poses to their own marine environment and fishery resources.</p>
<p>They immediately jumped out to strongly oppose it. We solemnly warned Japan not to discharge nuclear waste water, otherwise we will take the strongest counter measures. I hope Japan doesn&#x27;t make a mistake. Warning from South Korea. Japan has not responded.</p>
<p>Many countries are waiting to see how the Great Sea Congress will respond. After all, the Great Sa Kingdom and the Cherry Blossom Kingdom are very close to each other. Chapter 101. The conservatives in the Great Sa Kingdom make a scene. The first day of the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Lie Jian&#x27;s home. A variety of dishes were laid out on the table. The sauce from the brazed fish clung to the edge of the plate, and the dumpling wrappers were piled up like a small mountain. Shaolin, we don&#x27;t have much food at home. Please don&#x27;t be shy.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo greeted him warmly. Lyn Shin smiled slightly, looking at the table full of delicious food. A warm feeling welled up in his heart. Mr. Lee, you&#x27;re too kind.</p>
<p>Last night, I had New Year&#x27;s Eve dinner at Mr. Lee&#x27;s house. He deeply appreciated the warmth of the New Year&#x27;s Eve dinner. It also gave him the idea of starting a family, but the thought that his country had not yet dominated the planet made him dismiss that idea. Currently, his focus remains on developing the country&#x27;s science and technology.</p>
<p>Personal feelings and family matters can wait until the nation ventures beyond Earth and embarks on interstellar travel. Then they began to eat. Not long after, everyone is full. Lynchin was just about to take one last sip of the sweet soup. Suddenly, I heard a news broadcast.</p>
<p>Breaking news. Japan will be discharging nuclear waste water in 5 days. Lie Jang Wos expression immediately turned serious. Are those Japanese devils crazy? Aren&#x27;t they endangering the whole of East Asia? Lie Jang Wos 8-year-old granddaughter, Lee, shouting, blinked her eyes as she held the red envelope given to her by Lin Chun. Uncle Lynn, what is nuclear wastewater? Will it kill the little fish? Lynch paused, his hand still holding the soup.</p>
<p>The warmth of the porcelain bowl pressed against his palm, but the temperature in his eyes instantly turned cold. He didn&#x27;t say anything, but took out his phone and checked the news online. Japan will release nuclear wastewater 5 days later. Immediately became a trending topic. Below the trending topic were filled with angry remarks from the people of the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>Holy crap are those Japanese trying to pollute the entire ocean. They deserve to die. They&#x27;re going to destroy the ocean environment of our planet. Those despicable Japanese devils should never exist in this world. Lynshin turned off his phone, a warm smile appearing on his face.</p>
<p>The little fish won&#x27;t die. Anyone who dares to pollute the ocean will die. The little girlly shouting clapped her hands and cheered. Yay! I know Uncle Lynn is the best. Lynshin smiled and pattedly shouting s hair, his eyes full of affection.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, Tinking. No one can pollute our blue sky and clear sea. Then he looked at Lie Jian Guo and said, &quot;Mr. Lee, I&#x27;m going back now.&quot; Lie Jian Guo nodded in agreement. I&#x27;ll go back with you.</p>
<p>Then Lynchin said goodbye to Lie Jians family. Then the two left and returned to the Siaku Academy. Half an hour later, Lie Jang Wos office. Kobayashi, do you have some kind of plan? Lynch nodded. Since the Japanese are so eager to discharge nuclear waste water, then let&#x27;s just annihilate all their nuclear power plants and thermal power plants.</p>
<p>What? Li Jian Guo was shocked by Lynch&#x27;s words. You&#x27;re going to take action against the Japanese power system? He thought Lynchin just wanted to deal with the Japanese&#x27;s black wastewater area. Unexpectedly, Lynchin&#x27;s plan was to destroy all of the Japanese nuclear power plants. That&#x27;s right. This time, we must teach those Japanese devils a lesson they won&#x27;t forget, so that the Japanese devils won&#x27;t cause any more trouble next time.</p>
<p>Lynchin&#x27;s idea was very simple. Repeating their old tricks whenever they face any threat. Let&#x27;s teach those Japanese devils a lesson they won&#x27;t forget. If it&#x27;s just about erasing the Japanese nuclear power plants, who knows, we might even do them a big favor. He certainly couldn&#x27;t let the Japanese get away with it.</p>
<p>All right, Lie Jian Guo didn&#x27;t object. Those damn Japanese are courting death. They really need to be taught a lesson. Smoothing over the Yasakuni shrine didn&#x27;t calm the Japanese down. It is clear that their inherent flaws have never changed.</p>
<p>Since they are determined to rush headlong down the path of self-destruction, then let them pay a heavy price. Just then, Lynchin&#x27;s phone rang. It was General Cenangs phone call. Kobayashi, did you see the announcement? That little Japanese devil is asking for it. The voice on the phone was filled with anger.</p>
<p>Lynchin calmly replied, &quot;General Jang, I have a plan. Would you like to come to the Sia Academy of Sciences?&quot; &quot;You have a plan?&quot; General Jang asked in surprise, then replied excitedly. &quot;Great. I&#x27;ll go to the Sia Academy of Sciences right away to discuss it with you.&quot; 20 minutes later, the door to Li Jang Wos office was pushed open. General Jeang rushed in.</p>
<p>Before even sitting down, he eagerly asked, &quot;Shaolin, what are your plans?&quot; Lynshan explained calmly, &quot;Sen by Directly, blow up all the nuclear and thermal power plants in Japan.&quot; Hiss. Upon hearing this, General Jeang gasped, &quot;This is no plan. It&#x27;s clearly about to unleash a massive earthshattering storm. Nuclear and thermal power plants account for 50% of the Japanese people&#x27;s electricity generation. Once they are all destroyed, the entire Sakura parliament was hit by a power shortage.</p>
<p>This will lead to a series of consequences. General Jeang steadied himself, his eyes revealing a complex mix of semnity and excitement. Kobayashi, while this plan is satisfying, it is extremely difficult to implement and its international impact is immeasurable. Also, can it really annihilate those nuclear power plants? What if the nuclear wastewater storage tanks explode? No, Lynchin said confidently. The quantum annihilation bomb will annihilate all matter.</p>
<p>It will only leave the nuclear radiation in place. Then he upon hearing this, General Ciangs eyes immediately lit up. Kobayashi, are you sure the nuclear radiation will remain? Confirmed. Lynchin nodded emphatically. All right, I agree to your plan, General said without further hesitation.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll apply to the higher-ups right away. After saying that, General Jeang went out to contact his superiors. General Jeang returns soon after. Shaolin, the higher-ups have approved it. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will give them a warning first.</p>
<p>If they insist on going their own way, then proceed with your plan. Lynch nodded slightly. Can a warning must be given. If those Japanese devils are courting death, then they shouldn&#x27;t blame us. Soon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Great Sea Kingdom officially issued a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement was strongly worded. If Japan insists on discharging nuclear waste water, China will take all necessary measures to retaliate and will not tolerate it. Once the announcement was released, this immediately caused a stir among the people of the great Sea Kingdom. Haha. I knew the country would retaliate.</p>
<p>You little devils tremble. Go ahead and discharge the pollutants if you dare. If you don&#x27;t, I&#x27;m your grandson. You little devils, don&#x27;t back down. You must fight to the bitter end.</p>
<p>Almost all the people of the great Sia Kingdom hoped that the Japanese devils would fight to the bitter end this time. This is why the government has an excuse to deal with them. They were all conservatives who wanted to see the Japanese suffer a terrible defeat. At the same time, the announcement from the Great Sea Kingdom caused a huge uproar internationally. Media outlets around the world widely reported on the story, causing a public uproar.</p>
<p>Yay! The Great Sea Kingdom has finally responded. Japan probably won&#x27;t dare to discharge nuclear wastewater this time. The Great Sia Kingdom has truly grown powerful. They even dare to openly threaten us. Looking forward to Japan&#x27;s response.</p>
<p>There are also many people internationally who enjoy watching the drama unfold. They also wanted to see if the Sakura Kingdom would confront the great Sia Kingdom head-on this time. After all, not long ago, the Kingdom of Sakura had more than a dozen warships destroyed by the Kingdom of Sya. This grudge is Japan&#x27;s policy of restraint or chapter 102 the land of cherry blossoms will never surrender the white house oval office. Optton stared at the announcement from the ministry of foreign affairs of the great sia kingdom on the screen.</p>
<p>He slammed his fist on the table. A bunch of incompetent teammates. Call Kisha Jiro immediately. Tell him to stop right now. No wonder people say that no matter how hard your opponent tries, it&#x27;s not as good as a clever idea from a useless teammate.</p>
<p>They knew perfectly well how terrifyingly powerful the Great Sia Kingdom was now. They even resorted to such tactics to provoke the Great Sia Kingdom. Isn&#x27;t it just asking for trouble? If this continues, it might even affect the US military presence in Japan. We must stop that idiot. Kishida, the call was answered quickly.</p>
<p>OPT roared in fury. Kishida, are you crazy doing something like this at a time like this? Are you trying to get the great Sia Kingdom to declare war on you? The people outside are all from the great Sia Kingdom. Stop right now. Do you hear me? The prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan. Kishida Jiurro, gripping the phone, his face flushed a deep purplish red, retorted defiantly.</p>
<p>President OPT. We are simply discharging nuclear waste water in a legal and compliant manner. What right does the Great Sea Kingdom have to interfere? On what grounds? Optin sneered. On the grounds they have laser cannons. On the grounds they have space fighters.</p>
<p>Is that enough? If you continue to be stubborn, no one can save you. After saying that, Opton hung up the phone immediately. All the advice that needed to be given has already been given. Whether Kishida listens or not is his own business. Then Optin then issued another major order.</p>
<p>Make sure the troops stationed in Japan are ready to withdraw at any time. The prime minister&#x27;s residence in the land of cherry blossoms. Kishaurro heard a busy tone coming from the microphone. He threw the phone aside angrily and said, &quot;Baka, the US is a coward.&quot; The great SEA Kingdom thinks it can scare me. No way.</p>
<p>He summoned the Minister of the Interior, his eyes gleaming with madness. Pass down the order. The nuclear wastewater discharge plan remains unchanged. We&#x27;re deploying more self-defense forces to guard the emission points. I want the whole world to see that Japan is not afraid of threats.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#x27;t know you have the ability to mess things up until you push yourself. Jiro Kishida is in this state now. The interior minister turned pale. Your excellency, what if? There&#x27;s no room for whatifs. If the great Sia kingdom dares to come, it will be a declaration of war.</p>
<p>Kishid Jiro interrupted him. Go and issue a public statement in response to the great Sia kingdom. All right. The minister of the interior was filled with helplessness. He knew that the fleet had been destroyed and the Yasakuni haunted toilet had mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>A double blow driven Kisha Jiro into a state of madness. He could only pray that the great Sia kingdom wouldn&#x27;t actually do anything outrageous. Soon, the Kingdom of Sakura has once again issued a statement in response to the Kingdom of Sy. Our country&#x27;s pollution discharge plan will proceed as scheduled and complies with international emission standards. If you have any objections, you can sue us in the national court.</p>
<p>The announcement was released. The little bastard from the cherry blossom country was completely excited. Yash, this is what our great cherry blossom country should be like. We should let the whole world see that our cherry blossom country is not afraid of the great Sia country. Even if the great Sia kingdom has advanced technology, our Sakura kingdom has an iron will.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. We have millions of warriors. No one can bully us. All the little bastards had found an outlet for their emotions. They started going crazy like they&#x27;d been injected with adrenaline regarding the announcement from Japan in response.</p>
<p>The Great Sia Kingdom ignored it. After all, the Great Sa Kingdom was still celebrating the spring festival. Nobody will waste too much time here. We&#x27;ll discuss everything after the fifth day of the Lunar New Year. Siaki Yuan, the entire Syaku Academy is on holiday.</p>
<p>Lynchin also had a rare moment of leisure. He saw the Japanese response announcement. You little devils trying to use the United Nations as a shield. I&#x27;ll show you how flowers turn red on that day. Then he then got busy.</p>
<p>The white emperor aerospace fighter jet has successfully completed its maiden flight. Next, we need to prepare for a manned lunar landing. A man lunar landing would certainly require a space plane capable of long range travel. He wants to get the design of the space plane sorted out in the next few days. This is the new technology that Lynshin chose to inherit after completing the inheritance of aerospace fighter technology.</p>
<p>Time passed day by day. The entire great Sea Kingdom was celebrating the spring festival. It seems everyone has almost forgotten about Japan&#x27;s discharge of nuclear wastewater. The morning of the fifth day, Siakiuan body aerospace fighter parking point. Shaolu, this mission might be dangerous.</p>
<p>You must ensure your own safety before carrying out any mission. General Jeang gave serious instructions. Lu Xiaoyang stood at attention, saluted, and replied in a loud voice. General Xang, rest assured. I guarantee the mission will be accomplished.</p>
<p>As for security issues, he never worried. After learning that they were to carry out another mission to bomb the Japanese invaders, he immediately ended his leave and rushed from home to the military region. This is the day we&#x27;ve been waiting for. Last time, they only blew up one haunted toilet. That wasn&#x27;t enough to satisfy him.</p>
<p>This time he wanted to show the Japanese devils that the wrath of the great Sa Kingdom was not so easily endured. Okay, best of luck. Make sure you come back safely. General Jeang gave one last instruction before letting Luo Xiaoyang board the plane. Lu Xiaoyang saluted again.</p>
<p>Then they walked toward the bite sky fighter, close the hatch and start the fighter jet. Then it began to take off. The series of operations were performed smoothly and seamlessly. When Bidy ascended to an altitude of 2,000 meters, suddenly accelerated, it vanished into thin air in an instant, flying towards the land of cherry blossoms. General Xang and Lyn Shun, among others, arrived at the command center.</p>
<p>Shaolin, do you think Lu Xiaoyang will be able to complete the mission successfully this time? General Ciangs gaze fell on Lynch. Definitely. Lynch gave him a confident smile. This time, the White Emperor is fully loaded with quantum annihilation bombs to destroy the nuclear and thermal power plants of the Sakura country. That&#x27;s good.</p>
<p>General nodded. After this, Japan should be quiet for a while. He he would be best if they continued to court death. A barely perceptible smile appeared on Linshens lips. It&#x27;s best if those little devils don&#x27;t stop.</p>
<p>He had another excuse to deal with them. When the time comes, well just go and detonate their Mount Fuji. Let&#x27;s see how arrogant they can be now. Lie Jian Guo standing to the side was speechless. Shaolin, you really are a wararmonger.</p>
<p>Lynshin immediately denied it. Old Lee, don&#x27;t wrong me. I&#x27;m a nuclear peace conservative. Lie Jian Guo smirked inwardly cursing. You&#x27;re a conservative.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re the kind of conservative who thinks the Hawks are too conservative. Then they turned their attention to the big screen. At this time, the White Emperor has already flown out of the Great Sea Kingdom and is getting closer and closer to the Cherry Blossom Kingdom. At the same time, wastewater discharge site in Japan. The self-defense forces armed with guns set up a cordon around the discharge outlet.</p>
<p>An NHK television camera focuses on the valve. Another shot is taken at the prime minister&#x27;s residence facing Mayajurro. The entire event will be broadcast live. Jiro Kishida shouted at the camera from the high platform in front of the prime minister&#x27;s office. Fellow citizens, today our great cherry blossom country is about to take an important step.</p>
<p>The threat from the great Sa Kingdom cannot intimidate us. The cherry blossom kingdom will never yield. Bastards in the audience cheered wildly. Long live the land of cherry blossoms. The land of cherry blossoms will never surrender.</p>
<p>Kishidurro waved his hand and began to announce, &quot;Open the slle gates. Discharge the sewage. Chapter 103. Another mysterious disappearance in the NHK live broadcast room. The comments section of the Sakura country little Baka video went completely crazy.</p>
<p>This is what the great Sakura Empire should be like. Isn&#x27;t the great Sia Kingdom powerful? Come and stop us. What&#x27;s wrong with discharging nuclear wastewater? We can discharge it whenever we want. If you&#x27;re so capable, let your space planes come and bomb us. The screen was filled with arrogant remarks, almost bursting it.</p>
<p>South Korean nizens were furious when they saw this. Damn it. These lunatics are really going to line up. Our fishing grounds are doomed. Who will stop them? Where is the great Sia Kingdom? They said they were going to teach the Sakura Kingdom a lesson, but why aren&#x27;t they doing anything now? Is the great Sia Kingdom also afraid? The barrage of comments expressing impotent rage kept going off, but all they could do was watch helplessly as it appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>The Cherry Blossom Elementary School is preparing to release water in the live broadcast room of the Great Sa Kingdom. The atmosphere, however, was unusually relaxed. Don&#x27;t rush. Let the little devils jump around a bit more. He only in this way can the country have an excuse to deal with them.</p>
<p>The more frantic the Japanese devils are now, the more desperate they will become in a moment. I bet the exhaust outlet will be gone within 3 minutes. All nizens from the great sea kingdom are full of confidence. This is the confidence that national scientific and technological development has given them. In the past, they might have done the same thing as South Korean nisens, but things are completely different today.</p>
<p>They believe that the higher-ups would definitely take action. On the other side, Jurro Kishida saw the valve at the discharge outlet begin to slowly turn. A smug smile curled at the corner of his mouth. Great Sia Kingdom, you still dare not make a move. Just then, 5,000 m above the emission outlet, the mighty aerospace fighter jet was already hovering there.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang sat in the cockpit of the White Emperor, his eyes cold. You little devils, the game is over. He pressed the bomb release button. Quantum annihilation bomb slid off the belly of the fighter jet. Like a black lightning bolt, it crashed towards the discharge point and the entire Fukushima nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz, buzz. There was no loud noise. There was no flame. A blinding white light instantly enveloped the entire Fukushima nuclear power plant and its discharge outlet. The white light dissipated.</p>
<p>The bizarre scene unfolded once again. The original location of the Fukushima nuclear power plant along with the surrounding equipment and self-defense force soldiers has all disappeared. All that remained was a smooth, giant, terrifying crater. It&#x27;s tens of meters deep as if a piece of it was dug out out of thin air. this unexpected scene.</p>
<p>Kisha Jiro&#x27;s face instantly froze. His eyes widened in disbelief. What? What&#x27;s going on? Where is my emissions outlet? Where are the people? He rubbed his eyes frantically, thinking it was a hallucination. But the huge pit was right in front of them, cold and real. Kishida was completely stunned, seemingly unable to accept this cruel reality.</p>
<p>Bastards in the audience immediately fell silent. The excitement I felt just now has completely vanished. Instead, there was extreme fear. Disappeared. Disappeared again.</p>
<p>Just like the haunted toilets in Yasakone. Is this divine punishment? We&#x27;re doomed. It must be the gods punishing us. Quick, kneelled down and begged the gods to spare us. Some people were the first to react, immediately, kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy.</p>
<p>The others knelt down one after another, frantically cowtowing and begging for mercy. This bizarre event, they believed it was divine punishment. On the other side, Japanese Self-Defense Force soldiers around the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The hand holding the gun began to tremble. They looked up at the sky wearily, but could see nothing.</p>
<p>The White Emperor&#x27;s stealth capabilities allow it to float like a ghost at an altitude of 5,000 m. Baka, where is the enemy? Where should we attack? Could it really be divine punishment? Fear spread like a plague, and no one dared to approach the pit again. NHK&#x27;s live broadcast footage. still facing that big pit. Audiences around the world witnessed this bizarre scene.</p>
<p>The live stream chat in Japan was instantly cleared of all comments. A few seconds later, someone sent a message, their voice trembling. It&#x27;s over. We&#x27;ve been punished by the gods again. Wouldn&#x27;t have done such a despicable thing.</p>
<p>My lord god, please spare us. Well never dare to do it again. Almost all the Japanese soldiers believe that they were being punished by the gods. Only in this way can this bizarre event be explained. In the South Korean live stream, Korean nizens were stunned for a few seconds, then erupted in celebration.</p>
<p>Haha, well done. This is retribution. It&#x27;s for discharging nuclear waste water. Haha. It must be our great South Korean god who has made a move.</p>
<p>You little devils. Let&#x27;s see how arrogant you are. South Korea has started boasting again. They claimed that the feat of the white emperor&#x27;s space planes was accomplished by the gods of their South Korean country, completely forgetting how anxious and impotently furious he had been just moments before. The live stream room of the great Sia Kingdom was completely buzzing with excitement.</p>
<p>Holy crap, it really got blown up. Not even 3 minutes have passed. What did I tell you? I knew this would happen. Those Japanese devils must be stunned. It must have been the parents who did it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same as the haunted toilet from before. All nizens in the great Sia Kingdom unanimously believe that the government intervened. After all, we had already been through the haunted toilet. Siakiuan, inside the command center. General Jeang stared at the screen so excited that he slammed his fist on the table.</p>
<p>Great. Excellent. Well done, Ronald. Doing Li Jang Guo couldn&#x27;t help but nod, his eyes filled with satisfaction. Kobayashi, this quantum annihilation bomb really didn&#x27;t disappoint.</p>
<p>Lynshin smiled slightly, but his eyes never left the screen. This is just an appetizer. Next, it&#x27;s time for them to experience the effects of nuclear radiation. Simply destroying their nuclear power plant would be too easy on those little devils. They definitely need to experience the consequences of their own actions.</p>
<p>As expected, a few minutes later, the radiation monitoring devices in Japan started alarming frantically. Beep beep beep. The piercing sound echoed around the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Radiation levels are too high. Seriously hot.</p>
<p>A technician looked at the data and his face turned deathly pale. It&#x27;s nuclear radiation. It&#x27;s spreading from the crater. Upon hearing this, Kishid Jiro&#x27;s legs went weak and he almost fell over. Nuclear radiation.</p>
<p>How could there be nuclear radiation? The entire Fukushima nuclear power plant has disappeared. How can there still be nuclear radiation? Baka, we&#x27;re the experts. All of you come out here. He roared madly, but no one dared to answer. No one knows why such a strange thing happened, so none of them dared to step forward and explain.</p>
<p>Seeing that no one responded, Kishida Jiurro finally broke down. He slumped to the ground, his eyes vacant, his face contorted with grief. Why is this happening? Is it the great Sia kingdom, or is there truly divine punishment? God, why are you treating our cherry blossom country like this? Why? Kisha Jiro roared in frustration. He just couldn&#x27;t understand it since everything had been going so smoothly. But at the crucial final moment, it suffered a devastating blow.</p>
<p>Was it because he didn&#x27;t keep smiling the whole time? Chapter 104. Paralyzing the power system of the land of cherry blossoms. A moment later, Defense Minister Taro Yamamoto rushed in. Prime Minister, the nuclear radiation is spreading too rapidly. Residents in the surrounding area must be evacuated.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Kishida Jurro finally came to his senses, took a deep breath, and calmed himself down. Immediately notify residents within a 50 km radius to evacuate. Have the self-defense forces turn all their radars up to maximum power and see if they can find the enemy. Yes. Yamamoto dared not delay and rushed off to relay the order.</p>
<p>Kishidro paused for a moment, then picked up the satellite phone again and dialed the number of the American president. President Opton, quickly get your troops stationed on the island to help find the enemy. If we don&#x27;t do something about it, the entire country of Japan is doomed. There was a few seconds of silence on the other end of the phone. Optin&#x27;s impatient voice came through.</p>
<p>Kishida, are you sure you were attacked? I&#x27;m not sure either. That&#x27;s why I need your help. Our radar can&#x27;t see anything. Only your equipment can detect stealth targets. Kisha Jiro pleaded in a low humble voice.</p>
<p>I see. Optin paused for a moment. Then I&#x27;ll have the island garrison activate the anti-stalth radar and give it a try. The call ended. Jurro Kishida gripped his phone, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>He always kept that sentence in his heart. People who smile often are lucky. It&#x27;s a pity. People who force a smile usually end up being more unlucky. At the same time, high in the sky, B&#x27;s air-to-air fighter jets moved like ghosts.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang stared at the radar screen, his eyes sharp as knives. Report to command center. The Fukushima nuclear power plant has been dealt with. Next target. Concai nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Linshen&#x27;s calm voice came through the communicator. Be careful. Completely disable their power system. Receive. Lu Xiaoyang pressed the control lever.</p>
<p>The fighter jet made a nimble turn and flew towards the Concai region. The aircraft flew over the cities of Japan, the land of cherry blossoms. Concai nuclear power plant. The staff were still nervously watching the screen. They had received news from Fukushima and everyone was distracted.</p>
<p>What do we do? Fukushima is all gone. Will we be next? Don&#x27;t talk nonsense. Our air defense system is very powerful. The words had barely left his mouth. The radar screen suddenly filled with static.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on? Is the radar broken? The technician frantically typed on the keyboard. The next second, a blinding white light fell from the sky. The entire main control room of the nuclear power plant was instantly enveloped. The white light dissipated. The reactor that once stood there has vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Bastards inside were all wiped out. It was quickly annihilated along with the entire nuclear power plant. Lu Xiaoyang looked at the results on the screen and a cold smile curled at the corner of his mouth. Next up, the East Longitude thermal power plant. The fighter jets continued flying inside the Dong Jing thermal power plant.</p>
<p>The workers are still busy. They received no warning. They only felt the ground suddenly shake. The little bastards inside were annihilated by the quantum annihilation bomb. Lu Xiaoyang continued his bombardment.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, nuclear power plants and thermal power plants in Japan are disappearing one after another. Some are in the city center and some are in remote suburbs. Each flash of white light meant that an energy facility had vanished. Streets and alleys. Panic began to spread.</p>
<p>No power. There&#x27;s no power at home. The supermarket lights are off, too. I heard the nuclear power plant was bombed and nuclear radiation is coming. Well, it must be the gods punishing us.</p>
<p>People rushed into the supermarket like mad, scrambling to buy water and food. The shelves were knocked over and the goods were scattered all over the floor. Some people even fight over a bottle of water. Security guards were trying to maintain order on the streets, but they couldn&#x27;t stop the frenzied crowds at all. Jiro Kishida sat in the prime minister&#x27;s residence.</p>
<p>Bad news kept coming in. Prime Minister, the Kai nuclear power plant is gone. The Dongjing thermal power plant has been destroyed. The solar power plant in Osaka has also disappeared. Kishida Jiurro finally stopped laughing, stood up abruptly, and overturned the table.</p>
<p>Documents and teacups were scattered all over the floor. How so? Where are our radars? Where are our self-defense forces? Where are the US troops stationed? Why haven&#x27;t we spotted any enemies? He roared like a wild beast out of control. At this moment, he was absolutely certain that this was the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s revenge. There is no such thing as divine punishment. Taro Yamamoto cautiously explained.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, it seems like all our radars have malfunctioned. We haven&#x27;t detected anything. Where is the US? Where are their anti-stalth radars? The Americans say they said they didn&#x27;t detect any targets. Can&#x27;t even the US detect it? Kishid Jurro was stunned, his eyes vacant. He knew that Japan was truly finished.</p>
<p>So many power plants were destroyed. The entire Sakura country will be without power. In this era, not having electricity is tantamount to returning to a primitive society. Great Sia Kingdom, you forced me into this situation. Kishidro&#x27;s eyes were filled with madness.</p>
<p>The land of cherry blossoms is in dire straits. It&#x27;s time to play that trump card. On the other side, in the land of cherry blossoms, twothirds of the area is completely without power. The subway is shut down. The elevators are out of service, and the hospital&#x27;s backup generators won&#x27;t last much longer.</p>
<p>Television and the internet were completely cut off. People didn&#x27;t know what was happening outside and could only rely on word of mouth. Almost all of them say that they were punished by the gods. Some say it was an alien invasion. Various rumors spread, exacerbating the panic.</p>
<p>The large screen on the street was originally playing the news. Now all that&#x27;s left is pitch black. High altitude. Lu Xiaoyang looked at the data on the screen, his face full of pride. Report to command center.</p>
<p>All nuclear power plants and thermal power plants in Japan have been destroyed. The solar power plant also destroyed five key sites. General Ciangs excited voice came through the communicator. Good. Well done.</p>
<p>Lynshins voice also carried a hint of amusement. Let&#x27;s return. Let them have a good taste of what it&#x27;s like to return to primitive society. Receive. Lu Xiaoyang piloted the fighter jet and began its return journey.</p>
<p>The White Emperor&#x27;s aerospace fighter jets flew towards the direction of the Great Sa Kingdom. This mission has been successfully completed. Lu Xiaoyang was already making plans in his mind. This time when we go back, we&#x27;ll definitely be able to have a separate page for the family genealogy. You little devils, I hope you continue to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Hey. Hey. on the ground inside the command center of the Xaku Academy. General Xang slammed his fist on the table and shouted excitedly, &quot;Great. Now, let&#x27;s see how arrogant those little devils can be.&quot; Li Jian Guo smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>Shaolin, you really have a way with things. Japan on the screen. It was covered with red markings indicating the destroyed energy facilities. His lips curled slightly upward and his eyes were deep and profound. After this incident, Japan should know what fear is.</p>
<p>Now we can focus on developing our technology. Next project, space plane. Objective manned lunar landing. Chapter 105. The Sakura country is driven to the brink.</p>
<p>Space plane. Man moon landing. General and Li Jang Guo were stunned. Then I got excited. Xan, have you finished the plan? Lie Jang Guo looked at Lin Chin excitedly, his eyes full of anticipation.</p>
<p>General Zeniangs eyes gleamed with fervor as he eagerly asked, &quot;Shaolin, can you really do it? The great Xiao Kingdom has always had a plan for a man lunar landing. However, the project is still in the feasibility study stage to truly achieve a man lunar landing. It is expected to take 5 years.&quot; General Jeang only knew a little bit of information, which is why he was so excited when Lynchin mentioned it. Lynch nodded confidently. Can the design for the space plane is ready? It is a space plane specifically designed for man lunar landings and interplanetary transport.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, General Jeang couldnt help but swallow hard and asked excitedly, &quot;Shaolin, according to your plan, when can we land on the moon?&quot; &quot;One month.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; General Zang exclaimed in shock, &quot;A man moon landing in just 1 month.&quot; Li Jian Guo also got excited and grabbed Lynchs arm, wanting to go back. Shaolin, let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go back and get the project approved now. Lynshan patted Li Jang Wos hand and said with a smile Lee don&#x27;t worry well discuss it slowly when we get back moreover the engineers are currently on vacation so well start the project once they return there will be enough time that&#x27;s right Li Jang Guoo slapped his forehead realizing his mistake and then smiled somewhat embarrassedly I got too excited then they continued chatting waiting for Bid to return at the same time in Japan it swept across the globe like a tsunami On the international forum, nizens from all over the world were completely outraged. My god, twothirds of Japan&#x27;s power is gone.</p>
<p>Serves them right. Who told them to discharge nuclear wastewater? Could it be the Great Sea Kingdom or is it an alien invasion? In the South Korean live stream, nizens went wild. Haha, those little devils finally got their comeuppants. You dumped nuclear waste water. Now you&#x27;re out of power.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see how arrogant you can be now. All countries fell silent. They all guessed that it was the great Sia kingdom that did it, but no one dared to stand up and accuse them. Even the United Nations didn&#x27;t dare to issue any statement. Highle officials from various countries are holding emergency meetings, reassess relations with the great seia kingdom.</p>
<p>Previously, some countries even dared to join the US in targeting the great sea kingdom. Now they&#x27;ve all changed their tune and started actively contacting the great seia kingdom. I want to repair the relationship in the US White House. In the president&#x27;s office, Opton looked at the report filled with anger. Useless.</p>
<p>A bunch of useless trash. He suddenly threw the report on the ground, scattering the papers all over the floor. Secretary of War Peter rushed in, holding another report in his hand. President, the nuclear radiation in Japan has spread to a distance of 20 km, and it&#x27;s all spreading on land, which is very strange. Opton looked up abruptly, his eyes filled with shock.</p>
<p>Does the great Sea Kingdom intend to destroy the entire Cherry Blossom Kingdom? Convene an emergency meeting immediately. Get the Department of Defense, NASA, and the chairman of the joint conference all here. Also, summon all the military experts. This situation has occurred. There&#x27;s no need for further investigation.</p>
<p>It was definitely done by the great SEA Kingdom. Even if they have no evidence, this does not preclude their conclusion. Mr. for president. It&#x27;s 11:00 p.m.</p>
<p>now. Pete reminded him cautiously. I don&#x27;t care. Optin roared. Go now.</p>
<p>Any later and it will be too late. Pete didn&#x27;t dare to argue and turned to run away quickly. In the office. Optin slumped in his chair, clutching his hair with both hands. The Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Could it be that they want to dominate Earth? If the Great Sa Kingdom wants to dominate the Blue Star, then the biggest opponent must be us, the United States. At that time, thinking of this, Opton shuddered. My back was instantly soaked with cold sweat. No, we must find a way to speed up the development of weapons and equipment for the US. Only in this way can the United States remain invincible.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the White House emergency meeting room. The atmosphere was extremely oppressive. Opton sat in the main seat, his face so gloomy it could drip water. Of Japan&#x27;s energy facilities being destroyed were displayed on the large screen. Each image clearly shows the smooth large pit.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Pit spoke first, his voice grave. President, according to intelligence, all the energy facilities destroyed in Japan are in the same situation as the Yasakuni shrine that disappeared before. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff frowned. It must have been the Great Sa Kingdom, only they have the capability. NASA administrator Trudeau pushed up his glasses, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Just how many more cuttingedge technologies is the great SIA kingdom hiding? Optin slammed his fist on the table and roared, enough. Now is not the time to talk about these things. We must find a way to deal with this. If we allow the great SA kingdom to continue like this, we will lose our hegemonic position. Silence felt over the meeting room.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Pete spoke up. Mr. President, perhaps we can unite with other countries to impose sanctions on the great sea kingdom. Optton sneered. sanctions.</p>
<p>Do you think any country would dare to join us in sanctioning the great Sia Kingdom? Japan is a prime example. Who wants to follow in their footsteps? Then what do we do? Pete asked, frowning. Opton took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. Convene an emergency global summit immediately. Notify all allies that we must devise a countermeasure.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom must not be allowed to continue leading. Let&#x27;s all pull our scientific research resources and strive to catch up with the great sea kingdom in terms of weaponry and equipment. At the same time, a man lunar landing must be carried out before the great sea kingdom. Regarding this proposal, no one in the meeting room had any objections. This is also the best solution at present unless they are willing to bow down to the great SA kingdom, but they can&#x27;t do it.</p>
<p>Of cherry blossoms, the chaos has reached its peak. In major cities, supermarket glass doors were smashed by crowds. Shelves were overturned and instant noodles and bottled water were scattered all over the ground. Someone was carrying a few bottles of water when they were pushed to the ground by the people behind them. But he struggled to his feet and lunged to grab the bread again, his face contorted with rage.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t take it. It&#x27;s mine. You all should just give up and die. Someone yelled and picked up a can of food from the shelf and threw it at the crowd. Security personnel dressed in riot gear formed a human wall in an attempt to stop them, but it was scattered and broken by the frenzied crowd.</p>
<p>The entire country of cherry blossoms seems to have entered an apocalyptic era ahead of schedule. Prime Minister&#x27;s office Jirro Kishida slumped in a chair, his hair disheveled and his suit full of wrinkles. Taro Yamamoto rushed in, his face pale. Your excellency, something terrible has happened. Now only a handful of power plants are still operating across the country.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a power shortage everywhere. Kishaurro suddenly raised his head, his eyes bloodshot. Great Sia Kingdom, I&#x27;m not finished with you. He hurriedly left the prime minister&#x27;s residence and took a helicopter to a secret base. Chapter 106 Kuing Space Plane.</p>
<p>The helipad of the Xyaku Academy. The silver gray fuselage of the bitey aerospace fighter jet was steadily parked in a designated position. The hatch opened. Lu Xiaoyang straightened his back and walked down. His face still bore the mark of lingering excitement.</p>
<p>Little Luo, General Jeang strode forward and patted him heavily on the shoulder. Well done. Lu Xiaoyang saluted, his voice booming. Serving the country is what I should do. Lie Jang Guoo smiled and nodded, his eyes full of approval.</p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work. Go and get some rest. Watching Lu Xiaoyang go to rest. Lyn Shankai said to Lie Jian Guo, &quot;Mr. Lee, let&#x27;s go back to the office and talk about the space plane.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Lie Jang Wos eyes lit up. I&#x27;ve been waiting to hear your proposal. Seeing this, General Jeang waved his hand and said, &quot;You guys discuss the technical aspects. I&#x27;ll go arrange the follow-up work.</p>
<p>Call me anytime if you need anything.&quot; The two nodded in agreement and walked side by side toward the office building of the Siaku Academy. In the office, Lynshin turned on his computer and pulled up the design drawing he had prepared beforehand. On the screen, a silver aircraft with a futuristic look suddenly appeared. Its fuselav is several times larger than the bitey and its wings are designed in the shape of a rock spreading its wings. Oldly lookin pointed to the screen.</p>
<p>This is the space plane I designed and I named it Kuan Pung. Lie Jian Guo leaned closer to the screen, his eyes focused. Kuan Pung, what a great name. It&#x27;s impressive. Tell me the specs quickly.</p>
<p>Lynchin slid his fingertips across the keyboard, bringing up detailed data. First, there are the dimensions. The Kimping space plane is 95 m long with a wingspan of 75 m, a height of 25 m, an empty weight of 75 tons, and a maximum payload of over 500 tons. What a load capacity of 500 tons. Li Jian Guo was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>This is not a space plane. It&#x27;s clearly a space transport spacecraft. the world&#x27;s largest transport aircraft, the N225, has a payload capacity of only 250 tons, but he can only fly inside Earth. Even Musk&#x27;s supposedly invincible Starship only has a maximum payload of 300 tons, and it&#x27;s a one-time use vessel. Even if recycling is considered, the load capacity is only 100 to 150 tons.</p>
<p>The Kuong space plane, however, is designed to fly to the moon and return. It can actually carry a load of 500 tons. Terrifying. Sial, are you sure you didn&#x27;t add an extra zero? Definitely not. Those parameters are terrifying.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo was deeply shocked by the number. Lin Shun continued, &quot;The Kuaning space plane uses three newly enhanced anti-gravity plasma engines. Its speed inside Earth can reach Mach 20, and after leaving near Earth orbit, its maximum speed can reach Mach 60. It&#x27;s possible to make a round trip from the moon to Earth in a single day. After listening, Li Jian Guo fell silent.</p>
<p>Mach 60. Is this the speed that current human technology can achieve? The world&#x27;s fastest intercontinental strategic missile, even after terminal acceleration, only reaches a speed of Mach 35. Lynshen&#x27;s space plane reached a terrifying speed of Mach 60. This is two to three times faster than the By Sky Fighter. That&#x27;s absolutely outrageous.</p>
<p>Shaolin, are you sure it&#x27;s not Mach 6? Li Jang Guoo asked timidly. He Lynchan chuckled. It&#x27;s Mach 60. It seems I really am getting old. Lie Jian Guo sighed inexplicably.</p>
<p>He had to accept that he was getting old. Lynshins design concepts are increasingly exceeding his comprehension. The body aerospace fighter jet is barely acceptable. The Kuaning space plane has completely overturned his understanding. with a load capacity of 500 tons and a speed of Mach 60.</p>
<p>Achieving either of these two data points individually would be incredibly impressive. Achieving both simultaneously would be an epicm feat. It has revolutionized traditional spacecraft. You mean by the US wanting to start a space race? It&#x27;s ridiculous. How can they compete with the coimping space plane? Oldly you&#x27;re not old at all.</p>
<p>Our great SEA kingdom owes its solid foundation to the older generation of scientists like you. That&#x27;s why we can stand on the shoulders of giants and continued to innovate. Lynch sighed from the bottom of his heart. His eyes revealed his admiration for Lie Jian Guo and other older generation scientists. Without the selfless dedication of their older generation of scientists without it, the great Sa Kingdom would not have achieved its current glory.</p>
<p>He was merely adding icing on the cake, standing on the shoulders of giants to continue climbing the peak of technology. In any case, the contributions of the older generation of scientists are indelible. Eh, you&#x27;re just trying to comfort me. At my age, I would be satisfied just to see my country set foot on the moon. Li Jian Guo waved his hand, but his face was filled with a gratified smile.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, elderly. It definitely will. Lynch nodded emphatically. You will not only see us build a lunar base, but also see us leave the solar system and even conquer the universe. He wasn&#x27;t just making empty promises.</p>
<p>Because within the category of inherited techniques, there is also biotechnology. One of the technologies involved, gene therapy, can extend human lifespan, but it hasn&#x27;t been unlocked yet. It can only be unlocked after he raises the overall technological level of the great Sia kingdom to level one civilization. Currently, all unlocked biotechnology categories are in the biomedical field. In the future, he will gradually accept the inheritance of biotechnology to protect ordinary people from illness and disaster.</p>
<p>Some advanced technologies require strong military support to be effective. Otherwise, countries like the US might go to extreme lengths, even waging war to seize it. Eh, it&#x27;s enough that you have the intention, Liian Guo said dismissively. Just take it as lynch and comforting him. He is now nearly 70 years old.</p>
<p>How many more years can he live? He might still be able to see the world if he builds a lunar base, but the idea is to leave the solar system and conquer the universe. He stopped hoping for it. It&#x27;s too far away. Seeing Li Jang Wos attitude, Lyn Shin became even more determined to let the older generation of scientists witness the moment when the country conquers the universe. He smiled and continued to introduce the Kuing Space plane.</p>
<p>Oldly, you&#x27;ll find out the rest later. Let me continue explaining the Kuing Space Blane to you. The first Kimping space plane has a crew cabin with six seats. Lynchin pulled up a diagram of the crew cabin. In addition to two drivers, it can also carry four researchers.</p>
<p>The fuselage is equipped with a superpowered laser cannon defensive weapon. In the future, it can be directly converted into a space airliner which can carry up to 5,000 passengers. Looking at the screen, Lie Jian Guo couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim, &quot;Shaolin, your design has considered every single problem with Kuan Pong. Landing on the moon in a month is truly not just empty talk.&quot; Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;The technology is fine, but there&#x27;s a key problem. We don&#x27;t have enough manpower.&quot; Lie Jian Guo was taken aback.</p>
<p>Manpower? Doesn&#x27;t the Sia Academy of Sciences have enough engineers? It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not enough, it&#x27;s that it won&#x27;t be enough for the future. Linshen said seriously, Kuing is just the first step. We also need to build a lunar base, the Nanchiman space city, and so on. The current team can&#x27;t handle such a large operation. He wanted to take advantage of this opportunity, encourage major research and development institutions to increase their recruitment of new talent.</p>
<p>Only in this way can we meet the needs of the increasing number of projects that follow. As civilization levels rise, scientists become the most important element. Only a sufficiently large talent pool can cultivate a large number of top scientists. This allows them to continuously advance their civilization&#x27;s technological level and elevate their civilization&#x27;s overall level. Otherwise, it would be just him alone.</p>
<p>Even if I worked myself to death, it would be impossible to complete so many research and development projects. Therefore, it is necessary to recruit a large number of talents. It&#x27;s not just about recruiting talent. We must continue to increase the number of new people. However, we need to take it one step at a time.</p>
<p>Chapter 107. South Heavenly Gate Space City. In the office, the air suddenly became eerily still. Lie Jian Guo stared at Lin Chun, his fingers unconsciously stroking the table. I understand that we don&#x27;t have enough manpower.</p>
<p>I can understand the idea of a lunar base, but what you called the southern heavenly gate. His Adams apple bobbed and his voice trembled. What the hell is this South Heavenly Gate? Could it be one of those real space cities from science fiction movies? He finally managed to process the outrageous parameters of the coimping space plane. A lunar base is somewhat understandable. Now another one, Nanchiman space city has emerged.</p>
<p>Is this going to defy the heavens? The Great Sea Kingdom also has its own independently built space station. However, they are all pieced together from individual space capsules. Moreover, it can only accommodate a few people to stay there permanently. Even so, it&#x27;s already top tier on Earth. It has absolutely nothing to do with the so-called space city.</p>
<p>Lynchin smiled and opened a folder, then opened a design drawing. The painting depicts a circular building like a giant ship floating in space. This This is what you planned. Lie Jian Guo was breathing rapidly, his chest heaving violently. His eyes were filled with shock as if he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>A lunar base is already mind-blowing enough. Now another one, Nanchiman, has appeared. Just how much is Lynchin hiding? Lynchan observed Lee Jang Wos reaction. A slight smile appeared at the corner of his lips. He got up and walked to the screen.</p>
<p>The fingertip taps on the draft. Mr. Lee calmed down. The South Heavenly Gate didn&#x27;t appear out of thin air. This is the next step for the coimping space plane.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo took a deep breath to calm his excited emotions. He stared at the screen, waiting for Lynchin to explain, but his heart was pounding, proving that he was still excited. Lynchin pulled up a more detailed design drawing. The internal structure of the circular building is clearly visible. It has residential areas, experimental areas, energy cores, and even production and planning areas.</p>
<p>Nanchiman Space City. It will be built in low Earth orbit. One side connects to Earth, and the other side connects to the moon. It is a transit point and an outpost. It&#x27;s also a super fortress protecting Earth.</p>
<p>These are all simple 3D diagrams. It&#x27;s not a real technical design drawing yet. It was something Lin Shun had conceived and planned out in advance. He has not yet received the proper training in the technology to build a real space city. It&#x27;s not time yet.</p>
<p>We must wait until the moon is developed before we can build a space city. Otherwise, with Earth&#x27;s current resources, building a space city would be quite difficult. In particular, the energy system is simply unable to meet the demand. The reason for bringing this up now is simply to give Lie Jang Guo a heads up, but it won&#x27;t take too long. Lie Jian Guo seemed to be still processing the massive amount of information.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth, but didn&#x27;t know where to begin. After a moment, he recovered and asked with a complicated look in his eyes, Shaolin, do you have a plan that&#x27;s even further ahead? Yes. Lynch nodded. Whether it&#x27;s going to the moon or to even more distant planets in the future, these are all our bases. The space city is responsible for growing food and manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p>Then a space factory will be built based on the South Heavenly Gate. Then build the spaceships and interstellar warships needed for space travel. These are not unfounded. These are all technologies that will be realized in the near future. Lie Jiano listened.</p>
<p>He suddenly let out a long sigh. He leaned back in his chair, his eyes a little red. I&#x27;ve lived for almost 70 years. When I was young, I thought it would be great if I could build a satellite. Later, I saw a high-speed rail and aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>I thought this was the peak, but now he pointed to the space city on the screen. Lunar base, space city. These are things I used to only see in science fiction movies. It&#x27;s actually going to happen in our hands. He raised his hand and wiped the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>His voice was choked with sobs. If those old buddies were still around, seeing these will definitely make me laugh in my sleep. Lynchin looked at Li Jian Guo and was also somewhat moved. Oldly we will build all of these. Let the whole world know.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom can not only stand at the top of the blue star, it can still stand at the top of the universe. Lie Jang Guo nodded. He suddenly sat up straight, his eyes becoming resolute. Salin, about the expansion plan you mentioned. I support it.</p>
<p>I will report this to my superiors. We need to do more than just recruit more engineers. We also need to build specialized schools to train space technology professionals. Lynch nodded. Okay, I&#x27;m sure the higher-ups will agree.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;ll report to my superiors right away. Wait for my good news. After saying that, Li Jang Wo left first and went back. Lynch watched Li Jang Wos retreating figure. I walked to the window and looked at the sky outside.</p>
<p>The sun is shining brightly and the sky is blue with white clouds. He knew it wouldn&#x27;t be long. Above this sky, there will be a space city belonging to the Great Sea Kingdom. There will be a vast ocean of stars that belongs to humankind. The Great Sa Kingdom now has the ability to protect itself.</p>
<p>While establishing a lunar base, it&#x27;s also time to vigorously develop technologies that benefit people&#x27;s lives. Anti-gravity flying cars can accelerate mass production and widespread adoption. Next, Lynchin continued to plan for future technological development. The space plane project will be approved soon. The next step may be to prepare for the construction of a lunar base.</p>
<p>The most important issue for a lunar base is energy. Current solar energy is usable, but it&#x27;s not enough. It seems we need to develop controlled nuclear fusion first. Lynchin made a decision in his heart. A few laboratories can be built first for the lunar base.</p>
<p>Once controlled nuclear fusion is successfully developed and the energy supply problem is solved to further develop lunar resources on a large scale then use lunar resources to build a space city. The plan is set at this point for now just as Lin Shun made his decision. Lee Jian Guo walked into the office with an excited expression. Shaolin, your suggestion has been approved by the higher-ups, made significant adjustments to the education sector, and also allowed major research institutes to expand their enrollment. Lynch nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Okay, let&#x27;s recruit more talent first. We can discuss and come up with corresponding measures for reform in the education field later. Lie Jian Guo nodded heavily and then said, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll go and ask the Sia Academy of Sciences to expand its enrollment.&quot; Many college graduates had submitted their resumes before, but since we were already full, we didn&#x27;t conduct any interviews. This is a good opportunity to do a thorough screening and bring in truly talented and passionate individuals. After saying that, he left first.</p>
<p>Soon, the staff of the personnel department of the Syaku Academy were asked to return early to work overtime. Guangi province. In a room of a unit in a residential building in a certain city, Fatty Wong lay in bed watching international news. You little devils, you finally met your match. He seeing the miserable state of Japan, Fatty Wong laughed so hard his face almost cramped up.</p>
<p>He rolled over, finding a more comfortable position to continue watching. Sigh, I wonder how old Lynn is doing. Old Lynn, what does aerospace warfare have to do with you? Fatty Wong secretly made his guess. He originally wanted to catch up with Lynn. As a result, the resume submitted to Siaki Yuan disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Initially, he even considered contacting Lin Shun to use connections. After thinking about it for the last time, I decided against it. Perhaps his abilities did not meet the requirements of the Sea Academy of Sciences. Just then, his phone suddenly received a text message. Who sent this text message? Wong Pongi clicked on it out of curiosity.</p>
<p>The text message reads, &quot;Wong, your resume has passed the initial review. Please come to the Shaman Academy for an interview when you have time.&quot; What? Fatty Wong sat up abruptly on the bed, making the whole bed tremble. Really or not? He immediately called the Seyaku Academy to inquire. After confirming it was true, I became completely excited. Haha, Laaki Yun, I fatty Wong am here.</p>
<p>After saying that, he immediately booked a plane ticket, packed his bags, and flew to Beijing. Chapter 108. The Japanese biological warriors, the land of cherry blossoms deep within Mount Fuji. A black helicopter flew low over the mountains and forests. The snow kicked up by the propellers smashed into the ground, creating a dense network of craters.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, Kishidurro gripped the armrest, his knuckles turning white. The trees outside the window rushed past. His eyes were crazed, but a strange smile played on his lips. Faster, faster. The driver didn&#x27;t dare to delay and suddenly accelerated.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the helicopter landed on a secluded platform at the entrance to a valley. A crack tens of meters wide appeared in the ground. A completely black magv car slid out. Your excellency, this way, please. Soldiers in white hazmat suits bent down to lead the way.</p>
<p>Jurro Kishida got into the car. The moment the car door closed, everything went dark. Only the green light from the dashboard illuminated his distorted face. Buzz. The mag lev train starts.</p>
<p>They plummeted rapidly down the sloping tunnel. The numbers on the screen kept changing. 50 m, 80 m, 100 m. It eventually came to rest on a platform 100 m underground. The car door opened.</p>
<p>A blinding white light instantly illuminated the field of vision. Kishida Jiro narrowed his eyes. What comes into view is an absurdly large underground base. Metal channels crisscross. Researchers in white coats hurried by.</p>
<p>The display screen on the wall scrolls through complex gene sequences. Your excellency, this is a super base that we built at a cost of $50 billion US. Dr. Kawashima, the person in charge, came forward and introduced the situation. The base&#x27;s outer shell is made of a special alloy that is 10 m thick and can withstand a nuclear attack with a yield of 1 megaton.</p>
<p>It has an independent oxygen circulation system inside so it can last for a year even if the ground is destroyed. Jurro Kishido walked to the huge floor to ceiling window. Inside are dozens of transparent culture chambers. The person soaking in the green nutrient solution was covered with black lines all over its body. His muscles were bulging and his pupils were bloodshot.</p>
<p>Kawashima, how&#x27;s the Bowarrior project going? His voice trembled, filled with urgency. This is their trump card. the land of cherry blossoms. This project has been ongoing since the beginning of World War II, although they were forced to destroy many biological laboratories after World War II. However, much experimental data is still retained.</p>
<p>Then it went from overt to covert with decades of continuous research and development. The project has now yielded some results. Dr. Kawashima adjusted his glasses and brought up the data panel. Your excellency, we have already trained 300 first generation warriors.</p>
<p>Their strength is five times that of the elite soldiers. Their speed is three times and their wound healing speed is 10 times that of ordinary people, and there&#x27;s no pain. He tapped the screen. The bio soldier in the incubation chamber suddenly opened his eyes. He slammed his fist against the bulkhead.</p>
<p>Bang! The thick-tempered glass made a terrifying sound. Kishid Jurro&#x27;s pupils contracted sharply and then he burst into wild laughter. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. With them, we can take revenge on the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Kawashima, speed things up. I need 1,000. No, 10,000. Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, the first generation of warriors had a defect. Their sanity will gradually fade, and they can only survive for a maximum of 3 months. Jiro Kishida&#x27;s smile froze. He stared at the soldiers in the incubation chamber with a sinister look in his eyes. 3 months is enough.</p>
<p>As long as the great Sia Kingdom pays the price, even if it means sacrificing our lives, it&#x27;s worth it. Dr. Kawashima frowned and advised. Your excellency, this won&#x27;t do, it will. Kishid Jiro interrupted directly.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care. We must produce the perfect warrior within one year. Otherwise, our Sakura country will be finished. Seeing Kishida Jiro&#x27;s madness, Dr. Kawashima thought for a moment and then spoke.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, if you want to take revenge on the great SA kingdom, I have other methods. What method? Kisha Jiro asked curiously. Dr. Kawashima remained silent for a few seconds, seemingly struggling internally. Finally, stealing his resolve, he spoke.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, during our research and development of Bowarriors, we discovered a type of Xacteria. We can upon hearing this, Kishida Dejiro immediately became excited. Yash, this is good. Can it be mass-produced? Dr. Kawashima nodded.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s possible, but we haven&#x27;t found a way to control the X bacteria yet. Once Kisha interrupted abruptly, his voice filled with malice. That&#x27;s exactly what we want, a way to avoid it. I want you to mass-produce it within 6 months. Dr.</p>
<p>Kawashima nodded helplessly. He didn&#x27;t know whether doing this was good or bad, but he had no choice. Kishaurro left excitedly. After boarding the helicopter, &quot;Great Sia Kingdom, you&#x27;ll be wiped out in 6 months.&quot; Kishaurro looked in the direction of the Great Sia Kingdom, his eyes filled with madness. The eighth day of the Lunar New Year, Beijing, at the entrance of the Shaman Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong stood at the entrance of the Shaman Academy of Sciences with his interview materials in hand. The three golden characters, Shaman Academy of Sciences, shown brightly in the sunlight. He took a deep breath and patted his chest. Old Lynn, it&#x27;s me, Fatty Wong, here. Next, he registered at the security room.</p>
<p>Then, following the instructions, proceed to the interview room. In the interview room, three interviewers sat at the table. Upon seeing Fatty Wong enter, one of them adjusted his glasses. Wong, did you apply for a resume for Weapon Systems before? Fatty Wong stood up straight and spoke in a loud voice. Yes.</p>
<p>Next, the interviewer began asking Fatty Wong various interview questions. Fatty Wong answered them all fluently. 1 hour later, the interviewer said with a smile, &quot;Wong, you&#x27;ve passed the interview. From today onwards, you are a member of the Weapons Research Institute.&quot; Fatty Wong was stunned for a moment, then became excited. &quot;Really? Thank you, specialist.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll definitely do my best.&quot; Clutching the offer letter, he ran wildly out of the conference room. Haha, Lin, well see each other soon. 2 p.m. Conference room of the Seyaku Academy. The Kuing Space Blane project initiation meeting has officially begun.</p>
<p>As is customary, all personnel signed a confidentiality agreement. Lynchin stood on the stage with the design drawings displayed on the large screen behind him. The silver fuselage resembles a soaring rock. He began by introducing the parameters and performance of the Kimping space plane. Kimping space plane.</p>
<p>The moment the words were spoken, the audience erupted in cheers. What 500 tons payload? That&#x27;s more than double that of the UN 225 Mach 60. That&#x27;s faster than an intercontinental ballistic missile. Chief engineer Lynn, is this really possible? An elderly academician stood up excitedly, his voice trembling. Lynshin smiled and nodded, then brought up more detailed parameters.</p>
<p>The fuselage is made of a brand new super alloy material. The murmurss from the audience gradually subsided. Everyone stared at the screen, their eyes filled with shock and fervor. After Lynn Chen&#x27;s introduction, they no longer questioned but were deeply shocked. Chief engineer Lynn, does that mean we&#x27;ll be able to send people to the moon very soon? An academician asked excitedly.</p>
<p>Lynshan nodded slightly. That&#x27;s right. It can be completed in a month at most. Very good. The entire conference room erupted in enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>It seems that everyone can already see the Chinese flag flying high on the moon in the near future. At this moment, Lie Jian Guo stood up, his voice loud and clear. I hereby announced that the Kuaning space plane project has been officially approved. With the full cooperation of all departments, we aim to achieve our goal within 1 month. He paused, his gaze sweeping across the entire room.</p>
<p>Mann lunar landing. Boom. The entire venue erupted in cheers. The applause and cheers nearly lifted the roof off. After the meeting, all experts, missians, and engineers began to perform their respective duties.</p>
<p>He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the research and development of the Kuanping space plane. At the same time, the US&#x27;s second Starship test flight has entered its final sprint. Even India&#x27;s manned rocket is ready to launch. The European Union is no exception. Capable countries are all putting in their best efforts.</p>
<p>They all want to be the first country to achieve a manned lunar landing, but they didn&#x27;t know that. in front of the Kuan Ping space plane of the great Sia Kingdom. It was all in vain. Chapter 109. Lin Shen&#x27;s first outburst of anger.</p>
<p>Siaki Yuan Weapons Research Institute laser gun project team. After Wong Panzi officially started working, he was assigned to this project team. On his first day at work, Fatty Wong was filled with excitement. Team leader Lao Jang came up to him and patted him on the shoulder. Shiaol Wong, right? Why don&#x27;t you familiarize yourself with the project information first? Fatty Wong smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll follow the team leader instructions. Okay, then you can familiarize yourself with the project information for the laser gun first. Your workstation is over there. If you have any questions, just ask your colleagues nearby. As old Jean spoke, he led Fatty Wong to a workstation.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong thanked him, then quickly tidied up and got to work. He opened the information about laser weapons on his computer. Lynn Shun, chief designer of super laser weapon development. I&#x27;ll blanch it. Could it be old Lynn? When Fatty Wong saw this name, the first person he thought of was Lin Shun, but he quickly dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>It must just be a coincidence of names. Old Lynn has been working on lithography machines and chips. How could he possibly be venturing into laser weapons? But a voice in his heart kept telling him, &quot;This is La Lin.&quot; Unable to contain himself any longer, he looked up at Old Jeang, who was still there, and asked in a trembling voice, &quot;Jang, team leader Jeang, which academician is this chief designer, Lynn Chun?&quot; Old Jean chuckled. &quot;He, this chief engineer, Lynn, isn&#x27;t an old academician, but a prodigy genius the same age as you. The same age as me.&quot; Fatty Wongs throat bobbed, his eyes filled with shock.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no doubt about it. It&#x27;s that guy, Old Len.&quot; When team leader Lo Jang saw Wong Ponzis reaction, he thought he had been provoked. He patted him on the shoulder and comforted him. Shia Wong, don&#x27;t compare yourself to a prodigy like Chief Engineer Len. He&#x27;s someone we look up to.</p>
<p>Just focus on learning and improving. Yes, I will try my best to catch up with Chief Engineer Lynn. Fatty Wong nodded like a chicken pecking at rice. Good, I understand. If you want to see the documents, I&#x27;ll go do other things.</p>
<p>After finishing his speech, team leader Jeang left. Only Fatty Wong was left sitting there looking disheveled. Damn it, old Lynn. You&#x27;ve kept this from me for so long. Next time I see you, you must treat me to a big meal.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong thought to himself. However, he did not intend to reveal that he and Lyn Shun were classmates, roommates, and best friends. Lynn Shun is now the chief engineer of the Seyaku Institute. I don&#x27;t want to put others in a difficult position because of him. He also wanted to make a contribution to the country through his own efforts.</p>
<p>Old Lynn, you wait. I&#x27;ll definitely catch up with you. Fatty Wong secretly cheered himself up. Next, he began to review the technical data on laser weapons. The more I looked at him, the more alarmed I became.</p>
<p>At the same time, he also felt that the gap between him and Lin Shan was getting bigger and bigger. This level of confidentiality information would be impossible if he hadn&#x27;t signed a confidentiality agreement before joining the project team. He probably won&#x27;t have the chance to see it in his lifetime. Old Lynn, it seems I&#x27;ll only ever see you standing alone on the mountaintop for the rest of my life. On the other side, Lynchin was looking at the parts list for the Kuan Ping space plane in his office.</p>
<p>I suddenly sneezed, &quot;Who&#x27;s talking about me?&quot; Lynchin rubbed his nose and muttered to himself. After reviewing the parts list, he just wanted to relax. &quot;Take out your phone and check what the latest trending news is. Just randomly click on the trending topics list. Japan is in chaos due to a power outage.</p>
<p>You little devils, this is just the beginning. You&#x27;re in for a world of hurt. When Lynshin saw the news about the Japanese, the corners of his mouth turned up slightly, revealing a barely perceptible sneer. Then he continued reading. Suddenly, a trending topic made Lynchin frown slightly.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about the issue of talent recruitment. Some universities have gone too far in their handling of the situation. Almost everyone is criticizing it. But there were also some sheep dogs and toilet fairies washing the floor. Their comments are disgusting to look at.</p>
<p>Lynshan watched a flash of anger in his eyes. Seeing this kind of incident, even with the best temper, he couldn&#x27;t help himself. Then he continued to check if there were any similar incidents. The result shocked him, harassing women, drunk driving, and hit and run, refusing to pay fines. Damn it, I never expected them to be so brazen in this country.</p>
<p>He suddenly stood up, grabbed his coat, and headed toward Li Jang Wos office. Mr. ly the door was pushed open and Linshins voice was filled with anger. Look at this news. Li Jang Guoo took the phone and immediately became furious.</p>
<p>Are these people out of their minds? Lynch said coldly. This is not an isolated case. I suggest a thorough investigation of all universities. Clean it up if it needs cleaning. Lie Jang Wos expression was serious.</p>
<p>Good. I&#x27;ll report it to my superiors right away. This kind of unhealthy trend should have been eradicated long ago. Okay. Lynchin nodded.</p>
<p>If you encounter any obstacles, tell me and I&#x27;ll personally go and communicate with the higher-ups. Shaolin, don&#x27;t worry. I guarantee you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this. Just focus on your project and wait for news. Lie Jian Guo patted his chest and guaranteed.</p>
<p>He could tell that Lynchan was truly angry this time. We must recommend that the higher-ups launch a major cleanup operation. Lynchan nodded and said nothing more. He went back to his office to wait for news. He made this suggestion for only one purpose.</p>
<p>The goal was to ensure that the bloodline of the great Sia people was not contaminated. According to his understanding, the French are about to be replaced by black blood. The country already has one-third black ancestry. Before long, the entire country of France will become a black country. Lynchin certainly didn&#x27;t want this situation to happen in the great sea kingdom in the future.</p>
<p>It must be nipped in the bud. 3 days later, the education department and immigration department of the great Sia Kingdom jointly issued an announcement joint operation to thoroughly clean up and rectify the situation of foreign nationals staying in the country. Chapter 110, a complete cleanup. The moment the announcement was issued, the entire internet is in an uproar. It wasn&#x27;t panic, it was boiling over.</p>
<p>In the comments section, the emotions of netzens on Da were like oil poured on a fire. They finally made their move. How many years have we waited for this day? Well done. Good job cracking down on this. Support the country.</p>
<p>We will never allow unhealthy trends and evil practices to pollute great SIA. Even retired veterans posted videos. In the video, the old man is holding up his old medal. The voice was horsearo but powerful. The country did the right thing.</p>
<p>I support it. Please like, comment, and share separately below the video. But amidst the cheers, some people have also stood up to oppose it. A bunch of people echoed this sentiment. Exactly.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t we looking to recruit a lot of talent? We should accept it all. The craziest one is the little black book. Many of the posts are extremely offensive. These posts are just starting out. The cyber police acted faster than lightning.</p>
<p>An apartment in Beijing. When there was a knock on the door, the blogger is still typing. The moment the door opened, the security guards simply showed their credentials. Lie Ming Mang because of Lie Mungmings face turned pale instantly and she started throwing a tantrum. I haven&#x27;t broken the law.</p>
<p>What right do you have to arrest me? Upon hearing this, the security guard said coldly, &quot;You&#x27;ll be able to tell me what&#x27;s on your mind later.&quot; The moment the handcuffs were put on, she fell silent. His face was filled with despair. At the same time, little black book headquarters. The police lights illuminated the building in bright red. Staff from several departments filed in to conduct a joint investigation.</p>
<p>The server was seized on the spot. In the executive&#x27;s office, CEO Jeangi is still making phone calls to plead for leniency. I&#x27;ll delete the post right away. Please have mercy. The policeman grabbed the phone.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s too late. The platform has long tolerated inappropriate speech and protected illegal content. As the person in charge, you will face legal sanctions. That afternoon, official announcement. Xrohishu has been permanently banned and all key executives have been detained.</p>
<p>The news has spread. Netzens applauded. That&#x27;s satisfying. This kind of platform should have been shut down long ago. Let them know that the great Sia&#x27;s internet is not a lawless zone.</p>
<p>Well done. The action was more thorough than imagined. No one sympathizes with her. Someone is taking pictures with their phone. A girl in a school uniform shouted, &quot;When you were harassing your classmates, did you ever think about today?&quot; They want to refute this.</p>
<p>Staff members stepped forward. He was holding a document in his hand. You have broken the law. Home. Do you deserve that? Then he was taken away immediately.</p>
<p>The elderly people watching clapped their hands. Good for him. He&#x27;s the one who stole the neighbors package before. They finally caught them. The most severely affected city is Guang Fu City.</p>
<p>A large number of security personnel were deployed to conduct a thorough cleanup of the entire city. Some wanted to hide. They were all raised by the surrounding people. On the other side, the cargo ship was already waiting. The deck was packed with people.</p>
<p>At this moment, fear finally gripped me. They no longer dared to be arrogant. The moment the cargo ship sounded its horn. The riverbank was crowded with onlookers. Some people set off firecrackers as if celebrating a victory.</p>
<p>At the same time, the working group moved indirectly. Upon checking the ledgers, they were full of problems. That day the management teams of more than a dozen universities. They were taken away for investigation overnight. The news has spread in the students parents group chat.</p>
<p>All the news was heartening. The people all applauded and cheered. The news reached the international community. The international forum instantly erupted in excitement. The screen was filled with criticism.</p>
<p>What is the great Sia kingdom doing? Why do this? I don&#x27;t understand. Media outlets in several countries have reported on this. More directly, it&#x27;s the black state. Embassy of the United States in China, South Black State. They submitted a protest note directly.</p>
<p>A diplomatic official slammed his fist on the table and shouted at a press conference. We will take counter measures. They even threatened the great SA kingdom with its investments in Hou to force it to apologize. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Eagle Optin looked at the protest reports. He was laughing very happily.</p>
<p>Okay, let them make a scene. It would be best to make a big scene. Only in this way will we have a chance. Chapter 111. Black State&#x27;s national counterattack.</p>
<p>Instant kneeling. The presidential office of the Republic of South Africa. President Ober slammed his fist on the table and issued orders. Notify the authorities back home immediately. Freeze all of the great SA kingdoms mineral assets in the southern black kingdom.</p>
<p>And all the roads and hospitals they helped build have been suspended. His eyes were fierce, as if he had found the weak spot of the great Sia Kingdom. The aid beside him hesitated. Mr. President, wouldn&#x27;t this? What are you afraid of? The official interrupted him.</p>
<p>We all the black states are together. If the great Sa Kingdom dares to retaliate, it can forget about our mineral resources. At the same time, outside a large factory in a certain black state, a crowd blocked the gate, holding up makeshift signs. Get out of our land. You&#x27;re not allowed to make money off us.</p>
<p>Several burly men attempted to break through the factory fence, but security guards held them back. The Chinese workers in the factory clenched their fists. Those damn bastards without us investing in building the factory. They&#x27;re still living like people from a primitive society. How despicable.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re all ingrates. Although the Chinese employees were angry, they dared not rush out. They knew that this was an action tacitly approved by the local authorities. Another port in the black state. Customs officials led a group of people onto the cargo ship of the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>Open the container. We need to inspect it. The crew member frowned. We have all the necessary paperwork. The paperwork is useless.</p>
<p>The official kicked the shipping container. Now I&#x27;m in charge. The cargo ship captain immediately contacted his home country. His voice tense. They&#x27;ve made their move in black state requesting instructions.</p>
<p>Various countries in the black region spread like a virus. Some of them froze the accounts of Dashia enterprise. Some drove away the construction workers. Some even smashed up shops in the great sea kingdom. International media outlets rushed to report on it.</p>
<p>The headlines were all black states unite to counter great sea of a certain country in black state even made the following statement at a press conference. The great sea kingdom must apologize otherwise we will make sure they have no place to stand in Hjo. Just when the state of black was acting arrogantly and doineeringly, a red announcement suddenly popped up on the official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Great Sa Kingdom. There was no unnecessary buildup, only a chilling warning to all nations of Halongjiang. All assets of the Great Sea Kingdom and Hilong Xiang are legitimate investments and aid projects protected by international law.</p>
<p>If any country dares to touch Great Sas assets, they should first consider the consequences for Japan. The great SA dynasty never provokes trouble, but it never hesitates to take a hard line against threats. You have 1 hour to restore order, otherwise you will bear the consequences. The announcement release time is accurate to the second. It doesn&#x27;t contain lengthy explanations, yet it carries immense weight.</p>
<p>Inside the presidential palace of the southern black kingdom, was pleased with himself as he watched their countermeasures. The secretary suddenly rushed in holding a cell phone. President, a proclamation from the great Sia Kingdom. The president glanced at it and his face instantly turned pale. He suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>Not long ago, nuclear power plants and power plants in Japan disappeared one by one. And that Yasakuni toilet, not even a trace was left. Withdraw. Immediately withdraw all countermeasure orders. Quick, unblock the great Sia Enterprises accounts.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be too late if we wait. And discuss with their manager about compensating them for their losses. Yes. The order was quickly relayed to all departments. On the other side, the crowd that surrounded the Dasha factory.</p>
<p>Suddenly, military police rushed over carrying megaphones. Everyone disperse immediately. That&#x27;s an order. The guy who had been leading the clamor was now shrinking back. Some people were puzzled.</p>
<p>Were we told to surround and blockade them? The military police glared at him. Shut up if you don&#x27;t want to die. The crowd scattered instantly, and no one dared to linger. customs officials at the port. I had just opened a shipping container when I received a call from my superior.</p>
<p>Release the boat immediately. Apologize to them. But sir, we haven&#x27;t. No buts, the superior roared. Do you want our port to disappear like the power plants in Japan? The officials hand trembled and he quickly waved his hand.</p>
<p>Quick, release the boat. Apologized to the captain. The crew looked at the official whose expression had suddenly changed, their eyes filled with disdain. Less than an hour, the countries in the black region have come to a halt. The frozen accounts were restored, the crowds dispersed, and the suspended aid projects were restarted.</p>
<p>A certain black country even took the initiative to contact the embassy of the great Sia Kingdom, speaking in a humble tone. It&#x27;s all a misunderstanding. We will correct it immediately. At the international forum, nizens were utterly disappointed. This reversal happened way too fast.</p>
<p>The black state was shouting loudly just now and now they&#x27;ve backed down in an instant. That announcement from the great SA kingdom was a bombshell. Who wouldn&#x27;t be afraid of Japan when it comes to Japan? An American nizen commented, &quot;I thought black states could hold out for a while, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so easily frightened.&quot; South Korean nizens, haha, this is what happens when you mess with the great sea kingdom. Black state is still too young. Within the great sea kingdom, nizens were immediately in an uproar.</p>
<p>The top 10 trending topics on Weibo are all in red. Great Sia&#x27;s announcement scared off the outbreak in various black countries. Japan, in the end, I bore the brunt of all the heat. National power. Boiling point.</p>
<p>The comment section was filled with cheers. Haha. This national announcement is so powerful. One sentence is worth a thousand. Black State nation, I was incredibly brave just now.</p>
<p>After seeing the announcement, I was wrong. Japan. So, I&#x27;m just a warning template. Support the nation. Anyone who dares to mess with us will be reminded of the consequences of the Japanese invasion.</p>
<p>A retired veteran sent a video. Great. This is what the great Sia Kingdom should look like. A residential community in Beijing. Elderly people gathered around the screen in the square dancing area, clapping and cheering as they read the announcement.</p>
<p>The country is truly powerful. They were intimidated with just one sentence. I was worried about my compatriots in black state before, but now I&#x27;m relieved. The people of the entire great sea kingdom once again witnessed the benefits brought by a strong nation. Across the Pacific Ocean inside the White House in the US, Opton was sitting on the sofa leisurely sipping his coffee.</p>
<p>He smiled smugly as he read the news of the state s counter measures. Okay, let&#x27;s keep making a scene like this. It would be best to make the great SA kingdom unable to attend to one thing at a time. Just then, the secretary rushed in flustered. Mr.</p>
<p>President, something terrible has happened. The black state has completely stopped. What did you say? Optin was stunned. He snatched the tablet from his secretary&#x27;s hand. I saw the announcement from the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>Then I saw news of the withdrawal of troops from the black countries. The smile on his face vanished instantly, replaced by a silent stillness. The words fruit of the cherry blossom country on the tablet were so glaring. Optin&#x27;s eyes darkened and he sighed. The great sia kingdom is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>We need to increase investment otherwise we will be far surpassed by the great sia kingdom. The prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan. Kishaurro was sitting in his office when he came across an announcement from the great sia kingdom. Veins bulged on his forehead as he roared. Baka, the great Sa Kingdom is actually using us as a warning example.</p>
<p>They use our shame as a tool to threaten others. He swept the teacup off the table. The sound of the porcelain shattering was jarring. The secretary outside the door was trembling. I didn&#x27;t dare go in at all for fear of being caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>A moment later, Jurro Kishida took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. He dialed Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s number. The progress of the biowarriors must be accelerated. And there&#x27;s also bacteria.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there&#x27;s a way to control it, mass-produce it immediately. Hi, hang up the phone. Kisha Jurro walked to the window, looked at the distant scenery, and said in a cold voice, &quot;Great Kingdom, you just wait. This time, I&#x27;m going to let you taste the consequences that are even more terrible than a power outage.&quot; Chapter 112. Controlled nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>The entire planet Earth has once again increased its investment in weapons and equipment as well as space technology research and development. Everyone wants to catch up with the great sea kingdom. They did not want to remain behind the Great Sea Kingdom. Countries around the world are like spinning tops that have been whipped, pushing themselves forward with all their might. But they didn&#x27;t know the pace of the Great Sea Kingdom has long been beyond their reach.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom. The last batch of illegally detained individuals were loaded onto the cargo ship. The cleanup operation has been completely completed. Siakiuan Lie Jian Guo holding the report walked into Lin Chin&#x27;s office. Kobayashi, that&#x27;s all cleared out.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t disappoint you this time, did I? Lynch nodded. Mr. Lee, I am very satisfied with this result. The country is capable of achieving this level. Already very good.</p>
<p>After all, there&#x27;s the risk of offending those black states. If a country does not have strong power, the consequences of this cleanup operation will certainly be far more complex than they appear. Lynchin made this suggestion initially. It was a well-thoughtout decision, not made on a whim. Black countries are all timid and cowardly.</p>
<p>As long as they have enough strength and a firm enough attitude, they will definitely not dare to cause trouble. This is the best proof. Seeing Lynchin&#x27;s reaction, Lie Jian Guo immediately breathed the sigh of relief. Then he spoke again. Shaolin, the production line for the White Emperor space fighter has begun to be upgraded.</p>
<p>Mass production is expected to begin in 1 month. That&#x27;s pretty fast. Lynchin was a little surprised. Lie Jian Guo laughed and said, &quot;That&#x27;s right. The military is pressing us hard, so they&#x27;ll give us whatever we need.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll definitely be fast. Excellent. Once the White Emperor is mass-produced, our national defense will take another leap forward.&quot; Lynch was very satisfied with this speed. As long as Bid completes its mass production deployment on the entire planet Earth, the great SEA kingdom has no rivals. Even if the US unites with all the countries, it won&#x27;t make a difference.</p>
<p>Faced with absolute power, they are all paper tigers. Then Lynchin shared another piece of good news. Oldly the Kuaning space plane has entered the assembly stage and it is estimated that it will be completed ahead of schedule. Really? That&#x27;s great. Li Jang Guoo immediately became excited.</p>
<p>now will definitely be the first country to land a man on the moon. Once the Kuan Ping space plain&#x27;s maiden flight is successful, the Great Sea Kingdom will officially enter the space age. Developing lunar resources is just around the corner. At that time, the Great Sa Kingdom will no longer have to worry about resource issues. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>The moon will definitely belong to our great Sia Kingdom. No one can change anything. Lynchin&#x27;s tone was full of doineering power. It&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re asserting sovereignty over the moon. Well said.</p>
<p>Huh? Lie Jian Guoo laughed heartily. The moon can only belong to our great Sia kingdom. Not just the moon, but Mars. The entire solar system will belong to our great Sea Kingdom in the future. Lynch&#x27;s eyes were full of confidence.</p>
<p>How could the moon alone be enough to support the Great Sea Kingdoms interstellar journey? They definitely want to take all the resources of the entire solar system into their own hands. Only in this way can the great SA kingdom have enough resources to advance its technological development. Thus began the great interstellar voyage. However, that&#x27;s a story for another time. The first priority now is to ensure the successful maiden flight of the Kuing Space plane.</p>
<p>Then they began constructing the lunar research institute. Everything must be done step by step. Next, the two of them discussed the progress of the Kuing space plane project. Li Jang Wo left in a huff night. Lynchan entered the inheritance space as usual.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the inheritors for completing the technology transfer of the Kuanping space plane. Please select the next option, technological inheritance. Great. The time has been reduced significantly. Lynch was a little excited when he heard the notification sound from the inheritance space because it has the technological foundation inherited from the body aerospace fighter jet.</p>
<p>The technological transfer of the Kuping space plane was completed in just over 10 days. New technological inheritance. He had already made up his mind. I choose controlled nuclear fusion. Selection confirmed.</p>
<p>Inheritance begins. The mechanical sound faded away. Countless data streams flooded into Lin Chen&#x27;s mind. Controlled nuclear fusion simulating the fusion reaction inside the sun. Dutyium and tridium were confined in a vacuum chamber using a superconducting magnetic confinement device.</p>
<p>The temperature is 150 million degrees C which is three times higher than the core of the sun. Under high pressure, atomic nuclei overcome repulsion and collide to form helium nuclei releasing enormous energy in the process. Safer than nuclear fishision with virtually zero contamination. The energy from 1 gram of dutyium tridium fusion is equivalent to 8 tons of gasoline. This is the real energy revolution.</p>
<p>Lynch looked at the various data, his eyes filled with excitement. With controlled nuclear fusion technology, the energy problem for the lunar base has finally been solved. Controlled nuclear fusion has been achieved. Not to mention the lunar base. It&#x27;s more than enough to power even the Nanchamin space city.</p>
<p>After receiving the technical instruction, Lin Shan then began to busy himself in the Heritage Space Laboratory. He wants to manually create controlled nuclear fusion. On the one hand, the process parameters were optimized to be the easiest to achieve in the Great Sea Kingdom. Let&#x27;s start with the materials. The controlled nuclear fusion vacuum chamber uses a new type of tungsten steel alloy.</p>
<p>It can withstand temperatures of 200 million° C. Awesome. Looking at the parameters, Lynn Shawn was shocked. Then he began to experiment according to the formula parameters. It continued until the next morning.</p>
<p>Lynn Shankai left the inheritance space with a sense of unfinished business. The materials issue has been resolved. The next step is to solve the ignition problem. One night, he optimized the materials perfectly and successfully manufactured it. The space has been subtly transformed over this period of time.</p>
<p>His physical and mental abilities have been greatly enhanced. The speed at which knowledge is being passed down is also much faster than before. This is the benefit that the space for inheritance brings him. Lynchin quickly washed up and ate breakfast. Head over to the Siakiuan Kuing Space Blane assembly base.</p>
<p>On the other side, the great Sia Kingdom Astronaut Training Center. The atmosphere, however, was somewhat oppressive. Sai, it&#x27;s been 2 months and there&#x27;s still no new information. It seems like our dream of going to space is going to be difficult. Old Jang side.</p>
<p>He was a veteran astronaut, 48 years old this year, and had been to the space station twice. Who says otherwise? Even the space fighter has successfully completed its test flight. They probably don&#x27;t need us anymore. Shia Wong, standing nearby, was filled with resentment. He is 28 years old and trains the hardest.</p>
<p>I hope that one day I can become one of the astronauts to go to the space station. According to the plan, he will have the opportunity to go to the space station this year. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no hope in sight now. The other astronauts all looked disappointed. Sudden the phone on my desk rang.</p>
<p>Old Jang answered the call slowly. Hello, training center. What did you say? A moon landing? Are we the first batch of candidates? A meeting in half an hour? Okay, okay, I&#x27;ll send someone over right away. Old Jang jumped to his feet and excitedly addressed Xiao Wong and the others. Comrades, we may be going to land on the moon.</p>
<p>Get to the meeting room immediately for a meeting. The surrounding astronauts were stunned for a moment, then cheered. Wow, a moon landing. That&#x27;s way too fast. Wow, this day has finally come.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so great. Come on, someone slapped me awake. See if I&#x27;m dreaming. Looking at the excited astronauts, old Jang was also very happy. All right, let&#x27;s go to the meeting.</p>
<p>Well know the truth after the meeting. All the astronauts nodded frantically. Okay, let&#x27;s go now. Chapter 113. That man has arrived.</p>
<p>The lights in the conference room of the astronaut training center were blindingly bright. Old Jang sat in the first row, his eyes filled with excitement. Shia Wong stood beside him, his eyes filled with hope. The other astronauts all had their eyes fixed on the door, eagerly waiting while everyone waited. The moment the door was pushed open, everyone&#x27;s attention was instantly drawn to it.</p>
<p>Engineer Wong from the Seyako Institute walked in carrying a computer and a file folder. Wong Gong sat in the main seat, looked at the astronauts, and began to speak. Everyone, before we start the meeting, please sign this confidentiality agreement. Jang, help distribute them. Okay, engineer Wong.</p>
<p>Olang quickly got up, took the confidentiality agreements, and distributed them. Without the slightest hesitation, all the astronauts signed their names. Even glance at the content. For them, all they care about is flying to the moon. Even if the country sells them out, it&#x27;s worth it.</p>
<p>The confidentiality agreement was signed quickly. After glancing at it and confirming that nothing had been missed, engineer Wong smiled and said, &quot;Congratulations, everyone. I will soon become one of the first astronauts to land on the moon.&quot; The words had barely left his mouth. Shiao Wong and the others instantly became excited. Is it true? Can we really fly to the moon? How long is soon? Is it half a year? Looking at the excited crowd, engineer Wong waved his hand.</p>
<p>The news is true. The maiden flight is expected to take place at the end of the month. Therefore, you don&#x27;t have much time left to train. The maiden flight at the end of the month. Old Jang jumped up excitedly, his face filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s too fast. Shia Wong and the others were also completely dumbfounded. There are less than 20 days left until the end of the month. Is such a short time enough now? They&#x27;re actually a little worried that they won&#x27;t be able to complete the training. Seeing their concern, engineer Wong continued, &quot;The time will only be brought forward.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have a special program for your short-term training plan. Make sure you meet the basic requirements for flying to the moon.&quot; Old Jang and Shia Wong breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this. Then, Engineer Wong continued, &quot;For this maiden flight mission, you need to successfully land on the moon. You&#x27;ll have 2 hours to collect samples and conduct surveys. We will stay for 2 hours to complete soil sampling and then return.</p>
<p>The entire process must be completed within 30 hours. The words had barely left his mouth. Jean suddenly stood up. Engineer Wong, you mean a round trip to the moon within 30 hours. His voice trembled and his eyes widened.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been to the space station twice in my life. He knows best the difficulties of space travel. Previously, it took two days to go to and from the space station. It&#x27;s now possible to go to the moon in just one day. Engineer Wong nodded and brought up the Kuan Pung&#x27;s parameter panel.</p>
<p>The Kuening has an empty weight of 75 tons, a maximum payload of 500 tons, and a maximum speed of Mach 60. The straight line distance from Earth to the moon is 380,000 km. This speed is more than enough. Shia Wong suddenly clenched his fist, his voice excited. So, we can really set foot on the moon.</p>
<p>He was 28 years old and had been training for two and a half years, just waiting for an opportunity to go to space. I thought there was no hope. Now, the idea of actually landing on the moon is hard to believe. Engineer Wong smiled and pointed to the five-star red flag pattern on the screen. Not only can we step on it, but we also want to plant this flag on the moon.</p>
<p>Moreover, this moon landing will be broadcast live in its entirety. Everyone on the planet Earth will be watching you represent the great Sia kingdom and set foot on the moon. Boom. The meeting room erupted in chaos. Old Jeang wiped his face, but he still couldn&#x27;t hold back his tears.</p>
<p>Great. Great. Comrades, I can go to the moon. Shia Wong and the others were so excited they couldn&#x27;t speak. Not long after accommodation for the conference, old Jang and the others immediately entered the intense training phase.</p>
<p>The main purpose is training to simulate actions in the lunar environment. 10 days later, Siaki Yuen Linshen&#x27;s office. After he pressed the final confirmation key on the keyboard, I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally finished these 10 days. He spends a little time each day checking on the progress of the Kimping space plane.</p>
<p>They have experience in developing the bitey aerospace fighter jet. The Kimping space plane went very smoothly and he doesn&#x27;t need to pay too much attention to it. He spent the rest of his time in the office writing out the technical solution for controlled nuclear fusion. Evenings were spent in the heritage space conducting various experiments and optimizing solutions. From material parameters to energy output models, every piece of data was repeatedly checked.</p>
<p>10 days passed in the blink of an eye. Today, the technical solution was finally completed. He took his laptop and went straight to Lie Jang Wos office. When Lie Jian Guo saw Lynchin come in with a computer, he was instantly a little excited. Kobayashi, is there some new technology again? He knows Linshin too well.</p>
<p>Just bring your computer. There must be some new technology involved. Lynchan sat down and smiled. Old Lee, you&#x27;ve caught me again. There really is.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo was a little surprised. Lynchan nodded. Mr. Lee, take a look. This is my new technology solution.</p>
<p>After saying that, Lynchin opened the computer and handed it to Li Jang Guoo. Li Jian Guo took the computer and looked at it. Instantly, my eyes widened. Controlled nuclear fusion technology solution. He turned to look at Lynchun.</p>
<p>Are you sure? Lynch nodded emphatically. After receiving confirmation, Lie Jian Guo focused his attention on the text on the computer. As he continued to flip through the pages, his facial expressions also began to become more interesting. It&#x27;s even faster than the face-changing act in Sichuan opera. Piss.</p>
<p>Every now and then, I would gasp in shock. After a long time, Lie Jian Guo looked away from the computer. He looked at Lyn Shan with disbelief. Kobayashi, this this can really be made. Lynch nodded, smiling confidently, and said, &quot;Definitely.</p>
<p>Wait until the research and development is successful. The energy problem can be solved at the lunar base. Even the energy supply for the subsequent Nanchiman space city will not be a problem. Lie Jian Guo instantly became excited. Salin, I&#x27;ll go report right now.</p>
<p>Wait until I get back, then immediately convene a project initiation meeting with the relevant personnel. After saying that, he started making phone calls to report to his superiors. Not long after, Lie Jian Guo then hung up the phone. Shaolin, the higher-ups have approved it. Go back and get ready.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll gather the relevant personnel right now. I will notify you of the specific meeting time later. Okay. Lynshan nodded slightly then went back to prepare. The next day, nuclear energy technical experts from all over the country were summoned to the Shaman Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>In the large conference room of the Xiaku Academy, the experts who came from all over the country were completely bewildered. Old Wong, you&#x27;ve been called here too. Do you know what kind of meeting it is? An expert nudged Old Wong, who looked equally puzzled, and asked. Old Wong shook his head and lowered his voice, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; I was suddenly notified that there was a major project to be discussed, and I was starting to have some doubts. The technical experts who had come from other parts of the conference room were completely baffled.</p>
<p>Only the technical experts from the Seyaku Academy were filled with excitement. Their eyes were all fixed on the conference room door. It was as if she was waiting for that man to arrive. Chapter 1,4 Infinite Energy. Just when those experts were wondering, the conference room door was suddenly pushed open.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to them. Lie Jian Guo and Lynchin walked in. Upon seeing Lynchin appear, the experts from the Sia Academy of Sciences instantly became excited. Is it really Chief Engineer Lynn? It&#x27;s all set. We can participate in a new project again.</p>
<p>They were very clear about it. As long as Linshin attends this kind of meeting, there must be a new and important technology project being initiated. The experts from other places, however, looked puzzled. Who is the young man next to Dean Lee? Could it be Dean Lee&#x27;s assistant? Professor Wong, the expert, was full of curiosity. He is a leading figure in the field of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>He was completely baffled by this emergency summits. Judging from the reactions of the experts from the Sia Academy of Sciences, things are definitely not simple. Other original experts across the country reacted in the same way. Everyone was curious about Lin Chen&#x27;s identity. In their anticipation and curiosity, Lie Jian Guo walked to the podium and slowly began to speak.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, everyone must sign a top secret confidentiality agreement. The words had barely left his mouth. The experts from other places were stunned for a moment. Top secret confidentiality agreement. What exactly was the agenda for this meeting? The experts and professors who had come from all over the country were shocked.</p>
<p>this level of confidentiality agreement. This means that these are technologies that concern the fate of the nation. After the initial shock, no one hesitated. He took the agreement and quickly signed his name. The scratching sound of the pen tip gliding across the paper was particularly clear in the conference room.</p>
<p>In contrast, the experts andmissians of the Sia Academy of Sciences were full of excitement. It&#x27;s safe. They signed faster than anyone else. Soon, everyone signed the confidentiality agreement. After the staff checked and found no problems, &quot;Dean, no problem.&quot; Lie Jian Guo nodded and continued, &quot;There is only one purpose for calling this meeting today.</p>
<p>We are here to discuss the complete plan for controlled nuclear fusion technology proposed by Comrade Lin Chun.&quot; Boom! The meeting room erupted in chaos. Everyone was completely dumbfounded. Professor Wong stood up and questioned directly, &quot;A complete plan for controlled nuclear fusion? How is that possible? He has been engaged in nuclear energy research for 40 years and knows best the difficulty of this technology. The US and the polar bear have been studying each other for decades, but their research has only reached the experimental stage. The great SEA kingdom is also researching controlled nuclear fusion and it is at the forefront of the world but it&#x27;s still in the theoretical stage.</p>
<p>Now you say you have a complete plan. How is that possible? Experts from other regions also expressed skepticism. Only the experts at the Seyaku Academy seem to have anticipated this. There is a complete controlled nuclear fusion program. Once it&#x27;s achieved, the entire energy system of Earth will be revolutionized.</p>
<p>It will bring about earthshattering changes to the great Sia Kingdom. They suppressed their excitement and turned their gaze to Lynch. They were just waiting for Lynchin to speak. Lie Jian Guo smiled when he heard their doubts. Next, comrade Lynch will introduce the specific technical parameters to you.</p>
<p>After saying that, he gestured for Linshan to come forward. The experts and professors from other places were instantly dumbfounded. The entire controlled nuclear fusion scheme already seemed outrageous to them, but it was written by someone even younger than their students. This is outrageous. While they were stunned, Lyn Shan went up to the podium, turned on his computer, and projected the plan onto the screen.</p>
<p>Hello everyone. Next, I will explain the complete technology scheme for controlled nuclear fusion. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them here. He paused for a moment, then continued his explanation. I won&#x27;t go into the details of the principles of controlled nuclear fusion here as everyone here is an expert in the field.</p>
<p>Next, I will introduce the technical implementation plant. According to the design, controlled nuclear fusion uses a superconducting magnetic confinement device. It uses a new type of tungsten steel alloy for the vacuum chamber which can withstand a temperature of 200 million degrees C. The fuel uses dutyium and tridium. 1 g of it releases the same amount of energy as 8 tons of gasoline.</p>
<p>The moment the words were spoken, the experts from other places erupted in uproar. What a material that can withstand 200 million° C? Can the constraints of dutyium tridium fusion really be resolved? Questions and criticisms arose. one after another. They even felt that the plan was more like science fiction and not feasible at all. Lynchin didn&#x27;t pay any attention to their questions.</p>
<p>He directly opened the relevant technical parameter data. The data charts are clearly displayed on the screen. Precise experimental parameters, simulation results, and material test reports are all presented. Everyone, please just look at the technical specifications report on the screen. Lines of precise data scroll by.</p>
<p>The meeting room fell silent instantly. The initial doubts vanished immediately. The experts couldn&#x27;t help but stand up and walk in front of the big screen. His eyes were fixed on the parameters on the screen. This this data, it&#x27;s so realistic.</p>
<p>Has the experiment already been conducted? In all their years of research, they had never seen such perfect experimental data. The previous doubts were instantly overturned. As the explanation went deeper, Lynchin started by discussing material formulations and then moved on to energy output models. Then there&#x27;s the design of the ignition device. Experts performed Sichuan opera face-changing life.</p>
<p>From initial skepticism to shock and finally to numbness. Expertly rubbed his eyes and pinched himself. It hurts. It&#x27;s not a dream. He looked at the plan on the screen, his voice trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>With this technology, our great Sia will rewrite the energy landscape. Academician Jangs voice choked with emotion. Yes, if this were to actually be realized, the entire world&#x27;s energy landscape would be rewritten. Professor Wong walked up to Lyn Shun, filled with shame. Comrade Lynshan, I&#x27;m impressed.</p>
<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have questioned you. Your plan is a true national strategic asset. The other experts from other places looked at Lyn Shan with nothing but admiration and respect. This is hardly a young person. This is the leader who can guide the great Sia Kingdom into a new era.</p>
<p>Lynchin quickly waved his hand and said modestly, &quot;You flatter me, seniors. I only did some integration work,&quot; &quot;The realization of controlled nuclear fusion technology is inseparable from the solid foundation laid by our predecessors.&quot; Looking at the scene before him, Lie Jian Guo announced directly. Since everyone agrees with the plan, we will now make an announcement. The Ling Long project has been officially established. Goal to build the first controlled nuclear fusion experimental reactor within 3 months.</p>
<p>All resources will be prioritized for supply. Everyone must give it your all. We must succeed. Yes. All the experts responded in unison.</p>
<p>A burning light shone in everyone&#x27;s eyes. They know. From this day forward, a new chapter will be turned in the energy history of the great SA kingdom. Lynchin nodded slightly as he looked at everyone. Controlled nuclear fusion is only the first step.</p>
<p>Waiting for the experimental reactor to succeed. Then we can begin building the lunar base. Later on, there&#x27;s the Nanchiman space city interstellar warships. The blueprint for a bright future is being realized step by step. Chapter 115.</p>
<p>Kuings first flight. 10 days later, Siaki Yuan Kuing Space Blane assembly base. The silver fuselov stood silently on the tarmac. With a length of 95 m and a wingspan of 75 m, it resembles a dormant coing. The alloy coating on the fuselage surface has a futuristic look under the sunlight.</p>
<p>All the engineers were filled with excitement as they looked at the Kuan Ping space plane before them. Finally finished, huh? We assembled the Kuenping space plane in less than a month. Chief designer Lynn is truly amazing. The technical solution he provided was incredibly detailed. Who could have imagined that it would happen in less than a month? They started from scratch and built the Kuening space plane directly.</p>
<p>Unlike previous large aircraft projects which often took several years or even 10 years to complete, that speed is simply divine. Lie Jian Guoo stood to the side, his eyes filled with excitement. Kobayashi, you&#x27;ve created another miracle. Lynchan smiled and said, &quot;It&#x27;s all thanks to everyone. This time, the coimping space plane.&quot; He participated for the least amount of time.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re almost all busy with controlled nuclear fusion. It was able to be manufactured so quickly. It&#x27;s all thanks to those engineers working overtime day and night. He only solved some of the technical problems. The engineers are the ones who truly put in the effort.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo patted Lyn Shan on the shoulder. Kobayashi, the first flight test is about to begin. If we&#x27;re confident, let&#x27;s do a global live stream this time. Sure, Lynn Chin had no objections. He has full confidence in the Kuing Space plane.</p>
<p>Every step of the assembly process was repeatedly checked by the engineers. Assembly must be carried out strictly in accordance with the process specifications. Furthermore, the Kimping space plane has a self- testing system. All problems can be detected. Make sure every takeoff is in peak condition.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;ll have someone issue an announcement right away. We&#x27;ll conduct final checks today and the maiden flight will be broadcast live tomorrow morning. Li Jian Guo made the decision directly. Lynchian nodded and instructed the engineers to conduct a final check. Then they left for the controlled nuclear fusion project team.</p>
<p>Soon the great SIA kingdom publicly issued an announcement. The Kimping space plane will conduct its maiden flight tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. Live broadcast worldwide. Goal: land on the moon. The announcement was released.</p>
<p>The entire Great Sea Kingdom instantly erupted in excitement. First is the astronaut training center. The astronauts were instantly excited upon hearing the news. Haha, it&#x27;s finally here. Wow, the maiden flight will be broadcast live globally tomorrow.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m so nervous. I&#x27;m so afraid I haven&#x27;t trained well. Shia Wong touched the national flag emblem on his space suit and his eyes suddenly welled up with tears. Am I really going to go to the moon and it&#x27;ll be broadcast live worldwide? Old Jang nodded emphatically and patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Once the maiden flight is successful, we ll be able to carry this flag and set foot on the moon. Let the whole world see that the moon belongs to our great Sia kingdom. Everyone&#x27;s eyes were filled with anticipation. Everyone go and do your final training.</p>
<p>Get in top form and get ready for tomorrow&#x27;s maiden flight. Good. At the same time, the announcement immediately topped the trending searches online. Kuings maiden flight explodes. Dasha is going to send people to the moon.</p>
<p>Global live stream of Kuan&#x27;s maiden flight sparks excitement. In the comments section, nizens from the great SEA Kingdom were completely excited. Holy crap, how long has it been since the maiden flight of the space fighter jet? And now the Kuaning space plane is making its maiden flight. Is the country on a roll? Sending people to the moon in just one month. Outrageous.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s definitely a cheater involved, huh? It feels like our great Sia Kingdom is starting to resemble the protagonist of a wish fulfillment novel. Discussions could be heard everywhere from street corners to alleyways. We are full of anticipation for the kuing spacecraft&#x27;s manned lunar landing. At the same time, everyone wants to know, did the United States actually managed to land a man on the moon back then, or is it a century old lie they themselves fabricated? At the international forum, nizens from various countries were completely dumbfounded. Oh my god, the great sea kingdom is going to send people to the moon.</p>
<p>The technological speed of the great SIA is too fast. Our space station is not even finished being upgraded yet. Damn it. This This can&#x27;t be stealing our technology, can it? Has the Great Sa Kingdom gone mad? They actually want to send people to the moon. Will it just explode tomorrow? International forums are buzzing with discussion.</p>
<p>There were doubts, but more than anything, there was shock and anticipation. The scene of BY destroying Starlink satellites during its maiden flight is still fresh in everyone&#x27;s minds. Now that the great sea kingdom has introduced the konping, everyone wants to see if the great sea kingdom can really send people to the moon. The white house of the US optin stared at the announcement on the screen, his brow furrowed. Is the great sea kingdom about to send people to the moon and it has to be streamed globally? This is not good news for the US.</p>
<p>They originally thought their starship was progressing very quickly. Unexpectedly, the great Sia Kingdom was even faster. &quot;President, are we going to stir up trouble again this time?&quot; the secretary asked in a low voice. &quot;Idiot.&quot; Oppen glared at his secretary. Wasn&#x27;t the lesson learned last time enough? &quot;The great Sia Kingdom of today is no longer something that can be dealt with using such inferior methods.</p>
<p>Only by working hard to research and develop and catch up can we avoid being left behind.&quot; He now has a deep understanding of the power of the great Sia Kingdom. They certainly won&#x27;t target the Great Sea Kingdom recklessly like before. They want to maintain their current position. The only solution is to massively increase investment in research and development. He simply didn&#x27;t believe that their Hawk Alliance had so many scientists.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t even compare to the scientific research talent of the Great Sa Kingdom. Then Upton continued to instruct his secretary. Go and inform Durit to expedite the second maiden flight of the starship. Remember, we must never make the same basic mistake again. This time, we don&#x27;t need to fly to the moon.</p>
<p>We only need to complete the maiden flight into near-earth space. Yes, Mr. President. The prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan. Kisha Jurro looked at the announcement, his face terribly grim.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom. Damn it. It&#x27;s only been a short time and they&#x27;re already planning to send people to the moon. thinking of the current dire state of their Sakura country. Now look at the glory of the great Sia kingdom.</p>
<p>Kishidajurro felt worse than if he had eaten a dead fly. Although a month of emergency repairs were carried out. However, only power has been restored to some cities. Production still cannot be resumed. Many areas are without power.</p>
<p>In particular, they want to import solar power and diesel generators. Prices abroad have skyrocketed. Prices start at 10 times the original price. Even so, they had no choice but to grit their teeth and buy it. But Kisha Jiurro kept all those countries in his little notebook, waiting for that bacteria to be mass-produced.</p>
<p>He must get revenge. The thought of the great Sia Kingdom about to land on the moon is very gratifying. Kishaurro felt a pang of sadness. No, we have to speed it up. He called Dr.</p>
<p>Kawashima directly. He was ordered to speed up the production of bacteria. Chapter 116 India Great Sia Expedition. We can do it too, India. The prime minister&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>Demo the immortal stared at the announcement from the great Sia Kingdom on the screen. His complexion looked rather unpleasant. Damn it. The Great Sea Kingdom beat us to it again. Thinking about their country&#x27;s progress in man space flight.</p>
<p>He was immediately furious. A bunch of useless trash. Our man rocket has been under development for 5 years. They haven&#x27;t even broken through to near-earth orbit yet. The secretary cautiously explained.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, our space technology development started late. So shut up, old immortal demo roared. So what if we started developing late? We have faith. We are protected by the sacred cow. Pass the word down immediately.</p>
<p>A man space flight must take place in one week. We must send people out of Earth. As for the consequences, he didn&#x27;t care at all. They&#x27;ll win as long as they can fly out of Earth. Upon hearing this, the secretary&#x27;s face immediately fell.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, time is too tight. There will be problems. I don&#x27;t care. Old immortal demos eyes were filled with madness. The great Sa Kingdom can build a space plane in a month, but we still can&#x27;t carry out man space flight after so long.</p>
<p>If you can&#x27;t do it, you&#x27;re all fired. The secretary dared not persuade him further and could only nod in agreement. My heart is filled with despair. This isn&#x27;t about rushing to meet deadlines. It&#x27;s gambling with the astronauts lives.</p>
<p>But there was no other way. Demo. The immortal has gone mad. The next day, 7:00 in the morning, the sight of the maiden flight of the Kuening space plane. The global live stream started on time.</p>
<p>The live stream was instantly flooded with 1 billion viewers. It&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s here. We&#x27;ve finally waited for the maiden flight. I&#x27;ve been logged into this live stream since 3:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Who was here earlier than me? I wonder if we&#x27;ll be able to see what the moon&#x27;s surface really looks like this time. Everyone was filled with anticipation. 7:50. The silver kuing space plane slowly drove out of the hangar under the rising sun. The fuselage is 95 m long and the wingspan is 75 m.</p>
<p>Kuan awakening. It is full of science fiction elements. The live stream chat instantly went wild. Wow, this is so cool. It&#x27;s even more outrageous than a science fiction movie.</p>
<p>This size looks like it could fit a whole building. Look at the alloy coating on the fuselov. It gleams with a blue light in the sunlight. It&#x27;s amazing. Dormatory of Siaki Yuan.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong sat in front of the computer, his eyes wide open. I forgot to bite the bun in my hand. I&#x27;ll blanch it. This is the Kimping space plane. It&#x27;s even more impressive than I imagined.</p>
<p>He stared at the space plane on the screen, his fists clenching unconsciously. One day, I will also set foot on the moon. I&#x27;m going to catch up with old Lynn. During this time, he learned more about Lin Shin&#x27;s glorious deeds. He idolized Lynn Shun to the point of complete devotion.</p>
<p>As for why they didn&#x27;t go to Lyn Shan, he also wanted to achieve something through his own efforts before looking for Lyn Shan. Let&#x27;s return our attention to the maiden flight. 8:00 sharp. Lie Jian Guo stepped onto the live broadcast stage. He was wearing a dark Xan suit and his hair was neatly combed.</p>
<p>Good morning everyone. Today is the most important day in the history of the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s space program. Our astronauts will embark on a manned lunar mission aboard the Kuing spacecraft. 30 years ago, our astronauts entered space for the first time. Today, we want to say to the whole world, &quot;The great Sea Kingdom will set foot on the moon.&quot; The words had barely left his mouth.</p>
<p>Thunderous applause erupted around the tarmac. The live stream chat exploded. Deanley is right. That&#x27;s so inspiring. I feel tears welling up in my eyes.</p>
<p>Our country has finally become strong. I could repeat this phrase a hundred times. The great Sia Kingdom will set foot on the moon. Lie Jian Guo raised his hand to suppress the applause and continued. There are six astronauts on this maiden flight.</p>
<p>They will stay on the moon for 2 hours to complete soil sampling and environmental surveys. Live broadcast throughout. Let the whole world witness the power of the great SIA kingdom. Now, let&#x27;s welcome the six astronauts. The access road on one side of the apron is open.</p>
<p>Six astronauts wore newly developed speciallydesigned white space suits with bright red national flags printed on their chests. They marched out in neat steps. Old Jang, who was in the lead, had red eyes. He gave a standard military salute to the camera. Rest assured, motherland.</p>
<p>Rest assured, people, we will definitely complete the mission. Other astronauts also expressed their opinions. Every word is brimming with passion. Viewers in the live stream were moved to tears. Old Jang is almost 50 and he&#x27;s still working so hard.</p>
<p>Respect. Shiaol Wong is so young. He&#x27;s only 28 and he&#x27;s already on the moon. That&#x27;s amazing. Seeing the national flag on their chests, I instantly felt proud.</p>
<p>Keep going. We&#x27;re waiting for you to come back safe and sound. 8:15. Astronauts boarded the Kuen Pung in turn. Old Jang and the others began operating according to the emergency training given last night.</p>
<p>Soon the Kuaning space plane system was officially launched. Then start the self test. A moment later, selfch check complete. Old Jang instantly became excited. Report: Kuing selfch check complete.</p>
<p>Requesting takeoff. Lie Jian Guo issued the order. Kuong, prepare for takeoff. Have a safe journey. Receive.</p>
<p>Old Jang responded excitedly and then pressed the takeoff button. The next second, three specially designed anti-gravity plasma engines began to roar. The aircraft slowly ascended into the air. 5 m, 10 m, 50 m, 2,000 m. At this moment, Kuong suddenly raised its head and began to accelerate.</p>
<p>Mach 1, Mach 5, Mach 10, Mach 20. It can accelerate to Mach 20 in a short time. It broke through the clouds in an instant and was in the live broadcast view for hours. The live stream chat went completely crazy. Holy crap, it&#x27;s anti-gravity takeoff again.</p>
<p>My god, that&#x27;s incredibly fast. It feels even faster than the white emperor space fighter. Congratulations on the successful maiden flight of the Kuening. Wishing the astronauts a safe return, I can&#x27;t wait to see the astronauts set foot on the moon command center. Lie Jian Guo approached Lin Chun filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, you succeeded again, this time. Yes, Lynchin nodded. It will definitely succeed. Lie Jian Guo nodded with a smile. Yes, well soon be witnessing history.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Kuping space plane has broken through the atmosphere. Arriving in near Earth space, it begins to orbit the Earth near its surface. Shia Wong lay outside, gazing at the beautiful space and the lovely blue planet. His eyes filled with excitement. Is this Earth? It&#x27;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>Old Jang chuckled from the side. Heihei, isn&#x27;t it beautiful? It looked just like this when I first saw the blue planet from space. Shiao Wong was still excited. Now I&#x27;m even more curious about what the moon will be like. Will there really be a Chonga? Old Jang smiled and said, &quot;There&#x27;s definitely no Chonga, but we can build the moon palace in the future.&quot; After saying that, his expression turned serious.</p>
<p>We need to start accelerating. They are still flying around at Mach 20. Even at Mach 20, it&#x27;s only 6.8 km/s. It has not yet reached the first cosmic velocity of 7.9 km/s. To escape the gravitational pole of Earth, one would need to reach the second cosmic velocity of 11.2 km/s.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate to Mach 40 or higher. As the Kuing space plane continues to accelerate, soon the speed reached a terrifying speed of over Mach 40. After finding the correct orientation of the moon, old Jeang and his team directly adjusted the flight direction of the Kuing space plane. The speed instantly soared to a maximum of Mach 60. It flew towards the moon.</p>
<p>Chapter 117. Arriving on the moon in 6 hours. Ground command center. Watching the Kuaning space plane accelerate to Mach 60 in an instant. The entire command center fell into dead silence.</p>
<p>The next second, a deafening cheer erupted. Mach 60. It really has reached Mox 60. Great. We actually did it.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn, we succeeded. Chief Engineer Lynn is awesome. Great Sia Kingdom is awesome. Some people slammed their fists on the table while others hugged each other and cried. Even the usually composed Li Jang Guo was so moved that he burst into tears.</p>
<p>He looked at Lynch beside him, his voice choked with emotion. Lynn, we&#x27;re getting closer and closer to the moon. Lynch nodded, his gaze fixed on the Kuan Pong on the screen. It&#x27;s not over yet. The real test is yet to come to accelerate to Mach 60.</p>
<p>However, there will still be considerable challenges in successfully landing on the moon. Before reaching lunar orbit, the speed must be reduced to a level where lunar gravity can capture it. Otherwise, it would fly directly over the moon and into deep space. This also requires precise control of the deceleration process. However, Lynchin still has great confidence in Kimping.</p>
<p>Landing on the moon is inevitable. On the other side, in the live stream, the audience erupted in cheers. Holy crap, Mach 60. This is going to fly into space. The distance from Earth to the moon is about 380,000 km, so it would only take 6 hours to get there.</p>
<p>The US took 3 days to land on the moon. We&#x27;ve compressed it to 6 hours. This isn&#x27;t a space plane. It&#x27;s an interstellar warship. The great Sea Kingdom is awesome.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m proud. I&#x27;m honored. Someone actually did the math. The comment section was flooded with messages like 380,000 km divided by Mach 60 almost equals 6 hours. It really only takes 6 hours.</p>
<p>This comment just appeared. They were instantly pushed to the front row. Immediately afterwards, the screen was filled with the words 6 hours. Audiences around the world were stunned into silence by this speed. NASA headquarters in the United States.</p>
<p>In the conference room, Durit stared at the speed data on the screen, his face filled with disbelief. Mach 60, how is that possible? Our starships only have a top speed of Mach 20. The expert standing nearby pulled up a flight trajectory diagram of the Coen Pung, his voice trembling. Director looked its flight trajectory perfectly matches the optimal orbit. Not a single deviation.</p>
<p>This navigation system is at least 10 years more advanced than ours. Another expert, his eyes filled with shock. And there&#x27;s an anti-gravity engine. They actually broke through this technology that the whole world couldn&#x27;t solve. We&#x27;re falling further and further behind.</p>
<p>Dur&#x27;s heart was filled with complex emotions. 6 months ago. In terms of space technology, the Great Sea Kingdom is at the same level as the United States. Perhaps there are still some areas where we lag behind, but it only took 6 months. The Great Sea Kingdom was far ahead.</p>
<p>What exactly happened in the Great Sea Kingdom during this period? Could it be because the Great Sea Kingdom discovered some alien technology after exploring the far side of the moon? It seems that next time a starship lands on the moon, we must go to the far side of the moon to see what it&#x27;s all about. Durret secretly wondered what was going on. He looked up at the silent experts and patiently said, &quot;Everyone, the more this is the case, the harder we must work to catch up. We cannot remain behind the Great Sa Kingdom forever. As long as we work hard enough, we will one day catch up with the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. The technical experts didn&#x27;t react at all. This was the maiden flight of the Kuaning space plane. Destroyed their confidence to catch up with the Great Sea Kingdom. Is it really possible? Even if the Great Sa Kingdom stops developing with current technology, they estimate it will take decades to catch up and decades later.</p>
<p>Heaven knows what terrifying things the Great Sa Kingdom will become. Even many experts have considered immigrating to the Great Sa Kingdom. They also wanted to see just how many secrets the Great Sea Kingdom was still hiding. Trudeau was filled with helplessness as he saw the experts remain silent. He didn&#x27;t say anything more.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the flight path of the Kuaning space plane. At the same time, European Union Space Agency looking at the flight data of the Kuing space plane. The scientists fell silent. After a long silence, the person in charge, Marco, sighed. Sigh.</p>
<p>I was even thinking of cooperating with the great Sia Kingdom. Now it seems that it was all just wishful thinking on our part. The French scientist standing nearby gave a rice smile. Yes, who would have thought that the great sea kingdom would make such rapid breakthroughs in the field of space. A speed of Mach 60 that completely defies the laws of physics.</p>
<p>John Bull scientist said in a deep voice, &quot;I suggest that we have the higher-ups contact the great sea kingdom. If we can secure cooperation with the great SIA kingdom, then we can save a lot of time and money. Otherwise, we will lose resources in space and on the moon. All the scientists nodded in agreement. Once the great SIA kingdom successfully lands on the moon, a lunar base will definitely be built and lunar resources will be mined in the future.</p>
<p>At that time, they will be left with nothing but helpless stairs. India&#x27;s space agency demo the Immortal originally came to check on their man spaceflight progress. When we saw the coimping space plane reach Mach 60 and fly towards the moon. I feel terrible. He looked at the scientists and asked in a deep voice.</p>
<p>Can we achieve that speed? The surrounding scientists fell silent. Demo the immortal instantly understood and angrily cursed. Are you all useless? If the great Sa Kingdom can do it, why can&#x27;t you? I don&#x27;t care what methods you use. You must launch a man&#x27;s space flight within a week. Even if it costs astronauts their lives, we must fly out of Earth.</p>
<p>The scientists turned pale and no one dared to refute them. But his heart was filled with despair. This is not a moon landing. This is a death sentence. Desert region.</p>
<p>Several wealthy countries gathered together and sat in a luxurious palace. Watching the live stream, my eyes were filled with envy. King Satia set down his golden goblet, his tone urgent. Contact the great Sia Kingdom immediately. We are willing to invest 100 billion US.</p>
<p>I only asked to cooperate with them and participate in the lunar project. The Azerbaijani King nodded. I&#x27;ll vote too. We&#x27;re going to build a base on the moon. The technology of the great Sea Kingdom is terrifying.</p>
<p>Cooperating with them is the wise thing to do. They had previously hesitated about whether to cooperate with the United States. Seeing Kuings performance now, they instantly sided with the great Sia Kingdom. Money means nothing to them. Being able to catch the fast train of the space age is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Even if we can&#x27;t collaborate on projects, we also need to secure a naming rights opportunity. In that case, they could be considered to have successfully landed on the moon. The entire world of Earth was deeply shocked by the speed of the coimping space plane. Only the land of cherry blossoms is the most painful. Seeing that the great Sa Kingdom had made another breakthrough made them feel worse than if they had swallowed a dead fly.</p>
<p>Majiro once again flew into a rage. Utterly powerless, they are frantically urging Dr. Kawashima to speed up the mass production of the destructive bacteria. Chapter 118. Successful moon landing.</p>
<p>A moment that will go down in history. 5 and 1/2 hours later. In the vast expanse of space, the Kuaning space plane is getting closer and closer to the moon. Inside the cockpit, Lao Jang stared at the screen and took a deep breath. Prepare to slow down.</p>
<p>Embrace the moon&#x27;s gravity. Receive. All the astronauts were filled with excitement. They began issuing deceleration commands to the Kuing. The speed began to decrease.</p>
<p>Mach 50, Mach 30, Mach 10. As the speed continues to decrease, it was quickly captured by the moon&#x27;s gravity. Next, the Kimping space plane entered the outermost orbit of the moon. Begin orbiting the moon. Then, while orbiting the moon, constantly changing tracks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the moon&#x27;s outline became increasingly clear. The gray surface is covered with meteorite craters. Shiao Wong stared at the surface of the moon completely stunned. Is this the moon? Just as described in the astronomy textbook. From Earth&#x27;s perspective, the moon is absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>In fact, the moon is full of craters. Old Jang smiled inside. That&#x27;s normal because the moon has shielded Earth from countless meteorites and celestial bodies. That&#x27;s why the surface of the moon is like that. We also have to thank the moon for its selfless contribution.</p>
<p>After expressing his feelings, old Jang reminded him. Everyone please pay attention. Next, determine the landing site. According to the plan, our target landing site this time is Mayor Tranquilatus on the moon. That is the moon landing site that the US claimed to have been located back then.</p>
<p>Shiao Wong was stunned for a moment. Then his eyes lit up. The sea of tranquility on the moon. Isn&#x27;t that the place the US claimed to have landed on the moon? Old Jang nodded and said meaningfully, &quot;That&#x27;s right. This is the first landing coordinate set by headquarters.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s to let everyone see whether the US actually landed on the moon.&quot; Then Lao Jang and his team continued to maneuver the space plane around the moon. It was also to find coordinates for a suitable landing site in the Sea of Tranquility on the moon. Ground command center. All the engineers were excited. Haha, it has already started orbiting the moon.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so excited. We&#x27;ll be able to see the moon landing soon. All the engineers were filled with anticipation. They have been waiting for this day for decades. Since the last century, the space race between the United States and Russia has been ongoing.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom has always hoped that one day it could also successfully send people to the moon. Regardless of whether the US actually succeeded in landing on the moon back then, this has always been the goal of the aerospace engineers of the great Sia Kingdom. Today, this wish is finally about to come true. Their eyes were filled with admiration and gratitude as they looked at Lin Shan. Lie Jian Guo looked at Lin Chan with emotion, his voice slightly choked.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, we&#x27;re about to land on the moon. This will be the first time that a man spacecraft from our planet has directly landed on the moon. This moment will be recorded in history and you are the greatest contributor. No, Lynch and shook his head. This is the result of the joint efforts of countless scientific researchers.</p>
<p>Landing on the moon is just the beginning. The ultimate goal is to develop the moon. Lie Jian Guo instantly became excited. Okay, I believe you. On the other side, live broadcast room.</p>
<p>Those spectators who were waiting in ambush when we saw the Kuening space plane begin its lunar orbit. I got excited instantly. Holy crap, they&#x27;ve already started orbiting the moon. Well, it was worth waiting for over 5 hours. I finally waited for this moment.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should land at the very spot where the US landed on the moon and expose their lies on the spot. He some people have analyzed that it is fake, but the US just refuses to admit it. Hopefully, this time it will truly be the United States. All nizens in China are eagerly anticipating a slap in the face from the United States. At the same time, the eyes of the world are focused on the Kuening.</p>
<p>Everyone is waiting, waiting for the moment when the Kuan Pong lands. We await the moment when the truth is revealed. NASA, the US Space Agency. The atmosphere became very oppressive. an elderly expert, his face contorted with worry, whispered, &quot;Director, if the great Sia kingdom really lands on the sea of tranquility on the moon, then we Durits face was terribly grim, and in the end, he could only sigh helplessly.</p>
<p>Sigh. We can only pray that the great Sia kingdom won&#x27;t land on the sea of tranquility on the moon. Otherwise, we will become a laughingtock of the whole world.&quot; Back then, they did this to bring down the predecessor of the great Mao Kingdom. They fabricated a colossal lie about a man moon landing. Decades have passed.</p>
<p>They have been working hard to develop in the space field. They wanted to land on the moon again before the lie was exposed. As planned, they will definitely be able to send people to the moon within 5 years. However, the great sea kingdom suddenly rose to prominence. Catch the Americans off guard.</p>
<p>Now, we can only pray that the great sea kingdom didn&#x27;t land in the sea of tranquility on the moon. only durs prayers were doomed to fail because of the moon&#x27;s near-Earth orbit. The Kuwaning space plane has locked onto the coordinates of the Sea of Tranquility on the moon. Inside the cockpit, Jang has already begun applying for a landing. Reporting to headquarters, the login coordinates have been located.</p>
<p>Requesting landing. Clearance for landing. Receive. Olang suddenly became nervous. Concentrate everyone.</p>
<p>Prepare for landing. Receive. All the astronauts responded excitedly. Then the Kuing space plane is getting slower and slower. At the same time, the altitude continues to decrease.</p>
<p>8 km, 6 km, 1,000 m, 500 m, 100 m. Old Jang and the others stared quietly at the screen. Because at this moment, all operations are being performed by the intelligent agent Kuanping alone. Various operation instructions are constantly displayed on the screen. Attention.</p>
<p>Preparing for landing. Adjust the anti-gravity engine power to 20%. Expected landing in 10 seconds. Please sit tight. All the astronauts were excited.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Kuening space plane is only a dozen meters above the ground. The landing gear at the bottom has been deployed. The craters on the lunar surface are becoming increasingly clear. You can even see the fine textures on the ground. In the live stream room, over a billion viewers held their breath.</p>
<p>No one posted any comments. No one spoke. Everyone was glued to the screen, waiting for the historic moment. Finally, bang. A slight vibration.</p>
<p>The Kuwan&#x27;s landing gear landed steadily on the lunar surface. A line of green text popped up on the screen. Kuening has successfully landed on the moon. Old Jang and the others only felt a slight tremor in their bodies. Then I got really excited.</p>
<p>Calling headquarters. We have landed successfully. Ground command center. Landing successful. Moment.</p>
<p>All the engineers in the command center stood up and cheered. Applause and cheers resounded throughout the command center. Then the engineers led the way toward Lynchun. Lynch was completely bewildered. Several people picked him up and tossed him into the air.</p>
<p>Repeat this process. This is to express their excitement at the moment. Lynch smiled and shared their joy. Lie Jian Guo stood to the side watching, his eyes welling up with tears, muttering to himself, &quot;We did it. We&#x27;ve successfully landed on the moon.&quot; On the other side in the live stream room, the barrage of comments was dense and thicker than paste.</p>
<p>Success. The Great Sa Kingdom has successfully landed on the moon. I cried. It was so hard. It only took us 1 month to get from low Earth orbit to the moon.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom is awesome. Global media instantly push notifications of breaking news. The titles are all, &quot;The Great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s Kuing Space plane has successfully landed on the moon. Chapter 119. Unveiling the US&#x27;s century old lie.</p>
<p>The international online forums were in complete uproar. Japanese nizens baka. The Great Sea Kingdom actually landed on the moon. How are we going to get revenge? South Korean nizens. Damn it.</p>
<p>The great Sia Kingdom must have stolen our technology. Give it back to us right now. A netzen from Hjo commented, &quot;It&#x27;s over. The Great Sea Kingdom has successfully landed on the moon. Will they retaliate against us?&quot; A nizen nicknamed polar bear commented, &quot;Sigh.</p>
<p>The great sea kingdom is really about to take off.&quot; An American nizen asked, &quot;Was our man moon landing real or fake back then? The entire world of Earth is watching this.&quot; India&#x27;s space agency demo the immortal stared at the screen. His face ashen. Look at them. The great Sea Kingdom has already landed its space shuttle on the moon. We can&#x27;t even land a man on the moon.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re all useless. The surrounding scientists were filled with resentment but dared not speak out. Don&#x27;t they even consider what kind of research environment India has. Even starting a project normally can get stuck for years. After the project was approved, the application for funding was met with various demands for bribes and kickbacks.</p>
<p>They applied for 10 million yuan in funding, but the project team ended up with only 100,000 yuan left. In this situation, still want technological breakthroughs. Dream US space agency. The atmosphere was so oppressive it was almost palpable. Chief Durret stared at the screen, his eyes filled with rage.</p>
<p>Their landing point was Jing Hai. The engineer beside him said in a trembling voice, &quot;Director, Jing Hai is the area where we landed on the Apollo moon.&quot; The Luth grew anxious and ordered, &quot;Quick, find a way to disrupt their live stream immediately.&quot; The engineer said with a pained expression, &quot;We can&#x27;t interfere. Their signal encryption level is too high. We can&#x27;t crack it. We&#x27;re doomed.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re about to be exposed. Dur sat slumped in his chair, his face ashen. White House. The secretary reported nervously. President, the great Sa Kingdom has successfully landed on the moon and is preparing for lunar exploration.</p>
<p>OPT sat on the sofa, head down, deep in thought. Nobody knows what he&#x27;s thinking. After a moment, he slowly raised his head, frowned, and asked, &quot;When will our starship be able to make its second maiden flight?&quot; The secretary whispered in response. It&#x27;s expected to take another two weeks. Half a month.</p>
<p>Opt nodded. Tell them to speed things up. Give them whatever resources they need. They must succeed. He suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>His eyes turning sinister. Notify the CA. Find a way to obtain the anti-gravity technology data of the great Sia Kingdom. At all costs. Okay.</p>
<p>The surface of the moon. Quimping space plane. Old Jang calmly gave the following instructions. As planned, leave two people behind to guard the spaceship. The rest of you, come with me to the moon for exploration and sampling.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the two pilots who plan to stay behind were somewhat disappointed. Old Jang smiled and reassured them. Don&#x27;t worry, this is the maiden flight. There will definitely be more flight missions in the future, and we&#x27;ll all have the opportunity to land on the moon. Real? The two pilots who stayed behind were instantly overjoyed.</p>
<p>Jang nodded and offered no further explanation. Then he led Shiao Wong and two other astronauts to the isolation chamber. Wear a special space suit inside. After the inspection was completed and no problems were found, they boarded the two lunar rovers. The lunar rover is entirely silver white with a bright red national flag printed on its body.</p>
<p>Its large wheels are suitable for driving on the lunar surface. The lunar rover was also customdeveloped. It can travel on the moon and can also be responsible for collecting mineral samples. It can also be used to survey the lunar topography. Wherever the lunar rover has traveled, the area within a 10 km radius will be clearly recorded.</p>
<p>Moreover, the lunar rover is made of special materials. It can withstand extreme high and low temperatures. Otherwise, considering the temperature difference on the moon, which is 180° C during the day and minus 180° C at night, ordinary materials simply cannot withstand it. After making all the preparations, the hatch slowly opened, the robotic arm was released to grab the two lunar rovers and place them on the lunar surface. Bang! The moment the lunar rover was placed, it makes a slight sound.</p>
<p>Dust that had been dormant on the moon for countless years was stirred up. Old Jean drives car number one and Little Wong drives car number two. Set off. Objective: explore the tranquil sea area. The lunar rover slowly started moving.</p>
<p>The camera in the live stream followed the lunar rover as it moved. Clear tire tracks were left behind from what the US propaganda back then. Whether it&#x27;s the reflection of the lunar rover or the tire tracks. They are vastly different. At this point, the viewers in the live stream were completely captivated by the scenery of the moon.</p>
<p>Wow. So, this is the surface of the moon. Well, my beautiful dreams have been completely shattered. Why didn&#x27;t we find Chonga? And what about the moon palace? I want the moon rabbit. Where is my moon rabbit? Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Has everyone forgotten about the stars and stripes that the US planted back then? The viewers in the live stream gradually recovered from their initial shock and teasing. The conversation then shifted to another highly anticipated point. Did the US actually log in? Everyone was watching the live stream intently. I don&#x27;t want to miss any of the wonderful moments. As the lunar rover continued to slowly move across the lunar surface, apart from silence and desolation, no traces of human activity were found.</p>
<p>If a person were to live in such an environment over time, they might all develop mental illness. Fortunately, this was the first time the moon had been landed. Everyone was in a state of excitement. Xiao Wong stared out the car window puzzled and said, &quot;Brother Jeang, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s anything special on the moon.&quot; Old Jang laughed and said, &quot;Haha, if something really happens, we&#x27;ll be in danger. Just wait.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll be at the coordinates where the US planted its flag back then. Soon, they reached the landing coordinates of the American Apollo 11. The lunar rover came to a stop. Old Jang and Little Wong got off the bus. The moment I stepped onto the moon, they had a light and airy feel to them.</p>
<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the special space suit, I reckon they could float up with the slightest movement. After all, the moon&#x27;s gravity is only one sixth that of Earth. But with every step, lunar dust would be kicked up. Old Jang and Shia Wong carefully observed their surroundings. No traces of a moon landing were found.</p>
<p>The legendary stars and stripes flag was nowhere to be seen. Shia Wong also took out a detector and scanned the surroundings. The result was still nothing. Brother Jeang, it&#x27;s been confirmed that the US was lying all along. Upon hearing this, the live stream room completely exploded.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Was the US moon landing a hoax back then? Damn. It really was a Hollywood moon landing. The US is a big liar. My god, this is a scam of the century.</p>
<p>The worst off was the former Soviet Union. There were experts frantically trying to defend it before. Where are those experts? Come out and show yourselves. Old Jang picked up his camera and took pictures of the surrounding area as evidence. He faced the camera, his voice serious.</p>
<p>It turns out that the US did not send any people to the moon back then. After saying that, he took a speciallymade five-star red flag from the lunar rover and planted it on the lunar surface. Then addressing the live stream audience, he proudly stated, &quot;From this day forward, our great Sea Kingdom will be the first nation to send people to the moon. Chapter 120. the terrifying mineral resources of the moon.</p>
<p>Ground command center. Lynchin had just been put down. After hearing Lao Jang shout those exciting words, he was once again picked up and tossed into the air by several people who cheered and celebrated. The engineers around him were moved to tears. Huh.</p>
<p>The moon belongs to our great Sea Kingdom. From now on, the resources of the moon belong to our great Sia kingdom. Let&#x27;s see who can compete with us for the moon&#x27;s resources this time. The engineers have already claimed the moon as the property of the great Sia Kingdom. Don&#x27;t mention international conventions.</p>
<p>Whoever has the ability should go up. If you can&#x27;t get there, don&#x27;t even mention international conventions. Those are all ways to restrain the weak. Looking at the excited crowd, Li Jang Guoo felt a surge of pride welling up inside him. The command center was in an uproar.</p>
<p>The viewers in the live stream were no exception. They were even more excited. The barrage of comments instantly covered the entire screen, making it impossible to see the image clearly. Wow, I&#x27;m so excited. I wish I could fly to the moon right now and see it.</p>
<p>W I hope one day I can travel to the moon. I&#x27;m saving money now. I believe I&#x27;ll be able to embark on my lunar journey very soon. I hope that day comes soon. I can&#x27;t wait.</p>
<p>All netizens are eagerly anticipating the day when lunar travel begins. At the same time, throughout the great Sea Kingdom, celebrations were also taking place. In front of the giant screen in Beijing Square, the crowd erupted in deafening cheers. The elderly men and women waved small national flags and shouted along. Long live the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Long live the people. The students cheered on campus. We&#x27;ve landed on the moon. We&#x27;re the first. The Bund Shanghai.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the lights came on. The banner reads Dashia Aerospace. Chasing dreams of the stars. Passers by stopped to take pictures. In rural areas, some people even set off firecrackers, making it as lively as Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>In a remote mountain primary school, children gathered around their teacher&#x27;s phone to watch a live stream, their eyes shining. Teacher, will we be able to go to the moon someday? The teacher smiled and nodded. Yes, you will. As long as you study hard, you definitely can. Border guards in the southwest region watched the live broadcast with tears welling up in their eyes.</p>
<p>Haha. Our great Sea Kingdom has become powerful again. That&#x27;s right. Since the last incident, the Indians have retreated 100 km. We&#x27;re so bored without that little Indian.</p>
<p>He after the first class merit award, aren&#x27;t you? Haha. Har. At the same time, the situation is quite different internationally. in the forums of the US-led allies. The alliance&#x27;s netizens were extremely sour.</p>
<p>The comment section was as sour as if decades old pickled cabbage had been spilled. Damn it. Why was the great Sea Kingdom able to become the first country to land a man on the moon? Did the US actually land on the moon back then? Why isn&#x27;t our flag on the moon? I think it&#x27;s a video created using technology by the great Sea Kingdom. They definitely didn&#x27;t succeed in landing on the moon. Many American nizens are unwilling to accept this cruel reality.</p>
<p>Why was the great SEA kingdom able to successfully send people to the moon and they, the United States, are the world&#x27;s leading technological and military power? Was the man moon landing a hoax? It&#x27;s utterly humiliating. Many American citizens took to the streets to display banners. We hope the US government will provide an explanation. NASA, the US Space Agency, Durit remained silent. Their lies were completely exposed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s estimated that the US will soon become a laughingstock around the world again. Alas, a lie is still a lie. He sighed helplessly. This is the result of the sins committed by the previous generation. But this generation has to bear the burden.</p>
<p>Let them become a laughing stock of the whole world. All the people who devised the moon landing program are dead. At this moment, a scientist with a full head of white hair, Elson solemnly said. director. The aerospace technology of the great SEA kingdom is far more advanced than we imagined.</p>
<p>Their space planes can land directly on the moon and their lunar rovers adapt to the lunar environment so easily. This proves they already have the capability to mine lunar resources. In this way, the moon will become the backyard of the great sea kingdom. With the resources on the moon, the technological development of the Great Sa Kingdom is unimaginable. In the end, Elson dared not continue.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom is now far beyond the reach of the Americans. If only the moon had its vast resources. To what extent has the Great Sea Kingdom developed? I can&#x27;t even imagine it. The surrounding engineers kept their heads down, and no one dared to speak. Trudeau&#x27;s feelings were complicated.</p>
<p>He remained silent for a moment, then spoke. We cannot give up. We also have starships. As long as our starships can carry people to the moon, we can easily plan our flag anywhere and seize some resources. Upon hearing this, Elsen and the others remain silent.</p>
<p>Now, even their starship man space flight is difficult. Not to mention man lunar landings. Will the great SA kingdom stop and wait? Obviously impossible. However, Trudeau is also right. No matter how difficult it is, we cannot give up.</p>
<p>Inside the White House, Optton watched the live stream. His face terribly grim.  Damn the great Sea Kingdom. They didn&#x27;t even give us any face. He wasn&#x27;t angry because the Great Sea Kingdom had successfully landed on the moon.</p>
<p>In any case, the successful moon landing of the Great Sa Kingdom did not cause any loss to the United States. But the Great Sea Kingdom went specifically to pick up their short stories. This made him unhappy. Why don&#x27;t you just focus on your moon mission? Why would you go and pick up someone&#x27;s debts? Doesn&#x27;t that just make people hate you? President, the great SEA kingdom has successfully landed on the moon. Will they eventually conquer the entire moon? The secretary standing nearby cautiously offered a reminder.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Opton frowned and said in a deep voice, &quot;That is indeed possible. It seems that we still need to send people to the moon as soon as possible. At the same time, we must also unite with other countries to revise new space regulations.&quot; He knew that the space technology of the great Sea Kingdom was already unstoppable. However, we cannot allow the great sea kingdom to monopolize all the resources on the moon. The great sea kingdom must share this.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it would be disrupting the peace of earth. With that in mind, he summoned Secretary of State Raymond. He was instructed to contact other countries. I&#x27;m sure many countries would be willing to step forward in this kind of situation. On the moon, Old Jang and Shia Wong have already begun surveying the moon.</p>
<p>The lunar rover&#x27;s instruments flashed continuously, recording data on the surrounding terrain and mineral resources. Wow, so much iron ore and all of it is rich. Open pit mine, titanium or has been discovered and in very high concentrations and helium. Three, the reserves are staggering. As exploration continues, every now and then, Shiaolongs excited voice could be heard.</p>
<p>This demonstrates just how abundant the resources are on the entire moon. Anyone who owns a moon knows this. The moon has more than 1 million tons of helium minus three reserves. What does this mean? The total proven reserves of helium, three on the entire planet Earth, are only 15 tons. 100 tons of helium, three could meet the energy needs of the great sea kingdom for a year.</p>
<p>There are 1 million tons on the moon, enough for the Great Sea Kingdom to use for 10,000 years. In addition to helium 3, there is also a terrifying amount of titanium ore with reserves exceeding 100 trillion tons. Iron ore is even more terrifying. Even a 5cm layer of sand on the entire lunar surface contains large amounts of iron. In the lunar basalt zone, iron ore is directly exposed.</p>
<p>Total reserves 1,500 trillion tons. There are also various other minerals such as aluminum and copper. Rare earth minerals are even more numerous. Almost all the minerals discovered on earth to date. The moon will have it.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many minerals that Earth doesn&#x27;t have. If all of these were developed, the great Sa Kingdom has become the richest country in the world. Moreover, there is an even more mysterious far side of the moon waiting for the great Sia Kingdom to uncover. Chapter 121. Exploring the secrets of the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>Ground command center. The tears had not yet completely subsided. Lynchin walked up to Li Jian Guo and lowered his voice. Oldly, &quot;There&#x27;s something I need to discuss with you.&quot; Li Jian Guo had just calmed down when he turned to look at him. &quot;Son, what&#x27;s up?&quot; Lynchin whispered after Lao Jang and the others finished the survey and sampling.</p>
<p>&quot;Turn off the live stream. I want them to go and see the far side of the moon.&quot; &quot;The far side of the moon?&quot; Li Jian Guo suddenly raised his voice, then quickly lowered it again. His eyes were filled with shock. This This is too risky. Signal is down on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>What if something goes wrong? Mr. Lee, you don&#x27;t need to worry about the signal problem. Lynchin explained patiently. Kuan Pungs communication system has been upgraded and can connect normally with Earth. Moreover, we are already standing on the moon.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you want to see what secrets the far side of the moon holds? He always felt that the far side of the moon was not simple. He wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied without going and exploring. In fact, the Great Sea Kingdom also had the U24 probe conducting exploration work on the far side of the moon. However, the area is too small and no abnormalities have been found so far. That&#x27;s why Lynchin wanted Kuong 1 to take a look.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo was silent for a few seconds, then nodded. Good. Let&#x27;s do it your way. However, we must ensure that the technology is prepared for emergencies. Okay.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded. After Lao Jang and the others finish their task, we&#x27;ll turn off the live stream. Good. On the other side, the viewers in the live stream have gone completely crazy. Wow, the resources on the moon are so abundant.</p>
<p>If we can extract all the resources from the moon, we will never have to worry about developing our own resources again. Huh. I wonder if there will ever be a chance to mine minerals on the moon. I want to change my work environment. Hey, upstairs.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll come find you after I open a mine on the moon. He seeing such abundant resources on the moon, the people of the great sea kingdom eagerly await the day when lunar resources can be mined. Many large companies have even begun to contact the relevant functional departments of the Great Sa Kingdom. We are inquiring about the possibility of participating in the independent development and mining of resources on the moon. Faced with such vast mineral resources, no one could resist the temptation.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t just the great SA kingdom. Even nizens in hawk alliance countries are starting to get anxious.  The moon has such abundant resources. We can&#x27;t let the great Sia kingdom monopolize them. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>The moon belongs to all of earth and the great sea kingdom should share it. We must make the great sea kingdom share its lunar resources. Otherwise, we will all boycott the great sea kingdom. Eagle. The white house oval office.</p>
<p>Opton finally lost his composure. He stood up and paced back and forth in his office. No, we absolutely cannot let the great Sia kingdom monopolize so many lunar resources. The thought that the great Sia kingdom monopolized all the resources of the entire moon is unbearable. His heart was bleeding.</p>
<p>Most countries in the world know about the abundant resources on the moon. But because no one has been able to mine it, so everyone lived in peace. Just pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist. Things are different now. The great Sia Kingdom has the capability to mine lunar resources.</p>
<p>How could he not be anxious? Just like the saying goes online, everyone is suffering and suddenly someone is driving a Land Rover. That feeling of jealousy surged instantly. It seems we need to quickly discuss countermeasures with those countries. Otherwise, the moon will be in danger. OP and others had made up their minds.</p>
<p>They instructed Rayondo to expedite contacting the allied nations of the United States. They even contacted third world countries. Other countries shared the same idea and readily agreed after being contacted by the US. Even Russia began to feel jealous. Only wealthy desert nations have the self-awareness to reject the US.</p>
<p>All they want to do is spend money to invest and cling to the powerful backer of the great Sia Kingdom, the surface of the moon. Jang and Shia Wong have completed the sampling work as planned. Jang, should we turn back now? Jang nodded. Let&#x27;s return to Kuan Pong 1. Two lunar rovers drove toward the silver space plane.</p>
<p>The wheels left clear tracks on the gray dust. In the live stream room, the audience was still frantically spamming the live chat with comments. I haven&#x27;t seen enough. Take more pictures of the moon. When will lunar tourism begin? I&#x27;ll be the first to sign up.</p>
<p>The Americans must be green with envy right now. Haha. The moment the lunar rover drove into the Kuing hatch, the live stream suddenly went black. A line of text popped up. This lunar exploration mission has temporarily concluded.</p>
<p>Further updates will be provided later. Netizens in the great SA kingdom were instantly stunned. Why did you turn it off? I haven&#x27;t seen enough. Are we preparing to return home? We look forward to our heroes coming home. There will definitely be a follow-up.</p>
<p>The great SA kingdom never abandons things halfway. Although they were still enjoying themselves, no one complained. The comment section was filled with well-wishes for the astronauts. NASA, the US Space Agency. Durret stared at the black screen, his face grim.</p>
<p>Why was the live stream suddenly shut down? He looked at Elsen next to him. Elson pushed up his glasses, his brow furrowed. There are two possibilities. Either they&#x27;re turning back or they&#x27;re hiding something. Concealed.</p>
<p>Dur frowned. They&#x27;ve already obtained lunar resource data. What else are they hiding? The far side of the moon. Another scientist suddenly spoke up. I guess they might be going to explore the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>The meeting room fell silent the moment those words were spoken. Durret suddenly stood up. Impossible. There&#x27;s no signal on the far side of the moon. How could they communicate? Unless they have more advanced communication technology.</p>
<p>Elsen&#x27;s voice was serious and shocked. If they can actually explore the far side of the moon, then the gap between us and the great sea kingdom is more than 10 years. Dur&#x27;s face was terribly grim. Every time they thought they understood the great sea kingdom, even more advanced black technologies will emerge in the great sea kingdom. From quantum chips and super laser cannons to the space planes of today.</p>
<p>How many secrets does the great Sia Kingdom hold that we don&#x27;t know about? Trudeau is going crazy. All right, let&#x27;s not worry about the Great Sa Kingdom for now. Quickly analyze the data we obtained today and see which parts are relevant to our understanding. Strive to send a manned lunar mission as soon as possible. Elsen and the others nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>All they can do now is try their best to catch up with the Great Sea Kingdom. European Union Space Agency. Marco looked at the now blacked out live stream and sighed heavily. It&#x27;s still too late. We are still discussing whether to cooperate with the great SEA Kingdom, but they are already going much further.</p>
<p>The French scientist shook his head. I think they&#x27;ll most likely go to the far side of the moon. The New York scientist frowned. If they succeed, we&#x27;ll never have a chance to get a share of the resources on the moon again. Should we contact the Great Sea Kingdom? Someone made a suggestion.</p>
<p>Marco was silent for a few seconds, then shook his head. It&#x27;s no use contacting them now. Let&#x27;s wait for them to release further information. The meeting room was filled with a sense of powerlessness. They knew that no one could stop the advance of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Inside the Kimping space plane, Old Jang and the others are preparing to return. Suddenly, they received new instructions from Lie Jian Guo on the ground. Shiao Jang, I have an urgent task for you. The live stream was not shut down because of the return flight. Next, you will pilot the coimping to explore the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>Old Jang and Little Wong froze instantly. Xiao Wongs voice trembled with excitement. Dean Lee, are you serious? We&#x27;re going to the far side of the moon. It&#x27;s true. The technical team is ready for any contingencies, so you can go without worry.</p>
<p>Old Jang took a deep breath and clenched his fist. Mission accomplished. I wish you all the best. The call ended. Old Jang immediately made arrangements.</p>
<p>Kuong begins selfch check preparing for takeoff to the far side of the moon. On the screen, the data jumped around rapidly. Anti-gravity engine is functioning normally. Backup communication system is functioning normally. Board adjusted.</p>
<p>Target the far side of the moon. The Kimping space plane slowly ascended into the sky. It flew towards the other side of the moon. Chapter 122. The mysterious Aken Basin.</p>
<p>Not long after, Kuong. One flew to the far side of the moon. From the 3D visual radar screen, you can clearly see the craters of all sizes on the far side of the moon. Shia Wong was directly shocked by the numerous meteorite craters scattered everywhere. Wow.</p>
<p>This is the legendary far side of the moon. This shows how many cosmic meteorites the moon has shielded from Earth. According to estimates by astronomers, without the moon helping to block out a large number of celestial bodies of all sizes in the universe, every year, Earth faces numerous attacks from celestial bodies. Then it won&#x27;t be just an occasional meteor shower. Instead, it turned into frequent and intense celestial bombardment.</p>
<p>Life on Earth may have already been doomed. We should thank the moon, Old Jang exclaimed with emotion. Yes, it was the moon that sacrificed itself to protect our blue planet. The other astronauts were all deeply moved. Next, let&#x27;s explore the secrets of the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>Old Jang was full of anticipation. Then he ordered Kuan Ping one to continue flying. Ground command center. Looking at the live feed, Lie Jian Guo couldn&#x27;t help but sigh. Just as the astronomers predicted, the moon&#x27;s contribution to our blue planet is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Previously, it was all just speculation. Even if there are photos, they are rather blurry. This was also the first time Li Jang Wo had seen such clear photos of the far side of the moon. Those impact craters, large and small, all prove that the moon was scarred and battered in order to protect our planet. Lynchin couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim, &quot;This is a wonder of the universe.</p>
<p>In fact, the inherited memories he received contained a lot of information about the universe. Something like the moon almost doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot; This is evident. The location of blue star is so uniquely advantageous. It is protected not only by the Kyper belt at the outer edge of the solar system and the moon intercepts various celestial bodies every moment. It can be said to be the darling of the universe.</p>
<p>In particular, there are more than 200 countries of varying sizes on Earth and countless ethnic groups live together in mixed communities. It&#x27;s a miracle in the universe. Like other civilizations, often a single planet, a single species, and a single regime exist. Other creatures were either enslaved or used as food. Of course, it is precisely because of this situation.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why Earth&#x27;s technology has developed so rapidly. It has only taken a few thousand years for agricultural civilization to develop into today&#x27;s technological civilization. Many civilizations, even those that have developed for tens of thousands of years, may not have reached this level. Shaolin, do you think there really are traces left by extraterrestrial civilizations on the far side of the moon? Li Jiango couldn&#x27;t help but ask. Scientists have speculated about this before.</p>
<p>There may be traces of extraterrestrial civilizations on the far side of the moon. However, this has never been confirmed. Lynchan smiled and said, &quot;Who knows?&quot; But the answer will be revealed soon. Lie Jang Wu nodded and said nothing more. At this time on the big screen, Kuan Pung one continues to penetrate deeper into the far side of the moon, but nothing was found besides the numerous meteorite craters.</p>
<p>Nothing strange happened. If anyone wants to collect meteorites from outer space, go to the far side of the moon and you can have as much as you want. Inside the coimp cockpit, Shiaol Wongs excitement wore off, and he said somewhat boredly, &quot;Captain Jang, it seems there aren&#x27;t any secrets on the far side of the moon after all.&quot; Old Jang chuckled. Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if there wasn&#x27;t? Do you want to encounter aliens? He I wish I could really encounter aliens. We can catch it and keep it as a pet.</p>
<p>Force them to tell us about their alien technology. If they don&#x27;t tell us, well make them listen a hundred times. Shiaolong chuckled. The other astronauts were speechless, looking utterly bewildered. Ground command center.</p>
<p>Lynch looked at the desolate far side of the moon, somewhat disappointed. Could it be that I was really overthinking it? Lie Jian Guo patted him on the shoulder. Shaolin, isn&#x27;t it actually the best outcome if we don&#x27;t discover any extraterrestrial civilizations? That&#x27;s true. Lynch nodded. If we really do encounter traces of extraterrestrial civilization, that would prove that the coordinates of Earth may have already been discovered.</p>
<p>Instead, he began to worry about the safety of Earth. The dark forest law of the universe learned from inherited memories. Planets like Earth, which harbor life, are most favored by advanced civilizations in the universe. Once discovered, almost all of them could not escape the fate of being invaded and enslaved. If they find space pirates, they will be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Humans may become interstellar slaves, sold to other civilizations in the universe. Even Earth itself will be packaged and sold together. This shows how cruel the dark forest of the universe can be. It&#x27;s countless times more brutal than the competition we face on Earth today. However, Lynchin was still somewhat unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>Oldly have them survey the South Pole Akin Basin on the moon. Perhaps we&#x27;ll find something there. Sure, Lie Jian Guo did not refuse. The Aken Basin is actually the largest and deepest impact crater on the moon. It is even the largest and deepest basin discovered in the solar system to date.</p>
<p>Its total area reaches 4.9 million km, which is a quarter the size of the moon&#x27;s surface. It reaches a depth of 13 km deeper than the Mariana Trench, the deepest point on Earth. If there really is an extraterrestrial civilization on the moon, that can only be hidden deep within the Aken basin. soon. The command was then transmitted to Kuaning 1.</p>
<p>Everyone concentrate. Next, we&#x27;re going to explore the lunar south pole Akin Basin. After receiving the order, Lao Jang became serious. As an astronaut, he also had a basic understanding of the moon. They also knew about the unique characteristics of the Aken Basin.</p>
<p>Receive Xiao Wong and his friends put away their playful thoughts and became focused and serious. Kuong one adjusts its flight direction. They flew towards the Aken basin. Along the way, it remained deathly silent. There was no sign of any life.</p>
<p>However, some scientists have speculated that unknown life forms exist on the moon because there is water on the moon. It&#x27;s still a water resource worth hundreds of billions of tons. Where there is water, life will surely arise. However, the temperature difference between day and night on the moon is so great. There is also various forms of cosmic radiation.</p>
<p>If life truly exists, that would be an immense treasure for Earth. The research value is simply immeasurable. Scientists have long dreamed of discovering signs of life on planets beyond Earth. This could open up entirely new research areas for biology. It represents a major leap forward in humanity&#x27;s understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>All of this, they can only be explored when the great Sea Kingdom develops the moon later. This was just the maiden flight of the Coening space plane. It was just a simple survey of the moon. It&#x27;s not time to delve deeper yet. Not long after, Kuong one arrived at the Aken Basin.</p>
<p>Looking at the basin that stretches as far as the I can see. Old Jang and the others were deeply shocked. This is huge. It&#x27;s simply a miracle. If that meteorite had hit Earth back then, Earth would probably have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Even Lin Shan and Lie Jian Guo on the ground were slightly shocked. After the initial shock, Lin Shan was most concerned about whether there were any traces of extraterrestrial civilization in the Aken Basin. Continue. Fly to the very center of the basin and see if there are any other discoveries. Chapter 123.</p>
<p>A false alarm. Starstone. After receiving the instructions, Lao Jang. Then adjust the attitude of Kuan Ping 1. Fly towards the center of the basin.</p>
<p>Captain Jeang. Doesn&#x27;t this basin look like a cosmic monster with its mouth wide open? Could there really be aliens? Shiaolongs voice trembled slightly as he spoke. You know what? The entire Aken Basin as seen from high above. It really looks like a colossal cosmic beast with its mouth wide open. Don&#x27;t overthink it.</p>
<p>Everything must be based on facts. Old Jang neither denied it nor dared to be certain. The mysteries of the universe are beyond anyone&#x27;s explanation. Blue star can exist. With the universe being so vast, who can guarantee that there are no extraterrestrials? However, these are not things they need to consider right now.</p>
<p>Their primary task at present is to complete the exploration work in the Aken Basin. Shiao Wong didn&#x27;t say anything more, but he kept thinking about the aliens. As time passed, little by little, Kuing One has also arrived at the center of the Aken Basin. Above the center, the Kuan 1&#x27;s 3D visual radar began a full-range scan. Sudden, the alarm shattered the silence in the cockpit.</p>
<p>The screen displays the outlines of some huge metal objects. Captain Jang, could this be the wreckage of an alien spaceship? Shiao Wong pointed excitedly at the screen, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. Old Jang stared intently at the screen, his eyes filled with shock, and quickly reported. Reporting to headquarters. An unknown metallic object has been discovered, and it&#x27;s very large.</p>
<p>Ground command center. Lynshin frowned slightly. Could it be that I guessed right? Lie Jian Guo, on the contrary, became a little nervous. Shaolin, could this be the wreckage of an alien spaceship? Lynchan shook his head. It&#x27;s too early to tell.</p>
<p>Let them lower the altitude and take a look. He was also worried that it was just a meteorite or something similar. Li Jang Wu nodded and then turned to give the order directly. Shiao Jang, lower the altitude. Receive.</p>
<p>After receiving the instructions, Lao Jang immediately began to operate the machine. Kuan Pong 1 began its descent. 13 km, 10 km, 5 km, 1 km. At this moment, Kuan Pong one is only 1,000 m away from the deepest point. Meanwhile, the mysterious enormous metal object was now clearly visible.</p>
<p>It turned out to be just a large meteorite. It can now be confirmed that it is not some kind of alien spaceship. The scanning of Kuan Pung, one has been initiated. The scan results came back quickly. Unknown meteorite structure material unrecorded element energy reaction none.</p>
<p>Vital signs none signal feedback none. Upon seeing the results, Lao Jang immediately transmitted the data back to the ground command center. Command center. The scan results are in ground command center. After seeing the data sent by Lao Jang, all the engineers were a bit confused.</p>
<p>What is this thing? It&#x27;s not reacting at all. How could something like this exist on the moon? Could it be brand new alien or? Discussions rose and fell. Lie Jian Guo frowned slightly, looking at Lin Shun. Shaolin, what is this? Lyn Shun was also stunned. Overjoyed.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this the star that is extremely rare in the universe, passed down through generations of memories? It is specifically designed for making energy cubes. Even among advanced civilizations in the universe, it is a rare find. For some reason, there is such a large piece on the moon. This is like a windfall. Thank goodness no extraterrestrial civilization has ever visited.</p>
<p>Lynshan felt a surge of relief. However, it is not possible to be completely certain at this time. Samples need to be collected and tested to find out. Unfortunately, the equipment on Kuenping one was not capable of collecting data. A dedicated data collection tool needs to be developed later.</p>
<p>Currently, Earth&#x27;s technology is simply not advanced enough to cut the star stone. Fortunately, he has a space for inheritance which contains the corresponding collection techniques. However, this matter cannot be publicized widely yet. The fewer people who know, the better. He could only offer a tactful explanation.</p>
<p>Professor Lee, I can&#x27;t be sure right now. It might just be a special extraterrestrial meteorite. Well explore the moon properly after we&#x27;ve developed its resources. Let Kuan Pun returned first. Upon hearing this, Li Jang Wos heart sank.</p>
<p>As the dean of the Sea Academy of Sciences, he could easily understand the hidden meaning in Linch Chin&#x27;s words. That was clearly implying that the seriousness of the matter far exceeded what appeared to be the case. However, for some reason, it cannot be stated explicitly. After thinking it through, Li Jang Guo did not press the matter further. All right, let Kuan Pun one return to base first.</p>
<p>Kuing 1, please respond. Received, came Olden voice. cease the probe immediately and return to base. Receive. Return to base.</p>
<p>Shia Wong was stunned. But we haven&#x27;t figured out what&#x27;s going on with this thing yet. Old Jang interrupted him, saying sternly, &quot;Obey orders.&quot; He looked at the metal debris on the screen. Some secrets are not to be touched now. Kuan Pong one immediately ascended, then adjusted its course and slowly sailed away from the Aken basin.</p>
<p>Shiao Wong looked back at the metal fragments, his eyes filled with resentment. Captain Jang, will we come back? Old Jang nodded. Yes, I will. I&#x27;ll definitely come back when I&#x27;m ready. Ground command center.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos expression instantly turned serious. Attention everyone. The footage from just now is strictly prohibited from being disseminated. Sign a top secret confidentiality agreement now. The staff immediately distributed the agreements.</p>
<p>None of the engineers dared to slack off and quickly signed their names. Lynch stood to the side, his brows never relaxing. After Lie Jian Guo saw that everyone had signed the confidentiality agreement, he then instructed them to keep an eye on Ku Pong Wus return journey. Then she walked over to Lyn Shun and whispered, &quot;Lynshan, let&#x27;s go back first.&quot; Lynchan nodded. Then the two quickly left the command center.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re left looking at each other in bewilderment. This was the first time they had ever seen Lynchin so serious. It&#x27;s obvious that something important was just discovered, but no one discussed it anymore. They believed that when the time was right, they would definitely let them know. All the engineers snapped out of their revery.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on Kuan Pungs return journey. Li Jang Wos office. After the two sat down, Lie Jian Guo couldn&#x27;t wait to ask, &quot;Have you discovered something?&quot; Lynchin nodded, his expression serious. &quot;That&#x27;s right. That unknown metal we just saw is actually a very rare and special mineral in the universe.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo was stunned and asked in surprise, &quot;Special or what&#x27;s its use?&quot; Lynchin shook his head. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to say for now. Well have to wait until we confirm it.&quot; He wasn&#x27;t sure either. &quot;All right, then.&quot; Lie Jian Guo breathed a sigh of relief, but Lynch&#x27;s expression remained serious. Oldly, even though it&#x27;s uncertain, we must occupy the moon as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Controlled nuclear fusion and lunar bases need to be accelerated. Mine that unknown or as quickly as possible. If I&#x27;m right, it will be crucial for the future development of our great Sia kingdom. Lie Jian Guo nodded emphatically. Okay, I&#x27;ll go report to my superiors right now.</p>
<p>After saying that, he got up and left. Lynn Shun, filled with excitement, headed to the controlled nuclear fusion laboratory. The discovery of obsidian on the moon shattered all his original plans. All progress must be accelerated. That was something that made the great Sia Kingdom rich overnight.</p>
<p>We must take it. Chapter 124. Mobilizing the nation strength. A grand plan for people&#x27;s livelihood. After Li Jian Guo got on the bus, he immediately dialed the highest level hotline.</p>
<p>Hello, this is Lie Jian Guo from the Sia Academy of Sciences. There&#x27;s an emergency. I need to report this. Please make an appointment. Go now.</p>
<p>Great. I&#x27;ll be there soon. After hanging up the phone, Lie Jang Guoo urged the driver to speed up. Not long after, an office in Beijing. Inside sat a dignified old man.</p>
<p>Seeing Lie Jang Wos hurried appearance, the old man asked kindly, &quot;Dean Lee, what emergency has occurred that has you in such a hurry.&quot; &quot;Lie Jian Guo&quot; took a deep breath and explained rapidly. &quot;Kuan Pung, one has discovered an unknown metallic structure in the Aken Basin. Based on Lynch&#x27;s assessment, this could play a crucial role in the future development of our great Sia Kingdom. Upon hearing this, the old man asked with a hint of surprise, &quot;Did comrade Lynn specify what it is?&quot; Lie Jian Guo shook his head, &quot;No, but he also expressed his hope to accelerate the construction of controlled nuclear fusion and a lunar base. We can only finalize the decision once it&#x27;s developed.&quot; Kobayashi only hopes to occupy the entire moon as soon as possible and prevent other countries from getting their hands on it.</p>
<p>The old man nodded slightly, his tone solemn. It concerns the future development of the country. Pass the word. Mobilize the entire nation to support this. All resources, manpower, and authority should be allocated to this area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a special task force will be formed immediately with you in charge of coordinating the efforts. I will convene a meeting with the relevant departments and we will have them fully cooperate in implementing the plans proposed by comrade Xiaawan. Upon hearing this, Li Jang Guoo immediately perked up, stood up straight and solemnly replied, &quot;Yes, I guarantee to complete the mission.&quot; At the same time, he was also deeply shocked to receive such profound recognition from this person. This shows Lin Chin&#x27;s importance in the old man&#x27;s heart. Before Lie Jian Guo left, the old man told him to bring Lynch with him next time he came to report.</p>
<p>Not long after, the management of various ministries and commissions of the great Sia Kingdom received a secret order to fully cooperate with all the plans of the Sia Academy of Sciences. At the same time, Syaki controlled nuclear fusion laboratory. The engineers stood around a component looking worried. Chief engineer Lynn, the energy leakage rate of the superconducting magnetic confinement device still can&#x27;t be reduced. Where exactly did things go wrong? Could it be that we made a mistake in one of the steps? Lynch stepped forward and looked at the relevant data.</p>
<p>He quickly identified the problem and began to explain. Adjust the frequency of the confinement magnetic field to 1.2 GHz. And here we need. After listening to Lin Chin&#x27;s explanation, the engineers felt as if they had been enlightened. I instantly understood where the problem lay.</p>
<p>They immediately began redesigning the test parameters and modified it according to the ideas provided by Lynn Shun. Half an hour later, restart the test. Not long after, the test results came out. The original 5% energy leakage has now become 0%. The moment the result was announced, the entire laboratory erupted in excitement.</p>
<p>Professor Wong, the senior engineer, approached Lin Shan and said excitedly. Chief Engineer Lynn, we succeeded. This data is more perfect than I could have imagined. The other engineers looked at Lin Shan with excitement and admiration in their eyes. Chief Engineer Lynn, you are truly amazing.</p>
<p>The problem that has been bothering us for so many days was easily solved by you with just a little effort. Lynshan smiled and said modestly, &quot;I just happen to know the crux of the problem and happened to come up with a solution. It&#x27;s not as miraculous as you all make it out to be.&quot; Upon hearing this, Professor Wong&#x27;s lips twitched slightly. Listen to this. Is this even human language? Everything is just right.</p>
<p>What a coincidence. Comparisons are odious. While they were still internally criticizing Lynch Chun, seeing Lin Chin&#x27;s expression suddenly turned serious, he said earnestly, &quot;Everyone, there&#x27;s an emergency. The controlled nuclear fusion project must be accelerated. I hope to complete the ignition plan which was originally scheduled for 3 months within one month.</p>
<p>The engineers were instantly dumbfounded. A month? This is almost an impossible task. They were filled with doubt. Is war about to break out or perhaps kuing one encountered some mysterious event on the moon. However, no one asked the question.</p>
<p>Seeing Lynch&#x27;s serious expression, they already knew the gravity of the situation. Professor Wong was the first to respond. I have no problem. I will definitely do my best. We&#x27;re fine with it, too.</p>
<p>Everyone responded in unison. Okay. Lynch nodded. I will stay in the lab and solve problems as soon as possible. Objective: successfully ignite controlled nuclear fusion in 1 month.</p>
<p>All the engineers got busy. Lynch had just finished making the arrangements. Lie Jian Guo rushed into the laboratory with a face full of excitement. Shaolin, it&#x27;s approved. Lin Chens eyes lit up.</p>
<p>How so? We must mobilize the entire nation. Lie Jian Guo exclaimed, his voice trembling with excitement. All departments must cooperate fully to strive for the rapid occupation of the entire moon. Allocate dedicated funds for the initial construction of the lunar base. In addition, a special task force has been established with me as the team leader and you as the chief technical officer.</p>
<p>Lynshin felt relieved. Great. I will ensure the project is completed as quickly and efficiently as possible. It has the full support of the state. A small controlled nuclear fusion project is not something that can be done easily.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the controlled nuclear fusion project, the next step will be to begin building a lunar base and developing lunar resources. At the same time, talent development programs should be accelerated to solve the talent shortage problem. It requires a sufficiently large population base. However, the fertility rate in the great sea kingdom is declining. This is not a good thing for the future space development of the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>The issue of population birth rate must be addressed. Thinking of this, he said to Lie Jian Guoly, let&#x27;s go back and discuss our next steps. Good. The two hurriedly opened the laboratory. Other engineers also had a vague feeling that something was going to happen.</p>
<p>This further accelerated the speed of his work. We will strive to successfully develop controlled nuclear fusion as soon as possible. Lie Jang Wos office. Kobayashi, have you come up with another plan? After pouring Lynch in a cup of tea, Lie Jian Guo sat down in a chair, his eyes full of anticipation. Lynchin nodded slightly.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. The discovery of rare extraterrestrial minerals on the moon is very important for our future development. Maybe other planets in the solar system will have them, too. Therefore, we must accelerate the development of science and technology. And the most important thing for technological development is talent.</p>
<p>Indeed, Lie Jian Guo nodded in agreement. We have talent in all fields in our country. That should be enough. Not enough. Lynch and shook his head.</p>
<p>Far from enough. With future development into space, various scientific research projects will experience explosive growth. The current number of scientific research talents is far from meeting the demand. He wasn&#x27;t exaggerating. A technologically advanced civilization aspires to explore the universe.</p>
<p>Scientific research talent is the most important. What should we do then? Lie Jian Guo frowned slightly. Lin Chens eyes were resolute. Increase the population base. This is the only way.</p>
<p>Only when the population base is large enough will a large number of scientific and technological talents emerge. Population base. Lie Jian Guo was a little puzzled. Isn&#x27;t our great SIA kingdoms population base big enough? Chapter 125. The transformation of offense and defense.</p>
<p>Lynshin said helplessly. It&#x27;s still a long way off. With a level two or higher level of civilization in their home knows this to break through to level two civilization, the number of races often starts in the tens of billions or even hundreds of billions. The Great Sea Kingdom has a population of 1.4 billion. The birth rate is still declining.</p>
<p>How is that enough? Then what should we do? This problem cannot be solved in a short time. Li Jang Guoo was also filled with helplessness. It&#x27;s fine in other aspects. The most difficult issue to resolve is population. Lyn Shun composed himself and then explained his plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, I suggest that the country completely liberalize birth restrictions and we should vigorously encourage child birth. Various incentive measures have been introduced. For example, child support, education fees, and medical expenses will all be waved. The more children you have, the bigger the reward.</p>
<p>Start with people&#x27;s livelihood. At the same time, we will thoroughly solve the problem of people getting sick. Completely solve the problems in people&#x27;s lives. Upon hearing this, Lie Jian Guo was stunned. Shaolin, your plan is too idealistic.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to achieve. Lynch and shook his head. The medical issues can be resolved quickly. The important ones are other issues like child support, education expenses, and housing, which require the government&#x27;s determination. How can medical problems be solved? Ordinary people simply cannot afford to get sick.</p>
<p>Alas, Lie Jian Guo sighed helplessly. Oldly, don&#x27;t you still believe me? Lynchs tone was full of confidence. Could it be? You also have medical expertise. Li Jang Wos eyes lit up instantly. He was all too familiar with Lin Chin&#x27;s expression.</p>
<p>This is how he reacts every time he comes up with a new technology. That&#x27;s right. Lynshin nodded emphatically. But well have to wait until the controlled nuclear fusion project is completed. Among the biotechnology inherited from the space, there is a technology that can solve various intractable diseases on Earth.</p>
<p>He originally planned to wait a while before considering the inheritance of biotechnology, but now it has to be brought forward. Good. I&#x27;ll summarize it in a bit and then report it to my superiors. Li Jian Guo was so excited that he slapped his thigh. He trusted Lin Shun unconditionally.</p>
<p>After all, Lyn Shun has created so many miracles. Moreover, the higher-ups have already agreed to fully support all of Lin Chin&#x27;s plans. I&#x27;m sure this time will be no exception. The process may affect the interests of many people, but for the future of the Great Sia Kingdom, anyone who dares to step forward and try to stop it will suffer a terrible fate. Linshin then suggested.</p>
<p>Professor Lee. In the short term, we also need to bring in top talents from various fields from abroad. That&#x27;s a good suggestion. Lie Jang Guo nodded. Remember, only top-notch scientific research talents should be included.</p>
<p>Those mediocre talents should not be allowed in. Lyn Shun added another instruction. Don&#x27;t worry, Xiain. Well take care of that. Li Jian Gu had it his chest and guaranteed it.</p>
<p>Then the two discussed the specific plan in detail. Lynshin returned to the controlled nuclear fusion laboratory and got busy again. Li Jang Wo also began to organize Linshin&#x27;s proposal, preparing to report it to his superiors. 10 p.m. The sight of the maiden flight of Kuan Ping.</p>
<p>After a 6-hour flight, Kuan Ping one has finally landed successfully on the ground. Captain Jang, we&#x27;re back safely. It feels like a dream. Shiao Wong was filled with emotion. Who could have imagined that it would all happen in just one day? It&#x27;s like traveling from Earth to the moon and back.</p>
<p>The most exciting part was exploring the Atique Basin. This instilled in Xiao Wong a deep longing for exploring the starry sky. Old Jang nodded and solemnly instructed, &quot;Remember, we haven&#x27;t seen anything on the moon. Understand? As a veteran astronaut,&quot; he was fully aware of the sensitivity of this exploration. &quot;Some information once leaked can cause a lot of trouble.&quot; &quot;Clear,&quot; astronaut Shia Wong and others nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>The hatch opened and Lo Jang led Shiao Wong and the others out. At this time, Lie Jian Guo and a group of engineers were already welcoming them. Welcome home, Hero. Welcome, welcome, old Jeang and the others waved with smiles. Immediately afterwards, they stepped off the Kuen Punan.</p>
<p>The medical staff were already prepared. Give them a full physical examination. Not long after, the test results are in. Dean Lee, all their indicators are normal. Upon hearing the result, Lie Jian Guo breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and patted Old Jang on the shoulder. Thank you for your hard work. There&#x27;s a task coming up. A top secret agreement must be signed, and not a single word about anything on the moon can be revealed to the outside world. Old Jang nodded seriously.</p>
<p>Understood. We know the rules. Subsequently, Lao Jang and the others signed a confidentiality agreement. I was arranged to go on vacation. Before leaving, Shiaol Wong glanced back at Coen Pung Wan.</p>
<p>My heart is full of anticipation. He knew that the next trip to the moon would be there will definitely be even bigger discoveries. After the astronauts were arranged, Lie Jian Guo instructed the engineers to take the samples collected from the moon for analysis. At the same time, someone was asked to issue a public announcement. Not long after, the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s internet, which had been quiet for half a day, was once again a buzz with excitement.</p>
<p>Huh? Our kuing one has returned safely. I&#x27;m so happy. It really does take only one day to make a round trip to the moon. A journey to the moon is just around the corner. The great sea kingdom is far ahead.</p>
<p>The announcement issued by the Seyaku Academy. This prompted many of the people of the great Sia Kingdom who had already been resting to get up and celebrate. The street food stalls were packed with customers. They celebrated by eating late night snacks while talking about Kuan Ping. Many people even speculated what Kuan Pung one discovered on the moon.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kuan Pung one returned successfully. This has also disappointed many people internationally. it didn&#x27;t explode. Damn it. What exactly did the great Sea Kingdom do on the moon? Why didn&#x27;t they lose contact in space? Why did they need to return to Earth? Yeah, it would be great if they exploded in space.</p>
<p>Some are happy, some are sad. After seeing the Kuan Pong one return, the wealthy Middle Eastern countries could no longer sit still. They directly dispatched a business team to the great Sia Kingdom to seek cooperation. On the other side, across the Pacific Ocean, the White House of the US, Optton listened to Durit&#x27;s report with a grim expression. The Great Sa Kingdom has actually surpassed us by so much.</p>
<p>Do we have a chance to catch up? Durat shook his head. Almost impossible. Even if it takes another 30 years, we still won&#x27;t be able to catch up with the space plane technology of the great Sia Kingdom. Unless, seeing that Dur seemed hesitant to speak, Optin couldn&#x27;t help but press. Unless what? Just say it.</p>
<p>Dur explained with a rice smile. Unless the great Sia Kingdom is willing to share its technology with us. Optin fell silent. Should the great Sia Kingdom share its technology? Is this possible? But he was unwilling to give up. After a moment&#x27;s thought, Optton said, &quot;Let&#x27;s try contacting the great SEA Kingdom first and see how they react.</p>
<p>If all else fails, we&#x27;ll go back to the original plan and get all the countries to unite and pressure them. At the same time, increase investment in Starship research and development. No matter what, we must achieve a manned lunar landing within 6 months.&quot; He knew it in his heart. If we can&#x27;t keep up with the pace of the Great Sea Kingdom, the United States hegemonic status will completely collapse. Chapter 126 a huge order of 1.35 trillion Ministry of Commerce Great Sia Kingdom since Kuong one successfully returned.</p>
<p>Minister son of the Ministry of Commerce was constantly receiving international phone calls. Minister Sun had just hung up on a call from the French Ministry of Commerce. Raymond from the US Department of Commerce called again. Minister Sun, our American ally is willing to pay 100 billion US in patent fees. by your technology sharing.</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, Secretary of State Raymond was completely unpredictable, but his tone was full of urgency. This shows that the US is really in a hurry this time. Faced with the vast resources of the moon, for those capitalists, that is endless wealth, Minister Sun leaned back in his chair and responded calmly, &quot;Excuse me, Ms. Riiamando. No matter how much money is involved, our great Sia Kingdom will not share technology.&quot; Laying duo still unwilling to give up hurriedly said, &quot;We can provide funding and talent as long as you agree to share the technology.</p>
<p>We can also lift all sanctions against you. It would have been better if sanctions hadn&#x27;t been mentioned.&quot; Upon hearing the mention of sanctions, Minister Sun&#x27;s face instantly turned cold and his voice became icy. Huh? Then you can take your time and punish me. Sorry, cooperation is out of the question. After saying that, he hung up the phone without waiting for Lay Ming to refute him.</p>
<p>After minister son hung up the phone, a cold smile appeared on his lips. Instruct the secretary directly. We rejected all those who came to discuss technical cooperation. These countries now see that the great sea kingdom has developed its technology and think of the great Sia Kingdom. When they imposed sanctions, didn&#x27;t they think about what would happen today? Just a little while later, the secretary knocked and came in.</p>
<p>Minister, the business team from the desert tycoon country has arrived. Wait in the conference room downstairs. Minister son&#x27;s eyes lit up. Let&#x27;s go meet these big spenders. People from other countries can be avoided.</p>
<p>But I must meet with those who are giving me money. In the conference room, Sartra was very uneasy. Upon seeing Minister Sun enter, he immediately stood up to greet him. Minister son, it&#x27;s been a long time. Representative Sartra stepped forward warmly and shook hands with Minister Sun.</p>
<p>We are here today to invest in lunar projects. 100 billion US. If that&#x27;s not enough, we can add more. Minister Sun sat down with a smile and slowly began to speak. Sartra&#x27;s representative.</p>
<p>We currently have no plans for a lunar project. Moreover, even if there were, there probably wouldn&#x27;t be an opportunity for cooperation in the short term. Sartra&#x27;s smile froze and he looked somewhat disappointed. Is there really no chance? He originally thought that as long as the money was enough, it would be fine. The great Sea Kingdom will definitely give them the opportunity to cooperate.</p>
<p>It now appears that the investment in the moon may be doomed. Even representatives from the desert-rich country were filled with disappointment. At this point, the representative from the Arab Emirates continued to ask, &quot;Then we&#x27;ll ask for naming rights. That should be possible, right? For example, the Desert Tycoon&#x27;s lunar base. As long as you can get us involved, we&#x27;re willing to pay any price.</p>
<p>Minister Sun thought for a moment, then spoke. Naming rights should be negotiable. However, we have an additional condition. Sarter&#x27;s eyes lit up instantly. You said it.</p>
<p>As long as we can do it, we plan to export a batch of fourth generation and fifth generation fighter jets. If you have any needs, we can prioritize supplying goods. Sarter&#x27;s representative was stunned for a moment, then overjoyed. Yes, of course we want it. 2004th generation fighters first.</p>
<p>105th generation fighters. Money is not a problem. Of the Arab chief quickly chimed in. Well order the same amount too. Representatives from other wealthy desert nations offered the quantities they needed.</p>
<p>Minister sons eyes lit up and he immediately instructed his secretary to prepare the contract. The secretary quickly printed out the contract and returned to the meeting room. Minister son glanced at it and after finding no problem said with a smile, &quot;Here is the contract. You&#x27;ll be charged 500 million REMBB for a fourth generation fighter jet and 2 billion REMBB for a fifth generation fighter jet. As long as the contract is signed, the naming rights and fighter jet orders will take effect simultaneously.&quot; Sartra picked up the pen and signed without a second thought.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pleasure doing business with you. If the great SA kingdom has any new projects in the future, we&#x27;ll definitely be the first to invest. How about you sell us a space plane? We can add money. Sarter&#x27;s representative was still unwilling to give up. They also want to buy a space plane.</p>
<p>Minister&#x27;s son didn&#x27;t dare to make a decision on his own and laughed it off, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t make that decision either. If we need to export in the future, I&#x27;ll definitely contact you as soon as possible.&quot; Okay, remember that. The Saudi representative stopped pressing the matter and left it at that. Soon, other wealthy desert nations have also signed contracts. This time, the president sold 1,5004th generation fighter jets and 300 fifth generation fighter jets.</p>
<p>Total value 1.35 trillion. The desert rich nation emptied the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s inventory of old warplanes in one fell swoop. The Great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s White Emperor aerospace fighter has now entered mass production. Several aircraft factories are operating at full capacity. We can take 10 aircraft offline every day.</p>
<p>It is expected to happen soon. The seventh generation aerospace fighter jets of the great sea kingdom can replace all current fighter jets. After seeing off the representatives of the desert tycoon country, Minister Son returned to his office grinning from ear to ear. Huh? Rich people are just stupid and have too much money. They actually cleared out all the stockpiled fighter jets in one go.</p>
<p>Old Chin will have to thank me properly now. After his initial excitement, he reported the good news. This completely shocked the higher-ups. In particular, Minister Chun of the General Armaments logistics department learned of the news. I was so excited I slapped my thigh.</p>
<p>On the other side, Lay Manguo was so angry that he jumped up and down after Minister&#x27;s son hung up on him. great SEA Kingdom, since you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for you, then don&#x27;t blame us. She went to find OP in a huff. President, the great Sia Kingdom is outrageous. Not only did they refuse to cooperate, they also threatened to make us pay.</p>
<p>Optin seemed to have anticipated this outcome and was not overly angry since they are not sure about cooperating. Then let&#x27;s proceed according to the original plan, joining forces with other countries to put pressure on the great Sia Kingdom. Okay, I&#x27;ll get right on it. Lay Mingua left excitedly. The high heels clicked loudly on the ground.</p>
<p>Not long after, the United Nations convened a general assembly. The US representative immediately launched an attack. The great SEA Kingdom wants to monopolize the moon&#x27;s resources. This is an encroachment on the common property of Earth. We must make them share technology and open up manned lunar landing technology.</p>
<p>Representatives from other allied countries echoed this sentiment. South Korean representative. That&#x27;s right. The moon belongs to all mankind. The representative from India said, &quot;The great sea kingdom not only wants to share its technology but also to provide us with free technical support.&quot; The representative from the squid kingdom stated, &quot;Even if the great sea kingdom does not share its technology, the lunar resources it extracts must be equally distributed among all the nations of our blue star.</p>
<p>Almost every country in the US-led coalition has spoken out in condemnation. Even the Russian Empire got involved. Only the wealthy desert nations stood up to refute this. The Saudi representative said, &quot;You are nothing but bandits. You want the great Sia Kingdom to share your technology.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re so capable, go and collect it from the moon yourselves.&quot; The Arab world said, &quot;That&#x27;s right. The resources on the moon are unclaimed. Whoever can develop them owns them. If you don&#x27;t like it, go up there yourselves.&quot; A group of Saudi national representatives stood up and angrily denounced the representatives of the US-led coalition. They just purchased a large number of fighter jets from the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>With the great sea kingdom backing them up, they are not afraid of anyone now. Criticize everything and everyone. They don&#x27;t even take the United States, which they used to fear, seriously. Representatives from the US-led coalition also launched counterattacks against the representatives of the desert rich nations. The entire meeting resembled the scene of shrewish women yelling in the street.</p>
<p>Only Schwangu, the representative of the great Sia Kingdom, remained calm as he watched their performance. After a long silence, UN General Assembly Secretary General Guerrishious slammed his hand on the table and then shouted, &quot;Quiet down now. Please welcome the representative of the great Sia Kingdom to give a speech.&quot; Instantly, the entire conference room fell silent. At this moment, Schwangu remained calm and spoke in a cold voice. &quot;Everyone, all of you, please stop arguing.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll just say one thing. Why should I share my technology with you? The American representative instantly turned ashenfaced and shamelessly retorted. The moon belongs to all mankind. Your monopolistic practices have disrupted the peace of earth. Oh, Schwangu calmly said, &quot;Oh, then scoffed.</p>
<p>We have a monopoly. So what? You&#x27;re not convinced. If you&#x27;re so capable, why don&#x27;t you try monopolizing the moon landing yourself?&quot; After saying that, Schwangu got up and left. The representative from the desert-rich country made a few more disdainful remarks and then left as well. The representatives of the US-led alliance were left in the meeting room, furious but helpless.</p>
<p>the great sea kingdom is too arrogant. I suggest that the great sea kingdom be expelled from the general assembly. The American representative was furious and made such an extreme suggestion. The words had barely left his mouth. The expressions of other national representatives changed drastically instantly.</p>
<p>Many expressed their opposition. Joke. The Great Sea Kingdom is so powerful now. If it weren&#x27;t for the constraints imposed on the Great Sea Kingdom by the United Nations General Assembly, wouldn&#x27;t the Great Sia Kingdom then be able to attack whomever it wanted? They would never do something so stupid. Seeing the opposition from the crowd, the American representative could only leave in a huff.</p>
<p>He needs to report this news back. Let the US impose sanctions on the Great Sa Kingdom. Chapter 127 declares the moon belongs to the great SIA kingdom. Eagle, the oval office of the White House. Optin gripped the phone, his face terribly grim.</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, the American UN representative was incessantly complaining. President, the UN General Assembly talks have broken down. The Great Sea Kingdom has a very tough stance, saying that if you don&#x27;t agree, go to war with them. Furthermore, all the countries in the desert region are siding with the great SEA kingdom and opposing us. After hearing this, Opton angrily slammed down the phone.</p>
<p>He stood up abruptly, his chest heaving violently. a bunch of idiots who only know how to sell oil. Have they forgotten who helped them maintain their power? And the Great Sea Kingdom, how dare they be so arrogant? Thinking back to half a year ago, when the Great Sea Kingdom was oppressed by the United States, it was still submissive and compliant. They were on their way to learn the scriptures, yet they already dared to trample on them and act arrogantly. Once upon a time, these are all their subtexts.</p>
<p>They frequently launched wars against other countries. Now, however, the situation has reversed. All of this made Optin feel frustrated. But they had no way to deal with the great Sia Kingdom. At this moment, Lay Ming Duo rushed in wearing high heels.</p>
<p>Her face was so wrinkled it could almost trap a mosquito and she cried out in a panic. President, breaking news. Those lunatics from the great Sia Kingdom have sold a large number of advanced fourth and fifth generation fighter jets to countries in desert regions. Expected to exceed 1 trillion. Optin became even angrier upon hearing this news.</p>
<p>Are those countries courting death? If I can&#x27;t deal with the great sea kingdom, can I at least deal with them? Go and call Pete here. Yes, Mr. President Lay Ming Duo was about to turn around. The secretary rushed in, her face filled with panic, and reported in a trembling voice, &quot;President, the Great Sa Kingdom. The Great Sa Kingdom just issued an announcement.&quot; Optin&#x27;s heart sank.</p>
<p>Read. Announcement content: Lunar Resources first come, first served. The Great Sea Kingdom has completed its first man lunar landing and has gained actual control over the moon. From this day forward, the moon shall be under the jurisdiction of the great SIA kingdom. Those who disagree may attempt to conquer the moon themselves, but you&#x27;ll have to bear the consequences.</p>
<p>Bang! Optin clenched his fist and slammed it hard on the table. My chest heaved violently as if it were about to explode. Rebellion, rebellion. They&#x27;re trying to monopolize the entire space. Laying Duo and his secretary stood aside, not daring to utter a sound.</p>
<p>The great Sia Kingdom issued such a strong statement. It&#x27;s obvious they want to monopolize all the resources on the moon. If another country were to issue such an announcement, they&#x27;ll just watch it for fun at most. But the Great Sea Kingdom happens to have the capability to develop lunar resources. Only the Great Sa Kingdom has this capability.</p>
<p>A moment later, Opton calmed down and said in a deep voice, &quot;Continue to increase investment in space research and development. We are calling on all top talents from around the world. We must successfully land people on the moon before the great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s lunar base is completed. This is our last chance, America. Lay Mangdu nodded.</p>
<p>Shall we convene a congressional meeting now? Go. Oppon waved his hand. He understood. It&#x27;s definitely impossible to confront the great Sia kingdom headon right now. Only by striving to catch up can we succeed.</p>
<p>This is their last chance. At the same time, the red announcement title on the official website of the Ministry of Commerce of the Great Sea Kingdom was particularly eye-catching. In just 10 minutes, the number of reposts exceeded 100 million. The comments section below various reposted articles is filled with excitement. Holy crap, that&#x27;s so awesome.</p>
<p>Haha, this is awesome. This is the benefit of technological development. Which bastards were the ones who said technological development was useless? Come out here and take a few steps. I feel like I&#x27;m dreaming. In just 6 months, the country has become so powerful.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#x27;s like divine intervention. The announcement was widely circulated among the people of the great Sia Kingdom. People could be seen talking about it everywhere on the street. Their eyes were filled with excitement and pride. Even taxi drivers on the street couldn&#x27;t help but roll down their windows and shout along.</p>
<p>The moon belongs to us. I&#x27;m so happy. Even the countryside was filled with excitement. In a certain place, villagers sat together, looking at the announcement. Everyone was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Hooray! Our country has finally risen up. Let&#x27;s see which country dares to talk back now. Well just wipe them out. The moon will belong to our great Sa Kingdom from now on. Anyone who tries to take it will be crushed.</p>
<p>Some even set off firecrackers to celebrate. The crackling sounds were like a New Year celebration. On the international internet, however, the scene is quite different. Comments from American nizens were filled with anger. This is hijgemony from the great SIA kingdom.</p>
<p>The moon belongs to all mankind and must be shared. Upton get our starships to the moon right now. We want to conquer the moon, too. American nizens are finally experiencing what it feels like to be bullied. They used to be the ones who were superior and bullied others.</p>
<p>Now that their identities have been reversed, they can&#x27;t accept it. At the same time, even the few little idiots in Japan who have internet access joined in the fun. Baka, how dare the great Sia Kingdom? The Great Sia Kingdom is a robber actually trying to monopolize the moon. We absolutely cannot let the Great Sia Kingdom succeed. Eagle, you&#x27;re in charge.</p>
<p>The comment section was full of angry emojis, especially considering how miserable their lives are now. The root cause of all this lies with the Great Sea Kingdom. It was because of the great Sia Kingdom that the economy of their cherry blossom kingdom regressed by 80 years. South Korean nizens are once again displaying their shamelessness. Damn it.</p>
<p>The great Sia Kingdom must have stolen our technology again. Their scientists must have ancestors from South Korea. We must make those scientists return to our South Korean country to acknowledge their ancestors. But nobody responded to them. Let them bark like dogs and act arrogantly.</p>
<p>on the other side. European Union Space Agency. Marco stared at the announcement and sighed heavily. It&#x27;s over. We have absolutely no chance with lunar resources.</p>
<p>The French scientists standing nearby shook his head. We had previously considered cooperating with the Great Sa Kingdom. Now it seems they don&#x27;t need us at all. John Bull scientists clenched their fists. Then what do we do? Are we just going to watch the Great Sa Kingdom monopolize space? No one answered.</p>
<p>The only sound in the conference room was heavy breathing. Ultimately, they could only place their hopes on the US. They decided to join forces with the US to develop starships. We will strive to send a man lunar mission as soon as possible, then occupy some lunar resources. Otherwise, the moon would really have been swallowed up by the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>On the other side, the capital of India, Demo Laen is currently live streaming a grand press conference. He looked arrogant as he faced the camera. Hello everyone. I hereby announce that India will have a manned lunar landing in one week. One week later, our astronauts will fly out of Earth.</p>
<p>We also want to plant the Indian flag on the moon. The great Sia kingdom wants to monopolize the moon. Dream on. He waved his arms, spitting everywhere. The Indian people at the scene were filled with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Long live the divine ox. Long live India&#x27;s motherland. Our India is the strongest. Those Indians were all acting like they&#x27;ve been injected with adrenaline. They firmly believe that Demo Laosen would dare to hold a public press conference.</p>
<p>I definitely have enough confidence. In the live stream room, Indian nizens were even more excited. Very good. It&#x27;s finally time for our India to rise. Let the great SA kingdom see who the true space superpower is.</p>
<p>This time we must let the whole world witness the greatness of our India. Chapter 128. India has flown away. In the office of the Indian Space Agency, the engineers stared at the screen, their faces grim. The old engineer leger clutched his hair, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s insane. He&#x27;s absolutely insane. We can&#x27;t even guarantee the success of man near Earth space flight. So, how can the premiere announce a man lunar landing? Young engineer admit, his eyes red rimmed, threw down the blueprints in his hand. Our man rocket has only just been assembled and hasn&#x27;t even been tested yet.</p>
<p>How can it fly? This is sending astronauts to their deaths. They never dreamed that old immortal demo would be so radical. The entire NASA engineering team seemed to have lost their souls, leaving only desparing size. Regarding Demo Lashian&#x27;s live broadcast announcement, this is completely different from the announcement issued by the Great Sa Kingdom on the international internet. The mockery was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Did that Indian Eid expired curry? Does he want to go to the moon? I suggest just strapping Demo the old man onto a rocket to save the astronauts. Baka, we didn&#x27;t even dare to talk about landing on the moon. So, what makes them think they can? Just wait and see the rocket explode and become a laughing stock. Damn it. India is just here to make a joke.</p>
<p>Do they think they&#x27;re the great Sea Kingdom? Nizens around the world are waiting to see India make a fool of itself. India, a country that frequently fails even when launching satellites. They actually want to send people to the moon. Isn&#x27;t that a joke? At the same time, governments around the world have completely ignored it. When Optton saw the news at the White House, he sneered.</p>
<p>Let them do what they want. Once their rocket explodes, we&#x27;ll take the opportunity to promote the second test flight of Starship. European countries and others simply don&#x27;t bother with it. They focused on negotiating cooperative development with the United States. The great Sia Kingdom completely ignored the Indian Kingdom&#x27;s declaration.</p>
<p>If India really has the capability to land on the moon, then that&#x27;s something they&#x27;ve accomplished. As for whether or not lunar resources can be developed, that&#x27;s another matter. Even Lynn Chin knew about this news. He just laughed it off. Does India want to get its hands on lunar resources? Even if the divine ox were to descend, it wouldn&#x27;t save them, especially after he learned that there were star stones on the moon.</p>
<p>They treat the moon as their own backyard and would not allow others to trespass on it at will. Which country dares to covet lunar resources? He dared to let the great Sia Kingdom launch a war directly. One week fleeting Arab Space Launch Center. The scene was packed with Indian children waving Indian flags. The speaker was playing Demo&#x27;s speech on a loop.</p>
<p>Today is the day India rises. We will become the second country to land a man on the moon. The number of viewers in the live stream exceeded 10 million. Indian nizens flooded the screen with comments with the screen completely covered in bullet comments. Go for it.</p>
<p>We will win. Astronauts are heroes. We have the protection of the divine bull. We will definitely succeed in landing on the moon. However, on the launch pad, the rocket stands on the launch pad.</p>
<p>From a distance, it looks like a giant tombstone. The three astronauts were wearing bulky space suits. Standing beside the rocket, his face showed no excitement, only despair. A young astronaut asked in a low voice, &quot;Team leader, can we come back?&quot; Captain Singh shook his head with a bitter smile, his expression filled with sorrow. Have no idea, but we have no other choice.</p>
<p>The government has purchased insurance for us and promised to take care of our families. He looked up at the sky. Singh closed his eyes and a tear slid down his cheek. On the viewing platform, Demo the Immortal looked radiant. He held the microphone and shouted excitedly, &quot;Fellow countrymen, today you will witness firsthand the greatness of our Indian aerospace technology.</p>
<p>Now let our great astronaut warriors board the spacecraft. The words had barely left his mouth. The Indian boys around them were completely excited and shouted, &quot;Go warriors! You are a hero of our India. We have the protection of the divine bull. You will definitely be able to land on the moon safely.&quot; Singh and his two companions felt even more distressed as they looked at the excited Indian children.</p>
<p>But they still forced a smile and waved to the Indians below. Then they began boarding the rocket crew capsule. A moment later, the hatch closed. From the viewing platform, Demo the old immortal shouted excitedly. Countdown begins.</p>
<p>10 9 8 7 6 5 The crowd at the scene joined in the chanting. The sound was deafening. They were all filled with fervor. They just didn&#x27;t know that. Inside the rocket capsule, Sing and the other two felt like they were on a death countdown.</p>
<p>With every second they lost, they felt one second closer to death. 4 3 2 1 ignition. Demo. The immortal suddenly swung his arm down. White smoke began to rise from the bottom of the rocket.</p>
<p>Boom. A tremendous roar resounded and flames shot into the sky. Immediately afterwards, the protective bracket automatically retracts. Then the rocket slowly rose into the air, its speed increasing. The crowd went wild.</p>
<p>Some knelt in prayer while others cheered with joy. It&#x27;s flying. It&#x27;s flying. We did it. Long live the divine bull.</p>
<p>Long live India. The excitement that resonated among those young Indians was palpable. It can only be described as insane. Even the Indian people watching the live broadcast on television were completely excited and cheering. See that our rocket has taken off.</p>
<p>Great Sia Kingdom. Are you afraid? The moon can only belong to our India. They seem to have come to believe that as long as the rocket can fly, it will be fine. It will definitely be able to fly out of Earth and then successfully land on the moon. In contrast, consider the engineers at the Indian Space Agency.</p>
<p>I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Phew, at least I didn&#x27;t explode on the spot. This can be considered good news for them. As long as the rocket doesn&#x27;t explode on the spot again, then they can be considered successful. As for what will happen next, none of that matters.</p>
<p>At the same time, nizens from various countries were somewhat surprised. What? It can fly? He he actually got up. Looks like we&#x27;re going to have a big aerial fireworks display. Not bad. Not bad.</p>
<p>India has made progress this time. It&#x27;s no longer just exploding on the spot. The rocket from India took off successfully. This did not stop international nizens from mocking them. This on the contrary aroused their even stronger desire to make fun of them.</p>
<p>They firmly believed that India&#x27;s rockets would definitely explode. India viewing platform. As Demo watched the rocket launch, he laughed triumphantly and shouted into the microphone, &quot;Did you see that? This is the strength of India. A week from now, we will announce to the world from the moon that the moon belongs to our India.&quot; On the viewing platform, other high-ranking officials from the Indian countries came forward to offer their congratulations. The prime minister is wise.</p>
<p>India will surely rise. Demo the immortal grinned from ear to ear, but his heart was pounding. He was well aware of the capabilities of their Indian rockets, but he will disconnect the live stream as soon as he can fly out of Earth. Then information is released to the outside world using simulated animation. Whether the rocket explodes or the moon landing is successful, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</p>
<p>All he wants is for his country India to be able to conduct man space flight. Chapter 129. India is in trouble. The US delivers the finishing blow. While the entire nation of India was celebrating, their rockets have entered the blackout zone.</p>
<p>At the same time, it also lost contact with the ground. Because India has not yet broken through the technology of communication in the dark. Just as the rocket entered the blackout zone, the alarm inside the rocket crew cabin suddenly went off. Beep beep beep. Energy pipeline ruptured.</p>
<p>Energy leak. Astronaut Singh turned deathly pale instantly. His eyes filled with despair. Damn it. Is it really inevitable that I can&#x27;t escape it after all? The young astronaut&#x27;s voice trembled.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on? Is something really going to happen? Another astronaut, pale-faced, stared at the red flashing instrument panel. The thrusters. The thrusters are going out of control, too. We&#x27;re doomed. They seem to have anticipated this outcome.</p>
<p>I already know this time it&#x27;s really over. Really? Their guess was correct. After the malfunction alarm sounded, the entire rocket began to vibrate violently for a very long time. Sweat beated on Singh&#x27;s forehead. He was unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>He also attempted to manually correct the tracks, his fingers flying across the control panel. The data on the screen kept changing wildly, and all commands seemed to disappear without a trace. It&#x27;s over. Even the control system has failed. Sing has completely given up.</p>
<p>Despair overwhelmed my heart like a tidal wave. He turned to look at his companion. The young astronaut&#x27;s eyes were red- rimmed and his lips trembled as he couldn&#x27;t speak. Another astronaut closed his eyes, tears streaming down his face. The young astronaut suddenly burst into tears.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t even have a chance to say goodbye to my parents. I don&#x27;t want to die. However, the cabin vibrated more and more violently, and the sound of metal twisting was piercing. Flames began to rise outside the port hole, and the high temperature in the darkened area began to scorch the hall. Sing tried to suppress his fear and calm himself down.</p>
<p>He tried to comfort the other two young astronauts. you. They haven&#x27;t finished speaking yet. Boom. After a terrifying explosion, the rocket disintegrated in the darkness.</p>
<p>Singh and his two companions were blown to pieces. Ground. India&#x27;s space agency. We finally made it into the blackout zone. Once you get through the blackout zone, you&#x27;re halfway there.</p>
<p>The engineers breathe the sigh of relief. Now they just need to wait quietly. However, time passed by minute by minute. The scheduled time to break through the black barrier has arrived. The communication screen was still filled with static.</p>
<p>There is no indication of any signal connection. The engineer&#x27;s relaxed state of mind instantly tightened. Engineer Ragnar&#x27;s heart was in his throat. What&#x27;s going on? Why is there still no signal after the allotted time has passed? Engineer Amit&#x27;s eyes were filled with worry. Could it be? Could it be? He dared not say the next few words.</p>
<p>The other engineers also started to panic. Isn&#x27;t it supposed to only take 3 minutes to break through the blackout zone? How come 5 minutes have passed and we still haven&#x27;t been able to make contact? All the engineers seem to have guessed what was going on, their eyes filled with fear and unease. They looked at each other. After a moment, engineer Rajel said in a deep voice, &quot;Report the situation to the prime minister.&quot; All the engineers nodded in agreement. Given the current situation, it&#x27;s certain that something has happened to their rocket.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we wouldn&#x27;t be unable to contact them. On the other side, Demo the Immortal was still chatting happily with high-ranking officials from India. We await the good news of the rocket&#x27;s successful launch into space. Just then, the secretary rushed over in a panic and whispered in Demo&#x27;s ear, &quot;Prime Minister, Rocket.&quot; Rocket lost contact in the blackout zone. Still no signal after the scheduled time.</p>
<p>The smile on Demo Old Immortals&#x27;s face vanished instantly. His face turned ashen and he grabbed the secretary&#x27;s collar. What did you say? It&#x27;s true. The secretary gave a definitive answer with a long face. Demo the immortal took a deep breath and suddenly let go.</p>
<p>The secretary collapsed to the ground, panting heavily. Dmo, the old immortal&#x27;s eyes flickered and he suddenly let out a cold laugh. What do you mean missing? Our spacecraft has successfully broken through the atmosphere. He turned and walked backstage. A group of officials were left looking at each other in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Soon, Demo Laosian walked in front of the live broadcast camera. His face once again wore the fake smile that seemed to belong to Ybuchan. Fellow countrymen, I have some great news to announce. Our spacecraft has successfully entered space. Soon, we will fly towards the moon.</p>
<p>Everyone, please look at the big screen. The camera followed Timothy&#x27;s hand and moved to the big screen. At this moment, the screen has switched to another display. The Indian spacecraft is currently flying in near-Earth orbit. This is a simulated animation that Demo Laosen had prepared in advance.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s something they&#x27;re worried about using to deceive the whole world when something goes wrong. The moment I saw the big screen, Shia, who was near the viewing platform, instantly became excited. Haha, we&#x27;ve successfully completed our man space flight. The moon, we from India have arrived. Long live the prime minister.</p>
<p>Those people were unaware that they had been scammed. They were still excited at that moment, even those Indians watching TV. He was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes and he shouted, &quot;Long live the divine ox.&quot; In the live stream, the comment section was filled with India is the strongest. Even international nizens were a bit confused. Some observant people have noticed that the so-called real-time footage released by India is actually just an animation.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to expose India, the US space agency suddenly released a video. in the video clearly shows the Indian rocket exploding in the dark area. Flames shot into the sky and fragments scattered everywhere. The video went viral instantly after it was released. Comments from American nizens.</p>
<p>Huh, I knew it would explode. Is this India&#x27;s space technology? Old immortal demo is still lying. Comments from netzens in the great sea kingdom. Hilarious. You&#x27;re really good at simulating animation.</p>
<p>Three astronauts died in vain. Is this what they call the protection of the divine cow? International public opinion reversed instantly. India instantly became a joke. People on the street watched the explosion video on their phones. The smile on his face froze and then he burst into an angry roar.</p>
<p>Liar. Demo the immortal is a liar. Where are astronauts? Give us the truth. They all rushed toward the old man. Demo on the viewing platform.</p>
<p>We demand an explanation from him. India&#x27;s space agency. The engineers watched the video released by the US. They all slumped into their chairs. Leer covered his face, tears streaming through his fingers.</p>
<p>What a tragedy. We killed three heroes. Demo the immortal looked at the public opinion on his phone and trembled with anger. American, you dare ruin my plans. Just you wait.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t let you get away with this. Just then. First, prime minister. A large number of people. The people have stormed in.</p>
<p>They want they want an explanation from you. Dimmo the immortal&#x27;s face turned deathly pale. Quickly take me away from here. Then Demo the Immortal was escorted by bodyguards and left through a secret passage. The high-ranking officials of the other three countries also left.</p>
<p>These are all experiences. A moment later, the Indian people rushed in only to find that old man Demo had already fled. They were all filled with anger. Let&#x27;s go to the government building. We absolutely need an explanation from Demo the Immortal.</p>
<p>With someone taking the lead, the surrounding Indians swarmed towards the government building. Uprisings broke out throughout the entire country of India. Chapter 130. Flying car development successfully completed. Office of the Prime Minister of the three Arab countries.</p>
<p>Demo. The immortal slammed the door shut as he entered, his face terribly grim. A group of high-ranking officials followed them in, not daring to breathe loudly. The US dares to stab me in the back. This grudge must be avenged.</p>
<p>Issue an announcement immediately. Just say that the US company supplied us with substandard parts, causing major accidents to our rockets. Confiscate all their property in our country. Demo the immortal ripped off his hat and roared. He had always been very envious of the wealth of those companies in the United States.</p>
<p>I was just worried about not finding an excuse. The US has run into trouble this time, so don&#x27;t blame them. The high-ranking officials from India who were listening were speechless. These excuses are really a bit. The director of the foreign affairs department unable to bear it any longer tried to persuade him.</p>
<p>Prime Minister wouldn&#x27;t this demo the old immortal interrupted him directly. Shut up. Who have we Indians ever been afraid of? If the US is not satisfied, let them come find me. Upon seeing this, other high-ranking officials from India looked at each other, not daring to offer any further advice. The director of the foreign affairs department had no choice but to go out and issue a public announcement.</p>
<p>Once the announcement was issued, the Indians who were originally rioting instantly quieted down. I never imagined it was those damned American companies that caused this. We must take revenge. We must make the US pay the price. Seize their entire company to make up for our losses.</p>
<p>Those Indians turned their attention to those American companies. Some people who live near American companies gathered and went to surround and blockade companies invested in by the United States. It seems that all the Indians have found a new outlet for their frustrations. On the other side, the White House Oval Office owned by the US Navy. Optin was overjoyed to see the expression on the face of the old immortal demo from India.</p>
<p>Huh, that idiot demo has finally lost his temper. Let them screw us over before and mock our starship. Durret and Pete exchanged a glance and then laughed. President, they sold us fake valves which caused our Starship launch to be delayed. Now they&#x27;ve reaped what they sowed and this revenge has finally been taken.</p>
<p>Optin smile faded and he tapped his fingers on the table. How much did we lose because of those fake valves? Trudeau immediately replied, &quot;A direct loss of $5 billion and a 3-month delay in development.&quot; Optin&#x27;s eyes turned cold. This score isn&#x27;t going to be settled so easily. He changed the subject looking at Durit. How&#x27;s the Starship rocket project progressing? Durret straightened up and quickly reported.</p>
<p>Mr. President, thanks to improvements in the involvement of aerospace scientists from European countries, the development of Starship has accelerated considerably. The safety test for the man cabin have all been passed. Now we await your order to determine the launch time. Optin nodded, a hint of excitement flashing in his eyes.</p>
<p>Good. issue an announcement immediately. One month from now, we will conduct the second man starship lunar landing. We want the whole world to know that we, the Americans, can also send people to the moon. The great SA kingdom wants to monopolize the moon&#x27;s resources.</p>
<p>Dream on. Yes, Mr. President. Trudeau nodded. He now has full confidence in Starship.</p>
<p>This time, it&#x27;s not like the first time where they force me into it. European aerospace scientists have joined the team. inspired by the space plane of the great sea kingdom discovered by the starship have been completely resolved. Dur believes that this time they will definitely be able to successfully land a man on the moon soon. The announcement has been issued.</p>
<p>Two reactions have emerged within the United States. Supporters waved national flags and cheered in the streets. Great. We&#x27;re finally about to catch up with the great Sia Kingdom. Long live the US.</p>
<p>We will succeed. Keep it up. Our eagle will always be the strongest. Meanwhile, there are also various dissenting voices on the American internet. Has the reason why the starship almost disintegrated last time been resolved? Why is it happening again? Don&#x27;t let it turn into fireworks in the sky again.</p>
<p>That would be so embarrassing. If there are any problems this time, have Muscola a shot. Many Americans no longer trust the American government because what they did was simply too outrageous. None of them made them feel at ease. Regardless of how the US reacts domestically, internationally, the allied countries of the United States sent congratulatory messages.</p>
<p>European countries, South Korean countries, and Southeast Asian countries have all expressed their congratulations. We hope that the US-led alliance will unite to jointly develop lunar resources. Only the official government of the great Sia Kingdom. There was no response to the US announcement. Just do what you&#x27;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s as if the US&#x27;s moon landing program is just an insignificant joke. The whole world is eyeing the resources on the moon. Only Japan, the land of cherry blossoms, hides in a corner, licking its wounds. The prime minister&#x27;s official residence in Japan. Kishidajiro sat on the sofa, his face gloomy.</p>
<p>The minister of the interior bowed his head and reported in a trembling voice. Your excellency, the domestic power shortage problem remains unresolved. Many factories have not yet resumed operations and the public is full of complaints. In some places, power outages have even sparked riots. Kishaurro slammed his fist on the table and roared, &quot;Damn the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>If it weren&#x27;t for them, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation.&quot; Although there is still no direct evidence to prove that the Great Sa Kingdom launched the bombing against them. However, the fact that the Great Sa Kingdom mentioned it multiple times later is sufficient proof. He had to avenge this with a gloomy face. He asked, &quot;How&#x27;s Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s progress? When will he be able to complete the mass production of the biochemical bacteria? And what&#x27;s the progress on the bowarrior?&quot; The minister of the interior quickly replied, &quot;The progress so far is not ideal.</p>
<p>Last time, due to rushing the schedule, there was almost a leak of biological bacteria. Now, even Dr. Kawashima doesn&#x27;t dare to be radical anymore.&quot; Kishaurro was silent for a few seconds, then spoke. Tell him he absolutely mustn&#x27;t leak this. But the progress must also be guaranteed.</p>
<p>I will make the great Sia Kingdom pay a terrible price. Yes, sir. The minister of the interior dared not say more, responded with a sound of agreement, and hurriedly withdrew. Jurro Kishida looked out the window, his expression complex. The Great Sa Kingdom, you wait.</p>
<p>You want to monopolize the moon&#x27;s resources? Dream on. The great Sia Kingdom, Xiaawa Academy of Sciences, Lie Jang Wos office. Lynchin looked at the news on the screen and smiled. Huh, we didn&#x27;t even have to lift a finger. They just blew themselves up.</p>
<p>The Indians are just here to make us laugh. Lie Jiano laughed and said, &quot;Those Indians love to aim too high. They&#x27;re destined to fail.&quot; Lynchin nodded slightly. The US is still not giving up. They still want to send people to the moon.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo snorted dismissively. Their starship is only half finished. They&#x27;re far from being able to compete with us for lunar resources. A playful smile appeared on Linchen&#x27;s lips. Even if they succeed, I will make them fail.</p>
<p>The moon belongs to the great Sia Kingdom. Anyone who comes here will die. Just then, an engineer knocked on the door and came in, his face full of excitement. Chief Engineer Lynn Deanley, great news. The flying car has been successfully developed.</p>
<p>Chapter 131. you call a Mach 5 civilian flying car. The engineer had barely finished speaking. Lynn Shanun was pleasantly surprised. The flying car has been successfully developed.</p>
<p>He has always left the racing car to its own devices. He made the request while protecting himself. The rest is left to the relevant engineers and car manufacturers to conduct joint research and development. According to his plan, it is estimated that it will take about 3 months to develop successfully. Unexpectedly, only 2 months have passed.</p>
<p>Now they have developed the flying car. It is clear that engineers are making very rapid progress. Li Jang Wo was so excited that he stood up and asked eagerly, &quot;Has the flying car really been developed? Have all performance indicators met the standards?&quot; The engineer nodded vigorously and pulled a tablet out of his pocket. Dean Chief Engineer Lynn, look, these are the final test data. Top speed, Mach 5, approximately 6,125 kmh.</p>
<p>Driving range 5,000 km. Charging time 5 minutes. Fast charging mode. Takeoff and landing method. Vertical takeoff and landing.</p>
<p>No runway required. Fully automated driving. No human intervention required. Equipped with a downgraded version of 3D visual radar. Safe and reliable.</p>
<p>Manufacturing cost 100,000 yuan per vehicle for the basic version. Lynshin nodded in satisfaction and smiled. Not bad. It completely meets my requirements. On the contrary, Li Jian Guo was deeply shocked.</p>
<p>Shaolin, you&#x27;re right to call the civilian flying car Mach 5. Just five more minutes of charging and you can run 5,000 km. The cost is only 100,000 yuan. That&#x27;s outrageous. He repeatedly checked the data, so shocked that he was incoherent.</p>
<p>He knew about the flying car project, but he didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the specific parameters. He felt very reassured because Lynchin was in charge. The parameters turned out to be incredibly absurd. That&#x27;s a civilian flying car. It&#x27;s almost as fast as the speed of the US&#x27;s sixth generation fighter jets.</p>
<p>Lynch waved his hand and said calmly, &quot;Oldly, this is normal. After all, our country is so big, so the speed is bound to be faster.&quot; Mach 5 is the fastest speed. In fact, intelligent driving will automatically adjust the speed according to the journey. The engineer added with a smile. Chief engineer Lynn is right.</p>
<p>The body materials, intelligent driving system, and powertrain are all based on the same stripped down version as Bidey. Safety is absolutely guaranteed. Lie Jian Guo took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. Walk. Let&#x27;s head to the test field now.</p>
<p>I want to see it with my own eyes. Lynch nodded in agreement. He also wanted to see what the flying car would ultimately look like. Most importantly, after getting the flying car, the transportation of the great sea kingdom will directly enter the lowaltitude era in coordination with various policies that benefit people&#x27;s livelihoods. This can completely solve the problem of the people of the Great Sa Kingdom having to leave home to work.</p>
<p>It allows people who work away from home to easily go home after get off work every day. A civilian version of the flying car has been released. A public transportation version could also be developed. By then, flying cars will be used for all travel across the country. It greatly saves travel time.</p>
<p>Even from Mole, the northernmost city of the Great Sea Kingdom, to Chiong Hai province, the southernmost city, it is only a little over 5,000 km. It will take less than an hour to get there. Moreover, since it&#x27;s an autonomous driving system, there&#x27;s absolutely no need to worry about driver fatigue. Although mass production of flying cars will impact many industries, but it&#x27;s just a temporary pain. The development effects brought about by the future flying car will only make the entire great SIA kingdom more prosperous.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, flying car test center. A futuristic silver white flying car was parked in an open space. It has a streamlined fuselov, no wheels, and an anti-gravity plasma engine mounted on the bottom like a miniature spaceship. Lynchin looked at the flying cars design and nodded in satisfaction. Lie Jiano had already circled the flying car twice.</p>
<p>He kept muttering to himself. Perfect. Stunning. He couldn&#x27;t resist reaching out and tapping the fusel off. The more I look at it, the more satisfied I become.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lie Jian Guo reluctantly left the flying car. Kobayashi, let&#x27;s begin the test. Lynshin turned to the engineer and asked, &quot;There shouldn&#x27;t be any problem, right?&quot; The engineer patted his chest and guaranteed. Chief Engineer Lynn Dean Lee, don&#x27;t worry. We&#x27;ve already tested it and we guarantee there won&#x27;t be any problems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have already reported to the air traffic control bureau and can test it at any time. Lie Jian Guo exclaimed excitedly. Okay, let&#x27;s start the test now. The engineer nodded and walked toward the flying car. After closing the car door, directly issue a command to the autonomous driving system.</p>
<p>The car starts moving. Buzz. Pale blue air flow was emitted from the bottom of the flying car. The car slowly rose into the air. It was as stable as a feather suspended in the air at an altitude of 1,000 m.</p>
<p>Vertical takeoff and landing successful. Test the speed now. In an instant, the car accelerated sharply. Was generated directly in the air. Mach 1, Mach 2, Mach 3, until it stopped at Mach 5.</p>
<p>They really achieved a top speed of Mach 5. That speed from Beijing to Shanghai, it only takes 10 minutes. Lie Jian Guo rubbed his eyes. his face full of shock. I used to think highspeed rail was fast, but compared to this, it&#x27;s like a snail crawling.</p>
<p>Lynshan nodded in satisfaction. It&#x27;s really good. Not long after, the flying car returned to the field. The engineer stepped down. Lyn Shan continued to ask the engineer, &quot;Is the one costing 100,000 the basic version?&quot; The engineer nodded, &quot;Yes.&quot; Besides the basic version, there are three other versions.</p>
<p>Advanced version 200,000. Deluxe version 300,000. The luxury version costs 1 million. Lynchin pondered for a moment, then proposed again at a more affordable version. The cost is kept below 50,000 and the final selling price is 50,000.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, evenly Gian Guo was stunned. Shaolin, isn&#x27;t 50,000 too cheap? No. Lynch shook his head. We can cut out the unnecessary functions. The range has been reduced to 3,000 km and the speed has been reduced to Mach 2, but safety must be guaranteed.</p>
<p>50,000. The engineer was completely dumbfounded. This won&#x27;t there be any profit? Lynshan, profit is not the focus as long as safety is guaranteed. I want to make it affordable for ordinary people to enable every family to drive a flying car. This is the true meaning of our research and development of flying cars.</p>
<p>Only cheaper flying cars. Only then can it be popularized among the entire population. Only products that are widely available to the general public are good products. As for profits, it&#x27;s entirely possible to earn that money from abroad. Lie Jian Guo looked at Lyn Shun and suddenly understood.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this exactly what Lynshan mentioned before about improving people&#x27;s livelihoods? He patted Lyn Shun on the shoulder. Okay, we&#x27;ll do it your way. We&#x27;re announcing that we&#x27;ll be hosting a live streamed launch event for the racing game tomorrow. Let the people of the whole country see our achievements. Okay.</p>
<p>Lynchin nodded. Once the announcement was issued, the entire internet in the great Sea Kingdom was stunned. Am I seeing things? Flying cars are appearing. Siaki, are you sure you&#x27;re not mistaken? It should be some kind of aircraft. I&#x27;ve looked at it repeatedly and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s talking about civilian flying cars.</p>
<p>Holy crap. This is outrageous. They actually managed to create a flying car without even realizing it. From initial skepticism to eventual excitement, in a short time, the entire Great Sea Kingdom was in an uproar. The announcement from the Great Sea Kingdom quickly dominated the trending topics on major social media platforms.</p>
<p>Chapter 132, the era of racing for All of Shiai Group. Chairman Zhao Jian Jun couldn&#x27;t stop smiling as he looked at the announcement released by the Shaman Academy of Sciences. Haha, luckily I held on back then. Otherwise, this time it would probably really be going to go bankrupt and be liquidated. It&#x27;s a pity that we only own 5% of the shares.</p>
<p>Zhao Jian felt a pang of regret. The board of directors of Shaman Auto was originally prepared to refuse to invest in Shingshin Flying Car. Despite opposition, he ultimately invested a sum of money in the name of Shachi Group. Otherwise, today he wasn&#x27;t laughing. He was crying but had nowhere to cry.</p>
<p>After the release of Starship racing, there&#x27;s no need to sell any passenger cars anymore. At least that&#x27;s the case in the great Sia Kingdom. As for overseas markets, it will definitely be the same in the future. At the same time, Dongfong Electric Group conference room, the CEO and senior executives gathered around the projection screen, their eyes filled with excitement. Haha, we&#x27;ve finally succeeded in developing it.</p>
<p>Starting today, Dongfong Electric Group is taking off. The boss was very excited. these three months. They shut down all car production lines and all employees were given unpaid leave. Moreover, they also offered various price reductions and promotions for exports.</p>
<p>The losses were quite severe, but it was all worth it. As long as the flying cars are mass-produced, they will have no trouble selling them. They have already begun transforming the original car production line, preparing to fully produce the starry sky flying car. Wait until the day Starship goes on sale. Their Dongfong Electric&#x27;s performance took off immediately.</p>
<p>As for the profit issue, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing to worry about. Sell the affordable version for 50,000 yuan to break even. But the deluxe and luxury versions are the most profitable, especially for subsequent exports. The price is directly increased more than 10 times. The profits will absolutely exceed your expectations.</p>
<p>In the great Sia Kingdom, every car company that invested in Starry Sky Racing was celebrating with champagne. And those smaller car companies, they could simply declare bankruptcy or switch to making two- wheeled electric vehicles. While the car companies in the great SEA Kingdom were celebrating international automakers present a completely different picture across the ocean, Ford Motor Company headquarters CEO Phelps frowned slightly as he looked at the announcement from the Academy of Sciences, a racing car launch event. What is the great SIA Kingdom planning now? He turned to the technical director beside him and asked, &quot;Tell me, has the Great Sea Kingdom really developed a flying car?&quot; The CTO frowned deeply. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to say.</p>
<p>Previously, all major car manufacturers in the Great Sea Kingdom chose to shut down all traditional automobile businesses. Who knows? They might actually develop it.&quot; If we consider the technological level of the former Great Sea Kingdom, he would state outright that it was impossible. But things are different now. The technology of the great SEA kingdom has seen an explosive increase. They can even travel to and from the moon with ease.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to delegate technology. After hearing the explanation, Phelps face darkened. If it&#x27;s true, then the entire automotive industry is going to be transformed. Let&#x27;s prepare in advance. The technical director nodded, his heart filled with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>He can only pray now that flying cars in the great Sea Kingdom are very expensive. It cannot be popularized among the general public. Only in this way can these car companies still have a way to survive. On the other side, European automakers also held an emergency online meeting. In the conference room, the heads of each car company looked extremely grim.</p>
<p>John Bull, BMW CEO, said in a deep voice, &quot;Everyone, let&#x27;s discuss how we should deal with the impact of the great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s flying cars on us. If flying cars really become widespread in the great Sea Kingdom, we will all suffer a devastating blow. I have a feeling they won&#x27;t be able to mass-produce it, said a Renault executive, frowning. Jaguar Land Rover in the Sunset Country reminded him. Have you forgotten about the mobile phone industry a few months ago? When it comes to the mobile phone industry, the entire meeting fell silent.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what the mobile phone manufacturers initially thought too. They felt that the great SEA kingdom was unable to mass-produce quantum chip mobile phones. And what was the result? Not only can it be mass-produced, it has already been sold all over the world. Utterly thrashed Pingua and Sanin. The US even wants them to resolve this through political means.</p>
<p>Import of mobile phones using quantum chips from the great Sia Kingdom is prohibited. But almost no countries responded. Only South Korea and the United States have banned its sale. Other countries have open markets. The key price is still 10 times the price within the great SEA Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is still in short supply. They initially thought it was just the mobile phone market. Unexpectedly, the automotive market is now next. The mobile phone industry serves as a cautionary tale. They must be prepared.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, the BMW co made a proposal. I suggest we discuss the export agency rights with the car manufacturers of the Great Sea Kingdom. We&#x27;ve set up a new company to partner with the great Sia Kingdom and take charge of their flying car sales in Europe. This is our only chance to survive. Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The worst offered Japanese automakers. The power outage had prevented their car manufacturers from producing vehicles. After this period of effort, they finally managed to solve the power problem. Production has just resumed. Then I saw the announcement released by the Seyaku Academy.</p>
<p>This made Japanese automakers feel like the sky was falling. It&#x27;s not just the land of cherry blossoms. South Korean automakers, automakers worldwide were thrown into a state of panic by a single announcement from the Shaman Academy of Sciences. The next day, 9:00 in the morning, the scene at the Starry Sky car launch event. Almost all the mainstream media outlets in the Great Sea Kingdom were present at the scene.</p>
<p>Moreover, all of them were broadcast live online. The number of viewers in each of the major live streaming rooms exceeded 1 million. The most frequent one is CCTV&#x27;s live broadcast room. The number of online users has exceeded 100 million. The scene of the press conference.</p>
<p>All media workers were filled with excitement. When does it start? What about the flying cars? Was it just a tech launch event? There were no actual products. I don&#x27;t understand. It should only appear at the beginning. If the price is below 200,000, I&#x27;ll grit my teeth and buy one.</p>
<p>Media workers looked at the empty stage and began to discuss it amongst themselves. At the same time, viewers in various live streaming rooms were also filled with anxiety. I&#x27;m so impatient. Why hasn&#x27;t it started yet? Where&#x27;s the flying car? I want to see the flying car. Let&#x27;s get started.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t wait. Well, I&#x27;m so excited. We&#x27;re about to enter the era of racing for everyone. Now, I&#x27;m just praying the price will be lower so I can save up to buy one. Yes, it would be best if they released one at an affordable price, just like mobile phones.</p>
<p>All the audience members were filled with anticipation. Anticipation for flying cars, expectations regarding price for this kind of cuttingedge technology product. They desperately wish they could release an affordable product like a mobile phone. Meanwhile, there were also many overseas nizens and people from foreign car companies in the live broadcast room. The flying car hadn&#x27;t appeared in their live stream footage yet.</p>
<p>Could it be that the great Sea Kingdom is putting up a smoke screen? Hopefully, it&#x27;s just a tech launch event. God bless. Overseas car companies were all praying silently. However, their prayers were doomed to disappointment because all the live broadcast cameras suddenly shifted to the air. Boom! Chapter 133.</p>
<p>Revolutionizing the automotive industry. Seven flying cars of different colors suddenly hovered 200 m in the air. The seven colors are like seven dazzling stars. It slowly descended from the sky above the press conference venue. the streamlined body and the futuristic metallic sheen.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so beautiful that you&#x27;ll want to stay forever. Even those present did not hear the roar of any engine. All that could be heard was a slight buzzing sound. The flying cars slowly descended. The eyes of reporters and media at the scene followed the movement.</p>
<p>It was as if they were frozen in place. Some reporters even froze, their microphones hovering over their mouths. Only your eyes can follow the moving car. I&#x27;m afraid of missing even a second. The flying car came to a smooth stop at the press conference venue.</p>
<p>The reporters and media outlets only then came to their senses. Their eyes were wide open, their mouth agape as if they were completely stunned. This is the legendary flying car. Even more beautiful than in science fiction movies. What have they done to me? Have I been transported into a sci-fi movie? All the reporters on site had a dreamlike feeling.</p>
<p>Some reporters rubbed their eyes repeatedly. Some people pinched their thighs hard. Some even slapped their companions. All of this was to confirm that what was happening before their eyes was real. In the live stream, the screen was instantly flooded with comments, densely covering the entire screen.</p>
<p>Holy Holy Holy My god. It really is a flying car. Great. Sia Kingdom is awesome. My mom asked me why I was kneeling to watch the live stream.</p>
<p>This is the reason. This design, this technological feel, I have to buy it. Yes, we&#x27;ll sell everything we own. will take out a loan to buy it. The number of viewers watching the CCTV live broadcast instantly exceeded 300 million.</p>
<p>The comment section was almost overflowing the screen and it&#x27;s still spreading like wildfire. In an instant, the number of viewers in all the live streaming rooms skyrocketed across the ocean Ford headquarters conference room. Phelps stared at the screen, his expression shifting from gloomy to deathly pale. No, impossible. How did they actually build a flying car? The technical director slumped in his chair, his eyes glazed over.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. The entire automotive industry is really about to change. Europe executives from BMW, Renault, and Jaguar Land Rover watched the seven flying cars on the screen. The conference room was deathly silent. The BMW co looked completely stunned, muttering to himself, &quot;We lost.</p>
<p>We both lost completely.&quot; A Renault executive said in a trembling voice, &quot;Yes, even if God came, he couldn&#x27;t save us. car companies. We must set up a new company as soon as possible and find a partner in the great SIA kingdom to handle the sales. The land of cherry blossoms, Toyota headquarters. The executives stared at the screen, their faces as white as sheets of paper.</p>
<p>The production line, which had just been restored, seemed to have instantly turned into scrap metal. Baka, our cars will never sell again. The scene of the press conference. The seven flying cars came to a steady stop on the ground. The hatch of a red flying car slowly opened.</p>
<p>A figure in red descended the stairs. Lee shouting, the general manager of Starry Sky Racing, looked dashing and confident in her red business attire. She glanced around the room, a slight smile playing on her lips. He walked up to the microphone and his voice was clear and powerful. Distinguished guests, dear audience members, welcome to the Starship launch event.</p>
<p>I am Lee shouting, the general manager of Star Sky Racing. Thunderous applause erupted instantly. Reporters frantically pressed the shutter and the flashes went off one after another in the live stream. Sister is so cool. That aura, I&#x27;m in love.</p>
<p>Hurry up and show me the specs. I can&#x27;t wait. Lee shouting raised her hand to signal for quiet and continued. Next, I will introduce the core parameters of Starship. First and foremost is speed.</p>
<p>Affordable version up to Mach 2, range of 3,000 km. Basic version up to Mach 3, range of 5,000 km. Advanced version up to Mach 4, range of 5,000 km. The luxury version can reach speeds up to Mach 5 and has a range of 6,000 km. The luxury version boasts a maximum speed of Mach 5 and a range of 8,000 km.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. A collective gasp filled the air. Minimum Mach 2. Is this defying the heavens? This isn&#x27;t a flying car. It&#x27;s a spaceship.</p>
<p>All journalists and media workers were stunned. This speed is faster than that of current fifth generation fighter jets. The live stream went absolutely wild. Holy chop. Holy chop.</p>
<p>These parameters are outrageous. What the hell? You call Mach 2 a flying car. And this cold sweat, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Even the base model has a range of 6,000 km and only needs to be charged once. Even more impressive than the US&#x27;s fighter jets.</p>
<p>just one speed parameter. It already shocked and stunned everyone. Dumbf found it after hearing the speed parameters of the starry sky car. They couldn&#x27;t react at all. Ford&#x27;s chief technical officer, impossible.</p>
<p>How could they achieve such terrifying speeds? How could they solve the problem of human acceleration overload? BMW&#x27;s technical director. This is absolutely fake. How could a civilian flying car achieve this speed? It must be insane. Toyota&#x27;s chief technical officer, Baka. The Great Sea Kingdom is definitely faking the specifications.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re trying to deceive the whole world. Modern technology director. Damn it. Does the great Sea Kingdom think that just increasing speed is enough? Can ordinary people withstand overload? They still clung to a last shred of hope. Hopefully, this is just a laboratory product from the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>It will not be used commercially. Only in this way can they have a chance to survive. However, they soon despared. The scene of the press conference. Lee shouting continued her introduction without pausing.</p>
<p>Regarding charging, all versions support fast charging. Fully charged in 5 minutes. Takeoff and landing method. Vertical takeoff and landing. No runway required.</p>
<p>You can park in the parking lot at home or in the open space of the community. In addition, all models come standard with fully autonomous driving and 3D visual radar. Safety performance meets military standards. She paused for a moment, then continued. Oh, by the way, the cockpits of our starship are specially designed so that even if they accelerate to Mach 5 instantly, they will not cause any harm to the human body.</p>
<p>Next, please enjoy the flight demonstration. After saying that, she waved her hand gently. The seven flying cars suddenly started moving. They slowly ascended into the air, then nimbly weaved through the air, performing a variety of difficult maneuvers. Accelerate, turn, hover.</p>
<p>The movements were smooth without any lag. Reporters and media at the scene were stunned. The viewers in the live stream were thoroughly entertained. The handling is amazing. Fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>No more driving tests needed. I feel safe and secure. Buy it. We absolutely have to buy it. W I hope the price can be more affordable.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve really fallen in love with this racing car. Some people were initially worried about safety and flight issues. After listening and watching, I felt completely relieved. Many people wish they could push their cars into the ditch immediately. Compared to Starship Troopers, the car they have is garbage.</p>
<p>Even a second longer than that would make them feel extremely uncomfortable. Now, all they can do is pray that the prices will be more affordable. If the basic model costs around 200,000, many people will grit their teeth and find a way to buy it. At the same time, foreign car manufacturers are in utter despair. They initially harbored a Xiao Xing Shin lead, a sense of wishful thinking.</p>
<p>They believed that the flying cars of the Great Sea Kingdom could not solve the problem of acceleration overload. As a result, the Great Sea Kingdom had thought everything through. Now he can only pray that the price isn&#x27;t too cheap. Such an advanced flying car. It must start at least at 10 million.</p>
<p>In this way, their automotive industry might still have a chance to survive. Otherwise, they would all go bankrupt. Chapter 134. Price killer. Car companies explode amidst the spotlight.</p>
<p>After a brief performance, the stunt cars back to where we started. Only then diddly shouting continued speaking. Next, we will reveal the price that everyone is most concerned about. The words had barely left his mouth. The scene fell silent instantly.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breath, staring at Lee, shouting. The chat in the live stream also stopped. Many people were praying frantically in their hearts. There must be one that costs 200,000. May all the gods and Buddhas and may Guanin Bodhis Sutva protect us.</p>
<p>Some people have worshiped almost every god and Buddha they can think of. Even worshiped the demon god. Even the executives of those foreign car companies were on tenor hooks. Price is their last hope. Amidst everyone&#x27;s anticipation, Lee shouting smiled slightly and spoke clearly.</p>
<p>The price of our starship is the luxury version costs 1.5 million yuan. This price was announced. The reporters and media present were somewhat disappointed. 1.5 million. I can&#x27;t afford it.</p>
<p>Sigh. It&#x27;s still a bit expensive. They seem too eager. Only hearing about the price later. At this moment, someone reminded me a rich man version.</p>
<p>Does that mean there are other versions as well? Upon hearing this, those around them instantly felt hopeful to the live stream at this time. When I first heard the price of 1.5 million, most viewers were instantly disappointed, but they quickly realized what was happening. On the contrary, foreign car companies are in utter despair. The price of 10 million that they wanted did not materialize. On the contrary, it&#x27;s almost 10 times cheaper.</p>
<p>However, the price that Lee Shouting then announced caused those foreign car companies to explode instantly. Lee Shouting directly announced all subsequent prices. The more affordable version is 50,000 yuan. Basic version 110,000 yuan. Advanced version 250,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The deluxe version costs 500,000 yuan. And it will be displayed on the screen. Boom. The scene instantly erupted in chaos. The reporters jumped up and cheered wildly.</p>
<p>Wow, the affordable version is only 50,000. Am I dreaming? Someone wake me up. The era of racing for everyone has truly arrived. In the live stream, the viewers comments were already incoherent. What the hell? Can someone wake me up and see if I&#x27;m dreaming? A more affordable version only 50,000.</p>
<p>Are you sure it&#x27;s not just missing a zero? If the price is true, I definitely want to buy one. W the country is really caring about us ordinary people now. I&#x27;m so happy. Who wouldn&#x27;t be excited at this price? Most ordinary families can afford it if they grit their teeth and spend a little more. 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Although there are many, but you can buy a flying car. Life will definitely see a qualitative improvement, especially those who work away from home year round. After purchasing the flying car, you can go home to visit more often. No more worrying about children and elderly people being left unattended. All over Dasha Kingdom on the streets and alleys, people are gathered around their mobile phones and televisions.</p>
<p>The moment they saw the price, they all cheered. Great, 50,000. I can afford it, too. I won&#x27;t have to squeeze onto the subway to get to work anymore. It only takes a few minutes to get from my hometown to the city.</p>
<p>Some people even set off firecrackers to celebrate this historic moment. A price exceeding 200,000 is likely unaffordable for many families, but the price is 50,000. Even if I can&#x27;t afford it, I won&#x27;t complain. I can only blame myself for not working hard enough. At the same time, headquarters of foreign car companies, Ford CEO Michael Phelps suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>His face was deathly pale and his hands were trembling. 50,000 5000 yuan. How dare they set such a low price? What do they want to do? The technical director muttered. It&#x27;s over. May the entire automotive industry be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Europe. BMW co slumped in his chair, his eyes filled with despair. 50,000. Even at cost price, we can&#x27;t do it. The great Sia Kingdom is trying to completely destroy us.</p>
<p>It seems that the only way forward is to find a distributor in the great SIA kingdom. At this point, they had given up all hope. Only by acting as a reseller can they survive. Toyota headquarters in Japan. The executives looked at each other, their eyes filled with despair.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. We can just go bankrupt right now of South Korea. Someone in the meeting room burst into tears. It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s all over.</p>
<p>Our market is completely gone. The scene of the press conference. Lee shouting continued. Starship Racer is now open for pre-orders. Official delivery will take place one month later.</p>
<p>In addition, we will build charging base stations across the country to ensure that every car owner can conveniently charge their vehicle. At the same time, we welcome cooperation from overseas distributors. The scene of the press conference. The cheers grew louder and louder. Lee shouting raised her hand to indicate that she was speaking and continued.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s another piece of good news. Starry Sky Racer supports personalized customization. Color, interior design, and functions can all be adjusted according to needs. In addition, we will be launching a public flying car version. In the future, public transportation and passenger transport across the country will be replaced by flying cars to allow everyone to enjoy the convenience brought by flying cars.</p>
<p>As she spoke, Lee Shouting mentioned another car purchase policy. According to national requirements, married families with children will be given priority in vehicle delivery. At the same time, the more children a family has, the faster the car delivery speed will be. From now on, newlyweds can also enjoy priority car delivery policy. You can also enjoy interest-free loans with no handling fees.</p>
<p>These policies were introduced. Everyone was completely stunned. Holy crap. Is this a public pressure to get married? W I&#x27;m still single, but I want to buy a car. It seems we must get married as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding these policies, many people have their own little complaints, but the thought of being able to deliver the flying car ahead of schedule was a relief. Single people are starting to prepare to find someone to date and get married. Meanwhile, families with many children began to get excited. At this moment, they finally felt the care and concern that the country had shown them. The ordinary people of the entire Great Sea Kingdom were subtly changed because of the Star Chariot.</p>
<p>Many people are thinking about how to meet the priority delivery criteria. Foreign automakers have begun to take action. They chartered a private plane directly to the Great Sa Kingdom. They wanted to acquire the overseas sales rights for the great sea kingdom. It&#x27;s not just car companies.</p>
<p>Even many bigname investors flocked to the great sea kingdom, especially in desert-rich countries. The moment they saw the flying car, they flew directly to the great Sia Kingdom. They would buy it no matter how much it cost. Siaki Lin Shun watched the live stream with a smile on his lips. Lie Jian Guo patted Lin Shun on the shoulder and said excitedly, &quot;Kobayashi, you did it.</p>
<p>The era of racing for everyone has begun. Lynchan nodded, his eyes resolute. This is just the beginning. Next, we need to accelerate the construction of the lunar base. There&#x27;s also controlled nuclear fusion, which will soon undergo its first ignition.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo exclaimed excitedly. Really? That&#x27;s wonderful. Lynchin proposed oldly. I suggest we take this opportunity to announce those livelihood policies and start encouraging child birth. Lie Jian Guo nodded.</p>
<p>Good. Now is indeed a good opportunity. Now is the time when everyone is enthusiastic about racing games. A series of policies aimed at improving people&#x27;s livelihoods were announced, including measures to encourage marriage and childirth. The general public will definitely find it easier to accept.</p>
<p>Chapter 135 crazy agency rights, earning a staggering 2.5 trillion. The press conference has ended. It will explode across the globe like a nuclear bomb. On the international internet, Twitter headlines are filled with Starship Trooper content. The comments section was filled with expressions of amazement and envy.</p>
<p>Oh my god, why isn&#x27;t such an advanced flying car hours? My god, has the great Sea Kingdom been controlled by an alien civilization? How come there are so many advanced technological products? Aren&#x27;t flying cars just something that appears in American science fiction movies? Why is it that China can actually build them? If I have the chance, I will definitely buy one. the entire international network. Everyone praised Starship. Almost everyone felt that this was a groundbreaking product. It is a product that should not exist in this era, but they all wanted to have it.</p>
<p>Many wealthy people waved their banknotes and searched everywhere for purchasing channels. At the same time, the White House of the US often looked at the content of the Starship Motors press conference and felt completely distraught. Can a flying car reach a top speed of Mach 5 and it&#x27;s so cheap? Is this an attempt to destroy the entire automotive industry? With the release of this flying car by the great sea kingdom, their sixth generation fighter jets are a joke. If any country buys this vehicle and adds a weapon system, isn&#x27;t it just a fighter jet? It is foreseeable. The global automotive market will certainly suffer a devastating blow in the future.</p>
<p>Just then, Secretary of State Raymond entered the office in a panic and hurriedly said, &quot;Mr. President, the major automakers have gone crazy. Executives from Ford and GM are chartering private jets to Great Sea. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, Gulfream, and Martin are also flying to Great Sea. Upon hearing this, Optton&#x27;s face instantly darkened.</p>
<p>Why didn&#x27;t you stop them? Lay Ming Duo smiled bitterly. We couldn&#x27;t stop them. They said this was their only way to survive. OP and the others remained silent. Those capitalists were indeed right.</p>
<p>The great Sia Kingdom star chariot is destined to sweep the globe. It will definitely revolutionize the global automotive market. Even the commercial aviation market will be destroyed. It was perfectly reasonable for them to go to the great SIA kingdom at this time. However, as long as the US doesn&#x27;t open up imports, their domestic car and airplane markets remain their own.</p>
<p>At the very least, local businesses can survive. However, ordinary American citizens will forever remain inferior. Thinking of this optin ordered raando go and issue a notice banning the import of great sia flying cars into our country Mr. president wouldn&#x27;t this laying duo tried to persuade him but optin interrupted him directly you don&#x27;t need to worry about anything else just go and issue the announcement all right laying duo had no choice but to issue an announcement once the announcement was released the entire United States was in an uproar has opting gone mad why would he ban the import of flying cars from great sa I wanted to buy a flying car but it&#x27;s banned from sale incompetent government what ride do you have to stop us from enjoying the freedom of high technology. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>The sanctions must be lifted. Large numbers of American citizens took to the streets to protest with banners. They also want to enjoy high-tech products. They don&#x27;t want to be inferior to others. They want freedom.</p>
<p>On the other side, international capital is pouring into the great Sia Kingdom. There are simply too many people who want overseas agency rights. Ultimately, an auction was held. 3 days later, the auction for the Starry Sky Racing Agency rights was held at the Beijing International Convention and Exhibition Center. The venue was filled with global automotive industry leaders and financial giants.</p>
<p>Lee Shouting walked onto the stage, microphone in hand, with a confident smile. Ladies and gentlemen, the international agency rights for Starchaser are divided into five regions with a starting bid of 10 billion great SIA coins. Let&#x27;s start with the European region. As soon as he finished speaking, signs were immediately raised from the audience. I&#x27;ll offer 50 billion for the European region.</p>
<p>The European Automotive Alliance was the first to raise his paddle. They directly increase the price by five times. The goal is to scare away other investors, let alone 50 billion. They would bid for it even if it were 500 billion. Otherwise, they will only face certain death.</p>
<p>The gray market suddenly quieted down. 60 billion. Suddenly, a voice rang out. It was the representative of the desert rich nation of Sartra who shouted it. He was wearing a long golden robe holding a sign in his hand and looked relaxed.</p>
<p>With one person taking the lead, other major investors followed suit and began to raise their stakes. 65 billion, 70 billion, 200 billion. The representative of the European Automobile Federation shouted out 200 billion. Instantly, the entire venue gasped. Are you crazy? Buying agency rights for 200 billion.</p>
<p>This is a dealership fee, not money for the car. The European Automobile Union representative, however, was unconcerned. We must secure the European distribution rights. Seeing the European Automobile Federation so arrogant, Sarter&#x27;s representative continued to shout, &quot;300 billion. We don&#x27;t have much of anything.</p>
<p>We have plenty of money.&quot; The European Automobile Union representative, unable to refute the argument, could only sulk and continue bidding, 310 billion. Other big players then joined in the bidding. The deal finally stopped when the European Automobile Federation demanded 500 billion. After waiting a moment and seeing that no one else was bidding, Lee shouting made the final decision. Congratulations to the representative of the European Automobile Federation for securing the European dealership rights.</p>
<p>Then the agency rights for the black state and desert regions were acquired by a group of desert tycoons. The agency rights for the Americas were acquired by a consortium of financial giants. The price is 500 billion yuan. Finally, the Asian agency rights were acquired by a consortium of capital from the great SEA kingdom. Also 500 billion.</p>
<p>The agency rights alone have yielded 2.5 trillion. The auction has ended. Contract signing. The cost price for export is 10 times that of the current market price. The specific quantity they sell is determined by their distributors.</p>
<p>All the agents felt there was no problem with this. They firmly believe that the agency fees spent today are worthwhile. In the end, you&#x27;ll definitely earn even more. After the auction ended from the desert, Rich Country went directly to Lee Shouting. Mr.</p>
<p>Lee, we want to customize 5,000 luxury version flying cars. Name your price. Lee shouting was stunned for a moment. The customized version for the tycoon costs 100 million each. So 5,000 of them would be 500 billion.</p>
<p>Are you sure? Representative Sartra nodded with a smile. Confirmed. We can transfer the money now. Lee shouting was a little excited inside, but she pretended to be calm on the surface. She immediately arranged for someone to prepare the contract.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, we will definitely meet your customization requirements. Lee Shouting was overjoyed. This isn&#x27;t buying a car. It&#x27;s practically giving away money. Today&#x27;s auction of agency rights has already deeply shocked her.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled by her calm demeanor. Actually, the whole auction just now, she felt like she was in a dream. When she first set the agency fee at 10 billion yuan, she felt it was too much. If it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the head office, Shiningshin Technology, said it was the price set by the Shaman Academy of Sciences. She wouldn&#x27;t dare set the price that high.</p>
<p>But who could have imagined that it would eventually fetch a staggering 500 billion? That&#x27;s outrageous. trillion just by acquiring five agency rights. Moreover, the export price is 10 times the domestic selling price. The profits involved are terrifying. Just thinking about it is exciting.</p>
<p>Now, another tycoon is ordering a custommade flying car. Another order worth 500 billion. This money comes faster than the bank prints money. After seeing off the delegation of wealthy desert merchants, Lee Shouting then reported on the situation of today&#x27;s auction. At the same time, pre-orders for Starship Racer have begun in China.</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m., the pre-sale channel opened on time. Thanks to the use of quantum chips, the server can accommodate billions of people making online reservations simultaneously. There&#x27;s absolutely no need to worry about the system crashing. 10 minutes later, Star Racer official data released. Pre-orders have exceeded 50 million.</p>
<p>This number shocked everyone. Chapter 136, Starry Sky car sells out. The internet has gone completely crazy. Wow. I locked in my order in 3 seconds and I&#x27;m already ranked 5 millionth.</p>
<p>How long have you guys been single? I&#x27;m even faster. I lock in the order in just 2 seconds and I&#x27;m already ranked 1 millionth. This is insane. 50 million yuan in pre-sales orders in just 10 minutes. Is this selling cars or giving them away? Aren&#x27;t people saying everyone&#x27;s having a hard time? Why are so many people buying? Damn, they sold 50 million in just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>How long will the queue take? At the same time, in a certain village, I heard the pre-sale data on the radio. The villagers were stunned and dumbfounded. 50 million vehicles. How much does this cost? Haha, I bought one, too. It&#x27;ll be much more convenient to go to the market now.</p>
<p>I hope the car can be delivered soon. That way, it will be more convenient for me to visit my daughter and son in the future. Yes, with Starship, the kids at home can come back to see us more often. The farmers were overjoyed. They are full of anticipation for Starship.</p>
<p>Many children work away from home and only come back once or twice a year because of their jobs. They also long for their child to be by their side, but it&#x27;s for survival. This separation is the only thing we can endure. With the new flying car, this situation can be completely changed. They might not be able to afford other versions of the flying car, but the more affordable version costs 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>They can still buy it if they grit their teeth. In the past, it would take half a day just to travel by car to the county town to go to the market. Once the flying car arrives, it will only take a few minutes. No more worries about traffic jams or car accidents. Moreover, Starship Racer has introduced new regulations this time.</p>
<p>All vehicles purchased are for personal or family use only. If you want to resell it, it can only be recycled by Starship. At the same time, each vehicle is linked to the individual&#x27;s ID card when it is purchased. No one else could steal it. This also helps to effectively eliminate scalpers.</p>
<p>Any scalper who purchases the item can only use it themselves. Aside from those who have money on hand and place an order directly, those who had no money were also trying to find a solution. Almost the entire Great Sia Kingdom was discussing Star Chariot. On the international internet, the art style is completely different. Has the Great Sia Kingdom gone mad? 50 million orders in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>When did they become so rich? I envy the people of Dashia. They can experience groundbreaking high-tech products for just 50,000 yuan. Is there anyone in the great Sea Kingdom who needs a wife? I want to marry into the Great Sea Kingdom. That&#x27;s right. I don&#x27;t want a dowy and I&#x27;m not going to cause trouble.</p>
<p>I just want to marry a man from the Great Sea Kingdom. The appearance of Starship. This has led many single women abroad to start eyeing single men from the great SEA Kingdom. They already knew that there were tens of millions more single men than single women in the great sea kingdom. This is their best chance to become citizens of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Many single, high- achieving women have begun to inquire about the details of transnational marriage. They even started learning Chinese. She hopes to marry into the great SEA Kingdom in the future. At the same time, the entire Blueest Star world have completely given up hope after they learned that the agency rights had been auctioned off for an astronomical price. I knew the traditional automotive industry was doomed to die.</p>
<p>Those capitalists spent so much money to acquire the agency rights. They will definitely promote it extensively in their respective areas of responsibility. Even if their country wanted to ban it, they couldn&#x27;t because when those capitals unite, even a nation has to be cautious. The shock of the high-speed car chase hasn&#x27;t subsided yet. The Great Sea Kingdom has once again announced a world shaking policy on people&#x27;s livelihood.</p>
<p>Starting today, a one-time reward of 50,000 yuan will be given for each child born. In addition, a child support subsidy of 10,000 yuan will be provided annually until the child turns 18. All school fees for children are waved. There are no charges whatsoever for schooling. All medical expenses are waved and fully reimbursed by the government.</p>
<p>Collecting betroal gifts under any pretext is prohibited. Violators will have all benefits for the entire household revoked. Newlyweds can be offered free accommodation. talent recruitment program recruiting top industry talent globally with benefits and compensation. The news came out.</p>
<p>The people of the great Sia Kingdom were in an uproar. Is this true? A 50,000 yuan bonus for having a baby and all the child&#x27;s education expenses are waved. Plus, you get a salary. Wow. Married couples and newlyweds get priority for Starship Roller Coaster.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this tempting us to get married as soon as possible? Free medical care. Is this defying the heavens? Cancer patient X Shaoli Wa. Is it true that medical care is completely free? Will it be free even for cancer patients? It&#x27;s true. I just asked the mayor and it will be implemented starting today. Huh, that&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>This is a truly beneficial policy for the people. For a time, discussions about new policies to improve people&#x27;s livelihoods completely overshadowed Starship. If you ask what ordinary people care about most, it&#x27;s nothing more than food, clothing, housing, and transportation. As long as there is food to eat and a place to stay when sick, the old folks will live. That&#x27;s more important than anything else.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the new policy directly reduces the cost of raising children to almost zero. They no longer need to worry about their children&#x27;s education, medical care, and upbringing. Many women who originally only wanted one child did not want a second one. Many are starting to prepare for a second child. Meanwhile, those who are single are starting to look for their other half and prepare for marriage.</p>
<p>This not only solved the problem of bride price, but also the housing problem. Crucially, it also allows you to prioritize starship. All three major obstacles to marriage have been eliminated. They had absolutely no concerns. At the same time, internationally, the great SIA kingdom&#x27;s talent recruitment plan has caused a complete uproar.</p>
<p>The international top talent community is in complete uproar. NASA Labs in the United States. Professor Chun, a Chinese American scientist, became thoroughly excited when he saw the talent recruitment plan of the great Sia Kingdom. Huh, finally, I see hope of going back. Professor, should we apply? Professor Chin exclaimed excitedly, &quot;Apply immediately and try to leave the US today.&quot; He knew it perfectly well.</p>
<p>The US government will definitely take counter measures after seeing this policy of the great Sia Kingdom. It&#x27;s too late. It&#x27;ll probably be difficult for them to leave the US now. CERN, European Organization for Nuclear Research. Several scientists were arguing around a cell phone.</p>
<p>The technological strength of the Great Sea Kingdom is far superior to ours. My son will be starting primary school next year, and their educational green channel will come in handy. Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s sign up together. The most talented people on the entire planet were all tempted.</p>
<p>They started making calls to inquire about talent immigration. Some are happy, some are sad. When countries around the world saw the great SIA kingdoms talent recruitment plan, they were completely panicked. The White House of the US opted looked at the talent recruitment plan and was shocked. they&#x27;re trying to poach our players.</p>
<p>Lay Ming Duo rushed in flustered. President, I just received news that NASA has 12 top scientists who have submitted applications to recruit talent to the great Sia Kingdom. Optin stood up abruptly, his chest heaving. Stop them. Even if you revoke their visas, you can&#x27;tt let them go to Great Sea.</p>
<p>Lay Ming Duo smiled bitterly. It&#x27;s too late. They&#x27;ve already boarded a flight to the Great Sia Kingdom. Pulled roared. Send fighter jets to shoot down this flight immediately.</p>
<p>Chapter 137 cancer cure. Looking into Optin&#x27;s bloodshot eyes, Raando&#x27;s heart pounded, and she hurriedly tried to persuade him. President, are you insane? That&#x27;s a civilian flight. There are American citizens on board. Opton completely ignored this and continued to do as he pleased.</p>
<p>So what if you&#x27;re a citizen? A bunch of traitors. They deserve to die. As long as we can keep those traitors, what&#x27;s the harm in sacrificing a few ordinary people? Lay Ming Duo grew even more anxious. Cold sweat beating on his forehead, his voice trembling yet unusually firm. Have you forgotten what happened to the land of cherry blossoms? They were bombed so badly by the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>And then what happened? He&#x27;s been sitting in the corner all this time, too afraid to say a word. They are still living in the dark ages. Japan&#x27;s economy has regressed by 80 years. The streets are full of refugees begging. Laying&#x27;s voice grew louder and louder.</p>
<p>Every word struck Upton&#x27;s heart like a hammer blow. Upton&#x27;s body stiffened abruptly. State of Japan instantly flooded my mind. Those burned buildings, those desperate cries, the thought of the consequences of a power outage sent chills down his spine. The anger in his chest seemed to be extinguished by ice water, and his breathing gradually became steady.</p>
<p>His eyes regained some clarity. You mean, does the great Sa Kingdom really dare to attack us? Laying nodded vigorously. They dare to declare exclusive ownership of the moon. What else wouldn&#x27;t they dare to do? Their talent recruitment plan is now aimed at attracting top talent from around the world. If we provoke them again, she dared not continue speaking.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Optton slumped into his chair, supporting his forehead with his hands. A moment later, he suddenly looked up and made a new decision. Immediately release a talent retention plan. Researcher salaries will increase 10fold. Free housing, all taxes waved.</p>
<p>Besides, add back all the research funding that was slated for cut. Laying breathed a sigh of relief and nodded quickly. Yes, I&#x27;ll take care of it right away. At the same time, presidential palaces around the world, almost the same scene was playing out. Prime Minister John Bull looked at the talent recruitment report on the table with a serious expression.</p>
<p>Immediately improve the compensation and benefits for scientific researchers. We absolutely cannot let the great SIA kingdom poach our talent. The French president roared into the phone. Give all scientists a raise. We also need to provide them with bodyguards.</p>
<p>24-hour protection. In a short time, a global talent war has begun. Only the land of cherry blossoms. Jiro Kishida sat in his dimly lit office, looking at the report in my hand. A cold smile curled at the corner of his lips.</p>
<p>Trying to poach our talent. No way. He picked up the pen and signed his name on the document. No citizen is allowed to leave the country. Anyone who violates this rule will be executed.</p>
<p>The secretary looked at the document, her face turning pale. Your excellency, wouldn&#x27;t this be? Jiro Kishida slammed his hand on the table. Shut up. The great Sia Kingdom has destroyed everything we have. Even if our talent rots in the country, we can&#x27;t let them benefit from it.</p>
<p>Thinking of how badly the Great Sia Kingdom had harmed them. How could we possibly allow talented people to flow to the Great Sa Kingdom? In fact, his worries were completely unnecessary. Even if some Japanese soldiers wanted to go to the Great Sea Kingdom, the Great Sa Kingdom certainly wouldn&#x27;t want it either. The secretary dared not speak again. He could only take the documents and hurriedly leave.</p>
<p>No matter how crazy the world is. The great Sia Kingdom, Sia Academy of Sciences. Lynchin looked at the reports on the table. A satisfied smile appeared on his lips. Starry Sky Racing pre-sales exceeded 50 million.</p>
<p>Top talents from around the world are applying for immigration. Everything is moving in a positive direction. Oldly Lynchin looked up at Li Jian Guo. The effects of the policies that benefit people&#x27;s livelihoods are very obvious. Next, it&#x27;s time to solve the next problem.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo put down his teacup, a look of anticipation in his eyes. What are your thoughts now? Lynchian nodded. Medical related questions. Lie Jian Guo was taken aback then overjoyed. You mean? Lynch nodded.</p>
<p>With the new policies, without a strong medical system, the entire medical system will collapse. Therefore, there must be medical methods to quickly treat various terminal illnesses. In a few days, I will provide a solution that can cure all kinds of terminal illnesses. Lie Jian Guo was shocked. Really? Lynch nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>Then, Lynshan explained briefly before going back to prepare. Nightfell. Lyn Shun arrived at the Heritage Space Laboratory as usual to carry out the final step of assembly for controlled nuclear fusion. After the final assembly step is completed, the familiar notifications sounded in his mind again. Ding! Successful transfer of controlled nuclear fusion technology, unlocking the legacy of new technologies.</p>
<p>Please select complete lunarbased technology/cancer cure/artificial intelligence. Lynn Shenzai lit up. The complete technology for a lunar base is tempting, but now people&#x27;s livelihood issues are more important. He did not hesitate at all. Choose a cancer specific drug.</p>
<p>Ding! Selection successful. The formula for a highly effective cancer drug has been transmitted. A flood of information rushed into Lin Chen&#x27;s mind. The entire technology behind the cancer specific drug came to mind. The body has been subtly transformed by the space over this period of time.</p>
<p>Now he receives the inheritance for shorter and shorter periods of time. Once the cancer specific drug is completed, there will be ample time to select the complete technology for a lunar base. After all, controlled nuclear fusion has not yet been achieved in reality. This is a good time to take advantage of the opportunity. Solve domestic medical problems.</p>
<p>Lynshin quickly organized all the information about cancer specific drugs in his mind. This product uses a super fagicite to engulf all viral cells in the human body and then eliminate all cancer cells. This special medicine except for the inability to regenerate severed limbs. All symptoms can be treated now. Whether it&#x27;s a terminal illness or a common cold or fever, both can be easily treated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cost is very low. It will completely overturn the current medical system. It is foreseeable that once a cancer specific drug is developed, the entire planet Earth will go crazy for it. Good. With this effective drug, the new policy can be effectively resolved.</p>
<p>Lynch was very satisfied with this special medicine. Then immediately head to the Heritage Space Laboratory to begin hands-on experiments. He wants to optimize the current biomedical technology in the great sea kingdom so that it can be successfully mass-produced. Lynching got busy in the laboratory. Although this was my first time encountering biological science, but he wasn&#x27;t rusty at all.</p>
<p>All I felt was excitement. In the Heritage Space Laboratory, various sophisticated instruments operate with ease in his hands. He carefully adjusted each parameter, observing the changes of super fagosites under special conditions. Every small adjustment can affect the final effectiveness of the drug. After countless trials and improvements, Lynchin finally found the best formula and production process.</p>
<p>He looked at the active super fagasites in the petri dish and a relieved smile appeared on his face. Next, we need to write out the actual plan. And then finally, Gian chapter 130 ate the shock of biologists. Two days later, Lynshin finished typing the last set of experimental reports on the computer, his eyes filled with excitement. In the past two days, during the day, he writes technical proposals for effective cancer drugs.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to the heritage space to optimize the relevant process parameters. Everything is done in order to minimize costs. It can enable the great SEA kingdom to provide free health care to all citizens at the lowest possible cost. This will improve the happiness index of ordinary people in the great sea kingdom. Great, it&#x27;s finally finished.</p>
<p>Next, we need to discuss the project approval with elderly. With that, he picked up his computer and went to find Li Jian Guo, office of the dean of the Academy of Sciences. Lie Jian Guo was checking the progress of the controlled nuclear fusion project. Upon hearing the knock, he casually replied, &quot;Come in.&quot; The door opened and Lynshin walked in carrying a laptop. Mr.</p>
<p>lying Lynch&#x27;s voice, Lie Jian Guo looked up and smiled. Little Lynn, you&#x27;re here. Then, upon seeing the computer in Linshins hand, he immediately became excited. Shaolin, do you have another new project? Lynshan smiled and nodded. Oldly, I can&#x27;t hide it from you after all.</p>
<p>This is a technical solution for a highly effective cancer drug. Take a look. As he spoke, he handed over the computer. A cure for cancer? Li Jian Guo was taken aback then excitedly took the computer and began to examine it. He looked at the eye-catching title on the first page.</p>
<p>Cancer specific drug super fagosidic cell culture technology solution. This is the title alone was enough to shock Liang Guo. The name super fagasite alone tells you it&#x27;s something extraordinary. Keep reading. Lie Jian Guo started performing Sichuan opera face changing again.</p>
<p>With each page he read the shock on his face grew. Every piece of data inside is incredibly accurate and every process is intricately linked. The further he turned the pages, the more shocked he became, even if he is not an expert in biological sciences. This also shows that this technical solution is extraordinary. The final summary in particular made him so excited that he stood up from his chair.</p>
<p>Xialan, are you really saying you can cure all cancers 100%. Lie Jang Wos voice trembled, his eyes fixed on Lin Shan as if confirming something. Linshin nodded emphatically, his tone calm. Yes, besides cancer, it can also treat common viral infections and bacterial inflammations. Lie Jian Guo was instantly overjoyed.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s great. That&#x27;s great. He was at a loss for words to praise Lynch. With this technology, implementing free healthcare in the country will become incredibly easy. It&#x27;s important to know that every year many people suffer and die from cancer.</p>
<p>This also places a heavy burden on their families. In ordinary families, a cancer diagnosis can plunge a family into complete poverty. They might even incur huge debts resulting in losing both their money and their loved ones. If there were a cancer specific drug like Lynch, those tragedies may never happen again. After the initial excitement, Lie Jian Guo couldn&#x27;t wait even a minute longer.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, you wait. I will convene a meeting of experts and missians in the field of bioscience right now and approved the project immediately. Lynchin nodded slightly. Then I watched as Lie Jian Guo started busily making various phone calls. Not long after the notification from the Sea Academy of Sciences was like a bomb exploding in the biomedical community of the great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Urgent notice. Allademicians and experts in the biomedical field are requested to arrive at the conference room in the main building of the Shaman Academy of Sciences tomorrow morning. Absence is not permitted. College of Life Sciences, Kyoto University. Academician Jang was teaching a class when he received a call from his assistant.</p>
<p>He frowned slightly. Siaki Yuan called an emergency meeting. Did he say what it was about? It wasn&#x27;t said, but you are required to attend the meeting. Academician Jean frowned but still agreed. Okay, I understand.</p>
<p>Then he let the students review on their own. He then rushed to the Xiaku Academy. Such situations occur throughout the entire Great Sa Kingdom. Many experts were completely bewildered when they received the meeting notice. But in the end, they chose to rush to the Seyaku Academy as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The next day, the entrance to the conference room in the main building of the Seyaku Academy. A huge crowd gathered. They are all top figures in the biomedical field of the great sea kingdom. Academician Jang pulled Professor Wong aside and whispered, &quot;Old Wong, do you know what&#x27;s going on?&quot; Professor Wong shook his head, looking bewildered. &quot;I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>I just rushed over from the lab last night.&quot; &quot;Me, too.&quot; Academician Lu interjected from the side when I received the notification. I was performing gene sequencing on a patient. &quot;What exactly happened? Could it be a major epidemic? That&#x27;s not right. If it&#x27;s an outbreak, we should notify the CDC. Discussions rose and fell.</p>
<p>Everyone&#x27;s face was filled with doubt. They are all authorities in their respective fields. We usually discuss the agenda in advance for meetings. So, this is the first time we&#x27;ve had a surprise attack like this. 9:00 sharp.</p>
<p>The conference room door opened. Staff members came out carrying a stack of documents and distributed them to everyone. Please sign this confidentiality agreement. It is classified as top secret. Entry to the venue is only permitted after signing the agreement.</p>
<p>When academician Jeang picked up the document and saw the two large red characters top secret, his pupils suddenly contracted. He has been engaged in scientific research for decades and has only seen this level of confidentiality agreement when researching national strategic projects. What what exactly is this project? Professor Lee standing nearby was also stunned. He gripped the document tightly, hesitating to write. Top secret? Could it involve biological weapons? Impossible.</p>
<p>Professor Wong shook his head. Sia Academy of Sciences has always opposed biological weapons research. The discussion grew louder. Some hesitated while others were curious, but no one dared to refuse. After all, what could warrant such a large-scale mobilization from the Sia Academy of Sciences must be no small matter.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, everyone signed the agreement and went into the conference room. While everyone was wondering, Lie Jian Guo led Lin Shun into the conference room. The experts were even more bewildered by this scene. Why is Dean Lee chairing the meeting? Who is the person next to him? Because it is cross-disciplinary. In addition, Lynchin&#x27;s identity has always been kept secret.</p>
<p>Apart from members of the relevant project team and a few highle executives, Lynchin&#x27;s identity was not known. No one else had the chance to learn Lin Chin&#x27;s identity. Academician Jeang couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Dean Lee, what exactly is this project? We have absolutely no idea what it is.&quot; Lie Jian Guo smiled and introduced, &quot;Today&#x27;s meeting topic was proposed by Comrade Lynch, who will now explain it to you.&quot; Lynchin picked up the microphone, his voice clear and strong. I&#x27;ve invited everyone here today for a project, a cancer treatment drug, a cure for cancer. The audience erupted in cheers.</p>
<p>Cancer is a global challenge. Many countries have been researching it for decades without making a breakthrough. What are you a young man know? Deanley, are you joking? Having a young man talk about technology. Faced with a barrage of doubts. Lynshin didn&#x27;t pay any attention.</p>
<p>After all, he has never made any achievements in biio medicine. It&#x27;s normal to be questioned. He directly projected the technical solution onto the large screen in the conference room. Then the explanation begins. Everyone, please look at the big screen.</p>
<p>This technological solution mainly uses a type of super fagasite to precisely engulf cancer cells and various viral cells within the human body. As Lynchin continued to explain, the meeting room was filled with constant questioning from the very beginning. Silence fell instantly. Chapter 139. Good news for cancer patients in the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lynch mentioned each parameter. The experts and missians below were even more shocked. It&#x27;s even more outrageous than what Lie Jian Guo did yesterday because they have been deeply involved in the field of bioscience for many years. Naturally, they knew how terrifying this super fagasite was. How is this possible? How did they do that? Academician Jangs face was filled with shock and he murmured in disbelief.</p>
<p>Internationally renowned biologists have also attempted to treat cancer using fagosites, but all of them ended in failure. It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s no way to completely eliminate cancer cells, but rather that they are assimilated and engulfed by cancer cells. [clears throat] Some even accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells. The final result was failure. This has resulted in the fagositic cell approach never being able to leave the laboratory.</p>
<p>Lynch has now proposed a similar solution. It also solved problems that had troubled countless scientists. This is absolutely an unprecedented breakthrough. Li Jang Guoo watched the expressions and reactions of the experts and missians from the side and he was secretly delighted. Huh? That&#x27;ll teach you a lesson for questioning Kobayashi earlier.</p>
<p>Now you finally know what shock really means. Li Jian Guo was secretly gloating. Recalling how shocked he was yesterday, Lie Jian Guo felt a sense of exhilaration like a surf who had been liberated and was now singing a song of triumph. An hour later, Lynshan gave a brief overview of the entire technical solution until Lynch stopped speaking. The entire conference room was eerily quiet.</p>
<p>Everyone looked like they wanted more. They were reflecting on what Lin Shun had just resolved. At the same time, besides being shocked, they also had many technical questions. A moment later, academician Jang first raised a question. Comrade Lin Chun, I would like to ask, how do fagasites achieve 100% accurate identification of cancer cells? And do they also engulf other normal cells? The problem of fagasite recognition has always been a global challenge.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t be solved. That&#x27;s why this devouring strategy was abandoned. Lynchin took a sip of water and explained with a smile. Super fagasytes are created by modifying their underlying genes so that they only engulf cancer cells, bacteria, and viruses in the human body. Once no abnormal viral cells are detected in the human body, it will stop dividing, then slowly die and be excreted from the body through normal metabolism.</p>
<p>Underlying gene modification, academician Jang was taken aback. I never expected that this would involve genetic science. This is the most difficult branch of biological science. Then Lin Shun continued to explain from the genetic level. After listening, academician Jang felt as if he had been enlightened.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like all those previously difficult questions suddenly became clear and understood instantly. Academician Jean couldn&#x27;t help but give Lynchin a thumbs up and exclaimed, &quot;Comrade Lynn, you are something else.&quot; Then a group of experts and raised various technical questions, but Lynshan answered them all calmly. Each technical question is answered. All of these have greatly benefited a group of experts and missians. It was as if Lin Shawn was giving them a vivid masterclass in biological science.</p>
<p>Until the very end, all the experts and missians in the conference room could only sigh with emotion. I never expected that we old folks would have the chance to witness such a groundbreaking achievement in biological science. Yes, it feels like we&#x27;ve wasted all these years. Comrade Lynch, he is simply a prodigy. All the experts and missians were filled with emotion.</p>
<p>They had to admire Lin Chen&#x27;s knowledge. At first, they questioned what achievements Lynchon at such a young age could make in the field of biological sciences. After an hour of explanation, let them completely change their ingrained mindset. This may be the difference between a talented person and a genius. No, it&#x27;s the difference between a talented person and a prodigy genius.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s an insurmountable chasm. This is something that ordinary geniuses cannot do. After everyone was shocked, academician Jeang couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Commrade Lynch, what is the cost of this special drug? Can it be mass-produced?&quot; Upon hearing this, all the experts andademicians turned their attention to Lynch. This is the most important question. Having the technology alone is insufficient for mass production or the success rate of mass production is extremely low.</p>
<p>That also makes it impossible to promote on a large scale. It also has little effect on the current medical industry. They waited expectantly for Lynch&#x27;s answer. Seeing their expectant gazes, Lynch smiled and said, &quot;The cost might be a little high.&quot; Academician Jeang blurted out, &quot;How expensive. The cost of each pill of this special medicine may reach Ten Yuan.</p>
<p>Of course, the volume can be reduced after the quantity is increased. Boom. These words were like a bomb, sending chills down everyone&#x27;s spines. Tenuan, can it be lowered further? I&#x27;ll blanch it. You call this a little pricey.</p>
<p>Even academician Jeang couldn&#x27;t help but swear, damn it, even a cost of 10 yuan is considered expensive. Wouldn&#x27;t those cancer treatment drugs from abroad be incredibly expensive? Previously, a single dose of anti-cancer drug cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, and they all have to be imported. We can set whatever price others want. The key point is that even if you have the money, you might not be able to buy it. Those foreigners simply don&#x27;t export to the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>Not just cancer treatment drugs. This applies to many drugs and medical devices as well. It&#x27;s clearly sold for a very low price overseas. But they took advantage of the fact that the great Sia Kingdom was backward in medical care. They all offered exorbitant prices, ruthlessly reaping the wealth of the people of the Great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Until recent years, the Great Sea Kingdom is making more and more breakthroughs in medicine. The prices of many drugs are also falling sharply. The most obvious example, coronary stent surgery. Previously, all stances were imported from abroad. They often cost tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Ordinary people simply can&#x27;t afford it. The cost was only reduced after domestic production began. A heart stent surgery can be performed for just a few thousand. The same applies to medical devices. Previously, imported ones sold for tens of millions.</p>
<p>Once it&#x27;s made in China, you can buy it for a few million. It&#x27;s all because I didn&#x27;t master the technology. Now the cost of Linshen&#x27;s special medicine is only 10 yuan. This is a godsend for the free health care system currently implemented in the great Sa Kingdom. Comrade Lin Shun, on behalf of the people of the whole country, I thank you.</p>
<p>Academician Jeang approached Lin Shun and bowed deeply in gratitude. The other people in the conference room also stood up and bowed deeply to Lyn Shan in gratitude. Lyn Shan was so frightened that he quickly waved his hand. Everyone, you&#x27;re making me feel so bad. I&#x27;m just proposing a technical solution.</p>
<p>We still need everyone&#x27;s joint efforts to develop and mass-produce this effective drug. Everything I do is for the service of the people. I only hope that the people of our great Sa Kingdom can live better lives and no longer suffer from illness. Upon hearing this, the way everyone in the conference room looked at Lynch changed again. Even after hearing Lynch&#x27;s words, they felt a sense of shame.</p>
<p>None of them expected Lynchan to have such a broad vision. The key point is that Lyn Shan is still so young. That&#x27;s how big a vision and awareness they have. This is what is most precious. They lack the youthful arrogance and restlessness.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they possess a maturity and sense of responsibility beyond their years. Such young people are a blessing to the nation. Lie Jian Guo nodded in satisfaction as he observed the reactions of the crowd. Now I announce a decision. The cancer specific drug project has been officially approved.</p>
<p>All experts suspend all your current work. Everyone must report to the Institute of Biology of the Sia Academy of Sciences within 3 days. We will conduct closed- dooror research and development and strive for mass production within 1 month. The words had barely left his mouth. The experts were instantly thrilled.</p>
<p>I do mass production in 3 months. No problem. With chief engineer Lynn here, we can definitely do it. I&#x27;m calling the school right now to suspend all courses and programs. Everyone was full of energy, their eyes shining.</p>
<p>Chapter 140 controlled nuclear fusion assembly successful after the cancer specific drug project was established. Lynn Shun then began shuttling between the controlled nuclear fusion project and the cancer specific drug project. Most of the time we&#x27;re focusing on cancer specific drugs because controlled nuclear fusion is on the right track. We&#x27;ve now moved on to the final assembly stage. After Lin Shun completed the inheritance of the cancer specific drug, choose the complete technology for unmanned planetary bases and accept its inheritance.</p>
<p>This technology includes the construction of unmanned planetary bases, mineral development and planetary environmental modification among other things. With this technology, we can begin the formal construction of a lunar base, then develop the resources on the moon and the cosmic star stone that he longed for. It&#x27;ll be soon. Once controlled nuclear fusion is successful, we can begin building a lunar base. Lynch was full of anticipation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s policies on improving people&#x27;s livelihoods officially began to be implemented gradually. Many people followed the requirements and began uploading relevant documents to apply for various subsidies. Almost all of them passed in seconds. There are no card verification issues because they are all based on artificial intelligence audits developed using quantum chips and the white emperor intelligent agent. It can completely replace manual review.</p>
<p>There will be no review errors. A mountainous area. A family with five children. The oldest is only 13 years old and the youngest is 3 years old. Originally, because there were many children in the family and neither of them had much education, they were both farmers.</p>
<p>In his spare time, he works as a construction worker in the surrounding area to supplement his family&#x27;s income. Life is still manageable, albeit barely. Since learning about the country&#x27;s new policy, they applied on their phones immediately. The Huawei Quantum Chip phone that I bought not long ago, the affordable model priced at 599. Inside the dilapidated house, the walls were covered with certificates of merit.</p>
<p>Five children, three of whom were younger, were happily playing on the muddy ground outside. The child looked innocent and carefree. Two older children are doing their homework in the room. A middle-aged couple is fiddling with their phones. A moment later, the middle-aged man finally followed the instructions and submitted all the information.</p>
<p>After submitting the application, the middle-aged woman couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Honey, will the government really give us money?&quot; The middle-aged man nodded slightly. Probably. The village committee has already notified us. Hopefully, that way, our lives will be a little easier. They weren&#x27;t very sure.</p>
<p>I was just trying it out. If we could have that, that would be wonderful. If not, they won&#x27;t lose anything. At most, I&#x27;ll just keep working hard and raise my five children. Just when they were worried, the middle-aged man&#x27;s phone beeped with several text message notifications.</p>
<p>He quickly clicked to view it and then instantly became excited. Honey, our application has been approved and the money has already been deposited into our account. Really? The middle-aged woman was still a little skeptical. How could it be so fast? Could it be a scam? Probably not. I also have the bank transfer information here.</p>
<p>Look. After the man finished speaking, he placed the phone in front of his wife. The middle-aged woman looked at it and her voice trembled with excitement. So many. So many zeros.</p>
<p>How much money is this? It&#x27;s 50,000 yuan. The middle-aged man exclaimed excitedly after carefully counting it. 50,000. That&#x27;s a lot of money. The middle-aged couple were so excited they were almost at a loss for words.</p>
<p>This was the first time they had ever seen so much money. Previously, their family savings had never exceeded 1,000 yuan. The government immediately gave them 50,000 yuan. This left them somewhat bewildered. This is the annual child support payment the government provides to them.</p>
<p>As for the newborn subsidy, only those born after the policy was announced are eligible for the 50,000 yuan reward. Their family only qualifies for child care subsidies. Honey, now we can finally live a good life, and the children won&#x27;t have to suffer with us anymore. Thank you to the country. Thank you to the government.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man was so moved by the sight of his five children playing happily that tears welled up in his eyes. Previously, he felt guilty because he couldn&#x27;t provide a good life for his five children, especially when you see that the child&#x27;s academic performance is good. He was also unable to provide his child with a better learning environment. This made him feel even more guilty towards his child. Today, the country not only waves all education fees, they even subsidize childare expenses.</p>
<p>For a middle-aged man, it was like receiving timely warmth in the snow. It gave him hope for life and filled him with anticipation for the future. Then, the middle-aged couple told the children the news. They also teach children to love their country and to be grateful. Let them study hard so that they can serve their country when they grow up.</p>
<p>The children all nodded saying that they would definitely repay their country when they grew up. Similar situation. This occurred in many remote mountainous areas of the Great Sea Kingdom. This can be described as a policy aimed at improving people&#x27;s livelihoods. This is an absolutely tremendous policy for children in mountainous areas.</p>
<p>Policies that can change their lives. This is just the beginning. The subsequent impact will be even greater and wider. Two weeks later, the controlled nuclear fusion laboratory of the China Academy of Sciences. A ring-shaped device 2 m in diameter and 1 m high stands in the laboratory.</p>
<p>The entire device is silver gray and its surface is as smooth as a mirror, subtly emitting a cool, technologically advanced glow. The core component of the ring-shaped device. The superconducting coils are wrapped around the outer layer like a coiled dragon with each coil engraved with intricate patterns. The light blue coolant flowed slowly through the transparent pipes. Report to chief engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>Controlled nuclear fusion assembly is complete. An engineer excitedly reported. Great everyone. Thank you for your hard work. Lynchin was also a little excited.</p>
<p>Huh. It&#x27;s finally finished. In one month, we successfully assembled the controlled nuclear fusion device. I feel like I&#x27;m in a dream right now. The surrounding engineers cheered excitedly.</p>
<p>After a month of working tirelessly day and night, we finally see results today. This is the first controlled nuclear fusion device on Earth. It&#x27;s also the only one. Speaking of controlled nuclear fusion, many countries on Earth are also conducting research and development on Earth. Before Lynn Shin proposed this plan, the Great Sea Kingdom also has its own nuclear fusion project.</p>
<p>It is the best device developed based on Takamat technology. The original plan was to achieve nuclear fusion ignition by 2030. Unexpectedly, Lynchin&#x27;s appearance brought things forward by a full 10 years. Not only that, this controlled nuclear fusion device is much smaller than their original project. It&#x27;s basically a miniature takamac device.</p>
<p>It can even be made smaller in the future. This demonstrates just how advanced the technology Lin Shun provided was. Standing next to Lin Shan, Lie Jian Guo asked in disbelief, &quot;Lynn, we&#x27;ve already built a controlled nuclear fusion device. How long has it been? It&#x27;s only been 28 days since the project was initiated. It was 2 days earlier than the originally planned one month.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo originally thought it would be postponed. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be earlier than planned. The key point is that the controlled nuclear fusion we are witnessing is truly amazing. Not only is it small in size, but its appearance and internal structure also exude a sci-fi feel. That&#x27;s what he found unbelievable.</p>
<p>Lynn Shins eyes were full of confidence and determination as he slowly said, &quot;Eldderly, we have indeed completed it. Next is the ignition test. Wait until ignition is successful. Our great SA kingdom will officially enter the era of controlled nuclear fusion energy, completely get rid of excessive dependence on traditional energy, and achieve energy self-sufficiency and sustainable development.&quot; &quot;When will the ignition test begin?&quot; Li Jian Guo asked excitedly. &quot;Right now.&quot; Chapter 141.</p>
<p>and the sun that never dies. Amidst everyone&#x27;s anticipation, Lynchin suddenly became serious. Immediately conduct the final checks before ignition. Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn. The engineers instantly suppressed their excitement.</p>
<p>Then a final check was conducted on the controlled nuclear fusion device. The superconducting coil meets the ignition standards. Vacuum chamber pressure test complete. Sufficient reserves of nuclear fusion fuel. Lynshan carefully reviewed and approved each report.</p>
<p>He wanted to ensure that nothing went wrong. Lie Jian Guo stood aside, watching Lin Shun, who was completely focused on his work and felt a surge of emotion. These things could clearly be left to the engineers to determine, but Lynch insisted on doing it himself. This proves that Lynchin attached extreme importance to this ignition experiment. He knew that if controlled nuclear fusion succeeded, it would completely change humanity&#x27;s energy system.</p>
<p>This will usher the great Sia Kingdom into a completely new era of development. A moment later, all checks have been completed. No problem. And finally, it undergoes a smart detection process. No problems were found.</p>
<p>Seeing the final result, Lynshin nodded in satisfaction and immediately gave the order. Now move the controlled nuclear fusion device to the testing lab. Receive. The engineers immediately sprang into action. Not long after controlled nuclear fusion was moved to a dedicated testing laboratory.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a sealed space inside. Even if problems are found during testing, it will not have any impact on the outside world. Inside the test observation room, Lin Shun Li Jang Guo and others were watching the big screen. Chief Engineer Lynn, everything is ready. Begin refueling.</p>
<p>Receive. A moment later, the engineer excitedly reported, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, fuel loading complete. Everything is ready. The words had barely left his mouth. All the engineers turned to look at Lynch.</p>
<p>Their eyes were full of expectation. Lynch nodded slightly, a hint of excitement in his eyes. Oldly, &quot;It&#x27;s about to begin.&quot; &quot;All right,&quot; Li Jian Guo said, suppressing his excitement. &quot;Let&#x27;s begin.&quot; The eyes of the more than 30 engineers were filled with tension. They all prayed to the gods and Buddhas in their hearts.</p>
<p>They mentally prayed to every single one of them they could think of. Therefore, the ultimate goal of science is metaphysics. Even scientists are no exception. Attention everyone. Ignition countdown begins.</p>
<p>10 98. The countdown began and everyone held their breath, their hearts pounding in their throats. 3 2 1 ignition. Lynshin gently pressed the start button. Boom.</p>
<p>There were no sensational or memorable moments. All I could see on the monitor screen was a crazy surge in various data. Energy output power is increasing. Energy constraint normal. Temperature rise is normal.</p>
<p>The engineers looked at the data points with excitement in their eyes. At this point, controlled nuclear fusion had transformed into a dazzling ball of energy. If not viewed on a large screen, even the brightest light can blind people. That light, more intense than the sun, was now firmly contained within the controlled nuclear fusion device. Li Jang Guoo watched this scene with awe, his eyes filled with excitement and exhilaration.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s done. We finally succeeded. Lie Jian Guo screamed wildly in his heart. If it weren&#x27;t for saving face, he would have cheered loudly by now. Stable energy output.</p>
<p>The temperature has stabilized at 1.2° C. Initiate positive feedback. Lynch looked at each piece of data on the screen and began to get a little excited. It&#x27;s come to this. It can be basically confirmed that controlled nuclear fusion has been successful.</p>
<p>Next, let&#x27;s see how long it stays stable. Good. Reaching this point proves that we have succeeded. Lynchin had just finished speaking. The surrounding engineers cheered instantly.</p>
<p>We did it. We finally succeeded. Haha. We finally succeeded. Although there were some flaws in the process, we still succeeded.</p>
<p>W I&#x27;m so excited. I witnessed the whole thing. This is the future of our great Sia Kingdom. The engineers in the observation room were still celebrating. The success of controlled nuclear fusion means that the great sea kingdom will never have to worry about energy problems again because dutyium and tridium are virtually inexhaustible resources on blue star.</p>
<p>The engineers finally breathed a sigh of relief. Their faces beamed with excitement and joy as they hugged and high-fived each other. Many people still had tears of emotion glistening in their eyes. Li Jang Wo walked up to Lynn Shun and patted him hard on the shoulder. Kobayashi, he said excitedly.</p>
<p>You have made history. Lynch shook his head slightly. It wasn&#x27;t me. It&#x27;s all thanks to everyone. I&#x27;m just just then the console suddenly emitted a rapid alarm.</p>
<p>The red warning light started flashing. Warning. Energy output has surged abnormally. The engineer&#x27;s cheers vanished instantly. Lynch&#x27;s face darkened and he immediately moved closer to the screen.</p>
<p>its plasma instability. He quickly assessed the situation and ordered, &quot;Activate the backup magnetic field confinement system immediately.&quot; Li Jang Wos heart jumped into his throat. Is the hope that has just been ignited about to be extinguished? Backup system activated. Restoration of constraint strength. Energy output is stabilizing.</p>
<p>The engineer&#x27;s voice rang out again, filled with the relief of surviving a disaster. Lynchin stared at the screen until the curve stabilized again before he breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;What just happened?&quot; Li Jian Guo asked hurriedly. Lynchan frowned. It might have been a slight deviation in the fuel mixture ratio, but it has been resolved.</p>
<p>He paused, then said, &quot;It seems we still need to accelerate the pace of lunar development. Only helium 3 on the moon can prevent this from happening. Most importantly, there are millions of tons of helium 3 on the moon. It is the best raw material for controlled nuclear fusion. It can be used by the great sea kingdom for a thousand years.</p>
<p>A cleaner raw material for controlled nuclear fusion than dutyium and tridium. It is also more stable. If helium 3 had been used as the fusion material, the unstable energy output would not have occurred because helium 3 does not produce high energy neutrons during fusion. This unique characteristic can fundamentally solve the problem of nuclear radiation from waste. Moreover, it is even easier to convert into electrical energy.</p>
<p>Even the waste generated is completely pollutionfree. It is cleaner than solar power and wind power. Li Jang Wos expression was serious. Shaolin, you&#x27;re right. We still need to develop lunar resources as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded. Next, it&#x27;s time to develop the moon. Chapter 142, Guang Han Palace Base. Controlled nuclear fusion ignition successful. This indicates that the energy problem of the lunar base has been effectively solved.</p>
<p>The next step is to begin constructing a lunar base and developing lunar resources. Helium 3 in particular must be developed as soon as possible. Everyone, please continue with the testing of other projects. We will strive to perfect the relevant mass production process parameters as quickly as possible. Lynshin gave instructions to the excited engineer.</p>
<p>Yes, chief engineer Lynn. All the engineers responded with excitement. The successful ignition of controlled nuclear fusion proves that the controlled nuclear fusion device is working properly. Next, the goal is to convert the energy generated by controlled nuclear fusion into stable electrical energy output. This allows it to provide a continuous supply of electricity.</p>
<p>This step also has detailed technical parameters. Engineers only need to follow the instructions to complete the final steps. At this point, Lynn Shun is basically out of the picture. Oldie, let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s go back and discuss the development of lunar resources.</p>
<p>Good. The two left the testing room first. Other engineers continued to conduct various tests on controlled nuclear fusion office. Lie Jian Guo poured Lin Chin a cup of tea. Then he poured himself another glass and asked with some anticipation.</p>
<p>Xiaolin, what are your thoughts on the lunar base? Lynch picked up his teacup, took a sip and said, &quot;A lunar base? I already have a complete plan for a lunar base. What? Lie Jian Guo was just about to drink his tea when he was so shocked by Lynchins words that he almost knocked over his teacup. He quickly put down his teacup and asked excitedly, &quot;Do you really have a complete plan for a lunar base?&quot; Lynchin nodded emphatically. Lie Jian Guo sighed deeply and exclaimed, &quot;Shaolin, you&#x27;re truly a prodigy. How long has it been since we had a cure for cancer? Surprisingly, there&#x27;s now a more comprehensive plan for a lunar base.</p>
<p>How could a human possibly do that? It&#x27;s even more outrageous than a monster. In the past, it would take Lynchin one or two months to propose a new project. Now they&#x27;re raising one every two weeks. That&#x27;s so fast. It&#x27;s something he&#x27;s finding hard to adapt to.</p>
<p>No wonder Lynshin said before that the talent pool of the Great Sea Kingdom is not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the upcoming technological explosion. At this rate, not only will the talents of the great sea kingdom be insufficient, but the talents of the entire blue star will also be insufficient, especially the lunar base. That&#x27;s a base for humans to survive on uninhabited planets. If successful, it will enable the development of lunar resources. It also allows us to develop all the resources of Mars and even other planets.</p>
<p>The more lio thought about it, the more excited he became. Xialin, where&#x27;s the plan? Can I take a look at it? Lynshin touched his nose embarrassed and said, &quot;It&#x27;s not finished yet. Itll take another two days.&quot; &quot;Uh&quot; Li Jian Guo was taken aback for a moment, then realized what he meant and laughed. It&#x27;s all right, Shaolin. 2 days will pass quickly.</p>
<p>Although, I was a little disappointed, but it was already a pleasant surprise. After all, Lin Shins rapid development of a complete lunar base plan far exceeded his expectations. &quot;Mr. Lee, I can give you a brief explanation.&quot; Seeing that Lie Jang Wo looked a little disappointed, Lyn Shin couldn&#x27;t help but give an introduction. Upon hearing this, Li Jang Wos eyes lit up.</p>
<p>The lunar base is mainly responsible for mineral resource development. He needs to modify the lunar environment to create one suitable for human habitation. Whether it&#x27;s a gravity system, a supply system, or any other system, it all needs to be recyclable. We should make good use of the water resources on the moon which will solve the problem of water and oxygen supply. At the same time, the lunar mining rover needs to be fully automated.</p>
<p>The collected minerals need to be processed into preliminary products on the moon before being transported back to Earth or to a later space city. Lie Jiano listened and nodded in agreement. Each time Lynchin mentioned something, Li Jang Guo was shocked. Whether it&#x27;s the moon&#x27;s gravity system or its oxygen circulation system, these are all topics that are currently being researched worldwide. But Lynchin clearly has a corresponding technical solution.</p>
<p>For example, the space station. Now, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s no gravity system. Humans are always in a weightless environment when they are on the space station. Over time, it will cause irreversible damage to the human body. It causes permanent physical trauma.</p>
<p>This is why every now and then the reason why astronauts on the space station need to be rotated. If the gravity problem can be solved, that problem won&#x27;t happen. Then, Lynn Shun continued. In terms of energy supply, in addition to the electricity provided by controlled nuclear fusion, we are simultaneously developing solar power as a backup to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Lie Jian Guo nodded.</p>
<p>Shaolin, we have the most advanced technology in solar power generation, so there&#x27;s definitely no problem. Not enough, Lynch shook his head. Currently, the solar power conversion rate in our country is too low with most only achieving a photoelectric conversion rate of 20%. At least 70% is required to meet the requirements. What more than 70%.</p>
<p>Liian Guo was shocked by this data again. Currently, polychristallin silicon is the most widely used material worldwide with a conversion rate of only 13% to 17%. Even with monoryrystalline silicon, the highest conversion rate is only 22%. If it can really reach 70%, it will absolutely revolutionize the entire solar power generation industry. Shaolin, our technology simply can&#x27;t do that, Li Jang Guoo said with a helpless, bitter smile.</p>
<p>Who says it can&#x27;t be done? Li Jian Guo was stunned, then became excited. Shaolin, what do you mean? That&#x27;s right. My lunar base plan includes brand new solar power generation technology, Lin Shan explained with a smile. This is just one of the technologies in the complete set of technologies for a lunar base. If it were just a technical plan for a lunar base, he would have completed it long ago.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s because it contains so many classification techniques. That&#x27;s why it takes so long to conduct various experiments in the Heritage Space Laboratory. Really? That&#x27;s great. Li Jang Guoo was so excited that he slapped his thigh. Shaolin, you really are always giving us surprises.</p>
<p>70% photoelectric conversion efficiency. I can&#x27;t even imagine it. It has to be possible to actually do it. Even without controlled nuclear fusion, the great Xia Kingdom will never have to worry about energy shortages. Seeing Lie Jang Wos excitement, Lynchin couldn&#x27;t help but pour cold water on his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, don&#x27;t get too excited yet. We should first gather the relevant talents and prepare for the project. Two days from now, we will establish the lunar base project team. These include a lunar base, lunar mineral refining, lunar mining rovers, and a whole range of other projects.</p>
<p>This project will involve multiple fields and is the most complex one yet. Although the project is complex, but as long as the lunar base is completed, the subsequent construction of the space city will then become much easier because many of the technologies involved share commonalities. Lie Jian Guo suppressed his excitement and solemnly assured him. Shaolin, don&#x27;t worry. I guarantee I&#x27;ll gather the relevant talent for you within 2 days.</p>
<p>Okay, you go ahead with your work. I&#x27;ll go check on the progress of the cancer treatment. After Lynchin finished speaking, he got up and left. Controlled nuclear fusion has been achieved. Next, he needs to expedite the mass production of the cancer specific drug project.</p>
<p>In this way, he can devote himself wholeheartedly to the lunar base project. Chapter 143. The terrifying super fagositic cell institute of biology. Lynn Shun had just entered the laboratory. Inside the laboratory, a group of experts andademicians were busy with something.</p>
<p>At the same time, we heard academician Jean shout in an excited voice. Preparing to begin the first invivo experiment with super faguses. Prepare for live injection. Keep a detailed record of the entire reaction process. All the experts and became excited.</p>
<p>They looked at the white mice tightly bound in a glass jar on the experimental table. Now it&#x27;s time to witness a miracle. They&#x27;ve already moved on to live experiments. It seems the progress is faster than originally planned. Lynch secretly praised him.</p>
<p>At this time, academician Jang and others were also excited when they noticed Lin Chin&#x27;s arrival. Chief engineer Lynn, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. We&#x27;re just about to conduct a live experiment. You can help us check it out. After this period of time of getting to know each other, they already knew about Lynch&#x27;s research achievements in other fields.</p>
<p>She idolizes Lynch even more. Now, everyone looks at Lyn Shon with nothing but reverence. Lynch looked at the white mouse inside the glass case. It&#x27;s weak breathing, dull fur, and swollen belly. All of this proves that this is a mouse with latestage liver cancer.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s begin. Okay. Chief engineer Lynn. Academician Jeang responded excitedly. Then he instructed the engineers to begin the experiment.</p>
<p>The two engineers were wearing sterile gloves. He was holding a syringe. The syringe contained mature super fagasites. Engineers expertly injected the super fagasites into mice. Seeing this scene, everyone held their breath throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>Their eyes were filled with tension and anticipation. He stared intently at the little white mouse. They were afraid of missing any reaction. Almost there. We have to succeed.</p>
<p>Academician Jeang clenched his fists and prayed silently in his heart. The other experts and all had almost the same expression. Even Lynchin started to get a little nervous. Time passed second by second. 1 minute later, the mice still showed no reaction.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s as if the super fagasites are completely useless. Some impatient experts began to worry. Has it failed? Lynshin smiled reassuringly and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry. Even super fagasites need time to divide.&quot; Hearing Lyn Shin&#x27;s words of comfort, the tense experts breathed a slight sigh of relief. 5 minutes passed quickly.</p>
<p>Just then, the white mouse finally started to move. They&#x27;re like a corpse suddenly twitched its paw. This scene, this instantly excited academician Jang and others. It moved. It moved.</p>
<p>The fagasites are working. They quickly looked at the testing screen. The curve that originally represented cancer cells began to gradually decline. The cancer cells in the mice are really decreasing. One of the engineers shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Academician Jang and the others were filled with excitement. Even Lin Shan breathed a sigh of relief. The cancer cell curve is declining. This proves that fagasites are playing a role. Everyone continued to watch the screen every minute.</p>
<p>The curve representing the decrease in cancer cells accelerates by one point. 10 minutes later, the cancer cell curve plummeted like an avalanche. The mouse&#x27;s originally dull for gradually regained its shine. They even started to struggle. If it weren&#x27;t tied up, it would probably be running around like crazy.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve reached this point. The success of super fagicites has been proven. 20 minutes later, the curve for cancer cells dropped to zero. This moment, academician Jang and others cheered immediately. Haha, we did it.</p>
<p>We really succeeded in eliminating the cancer cells. This is incredible. In my 40 years of biological science research, this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen such outrageous treatment results. This is a revolutionary breakthrough in biological genetics. It&#x27;s a boon to humanity.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a milestone in conquering the cancer challenge. The experts were so excited that they danced with joy and their eyes were filled with tears. Although it was only the first live experiment, but the results have already proven the terrifying nature of super fagasites. This also verifies that the technical solution provided by Lynchun is completely correct. Lynch was also very excited.</p>
<p>The super fagicite experiment was successful. This suggests that a cure for cancer is not far off. Next, all that&#x27;s needed is for clinical trials to confirm that there are no problems. Then mass production can begin. It can also lead to the development of other types of highly effective treatments.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lynchin pressed his hand down and said calmly, &quot;Everyone calm down. Now, we need to determine whether all the cancer cells in the mice&#x27;s bodies have been eliminated. It is also necessary to determine whether the super fagicites damage the normal cells of the mice.&quot; Chief engineer Lynn is right. Let&#x27;s go check it out right away. Academician Jang immediately called over several experts.</p>
<p>A comprehensive examination of the mice began. 10 minutes later, the results are in. Academician Jang excitedly approached Lin Chun. Chief engineer Lynn. Everything is normal.</p>
<p>All the cancer cells in the mice have disappeared and their bodily functions are slowly recovering. At the same time, the superfagites also begin to stop dividing and gradually die. Lynch nodded in satisfaction after listening. Good. Next comes the most important part, clinical trials.</p>
<p>I suggest that the first clinical trial be conducted in 10 days. Clinical trials in 10 days. Academician Jeang was taken aback then became excited. Chief engineer Len, I support it. Other experts andmissians expressed their support.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fact that this is only the first animal experiment, but it&#x27;s already perfect. In the next 10 days, they could conduct more live experiments to supplement the experimental data. Make sure there are no problems before the clinical trials. Seeing that no one objected, Lynn Shun continued to give instructions. The first batch of 100 clinical volunteers will be recruited.</p>
<p>It should cover a variety of terminally ill patients with diverse ages and physical conditions to ensure comprehensive data. Okay. Chief engineer Lynn. Academician Jeang nodded in agreement. That afternoon, the official website of the Seyaku Academy released an important announcement.</p>
<p>Recruiting patients with advanced cancer to participate in clinical trials of a cancer specific drug. Number of recruits 100. Registration period from now until 3 days later. Trial location special needs ward peaking union medical college hospital. Note all costs during the trial will be covered by the government and follow-up treatment will be provided free of charge if the trial is successful.</p>
<p>The announcement was released. The entire internet erupted in excitement. What? A clinical trial for a cancer specific drug? Has the SEA Academy of Sciences made another major breakthrough in cancer treatment? Leukemia is also on the list. W My mom finally has hope. Whether it&#x27;s true or not, I&#x27;m going to try.</p>
<p>I want to sign up my father who has terminal cancer. Families of terminally ill patients in major hospitals have gone completely mad. Regardless of whether it can really be cured, they are willing to try as long as there is a glimmer of hope. In just half an hour, the number of applicants exceeded 100,000. It continued to rise after that.</p>
<p>Chapter 144. The veteran&#x27;s last wish. This is evident. How popular is this volunteer recruitment notice issued by the Seyaku Academy, a hospital in Beijing. In the VIP ward of the oncology department, an elderly man lay in bed wearing an oxygen mask, his breathing very weak.</p>
<p>The old man is 98 years old and is a veteran of the War of Resistance against Japan. His son, Shaneua, was there to take care of him. At this moment, Chunwa&#x27;s eyes were red. He held in his hand the hospital&#x27;s 10th critical condition notice. &quot;Dad,&quot; the doctor said, &quot;we can go home.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s more comfortable at home.&quot; Chunua&#x27;s voice choked with emotion. &quot;In fact, the doctor told him that Mr. Chun had at most 10 days to live. It might take even less time. He was in the late stages of cancer and was 98 years old.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s too late to save it.&quot; Upon hearing this, old master Chin slowly opened his eyes, a trace of resentment flashing in his cloudy eyes. He fought against the Japanese and the Americans on the battlefield back then. They survived by the skin of their teeth. But now he&#x27;s going to be stricken by a minor cancer, but he didn&#x27;t want to keep going like this. And Weekly said, &quot;Then let&#x27;s go back.</p>
<p>Before you go back, take me to see the flag raising ceremony one more time.&quot; Good. Just then, the nurse rushed in holding a phone. Grandpa Chun, Uncle Chun, great news. The Sia Academy of Sciences is recruiting volunteers for its clinical trials for latestage cancer. What? Chungo looked up abruptly and grabbed the phone.</p>
<p>I was overjoyed when I saw the announcement. He turned and knelt down, holding Old Master Chin&#x27;s hand excitedly, saying, &quot;Dad, there&#x27;s hope for you.&quot; Old Master Chin&#x27;s eyes lit up instantly. But it quickly went dark again. Sigh. I&#x27;m too old for that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not going to compete with other younger patients for this spot. Let&#x27;s go home. Dad, don&#x27;t worry about anything else. I&#x27;ll register you. Shenu wouldn&#x27;t listen at all.</p>
<p>Having finally seen a glimmer of hope. How could he give up? He immediately took out his phone and started operating it. After filling in all the information, I submitted it without any hesitation. Grandpa Chan looked at his son&#x27;s actions with a sense of helplessness. Oh, what can I say to you? I&#x27;m already satisfied with how long I&#x27;ve lived.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to see my old comrades. I want to tell them that our country is now strong and no one will dare to bully us anymore. Upon hearing this, the nurse standing nearby immediately teared up. Jeangua became even more determined to keep his father alive. He prayed silently in his heart.</p>
<p>It absolutely has to pass. At the same time, on the international internet, this announcement from the Shaman Academy of Sciences has sparked heated discussions. Oh my god. Has the Great Sea Kingdom conquered cancer? Impossible. The pharmaceutical industry in the Great Sea Kingdom is far behind that of our foreign countries.</p>
<p>It must be a lie. I hope it&#x27;s true. This would be a monumental feat that benefits all of humanity. I feel it&#x27;s true. After all, the technology of the Great Sea Kingdom has advanced by leaps and bounds recently.</p>
<p>Maybe they really have cracked it. Most rational foreign nizens hope that the great SA kingdom will truly conquer cancer. After all, more than 10 million people die from cancer every year. They almost always died after being financially ruined and tortured beyond recognition. This shows that cancer is currently the greatest threat to humanity.</p>
<p>If the great SA kingdom can truly conquer cancer, people all over the world are delighted to see this. Especially for cancer patients, it&#x27;s as if they&#x27;ve seen a glimmer of hope for survival again. Great SIA kingdom, you must succeed. God bless the great SIA kingdom. May they succeed in conquering cancer this time.</p>
<p>Hopefully, once the great SIA kingdom is conquered, this technology can be adopted globally. Many cancer patients are praying. All they wanted was to live a good life. The level of medical care in developed countries abroad is high. Many countries even promote the slogan of free healthcare, but in fact, they spent more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the waiting time for them to see a doctor is extremely long. You don&#x27;t need to go to the hospital for minor illnesses nor for major illnesses. Even if there is hope, the long waiting list can delay their progress from mild to severe cases. This is the biggest drawback of free healthcare. Fortunately, the free medical policy currently implemented in the great sea kingdom is different from that in other countries.</p>
<p>Anyone who registers will be reviewed by an intelligent agent and cued according to priority. Moreover, the system will continue to be optimized, especially after Linshen&#x27;s cancer specific drug was launched. Free medical care in the great Sia Kingdom would then become very simple. However, those international pharmaceutical companies, people began to panic at the announcement from the Xiaku Academy. The Eagle, the headquarters of Mercy, an emergency meeting is currently being held.</p>
<p>Chairman Davis expressionless asked in a deep voice. You&#x27;ve all seen the announcement released by the SIA Academy of Sciences of the Great Sea Kingdom, right? What are your thoughts? In the conference room, everyone looked at each other in bewilderment. It seemed that neither of them wanted to speak first. In the past, the Great Sa Kingdom would have claimed to have conquered cancer. They&#x27;ll definitely laugh and won&#x27;t take it to heart at all.</p>
<p>But things are different now. The speed of technological development in the Great Sa Kingdom is terrifying. This made them no longer dare to underestimate the great sea kingdom. Even in the backward medical industry of the great sea kingdom, they also became more cautious. Seeing that no one spoke, Davis frowned slightly and pointed to a cancer medical expert.</p>
<p>Kenneth, what do you say? When medical expert Kenneth was called out, he had no choice but to bite the bullet and speak. Everyone, I believe that the great Sia Kingdom has definitely made some breakthroughs in the field of cancer. Otherwise, they certainly wouldn&#x27;t dare to openly recruit clinical volunteers. I suggest that we prepare for the impact in advance. Kenneth knew perfectly well.</p>
<p>If the great SEA Kingdom truly conquers cancer, that would be a devastating blow to their company because there are precedents to learn from as long as it&#x27;s a technology that was broken through by the Great Sia Kingdom. Their overseas companies will all suffer terribly. This is true for industries such as mobile phones and automobiles. Once the great sea kingdom breaks through, it will surpass it. That was their end.</p>
<p>They used to be able to use the sales ban as leverage. But now that the great sea kingdom is so powerful, who would dare to have such thoughts? Davis&#x27;s expression turned somewhat grim after hearing this. Couldn&#x27;t it just be a smokeokc screen they&#x27;ve put out? Or perhaps they only made breakthroughs in certain areas? Won&#x27;t this affect our business? He still didn&#x27;t quite believe that the great Sea Kingdom would really make any major breakthroughs if cancer were really that easy to conquer. They would have conquered it all long ago. Seeing Davis&#x27;s reaction, other medical experts began to offer their advice.</p>
<p>Chairman, we should still be cautious. That&#x27;s right. We can&#x27;t be like other industries and be completely overwhelmed. Yes, chairman, we should still make preparations in advance just in case. Seeing this, Davis also began to take things seriously.</p>
<p>Next, they began to discuss counter measures. The first priority is to lower the price and sell the cancer drugs on a large scale before they are available in the great SEA kingdom. At the same time, we will increase investment in research and development. We strive to develop drugs with better therapeutic effects. It&#x27;s not just Merc.</p>
<p>The top 10 pharmaceutical companies across the entire planet have all begun to pay attention. It&#x27;s like the boy who cried wolf. Chapter 145. the terrifying treatment effects of a cancer fighting drug. 3 days later, while everyone waited, the official website of the Seyaku Academy has officially announced the list of 100 participants selected for clinical trials.</p>
<p>The families of the selected patients were instantly excited and thrilled. Great, we were selected. My mom has a chance. W I saw my dad&#x27;s list. I&#x27;m so excited.</p>
<p>Honey, you&#x27;re saved. You have to hang in there. Some are happy. Some are sad. Those patients in their families who were not selected were disappointed.</p>
<p>Why wasn&#x27;t I selected? My husband only has three months to live. Why? My son has latestage leukemia and only has one month left to live. My mother only has 2 months left. Why can&#x27;t there be more spots? Those who weren&#x27;t selected started to get anxious. Some patients families even got anxious and began to suspect that there was something fishy going on.</p>
<p>They were overly anxious, which is somewhat understandable. The first 100 patients are definitely the kind who could die at any moment. Only these patients can have their maximum effectiveness of cancer specific drugs tested in the shortest amount of time. Not to mention, as long as the first batch of clinical trials is successful, the first and third times will begin soon. Later, it was put into mass production.</p>
<p>There will be many time intervals between these events. Those who still have a few months to live have nothing to worry about. A hospital in Beijing. Chinwa looked at the names on the list. My gaze lingered on line 37.</p>
<p>Name: Chun Jang Wo. Age 98. Illness: Latestage lung cancer. Dad, you made the cut, huh? Chun Wang was suddenly knelt down in front of the hospital bed, tightly grasped the old man&#x27;s withered hands, and spoke with excitement in his voice. Old Master Chin slowly opened his eyes, which had been squinting.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth, and a faint voice came from under the oxygen mask. You were selected? Yes. Chun Wuin nodded emphatically, his voice choked with emotion. Youll definitely get better. Well go watch the flag raising ceremony then.</p>
<p>Okay. Old Master Chin nodded slightly, then closed his eyes again. He was already very weak at this moment. Even speaking is quite strenuous. Chinua did not disturb Old Master Chin.</p>
<p>I just quietly stayed by your side. On the internet, the list released by the Seyaku Academy has once again become a trending topic. The comment section was filled with excited discussions. I can&#x27;t wait for the results in 10 days. I hope it will succeed so that countless lives can be saved.</p>
<p>I believe the Academy of Sciences of Shaman will not let us down. Looking forward to it. 10 days passed in the blink of an eye. The entire clinical trial was broadcast live. There is only one goal to give the people of the great Sia Kingdom peace of mind.</p>
<p>Half an hour before the start of the clinical trial. The number of viewers watching CCTV&#x27;s live broadcast has exceeded 500 million. The comment section went completely wild. We finally waited for this day. I&#x27;m about to witness a medical miracle.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m so excited. Let&#x27;s get started. I can&#x27;t wait. It was exactly 9:00 a.m. The live stream then cut to the special needs ward of Peing Union Medical College Hospital.</p>
<p>Academician Jeang, wearing a white coat, stood in front of the camera, but his voice was unusually calm. Dear viewers, today we will witness a historic moment in which our great SIA kingdom conquers cancer. Next, we will conduct our first trial of a cancer specific drug. The words had barely left his mouth. The live stream cameras switched to the patient.</p>
<p>At this time, all the patients were lying in their hospital beds. Some had a relatively normal complexion, but some of them had expressions of pain on their faces. They were clearly tormented by illness, and they were making their last stand. This was after she had been given painkillers. If they hadn&#x27;t received the injection, all the patients would probably be in great pain, but this pain will soon disappear.</p>
<p>9:10 Academician Jang announced the start directly. The nurses came forward carrying trays. On the tray, the white capsules gleamed faintly. Now, we will administer cancer specific drugs to all patients. Close-up shot.</p>
<p>The nurse held the capsule to the patients mouth and then offered them warm water. Every movement was made with utmost care. The live stream chat exploded with comments. Is this the drug that can kill cancer cells? It looks like a regular capsule. Does it really work? Keep going.</p>
<p>You must succeed. In the observation room, the atmosphere was extremely tense. Lie Jian Guo stood in front of the screen with his hands behind his back, his knuckles white. He glanced at Lynchin from time to time, his eyes filled with anxiety. Xialin, do you think there might be any problems? Lynchin smiled confidently and said calmly, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Mr.</p>
<p>Lee. It will be 100% successful.&quot; &quot;These 10 days.&quot; Academician Jang and his team conducted numerous more experiments. The results were always perfect with no problems whatsoever. &quot;That&#x27;s good,&quot; Li Jang Wu nodded. All eyes were focused on the patient on the large monitoring screen.</p>
<p>On the screen, the last patient also took the capsule. Academician Jangs voice rang out again. &quot;The medication has been taken. Next, we will monitor the changes in cancer cells in the patients body in real time. Time passed second by second.</p>
<p>No one sent any comments in the live stream. Everyone stared at the data curve on the screen. In the observation room, the engineers stared intently at the testing equipment, barely daring to breathe. Li Jang Wos breathing became increasingly rapid. He stared at the red curve representing cancer cells on the screen, his heart pounding in his throat.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#x27;t anything changed yet? It&#x27;s been 3 minutes already. Lynshin patted him on the shoulder and reassured him. Oldly superfagites need time to recognize cancer cells. Don&#x27;t worry. Just then, an engineer suddenly exclaimed, &quot;It&#x27;s moving.</p>
<p>The curve is moving.&quot; Everyone&#x27;s eyes instantly focused on the screen. The red curve representing cancer cells begins to slowly decline. The price has really dropped. Patient in bed 17, cancer cell activity decreased by 5%. bed 37.</p>
<p>Cancer cell activity decreased by 8%. The live stream chat exploded with comments. Wow, it really dropped in price. That&#x27;s amazing. This is simply a miracle drug.</p>
<p>It works so fast. What kind of miraculous medicine is this? It works in just a few minutes. Outrageous. If it weren&#x27;t for the live stream, I would have thought it was a fabricated video. Everyone was shocked by this scene.</p>
<p>The patients and their families were especially moved to tears. There is hope. Spring has come for us cancer patients. Mah, I don&#x27;t have to die anymore. I don&#x27;t have to lose my hair anymore.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to grow my hair long. Dad, if you can see this from heaven, the country has conquered cancer. Inside the testing room, 10 minutes later, academician Jeang immediately shouted, &quot;Statistical data.&quot; The data was quickly compiled. Academician Jeang, among 100 patients, the activity of cancer cells decreased by an average of 25%. Among them, 23 patients saw a decrease of more than 30%.</p>
<p>Boom. The observation room erupted in excitement. Success. The preliminary results are successful. 25% 25% in just 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo looked at Lyn Shun, his voice trembling. Shaolin, we did it. We really did it. Lynch smiled and nodded, looking at the screen. This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>in the live stream room. The number of online viewers instantly exceeded 800 million and the barrage of comments exploded. Siaki Yuan is awesome. Humanity is finally going to defeat cancer. Thank you to the Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the researchers. Everyone was immersed in joy. Although this is only preliminary data, but it&#x27;s enough to upend the entire world. In 10 minutes, 25% of cancer cells were eliminated. Which pharmaceutical company in the world can do that? Chapter 146.</p>
<p>A resounding success. A new milestone. On the other side, the patients families were even more agitated. Father, old master Chun on the screen. When I heard that all patients had experienced a minimum reduction of 20% in cancer cells, I burst into tears of joy.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s great. It really works. Dad, you can continue to enjoy your family time. Beside him, his wife, her eyes red rimmed, gently patted his shoulder. Wagua.</p>
<p>Dad will get better. Chunua nodded emphatically, then stared intently at the screen, unwilling to look away for even a second. On the other side, a mother holding her child watched her husband&#x27;s brow gradually relax on the screen and suddenly burst into tears. The child was startled and started sobbing. She quickly hugged the child, wiping away her tears and smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Baby, don&#x27;t be afraid. Daddy&#x27;s almost better. Daddy will be home with us soon.&quot; The surrounding family members nodded in agreement, and some took out their phones to share the good news with their families. Their voices filled with barely suppressed excitement. Mom, did you see that? The cancer cells have gone down.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s hope for Dad. Honey, just wait a little longer. We&#x27;ll be reunited soon. Honey, hang in there a little longer. Mom will go buy you your favorite strawberries right away.</p>
<p>In the family quarters, cries and laughter mingled together, and every word was filled with the hope of rebirth. They initially signed up with just a sliver of hope. Even if it&#x27;s unsuccessful, it&#x27;s still good to reduce some of the patients suffering. Unexpected, the effect is so good. In just 10 minutes, the patients condition had already improved.</p>
<p>For their families, it was an absolutely incredible surprise. They are now even more eager for the moment when the patient recovers. At the same time, the international internet was also in an uproar. My god, is this magic? It worked in just a few minutes. How many more surprises does the Great Sa Kingdom hold that we don&#x27;t know about? God, please, great Sia Kingdom, sell this medicine to our country.</p>
<p>My grandfather is still waiting. Where are those who said the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s medical system was backward? Come out and show yourselves. I want to immigrate to the Great Sa Kingdom right now. Does anyone know how to apply? In the comments section, the voices of doubt that had once been raised have vanished without a trace, leaving only awe and anticipation. But the situation is quite different for pharmaceutical companies abroad.</p>
<p>Merk company Ltd. The conference room was deathly silent. Davis stared at the live stream, seemingly unable to believe his eyes, his voice. This is impossible. Absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Kenneth&#x27;s face turned deathly pale and the abyss trembled. This is outrageous. How can there be a cancer treatment drug that works so quickly? How exactly did they do it? He has dedicated decades to the field of cancer research. No technology has ever been able to achieve this effect. It&#x27;s unbelievable that a human could do this.</p>
<p>The other executives exchanged bewildered glances, their eyes filled with panic. Chairman, what do we do now? Should we lower the price of the drugs further? Should we continue to increase investment? Davis remained silent for a moment before speaking with deep resentment. Stop everything. Production of all cancer treatment drugs shall be suspended for the time being. Let&#x27;s find out whether the great Sia Kingdom can massproduce it before we talk about it.</p>
<p>Now, he can only try to minimize the losses. Will their company survive? It all depends on whether the Great Sea Kingdom can quickly mass-produce this cancer specific drug. If it takes several years before mass production, then they still have a chance. But is it really possible that mass production will not take several years? Davis wasn&#x27;t sure either. At the same time, the top 10 pharmaceutical companies on Earth are all holding emergency meetings.</p>
<p>Some companies have urgently halted their anti-cancer drug research and development projects. Some began contacting relevant departments in the Great Sydom, hoping to secure drug distribution rights. They, who once monopolized the global anti-cancer drug market, are now like ants on a hot pan, panicking and disorganized. Let&#x27;s return our attention to the live broadcast. Time passed second by second.</p>
<p>9:30. New test results are in. Academician Jang excitedly announced to the live broadcast camera. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now announcing 20 minutes of monitoring data. Among 100 patients, the activity of cancer cells decreased by an average of 50%.</p>
<p>Among them, 47 patients saw a decrease of more than 60%. The words had barely left his mouth. Cheers erupted again in the observation room. Great, it&#x27;s already down by 50%, we&#x27;re one step closer to eliminating it completely. It&#x27;ll be soon.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same as our experiments, and it will only get faster and faster from here on out. That&#x27;s right. We&#x27;re sure to succeed this time. All the engineers were full of confidence. Lie Jian Guo looked at the latest results, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, this is simply a miracle in medical history. Lynchin smiled and nodded, feeling a little excited as well. At this point, it can be basically confirmed that the clinical trials of the cancer specific drug have been successful. He looked at the big screen. The nurse is carefully measuring the patients vital signs.</p>
<p>An elderly man who was just sweating profusely from the pain was now able to speak softly. Girl, I feel much better. The pain in my chest is gone. The nurse smiled and nodded, her eyes glistening with tears of emotion. Don&#x27;t worry, sir.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll recover soon. The other patients complexions also improved. The pain he had shown before was gone. Instead, they all wore relaxed and comfortable expressions. Although her face was still a bit pale, but these are all normal states of recovery from serious illness.</p>
<p>With proper care and recuperation, you can gradually return to normal. Lie Jian Guo watched the patients gradually easing expressions on the screen and tears welled up in his eyes with emotion. He turned to look at Lin Shun and uttered a heartfelt sigh. Kobayashi, &quot;You really saved countless lives this time.&quot; Lyn Shin humbly replied, &quot;As long as it allows ordinary people to live a better life, then it&#x27;s all worth it.&quot; Upon hearing this, Li Jang Guoo was at a loss for words to describe Lynch. From beginning to end, they have always been thinking about ordinary people.</p>
<p>He thinks of ordinary people when it comes to almost every technology. This kind of mindset is something even he couldn&#x27;t achieve. He felt extremely fortunate that Lynshin was born in the great Sea Kingdom. An hour later, academician Jang stood before the camera, his voice solemn and excited. Ladies and gentlemen, I have some big news to announce.</p>
<p>After monitoring, the cancer cells in the bodies of 100 patients have all disappeared. I hereby announced that the clinical trial has been a complete success. The words had barely left his mouth. The observation room instantly erupted in excitement. The engineers cheered and hugged each other, some even jumping up in excitement.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo held Lynch&#x27;s hand tightly, choking back tears as he said, &quot;Kobayashi, we did it. We really did it.&quot; Looking at the patients happy smiles on the screen, Lynchin nodded and said, &quot;Oldly, this is all thanks to us.&quot; Lie Jian Guo walked over and patted him on the shoulder. Kobayashi, what are your plans next? Lynchan smiled and said softly, &quot;Mr. Lee, cancer specific drugs are just the beginning. Next, we should begin construction of the lunar base.</p>
<p>Chapter 147, the great Xia Kingdom is the light of humanity.&quot; Upon hearing this, Li Jang Wos eyes lit up immediately. Shaolin, do you mean the technical plan for the lunar base has already been written? That&#x27;s right. Great. Let&#x27;s go back now. Lie Jian Guo said eagerly.</p>
<p>The cancer specific drug has been successfully developed. They no longer need to keep watch here. Lynch nodded and then he and Lie Jian Guo left first to return to the Seyaku Academy. At the same time, the CCTV live broadcast room has completely exploded. The number of online users immediately exceeded 500 million.</p>
<p>The barrage of comments was dense and overwhelming. It was utterly insane. Holy crap. They cleared out all the cancer cells in just 1 hour. That&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>I cried. My grandfather also had latestage lung cancer, but now there&#x27;s finally hope. The great SEA Kingdom is awesome. This is a true medical miracle. Thank you, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the researchers. You are the saviors of humanity. The comments were scrolling by faster than lightning. The screen was filled with comments like great Sia Kingdom is awesome and Sia Academy of Sciences is awesome. Fortunately, they didn&#x27;t know Lin Shen&#x27;s identity.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Lin Shan would have already become the national male god of the great Sia Kingdom. Many people started recording videos and sharing them along with their own captions. My mom has been waiting for this day for 3 years. The doctor said she had at most 3 months to live, but now now she can be safe. Some people even posted photos of their family members medical records.</p>
<p>My dad has latestage stomach cancer and has already lost weight down to 80 pounds. We&#x27;re going to apply for treatment tomorrow. On the other side, in the patients family area, looking at his father&#x27;s relaxed brow on the screen, Chunwa burst into tears of joy, his voice choked with emotion. Dad, soon we can go to Tienaman Square to watch the flag raising ceremony. His wife held his hand tightly, tears welling up in her eyes.</p>
<p>The fact that Grandpa Chun was cured is the greatest blessing for their family. Beside the mother, holding her child tightly in her arms, said in a choked voice, &quot;Baby, look, daddy will be home soon. We won&#x27;t have to go to the hospital anymore.&quot; The child clapped his hands, seemingly understanding, and shouted, &quot;Daddy, let&#x27;s go home. Daddy, don&#x27;t go to the hospital.&quot; The other patients families hugged each other, their cries of joy and laughter mingling together. 100 cancer patients had been cured spread like wildfire throughout the great Sea Kingdom in a short time.</p>
<p>In a hospital in a remote mountainous area, a girl in a worn out school uniform watching a live stream on a nurse&#x27;s phone suddenly rushed into the ward. Grandma, Grandma, your illness can be cured. The country has a cure for cancer. The old man on the hospital bed opened his eyes wide and gripped the girl tightly with his withered hands. Really? Really? The nurse smiled and nodded, tears welling in her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s true. Our country has developed a miracle drug, and it will be widely available soon.&quot; The old man suddenly burst into tears, looking at the little girl and murmuring, &quot;Good, good. I&#x27;ve seen you get into university.&quot; Similar situations occurred throughout the entire Great Sea Kingdom. Many cancer patients were so moved that they cried. They finally saw hope for survival.</p>
<p>Many patients who were originally diagnosed with cancer felt like the sky had fallen. They are filled with despair for the future. But at this moment, their hope was rekindled. I am full of hope for being alive. Now they are hoping to massproduce and popularize it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the same time, I am trying to adjust my mindset and strive to live to see the day when effective cancer drugs become widely available. On the international internet, comments from overseas nizens flooded the screen. My god, the great SEA Kingdom actually did it. Is this magic? We beg the great Sea Kingdom to start mass production quickly. We&#x27;re willing to pay any price.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom is the true light of humanity. That&#x27;s right. Tens of millions of cancer patients worldwide finally have hope, especially cancer patients internationally. At this moment, they are all posting their prayers on various social media platforms. We hope that the great SIA kingdom can promote the effective medicine to the world as soon as possible so that they can also grasp this lifeline no matter how much they hated the great SIA kingdom before.</p>
<p>But at this moment, they all gave a thumbs up to the great SIA kingdom. At the same time, Merc Ltd, the conference room was deathly silent. Davis watched the live stream, his face deathly pale. Impossible. This is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>We spent 20 years and invested hundreds of billions of dollars and still couldn&#x27;t achieve this. How could they do it so quickly? Kenneth slumped into his chair, his face deathly pale. It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s all over. In the conference room, everyone was utterly desperate.</p>
<p>The cancer fighting drugs of the great Sa Kingdom are incredibly effective. Who would still buy their cancer treatment drugs? Just then, the assistant rushed in. It&#x27;s terrible. The company&#x27;s stock price has plummeted and hit the daily limit down. Branch offices worldwide are receiving return requests.</p>
<p>Davis slumped into his chair, muttering to himself. It&#x27;s really over. He is now filled with regret. In fact, the cancer treatment drugs developed by their company are already very effective. But in order to make money, they dilute the medication and reduce its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Now, they&#x27;re finally reaping the consequences. It&#x27;s not just Merc. The stock markets of major pharmaceutical companies worldwide have all collapsed. The entire international pharmaceutical industry suffered a devastating blow in the world&#x27;s richest circles. But it sparked another wave of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>They tried every possible method and channel. Their sole purpose was to purchase the cancer specific drug from the great sea kingdom. Even if they don&#x27;t have cancer now, they still want to buy it just in case. Inside the US president&#x27;s office, looking at the report on the table, Opton angrily smashed his cup on the floor. Useless.</p>
<p>All of you are useless. Why can our great SIA kingdom develop a cure for cancer? But we can&#x27;t when we have so many pharmaceutical companies. Secretary of State Raymond, his face grim, replied, &quot;Mr. President, those pharmaceutical companies are capitalists. They only care about profits.&quot; Optin fell silent instantly.</p>
<p>He certainly understood what Ramundu meant. After all, he was originally a small capitalist. In particular, he also used his power to reap considerable benefits for his companies. However, Optton also wanted to possess the cancer fighting drug that was effective in the Great Sa Kingdom. Lay Ming Duo, find a way to contact the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>No matter what method we use, we must get some cancer specific drugs from them. Lay Ming Duo was stunned for a moment, then understood. President, please rest assured. I will do my best to handle this matter and obtain the special medicine at all costs. Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>Optin waved his hand. At the same time, inside the prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan, sitting in his dimly lit office, Kishid Jiro witnessed another breakthrough for the great Sia Kingdom. His face immediately turned extremely pale. Baka, why is it the Great Sa Kingdom again? Why is it that our Japan with its cherry blossoms is having such a difficult time while they keep making breakthroughs? Suddenly, he thought of something and instantly became anxious. If their effective drug can clear cancer cells, will it also clear our T- virus? He immediately called Dr.</p>
<p>Kawashima. Dr. Kawashima, here&#x27;s what happened. On the other end of the phone, Dr. Kawashima listened for a few seconds, then confidently said, &quot;Prime Minister, please rest assured.</p>
<p>Our T- virus is absolutely incurable in this world. With the so-called cancer cures of the great Sia Kingdom, they certainly can&#x27;t eliminate our T- virus.&quot; Upon hearing this, Kishidurro immediately breathed a sigh of relief. That&#x27;s good. By the way, when will the T- virus stabilize and be mass-produced? Two more months. Speed up.</p>
<p>Okay. The call ended. Kishaurro&#x27;s eyes were filled with ruthlessness. Great Sia Kingdom. In 2 months, it will be your end.</p>
<p>Chapter 148. The Guanghan Palace. Project established. Siaki Yuan. Li Jang Wos office.</p>
<p>Lynchin projected a 3D model of the lunar base onto a large screen. A silver gray domed building is embedded in the surface of the moon. A blue energy shield enveloped the living area and mining trucks shuttled between the craters. Mr. Lee, the Guang Han Palace base will be constructed in two phases.</p>
<p>The first phase will build an energy station and a temporary living area powered by controlled nuclear fusion. Lin Shan pointed to the spherical device in the corner of the model. The second phase involves laying helium, three refining pipelines, and constructing related mining farms for refining. Lie Jang Wos eyes were full of excitement. Shaolin, according to your plan, how long will it take to complete the construction of the Guanghan Palace Base? 3 to 6 months.</p>
<p>The length of time depends on how much manpower is invested in the construction. Lynch stated time frame is rather conservative. If all efforts are put into its development, the Kuening space plane will be sufficient. It is estimated that the Guang Han Palace base can be completed in less than 3 months. Of course, it only allows people to live a normal life and conduct scientific research activities on it.</p>
<p>Based on this, we will then begin to improve other functions. For example, lunar planting or lunar factories. 6 months is enough. Liian Guo was shocked. That&#x27;s a lunar base.</p>
<p>It can be built in just 6 months. That&#x27;s outrageous. However, considering that the Great Sa Kingdom is known as the infrastructure maniac, this should be able to be completed within this time frame. Okay, I&#x27;ll go and convene a project initiation meeting with the relevant personnel right away. Lie Jian Guo no longer hesitated.</p>
<p>He had already reported this project to his superiors and received approval. As long as Lyn Shun presents the technical solution, he can directly contact Liang. One day later, the largest conference room at the Xiaku Academy was packed with people. It can be said that this was the largest conference in the history of the Syaku Academy. The experts andmissians involved are among those involved.</p>
<p>It covers a wide range of fields including aerospace engineering, energy technology, material science, and biological science. There are many familiar faces in it. They are all technical experts who have attended Lin Chin&#x27;s technology launch event. Their eyes were filled with excitement and anticipation. Only the experts and professors attending the conference for the first time looked completely bewildered.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on? Why are they so excited? Can anyone tell me what kind of meeting this is? With so many industries participating, is it to evaluate candidates for academic? Looking at the suspicions of those people, those around who knew the truth smiled mysteriously. Then it&#x27;s the same familiar formula. A staff member came in with a confidentiality agreement. It wasn&#x27;t until this moment that those who were attending the meeting for the first time roughly understood what was going on. The confidentiality agreement has been signed.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo led Lin Shun into the conference room. Moment. The entire conference room erupted in excitement. Huh? I knew it was Chief Engineer Lin. Hey old Joe, remember you owe me a pack of Long Jing T.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s here. That familiar man is here again. The experts and missians who had participated in Linshins technology project approval meeting were all very excited. Those attending for the first time were still completely bewildered. Lie Jian Guo and the others knew him, but they didn&#x27;t know Lin Chun.</p>
<p>He heard people around him calling out to Chief Engineer Lynn. Could that young man be the chief engineer of some project? This is a bit outrageous. No wonder they had to sign a top secret confidentiality agreement. It seems to be a hidden genius in our country. Their ability to attend this kind of meeting is based on background checks.</p>
<p>There won&#x27;t be anyone with a spy identity. Especially a few months ago, there was a major cleaning. Almost all the foreign spies within the territory of the great Sia Kingdom were wiped out. While those people were wondering, Li Jang Guo stood on the podium, cleared his throat, and began. Everyone, the main reason for calling this meeting is to discuss the project approval for the Guang Han Palace Base.</p>
<p>This meeting will be chaired by Comrade Lin Chun. After Lie Jian Guo finished speaking, he invited Linshin to the stage and then briefly introduced Lin Chen&#x27;s identity. When those attending the meeting for the first time heard Lin Chen&#x27;s identity, my head was buzzing. Chief designer of the Bitey aerospace fighter, chief designer of the Kuaning space plane, chief technician of cancer specific drugs, chief designer of controlled nuclear fusion. Each identity shocked them so much that their skulls almost flew off.</p>
<p>When did the country acquire such a terrifyingly prodigy? Is this defying the heavens? He&#x27;s so young. Compared to Chief Engineer Lynn, I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted the last few decades of my life. All the technical experts who were meeting Lynn Shan for the first time. They were all stunned by Lynch&#x27;s series of dazzling identities. The experts around who were familiar with Lynch couldn&#x27;t help but chuckle at the reactions of those people.</p>
<p>After all, didn&#x27;t they go through the same thing back then? The experts were stunned. Lyn Shan had already walked to the podium, smiling and humbly greeting everyone. Hello everyone, my name is Lin Shun. Next, I will explain the technical solutions for the Guang Han Palace Base to you. As he spoke, he projected the technical solution for the Guang Han Palace Base onto the large screen.</p>
<p>Then the explanation began. Moment in the conference room, experts and missians from various fields focused their attention on the large screen. As Lynchin continued to explain, their expressions began to change constantly. using lunar soil to 3D print buildings. That technology is incredibly advanced.</p>
<p>Can we still live normally on the moon? Have we completely overcome the effects of gravity? And this lunar mining machine is actually unmanned. Experts from various fields were deeply impressed by the techniques explained by Lyn Shun. Those technologies are ones that humanity is currently unable to overcome. But for Lyn Shun, it seems so easy, especially when talking about the lunar plantation ecological park. Biologist academician Jang was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Can vegetables be grown on the moon? A plant oxygen supply system. Not only can it grow crops, but it can also purify water through recycling. These were all just ideas proposed by scientists before. Unexpectedly, Lynchin actually succeeded, especially when the topic of backup energy equipment comes up later. Experts in the field of solar energy were completely stunned.</p>
<p>70% solar energy conversion rate. How is that possible? That&#x27;s absolutely outrageous. If we can really do that, our great Sia Kingdom will never lack energy again. Almost every time Lynchin talked about a technology, various exclamations of awe and wonder emanated from below. Until Lynch and finished explaining everything, the experts and academy missions below still seem to want more.</p>
<p>If all these technologies can be realized, we can eventually colonize Mars. Yes, such advanced technology is simply outrageous. It&#x27;s so sci-fi. I feel like I&#x27;ve wandered onto the wrong set. The experts andmissians were filled with emotion.</p>
<p>The solution proposed by Lin Shun was far beyond their level of understanding. There are even some technologies that they have never even heard of. A moment later, Lie Jian Guo walked to the podium, clapped his hands, and the whole room fell silent. It is now announced that the Guang Han Palace Base project has been officially approved. Lynn Shan is appointed as the chief engineer of the project with full authority over the construction of the base.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, applause erupted. Everyone expressed their support. The Guang Han Palace Base project was officially established. This signifies that the Great Sa Kingdom has officially entered the era of space development. Chapter 149 Starship delivered.</p>
<p>Lynch once again entered a routine of going back and forth between two points. During the day, I wander around various laboratories. In the evening, I receive the inheritance in the inheritance space. The Guanghan Palace Base project includes various sub projects. It cannot be completed in a short time.</p>
<p>But Lynchin still wanted to complete the inheritance as soon as possible and then start the space city project. While the Guanghan Palace Base project was in full swing, the Great Sa Kingdom is once again facing another major event. The first batch of 10,000 star cars has begun delivery. The capital city, starry sky roller plaza. Seven colored star-shaped flying cars are neatly arranged.</p>
<p>The streamlined body has a futuristic feel. The entire delivery process was broadcast live. The number of viewers watching CCTV&#x27;s live broadcast instantly surpassed 800 million. The barrage of comments scrolled like a tide. W I&#x27;m so envious of the first batch of car owners.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m over 10 millionth in line. How long will I have to wait? The first batch only has 10,000 vehicles. When will they all be delivered? I heard that the orders have already exceeded 100 million. Even if it&#x27;s 10,000 vehicles a day, it will still take more than 10,000 days. I heard that all the car manufacturers in the country are converting their production capacity into flying car production lines.</p>
<p>So, they&#x27;ll probably be able to increase production capacity soon. I hope so. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t know how long I&#x27;ll have to wait. Everyone envied the first batch of car owners. At the same time, there are concerns about delivery issues.</p>
<p>If only 10,000 vehicles are produced per day, it would take decades to deliver them domestically. Not to mention the massive orders from overseas. But what if all the car factories in the great Sea Kingdom switched to producing flying cars? It can produce at least 50 million vehicles a year. It can be delivered in 2 years. While the audience was in a frenzy, the delivery ceremony officially began.</p>
<p>The first group of car owners who arrived at the scene stepped forward one by one. The moment they got the car keys, someone jumped up. Holy crap, this key is holographic. A programmer wearing glasses had trembling hands. He showed the key to the camera.</p>
<p>Press the button and a 3D model of the flying car appears in the air. It contains all the information about the car, including his personal information. Other early adopters also started showing off their cars. The viewers in the live stream were filled with envy, jealousy, and resentment. They wish they could just steal those people&#x27;s flying cars.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a pity. All racing games are linked to personal ID information. Even if others manage to steal it, they won&#x27;t be able to use it. They might even be taken directly to the police station by the starship. After the car owner received the Starry Sky flying car, they all began their first experience.</p>
<p>After setting the navigation, I started flying all over the country. During this period, the air traffic control bureau also specially planned airspace for flying vehicles. At the same time, all flying vehicles are intelligently controlled and scheduled. Pingching, a newlywed couple, Shunyang and Su Xiao, were among the first owners of the starry sky flying car. They were circling around the starship.</p>
<p>Su Xiao touched the car body, her eyes sparkling. Honey, is this our starship? It&#x27;s so beautiful, Chinyong said excitedly. Come on, wife. Let&#x27;s drive back to our hometown right now. Okay, let&#x27;s go back to our hometown and show our parents our new car.</p>
<p>Su Xiao got into the driver&#x27;s seat and Chinyong sat in the passenger seat. The voice control system responded immediately. Hello, driver. Going back to my hometown, Suja Town. Okay, navigation connected.</p>
<p>Destination: Suja Town, my hometown. The flying car slowly ascended into the air. Su Xiao couldn&#x27;t help but scream. Uh, it really flew. There wasn&#x27;t a single bump.</p>
<p>Chenyong smiled and wiped the smile from the corner of her mouth. Don&#x27;t get excited. Well be home in half an hour. before they need to take the high-speed rail and then transfer to a bus to get back to their hometown. It takes a whole day to get there.</p>
<p>Now the car flew smoothly through the clouds. The village below gradually came into view. Sushia dialed her mother&#x27;s video call. Mom, look. We&#x27;re almost home.</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, Sue&#x27;s mother looked at the clouds and flying cars on the screen. Her eyes instantly welled up with tears. Girl, did you come back by plane? No. Mom, this is the starry sky roller coaster we bought. Su Shiao turned the camera towards the driver&#x27;s seat.</p>
<p>We are now over our village. Su&#x27;s mother hurriedly ran into the yard. Looking up, I saw a silver white flying car in the sky. The neighbors also gathered around. Old Sue&#x27;s family.</p>
<p>Is that your daughter? Who&#x27;s back? This is the starship. It really can fly in the sky. Su Xiao ordered the flying car to slowly descend. It was parked in the open space in the yard. Su&#x27;s mother held her daughter&#x27;s hand and touched the body of the flying car.</p>
<p>This thing must have cost a lot of money, right? Chinyong smiled and handed over the fruit. Mom, the government provided subsidies, so it didn&#x27;t cost much, only 50,000 yuan. He bought the budget version of the racing game. It was because they were newly weds that they were included in the priority delivery policy. That&#x27;s how you get to the flying car so quickly.</p>
<p>Then the family sat together in the yard. Laughter and cheerful voices drifted far away. The neighbors were all envious and urged their children to buy Starship roller coaster as soon as possible. On the internet, post from a wealthy person has gone viral. Looking to rent a Stardust Rover for one day.</p>
<p>Price: 100,000. I&#x27;ll pay 200,000. Just take me flying once. Any car owners willing to be my tour guide? I&#x27;ll cover all meals and accommodation. A rich kid posted a video directly.</p>
<p>Whoever lets me experience it just once. I&#x27;ll immediately transfer 500,000 yuan. In the comments section, the first batch of car owners made jokes. Excuse me, I&#x27;m taking my parents on a trip around the country. I&#x27;ve already booked a trip to Tibet next month.</p>
<p>Want to try it out? Wait for the next delivery. At the same time, across the globe, it&#x27;s all Starship trooper videos. European nizens launched a petition directly. We strongly demand that the great SIA kingdom export the Starship. We&#x27;re willing to pay three times the price.</p>
<p>No, we&#x27;re willing to pay 10 times the price. They have been completely conquered by Starship. They are willing to buy it no matter how high the price. The desert dwelling rich countries are even more extravagant. Seeing that Starship had started delivering cars, they began urging them to release their customized version.</p>
<p>Distributors in other regions also started going crazy. American dealers can directly contact Stardust Motors and place an order for 1 million vehicles with full payment possible. European dealers went even further, sending a private plane to deliver contracts for the purchase of 500,000 vehicles. Almost all distributors are placing orders like crazy. Moreover, they indicated that all payments could be made in full, but all of them were rejected by Shingshin Technology.</p>
<p>The gaps within the Great Sa Kingdom are already so large. I definitely won&#x27;t consider overseas options for the time being. At the very least, there will be a small amount of exports only after the great SEA Kingdom has delivered most of the goods. The White House of the US Optin felt a pang of sadness as he watched the awe inspiring scene of the first batch of Starship vehicles delivered to the great sea kingdom. If only Stardust Mars belonged to the US.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s something I can only think about in my mind. President, the Great Sea Kingdom has now dominated all the high-tech fields. If this continues, even if the Great Sea Kingdom doesn&#x27;t attack us, our country will go bankrupt. Lay Mang Duo was filled with worry. The US already owes nearly 40 trillion US in foreign debt.</p>
<p>In the past, they could use high-tech industries as the economic pillar to repay their debts and keep the country running. But now, their high-tech industries have all been destroyed by the Great Sea Kingdom. Continue at this pace. If they don&#x27;t find new pillar industries, the US will soon go bankrupt. Upon hearing this, Optton fell silent.</p>
<p>He also understood the seriousness of the situation. However, there is no good solution. Research and development investment has been increased. Breakthroughs are also being made in quantum chip technology, but catching up with the level of the great SEA kingdom is extremely difficult. The only hope now lies in the space industry.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Powen said firmly, &quot;No, we also have the space industry.&quot; As long as we can successfully land on the moon and develop its resources, then all crises will be resolved. Raymond was not optimistic and continued to persuade him. Mr. President, the starship&#x27;s manned lunar landing has not yet been successfully tested. Optin interrupted him directly.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t need to say anything more. The first time was because of India. This time we will definitely succeed. Truth has said that we can send people to the moon again in 2 weeks. Go and issue a public announcement right now.</p>
<p>So the whole world can see that our American Eagle is about to make a glorious return. Chapter 150. Worldwide ridicule. Seeing that Optton was so determined, Rayondo stopped trying to persuade him. She turned and left to post the announcement.</p>
<p>The announcement immediately caused an uproar among the American public. Streets of New York. Starship s second man lunar landing was played on a loop on the large screen. In 2 weeks, our astronauts will set foot on the moon. This time, no one can stop us.</p>
<p>Passers by stopped and began to get excited and excited. Is a man moon landing finally coming? I hope it&#x27;s a success. Without India interfering this time, we will definitely succeed. European countries have gathered together for joint research and development. It&#x27;s bound to succeed.</p>
<p>As long as we can successfully land people on the moon, the great kingdom will no longer be able to monopolize the moon&#x27;s resources. Many American nizens are full of anticipation especially after they learned that the US had gathered all the world&#x27;s aerospace scientists except for those from China and India to participate in the research and development. They are full of confidence. They firmly believe that they would succeed this time. The great SEA kingdom is powerful.</p>
<p>They have already acknowledged it. But they will not give up. They will strive to catch up. One day we will catch up with the great Sia Kingdom. At the same time, nizens from allied countries, including the United States, also joined in the discussion.</p>
<p>Yoshi, our American daddy, is finally going to send people to the moon. Amitarasu will surely bless you with success. After the US succeeds, if Great Sa wants to monopolize the lunar resources, it will have to ask our US-led alliance whether they agree. That&#x27;s right. As long as the US successfully lands on the moon, it means that our entire US alliance has succeeded.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Our Eagle Alliance is one entity. People in those countries knew that it was impossible for them to land a man on the moon alone. They wanted to use this method to align themselves with the US. This was to achieve the goal of restraining the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>In other countries on Earth were completely different. I suggest preparing a speech in advance about the technical malfunction to avoid being caught off guard. I bet this time it will be postponed on the grounds of excessive radiation in space. Do you believe it? No. Optin will definitely say it&#x27;s because of the inferior fuel used.</p>
<p>Huh? Yes, that&#x27;s the taste. Almost every other country on Earth started mocking them. They don&#x27;t think the US will succeed this time. If it&#x27;s just a test flight of the Starship, it might be successful. But do we want to go to the moon? Easier said than done.</p>
<p>Netzens in the great sea kingdom in particular have started watching the drama unfold. On Weibo, the topic of speculating about the US moon landing quickly went viral. I bet 5 cents something unexpected will definitely happen this time. Last time you made up an excuse that India was stirring things up, but this time you&#x27;ve brought together scientists from so many countries. What excuse are you coming up with? Do you think they might get lost on the moon and need our navigation? Hara, the person upstairs is right.</p>
<p>I suggest they download the star navigation app in advance. On a certain video platform, content creators are making prediction videos. Historically, the failure rate of the US moon landing program is as high as 60%. The Starship technology used this time is yet another of Musk&#x27;s new technologies with a zero probability of success. In the comment section, Netzens made a lot of jokes.</p>
<p>Starships compared to our Kuing space plane, they&#x27;re just garbage. I suggest that the US stop its efforts and just buy our space tourism package. It will save time and effort. Exactly. Why waste that money? You might as well use it to buy a starship.</p>
<p>Once our moon palace base is completed, we welcome American astronauts to visit NASA Space Agency. Trudeau frowned as he looked at the sudden announcement from the White House. What exactly does the president want to do? The twoe test flight is just an estimated time frame. Can&#x27;t we be given enough time to prepare? He pinched the bridge of his nose, looking utterly helpless. Originally, they only wanted to test the performance of the Starship rocket.</p>
<p>We haven&#x27;t reached the point of man lunar landing yet. Now the White House is issuing a direct statement. Even if they don&#x27;t want to, they&#x27;re forced into it. Fortunately, everything else went relatively smoothly. It involves finding astronauts on short notice and planning the specific operations after the moon landing.</p>
<p>These can all be learned from the experience of the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s Kuing space plane and then simply copied. Then Trudeau instructed all the scientists to make a final push. As for the astronauts, let optin deal with that headache. The great SIA kingdom, SIA Academy of Sciences. Lynn Shan expressed his satisfaction after reviewing the first batch of Starship flying cars delivered.</p>
<p>Excellent. The Star Chariot is performing better than expected. He could tell from the comments online. Those who received the first batch of flying cars were filled with longing for a better life. No longer the same mindset I had before, even if they are very tired from work.</p>
<p>The thought of going home to see my children and family after get off work fills me with happiness, especially under the new policies now. Their life stress vanished instantly. In addition, there is now free medical care. They are already very satisfied. While Lynchin was pondering, Lie Jian Guo pushed open the door and came in, his expression somewhat serious.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, have you seen the US announcement? An announcement from the US? What kind of trouble are they up to now? Lynchin had been keeping an eye on Star Sky Racing. Lie Jang Wos alliance explained, &quot;The US is preparing to send a manned lunar mission in half a month.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; Lynchin gave a dismissive, &quot;Oh, oldly, you don&#x27;t need to worry. The US will never be able to land on the moon.&quot; Joke. There are starstones on the moon. How could we possibly let the US go up there? Even if they had the capability, he would still have to find a way to make the US moon landing fail.</p>
<p>Anyway, the resources on the moon belong solely to the Great Sea Kingdom. No one is allowed to touch it. Seeing Lynch&#x27;s reaction, Li Jang Wos eyes lit up. Little Lynn, could it be that you want to? Lynch smiled mysteriously and did not answer. But Lie Jian Guo understood instantly.</p>
<p>Wasn&#x27;t this the same expression Lynn Shun had when he first tested the super laser cannon. At that time, the US lost several satellites and a global hawk drone. Later, the White House&#x27;s space fighter jets made their maiden flight and destroyed thousands of Starlink satellites belonging to the United States. even destroyed the Yasakuni ghost toilet in Japan. Lynchin always wore this smile before he started anything.</p>
<p>This time, the US is probably going to be in trouble again, even if they managed to reach the moon. The final result was the same. The moon landing failed. Lie Jian Guo silently mourned for the American astronauts for 0.1 seconds. Then, Lynchin talked to Li Jian Guo about the Guanghan Palace base.</p>
<p>As for the US, sending a man moon landing, Lynchin didn&#x27;t care at all. He now wants to build the Guanghan Palace as soon as possible. After the base is built, he can also go to the moon to take a look. Chapter 151. Super 3D building printer.</p>
<p>3 days after the announcement of the US manned lunar landing materials laboratory of the Siaku Institute. A super 3D architectural printer, its entire body gleaming with a futuristic metallic sheen stands tall on the laboratory testing platform. Chief engineer Lynn. This is the super 3D building printer built according to the design plan. Academician Zhao introduced the topic with great excitement.</p>
<p>The engineers around him were filled with pride. It has only been a few days since the project was launched. The key equipment for the construction of the Guanhan Palace Base, the super 3D building printer completed the design. It can directly use lunar soil as raw material, add a newly developed high strength polymer, and directly create super strong buildings that can withstand a category 18 typhoon in a magnitude 10 earthquake. Lynshan looked at the super 3D building printer in front of him and nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Great job. You&#x27;ve all worked hard. Chief Engineer Lynn, we didn&#x27;t work hard at all. Academicianha quickly waved his hand. Without Chief Engineer Lynn&#x27;s technical solutions and guidance, we simply couldn&#x27;t have developed such advanced cuttingedge technology products.</p>
<p>The surrounding engineers nodded in agreement. Lynn Shun waved his hand, changing the subject. All right, let&#x27;s stop flattering each other. Let&#x27;s start testing the performance of this super 3D architectural printer. Okay, chief engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>Academician Joe nodded. Let&#x27;s begin the simulation test now. He turned to the relevant engineer and gave the instructions. Initiate the first level stress test. First simulating the printing of the outer wall module of the lunar base.</p>
<p>Receive. The engineer responded enthusiastically. Then start adding raw materials and add a certain proportion of high strength polymerizing agent. After confirming that everything is correct, press the start button. The printer nozzle sprayed out silver gray ink.</p>
<p>It solidified instantly into a dense plate. Detect module density. report density 280g/ cm superscript 3 compressive strength over 8,000 MPa more than 100 times that of the strongest concrete. All test parameters have been reported. Cheers erupted throughout the laboratory.</p>
<p>Outrageous. This intensity is beyond belief. Even a magnitude 10 earthquake or a category 18 typhoon would have no effect on it. It can even withstand the bombardment of mushroom bombs. Yes, it will definitely be the best building material when used in infrastructure projects across the country.</p>
<p>This strength far surpasses that of any building material on Earth. A lunar base built with it would be absolutely super safe. Even if someone tries to sabotage the bombing, it won&#x27;t have any impact. Chief engineer Lynn, we succeeded. Academicianha was so excited that he was trembling.</p>
<p>He is a national level academician in the field of building materials. He has an excellent understanding of all building materials. However, the strength of the materials printed by this super 3D building printer was far beyond his comprehension. He knew that this material would be invaluable once it was used in the construction of a lunar base. There will be absolutely no problem with the strength of the lunar base.</p>
<p>It can even be widely promoted in the great sea kingdom. This is especially true for coastal cities and cities near earthquake zones. It frequently suffers from natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes. If you use a super 3D building printer to build a house, the losses caused by natural disasters will be reduced indefinitely. It has immeasurable benefits for both the people and the country.</p>
<p>Seeing the excited expressions on everyone&#x27;s faces, Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;This is just the initial test. Let&#x27;s continue testing other aspects of its performance. The performance of the super 3D architectural printer is the result of multiple optimizations at the Heritage Space Laboratory. He is still very confident about this. Testing continues.</p>
<p>5 hours later, a complete scaledown model of the lunar base stands in the center of the test site. The silver gray exterior has a metallic sheen, giving it a futuristic look. Chief engineer Lynn, all tests have been passed. A super 3D printer that perfectly meets the needs of lunar construction. academician Joe&#x27;s voice was filled with excitement.</p>
<p>The other engineers were so excited they were numb to be able to personally participate in and witness the birth of such a powerful cuttingedge technology product. It was the most shining moment of their careers. During this time, they also learned a lot of knowledge that they had never encountered before. This will greatly enhance their research capabilities and broaden their horizons. This is their greatest and most valuable asset.</p>
<p>The test of the super 3D building printer has been completed. Lynn Shun was very satisfied and gave the following instructions again. Continue with the current plan and assemble 10 super 3D building printers within 5 days. Send it to the moon for testing in 5 days. At the same time, we will perfect all the mass production process specifications and start mass production immediately after the successful testing on the moon.</p>
<p>Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn Academician Zhao and a group of engineers responded excitedly. At the same time, they are very confident that they can assemble another nine super 3D building printers in 5 days. Once the first one is assembled, the rest will become very easy. Lynshin gave a few more instructions, then left the lab and headed to Li Jang Wos office. Li Jang Wos office.</p>
<p>Lynch gave a brief report on the test results of the super 3D building printer. Upon hearing this, Li Jian Guo was immediately shocked. Shaolin, is he really as strong as you say? Lynchin nodded slightly. This is amazing, Liian Guo exclaimed excitedly. This is absolutely a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of architecture.</p>
<p>3D building printers are not a rarity. Currently, many countries on Earth are using it. However, due to issues of strength and construction difficulty, it was only used on a small scale as an experiment. It has not achieved widespread use. But today&#x27;s super 3D architectural printers are different.</p>
<p>They can be widely deployed directly. It could even directly replace most current building materials. The thought of the changes it might bring to the great Sia Kingdom filled Li Jian Guo with excitement. Lynchin smiled and continued, &quot;Mr. Lee, I plan to go to the moon in 5 days to conduct a field test of the performance of the super 3D building printer.&quot; At the same time, the construction of the Guang Han Palace base has officially begun.</p>
<p>He always kept thinking about the stars on the moon. The sooner it&#x27;s developed, the sooner we can have peace of mind. The main component is star stone which will play a significant role in the future interstellar navigation of the great Sia kingdom. It must be developed as soon as possible. All right, Lie Jian Guo agreed without hesitation.</p>
<p>Then let&#x27;s officially begin construction of the Guanghan Palace base in 5 days. During this period, the Kuing space plane has officially entered mass production. Furthermore, controlled nuclear fusion devices have also begun mass production. Meanwhile, special construction personnel for lunar landing are also undergoing emergency training. During this period, the Kuaning space plane also made multiple trips to and from the moon.</p>
<p>The optimal location for Guanghan Palace Base number one has been determined. This is the moment we&#x27;ve been waiting for. Next, Lynshin discussed the specific details with Li Jian Guo. Then, 5 days later, they would begin the lunar landing and construction of the Moon Palace Base 1. This time we chose to proceed in secret.</p>
<p>Lynn Shun is preparing a big surprise for the US&#x27;s manned lunar landing mission. Chapter 152 Guanghan Palace Base number one. Day five. Kuing space shuttle base. It was originally an air force base.</p>
<p>It was specially set aside for the Kuing Space plane. 10 Kuaning space planes are neatly arranged on the launchpad. One super 3D printer has been installed. 50 engineers and 10 drivers dressed in white space suits stood in a line. Lie Jian Guo stood in front of them, his face serious.</p>
<p>Comrades, today you are about to embark on the first great feat in human history. You will land on the moon and build humanity&#x27;s first unmanned planetary base. Are you confident you can accomplish this? Mission accomplished. The engineers responded with confidence. Very good.</p>
<p>Boarding will now commence soon. All personnel then boarded 10 kimping space planes. Each kimping space plane can seat six people. The rest is all transportation space and living quarters. This has been modified.</p>
<p>It was specifically designed for use in the early stages of lunar base construction. After making all the preparations, the Kimping space plane has started up. It&#x27;s still the familiar anti-gravity takeoff. After reaching an altitude of 2,000 m, it began to accelerate and fly towards outer space. The 10 coimping space planes quickly disappeared from Li Jang Wos and his team&#x27;s sight.</p>
<p>This is the first time that 10 Kimping space planes have flown to the moon simultaneously. Lin Shun and Li Jang Guo still value it quite a bit. They went directly to the ground control center. Watching the Kimping space plane successfully break through the atmosphere and reach near Earth orbit of the blue planet. Everything went so smoothly.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, it seems everything is going very smoothly. Lie Jian Guo breathed a sigh of relief. Definitely. Lynch nodded confidently. The technology is already very mature.</p>
<p>We need to speed up mass production and also build the space passenger plane as soon as possible. Preparing for the upcoming space and lunar missions. Okay. Lie Jian Guo agreed. Once the lunar base is built, it&#x27;s time for us ordinary people to go up and take a look on the Kimping space plane number one.</p>
<p>The construction workers were filled with excitement. Haha. We&#x27;ve finally flown out of Earth. Yes, Earth is so beautiful. Is the space.</p>
<p>It feels so mysterious. Captain Woo, we&#x27;re so lucky this time to have been selected as the first batch of lunar builders. The person in charge of this lunar base construction is named Wu Gang. His eyes were also filled with excitement. Yes, we must complete this mission well and absolutely cannot let the country down.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, we will definitely succeed. The other engineers were all full of confidence. As for the dangers of landing on the moon, they had long forgotten about it. The moment they were selected, they had already prepared for the worst. Even if something unexpected happens on the moon, they will have no regrets.</p>
<p>6 hours later, the surface of the moon. 10 Kuaning space planes slowly landed at the designated landing coordinates. The moment it touched the lunar surface, the buffer device deployed and firmly fixed itself on the gray soil. Is this the moon? All the engineers were deeply moved. Although I&#x27;ve seen the moon&#x27;s surface in countless videos, but seeing it with my own eyes for the first time was still very shocking.</p>
<p>While they were still in shock, Captain Wu Gang had already begun contacting the ground control center. Report: We have successfully landed on the moon. Excellent. Begin executing the original plan. Received.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished. After Wu Gang ended the call, he began to issue tasks. Release the Super 3D building printer. All personnel to the landing module prepared to execute the plan. The engineers acted swiftly.</p>
<p>Based on previous training, we arrived at the landing isolation pod and boarded the lunar rover. The lunar rover was then released onto the lunar surface. At the same time, the robotic arm unloads the super 3D building printer from the aircraft and fixes it in the pre-selected area. Then the engineers began to operate the equipment. Printer started positioning system calibration.</p>
<p>Lunar soil collection device is functioning normally. Begin extracting lunar soil. The silver printer started running. Lunar soil extraction successful, initiating automatic addition of polymerizing agent. Construction begins.</p>
<p>The nozzles moved across the lunar surface and the silver gray walls extended upwards at a visible speed. Report. The first exterior wall is complete. 3 m high, 1 m thick. Start printing the support columns.</p>
<p>There is no atmosphere on the moon and the sunlight shines directly on the building modules, giving them a cold, sharp glow. Wu Gang looked at the gradually taking shape base framework, his eyes filled with excitement. We did it. We really have built a base on the moon. Other engineers were also excited.</p>
<p>The performance of the super 3D architectural printer far exceeded their expectations. With 10 machines working simultaneously, the basic framework can be built in just a few minutes. After his initial excitement, Wu Gang began reporting to the ground control center. Report to headquarters. The super 3D architectural printer is working perfectly, even better than expected.</p>
<p>Ground control center. As Lie Jian Guo listened to the report and watched the live feed on the big screen, his eyes were filled with excitement. Very good. You are all excellent. Continue with the mission as planned and be careful.</p>
<p>Receive. After giving his instructions, Lie Jian Guo turned to Lin Shun and said, &quot;Shaolin, we succeeded.&quot; Lynch nodded and smiled at Li Jang Guo, saying, &quot;Not bad. At this pace, the main building can be completed within 5 days.&quot; 5 days. Li Jang Wos eyes widened. That&#x27;s even faster than we expected.</p>
<p>5 days later, Lunar Palace Base 1. The main building is now complete. The entire building is ovalshaped. It was made entirely using lunar soil and a super 3D printer without any steel or cement. The main building covers an area of 10,000 square meters, including energy station, living area, material storage, warehouse, experimental area, and guard area.</p>
<p>Captain Woo, did we really finish this in just 5 days? Someone hit me. Let me see if I&#x27;m dreaming. We completed such a huge building in just 5 days. It feels like a dream. An engineer looked at the Guang Han Palace number one base in front of him with an incredulous expression.</p>
<p>Other engineers had the same reaction. Although they were involved in the entire construction process. When you actually see the final result, I was still deeply shocked. Wu Gang stood at the entrance of the base. His eyes filled with excitement.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. This is the result of our 5 days of hard work. This is our great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s first permanent base on the moon. From now on, the moon will belong to our great Sia kingdom forever. Wu Gangs voice was full of pride.</p>
<p>They were able to be among the first to participate in the construction of humanity&#x27;s first extraterrestrial base. It was definitely the most glorious thing in his life. Even when I&#x27;m old, I can still brag to my descendants about my amazing feats on the moon. Chapter 153. The US sends a manned plane to the moon.</p>
<p>Ground control center. On the big screen, the oval-shaped main building of Guanghan Palace, Base 1, gleams with a cold metallic sheen against the gray lunar soil. Lie Jian Guo stared at the construction vehicle finishing up on the screen, his voice trembling. Shaolin, this is our great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s lunar base. It was really built in just 5 days.</p>
<p>Lynshin smiled, but his eyes never left the screen. He pointed to the blank area in the corner of the screen. The main body is just the beginning. Next, we&#x27;ll prioritize building the living area, the energy system, gravity system, oxygen circulation system, and so on. Will begin installation immediately.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo nodded quickly. I&#x27;ll do whatever you say. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Lynshin moved his finger to the edge of the screen. The defense system needs to keep up. Equip six superpowered laser cannons around the base to automatically lock onto non-friendly aircraft.</p>
<p>The US wants to send people to the moon. Dream on. Lie Jang Wos eyes lit up and he became happy. Haha, Kobayashi, I knew you would do this. Let&#x27;s see how the US sends people to the moon this time.</p>
<p>Lynshan nodded and continued. Once the living quarters are built, the next step will be to begin the Helium 3 refining project. Okay, everything will be done as you requested. Then the two continued to discuss the relevant details and formulate a plan. At the same time, NASA headquarters in the United States.</p>
<p>Trudeau stared at the highresolution images transmitted back by the satellite, his pupils suddenly contracting. What&#x27;s this? How could there be such a structure on the moon? The assistant leaned closer, his voice weak. Director preliminary analysis indicates it was man-made. It might have been built by the Great Sea Kingdom. The Great Sa Kingdom? Duru shook his head frantically in denial.</p>
<p>Impossible. Absolutely impossible. He looked at the silver gray walls of the Guang Han Palace base one in the picture which showed no gaps under the satellite lens. How could the Great Sea Kingdom possibly possess such a level of construction? That&#x27;s the moon. If the Great Sea Kingdom had this kind of construction method, wouldn&#x27;t it have been used in their infrastructure long ago? Could it be an alien civilization? Thinking of this, Durit suddenly tensed up.</p>
<p>He then immediately convened a meeting with relevant experts. It was soon concluded that it was a base built on the moon by the great sea kingdom and it only took a very short time. Dur could no longer sit still and immediately went to report to Upton, the White House office. After listening to Durit&#x27;s report, Optton sneered. The Great Sa Kingdom is building a lunar base.</p>
<p>Does Trudeau himself believe that? How much time has passed? How could such a massive base have been built? This is clearly a smokeokc screen set up by the great Sia Kingdom to deceive us. Dur explained with a mournful face. Mr. President, the great Sea Kingdom has space planes and their infrastructure capabilities. Optin slammed his hand on the table, glaring at Dur.</p>
<p>Are you an idiot? Even if the Great Sa Kingdom has strong infrastructure capabilities, it is impossible to build such a huge complex in such a short time. But Durit wanted to explain further, but Optton interrupted him directly. No buts. The Starship will be carrying people to the moon in 3 days. proceed as planned.</p>
<p>Dur frowned. But the starship hasn&#x27;t undergone final testing yet, and the astronauts aren&#x27;t fully ready. Optin waved his hand dismissively. Even if we&#x27;re not fully prepared, we have to go. If we wait any longer, the Great Sea Kingdom will actually build the lunar base.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re just using a smoke screen right now, but if they keep dragging this out, they might actually succeed. All right, Durret had no choice but to agree. NASA headquarters. After Durit returned, he relayed Optton&#x27;s instructions. The chief engineer&#x27;s expression changed drastically in an instant.</p>
<p>Director, the Starship&#x27;s lunar module&#x27;s cushioning system was only tested twice. Dur closed his eyes and took a deep breath. There&#x27;s no other way. The president has given a death order. Everyone stay and work overtime.</p>
<p>Prioritize testing the life support system and conduct three more tests on the buffer devices. Even if we don&#x27;t sleep, we must minimize the risk. The engineers nodded in agreement and then began the final stages of their work. Durret watched their retreating figures silently praying in his heart. Hopefully this time it will be successful.</p>
<p>3 days later at 9:00 a.m. Starship rocket launch center. The Starship rocket stands on the launch pad, its entire body steel colored and emlazed with the American flag. Three astronauts dressed in orange space suits were helped by staff to the hatch. The global live broadcast signal has been turned on.</p>
<p>The number of online users on major platforms instantly exceeded 1 billion. Optin stood in front of the live broadcast camera, his voice passionate. Dear American people, dear fellow citizens of Earth, today we will set foot on the moon once again. We must prove that the US&#x27;s space technology is not inferior to that of great SIA. In the live stream, American nizens were spamming the chat with comments.</p>
<p>The US is awesome. This time we must succeed. Let the great Sia Kingdom see who the true space superpower is. Go for it. We must plant our national flag on the moon.</p>
<p>Many nizens from allied countries of the United States also sent their blessings and well-wishes. Instead, nizens from other countries began to mock them. In particular, nizens from the great Sea Kingdom began to make fun of it. Hilarious. A space superpower? They&#x27;re probably just giving us a free fireworks show.</p>
<p>Exactly. Weren&#x27;t the fireworks show last time enough? Are you coming again this time? Huh? I can&#x27;t wait for America&#x27;s big fireworks display this time. Launch center. Durret stared at the monitor screen, his heart filled with unease. He turned to the chief engineer beside him and asked, &quot;Is the check complete?&quot; The chief engineer nodded seriously.</p>
<p>Chief, the final check has been completed and there are no problems. Trudeau was about to nod. Optton standing nearby immediately gave the order. Times up. Start the ignition immediately.</p>
<p>Durret gritted his teeth and shouted into the microphone. Attention all units. Countdown begins. 10 9 8 1 Ignition. Orange red flames erupted from the bottom of the rocket and the heat wave overturned the rubble on the ground.</p>
<p>A tremendous roar resounded as the Starship rocket slowly ascended, trailing a long column of smoke as it hurdled into the sky. Optin instantly became excited, waving his fist. It&#x27;s taking off this time. It&#x27;s sure to succeed. The great Sa Kingdom wants to monopolize the moon&#x27;s resources.</p>
<p>Dream on. Laying duo standing to the side also breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile, &quot;Mr. President, you are wise. We, the American Empire, will never lag behind others.&quot; OPT nodded emphatically, his eyes filled with excitement. On the contrary, Trudeau was filled with worry.</p>
<p>Taking off is easy, but flying off Earth is the real challenge. The most difficult part is getting to the moon. There&#x27;s also the issue of lunar landing. In the live stream, the screen was flooded with comments from American nizens. Charge.</p>
<p>Get to the moon quickly. Let the great sea kingdom see our might. We, the United States, also want a share of lunar resources. Chapter 154. Starship rocket sores towards death.</p>
<p>the Starship rocket crew cabin. The three astronauts looked tense and worried. Hansen, do you think we&#x27;ll be able to successfully fly off Earth this time? Of the three, the youngest astronaut Band was filled with worry. He was also forced to participate in this man lunar landing because he owes a loan and can&#x27;t pay it back. He was eventually drafted by NASA.</p>
<p>As long as he participates in this man lunar landing, that would allow him to be exempt from the $300,000 in student loan debt. They even bought him a high-V value personal accident insurance policy with his parents as the beneficiaries. That&#x27;s why band agreed. Hansen was the eldest of the three and had participated in the first space station mission. He was selected to participate in this man lunar landing because he offended someone at NASA.</p>
<p>At this moment, Hansen remained expressionless as if he had already disregarded life and death. Bam. Don&#x27;t overthink it. Just let things take their natural course. The outcome is already predetermined.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Bamit seemed to understand something yet also seemed to understand nothing at all. And sitting in the very center is the female astronaut Lilith. She is the only female astronaut on this mission. She was actually quite excited. As the Starship rocket accelerated, she screamed, &quot;Ah, this is so exciting.</p>
<p>This is the feeling.&quot; It was as if she didn&#x27;t care whether the Starship rocket failed or not. All she wanted was this thrill. Hansen and Bamp shook their heads helplessly. Through their time together during the training, they gained a better understanding of Lilith&#x27;s personality. There&#x27;s nothing surprising about this.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the once aure sky gradually darkened. Orange red ionospheric light spots pelted the port hole like a rain of fire. The Starship began to shake violently, and the warning lights on the instrument panel flashed incessantly. The Starship rocket has entered the atmosphere. Will they survive? We&#x27;ll also see if we can break through the atmosphere this time.</p>
<p>Inside the crew cabin, all three closed their eyes. It was as if they were waiting for the moment of death to arrive. I don&#x27;t know how much time has passed. It felt like centuries. When they opened their eyes, they were already in space.</p>
<p>The distant blue star, like a sapphire set in black velvet, emits a soft light. The three of them were stunned at the same time. A few seconds later, Bam&#x27;s voice rang out, trembling with tears. We We&#x27;ve broken through the atmosphere. Hansen&#x27;s face was also filled with surprise and his voice was full of relief at surviving a disaster.</p>
<p>Yes, we&#x27;re out. Lilith looked out the window at the blue planet, her eyes filled with excitement. Haha, is this space? It&#x27;s so magnificent. All three were now fully alert and excited. It was able to successfully break through the atmosphere of Earth.</p>
<p>This proves that they have a chance of reaching the moon. At least they&#x27;re still alive. Whether or not a successful moon landing will be achieved depends entirely on fate. Ground launch center observation platform. Optin saw the Starship rocket break through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>He was so excited that he hugged Raymono tightly. Haha, we did it this time. Let&#x27;s see who dares to laugh at us. Optin&#x27;s voice was filled with frenzied excitement. Lay Manguo didn&#x27;t mind being hugged and echoed his words.</p>
<p>The president is wise. It is your decisiveness that has allowed us to take this crucial step. Durit, who was not far away, was not so relaxed. He stared at the fuel consumption data flashing on the screen, his brow furrowed. The chief engineer leaned closer and said in a low voice, &quot;Director, fuel consumption is 8% higher than expected.</p>
<p>If this continues, we may not be able to return safely from the moon.&quot; Durit&#x27;s heart sank. Looking at Optton, who was celebrating, he gritted his teeth and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t make a sound. Calculate the backup plan first. If all else fails, reduce the radius of the lunar orbit.&quot; The engineer nodded, then turned and hurried away. As Trudeau stared at the Starship on the screen, he silently prayed.</p>
<p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t let anything go wrong or the whole of NASA will be finished.&quot; in the global live broadcast room. The screen was instantly flooded with comments from American nizens, densely covering the entire screen. Ah, we&#x27;ve broken through the atmosphere. We&#x27;re going to land on the moon. I knew the US wouldn&#x27;t lose.</p>
<p>If Great Sia can do it, so can we? Who just said we were going to set off fireworks, come out and apologize? We, the Americans, must get half of the lunar resources. The entire United States was in a frenzy of celebration. The confidence they had lost was regained at this moment. Netizens in the US-led coalition also joined in the celebration. A South Korean nizen commented, &quot;Our American daddy is amazing.</p>
<p>Once you succeed, we want to go to the moon, too.&quot; A nizen from Australia commented, &quot;Luckily, we chose the right side. The Great Sia Kingdom is no match for us.&quot; European nizens, this time we will definitely catch up with the Great Sia Kingdom. They know perfectly well that the US&#x27;s approach is more backward than that of the great sea. But they still chose to follow the US and catching up. However, nizens in the great sea kingdom remained completely unperturbed.</p>
<p>Instead, they started making fun of each other. What&#x27;s the rush? We&#x27;ve only just broken through the atmosphere. We haven&#x27;t even reached the moon yet. I bet 5 cents that there will definitely be problems later on. After all, landing on the moon is no easy feat.</p>
<p>Are all people this confident these days? getting this excited just from leaving the atmosphere. This has generated excitement among those in the US-led alliance. The impression given to nizens of the great sea kingdom is that of someone who has never seen the world. They suddenly saw a small scene and made a big fuss about it. The lives of the people of the great sea kingdom are now vastly different from what they used to be and their national self-confidence has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Instead of being as wary of the US as before, we are not as fearful of it. More often people view it with a calm and slightly sarcastic attitude. This is the confidence that technological development has brought to the people of the great Sia Kingdom. At the same time, Siakiuan Linshen&#x27;s office, Kobayashi, the US Starship rockets have broken through space. Will they really be able to successfully land on the moon? After seeing the American rocket launch off Earth, Li Jian Guo couldn&#x27;t help but ask a question.</p>
<p>If the US really succeeds in sending a man moon landing, they will use this as an excuse to seize the moon&#x27;s resources. Lie Jian Guo didn&#x27;t want to see this either. Lynchin smiled. They want to go to the moon. Impossible.</p>
<p>Wasn&#x27;t there a shipment of supplies being sent to the moon today? If the US doesn&#x27;t run into any problems, then we&#x27;ll help them out. Li Jang Wos eyes lit up instantly. Shaolin, are you planning to intercept them on the road? Lynch nodded. That&#x27;s right. Anyone who tries to get their hands on the moon will end up like this.</p>
<p>The Kuing space plane has been equipped with a superpowered laser cannon. It&#x27;s to prevent any unexpected events from happening and to allow for self-defense. After all, there are often extraterrestrial meteorites in outer space. Sometimes, if you encounter one, you can use a superpowered laser cannon to destroy those extraterrestrial meteorites. Lie Jian Guo expressed his support.</p>
<p>Okay, then I&#x27;ll go and give the instructions to the pilots now. After saying that he immediately contacted the command center to issue an interception order. Chapter 155 unexpected incident. The US man spaceship is destroyed. Kimping space shuttle base.</p>
<p>Intercepting an American starship. Upon receiving the order, Lu Xiaoyang immediately became excited. Haha. Finally, another chance to make a contribution. He hasn&#x27;t had the opportunity to carry out combat missions since he destroyed the US power plant last time.</p>
<p>That time he was awarded a first class merit directly. In the family genealogy he was given a separate page. During this time he has been training new pilots. During this period there were a large number of lunar transport missions. Lu Xiaoyang was also transferred to be a pilot.</p>
<p>I originally thought it was just a simple flight mission. I never expected to encounter an interception mission. He has an excellent understanding of the weapon systems of the Kimping space plane. This interception mission will definitely succeed. Luos X Yaoyang took a deep breath, his eyes sharpening.</p>
<p>Then they began to operate the Kuanping space transport aircraft, which was fully loaded with supplies to take off. The anti-gravity engine roared to life. Like a silver lightning bolt, the Kuan Ping space plane broke through the atmosphere and flew towards outer space. At the same time, Starship lunar landing spacecraft in near Earth space. Bam stared at the blue planet outside the window, his fingers unconsciously stroking the bulkhead.</p>
<p>Hansen, are we now heading towards the moon? His voice was full of worry. According to the original plan, he only needed to go for a spin in space before returning. But two weeks ago, Optton issued a new order instructing them to land directly on the moon. This is no different from sending them to their deaths. But in order to repay his student loans, he had no choice but to accept it.</p>
<p>Hansen leaned back in his chair, nodding solemnly. Yes, it will probably take about 2 days. Their speed has only just reached the first cosmic velocity. It was barely able to escape Earth&#x27;s gravity and fly towards the moon. The whole process, if all goes smoothly, will take 2 days.</p>
<p>The journey to the moon was their safest time. Lilith was filled with excitement. We&#x27;re flying to the moon. How exciting. Bamit was speechless.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t even know if you&#x27;ll be able to come back yet. You&#x27;re so excited now. All he can do is pray to God that he will be able to land on the moon successfully. ground observation post at the US launch center. When they saw BA and his crew flying towards the moon, Optton immediately ordered champagne to be opened in celebration.</p>
<p>Optin raising a glass of champagne exclaimed joyfully, &quot;Come on everyone, let&#x27;s celebrate the complete success of our man spacecraft.&quot; Rayondo holding a glass of champagne exclaimed excitedly, &quot;Mr. President, the number of viewers in the global live stream has surpassed 1.5 billion. The entire planet Earth has witnessed the success of our eagle. Huh? Opton laughed heartily, downing his champagne in one gulp. The Great Sea Kingdom wants to monopolize the moon.</p>
<p>Dream on. Those around them echoed their agreement. Yes, let the great Sea Kingdom know that they are not qualified to monopolize the lunar resources. We&#x27;re going to build a bigger base on the moon and have the whole world follow us. Only Durret stood in the corner, staring at the fuel data on the screen, his brow furrowed.</p>
<p>The chief engineer leaned closer and whispered, &quot;Director, fuel consumption is still exceeding expectations. Even if we reach the moon, we may not be able to land smoothly.&quot; Trudeau gritted his teeth. &quot;Don&#x27;t make a sound. Let&#x27;s wait until they&#x27;re on the moon. If we tell anyone now,&quot; the president will eat us alive.&quot; The engineer nodded, turned back to stare at the screen, but felt uneasy.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the live stream, the American people also went wild. Huh? We&#x27;ve already flown to the moon, and this time we&#x27;re sure to succeed. Our America will soon become the second country on Earth to send people to the moon. I can&#x27;t wait. No one in this world can stop the progress of our America, not even Jesus.</p>
<p>The entire United States is celebrating. They seem to believe that the US will definitely succeed in sending a man moon landing this time. I hadn&#x27;t thought about what the consequences would be if I failed. I never imagined that other unexpected things would happen. Even the countries in the US-led alliance sent their blessings to Optinton.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the great Sia Kingdom was a little surprised. The US can actually fly to the moon. Looks like they&#x27;ve made some progress. He They&#x27;ve made progress, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like much. At this rate, will they even be able to come back from the moon? They wouldn&#x27;t be thinking of having our Kuwan Ping space plane bring them back, would they? If that&#x27;s really the case, then things will get interesting.</p>
<p>Celebrating with Champagne halfway through the game. Don&#x27;t they know that&#x27;s a major taboo? Chinese nizens didn&#x27;t feel threatened by the fact that the US could fly to the moon. Instead, they were more amused and teasing. Flying to the moon is easy, but the key is to log in successfully and return smoothly in space. Inside the Kimping space plane, Lu Xiaoyang stared at the 3D visual radar.</p>
<p>Found it. This is a bit slow. On the screen, the US Starship lunar landing spacecraft is flying in space. However, its speed is much slower compared to the Kuing space plane. After all, the Kuing space plane can reach a top speed of Mach 60.</p>
<p>The US lunar spacecraft, on the other hand, travels at only 7.99 km/s. Want to send people to the moon? You&#x27;ll be meeting your maker right now. A cold glint flashed in Lu Xiaoyangs eyes as he placed his finger on the activation button of the superpowered laser cannon, ready to attack. Just then, the radar suddenly emitted a piercing alarm. Beep beep beep.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang was stunned for a moment. What is that? He has flown to the moon several times. This is the first time this has happened. He quickly looked at the 3D visual radar. On the screen, an even faster point of light was rushing towards the US starship, faster than the quimping space plane.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a meteorite, Lu Xiaoyang exclaimed in surprise. Looks like the US is going to be in trouble without me even having to lift a finger. Based on the speed of that meteorite, it will collide with the US-man lunar landing spacecraft in a minute at most. Just in case, Lu Xiaoyang immediately had the laser cannon lock onto the meteorite. If that meteorite, the size of 10 basketball courts hadn&#x27;t disappeared after hitting the US man spacecraft.</p>
<p>He was about to intercept them immediately, we must not let it fly to Earth. on the other side inside the US lunar spacecraft. Bamp&#x27;s tense heart gradually relaxed as the spaceship continued its journey toward the moon. However, the alarm suddenly went off. Bamp was so frightened that cold sweat broke out on his forehead.</p>
<p>Hansen, what&#x27;s going on? Is there something wrong with the spaceship? Hansen&#x27;s expression changed drastically and he immediately looked at the radar screen. Damn it, there&#x27;s an unidentified flying object heading our way. Lilith&#x27;s smile froze on her face, her eyes filled with fear. UFO? Is it a meteorite? Can we get out of the way? Hansen&#x27;s fingers flew across the control panel, cold sweat beating on his forehead. No, it&#x27;s too fast.</p>
<p>Send a distress signal to the ground immediately. B Alliance operations. The distress message has just been sent. The meteorite crashed directly into the lunar spacecraft. Boom.</p>
<p>A huge fireball lit up the dark space. There was no sound. The starship was instantly engulfed in flames, turning into a giant fireball. A few seconds later, the fireball dissipated, leaving only countless fragments that slowly turned into cosmic dust. Bamp and his two companions also disappeared into space.</p>
<p>However, the meteorite did not disappear. It continued flying towards Blue Star. Chapter 156. The Great Sea Kingdom is the last hope of Blue Star. Inside the Kimping space plane, Lu Xiaoyang stared at the 3D visual radar.</p>
<p>On the screen, the wreckage of the American starship was still slowly drifting away. The US is really unlucky to have encountered a once in a millennium alien meteorite impact. Alas, what a pity for my warm merits. Lu Xaoyang couldn&#x27;t help but sigh. Just then, he suddenly realized that the meteorite had not disappeared.</p>
<p>Instead, it resembled a runaway behemoth charging straight toward the blue planet. Not good. Lu Xiaoyang started to get a little nervous. He had previously thought the meteorite would break apart upon impact. But now, it seems that the density of this meteorite is far greater than imagined.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang immediately pressed the communication button, his voice tinged with urgency. Ground control center. Ground control center. This is Lu Xiaoyang. The US spacecraft has been destroyed by a meteorite.</p>
<p>At the same time, that meteorite is hurtling towards Earth at a speed of 30 km per second. Please give instructions. Please give instructions. At the same time, US launch center. Optin was still holding a champagne glass, a smug smile on his face.</p>
<p>Haha. We&#x27;ll be able to land on the moon soon. This time, let&#x27;s see who dares to laugh at us Americans for faking it. The surrounding high-ranking US officials began to flatter and echo their sentiments. Mr.</p>
<p>President, you are wise. With your brilliant leadership, our eagle will surely become great again. Congratulations, Mr. President. We, the United States, will once again stand at the pinnacle of the world.</p>
<p>Mr. President, Upton was in high spirits as he listened to his subordinates compliments and laughed heartily. On the contrary, Durret always had a sense of forboding. Statue of Liberty, please bless me. Durret was praying silently.</p>
<p>Sudden a piercing alarm sounded at the launch center. Beep beep beep. Durret immediately tinsed up and hurriedly asked, &quot;What&#x27;s going on? It&#x27;s an emergency distress signal from the Starship lunar landing spacecraft.&quot; The technician answered in a flustered manner. Upon hearing this, Opton&#x27;s laughter abruptly stopped. Instead, his face darkened and he forced a smile, asking, &quot;What did you just say? Who sent the distress signal? Are you sure it&#x27;s not a malfunction in the alarm system? Seeing this, the speed demon, stealing himself, responded with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>Mr., it&#x27;s true. The lunar spacecraft has sent back a distress signal. The signal is just too weak. All we can hear is meteorite impact. Meteorite impact.</p>
<p>Optin&#x27;s mind went blank. He shoved the staff member aside and rushed to the monitor screen. on the screen. The light spot that originally represented the starship has disappeared. No, impossible.</p>
<p>How could I be so unlucky as to encounter an alien meteorite? Optton shook his head frantically. He simply couldn&#x27;t believe the devastating news. They were celebrating just a second ago. The next second, I received this devastating news. How can he accept this? Laying Duo and the others also turned pale, looking incredulous.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Optton roared at Durit. Druid, you&#x27;d better find out what&#x27;s going on right now. Durret nodded quickly and ordered, &quot;Quickly, try all communication links immediately.&quot; The technicians began to frantically operate the equipment. However, no matter how I tried, there was only silence on the communicator. &quot;Mr.</p>
<p>President,&quot; the technician&#x27;s voice was filled with despair. &quot;We can&#x27;t get in touch with him at all.&quot; Unable to get in touch, Opton staggered back a step, his face ashen. The excitement and pride I felt just moments ago have now turned into fear. He could almost see the public&#x27;s anger upon hearing the news. The media launched a barrage of criticism.</p>
<p>And then there were the opposition&#x27;s attempts to impeach him. Just then, another staff member rushed in, holding a report in his hand, his voice trembling uncontrollably. Mr. President, the astronomical monitoring center has issued a warning. A massive meteorite approximately 500 m in diameter is hurtling towards Earth.</p>
<p>Expected to collide with Earth in 1 hour. Boom. This statement was like a bomb exploding in the observation deck. Optin&#x27;s vision went black and he almost collapsed to the ground. Lay Ming Duo quickly supported him, his voice filled with panic.</p>
<p>Mr. President, what what should we do? A meteorite 500 m in diameter. Was it the one that destroyed our lunar spacecraft? Optin muttered to himself. He recalled the legend of the dinosaurs extinction. A single meteorite can wipe out an entire species.</p>
<p>Are we going to let Earth repeat the same mistakes? Optin suddenly realized what was happening. Announce the news immediately. Let the whole world know. Activate all defense systems simultaneously. No matter what it takes, we must stop the meteorite.</p>
<p>But he knew in his heart that the United States simply did not have the technology to intercept such a large meteorite. Our only hope lies with the great Sia Kingdom this moment. Instead, he let go of all his prejudices. I desperately hope that the great Sia Kingdom can stand up this time and turn the tide. After the news was released in the US live stream, the barrage of comments that were just celebrating vanished without a trace in an instant.</p>
<p>Instead, there was only deathly silence. A few seconds later, a flood of comments poured in. It was all panic and anger. What? The starship was destroyed by a meteorite. What about the three astronauts? My god, another giant meteorite is about to hit Earth.</p>
<p>Is this the end of the world? Optin, you liar. Didn&#x27;t you say you&#x27;d definitely succeed? What are we doing now? I don&#x27;t want to die. I have a wife and children. Someone, please save us. Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t Great Sea Kingdom have space fighters? Could they destroy the meteorite? The viewers in the live stream were filled with worry. those American nizens who previously mocked the great SIA kingdom. Everyone panicked at that moment. They flocked to the social media platforms of the great Sia Kingdom. He frantically posted online for help.</p>
<p>Friends of the great SIA kingdom, please save us. We know we were wrong. We shouldn&#x27;t have mocked you before. Please help us. Your space fighters are so powerful.</p>
<p>They can definitely stop the meteor. It&#x27;s not just the US. People in other countries around the world have also fallen into panic. They all thought of the white emperor sky fighter of the great sea kingdom. We want the great sea kingdom to take action.</p>
<p>Even nizens in the great sea kingdom were bewildered by this sudden news. Was the US man lunar landing spacecraft destroyed by a meteorite? This is so unlucky. And what the heck is that meteorite? A meteorite hitting Earth? Isn&#x27;t that just an old meteor shower? I heard that a diameter of over 500 m would pose a significant threat to Earth. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s just a meteorite. Our country will definitely take action.</p>
<p>After the initial surprise, nizens from the Great Sea Kingdom, I&#x27;m not too worried about the meteorite. It&#x27;s just a meteorite with a diameter of 500 m, isn&#x27;t it? Destroying it would be a piece of cake. Some netizens even suggested that the Great Sea Kingdom should capture the meteorite to see if it contained any of the precious metals from before. Many nizens from the great Sia Kingdom left messages on the official website of the Sea Academy of Sciences. They offered all sorts of bizarre suggestions.</p>
<p>Chapter 157 destroy the alien meteorite, the great Sia Kingdom. After receiving the message, the ground monitoring center. He immediately reported the news to Lie Jian Guo. At the same time, the military headquarters was notified. Syaki Yuan Lynchin was looking at the energy system parameters of the lunar base.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo suddenly pushed the door open. Shaolin, breaking news. An American starship has been destroyed by a meteorite. Destroyed by a meteorite. Lynchin was a little surprised, then smiled.</p>
<p>The US is really unlucky. Seeing that Li Jang Wuo looked a little anxious, he couldn&#x27;t help but ask oldly, &quot;Is there something else?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; Lie Jiano nodded, his tone somewhat heavy. That meteorite was 500 m in diameter, and it didn&#x27;t disappear because of it. It continued to fly towards our blue star. If we were to collide with Earth, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Although Earth is frequently struck by extraterrestrial meteorites, resulting in meteor showers. Lynchin knew this best. He obtained the seed of a level 9 cosmic civilization because he watched a meteor shower. But those were all relatively small meteorites. If the meteorite exceeds a certain size when passing through the atmosphere, they cannot be completely burned up, causing enormous damage to the ground.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s how the huge craters on the far side of the moon came about. Lynchin knew this well. He raised an eyebrow and said confidently, &quot;Old Lee, don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;s just an alien meteorite. We can destroy it easily now.&quot; After a pause, he directly offered a solution.</p>
<p>Let Luo Xiaoyang fire first and at the same time send more Kuan Ping space transport aircraft up. Also send out the White Emperor Aerospace fighters to form the last line of defense. Upon hearing this, Li Jang Wos eyes lit up. All right, how could I forget about the Kuaning space transport aircraft? We also have the Bitey aerospace fighter jet which is perfect for conducting a live fire exercise in outer space combat. I&#x27;ll contact the military right away.</p>
<p>After saying that, he immediately contacted Commander Louu of the aerospace force and ordered all Kimping space planes on the ground to take off. Go intercept that extraterrestrial meteorite. Kimping space shuttle base. Upon receiving the order, 15 Kimping space planes immediately took off. Quickly get to outer space as fast as you can and intercept the alien meteorite.</p>
<p>The pilots boarded the plane as quickly as possible. Then, one after another, the Kuing space planes began to take off. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared into the air. At the same time, upon receiving Li Jang Wos notification, Air Force Commander Lu immediately made emergency arrangements. Body aerospace fighter base.</p>
<p>50 Bethun Aerospace fighters were scrambled. The goal is to be the last line of defense in near-earth space. If it weren&#x27;t for the relatively short range of the body aerospace fighter jet, they could simply send by D out to destroy that meteorite, the internal channel of the White Emperor fighter jet formation. Quickly take off immediately. This is our first combat mission.</p>
<p>We must complete it perfectly. Receive. Captain, do we have a chance to make a difference this time? It&#x27;s hard to say. If the Kuan Ping space plane successfully intercepts us, we won&#x27;t have a chance. He I actually hope they fail to intercept us, then we&#x27;ll have a chance, right? How about we contact the Kuan Ping fleet and ask them to go easy on us? The pilots were all eager to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>Many hoped that the Kuaning aircraft fleet would fail to intercept them. The captain was speechless and reminded them, &quot;You all need to be serious. This is a formal combat order from the commander and there absolutely cannot be any problems. Receive.&quot; Then body space fighters began taking off. Their speed is slightly slower than that of the Kuing space plane.</p>
<p>However, a new White Emperor fighter jet is already under development. It will be equipped with controlled nuclear fusion and its speed will be increased to over Mach 100. That&#x27;s when the real space fighters will be. However, it will take some time. Currently, controlled nuclear fusion is being prioritized for the development of lunar bases and subsequent space city construction.</p>
<p>At the same time, emergency plans are being activated across the planet. US launch center. Optin stared at the radar screen, his hands clenched into fists. Are the missiles ready? Durret was covered in sweat and his voice trembled. Mr.</p>
<p>President, all intercontinental ballistic missiles are aimed at the meteorite. But experts say that at most it can only shatter the surface and the fragments will still fall onto Earth. Optin waved his hand. No matter if it really comes to that, we must launch missiles to intercept them. The other senior executives nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not just the US. Every nation on Earth capable of launching intercontinental ballistic missiles is preparing to launch missiles to intercept them. This is a crisis for Earth. We must go all out in space. After receiving orders from the ground, Lu Xiaoyang began attacking the meteorite with his superpowered laser cannon.</p>
<p>The laser cannon muzzle glowed with a ghostly blue light, continuously emitting super powerful laser beams. Each hit only destroys a very small area of the meteorite. So hard. What exactly is this meteorite made of? Lu Xiaoyang was somewhat surprised to see that the laser cannon had only destroyed 1% of the target after several minutes of destruction. At the same time, he also began to worry.</p>
<p>Just then, he saw another 15 Kuing space planes arriving. I immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Next, he directly contacted other Kuan Ping space planes and issued combat orders. Attention all units. Turn the super laser cannon to maximum power and fire at full speed.</p>
<p>Receive. All 16 kuing space blades open fire simultaneously. 16 terrifying superpowered laser beams struck the massive meteorite directly. The meteorite surface vaporized instantly, producing a huge white cloud of smoke. The silent explosion spread through space.</p>
<p>The rubble scattered like shooting stars. Luos Xiaoyang stared at the screen, his heart racing. How much larger is the meteorite? A few seconds later, the data came in. Report. There&#x27;s still 400 meters of diameter left.</p>
<p>Very good. Continue the attack. Lu Xiaoyang continued to give orders while also letting out a sigh of relief. The Kuing space plane continued its attacks. In space, beams of light kept flashing and then quickly disappearing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the meteorite was also shrinking. They disappeared completely after 10 minutes. Lu Xiaoyang became excited when he saw the meteorite destroyed, calling ground control. The meteorite has been destroyed. Earth is safe.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the message, the ground command center staff breathed a sigh of relief. At the same time, the news was reported to Lie Jian Guo Lynch&#x27;s office. Kobayashi, that meteorite has been destroyed. It was spectacular. The power of the super laser cannon is greater than I imagined.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos eyes were filled with excitement. My previous worries have completely disappeared. Lynshin nodded slightly. Elderly, this is just a microcosm of future space warfare. When you see a real space war, you&#x27;ll know what true grandeur is.</p>
<p>Space war? Will it really happen? Lie Jian Guo asked curiously. Who knows? Lynn Shay smiled mysteriously, then changed the subject. Now we can focus on building our lunar base. Chapter 158, America&#x27;s new target, Mars. Lie Jian Guo didn&#x27;t ask any further questions when he saw Lynchin deliberately changing the subject.</p>
<p>He knew that Lynchin must have his own secrets. Perhaps it&#x27;s because they have a clearer understanding of the universe. Whether extraterrestrial civilizations exist on Earth has not yet been confirmed, not to mention interstellar warfare. That&#x27;s still too far in the future for him. Lie Jian Guo felt that he was already very satisfied to be able to see the great Sia Kingdom develop lunar resources, especially during this period.</p>
<p>He felt his health deteriorating day by day. Who knows? He might suddenly collapse one day. But as long as Lynshin is there, none of that matters. It seems we need to arrange for Xiain to have a comprehensive health checkup. Lie Jian Guo thought to himself.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s always had this idea, but every time the topic came up, Lynchin refused, citing his busy work schedule. Construction of the lunar base is now on track. Next, Lynchin will have an easier time. Now, let&#x27;s see how Lynchin refuses. Lin Shan was unaware that Lie Jian Guo was already plotting against him.</p>
<p>At this point, he had already focused his attention on the construction of the lunar base. At the same time, the whole world is stunned. The US satellite launch center. Pass on my order. Prepare to launch.</p>
<p>Optin was already preparing to order the launch of missiles to intercept them. Suddenly, I heard Durid excitedly reporting. President, it&#x27;s gone. The meteorite has disappeared. What? Vanished.</p>
<p>Optin was a little surprised. Then his face instantly darkened as if he had just realized something. Did the Great Sa Kingdom make a move? The Luth nodded helplessly. Yes. The news from the astronomical observatory is that the meteorite was destroyed by a laser cannon.</p>
<p>Currently, only the Great Sa Kingdom has this capability. Sigh. It really is them. Optin side, his face filled with complex emotions. He hoped that the Great Sa Kingdom would take action to destroy the meteorite.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t want the great Sea Kingdom to continue to grow stronger. After this, the international prestige of the Great Sa Kingdom will surely soar once again. But the United States, the United States became a stepping stone for the Great Sia Kingdom to become powerful. Their lunar spacecraft was destroyed by that meteorite. However, the Great Sea Kingdom destroyed that meteorite.</p>
<p>Compared to those countries, the US is simply a joke because the contrast is too stark. Mr. President, what do we do now? Should we continue with manned lunar missions? Trudeau asked in a low voice. In truth, he no longer wanted to set his sights on the moon. The great Sea Kingdom has the capability to destroy such a massive extraterrestrial meteorite.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t they have the capability to destroy their lunar spacecraft? He had always had a vague suspicion in his mind. Even if their lunar spacecraft isn&#x27;t destroyed by an extraterrestrial meteorite this time, ultimately it will surely be destroyed by the Great Sea Kingdom. Given the current strength of the great SEA kingdom, we will certainly not allow any country to have any say in the moon. Just like the Americans back then. Upon hearing this, Opton fell silent.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s come to this. He had to reconsider the moon landing. The power of the great Sia Kingdom has exceeded his imagination. If they continue to cause trouble on the moon, it might provoke the Great Sa Kingdom to take direct action against them. Will they be able to contend with the Great Sea Kingdom then? The answer is no.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way now is to try to avoid conflict with the great sea kingdom. Then we will strive to develop science and technology and try to catch up with the great sea kingdom step by step. The moon has become the backyard of the great sea kingdom. But there are other planets. The US could easily set its sights on other planets.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Optton made a decision. Abandon the moon landing. But we want to go a step further and land directly on Mars. Landing on Mars. Dur was completely dumbfounded.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s going on here? They&#x27;re having trouble even getting into bed now. Still dreaming of landing on Mars. If we had that capability, we would have already landed people on the moon. Ignoring Durit&#x27;s reaction, Optton continued excitedly and firmly. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>We must land on Mars. Once we are the first to land on Mars, Mars will be ours. This is the fastest way for us to expand into space. The moon has already been settled by the Great Sea Kingdom. Then the Americans will go and occupy Mars.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are some surprises on Mars, too. Trudeau couldn&#x27;t help but advise. Mr. President, we&#x27;re already having trouble even sending people to the moon. Isn&#x27;t Mars a bit? OP waved his hand.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t say you had to finish it now. I&#x27;m giving you 6 months, no, a year. We&#x27;ll give you money if you want money, and we&#x27;ll give you manpower if you want manpower. One year from now, we can embark on our Eagle&#x27;s journey to explore Mars. Surely that&#x27;s all right.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Durat breathed a sigh of relief. A year? That&#x27;s worth a try. He thought Optton was going to send them to Mars in a month or two. He might as well just go home. No matter how much money or how many people are given, it&#x27;s impossible to do it.</p>
<p>But perhaps a year is a good time to give it a try. Very good. Go and convene an expert meeting now to come up with a concrete plan. When the time comes, I&#x27;ll go to Congress to get the money approved for you. After giving his instructions, Opton left the satellite launch center and returned home.</p>
<p>Durret also quickly convened a relevant meeting. On the other side, other countries on Earth also learned of the meteorite&#x27;s disappearance and breathed a sigh of relief. After learning that it was the Great Sa Kingdom that destroyed the meteorite, he then called the Great Sea Kingdom to express his gratitude. Furthermore, a public announcement was released thanking the Great Sia Kingdom for saving humanity from a crisis. At the same time, the internet is in an uproar.</p>
<p>Great, the meteorite has been destroyed. Thank you. Great Sia Kingdom. W The Great Sea Kingdom is the light of humanity. They are the true guardians.</p>
<p>Unlike some countries that only cause destruction, the Great Sia Kingdom will never let us down. Thank you, Great Sea Kingdom. At this moment, the international prestige of the Great Sia Kingdom soared dramatically. Even nizens from countries allied with the United States have begun to change their attitude towards the Great Sia Kingdom. Only a very small number of stubborn individuals slandered the Great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>For example, nizens in Japan still have that ugly face. Baka, why is it the Great Sa Kingdom again? It must be fake. Why would they be so kind? Damn it. The Great Sa Kingdom must be hiding something this time. Perhaps that meteorite was created by the Great Sea Kingdom itself.</p>
<p>Those Japanese devils felt even worse than if they had been killed when they saw how powerful the Great Sea Kingdom was. Especially seeing that the great sea kingdom has both spaceships and cancer cures and they can&#x27;t even resume work and production now. They live a miserable life every day. This comparison fueled their jealousy and resentment towards the great Sia kingdom. This caused their hatred for the great Sia kingdom to soar to its peak.</p>
<p>The prime minister&#x27;s residence in the land of cherry blossoms. Kisha Jurro felt more uncomfortable than if he had swallowed a dead fly when he saw the international countries showering the great Sia Kingdom with compliments. Damn the great Sia Kingdom. I&#x27;ll kill you all. You&#x27;ll all die in one more month.</p>
<p>Just then, his phone rang. Jiro Kishida picked it up and saw that it was Dr. Kawashima calling, so he quickly answered, &quot;Dr. Kawashima, is there some good news? Your Excellency, something terrible has happened. The T- virus has leaked.&quot; Chapter 159.</p>
<p>T- virus leak. What? The T- virus has leaked? How is that possible? Jiro Kishida&#x27;s voice was filled with shock and fear. He was well aware of the terrifying characteristics of the T- virus. The consequences of a leak would be unimaginable. This is undoubtedly a devastating blow to Japan.</p>
<p>Dr. Kawashima said in a panic tone on the other end of the phone, &quot;Your Excellency, it&#x27;s true. We must take action immediately or it will be too late.&quot; To date, they have not found an effective way to suppress the T- virus. If the virus were to spread to cities in Japan, just thinking about it sent chills down Kishida Jiro&#x27;s spine. Damn it, seal off the base immediately and prevent anyone from leaving.</p>
<p>Kishida Jiro roared and then hung up the phone. Damn it, these useless idiots actually made such a basic mistake. He angrily swept all the items on his desk to the floor. A moment later, he suppressed his anger and gradually calmed down, then immediately summoned Defense Minister Taro Yamamoto. Not long after, Taro Yamamoto rushed to the office.</p>
<p>Seeing Kishidro&#x27;s gloomy face, he couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Prime Minister, what happened?&quot; Kishidro took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, &quot;Something has happened at the biohazard base. The T- virus has leaked.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; Yamamoto&#x27;s expression changed drastically. &quot;Baka, how could this happen? The consequences of a potential T- virus leak are unimaginable. Although the biochemical base is located deep in the mountains, there are still animals living in the surrounding area. Once these animals become infected, Taro Yamamoto dared not think any further and hurriedly asked, &quot;Prime Minister, what should we do now?&quot; After a few seconds of silence, Kishaurro gave a solemn order.</p>
<p>Immediately dispatch troops to seal off the mountainous areas surrounding the base and at the same time evacuate all residents of the surrounding towns. In addition, send troops to clear all living things within a 10 km radius of the base. Remember, this matter must be kept secret. It must never be leaked. Yamamoto nodded and replied, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.&quot; At the same time, inside the biochemical base, Dr.</p>
<p>Dr. Kawashima gripped the phone tightly, his face filled with anxiety and helplessness. Just then, a researcher in a white coat rushed in frantically to report, &quot;Doctor, the base has completed quarantine, but the virus has already spread. What? It&#x27;s already gotten out.&quot; Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s vision went black and he almost fainted.</p>
<p>He barely managed to stand up by holding on to the table. &quot;It&#x27;s over. This time, Japan is really doomed,&quot; he muttered to himself. The base originally had multiple isolation measures in place to prevent leaks and to seal off specific areas immediately. However, his worst fears came true.</p>
<p>Doctor, what should we do now? The researcher asked anxiously. What should we do? A hint of despair flashed in Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s eyes, but it quickly turned into determination. Immediately seal off the entire base and prohibit anyone from entering or leaving. Do we really have to do this? Execute immediately if you want to live.</p>
<p>Dr. Kawashima shouted sternly. This decision means that the base will be completely isolated from the outside world. No matter what happens outside, the base will remain a self-contained world. Fortunately, the base has enough supplies to last for more than a year.</p>
<p>Even though the T- virus is rampant outside, this place can still remain relatively safe. In fact, Dr. Kawashima himself was not sure how infectious the T- virus was. But he dared not gamble. He only hoped that a drug to control the T- virus could be developed as soon as possible during the base lockdown.</p>
<p>Once the order was given, the biochemical base was completely sealed off from the inside and even the outer guards were ruthlessly abandoned. The guards saw the base gate suddenly close from the inside. They immediately realized that something was very wrong. Baka, what happened? Why is it sealed off from the inside? Why weren&#x27;t we notified from above? Damn it. Could it be? Just as the guards were cursing in disbelief, a rat infected with the T- virus quietly crept up to one of the guard&#x27;s feet and taking him by surprise, bit him hard.</p>
<p>Ouch, that hurts. A sharp pain shot through the guard&#x27;s foot. Looking down, he saw a rat biting his ankle tightly. In terror, he kicked the rat away and howled in pain, clutching his foot. But then he felt a chill run through his body, and his body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The surrounding guards quickly gathered around. Someone noticed the rat that had been kicked away and shouted an alarm, &quot;This This rat is suspicious.&quot; He then raised his gun and fired wildly, &quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!&quot; After a series of gunshots, the infected rat, despite its best efforts to dodge, was shot in the head. Other guards are treating the wounds of their injured comrade. Suddenly, the bitten guard&#x27;s eyes turned bloodshot, and he grabbed the arm of another guard and bit down hard. &quot;Huh! Baka! You bastard! What are you doing?&quot; The bitten guard struggled desperately in pain only to find that the other person was incredibly strong and he couldn&#x27;t break free at all.</p>
<p>Only when the infected guard let go, did he stagger to the side? A deep bite mark left on his arm. At this moment, the surrounding guards realized that something was wrong, and they all raised their guns and retreated, their eyes filled with fear and panic. Damn it, he must be infected. Quick, eliminate him. Before he could finish speaking, another gunshot rang out.</p>
<p>However, the infected person who was shot did not fall down. Instead, he let out a roar and rushed towards the guard who fired the shot at a speed far beyond that of an ordinary person. The guards were terrified at the sight and cried out, &quot;Oh no! Run!&quot; The monster that even bullets can&#x27;t kill is beyond their ability to deal with. Unfortunately, it was too late. Another guard who had been bitten also began to mutate and joined the bloody hunt.</p>
<p>Moments later, all 20 guards were transformed into bloodthirsty biommonsters. They left the base and wandered aimlessly in the surrounding area. Any creature they encounter along the way will not escape their clutches. The originally docel animals fell one after another under their attack and then mutated into new monsters. As time went on, the ranks of biommonsters continued to grow.</p>
<p>Some of the monsters have even approached the nearest village and launched attacks on the villagers. Baka monster run. The villagers fled in terror, but they were no match for the monsters. Ultimately, none of the hundreds of residents in the entire village survived. They were all transformed into biommonsters and then continued to spread to the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>And at this very moment, the troops dispatched by Kishaurro are still on their way. Chapter 160 completely out of control. On a mountain road, a long convoy of military vehicles sped along. Ordinary Japanese soldiers on the road were filled with curiosity when they saw it. What&#x27;s going on? Why are so many troops being deployed? Our island has been quite quiet lately.</p>
<p>We haven&#x27;t provoked anyone. Could it be that the Great Sa Kingdom is causing us trouble again? Many Japanese soldiers were speculating. They don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on yet. However, they will find out soon enough. On the other side, Yamamoto Taro sat in the command post, his eyes filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>How long until the troops reach the outskirts of the base? Report: At most half an hour. Another half hour, Yamamoto Taro said, somewhat dissatisfied. Tell them to speed things up and try to get there in 20 minutes. Okay. After receiving the order, the frontline troops began to accelerate at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>20 minutes later, they finally reached the outskirts of the base about 5 km away. Reporting to headquarters, we have reached the outer perimeter. The frontline commander is giving a report. Sudden bang. A loud bang came from behind the convoy.</p>
<p>The frontline commander turned around abruptly. In the rear view mirror, the window of the last military vehicle suddenly shattered. A blood soaked monster was outside the vehicle, viciously biting a soldier&#x27;s neck. Baka, what&#x27;s that? The frontline commander was terrified. At the same time, more biommonsters rushed out of the woods by the roadside.</p>
<p>They launched an attack on the Japanese army. Upon seeing this, the soldiers immediately opened fire in retaliation. Da da da. However, the bullets did not kill the biommon. This scene utterly terrified the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Baka bullets are useless against them. Run. These monsters are invincible. Oh, my leg. Help me.</p>
<p>Screams, gunshots, and the roars of monsters mingled together. The frontline commander pushed open the car door, drew his pistol, and rushed to the rear. The highway was in complete chaos. Three bio-engineered monsters are tearing apart a soldier. Their skin was bluish black.</p>
<p>Their muscles were bulging and their eyes were scarlet. The soldier&#x27;s rifle bullets hit them, leaving only white marks. They couldn&#x27;t penetrate them at all. Concentrate your firepower on the head. The captain roared and pointed his gun at the monster&#x27;s head.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Three bullets hit their targets in quick succession. The monster&#x27;s head shook, but instead of falling, it became even more ferocious. It pounced on the squad leader beside it and bit off his throat. Blood splattered on the front line commander&#x27;s face. His whole body was ice cold and his hands were trembling.</p>
<p>This is something that humans simply cannot fight against. Retreat. Retreat quickly behind the armored vehicles. The frontline commander roared and turned to run towards the command vehicle. However, the biommonsters were extremely fast, catching up with the fleeing soldiers in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>Screams continued to ring out. The frontline commander hid behind an armored vehicle, his face deathly pale. Quick, used a rocket launcher. The soldiers snapped out of their days and quickly picked up their rocket launchers. Aim, fire, boom.</p>
<p>The rocket, trailing flames, struck a monster. An explosion rang out and the monster&#x27;s body was blown to pieces. efficient, the survivors were instantly filled with hope. But the next second, even more monsters rushed out of the forest. A full thousand behind them followed a pack of mutated wild dogs and wild boars.</p>
<p>The wild dog was twice the size of a normal dog, and its teeth were as sharp as knives. Wild boars have skin as hard as iron, and bits of meat still cling to their tusks. How can there be so many? The frontline commander was completely panicked. They didn&#x27;t bring many rockets. The last round of launches has already consumed half of the energy.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no way to stop so many monsters. Thinking of this, the frontline commander immediately reported to Yamamoto. General, something terrible has happened. The infection source is out of control. Those infected have turned into monsters.</p>
<p>Bullets are useless against them. Requesting heavy firepower support. Before he could finish speaking, the armored vehicle carrying the frontline commander was overturned by a bio-engineered monster. Damn it. The frontline commander inside the armored vehicle was thrown around and became completely disoriented.</p>
<p>And outside the Japanese soldiers, seeing that they couldn&#x27;t escape, were utterly desperate. The biommon was getting closer and closer. Their roars seemed to be right next to my ears. Let&#x27;s give it our all. The Japanese soldiers picked up their bayonets and charged at the monster.</p>
<p>But as soon as he rushed out, he was pounced on by a mutated wild dog and bitten on the neck instantly. As more and more people are being bitten, the army of biommonsters is also growing wildly. At the same time, at the command center, Taro Yamamoto&#x27;s expression changed drastically upon hearing the various screams over the phone. Damn it, the interception failed. Quickly, send rocket launcher units to provide support.</p>
<p>Yes, General. Yamamoto realized that the situation was out of control. He hurriedly ran to report to Kishida Jiro, Prime Minister&#x27;s office. Jiro Kishida paced anxiously in his office. We must seal it off.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Just then, bang. The office door was suddenly pushed open. Taro Yamamoto rushed in looking flustered. Prime Minister, something terrible has happened.</p>
<p>When Kishid Jiro saw him like this, his heart sank. What happened? What situation has the troops encountered? Taro Yamamoto slumped to the ground, panting heavily, his voice trembling with tears. Monsters. So many monsters. Our soldiers can&#x27;t hold them off at all.</p>
<p>Bullets can&#x27;t penetrate their skin and rocket launchers can only kill a few. They have now broken through the blockade and are heading towards the surrounding towns. What? Kisha Jiro&#x27;s face turned deathly pale instantly. He staggered back a step and bumped into the desk. What did you say? They broke through the blockade.</p>
<p>How is that possible? Kisha Jiro rushed over, grabbed Yamamoto by the collar, and roared. I sent a whole regiment and armored vehicles. You&#x27;re telling me you can&#x27;t stop a bunch of monsters? Yamamoto Taro was gripped so tightly he could hardly breathe and tears streamed down his face. Prime Minister, those are no ordinary monsters. They are invulnerable to weapons, possess immense strength, and can infect others.</p>
<p>There are hardly any people left in our entire regiment. And and the surrounding villages have been attacked. The entire village has been turned into monsters. Boom. These words struck Kishaurro like a bolt from the blue.</p>
<p>He abruptly released his grip, took a few steps back, and slumped into the chair. &quot;The entire village has turned into monsters. Does that mean the T- virus has already spread? It&#x27;s all over. It&#x27;s all over.&quot; Kishida Jiro muttered to himself, his eyes vacant. He had previously harbored illusions, believing that as long as the mountainous area was sealed off, the situation could be brought under control.</p>
<p>But now, it seems he was too naive. The T- virus was spreading much faster than he had imagined. Prime Minister, what should we do now? Taro Yamamoto asked, trembling. Kisha Jiro suddenly raised his head, his eyes bloodshot. He suddenly thought of a solution.</p>
<p>Incineration. Yes, use fire. If bullets can&#x27;t penetrate them, surely flames can burn them to death. Kishida Jiro&#x27;s voice went mad. Immediately order the air force to scramble bombers.</p>
<p>Carpet bombing of the areas surrounding the mountains. Also, have all the town garrisons prepare flamethrowers. Burn any monsters you see. No matter the cost, we must wipe them out before they even reach the town. Yamamoto was stunned when he heard this carpet bombing.</p>
<p>What about the residents of the surrounding towns and those who haven&#x27;t been infected yet? Your excellency, wouldn&#x27;t this be? There&#x27;s no question of whether or not. Kishida Jiro interrupted him, roaring, no time to think about that now. If we don&#x27;t do this, the entire country of Sakura will be infected. Then everyone will turn into monsters. Go and carry out the order now.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re even a second late, we&#x27;ll both die.&quot; Seeing the crazed look in Kishida Jurro&#x27;s eyes, Yamamoto dared not argue any further. He struggled to his feet and staggered out of the office. In the office, Kishidurro sat in a chair, his hands behind his head. His body was still trembling. He didn&#x27;t know if his decision could save the country of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>All he knew was that this was the only solution he could think of right now. However, what Kishida Jiro didn&#x27;t know was at this time the ranks of biommonsters have grown to several thousand. They split into several groups and rushed toward different towns. One batch has already arrived at Chingshu Town, the closest town to the mountains. In Chingshu Town, the residents were unaware of the impending danger.</p>
<p>Children played in the streets, vendors hawkked their wares, and everything seemed so peaceful. Sudden, uh, a monster, a scream shattered the silence. A woman pointed to the entrance of the town, her face pale. A group of bio-engineered monsters were seen charging towards the town. They were incredibly fast, rushing into the street in an instant.</p>
<p>Runt. The residents realized what was happening and scattered in all directions, but their speed was nowhere near that of the monsters. The biio monster charged into the crowd and began to tear and bite wildly. Screams and cries echoed throughout the town. A security guard fired his gun, but the bullets hit the monster and had no effect.</p>
<p>The monster turned around and bit off his neck in one gulp. Blood stained the streets. More and more residents are being infected and turning into new monsters. The monsters ranks continue to grow. They surged like a tide into the depths of the town.</p>
<p>Chapter 161. Town Falls. News leaked. Chinshu town. The roar of the biommon pierced the sky.</p>
<p>The children&#x27;s crying stopped abruptly. A mother was running desperately while holding her child. The mutated wild dogs were hot on their heels. Don&#x27;t come any closer. Don&#x27;t come any closer.</p>
<p>The mother&#x27;s voice was choked with sobs. She slipped and fell heavily to the ground. The child rolled out of my arms. The mutated wild dog pounced, its sharp teeth biting the child&#x27;s calf. Ah.</p>
<p>The mother rushed over like a mad woman, but another biommon grabbed his shoulder. The bluish black claws pierced through the clothes and dug into the flesh. My child, my child. She struggled to turn around. All I could see was a child being torn apart by wild dogs, his blood staining the street red.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the child&#x27;s body began to convulse. His eyes slowly turned scarlet. He suddenly looked up and crawled towards his mother. The mother completely broke down and collapsed to the ground. &quot;No, this isn&#x27;t my child.&quot; The next second, the mutated child bit her wrist and she joined the army of biommonsters.</p>
<p>More Japanese soldiers were caught up while fleeing. Some had their throats torn apart by the monsters. Some had their bones broken by the mutated wild boars. On the street, people who are bitten will mutate within minutes. They stood up unsteadily.</p>
<p>With bloodshot eyes, it lunged at the survivors. The ranks of biommonsters are growing ever larger. From the initial thousands, it grew to more than 5,000. The entire town of Ching Shuer has been completely taken over by monsters. The last security guard is hiding in the police station.</p>
<p>He held the gun, his hands trembling. Outside the window, the monster&#x27;s roar grew closer and closer. Bang! The police station doors were kicked open. Several monsters rushed in. The security guards opened fire indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The bullets hit the monster, leaving only white marks. &quot;It&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;s completely useless.&quot; He threw away the gun and took a grenade from the drawer. &quot;I&#x27;ll take you all down with me.&quot; He pulled the safety pin and charged towards the horde of monsters. Boom! A loud bang! The grenade exploded, blasting several monsters away, but more monsters poured in.</p>
<p>The sheriff&#x27;s body was quickly devoured by the monster. Chingu town has completely fallen. At the same time, Sakura Country Air Force Base. Hundreds of fighter jets and bombers were scrambled with their weapons. The pilot&#x27;s expression was grave.</p>
<p>Target within a 10 km radius of the deep mountain base. execute carpet bombing. The command center issued an order. The bomber formation flew toward the target area. Half an hour later, above the deep mountains, fighter jets and bombers began dropping bombs.</p>
<p>Black bombs fell from the sky. Boom boom boom. Explosions rang out one after another. Flames shot into the sky and thick smoke billowed. The trees on the ground were uprooted.</p>
<p>The rocks were blasted into fragments. A bio-engineered monster hiding in the woods. Some were blown to pieces. Some were blown away by the shockwave. The mangled corpses were scattered all over the ground.</p>
<p>Report. First round of bombing complete. Pilots report. Command center. Continue.</p>
<p>Second round of bombing. The bombers dropped their bombs again. More bombs fell to the ground, but there are too many biommonsters. Many monsters hid in caves and ravines. The bombing could not possibly cover all areas.</p>
<p>The second round of bombing has ended. The pilot looked at the ground. report. A large number of biommonsters are still alive. The command center was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Returned to base. The bomber formation turned and left. The thick smoke slowly dissipated on the ground. The surviving biommonsters emerged from their hiding places. They stared at the corpses of their companions and howled.</p>
<p>Then they headed towards towns further away. Prime Minister&#x27;s office. Kishidurro sat in his office, his hands clenched tightly, his eyes fixed on the doorway. Knock knock knock. A knock came at the door.</p>
<p>Taro Yamamoto pushed open the door and came in, his face deathly pale. Your Majesty Prime Minister Kishidajiro suddenly stood up. How was the bombing? Were all the monsters wiped out? Taro Yamamoto lowered his head. No, the bombing only destroyed less than a third. What? Kishidurro grabbed Yamamoto Taro by the collar.</p>
<p>What did you say? One/3. His voice was his eyes were bloodshot. I sent all my bombers and fighters. I dropped so many bombs and you&#x27;re telling me I only destroyed a third of them. Taro Yamamoto dared not look up.</p>
<p>There are too many monsters and they&#x27;re very cunning. Kisha Jurro released his grip and staggered back a few steps. It&#x27;s all over. It&#x27;s all over. He muttered to himself.</p>
<p>The previous madness vanished, leaving only despair. Those monsters will keep spreading. The entire country of cherry blossoms will become a biological inferno. He held his head in his hands and squatted on the ground. His shoulders were trembling uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Taro Yamamoto looked at him as if he wanted to say something, but she couldn&#x27;t bring herself to say it. In the office, only Jiro Kishida&#x27;s suppressed sobs could be heard. Ching Shu Town. In the basement of a residential building, a young Japanese man was hiding in a corner holding a cell phone in his hand. On the screen was the video he had just filmed.</p>
<p>In the video, biommonsters are seen tearing residents apart. The mutated child bit its mother. Blood flowed like rivers in the streets. The Japanese soldiers hands trembled uncontrollably and tears streamed down his face. Mom and dad, I&#x27;m sorry.</p>
<p>He knew he couldn&#x27;t hide for long. Those biommonsters will find this place soon. He opened the social media app and uploaded the video to the internet. Shizu town has been taken over by monsters. Sakura country is doomed.</p>
<p>Click send. The next second, the basement door was kicked open. A bio-engineered monster rushed in. The man looked at the monster and closed his eyes. The phone slipped from my hand.</p>
<p>The screen went dark on the internet. The video was quickly shared. Japanese nizens were completely outraged. What is this? A movie clip? It doesn&#x27;t seem too real. Chinshu town.</p>
<p>My home is near Chinshu Town. Don&#x27;t lie to me. This isn&#x27;t true. At first, some people were skeptical, but more and more people are sharing it. Some people recognize the street in the video.</p>
<p>Some people are unable to contact their families in Chinguay town. Panic began to spread. There really is a monster. I just saw it. They&#x27;re coming towards our town.</p>
<p>Baka, what is the government doing? Why didn&#x27;t they tell us? Anger and panic were intertwined. Japan s social media platforms are in complete chaos. Netzens are posting like crazy. Some cursed the government for concealing the information. Some prayed that the monster wouldn&#x27;t come near.</p>
<p>Some packed their bags preparing to escape. The video was quickly uploaded to the international internet. Foreign nizens commented after seeing this. Is this a new kind of fantasy movie produced in Japan? The special effects are pretty good. It looks so real.</p>
<p>Who&#x27;s the director? Is Japan trying to gain popularity through biohazard horror movies? No. My friend is in Japan and he said something happened there. Really? Could there really be biomsters? At first, most foreign nizens thought it was a movie clip. But as more news came in, someone filmed footage of the Japanese air force bombing the island. Someone filmed the chaos in the town.</p>
<p>Nizens began to realize that something was wrong. It seems to be true. Japan really does have biommonsters. Oh my god, is this the end of the world through a biological apocalypse? Are they developing biological weapons? Has there been a leak? The discussion is becoming increasingly heated on the international internet. The Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>After seeing the video, nizens, could it be that Japan has been illegally researching biological viruses and accidentally leaked one? Japan brought this on itself. They deserve it. I hope it doesn&#x27;t spread to our country. Fortunately, our country is capable and not afraid of these monsters. Netzens discussed it.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they were grateful that they lived in the great Sia Kingdom. At the same time, governments around the world received the news. Many people called the prime minister&#x27;s office of Japan. The phone kept ringing in Kishida Jiro&#x27;s office. Yamamoto Taro looked at the constantly flashing phone and then at Kishid Jiro.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we&#x27;re getting calls from all over the world. Should we answer them? Kishid Jiro raised his head, his eyes empty. Tell them that Japan is finished. Chapter 162 UN General Assembly. A plea for the great SA kingdom to intervene.</p>
<p>The White House oval office. Optton received confirmation from Jiro Kishida. He was completely enraged. you Japanese idiots. They&#x27;ve really stirred up such a huge mess.</p>
<p>He tugged at his tie, his chest heaving violently. It&#x27;s one thing to conduct biochemical experiments secretly. There was even a leak and it got out of control. There a bunch of idiots. It took OPT a moment to calm down.</p>
<p>Just then, Mr. President, Secretary Pete has arrived. Opton calmed himself down. Let him in. Pete walked in with a grim expression.</p>
<p>Mr. President, according to feedback from our garrison, those biommonsters are immune to ordinary bullet attacks. Only heavy machine gun bullets or artillery shells can cause damage. Moreover, it&#x27;s spreading very quickly. Several towns in Japan have already fallen.</p>
<p>Opton sat on the sofa, clutching his hair in his hands. What do we do now? Will those monsters infect the marine life? Pete took a deep breath and walked to the map. Our Pacific fleet is approaching the waters of Japan, but the biommonsters are not within our range of response. He paused, then lowered his voice. The only country capable of resolving this quickly is the Great Sa Kingdom.</p>
<p>Opton looked up abruptly. The Great Sea Kingdom? What weapons do they have to deal with those biommonsters? Mr. President, have you forgotten the disappearances of the ghost toilets and nuclear power plants in Japan? Pete reminded him. That&#x27;s right, Optton exclaimed, figning sudden realization. If the Great Sea Kingdom used that mysterious weapon, it could absolutely wipe out those biommonsters.</p>
<p>But the thought of having to beg the Great Sea Kingdom made OPT feel terrible. But will the Great Sia Kingdom agree to intervene? Yes, it will. Pete nodded emphatically. If it were another country, the Great Sa Kingdom might refuse. But the Sakura Kingdom and the Great Sa Kingdom will definitely agree.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can discuss with our allies and convene a UN General Assembly meeting to ask the great Sia Kingdom to take action. That way, we won&#x27;t lose anything. Optin&#x27;s eyes lit up immediately after hearing this. Okay, we&#x27;ll go with your plan. Let&#x27;s hold a video conference with our allies now.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. 10 minutes later, a video conference was held. South Korean President Park Kong looked panicked. Mr. President, what about the situation in Japan? When will your army intervene? The prime minister of Australia slammed his fist on the table.</p>
<p>Mr. Eagle, just take action. If that doesn&#x27;t work, we&#x27;ll send a coalition force to bomb them. European heads of state also expressed their agreement. They all wanted to eliminate the biommonsters from the Sakura Kingdom as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We absolutely cannot let them spread. Optin looked at the people on the screen and cleared his throat. Everyone, I have a suggestion. Japan is out of control. If this drags on any longer, the entire planet will become a biological inferno.</p>
<p>I suggest convening a UN General Assembly meeting and then recommending that the great Sia Kingdom take action. Upon hearing this, the heads of states eyes lit up and they all nodded in agreement. Agree. Let&#x27;s do it this way. We will immediately notify the general assembly to convene a meeting.</p>
<p>An hour later, conference room at the UN headquarters. Representatives from various countries entered the venue. One after another, Ichiro Yamada, the representative of the Sakura country, walked in. He was surrounded by countless cold gazes. He shrank back and quickly walked to his seat.</p>
<p>The name plate on the table had been crossed out with a marker. Quiet. The UN Secretary General tapped his gavvel. We are now convening an emergency general assembly meeting on the topic, the T- virus leak in Japan and response measures. As soon as he finished speaking, the representative from the United States stood up first.</p>
<p>On behalf of the United States, I strongly condemn Japan. He held up a report. They illegally researched biological weapons, resulting in the T- virus leak, which has now caused thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of mutations. They are endangering the safety of all humanity. The South Korean representative immediately stood up, his voice filled with anger.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re so close to Japan, we&#x27;re bound to be affected. Japan must take responsibility. You must compensate us for our losses. Representatives from various countries delivered speeches, condemnations and angry shouts. Yamada Ichiro lowered his head and clenched his fists.</p>
<p>Sweat streamed down his face and dripped onto the table. Enough. The secretary general banged the gavl again. Please let the representative from the Sakura country speak. Yamada Ichiro slowly stood up, his eyes filled with pleading.</p>
<p>Everyone, I know it&#x27;s no use saying anything now, but those monsters are still spreading, and we no longer have the ability to resist them. I beg I beg all nations to lend a helping hand and help us eliminate the biio monster. The words had barely left his mouth. The conference room was silent. A few seconds later, the European Union representative sneered, &quot;Help you? When you were researching chemical weapons, why didn&#x27;t you think about this today?&quot; &quot;Exactly.</p>
<p>Why should we help you? We can help you, but you have to hand over all your biochemical research data first. Yamada Ichiro&#x27;s face was deathly pale, his lips trembling. The data. The data has been destroyed by the monster. Who are you kidding? The representative from the United States stood up.</p>
<p>I propose that the Great Sea Kingdom take the lead in forming an international rescue team to go to the Japanese Empire to eliminate the biommonsters. Agree. I agree. The Great Sa Kingdom possesses the most advanced weapons. only they can do this.</p>
<p>Representatives from various countries raised their hands. Yamada Ichiro suddenly looked up, a glimmer of hope flashing in his eyes. Will the great Sia Kingdom agree? Schwangu, the representative of the Great Sia Kingdom, slowly stood up and looked around the entire venue. Should we, the great Sia Kingdom, take action? It&#x27;s not impossible. However, he added, you will have to pay the price.</p>
<p>What price? Yamada Iro asked quickly. The representative of the great Sia Kingdom, Brother Schwang, said calmly, &quot;First of all, all your countries must compensate us for all the weapons and ammunition we have consumed.&quot; &quot;No problem,&quot; the American representative agreed immediately. &quot;Any other questions?&quot; Schwang Guu continued to make demands. &quot;Furthermore, when we take action, no country may interfere or raise any objections. Actually, before attending the conference, the headquarters of the great Sia Kingdom had already given him instructions.</p>
<p>Try to seize opportunities to act alone. Unexpectedly, the Americans themselves brought it up. This saves him the trouble of having to ask. Moreover, they can make all sorts of unreasonable demands. As expected, the representatives of the US-led alliance had no objections after listening to the report.</p>
<p>Representative of the great SEA Kingdom, we will absolutely not interfere with your actions. Yes. As long as you can eliminate all the biommonsters, you will be the greatest heroes of all mankind. Great SEA Kingdom, we will absolutely support your actions this time. Representatives from all countries express their views.</p>
<p>As long as the great Sia Kingdom can take action to eliminate the biommonsters, that&#x27;s fine. As for the process, they certainly don&#x27;t care. On the contrary, Ichiro Yamada, the representative of the Sakura country, was full of worries. Is the great Sya Kingdom acting alone? Japan. Then just thinking about it sent chills down his spine.</p>
<p>Chapter 163 for humanity. Our great SA kingdom will definitely take action. Yamada Ichiro s back was instantly soaked with cold sweat. I was just focused on calling for help. They didn&#x27;t give much thought to the consequences of the great Sia kingdom acting alone.</p>
<p>Calm down now. The more he thought about it, the more frightened he became. The great Sia Kingdom and the Cherry Blossom Kingdom. Who on the entire planet doesn&#x27;t know this? If the Great Sa Kingdom were to use the pretext of exterminating monsters, what if the towns of the Cherry Blossom Country are raised to the ground? No, we absolutely cannot allow the Great Sa Kingdom to act alone. He suddenly raised his head.</p>
<p>His face changed from pale to anxious. The voice trembled, but was unusually firm. No, I object. It&#x27;s too dangerous for the Great Sea Kingdom to act alone. For the safety of Earth, we should form a coalition.</p>
<p>All nations must send troops to jointly eradicate the monster. The words had barely left his mouth. The meeting room was silent. Representatives from other countries looked at each other in bewilderment. No one responded immediately.</p>
<p>Just then, Schwanga stood up abruptly. His eyes were sharp as knives. The voice was loud and clear, echoing throughout the entire conference hall. Representative Yamada, are you questioning the capabilities of the great Sia Kingdom? Are you still worried that we might take the opportunity to attack Japan? Yamada Ichiro froze when asked the question. His eyes darted away, avoiding direct eye contact with Schwango.</p>
<p>I I didn&#x27;t mean that. I just feel that the coalition forces are a safer option. Schwangu sneered, his tone suddenly becoming righteous and awe inspiring. Safety first. Every second we wait now is not enough.</p>
<p>Then even more people will be infected by the monster. How long will it take to form a coalition? How long does it take for the militaries of different countries to coordinate? By the time the coalition forces are fully formed, your country will have become a breeding ground for biological monsters. For the safety of all mankind, our great Sa Kingdom is willing to endure some hardship. I will take full responsibility for this. Go was secretly overjoyed.</p>
<p>He forced a smile to his lips. His eyes held in barely suppressed excitement. Very good. Japan took the initiative to oppose it. This gave the great Sia Kingdom an even stronger reason.</p>
<p>When it&#x27;s time to clear out the monsters, even if a few cities are accidentally destroyed, nobody can say anything. After all, it was the Sakura Kingdom that first questioned the Great Sia Kingdom. Now, the Great Sa Kingdom is taking action despite past grievances. Why do they have to be picky? Schwangu had just finished speaking. The US representative immediately stood up and said to Taro Yamada with dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Yamataro, don&#x27;t be ungrateful. How could you misunderstand the responsibility of the Great Sia Kingdom? The representative from the Great Sia Kingdom is right. Time waits for no one. Going it alone is the most efficient. We fully support you.</p>
<p>The South Korean representative quickly echoed this sentiment. His voice even louder than that of the US. The Great Sea Kingdom is the guardian of Blue Star. We believe in the strength of the Great Sea Kingdom. will implement the $100 billion compensation immediately.</p>
<p>The European Union representative nodded in agreement, his tone sincere. Thank you for your hard work, Great Sia Kingdom. For the sake of all mankind, we will not delay in providing follow-up material support. Representatives from countries such as Australia and Russia have expressed their views. All the voices were full of praise and support.</p>
<p>No one will mention forming a coalition for them. As long as we don&#x27;t have to send our own troops, no risk is involved. Donating money and supplies is nothing compared to what we&#x27;ve accomplished. This is a win-win situation for them. Yamada Ichiro watched this scene unfold.</p>
<p>My heart sank to the bottom. He opened his mouth, wanting to refute again, but he was interrupted by the UN Secretary General. The Secretary General picked up the gavvel. The glass slammed onto the table with a loud bang. The sound authoritative.</p>
<p>Quiet. Let&#x27;s vote now. We agree that the great SA kingdom can send troops alone to wipe out the biommonsters of the Sakura Kingdom and the countries that will jointly pay $100 billion in compensation. Please raise your hand.&quot; The words had barely left his mouth. Representatives from various countries raised their hands.</p>
<p>Throughout the conference hall, only the representative from the cherry blossom countries sat alone. No one raised their hand. The secretary general glanced at it, his tone leaving no room for argument. Passed unanimously. The resolution shall take effect immediately.</p>
<p>The army of the great Sia kingdom can enter the territory of the cherry blossom kingdom at any time. Yamada Ichiro slumped in his chair, his eyes vacant. He knew that Japan had completely lost the initiative. From now on, they can only be at the mercy of the great Sia Kingdom. The UN General Assembly meeting has concluded.</p>
<p>The news was relayed to various countries immediately. The White House Oval Office. Optin looked at the report and slammed his hand on the table in excitement. Great. The great SEA Kingdom has finally made a move.</p>
<p>100 billion US divided among various countries. We, the US military, will only contribute a billion. It&#x27;s totally worth it. Pit stood to the side, a smile on his face. Mr.</p>
<p>President, in this way, we don&#x27;t need to risk sending troops. It can also earn us a favor from the Great Sa Kingdom. That&#x27;s killing two birds with one stone. Optin smiled smugly, tapping his fingers lightly on the table. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Since we&#x27;ve done the Great Sa Kingdom a favor this time, they definitely won&#x27;t target us anymore. In this way, we will have time to develop in secret and strive to surpass the Great Sea Kingdom. Then he picked up the phone. His tone relaxed. Notify the Finance Department in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolution.</p>
<p>Transfer our share of the compensation to them. Just send 5 billion US directly and hurry up before the great SIA kingdom finds any fault with it. The other countries on earth reacted in the same way. After the news was sent back, they immediately transferred the compensation money to the great Sia Kingdom. Only the land of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>He was frowning because of the UN General Assembly&#x27;s resolution, the prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan. Jiro Kishida was sitting in his office, his hands clenched tightly, anxiously awaiting the outcome of the UN General Assembly. Knock-knock knock. A rapid knocking sounded on the door. Taro Yamamoto rushed in, his face deathly pale.</p>
<p>The voice was choked with sobs. Prime Minister, something terrible has happened. The UN General Assembly has passed a resolution. Kisha Jiro suddenly stood up, his heart pounding. How about it? Have all the countries agreed to send troops? Taro Yamamoto shook his head and spoke with difficulty.</p>
<p>Does it or not? The various countries agreed to allow the great Sia Kingdom to send troops alone. And we also have to pay the great SA kingdom 100 billion US in compensation. What? Kisha Dejiro was struck dumb. My body swayed and I almost fell. The great Sea Kingdom is sending troops alone 100 billion US.</p>
<p>Are they taking this opportunity to attack us? He suddenly looked up his eyes bloodshot. his voice. Did the great Sia Kingdom plan this all along? They were deliberately waiting for something to happen to us and then take the opportunity to attack us. Yamamoto Taro lowered his head, not daring to speak. He knew that saying anything now would be useless.</p>
<p>Japan has no room for resistance. Kishajurro was panting heavily, his eyes gradually turning crazed. No, I cannot let the Great Sa Kingdom succeed. Even if it means certain death, I will make the great Sia kingdom pay the price. He suddenly thought of something.</p>
<p>He walked quickly to the safe and opened the door. Take out a red box. Inside the box was a stamp with a cherry blossom pattern. Kisha Jurro picked up the seal. A strange smile curled at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>The great Sia Kingdom. You want to swallow up Japan? It&#x27;s not that easy. I have one last trump card. He turned to look at Yamamoto Taro, his tone icy. Initiate the operation jade shattering.</p>
<p>Let those biommonsters expand freely. Let their ranks grow stronger. Even if it means destruction. I want to drag the entire planet down with me. Kishida&#x27;s eyes were filled with madness and despair.</p>
<p>He knew what the consequences of this decision would be, but he had no way out. Alternatively, it could be controlled by the great Sia kingdom or let the entire planet Earth descend into chaos. He chose the latter. Chapter 164. or the Sakura country goes completely crazy.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Taro was stunned by Kishida Jiro&#x27;s madness. Kishid Jiro completely ignored him and continued to give orders. Yamamoto, pass on my orders. All troops that were trying to stop the biommonsters have been withdrawn. Self-defense forces from other regions are also being deployed eastward through the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Other regions, we can ignore them. The last few words spoken lightly carried a chilling undertone. Taro Yamamoto&#x27;s pupils shrank sharply and his face turned deathly pale. Primer Minister, have you gone mad? He rushed forward two steps, his voice trembling with tears. There are still hundreds of millions of people in other regions.</p>
<p>Without an army to stop them, those monsters will devour the entire Sakura country. We cannot abandon them. Kishidurro gave a cold laugh, his eyes as cold as ice. Give up. From the moment the UN General Assembly passed a resolution, we had no way out.</p>
<p>He pointed out the window, his voice suddenly rising. Don&#x27;t you know the feud between the Great Sea Kingdom and us? They sent troops alone, not to rescue us. They came to take advantage of our misfortune. It&#x27;s better to let the monster destroy the Great Sa Kingdom than to let it gain a good reputation. At that time, the entire planet Earth will be dragged down.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom wants to remain aloof. Dream on. As Yamamoto watched his manic behavior, his heart sank deeper and deeper. But but those people are innocent. Innocent? Kishid Jiro suddenly grabbed his collar, his nails digging deep into his flesh.</p>
<p>Talking about innocence now? Too late. Either we are controlled by the great Sa kingdom and become their puppets. Either we destroy the entire planet Earth with us. Which one do you choose? His eyes were bloodshot like those of a wild beast out of control. Yamamoto Taro was intimidated by his imposing presence, his lips trembling, unable to utter a word.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have time to waste with your words. Kisha Jiro shoved him aside and threw a signed order in front of him. Execute it immediately. If we waste any time, you&#x27;ll be the first one to die. Yamamoto Turo s hands trembled as he looked at the order stamped with a cherry blossom seal.</p>
<p>He knew that Kishaurro had completely gone mad, but he had no room to resist. He could only pick up the order and stagger out of the office. The moment the door closed, Kisha Jiro suddenly burst into laughter. The laughter was shrill and echoed in the empty office. The great Sia Kingdom Blue Star, you all just wait.</p>
<p>Even if I, Kisha Jiro, die, I will drag you all down to hell with me. Cherry Blossom Country, Western Military Base. A piercing alarm suddenly went off. The soldiers rushed out of the barracks, their faces full of confusion. What&#x27;s going on? have biom monsters attacked.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. We&#x27;re still hundreds of kilometers away from the monster zone. Just then, the commander holding the order stroed up to the platform. Attention all. His voice echoed throughout the base via broadcast by order of the prime minister.</p>
<p>Pack your gear immediately and abandon the base. In 2 hours, everyone will assemble in the east longitude direction. Repeat, abandon the base and regroup eastward. The soldiers immediately erupted in chaos. What? Abandon the base? What will happen to the people here? Commander, if we leave, who will protect them when the monsters come? The commander&#x27;s face turned ashen, and he slammed his fist on the table.</p>
<p>This is the prime minister&#x27;s order. Execute it. Anyone who dares to disobey will be dealt with according to military law. The Japanese soldiers could only lower their heads when they saw their commander&#x27;s cold gaze. One by one, they began frantically packing their equipment.</p>
<p>The truck roared to life carrying soldiers and supplies and headed east. The Japanese soldiers in the surrounding cities panicked completely at the site. Baka, why did the entire army withdraw? Could they be going to stop the biommonsters? Definitely. Our army will never abandon us. The same scene.</p>
<p>It took place at various military bases in Japan, northern border bases, eastern coastal bases, and garrisons on southern islands. Military vehicles carrying soldiers converged in the direction of east longitude. The troops that were originally guarding the various towns withdrew instantly. The entire Sakura country except for the eastern perimeter has completely lost its defenses. A town near Chingu town in a temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Dozens of survivors huddled in the abandoned warehouse, their faces gaunt. Suddenly, someone excitedly ran in holding a cell phone. Great, good news. The UN General Assembly has approved it. The Great Sea Kingdom will send troops alone to help us eliminate the monsters.</p>
<p>The survivors instantly raise their heads, their eyes gleaming with hope. Really? The Great Sea Kingdom is coming. Yoshi, we&#x27;re saved. I knew it. The Great Sea Kingdom are good people.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t stand by and watch someone die. An elderly woman tightly gripped the child beside her, tears streaming down her face. Child, can you hear me? The people of the great Sa Kingdom are coming. We won&#x27;t die.&quot; The child blinked and asked softly, &quot;Grandma, are the people of the Great Sia Kingdom as powerful as Superman?&quot; The old lady smiled and nodded. &quot;Yes, they&#x27;re even more amazing than Superman.</p>
<p>Once they arrive, all those monsters will be wiped out.&quot; Cheers erupted throughout the shelter. Someone took out the last of their food and shared it with everyone. Come on, let&#x27;s eat something and wait for the people from the great Sia Kingdom to arrive. We must thank them properly in the future. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Once this crisis is over, I definitely want to go and see the great Sia Kingdom. Everyone was overjoyed at being rescued. No one knew that the army they depended on for survival had quietly withdrawn. Little did anyone know that an even greater disaster was approaching them. Night fell.</p>
<p>Nar, a city in central Japan, is home to cherry blossoms. The streets were deserted with only the street lights casting a faint glow. Suddenly, a roar came from afar. The sounds grew closer and more frequent. A group of bio-engineered monsters are charging towards Nar.</p>
<p>Their numbers are several times greater than before. His bluish black skin gleamed in the moonlight, and his scarlet eyes were filled with a bloodthirsty desire. The troops that were originally guarding outside Nar Castle had already withdrawn. The monsters stormed into the city without any hindrance. Roar! A mutated wild boar smashed open the glass door of a store and began frantically tearing at the merchandise inside.</p>
<p>Several bio-engineered monsters rushed into the residential building and screams instantly erupted. Uh monster, help, Baka, where&#x27;s the army? Where&#x27;s the army? Why haven&#x27;t the people from the great Sia Kingdom arrived yet? The Japanese soldiers fled frantically, but their speed was no match for the monsters. Screams echoed in the silent night. The monster swept through the city like a tidal wave. Blood stain the streets.</p>
<p>The person bitten will turn into a new monster within minutes. Their ranks are growing larger and larger, heading madly towards the next city. Meanwhile, the surrounding areas to the east. A dense array of military vehicles converged here. The soldiers set up a makeshift defensive line, their faces showing exhaustion.</p>
<p>Taro Yamamoto stood on a high place looking at the dark night sky in the distance. His phone suddenly rang. After the call was connected, a trembling voice came from the other end. General N. Nar has been breached by monsters.</p>
<p>The entire city is finished. Taro Yamamoto&#x27;s body jolted and his phone slipped from his hand. The screen fell to the ground and shattered. He stared into the darkness in the distance, muttering to himself, &quot;It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s all over.&quot; Just then, a soldier came running over.</p>
<p>General, something terrible has happened. A large number of monsters have also been discovered in Chiba city to the east. They they are heading east. Taro Yamamoto looked up abruptly, his eyes filled with terror. He suddenly realized Jiro Kishida&#x27;s crazy decision did not drag Blue Star down with him.</p>
<p>Instead, it pushed the land of cherry blossoms into an abyss of no return. And Dong Jing, the capital of this cherry blossom country. Taro Yamamoto closed his eyes in despair. Japan is really doomed at this moment. He actually hoped that the Great Sea Kingdom would take action as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Chapter 165. Great Seia Kingdom. You&#x27;d better make a move. The results of the UN General Assembly were relayed back to the Great Sia Kingdom. The whole country was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Damn, that was a really good move by the UN General Assembly. A $100 billion compensation. And they want us to handle this alone. Isn&#x27;t that just handing over credit? Those little devils were so cocky back then. And now they know how to beg and plead.</p>
<p>People were excitedly discussing it in the streets and alleys. In the market, an older woman put down her shopping basket and scrolled through the news, her eyes crinkling with laughter. Those little devils got what&#x27;s coming to them. Let&#x27;s see if they&#x27;ll live or die this time. Once our great SA army takes action, we will absolutely guarantee the complete annihilation of all the biochemical monsters in the entire Sakura Kingdom.</p>
<p>Even the old man playing chess at the entrance of the residential area paused his game to discuss it. Once our white emperor fighters fly over, I guarantee those biommonsters will be completely wiped out. Excitement filled the entire Great Sea Kingdom. The internet is even more lively. The comment section of the Ministry of National Defense of the Great Sa Kingdom was flooded with messages in just half an hour.</p>
<p>We beg the military to give those Japanese devils a good beating. Don&#x27;t give them any face. Settle all the debts they owe us from back then this time. Don&#x27;t be soft-hearted. Let them see the might of our great Sia kingdom.</p>
<p>They must replenish the supplies they&#x27;ve consumed at double the rate. 100 billion is far too little. The comment section was filled with enthusiastic responses. One veteran even commented, &quot;If there is a war, I will be called back. I&#x27;ll be the first to take down the Japanese devils.&quot; At the same time, conference room of the great Sia State Military Headquarters.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was both serious and enthusiastic. General Jeang slammed his fist on the table, his voice booming. In my opinion, we should send three White Emperor squadrons over there directly. Bring annihilation bombs and wipe them out completely. Air Force Commander Lu shook his head, pointing at the map with his finger.</p>
<p>No, it&#x27;s too rushed. Monsters are everywhere in Japan now. Acting blindly could easily result in friendly fire. I suggest we send White Emperor fighters to scout ahead and find out the monsters distribution before we take action. In the meeting room, everyone chimed in with their opinions.</p>
<p>It will be impossible to reach a consensus in a short period of time. Seeing this, General had no choice but to speak up and stop it. Stop arguing. I suggest we ask Comrade Xan for his opinion on this. He might be able to devise the most perfect plan.</p>
<p>These words were spoken. The meeting room fell silent instantly. Everyone nodded in agreement. All right, let&#x27;s go ask Comrade Xiaoan. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Comrade Shaolin has a broader vision than us. He must have a good idea. The meeting ended quickly. General Jeang holding the meeting minutes contacted Lie Jian Guo at the Xiaku Academy. Lin Shan was staring at the energy data of the lunar base.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo pushed open the door and came in his tone urgent. Shaolin, General Jeang from the military just contacted me. They&#x27;re now seeking your advice on how to deal with the monsters of the Sakura Kingdom. Lynchin looked up, a faint smile playing on his lips. What&#x27;s the rush? Let the land of cherry blossoms be in chaos for a few more days.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo was stunned. If things remain chaotic for a few more days, won&#x27;t it completely spiral out of control? Lynchin pointed to the news on the screen and said calmly, &quot;Look, now the Japanese army has all withdrawn to Tokyo, and the rest of the country is full of monsters. If we intervene now, it will only be like cleaning up their mess, and we won&#x27;t get any credit for it. Only when they&#x27;ve almost completely lost their territory will the Japanese devils truly know fear. Only when we&#x27;re ready to act can we wipe out all the biochemical monsters at once and make other countries respect us more.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos eyes lit up. You mean deliberately wait a few days? Lynchin nodded. That&#x27;s right. Lie Jian Guo suddenly realized, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll listen to you. I&#x27;ll go back to headquarters right now and tell them to hold their troops back.</p>
<p>Lynchin added, &quot;By the way, have the intelligence department keep a close eye on Japan. Prepare the quantum annihilation bomb.&quot; Lie Jian Guo nodded in agreement and turned to leave in a hurry. At this time, all countries on Earth are paying close attention to the situation in Sakura country. Inside the White House in the US, Opton watched the news, his face growing increasingly grim. Damn it.</p>
<p>How could Japan have fallen so quickly? Pete stood to the side, his voice tense. Mr. President, Nara and Sheba have been taken over by monsters. If this continues, Japan won&#x27;t last more than a few days. Upton jumped up.</p>
<p>Quick, call the great Sia Kingdom. Get them to act quickly. Well add more money if they don&#x27;t have enough. Pete nodded quickly. Okay, I&#x27;ll go arrange it right away.</p>
<p>Of South Korea. Park Cop Chong trembled as he looked at the monster on the screen. Quickly, contact the representative of the great SIA kingdom. Tell them we&#x27;re willing to add another $20 billion. Tell them to send troops immediately.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let the monsters get into our country. European Union headquarters. Representatives from various countries sat together as anxious as ants on a hot pan. Why hasn&#x27;t the great SA kingdom made a move yet? If we wait any longer, those biom monsters might start spreading overseas. We&#x27;ll add more money.</p>
<p>Another 15 billion. Tell them to hurry up. Yes, join forces with other countries to put pressure on the great sea kingdom to take action as soon as possible. Soon the great sea kingdom received requests from various countries. The phone kept ringing.</p>
<p>They were all urging us to send troops and even offered to pay more money. The US said it would add another 5 billion, South Korea 20 billion and the European Union 15 billion. Other small countries have also expressed their willingness to contribute money and effort. Many foreign nizens have also sought help in the comments section of the Ministry of National Defense&#x27;s official website. Great Sia Kingdom, please act quickly.</p>
<p>It will be too late if we wait any longer. We&#x27;re willing to pay more as long as you can eliminate the monster. The Great Sa Kingdom is the guardian of Blue Star. Only you can save us. At this time, the land of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>As the bio-engineered army grows rapidly, the cherry blossom country fell was visibly accelerating. Meanwhile, those Japanese soldiers fled frantically in the east. A seaside city escaped the land of cherry blossoms directly by boat. Fortunately, other countries had already completed their evacuations. Only those who didn&#x27;t want to leave stayed in the land of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>At this point, no one cared whether they lived or died. The great Sia Kingdom at the Seyaku Academy. Lynchin looked at the requests from various countries and the corners of his mouth turned up slightly. Lie Jian Guo walked in smiling and asked Shaolin, &quot;All the countries are in a hurry now. When are we going to make a move?&quot; Lynshin smiled and calmly said, &quot;Wait three more days.</p>
<p>Well send troops again in 3 days.&quot; Lie Jian Guo asked in confusion, &quot;Why do we have to wait three more days?&quot; Lyn Shan pointed to the data on the document. &quot;In these 3 days, we can produce even more of the upgraded quantum annihilation bombs. It&#x27;ll be even more fun when it explodes.&quot; Lie Jang Wos eyes lit up. An upgraded version of the quantum annihilation bomb, the kind that can annihilate several kilometers away. Lyn Shan smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll find out when the time comes. After this, there will be no more cherry blossom island on Earth. Lie Jian Guo felt a surge of excitement, as if he could already see that spectacular scene. He thought Lynchin just wanted to teach the Japanese a lesson. Unexpectedly, Lynchin actually wanted to.</p>
<p>He certainly wouldn&#x27;t stop Linshin from making that decision. Their fate was sealed the moment they learned that the Japanese were secretly developing a biological virus. It&#x27;s just a matter of time. The Sakura National Assembly would be like in 3 days. Chapter 166.</p>
<p>The land of cherry blossoms has completely fallen. The next two days could be considered the most painful days in the history of Japan. The entire land of cherry blossoms except for the eastern part. All the other towns have become a monsters paradise. Sakata city, the ancient capital.</p>
<p>The streets are now full of biommonsters. They frantically tore at the Japanese soldiers who couldn&#x27;t escape in time. A corner of a shrine dedicated to Amitarasu Amakami in a certain place. There are two Japanese soldiers hiding here. W someone please save us.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to die. I don&#x27;t want to become one of those monsters. Was crying in fear. Another Japanese soldier muttered angrily. Shut up.</p>
<p>If we attract those monsters, everyone. He hadn&#x27;t finished speaking. Three bio-engineered rats darted out from the corner and pounced. Sharp teeth pierced through the shoulder of a Japanese soldier. Blood splattered on the face of another Japanese soldier.</p>
<p>The talking stopped abruptly. A few seconds later, the two Japanese soldiers transformed into biommonsters and began searching for targets to attack. This situation is playing out all over the country of Cherry Blossoms. Osaka. Containers at the port were overturned on the ground.</p>
<p>The goods inside were scattered all over the floor. Several biommonsters were tearing apart the crew members at the dock. If you get bitten, you&#x27;ll quickly turn into a biommon. Fortunately, those biommonsters seemed to be afraid of water and did not leave the land. On the other side, Nar Prefecture.</p>
<p>The animals in the park had long since disappeared, leaving only blood stains on the ground. A group of bio-engineered monsters surrounded a Buddhist statue. It scratched and clawed wildly. The Buddha statue&#x27;s head was broken off. It was thrown on the ground and trampled to pieces.</p>
<p>A former temple. It has now become a layer for bio-engineered monsters. One could hear a series of roars coming from inside. These are tragic scenes. It was captured clearly by satellite.</p>
<p>It was uploaded to the international internet. The world&#x27;s netizens were stunned. My god, is Japan completely finished? Those biommonsters are terrifying. No one can stop them. Why hasn&#x27;t the Great Sea Kingdom made a move yet? If we wait any longer, the monsters will spread to other countries.</p>
<p>Please, Great Sia Kingdom, act quickly. Don&#x27;t let the disaster spread. Governments around the world are also panicking. They all called the Great Sia Kingdom. The phone call was filled with Great Sea Kingdom, we beg you to send troops as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you need more money, please let us know and we will transfer the money immediately. We&#x27;ll agree to any conditions you set as long as we can eliminate the monster. They were utterly terrified. South Korea, it was a complete mess. South Korea and Japan are separated by the sea.</p>
<p>Everyone is afraid that monsters will cross the sea. Inside the presidential palace, Park Coke Chong Paced anxiously, yelling at the other executives. Damn it. Why hasn&#x27;t the great Sea Kingdom made a move yet? If we don&#x27;t act soon, the monster will come to our country. The foreign minister looking dejected replied.</p>
<p>They said we&#x27;ll have to wait. They&#x27;re preparing ammunition. Park Chong was still anxious. Keep calling the great Sia Kingdom and tell them we&#x27;re willing to add another $30 billion US in funding. Tell them to hurry up.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. President. On the other side of South Korea, South Koreans hold up signs kneeling at the entrance of the Great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s embassy. They cried out again and again, &quot;Great Sia Kingdom, save us.&quot; Some of the men even cowtowed, their foreheads bleeding from the impact. They just want the great Sia Kingdom to make a move as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Panic gripped the entire nation of South Korea. In the supermarket, rice, flour, and oil were all snatched up. Everyone is stockpiling supplies. They were terrified that if a monster came, there would be nothing to eat. Some people even bought lifeboats.</p>
<p>They were prepared to escape to the sea should anything happen. And the cherry blossom country is east of the line. the only city that did not fall. But it is also in a precarious situation at this moment. On the city&#x27;s defense line, the Japanese soldiers fired their guns desperately.</p>
<p>The bullet hit the monster. Only white marks remained. They can&#x27;t be harmed at all. Baka, the bullets are useless. Use the rocket launcher.</p>
<p>A commander roared. The soldiers quickly picked up the rocket launchers. Boom. A loud bang. Several monsters were blown away, but even more monsters surged up like the tide.</p>
<p>ammunition depot. The administrator was sweating profusely with anxiety. He shouted into the phone. Prime Minister, we&#x27;re almost out of ammunition. I can only hold on for another half hour at most.</p>
<p>If we don&#x27;t receive more supplies, we won&#x27;t be able to hold out. Inside the prime minister&#x27;s residence, Kishida Jurro sat in the chair, his face deathly pale. How could this happen? How could this happen? Jurro Kishida muttered to himself. His eyes were filled with regret. He shouldn&#x27;t have created the T- virus in the first place.</p>
<p>The death by Jade plan should never have been initiated. Now look what&#x27;s happened. The entire Sakura country is going to be destroyed by him. As for dragging other countries on Earth into this, absolutely impossible. Taro Yamamoto rushed in.</p>
<p>His face looked even worse than Kisha. Your excellency, something terrible has happened. The Western defense line has been breached. The monsters have stormed in. Our soldiers simply can&#x27;t hold them off.</p>
<p>Kishida Jiro suddenly stood up, swaying and almost falling over. Can&#x27;t stop it. How could it not be stopped? Don&#x27;t we still have so many troops? His voice was choked with sobs like that of a helpless child. Taro Yamamoto lowered his head, his voice trembling. The army, the army is about to collapse, too.</p>
<p>Many soldiers were bitten by monsters and turned into monsters themselves. No, impossible. Jurro Kishida shook his head frantically. He rushed to the desk. Pick up the phone.</p>
<p>I want to call other countries for help, but the phone was always busy. It&#x27;s impossible to get through. Why? Why is no one helping us? Kisha Jiro slumped to the ground, tears streaming down his face. He only understands now how foolish his crazy decision was back then. If only we had asked the great Sia Kingdom for help sooner.</p>
<p>If we hadn&#x27;t given up on other regions, Japan wouldn&#x27;t have fallen to this state. At this time inside the White House in the US, Opton watched the images transmitted from the satellite. His face was so gloomy it looked like it could drip water. Damn it. How can Japan be so useless? They couldn&#x27;t even hold out for that short time.</p>
<p>Pete stood to the side and said cautiously. Mr. President, the great Sia Kingdom is still silent. If we wait any longer, those monsters might spread all over the world. Should we? Should we prepare to launch a mushroom bomb? Opton looked up abruptly, a ruthless glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>Mushroom bomb. He was silent for a few seconds, then gritted his teeth, and said, &quot;Prepare yourself first. If the Great Sa Kingdom doesn&#x27;t make a move by tomorrow, let&#x27;s drop the mushroom bombs on Japan. Even if it destroys the land of cherry blossoms, we cannot allow the monsters to spread.&quot; Pete was startled, but nodded anyway. &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.&quot; Meanwhile, at the Seyaku Academy, Lynchin was looking at the screen.</p>
<p>The screen displays live footage of Japan. Lie Jian Guo walked in and asked seriously. Kobayashi, the situation is getting more and more urgent. Countries are urging us to take action and the US is even preparing to launch a nuclear bomb. When do we make our move? Lynn Shanun seeing that Japan was about to fall slowly spoke.</p>
<p>We can begin. However, let&#x27;s start with other cities first and leave the eastern longitude line for last. Chapter 1 167 annihilation begins. At the same time, the Sakura country is spreading like wildfire on the internet in the great Sia country. The nizens of the great Sia kingdom were in a frenzy.</p>
<p>Harah, the miserable state of those little devils is truly gratifying. When they were so arrogant back then, why didn&#x27;t they think of this day? Just wait. Once our country takes action, we guarantee they&#x27;ll disappear from this world. Not just online, all over the country of Dashia. Everywhere you look, people are happily discussing this topic.</p>
<p>Next to a chessboard downstairs in a residential building, the old men who used to play chess had long forgotten about winning or losing on the chessboard. Old Jeang tapped his pipe, his eyes gleaming with an alarming intensity. Let me tell you, back when I was in the army, I was looking forward to this day. Those little devils finally got what they deserved. Old next to him nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>Yes, this is what happens when you offend us. Body air force base. Air Force commander Lou&#x27;s eyes were filled with excitement. He looked at the pilots below and shouted the order. Everyone, you will be carrying out a special bombing mission today.</p>
<p>Objective: Eliminate all bio-engineered monsters in the Sakura country. Start with Kumamoto City. Bombard it indiscriminately. Receive. 100 pilots responded in unison.</p>
<p>The sound was so loud that the hanger trembled slightly. Their eyes were filled with excitement. It was as if they could see a great deal of military merit beckoning to them. Commander Louu nodded in satisfaction and waved his hand. Let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>100 pilots stood at attention and saluted, then turned to board the plane. On the runway, 100 white Emperor Aerospace fighters are neatly arranged. The fuselage gleamed with a cold metallic sheen. The upgraded quantum annihilation bombs in the bomb bay are like sleeping behemoths, ready to explode at any moment. take off.</p>
<p>As the command from the control tower was issued, the first white emperor fighter jet took off vertically, then accelerated and disappeared into the sky. Then, the second, the third, one after another, fighter jets shot into the blue sky like arrows released from a bow. Lu Xiaoyang was fortunate enough to participate in this bombing mission once again. As we got closer and closer to the Japanese invaders, my blood boiled with excitement. You little devils, I&#x27;m back again.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t get enough of that last time. This time, I&#x27;ll show you what despair really is. At the same time, Kumamoto City, Japan, also known as the land of cherry blossoms. The biommonsters are still roaming the streets. They tore at the dilapidated buildings, their roars echoing everywhere.</p>
<p>A giant mutated wild boar is ramming a residential building with its tusks inside an underground air raid shelter. There were still quite a few surviving Japanese soldiers hiding there. But at this moment, they were filled with despair and trembling. It&#x27;s over. No one&#x27;s coming to save us.</p>
<p>Why hasn&#x27;t the great Sia Kingdom made a move yet? Are we really going to turn into monsters? Just then, they heard a crashing sound coming from the entrance of the air raid shelter. They were so frightened that they trembled and dared not utter a sound. Just when they were in despair, White Emperor Space Fighter jets have arrived over Kumamoto City. Lu Xiaoyang stared at the 3D visual radar screen, sighing deeply. I never expected this.</p>
<p>The whole city is full of biommonsters. Are there still quite a few Japanese soldiers hiding in underground air raid shelters? Too bad. You&#x27;re all going to die this time. 3D visual radar can penetrate up to 100 m underground. Even the Japanese soldiers hiding in the air raid shelters could see it clearly.</p>
<p>And those biommonsters, they all had nowhere to hide. After observing the terrain, Lu Xiaoyang directly issued orders to White Emperor. White Emperor, begin deploying the quantum annihilation bombs. Remember, do not repeat yourself and do not let any living being escape. Roger.</p>
<p>Commence bombing orders. Immediately afterwards, White Emperor fighter jets began to enter automatic bombing mode. The first enhanced quantum annihilation bomb detached from the wing. It plummeted toward the ground. The instant of contact with the ground.</p>
<p>There was no earthshattering explosion. Only a blinding white light spread rapidly from the center of the bomb. Everything within a 5 km radius disappeared in the white light. Mutant wild boars, bio-engineered monsters, dilapidated buildings. Even the smell of blood in the air was completely erased.</p>
<p>On the ground, all that remained was a smooth circular crater 100 m deep, radiating faint energy fluctuations on the White Emperor fighter jet. This was the first time Luos Xiaoyang had witnessed the power of the enhanced quantum annihilation bomb. Unable to contain his excitement, he shouted, &quot;Holy crap, this power is terrifying, even more outrageous than a mushroom bomb. Those monsters and the Japanese devils underground, not even a trace was left. That power, it was far more terrifying than when he first bombed the Japanese toilets.&quot; At the same time, by the Air Force base command, Commander Lou saw the live footage of the bombing.</p>
<p>I was also completely shocked. This power is terrifying. Well done. Commander Lus eyes were filled with shock and excitement. On the other side, at the Seyaku Academy, Lynshin watched the live feed of Kumamoto City with a calm expression.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo leaned closer, his eyes filled with shock. This this upgraded annihilation bomb is terrifyingly powerful. Within a 5 km radius, instantly cleared. Lynchin nodded slightly. This is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Next, there are other cities. This time, Sakura Island is destined to become a sea of cherry blossoms. Upon hearing this, Li Jawa looked at Lyn Shun, his heart filled with apprehension. This is a real Yama. He didn&#x27;t expect that Lynch&#x27;s goal was not just to eliminate those biommonsters.</p>
<p>Instead, they want to sink the island. Just thinking about it sent chills down his spine. From now on, anyone who dares to provoke the Great Sa Kingdom will be punished. With Lynchin around, they&#x27;ll probably all be in a really bad situation, but he had no objection to Lynchen&#x27;s plan. He also wished that all the Japanese devils would disappear at this time.</p>
<p>The prime minister&#x27;s residence in Japan, Jiro Kishida trembled as he watched the images transmitted from the satellite. What? What kind of weapon is that? Why is he so strong? Taro Yamamoto&#x27;s face was deathly pale, and his voice was trembling with sobs. Prime Minister Kumamoto City is gone. The entire city of Kumamoto was wiped out by that white light. It&#x27;s become an ocean.</p>
<p>Jiro Kishida slumped into his chair, his eyes filled with despair. It&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s completely over. The Great Sia Kingdom. This is their objective.</p>
<p>At this moment, Kishida Jurro finally realized what was happening. He finally understood why the Great Sa Kingdom hadn&#x27;t taken action 2 days ago. So, they wanted to use this opportunity to annihilate them. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too late now. Meanwhile, in the government buildings of various countries on Earth, the officials looked at the images of Kumamoto City with varying expressions.</p>
<p>Inside the White House, Opton sat on the sofa, his coffee cup trembling. Damn it, the strength of the great Sia Kingdom has exceeded our expectations. That annihilation bomb, if it were used against us, it must have given him the creeps. My back was soaked with cold sweat. Pete stood to the side, his voice tense.</p>
<p>Mr. President, should we make preparations in advance? Optin took a deep breath and shook his head. Preparation? What preparations can we make? Fortunately, we didn&#x27;t completely offend the great Sia Kingdom. Remember, never provoke the great Sia Kingdom again. Understand? Understood? Pete nodded to see Opton finally show some intelligence.</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief. He was worried that Optton would act rashly and cause trouble for the great Sia Kingdom again. When that time comes, the Americans will truly be in trouble. Now, Opton clearly understands the terror of the Great Sia Kingdom. If the US continues to develop cautiously, things will eventually get better.</p>
<p>Chapter 168. The sea of cherry blossoms is gradually taking shape. Of South Korea, Park Quac Chongs legs went weak as he watched the screen. Thank goodness. Thank goodness we gave the great Sia Kingdom the money.</p>
<p>If they used this weapon against us, South Korea would have been wiped out long ago. The foreign minister nodded quickly. Mr. President, should we request an additional payment? How can we show our sincerity? Park Quong nodded immediately. Quickly, arrange it immediately.</p>
<p>Give the Great Sea Kingdom another 50 billion. We must make sure the Great Sea Kingdom is satisfied. Okay, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. At the same time, the other side of the blue planet, inside the palace of the wealthy desert kingdom of Saturday, the old king stared at the images transmitted from the satellite, filled with excitement. My god, this is the new weapon of the great Sia kingdom.</p>
<p>A 5 km radius instantly wiped out, more terrifying than a mushroom bomb. The defense minister beside him nodded, his eyes burning with fervor. Your majesty, this is absolutely the strongest weapon on earth. With it, we no longer need to fear the neighboring countries. The old king suddenly stood up, his tone urgent.</p>
<p>Immediately, contact the envoy of the great Sea Kingdom. I will buy this weapon at all costs. Money is no problem. Oil, minerals, they&#x27;ll give you whatever you want. The minister quickly replied, &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.&quot; The old king looked at the white light on the screen and a smile appeared on his lips.</p>
<p>Great Sia Kingdom, we must cling to their coattails this time. the wealthy countries in the desert region. They have already experienced firsthand the benefits of clinging to the powerful Sia Kingdom since the last time the Squids fighter jet was destroyed. They no longer dare to be arrogant. Even in desert regions, a brief period of peace is a rare treat.</p>
<p>Now, the fourth and fifth generation fighter jets they purchased have been delivered to the Great Sa Kingdom. Whether in military matters or in terms of personal connections, the richest countries in the desert are the strongest. No one dared to provoke them anymore. On the other side, Prime Minister&#x27;s office of the three Arab countries. Demo sat on the sofa, his forehead covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p>Damn it, how could the great Sia Kingdom possess such terrifying weapons? We used to dare to challenge them at the border, but now I&#x27;m terrified when I think about it. The Minister of Defense stood to one side, his face grave. Prime Minister, our border troops only withdrew 50 km last time. Isn&#x27;t that enough to ensure safety? What if? What if they misunderstand and think we&#x27;re hostile? Demo the immortal suddenly raised his hand, interrupting him. Retreat.</p>
<p>Retreat immediately. All border troops must withdraw another 50 km. Furthermore, pass on my orders. From this day forward, no soldier shall approach the border of the great Sia Kingdom. Anyone who dares to disobey will be dealt with according to military law.</p>
<p>The Minister of Defense nodded quickly. Yes, I&#x27;ll go and relay the order right away. Dimmo leaned back on the sofa and let out a long sigh of relief. The Great Sa Kingdom is a ferocious tiger now. We can&#x27;t afford to provoke them again.</p>
<p>How could I have thought of competing with the Great Sia Kingdom for lunar resources? That&#x27;s practically suicide. If they really anger the Great Sa Kingdom, they&#x27;ll bombard them. India, the consequences. Now, even Demo is glad they failed back then. What if we accidentally land on the moon? Perhaps things wouldn&#x27;t be like this now.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, old immortal demo still felt uneasy. He continued to issue orders. Make sure that all the people of the entire Indian kingdom treat the citizens of the great Sia Kingdom who come to their country with the highest level of care. We absolutely must not offend them. Anyone who provokes this will be prosecuted for treason.</p>
<p>Presidential office of the Philippines. President Moss Jr. stared at the screen, his body trembling uncontrollably. It&#x27;s over. They even seized islands and reefs from the great Sia kingdom before if they use weapons like this.</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more frightened he became, and he covered his face with his hands. The secretary walked in cautiously. President, are you all right? Little Moss suddenly looked up, his eyes filled with madness. Quickly, issue the order immediately. All fishing boats are strictly prohibited from approaching the waters of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Even accidentally crossing the line by 1 meter will be treated as treason. Also, evacuate the troops from those small islands and reefs we occupied earlier immediately. Withdraw all personnel and equipment. The secretary was stunned. Mr.</p>
<p>President, we&#x27;ve been working on those islands and reefs for years. Running a business, my ass. Little Mars roared. Staying alive is the most important thing right now. The great Sa Kingdom even dared to bomb the Sakura Kingdom.</p>
<p>Our strength is nothing compared to theirs. The secretary dared not offer any further advice and turned to leave quickly. Little Mars looked out the window. He had only one thought in his mind. I must not be targeted by the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>Otherwise, their Philippines will be in grave danger. Palace of Myanmar. The president looked at the screen, his face turning deathly pale. The Great Sa Kingdom is sending a warning to everyone. There are still quite a few Chinese citizens being detained in the telecom fraud industrial parks within our country.</p>
<p>He slammed his hand on the table, his tone resolute. Immediately, right now, order the army, destroy all the telecom fraud zones. Compile a list of the great Sia Kingdom personnel inside and repatriate them overnight. And those leaders in the park, don&#x27;t let a single one of them get away. Arrest them all and hand them over to the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>The interior minister standing nearby hesitated, then said, &quot;Mr. President, behind those industrial parks.&quot; &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter who&#x27;s behind us,&quot; the president interrupted him. &quot;If we don&#x27;t take a stand now, we&#x27;ll be the next Japan. We must resolve this matter before the great Sia Kingdom even remembers us.&quot; The minister of the interior nodded quickly. &quot;Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.&quot; The president gazed at the sea of cherry blossoms on the screen and silently prayed.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully, it&#x27;s not too late. Otherwise, they would be in big trouble this time on the international internet. It completely caused an uproar. My god, the weapons from the great Sia Kingdom are terrifying. I used to think that the US was the strongest, but now it seems that we are far behind.</p>
<p>Never mess with the great Sia Kingdom again, or you won&#x27;t even know how you died. European nizens, this isn&#x27;t a weapon. It&#x27;s God&#x27;s judgment. The Sakura Kingdom is completely finished this time. Luckily, we didn&#x27;t offend the great SIA kingdom.</p>
<p>A nizen from Australia commented, &quot;They used to provoke China alongside the US, and now I&#x27;m terrified just thinking about it. Quickly delete the previous posts, lest the great Sia Kingdom see them on the internet in the great Sia Kingdom. Netzens have gone completely crazy. Holy crap, what kind of new weapon is this? How can it be so incredibly powerful? Holy crap, instant annihilation. This weapon is awesome.</p>
<p>I suggest the military start a live stream. I&#x27;m willing to tip. I&#x27;ll donate a lot. I&#x27;d love to watch. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>If I could get sponsorship, I&#x27;d send a giant rocket. Netzens in the Great Sea Kingdom went completely crazy. Many people wanted the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s military to do a live broadcast. They want a sponsorship. On the other side, the White Emperor fighter jet formation has arrived in Sakata City.</p>
<p>The next goal is to annihilate Sakata City. Chapter 169. Biochemical base. Annihilation. White Emperor fighter jets arrived over Sakata City.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaoyang stared at the 3D visual radar. On the screen, there were countless biommonsters. There were also many Japanese soldiers hiding underground, not moving at all. Ah, looks like another city has fallen. Lu Xiaoyang sneered.</p>
<p>Tap your finger lightly on the control screen. White emperor, lock onto the core area of Sakata City. Prepare to deploy the quantum annihilation bomb. Received. Lock complete.</p>
<p>10-second countdown. Sakata City. The Japanese devils only had despair and fear in their eyes. Cries and curses rose and fell. Quickly, let us out.</p>
<p>Hiding here is just waiting to die. Kumamoto City is gone. It&#x27;s turned into the sea. If we don&#x27;t leave now, we&#x27;ll be annihilated. A young Japanese soldier slumped to the ground, his voice trembling with tears.</p>
<p>Why is the great Sea Kingdom treating us like this? We just want to live. An old Japanese soldier standing nearby had nothing but fear in his eyes. Now they only feel regret. We shouldn&#x27;t have denied history in the first place. Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t be in such a terrible situation now.</p>
<p>Just when they were filled with fear and despair, the quantum annihilation bomb has landed. Boom! There was no loud noise. There was only a beam of white light brighter than the sun. It spread rapidly from the center of the bomb within a 5 km radius. moving biommonsters, street buildings, cars parked on the roadside, Japanese devils, and underground air raid shelters.</p>
<p>Everything was instantly engulfed by the white light. Not even a trace was left. All that remained was a bottomless circular pit. It emanated a faint energy fluctuation on the white Emperor fighter jet. Lu Xiaoyang looked at the screen and excitedly pumped his fist.</p>
<p>Great, another one done. Continue the bombing. The bombing continued. The entire city of Sakata was bombed by 100 white emperor fighter planes. It quickly turned into a vast ocean.</p>
<p>Then they continued bombing other cities. At the same time, Dongjing city defense line. The defenses are about to break. Request backup immediately. The soldiers voices were filled with despair.</p>
<p>Sudden snap. The barbed wire fence of the defensive line was broken by a mutated wild boar. The monster swarmed in. Oh. A soldier was grabbed by the monster and instantly torn to pieces.</p>
<p>Blood splattered on the faces of the other soldiers. Panic spread like a plague. The soldiers began to retreat, some even abandoning their weapons and fleeing. We can&#x27;t hold them off. Run.</p>
<p>Eastern China is doomed. The defenses collapsed completely. Bio-engineered monsters stormed into the city. On the streets, the Japanese soldiers scattered and fled. Some hidden shops while others slipped into alleyways.</p>
<p>But the monsters were too fast. Screams continued to ring out. Baka, someone, please save us. Why? The biomsters are so scary. Why didn&#x27;t the great Sia Kingdom come to rescue us first? Even at this point, those Japanese devils were still blaming the great Sia Kingdom inside the prime minister&#x27;s residence.</p>
<p>Jiro Kishida trembled as he watched the live feed. How so? How could our defenses have fallen so quickly? Yamamoto Taro&#x27;s face was deathly pale and his voice was trembling with sobs. Prime Minister, there are too many monsters. The soldiers can&#x27;t hold them off at all. Now, now they&#x27;ve stormed into the city.</p>
<p>Kishida Jiro suddenly stood up, his eyes bloodshot. Air raid shelter. Quick, to the underground super air raid shelter. That place can protect against mushroom bombs. And we still have 6 months worth of supplies.</p>
<p>We can survive. A group of high-ranking officials hurriedly followed Kishidajiro and ran underground. No one spoke in the elevator. Only heavy breathing could be heard. As Kishidajiro watched the numbers in the elevator steadily decrease, only one thought occupied his mind.</p>
<p>We must survive. As long as you survive, there&#x27;s still a chance. Soon they arrived at the underground air raid shelter. Built at a cost of 10 billion US. The air raid shelter was very large and brightly lit.</p>
<p>It was filled with food, water, and medicine. There are also various communication devices. Kisha Jiro slumped into his chair and let out a long sigh. Thank goodness. Thank goodness we have this air raid shelter.</p>
<p>No matter how powerful the weapons of the great Sia Kingdom are, they can&#x27;t penetrate this place. Taro Yamamoto handed him a glass of water, his voice trembling. Your excellency outside has completely fallen. Eastern longitude is gone. Jiro Kishida took the water glass, his hands still trembling.</p>
<p>He looked at the water in the glass, which reflected his disheveled appearance. Suddenly, he slammed the water glass to the ground. Damn it, the great Sa Kingdom. I will not let you get away with this. Even if it means fighting to the very last moment, I will take you all down with me.</p>
<p>The other executives watched his frenzy behavior, and no one dared to speak. They all knew that saying anything now would be useless. They could only hide here and pray that the great Sa Kingdom would not find them. At this time, a biochemical base deep in the mountains. Dr.</p>
<p>Kawashima sat in the monitoring room watching the images on the screen. The scene shows Dong Jing City in chaos. Biommonsters ravaged the streets and the seawater continues to engulf the city. Dr. Kawashima&#x27;s eyes were filled with despair.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s over. The entire country of cherry blossoms is finished. Why did I develop the tea virus in the first place? Without it, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this situation today. He looked at the monitor, his face haggarded. The base still has plenty of supplies.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s enough for him and the other researchers to live on for more than a year. Thank goodness. Thank goodness we&#x27;re hiding here. No matter how powerful the weapons of the Great Sa Kingdom are, they can&#x27;t find this place. As long as we can develop a drug to control the T- virus, perhaps there is still a chance.</p>
<p>Just then, the monitor screen suddenly flickered. Dr. Kawashima looked up. his heart tightening. He saw a silver bomb falling from the sky in the video.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s heading directly towards the base. &quot;No!&quot; Dr. Kawashima screamed and jumped to his feet. &quot;How could this be? How could the great Sia Kingdom have found this place?&quot; He frantically rushed towards the door, trying to escape, but it was too late. A blinding white light came from above the base.</p>
<p>It pierced through the thick rock layer in an instant. The monitor screen turned completely white. Everything in the base, including Dr. Kawashima and the other researchers. It was instantly engulfed by the white light.</p>
<p>The ground began to collapse. The entire biochemical base along with the surrounding mountains. It was quickly covered by seaater. Only a calm sea surface remains. On the white emperor fighter jet, Luos Xiaoyang looked at the image on the screen and nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Done. Now the entire Sakura Island. It should have turned into a sea of cherry blossoms by now. He looked up at the window. The once famous Sakura Island is now 2/3 of its area covered by a vast sea.</p>
<p>Faint energy fluctuations still rippled across the sea surface. Only the cities around the eastern longitude remain, but it will be soon. The ammunition bay of the bitey aerospace fighter is now empty. They need to return to base to replenish their ammunition. Next time, the entire Sakura Island will disappear completely.</p>
<p>Chapter 170. There will never be another cherry blossom island in the world. Over the Pacific Ocean, reconnaissance satellites from various countries are closely monitoring the coordinates of what was once Japan, the land of cherry blossoms, the White House of the US. Optin stared at the images coming from the satellite, his fingers tapping unconsciously on the table. Have the Great Sa Kingdoms warplanes stopped bombing? Have they run out of ammunition? Pete&#x27;s eyes were complicated as he guessed.</p>
<p>Mr. president. They stopped bombing 10 minutes ago. They&#x27;ve probably gone back to resupply. But what Sakura Island looks like now on the screen.</p>
<p>Only onethird of the original Sakura Island remains. Large areas of the original city were covered by seawater. Optin took a deep breath, his voice tinged with lingering fear. Fortunately, we didn&#x27;t go head-to-head with the great Sia Kingdom back then. Otherwise, our American lands might become like this, too.</p>
<p>Yes. Pete nodded emphatically, his eyes filled with lingering fear. Who could have imagined that the great Xia Kingdom would be so terrifying of South Korea? Park Quac Chong stared at the satellite images, his eyes filled with fear. The land of cherry blossoms is completely finished. Is this the consequence of provoking the Great Sea Kingdom? The foreign minister nodded, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Mr. President, the additional $50 billion has already been transferred to the Great Sea Kingdom. You mean the great Sa Kingdom might not? Park Ko Chong turned around abruptly, glaring angrily. Shut up. Don&#x27;t overthink it.</p>
<p>From now on, we can only befriend the Great Sea Kingdom, not make enemies. Yes. Yes. On the international internet, the discussion forum exploded. An American nizen commented, &quot;Is this what the end of the world looks like? The whole country is flooded by the sea.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s terrifying.&quot; European nizens commented, &quot;I used to think that the mushroom bomb was the most powerful, but now it seems that the weapons of the great sea kingdom are the real Trump card.&quot; A nizen from Australia commented, &quot;Luckily, we didn&#x27;t offend the Great Sia Kingdom. Otherwise, we&#x27;d have nowhere to turn to cry now.&quot; In the comments section, the reaction was one of astonishment and lingering fear from nizens around the world. No one dares to mention the topic of the strongest on Earth anymore. Everyone knows that the great SEA Kingdom is now an unshakable force. Overseas communities and countries with cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers gathered around the television watching the cherry blossom sea on the news. Some people slumped to the ground clutching their hair, their cries horsearo. Baka, my home. My parents are still on cherry blossom island. Are they Are they already dead? Someone was smashing things and yelling, &quot;Great Kingdom, you are too cruel.</p>
<p>Why did you bomb our country and sink it? A middle-aged man next to him sneered, his eyes cold. Cruel. When your Japan denied history back then, did you never think of this day? This is retribution. The two groups of people instantly started fighting, crying, cursing, and fighting sounds mingled into a chaotic mess. The land of cherry blossoms, a super underground air raid shelter.</p>
<p>The lights were bright, yet there was a sense of oppressive stillness. Kishidajiro sat on the sofa expressionless with a dead pan face. Taro Yamamoto rushed in, his voice tinged with a hint of relief. Your Excellency, good news. The Great Sia Kingdoms warplanes have stopped bombing.</p>
<p>Jiro Kishida suddenly looked up, a glint of light flashing in his eyes. They&#x27;ve stopped bombing or or did they run out of ammunition and give up? Yes. Yamamoto nodded urgently. 10 minutes have passed and there&#x27;s still no sign of further bombing. The other executives breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Someone slumped into a chair, wiping the cold sweat from their face. Great. We&#x27;re finally safe. That&#x27;s right. There are 6 months worth of supplies here.</p>
<p>We can survive. Cheers erupted inside the air raid shelter. The long suppressed despair seemed to be replaced by a glimmer of hope. A moment later, Jiro Kishida stood up and walked to the monitor screen. On the screen, the streets of Dong Jing City are overrun by bio-engineered monsters.</p>
<p>The smile on his face froze instantly. Are there so many monsters outside? Yamamoto Taro&#x27;s face turned pale and he whispered, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot; After the defenses collapsed, the monsters took over the city. &quot;Now there are no living people outside.&quot; The cheers inside the air raid shelter came to an abrupt halt. The higher-ups watched the horrific scene on the screen. My relaxed mood quickly turned somber again.</p>
<p>Even if we manage to escape the bombing by the great Sia kingdom, the outside world is full of monsters. How will we ever get out? What if we run out of supplies after 6 months? Questions and criticisms arose one after another. Kisha Jiro roared angrily in a deep voice. Shut up. At least we&#x27;re alive now.</p>
<p>As long as you&#x27;re alive, there&#x27;s a chance. Once the Great Sa Kingdom gives up, we&#x27;ll figure out a way to eliminate the monster. No one spoke anymore. Only heavy breathing could be heard inside the air raid shelter. Can they really eliminate those biommonsters? Has the Great Sea Kingdom really given up? Half an hour later, Air Force base of the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Ammunition replenished. Energy system check normal. Radar system debugging complete. The ground crews report rang out from the control tower. Attention all personnel.</p>
<p>Boarding destination east longitude and surrounding area of Sacarajima. received. 100 white Emperor fighter jets took to the skies again. Not long after, the formation of BYI fighter jets arrived over eastern longitude. Lu Xiaoyang stared at the 3D visual radar.</p>
<p>On the screen, the location of the underground air raid shelter is clearly visible. The densely packed red dots inside represent high-ranking officials such as Jiro Kishida. We found you, Lu Xiaoyang smirked and pressed the release button. White Emperor, lock onto the underground super air raid shelter. Deploy the quantum annihilation bomb received.</p>
<p>Lock complete. 10-second countdown. Inside the underground air raid shelter. Jiro Kishida and other high-ranking officials are still praying. No, I don&#x27;t want to die.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t gotten my revenge yet. Amitarasu, please protect us. Other high-ranking officials also offered sincere prayers. It&#x27;s a pity. Their prayers had no effect.</p>
<p>The quantum annihilation bomb landed directly. Boom. There was no loud noise. There was only a beam of white light, brighter than the sun. Inside the underground air raid shelter.</p>
<p>Jiro, Kishida, Taro, Yamamoto, and all the high-ranking officials of Japan. It vanished instantly in the white light, leaving not a trace. The supplies and communication equipment inside the air raid shelter were also completely destroyed. The last piece of land around the eastern horizon gradually sank into the sea. The previously scattered land masses were completely covered by seaater.</p>
<p>The entire Sakura Island has been transformed into a vast sea. On the sea surface, faint energy fluctuations rippled like a huge piece of blue silk, eerily calm. On the white emperor fighter jet, Luos Xiaoyang looked at the screen and excitedly pumped his fist. It&#x27;s done. The entire Sakura Island has sunk completely.</p>
<p>The once Sakura Island is now just a vast sea, he picked up the communicator, his tone firm. Reporting to command, Sakura Island has been cleared. Requesting permission to return to base. The voice from the control tower came through. Received clearance to return.</p>
<p>Welcome home, heroes. Then the body aerospace fighter formation began its return journey. All the pilots had excited expressions on their faces to be able to personally participate in the annihilation of Sakura Island. That&#x27;s enough for them to brag about for a lifetime. Chapter 171 nationwide celebration.</p>
<p>The news reached back to China. The entire Great Sea Kingdom celebrated. Huh. We&#x27;ve finally waited for this day. I&#x27;m so happy.</p>
<p>The spirits of the martyrs can finally rest in peace. W I suddenly feel like crying. I finally gotten my revenge. People took to the streets waving their flags. The owner of the bubble tea shop was giving away drinks for free.</p>
<p>The rousing national anthem was playing on a loop from the loudspeaker. Many factories announced a half-day holiday to celebrate. Crowds celebrating this grand event can be seen everywhere in the streets and parks. At the same time, in a nursing home, the caregiver is holding a mobile phone. Tell the veterans about the formation of the sea of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>Grandpa Jeang, look. Sakura Island is gone. Jeangua is 98 years old this year. He lost a leg on the battlefield back then. His cloudy eyes stared at the sea of cherry blossoms on the screen.</p>
<p>His fingers trembled uncontrollably. A few seconds later, two streams of tears rolled down his cheeks. It dripped onto the back of my wrinkled hand. His voice was yet filled with barely suppressed excitement. Okay.</p>
<p>Okay. My comrades who sacrificed their lives back then. Did you see that? Our revenge has been achieved. As he spoke, he took out several military medals from the bedside and carefully hung them on his chest. Then he slowly struggled to get up.</p>
<p>The caregiver quickly helped him up, but he insisted on standing tall and facing east. He slowly gave a military salute that was not perfect, but extremely solemn. Tears streamed down his cheeks, soaking the metals on his chest. A cemetery for martyrs. It was already covered with flowers.</p>
<p>In front of the black tombstone, some people put down white chrysanthemums while others lit incense and candles. A middle-aged man squatted in front of a tombstone. His voice choked with sobs. Grandpa, I&#x27;m here to tell you something today. With Sakura Island gone, no one will dare to bully our great Sia Kingdom anymore.</p>
<p>He took a bottle of Baijo Chinese liquor out of his bag. He slowly collapsed in front of the tombstone. The wine seeped into the soil. It&#x27;s as if we&#x27;re sharing this belated joy with the heroes who died in the afterlife. Not far away, a group of students in school uniforms stood in neat rows.</p>
<p>We bow to the martyrs. His young face was filled with reverence. The entire great sea kingdom was celebrating. Some are happy, some are sad. The White House of the US, the sea of cherry blossoms transmitted via satellite.</p>
<p>His eyes were filled with nothing but fear. After a moment, he gave a stern order. Pass on my orders. All troops stationed in the first and second island chains must be withdrawn to their homelands within 3 days. Pete stood to the side, his face filled with shock.</p>
<p>Mr. President, this is a crucial strategic deployment for us in the Asia-Pacific region. No buts, optin interrupted him. The current strength of the Great Sia Kingdom is beyond our ability to provoke. Keeping those troops there will only make the Great Sia Kingdom think we have ulterior motives.</p>
<p>He paused, then added. And Dragonclaw Island, bring back all the people hiding there. From now on, no department is allowed to participate in anything related to Dragonclaw Island. Pete dared not refute any further and quickly nodded. Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away.</p>
<p>Of South Korea, Park Kong summoned all cabinet members to the meeting room. The screen displayed footage of the great Sia Kingdom celebrating. Did you see that? Park Chongs voice was more serious than ever before. From today onwards, give me a death order. No citizen of South Korea shall provoke a citizen of Great Sea, whether in China or overseas.</p>
<p>He pointed to the foreign secretary. You take the lead immediately and lies with the ministry of foreign affairs of the great sea kingdom. Draft a friendly citizen protection ordinance. If there are South Koreans, they would dare to bully the overseas citizens of the great Sia Kingdom. Treat him directly as a treasoner.</p>
<p>The foreign minister quickly responded. Yes, Mr. President. Prime Minister&#x27;s office of the three Arab countries. Demo.</p>
<p>The elders summoned the minister of defense and the minister of the interior to his office. Have you withdrawn all the border troops that we ordered you to withdraw before? The Minister of Defense nodded quickly, reporting to the Prime Minister. Everyone has been evacuated to their designated locations. Not enough. Demo the immortal slammed his hand on the table.</p>
<p>Retreat another 30 km. Also tell all Indian citizens, &quot;What if I encounter a citizen of the great Sia Kingdom abroad? Respect must be maintained. Who dares to have a conflict with a citizen of the Great Sea Kingdom? Regardless of right or wrong, arrest them first. The interior minister hesitated for a moment. Prime Minister, isn&#x27;t this too harsh? Demo the immortal glared at him.</p>
<p>Harsh? Didn&#x27;t you see what happened to Japan? Compared to the great Sia Kingdom, what are our harsh standards? If the stupidity of one citizen puts the entire country of India in danger, are you capable of taking on this responsibility? The interior minister fell silent instantly. He nodded quickly in agreement. Almost every country on earth has revised its policies. Do not provoke the great Sia Kingdom. This is what the great man meant when he said, &quot;If you throw one punch, you&#x27;ll win a 100.&quot; The great Sia Kingdom, Sia Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Li Jang Wos face was filled with excitement. Kobayashi, the matter on Sakura Island has been resolved. After this, no one should dare to provoke our great Sia Kingdom again. Lynch nodded. That&#x27;s for sure.</p>
<p>Then he stood up and stood in front of the huge map, pointing his finger at the location of Dragonclaw Island. Oldly it&#x27;s time to come back to this place. Li Jang Wos eyes sharpened. Shaolin, you mean? Lynch nodded emphatically. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Now is the best time. Dragonclaw Island. It has always been a thorn in the side of everyone in the Great Sea Kingdom. Previously, due to external environmental reasons, there has been no way to bring it back. The Great Sa Kingdom is now powerful enough to fear no force.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time for Dragonclaw Island to return. Okay, I&#x27;ll go contact General and the others right away. Lie Jian Guo excitedly agreed regarding this matter. He would definitely agree wholeheartedly. Then Li Jang Wo hurriedly left to find and contact General Xang.</p>
<p>Dragonclaw Island. Inside a luxurious villa, the traitor leader, Ziao Tian, paced restlessly in the room, his face filled with panic. Before, with Japan and the United States backing them up, he even dared to act arrogantly on Dragonclaw Island. But now, Sakura Island sank. The US also withdrew all its personnel.</p>
<p>He was like a discarded pawn. What to do? What to do? He clutched his hair, his eyes filled with despair. At this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open. His men rushed in in a panic. Chief, something terrible has happened.</p>
<p>The rest of the islanders started packing their things, preparing to flee overseas. There are also people who have contacted the relevant departments of the Great Sea Kingdom, wanting to turn themselves in. Ziao Tian trembled and staggered back a few steps. Confess? They actually dared to confess. He suddenly looked up, a fierce glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>No, I can&#x27;t let this end. He took a pistol from the drawer and stuffed it into his pocket. I want to leave too. Quick, take me to a private jet and get me out of here. Chapter 172.</p>
<p>Recapture of Dragon Claw Island. After Li Jian Guo returned to his office, he then took out his encrypted phone and called General Jeang. Old Jang Shaolin suggests. On the other end of the phone, General Jeang was a little puzzled after listening to the story. Old Lee, how come comrade Shaolin is thinking the same way as our military headquarters? Li Jian Guo was taken aback for a moment, then realized what was happening.</p>
<p>Did you have this planned all along? Of course. General Cienangs voice carried a hint of pride. Our military has been planning this for a long time. We&#x27;ve just been waiting for the right opportunity, and now is the best opportunity. Currently, all fleets and submarines.</p>
<p>They are all on standby in the waters surrounding Dragonclaw Island. Upon hearing this, Li Jango instantly became excited. Great. Great. This time, my dream will definitely come true.</p>
<p>General Xang solemnly assured. You can put comrade Xiaolins mind at ease. We will definitely handle whatever needs to be handled. We will absolutely not let him down. Understood.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo nodded. After hanging up the call, Li Jang Guo then told Lynch the news. Lynch was very satisfied with this. Then, I continued to keep an eye on the lunar base. At the same time, Dragonclaw Island leader Tienhu has already boarded his private jet.</p>
<p>Quickly, take off immediately. Ziao Tinhu urged him frantically, but tragedy struck. &quot;Chief, we&#x27;re experiencing signal interference. The plane can&#x27;t take off normally. What?&quot; Tian who was terrified and roared, &quot;Useless! All of you are useless.&quot; At the same time, despair began to creep into his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Even airplanes can&#x27;t take off. There&#x27;s no way to escape.&quot; when I think about what he did before. If I get caught, the consequences will be absolutely. The thought alone sent chills down his spine. At this moment, the deputy beside him spoke up tremblingly.</p>
<p>Chief, we can go through the secret port behind the mountain. There&#x27;s a speedboat there that can go directly to international waters. Well be safe once we reach international waters. Tinu instantly became excited. Real? Absolutely true? The deputy nodded quickly.</p>
<p>Then what are you waiting for? Xiao Tinian who suddenly stood up. Take me to the secret port immediately. The deputy quickly agreed and ran off the plane. Tian who also ran off the plane. He has only one thought right now.</p>
<p>It means leaving Dragonclaw Island. Even if it&#x27;s just swimming, I&#x27;ll leave. Half an hour later, in a secret port on Dragonclaw Island, a black speedboat is mored on the shore. Xiao Tin who arrived in a hurry with several trusted men, each carrying a backpack full of cash. Quick, get on the boat.</p>
<p>Xiao Tinhu stepped onto the speedboat and urged them on. The trusted men jumped onto the ship and started the engine. The speedboat sped off toward the high seas. Zhiao Tinu stood at the bow of the boat, laughing triumphantly. Great, you never dreamed I would leave first.</p>
<p>Huh? Just then, a bright light suddenly appeared on the distant sea. The outline of a destroyer slowly emerged. The ship&#x27;s guns were aimed at the speedboat. Ziao Tian whose laughter stopped abruptly and his face turned deathly pale. How? How come there are warships? The deputy pointed at the radar, his hand trembling.</p>
<p>Boss, boss, it&#x27;s a destroyer from Great Sa. It&#x27;s only three nautical miles away from us. Ziao Tinu suddenly grabbed his deputy&#x27;s collar. Hurry, speed up. Shake them off.</p>
<p>The speedboat&#x27;s engine roared to life, and it reached its top speed. But how could the destroyers possibly let them leave? The warships immediately began issuing warnings. Warning: Stop the ship immediately, otherwise we will attack. Ziao Tinhus face contorted as he shouted frantically, &quot;Don&#x27;t stop. Keep going.</p>
<p>They won&#x27;t dare to fire.&quot; The words had barely left his mouth. &quot;Bang!&quot; a loud bang! A column of water exploded on the sea next to the speedboat. Water splashed all over Zhiao Tianho. &quot;Boss! Boss! They&#x27;ve opened fire!&quot; The second in command was so frightened that he collapsed in the cabin. Ziao Tian who gritted his teeth as he watched the destroyer approaching.</p>
<p>Stop the ship. Stop the ship immediately. He knew that if he continued running, he would only be sunk. The speedboat slowly came to a stop. A small boat was launched from the destroyer and several naval soldiers jumped onto it.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t move. Hands behind your head. The soldiers, guns at the ready, shouted sternly. Ziao Tianhu and the others dared not resist and could only obediently raise their hands. They were taken aboard a destroyer.</p>
<p>The same situation. This happened all over the waters surrounding Dragonclaw Island. Because Dragonclaw Island is now under a no-fly zone, all planes on the island are unable to take off. Those traders could only leave by boat. However, the entire waters around Dragonclaw Island had already been blockaded by the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s navy.</p>
<p>Not even a mosquito can leave. With those leaders arrested on Dragonclaw Island, the various military bases also began to panic. The Frogman soldiers at the base were terrified and cried when they heard the news. The the leader has been captured. What should we do? What if they bomb us? No, we d better surrender.</p>
<p>The soldiers eyes were filled with panic. Just then, the voice of the great navy came over the loudspeaker. Listen up, garrison troops of Dragonclaw Island. Your leader has been captured. Any further resistance will only lead to your death.</p>
<p>You have 10 minutes to lay down your weapons and assemble at the training ground outside. Otherwise, we will launch an attack. I listened to the radio broadcast on a loop. The frogman soldiers were utterly desperate. An officer stepped forward and said through gritted teeth, &quot;Brothers, we have no way out.</p>
<p>Our leader has been captured, so there&#x27;s no point in resisting anymore. It would be better to lay down your weapons. Perhaps then you can save your life.&quot; The other soldiers nodded in agreement. Yes, we surrender. We don&#x27;t want to die.</p>
<p>10 minutes later on Dragonclaw Island laid down their weapons and surrendered. The traitorous soldiers lined up, hands behind their heads, squatting on the training ground, awaiting the processing by the Great Sea army. The Dasha paratroopers first landed at various military bases. An officer walked up to the soldiers and said sternly, &quot;From this moment forward, Dragonclaw Island will be under the control of the Great Sia military,&quot; &quot;Everyone stay where you are and don&#x27;t move.&quot; The Frogman soldiers dared not resist and could only obediently squat in place. The soldiers of the Great Sea began to take over the various strongholds on the island, one after another.</p>
<p>Not long after, the entire Dragonclaw Island was completely controlled by the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s army. Then an official announcement was made to the entire Dragonclaw Island. Residents on the island applauded the announcement. Yay! Finally, I don&#x27;t have to live in fear anymore. Those traitors must be severely punished.</p>
<p>They are the ones who made us suffer for so long. It&#x27;s wonderful. I can finally return to the embrace of my motherland. W I&#x27;m so excited. I can finally go back to pay respects to my ancestors.</p>
<p>Most of the islands residents were celebrating. They have waited too long for this day. Of course, a small number of people remain silent. This is not the result they wanted to see, but they don&#x27;t dare to cause trouble now, especially after learning that the sea of cherry blossoms had formed. These types of frogmen simply hide away.</p>
<p>Now, their only worry is being purged. Chapter 173, the great unification. At the same time, conference room at the military headquarters of the Great Sa Kingdom. After receiving the report from the frontline commander, the entire conference room erupted in excitement. Great, great, they&#x27;re all finally back.</p>
<p>General Ciangs voice trembled uncontrollably. Commander Lu, standing nearby, had tears in his eyes and said emotionally. Old Jang, &quot;We&#x27;ve been waiting for this day for decades.&quot; The other commanders all had red eyes. Only they themselves can understand their feelings at this moment. They&#x27;ve had this dream since the day they joined the army.</p>
<p>Today it finally came true. A moment later, General Jeang took a deep breath and wiped the moisture from the corners of his eyes. Pass the word down. Soldiers on the front lines, your merits shall be rewarded. In addition, a special task force will be established.</p>
<p>Thoroughly purge all those who committed crimes on Dragonclaw Island. Leave no one behind. Syaki Yuan Lin Shan was staring at the energy model of the lunar base. on the screen. The outline of the Guanghan Palace base gradually became clear.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo pushed open the door and rushed in, his face full of excitement. Kobayashi, good news. Dragonclaw Island has been completely recaptured. The traitors have all been captured. Really? Lin Chen&#x27;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s faster than I expected. Li Jang Guoo sat down on the sofa, still excited. Old Jeang and his men had already made all the arrangements. Dragonclaw Island doesn&#x27;t dare to resist at all. The entire Dragonclaw Island is now under our control.</p>
<p>Lynchin nodded. It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re back. Now we can focus on developing our businesses outside the region. Lie Jian Guo nodded. Yes, Dragonclaw Island has always been a thorn in the side of the people of the Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s finally solved. Oldly what&#x27;s next? Our focus should now be on developing lunar resources. Lynshan looked at the moon model, his eyes filled with determination. 300 p.m. The great Sia Kingdom officially issued a statement.</p>
<p>Dragonclaw Island returns. The motherland is reunited. 3-day national holiday to celebrate. The announcement has been released. It instantly ignited the entire Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>First, on the Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s internet, they were still celebrating the Cherry Blossom Sea event. After seeing this new announcement, nizens, let&#x27;s go crazy again. Holy crap. Mom quietly pulled off something big. V.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve finally waited for this day. Great. Today is absolutely a day of celebration for the whole world. Huh. We might actually be able to drive flying cars to the island for tourism by 2035.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s play good days. We must celebrate today. The entire internet went completely crazy. The trending topics on all websites and short video platforms were instantly replaced. on short video platforms.</p>
<p>Netzens shared photos of the celebrations. Firecrackers and fireworks were set off everywhere to celebrate. No one stopped them. Streets and alleys. Laughter and conversation filled the air.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re even discussing it on the subway and buses. Even the elderly women shopping at the vegetable market. They were all buying groceries and discussing things at the same time. Haha, Dragonclaw Island is back. I can go there to buy seafood now.</p>
<p>I heard the seafood is cheaper there. I wonder if it&#x27;s true. Some of the stall owners even chatted with the older women. At the same time, official accounts from around the world sent their blessings. The White House, congratulations on the unification of the great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>We look forward to more cooperation in the future. The South Korean presidential palace stated, &quot;The return of Dragonclaw Island is a historic moment. May the friendship between our two countries last forever.&quot; The Desert Tycoon Kingdom. The strength of the Great Sea Kingdom is admirable and we are ready to import more seafood from Dragonclaw Island. The European Union.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Great Sea Kingdom on the completion of its unification. We look forward to continuing our cooperation in the field of lunar exploration. Blessings came from every country on the entire planet Earth. It has the grandeur of a prosperous era where all nations pay tribute. Even international nizens have expressed their blessings.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the great Sia Kingdom. May the great SIA kingdom prosper forever. Great Sia Kingdom, you must open up immigration as soon as possible. Yes, we all want to be your citizens. Internationally, many people are still thinking about immigration.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom now offers excellent welfare benefits and it&#x27;s so powerful. It is the most ideal happy country in the minds of all foreigners. When nizens in the great sea kingdom saw these blessings, they laughed even harder. Huh? The US attitude is much more compliant than before. Is South Korea scared? They dared to argue with us about history before.</p>
<p>This country of tycoons is indeed pragmatic. They want to do seafood business with us. Now I finally understand the benefits of a strong country. Yes, this is true national strength and prosperity for the people. Netizens from the great Sia Kingdom expressed their feelings since the country&#x27;s technological explosion.</p>
<p>They deeply felt the changes brought about by this period of time. Regardless of the benefits and treatment received upon arrival from within the country or it&#x27;s about improving our international standing, all of this made them incredibly proud. 8:00 p.m. The pier on Dragonclaw Island. One by one, the street lights came on.</p>
<p>Residents spontaneously carried lanterns and strolled through the streets. An elderly man with white hair is holding an old photograph. The photo shows him and his comrades when they were young standing on the beach of Dragonclaw Island. Old friend, look, we&#x27;re going back. The young man next to him handed the old man a cup of hot tea.</p>
<p>Grandpa, I want to join the army in the future. Protect our motherland. The old man nodded with a smile, his eyes full of satisfaction. Military headquarters in the task force&#x27;s office. The light stayed on all night.</p>
<p>Staff members checked the list of offenders one by one on the computer. Ziaoin whose deputy was involved in three smuggling operations and also persecuted. The team leader picked up the phone, his tone serious. Notify the military to arrest everyone on the list. And those hiding overseas, send the list to those countries and tell them to hand them over within a day.</p>
<p>No matter where they hide, they must be brought back for trial. Clear. Those who betray their country will not escape punishment. No matter where they flee to, Siaki Yuan Lin Shun is still working overtime. On the screen, the energy system of the Guanhan Palace base has been successfully debugged.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo walked in carrying a cup of coffee. Xialin, it&#x27;s time to rest. Everyone&#x27;s celebrating outside. Aren&#x27;t you going to go see? Lynchin took the coffee and looked out the window. Fireworks burst in the sky above the distant streets, displaying a riot of colors.</p>
<p>No, there are still a few data points to check. He pointed to the lunar module model on the screen. We will begin developing lunar resources soon. There can be no negligence whatsoever. Looking at Lynch&#x27;s focused profile, Li Jang Guoo said softly.</p>
<p>With you here, we feel at ease. Lynch nodded and then focused his attention on the technology of lunar mining. In fact, he had always been thinking about that star stone. As long as we can mine the star stone, this will be of great help to the subsequent development of space cities and interstellar warships. So lunar development is urgently needed.</p>
<p>The star stone was mined and brought back a day earlier. Lynchin could rest assured a day sooner. Chapter 174. Mining the moon. In just one day, traders who were hiding in various countries before they were all exposed.</p>
<p>No country dared to delay. The following morning, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court of the Great Sea Kingdom. The individuals involved in the Dragonclaw Island case will be tried in open court. on the large screen outside the courtroom. The court proceedings were broadcast live.</p>
<p>Ziao Tinhu is guilty of smuggling, secession, and other crimes. He is sentenced to death for all these offenses. Former financial officer of Dragonclaw Island embezzled disaster relief funds. Sentenced to death. The core members of the separatist group are sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Each judgment is handed down. The viewers in the live stream applauded and cheered. Good. Well done. These parasites should have been dealt with long ago.</p>
<p>Watching the live court hearing got my blood pumping. The efficiency of the great SEA kingdom is truly remarkable. Support the country. Never let a traitor get away with it. With all the traders put on trial, the unification of the great Sia Kingdom has come to a perfect end.</p>
<p>10 days later, Syaki Yuan Lynchin stood in front of the giant screen. On the screen, the outline of the Guanghan Palace base is clearly visible. Silver white buildings spread out on the lunar surface. The nearby refinery glowed with a faint blue light. Li Jian Guo strode in holding a tablet in his hand.</p>
<p>Kobayashi. The lunar base and refinery are both ready for commissioning. The live streaming equipment is ready and waiting for your order. Lynch nodded, a hint of anticipation flashing in his eyes. Pass down the message.</p>
<p>Global live stream will begin at 10:00. Let the world see the lunar mining technology of the great Sia Kingdom. 10:00 a.m. The official platform of the Great Sia Kingdom. Start the live stream on time.</p>
<p>Once the live stream started, the number of viewers instantly exceeded 500 million. It&#x27;s here. It&#x27;s finally going to be live. I took a day off specifically to come see this, so please don&#x27;t let me down. Haha.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re finally going to start officially developing the moon. In the shot, the surface of the moon. 10 gray automated mining vehicles slowly started up. The vehicle is enormous with tire treads deeply embedded in lunar soil. The robotic arm lifted up flexibly.</p>
<p>Aim at a piece of or the size of a fist. Snap the or was precisely clamped then moved into the storage compartment at the rear of the vehicle. The whole process was smooth and seamless. In the live stream, netzens were instantly outraged. Holy crap, this automated mining truck is incredibly agile.</p>
<p>This robotic arm is more stable than my hand. I was worried about the difficulty of mining on the moon, but now it seems I was overthinking it. Camera angle change. Mining trucks deliver or to the refinery. The conveyor belt feeds the or into the machine.</p>
<p>The machine starts up. A pale blue energy light flashed by. A few minutes later, pieces of metallic material slid out of the exit. Data pops up on the screen. 99.99% purity titanium alloy.</p>
<p>100% rare earth element extraction rate. Helium three reserves are three times greater than expected. The moment I saw the data, the live stream went completely wild. My god, 99.99% purity. How is that possible? Helium 3.</p>
<p>We won&#x27;t have to worry about energy anymore. The great kingdom is awesome. I&#x27;m incredibly proud right now. Streets and alleys, whether it&#x27;s in front of a screen in a shopping mall or on a mobile phone, the people cheered. I knew it.</p>
<p>Our country can do it. Will we be able to use materials from the moon in the future? Definitely. Maybe in the future, cars and houses will even have lunar elements. Siaki Yuan seeing that everything was going smoothly. Lynch nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning. Next, there are more important things to do. At the same time, the White House of the US optin sat on the sofa. They stared intently at the live stream on the screen. The mining vehicles in the great Sia Kingdom are still in operation.</p>
<p>The coffee cup in his hand had long since gone cold. Pete stood to the side, barely daring to breathe. A long time passed. Optin slowly opened his mouth, his voice filled with resentment. The great SEA Kingdom actually did it.</p>
<p>Our moon landing program can be abandoned. Pete quickly stepped forward and said cautiously, &quot;Mr. President, how about we talk to NASA administrator Trudeau? Perhaps we can adjust our plans and land on Mars first. Optin paused for a few seconds, then nodded. Some endure it to see me immediately.</p>
<p>Even if we can&#x27;t reach the moon, we must conquer Mars. Half an hour later, NASA administrator Trudeau rushed to the scene. As soon as I entered, I could feel the oppressive atmosphere of Optton. &quot;Mr. President, you wanted to see me?&quot; Optin said calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;We can abandon our moon landing program. I don&#x27;t care what methods you use. You must come up with a Mars landing plan within 3 months. Otherwise, you can forget about being the bureau chief. Durit&#x27;s heart tightened and he quickly nodded.</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. President. I will come up with a solution as soon as possible. Watching Durit&#x27;s hurried departure often sighed. His eyes were filled with envy and jealousy.</p>
<p>Great Sia Kingdom, one day we will surpass you. Other countries, the reactions also varied. of South Korea. Park Quack Chong watched the live stream with a complicated expression. Has the technology of the Great Sea Kingdom already surpassed ours by such a great deal? The foreign minister nodded, his voice trembling.</p>
<p>Mr. President, how about we talk to the Great Sea Kingdom about cooperation again? Perhaps we can participate in the development of lunar resources. Park Coke. Chong was silent for a few seconds, then nodded. Arrange it immediately.</p>
<p>We must establish relations with the great SIA kingdom. Sarter&#x27;s rich country. The old king sat in the palace holding a jewel in his hand. Does the great Sia kingdom need funding for lunar mining? We can invest. Any amount is fine.</p>
<p>The minister of defense quickly responded. Syaki. After the live stream ended, Lie Jang Wo looked at Lin Shan with eyes full of satisfaction. Kobayashi, this mining operation was a huge success. The whole world is talking about our lunar program.</p>
<p>Lynchon, however, did not have it so easy. He took out a map of the moon and pointed to the backside. Mr. Lee, successful mining is only the first step. Next, the most important thing is to mine the star stones from the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos eyes lit up. Starstone? The one you mentioned before. Lynch nodded, his tone serious. That&#x27;s right. Starstones are of paramount importance to our great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>It must be mined as soon as possible. Li Jian Guo nodded emphatically. His expression also became serious. Salin, don&#x27;t worry. I will immediately arrange for relevant personnel to develop a detailed mining plan.</p>
<p>However, we don&#x27;t know much about the situation on the far side of the moon, and mining may be more difficult than on the near side. Lynn Shan frowned slightly, pondered for a moment, and then spoke. Don&#x27;t worry. I&#x27;ve already had someone develop a specially designed mining robot. Well definitely be able to mine the star stones easily then.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo immediately breathed a sigh of relief. That&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ll take care of the team formation. Lynchin looked at the crater on the map. A faint smile appeared at the corner of her lips.</p>
<p>Wait until we get the star stone. The interstellar era of the great Sea Kingdom is truly about to begin. Chapter 175. Sci-fi Southern Heavenly Gate. That evening, Lynch entered the inheritance space as usual.</p>
<p>After this period of effort, the transfer of unmanned planetary technology has finally been completed. A new technological legacy has been unlocked. Please select space carrier, space match, nearear space city, near-Earth space fortress, basic gene agent. Lynchan looked at the series of cuttingedge technologies being passed down, his eyes gleaming. Space-based carrier, space maps, near-Earth space city, near-ear space fortress.</p>
<p>Everything was what he wanted. But you can only choose one, especially when you see the final primary gene serum. This made Lynchin even more excited. They even have gene-enhancing drugs. I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same as in the movie.</p>
<p>Lynchin became increasingly itchy and restless as he looked at it, but I still held back. He also wanted to see everyone in the Great Sea Kingdom become like a dragon. But now the Great Sea Kingdom already has biological treatment drugs. In a short period of time, the people of the Great Sa Kingdom were no longer troubled by illness. As long as it&#x27;s not a physical death, a normal person can live to be 100.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom now needs to expand into outer space even more. Only by acquiring more resources. Only then can the Great Sa Kingdom develop faster. By then, if they inherit the gene-based drug, they might be able to develop it easily. Thinking about this, Lynchin had already made up his mind.</p>
<p>primary gene therapy technology. Let&#x27;s put it aside for now. But should we choose a space city, a space carrier, or a space mech? Lynshan is once again facing a difficult choice. A moment later, Lynch finally made a decision. I choose near-Earth space city technology.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. It still feels familiar. Successful selection of successor. Begin instilling the legacy. Lynn Shun felt a vast ocean-like flow of information rushing into his mind.</p>
<p>At that moment, his mind seemed to connect with the entire universe. Countless pieces of knowledge about the design, blueprints, construction techniques, material science, and operating principles of nearear space cities. They flashed through his mind like brilliant stars. Lynn Shan felt a throbbing pain in his head, but he endured the discomfort and tried his best to absorb this valuable knowledge. As time went on, the bloating and pain gradually subsided.</p>
<p>Instead, it brought an unprecedented sense of fulfillment. Lynchin slowly opened his eyes, his eyes sparkling with wisdom. He has completely mastered all the technical details of the nearear space city. Near Earth space city, this will be a significant step for the great Sia kingdom towards the universe. After Lynchin learned about the complete set of technologies for the space city, I&#x27;m certain that his choice this time was the right one.</p>
<p>Next, he went directly to the laboratory in the inheritance space to begin hands-on practice. He wants to optimize the near-Earth space city into an architectural style that conforms to the 32 heavens of ancient Chinese mythology. Thus, a sci-fi heavenly court will be created. This is a significant improvement over the original circular design. There are many things that need to be changed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the inheritance space is infinitely large. He can do whatever he wants. The entire space city includes living areas, entertainment areas, agricultural and livestock areas, as well as the space factory connected to the perimeter, but it&#x27;s all done in many steps. Initially, the south heavenly gate can be built first and then more can be added gradually later. After deciding on the design, Lin Shan then began to take action.</p>
<p>The Heritage Space Laboratory is fully equipped with all kinds of tools and materials. In addition, there has been some physical improvement during this period. In just one night, Lynn Shanun had already created the base for the sci-fi South Heavenly Gate. Looking at the magnificent and spectacular sci-fi inspired South Heaven Gate before me, Lynch&#x27;s eyes were filled with excitement. Excellent.</p>
<p>This is the space gateway that truly belongs to our great Sia Kingdom. Lynshan murmured to himself. Then his consciousness, then left the inheritance space. I got up and quickly washed up. We ate breakfast at the canteen of the Shaman Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Lyn Shan ordered five meat buns, a large glass of milk, and a plate of dumplings. Engineers who knew him greeted Lin Chan warmly. They were already used to the food in Lynch&#x27;s hands. During this period of time, Lynch&#x27;s appetite kept increasing. Anyway, the more I eat, the more I gain, and she hasn&#x27;t gained weight.</p>
<p>Just as Lin Shan was enjoying his meal. Suddenly, I heard a surprised voice from behind me. Old Lynn, is that you? Lynshin turned around and saw a familiar figure and was immediately pleasantly surprised. Fatty Wong, it really is you, Lynn. Oh no, now we should call him Chief Engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>After confirming that it was Lin Shan, Fatty Wong became a little reserved. Lyn Shins name was extremely wellknown at the Sia Academy of Sciences. Almost everyone knows it. After all, the projects he leads cover all fields. As long as they work at the Shaman Academy of Sciences, everyone knows Lin Chen&#x27;s name.</p>
<p>Some people have only heard of their names but have never actually met them. Seeing that Fatty Wong looked reserved, Lynchin joked, &quot;Fatty, do you want me to expose your embarrassing moments?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; Upon hearing this, Fatty Wong immediately became anxious and sat down opposite Lynchin. Then he exclaimed with emotion, &quot;Old Lynn, you&#x27;re still the same old Lynn.&quot; Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t even catch up with your heels. After he came to the Seyaku Academy, he achieved some success in laser weapon research. Laser guns have been successfully developed and are now in mass production.</p>
<p>He even participated in the later development of the quantum annihilation bomb. But compared to Lyn Shun, the gap is still too big because Lyn Shun is simply not human. Lyn Shun ate a steamed bun in one bite and laughed. Fatty, are you chasing my heels because you want to eat a fart? Actually, he was still grateful to the fat man if it is not for confidentiality purposes. He had already contacted Fatty a long time ago.</p>
<p>After all, the space for inheritance was obtained by swearing that the fat man would remain single for 50 years. The fat man was his benefactor. He had previously suggested to Lee Gian Guo that they expand recruitment of talent. It is also hoped that Fatty Wong will have the opportunity to work at the Syako Institute. Breathe the sigh of relief when he saw Lin Chin&#x27;s expression.</p>
<p>Old Lynn, you haven&#x27;t changed at all. It&#x27;s just that the changes you&#x27;ve brought to the great Sia Kingdom are too great. Sometimes it all makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a dream. Wong Ponzi expressed his heartfelt feelings. He had witnessed the changes that had taken place in the Great Sea Kingdom during this period.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x27;s a cancer cure or a life-saving drug, it has saved countless lives. Perhaps the star chariot will allow countless people in the Great Sea Kingdom to balance work and family life. And then there&#x27;s the groundbreaking quantum communication technology. This will usher in a new era for information transmission. Even quantum communication phones have developed virtual imaging technology.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong also bought the Starry Sky flying car and was one of the beneficiaries. Whenever he had free time, he would travel from the capital back to his home in Guangi Province to visit his parents. Now, flying cars can be seen everywhere in the entire Great Sea Kingdom. But there are still a large number of people waiting for the starship to be delivered. In particular, overseas orders are already booked for 5 years from now.</p>
<p>The great Sia kingdom thus made a fortune. Meanwhile, those traditional car companies abroad are already dead beyond repair. These are all real events and it&#x27;s all because of Lyn Shan that such a big change has occurred. Wong Ponzi had great respect for Lynch. Lynch smiled and said, &quot;All right, let&#x27;s not talk about such serious topics.</p>
<p>He Fatty Wong scratched the back of his head a little embarrassedly.&quot; Then the two chatted about everyday things while eating breakfast. After breakfast, Lynchin left in a hurry. He was going to talk to Lie Jian Guo about the approval of the science fiction project, Nanchiman. As for Fatty Wong, I&#x27;ll make it up to him when I have the chance. Chapter 176.</p>
<p>The great Xia Kingdom is invincible on Earth. Office of the Dean of the Academy of Sciences. Lyn Shan pushed open the door and entered. Lie Jian Guo was frowning as he looked at the data reports from the lunar base. Looking up and seeing Lin Shan, he immediately put down the documents.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. The mineral refining efficiency on the near side of the moon exceeded expectations, including the star stone on the far side. Before he could finish speaking, Lynchin smiled and placed the tablet computer in front of Li Jian Guo. Mr. Lee, take a look at this first.</p>
<p>Lie Jang Wos gaze shifted to the tablet computer and he froze instantly. On the screen, there was a sci-fi style design for the South Heavenly Gate. The more Lie Jian Guo looked, the more rapid his breathing became. Shaolin, are you planning to build a sci-fi version of the southern heavenly gate? Lynchin nodded. Not only that, after the South Heaven Gate is completed, it will be able to connect to the subsequent 32level space city.</p>
<p>From now on, it will be the space gateway of the great Sia Kingdom. Lie Jian Guo was overjoyed, exclaiming, &quot;Great, that&#x27;s wonderful. Can this project be approved? I&#x27;m here to ask you to approve my project.&quot; Without saying a word, Li Jian Guo picked up the phone. Immediately notify allademicians and core experts in various fields to assemble in the main conference room in half an hour. Half an hour later, conference room of the Seyaku Academy.</p>
<p>The projector displays the design drawings of the south heavenly gate. The previously noisy room instantly fell silent. This This is the entrance to the near-Earth space city. The design of the floating turret is amazing. My god, the energy conduction path of the base is simply a genius design.</p>
<p>Chief designer Lynn&#x27;s design is simply a stroke of genius. A cacophony of discussion erupted. It was all shock and excitement. No one questioned it anymore. After all, they had long been used to Lin Chin&#x27;s extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like it was at the beginning. Every time Lynshin proposed a technology, they would question it. Right now, I&#x27;m filled with nothing but shock and ecstasy. Next, Lynshin began his explanation. All the experts and missians continued to raise questions, but they all humbly sought advice.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the meeting was drawing to a close. Lie Jian Guo spoke again. I hereby declare the Nanchiman project officially established. Comrade Lin Shan remains the chief designer. All resources should be allocated.</p>
<p>The words had barely left his mouth. All the experts andmians expressed their support. Support chief designer Len. Huh. This time it&#x27;s our great SEA kingdom leading the way again.</p>
<p>Once the South heavenly gate is completed, the previous space station can be phased out. The meeting has ended. The project was officially established. Lie Jian Guo and Lynch left the meeting room. On the way, Lie Jian Guo suddenly suggested Shaolin, I think we can announce the establishment of the Nanchiman project so that the people can be happy too.</p>
<p>Okay. Lynshan nodded in agreement. Previously, projects were kept secret because of concerns about foreign interference. But now, the great Sia Kingdom is powerful enough. There&#x27;s absolutely no need to worry about any country daring to stand up and cause trouble, even if the news is made public.</p>
<p>Foreigners can only be envious. At the same time, Siaki Yuan Weapons Research Institute. Fatty Wong is looking at a set of data on quantum annihilation bombs. Just then, his team leader walked in, his voice a little excited. Wong Hao, the institute has just established a Nanchiman project.</p>
<p>The weapon systems will be handed over to our unit. We&#x27;re all on the list. The Nanchan project? Fatty Wong was taken aback for a moment, then asked with delight. Is the chief designer chief designer or chief designer Lynn? Absolutely, the team leader said proudly. At our Siako Institute, only chief engineer Lynn is qualified.</p>
<p>Okay, I knew it was him. Fatty Wong felt a mix of emotions. I just reunited with Lynchin this morning. As it turned out, only half a day had passed. Lynchin has come up with another new project.</p>
<p>Just hearing this name makes it sound incredibly cool. Nanchiman, that&#x27;s the entrance to heaven in the mythological classic Journey to the West. Wong Pongi was filled with amazement, and the magnificent scene involuntarily appeared in his mind. Fortunately, he was able to participate this time. This time, I will definitely work hard and strive to contribute to the weapon system of Nanchiman.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong secretly cheered himself up. On the other side, the official website of the Seyaku Academy released an announcement regarding the establishment of the Nanchiman project. This immediately caused an uproar throughout the entire Great Sea Kingdom. Holy crap, wasn&#x27;t the lunar base just completed? Are they preparing to build a space city? Amazing. My country, even science fiction enthusiasts have emerged.</p>
<p>Awesome. The South Heavenly Gate project is established. Does that mean there will be a science fiction heavenly court next? Definitely. Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to live in heaven someday. Huh? The people of the entire Great Sea Kingdom were filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>The South Heavenly Gate and the Heavenly Court are familiar to almost every citizen of the Great Sia Kingdom from childhood. These are beings from myths and legends. Now, it&#x27;s about to become a reality in the space of the Great Sa Kingdom. How could one not be thrilled? While the entire great sea kingdom was in a state of boiling excitement, the situation is quite different internationally. I saw that the great sea kingdom had established the Nanchamin project.</p>
<p>International nizens immediately erupted in discussion. It&#x27;s over. The great sea kingdom not only wants to occupy the moon, but now it wants to occupy space, too. God, go and punish the Great Sia Kingdom. Make them stop provoking us.</p>
<p>Damn it. We&#x27;re still struggling on Earth and the Great Sia Kingdom is already starting an interstellar war. Sigh. The US shouldn&#x27;t have allowed Great Sea to develop in the first place. Now it&#x27;s too late.</p>
<p>Many foreign nizens are filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred towards the current Great Sea Kingdom. Many condemn the United States, saying that it should never have allowed the Great Sia Kingdom to rise in the first place. Now it&#x27;s all good. The sleeping dragon has awakened. The great Sia kingdom, this behemoth of the east, is now unstoppable, completely invincible on Earth.</p>
<p>At the same time, different countries around the world have reacted differently. Eagle Optin is holding a meeting with Durit and others regarding the Mars mission project. The meeting was only halfway through. Suddenly, I heard the news that the Great Sa Kingdom had established the South Heavenly Gate project. This made Optin feel terrible.</p>
<p>it&#x27;s the Great Sea Kingdom again. Can&#x27;t they just shut up for a bit? Optin unleashed a furious curse. He couldn&#x27;t understand it. Isn&#x27;t the great Sea Kingdom still mining lunar resources? Why did they suddenly establish this so-called South Heaven Gate project? Druid, explain to me what exactly is going on with the Great Sea Kingdom southeast heaven gate project. Durret looked utterly bewildered and frustrated.</p>
<p>How could he know what was going on? However, seeing Opton staring at him, he could only bite the bullet and explain. Mr. president. Judging from the name, it should be a near-Earth space project. Given the current technological level of the great SEA Kingdom, they estimate they will build a near-earth space city.</p>
<p>Near Earth space city, Optton was taken aback then his face darkened. Don&#x27;t they already have a space station? This the space station must be a bit outdated. Dur guessed and explained. Currently, whether it&#x27;s the International Space Station or the Tong Space Station of the Great Sea Kingdom, they were all pieced together from individual space capsules. Ultimately, they&#x27;re just a bunch of rat traps.</p>
<p>With the current strength of the Great Sa Kingdom, it&#x27;s estimated that they also want to have a real space city. Upon hearing this, Optin fell silent. After a moment, he slowly spoke. Regardless of what happens to the Great Sa Kingdom, we must accelerate the Mars project. No matter what, we must gain the upper hand on Mars.</p>
<p>Chapter 177. The Great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s territory expands dramatically. Prime Minister&#x27;s Office of the Three Arab countries. Demo. The Immortal stared at the analysis report of the Great Sa Kingdoms South Heavenly Gate project.</p>
<p>The Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s Nanchiman project is actually a near-earth space city. His furrowed brows and gloomy face proved that old immortal demo was extremely angry. The high-ranking Indian officials around them all lowered their heads. At times like this, no one dares to speak up. Nobody wants to be used as a punching bag by Demo the Immortal.</p>
<p>After a moment, Demo the Immortals&#x27;s anger subsided slightly before he slowly spoke. Tell me your thoughts. Are we really going to give up on space exploration? From India looked at each other in bewilderment. They didn&#x27;t know how to answer that question. Giving up space development is tantamount to giving up India&#x27;s future.</p>
<p>But now the great sea kingdom is so powerful. Developing space exploration will inevitably lead to conflict with the great sea kingdom. If the great sea kingdom holds a grudge against us, their Indian country is the thought of the consequences sent chills down their spines. Demo the immortal observed everyone&#x27;s reactions. His face grew even more somber just as he was about to start cursing.</p>
<p>A cautious voice rang out. Prime Minister, perhaps we could go directly to develop Mars. Upon hearing this, old immortal demo paused for a moment. &quot;You mean developing Mars?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; the executive explained, raising his voice slightly. &quot;We have lost hope in near-Earth space and the moon.</p>
<p>But Mars is different. The Great Sa Kingdom currently has no projects to develop Mars. As long as we land on Mars before the Great Sea Kingdom,&quot; other senior executives echoed this sentiment. &quot;Mr. President, I believe that developing Mars is our best option at present.</p>
<p>Yes, let&#x27;s change our goal to developing Mars so we won&#x27;t provoke the great SA kingdom. Support the development of Mars. All senior executives agreed. After a few seconds of silence, Demo the Immortal nodded in agreement. All right, let&#x27;s begin the Mars mission.</p>
<p>With the full strength of the nation, we will strive to launch the first Mars probe spacecraft in 3 months. On the other side in the northern bear kingdom, the president looked at the territorial transfer documents in his hand, his eyes filled with complex emotions. The outer northeast will eventually have to be returned. The foreign minister stood to the side, his tone complex. Mr.</p>
<p>President, wouldn&#x27;t this be too unfair to us? Losing out. The president sneered and pointed to the design drawing of the South Heaven Gate on the screen. The space technology of the Great Sea Kingdom is already 10 times ahead of ours. Only by returning outer northeast China can we gain opportunities for cooperation. He paused, his eyes resolute.</p>
<p>Immediately allocate an additional 50 billion rubles to space research and development. We must keep up with the pace of the great Sia kingdom. The foreign minister nodded, but he understood in his heart. This isn&#x27;t cooperation. It&#x27;s clinging to someone powerful.</p>
<p>But for the future of the northern bear kingdom, this is the only way. Desert tycoon country region. the palace of the Sartra kingdom. The old kings eyes gleamed as he looked at the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s South Heavenly Gate project. He looked at the Minister of Commerce, his voice excited.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom has established the Nanchiman project. Can we purchase their space station? What? Buy a space station? The Minister of Commerce was completely dumbfounded. What&#x27;s going on here? Why would someone want to sell their perfectly good space station? That&#x27;s right. you should contact the great sea kingdom immediately and see if they&#x27;re interested in selling the space station. The price is negotiable.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to directly invest in the Nanchiman project, but the great SEA Kingdom would refuse. Therefore, they opted for a less desirable option to directly purchase the space station from the Great Sa Kingdom. As long as we buy back the space station of the Great Sa Kingdom, their kingdom of SAT is a nation that possesses a space station. At the same time, it can also cling to the powerful backer of the great Sia kingdom once again. The old king knew this very well.</p>
<p>As long as they keep sending money to the great Sia Kingdom, one day you will be richly rewarded. Outsiders all think he&#x27;s stupid. Actually, he was making a long-term investment. When the Great Sa Kingdom develops to a certain point, they certainly won&#x27;t be treated unfairly. The old king gave the order.</p>
<p>The Minister of Commerce had no choice but to contact the Great Sa Kingdom. The great SA kingdom was somewhat bewildered when it heard that the Sartra kingdom wanted to purchase a space station. After discussion, they finally agreed to sell it. The price is relatively cheap, sold 1 trillion. Even so, the Kingdom of Sat was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Ministry of Natural Resources of the Great Sa Kingdom. Staff are counting the newly returned territories. This includes the outer northeast of the Northern Bear Kingdom and the disputed area in the southwest region. They have all now returned to the great sea kingdom. Latest area statistics complete 13 million square kilm.</p>
<p>The statistician was immediately excited when he saw the final results. The entire office staff began to cheer. The minister reported this news. Soon of the great sea kingdom has once again released a piece of news that has shocked the world. Territory area update 13 million square kilm.</p>
<p>The announcement has been released. The entire internet instantly erupted in chaos. Holy crap, 13 million. That&#x27;s awesome. It has directly become the world&#x27;s number one country in the true sense.</p>
<p>Outer Northeast is back. It&#x27;s finally back. Haha, amazing. If Sakura Island were still around, it would probably be included in the whole thing. People celebrated by beating drums and gongs in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>In the square, children were jumping and skipping, holding up the national flag. The elderly sat on benches watching the news, their eyes filled with tears. to see our country become so powerful in this lifetime. It&#x27;s all worth it. On the international internet, netizens from all over the world are in an uproar.</p>
<p>An American nizen commented, &quot;13 million square kilm. Is the great sea kingdom going to rule the entire earth. European nizens, alas, the power of the great sea kingdom is something we can only look up to.&quot; A netzen from Australia commented, &quot;Luckily, we didn&#x27;t oppose the great sea kingdom. Otherwise, we wouldn&#x27;t even be able to protect our territory. South Korean nizens, they actually returned outer Manuria.</p>
<p>Is North Korea admitting defeat? In the comments section, voices of envy, jealousy, and fear were intertwined. No one dared to question the strength of the great Sia Kingdom anymore. Everyone understands that a new era has arrived. As for those countries on Earth, they all sent their blessings to the Great Sea Kingdom. No one dared to question it.</p>
<p>No one dared to condemn other countries that had returned territory. Some countries even wanted to be incorporated into the great sea kingdom because the welfare benefits in the great sea kingdom are just too good. They&#x27;ll be drooling over it. As long as it can be incorporated into the great sea kingdom, they can then become a part of the great sea kingdom. They can go from poverty and hardship to a happy life all at once.</p>
<p>Only their applications were all rejected by the great seia kingdom. At present, the focus of the Great Sia Kingdom is still on space development. As for other issues concerning Earth, there will be plenty of opportunities to resolve this later. The Great Sa Kingdom, a special training base. 30 team members dressed in silver white space combat suits are training around a speciallymade alloy target.</p>
<p>The lightsaber slashed across and the target instantly split in two. Final test passed. The instructor pressed the timer, his voice booming. They were all specially selected and received special training. The next step is to mine star stones on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>The final assessment is now underway. If we succeed, we can mine star stones on the far side of the moon. Chapter 178, mining star stones. I heard that I had passed the last assessment. The 30 special training team members immediately became excited.</p>
<p>Passed. We really made it. Teammate Chinfong hugged his teammate tightly, his voice trembling. The sweat stains on the back of the training uniform gleamed with salt under the light these past two weeks. 16 hours of high-intensity training every day.</p>
<p>Now there&#x27;s finally a result. Do you remember the first time you entered a zeroravity chamber? Team member Lea wiped the sweat from her forehead and joked with a smile. You threw up so much her mask was completely covered and you still insist you were just carick. Everyone burst into laughter. Hidden within their laughter was a bitterness only they understood.</p>
<p>Shinfong scratched his head and chuckled. He team leader Zhao Kai raised his hand to stop the laughter. Don&#x27;t be too happy yet. The environment on the far side of the moon is 10 times more dangerous than during training. But as long as we can bring the star stone back, we will be heroes of the great Sia.</p>
<p>30 people echoed in unison. For the great Sia. For the star stone. No matter how difficult it is, we must complete it. Their eyes were filled with determination.</p>
<p>Even at the cost of one&#x27;s life, they would spare no effort. These 30 specially trained personnel were all selected from the military. They were all top-notch military personnel. They were selected through multiple rounds of screening before they were able to come to this special training base from the day they entered the special training base. They had already disregarded life and death.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just waiting to complete the tasks assigned by the state. Siakiuan Lin Shu is busy with the Nanchamin project. Li Jian Guo came looking for him, his voice a little excited. Shaolin, the 30 special training team members have completed their training. All the specialized equipment for mining starstones on the far side of the moon is ready.</p>
<p>The starstone mining project can now be launched. Upon hearing this, Lin Chin&#x27;s eyes lit up. Everything&#x27;s ready. He had been waiting for this day for a long time. If we can mine the star stone back, this will also be of great help to the Nanchiman project.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo nodded and immediately agreed. Okay, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. Lynch and nodded, his eyes becoming deep. Once the starstone returns, the Nanchiman project can be accelerated. At that time, the space age of great sa will truly begin.</p>
<p>One day later, Kimping base, five Kuing space planes were parked side by side at the takeoff site. 30 miners dressed in upgraded space combat suits are in position. Check the equipment. Zhokai shouted into the communicator. Kimping system is functioning normally.</p>
<p>The robotic arm is operating normally. Quantum communication is normal. Each report was clearly transmitted to the command center. Kuan Pong one requesting takeoff. Zhokai&#x27;s calm voice came through the communicator.</p>
<p>Clearance for takeoff. Best of luck. Five space planes took off in succession. Soon it disappeared above the clouds. Soon the five coimping space planes reached near Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The miners looked out the port holes at the scenery outside. The Earth is like a blue gem. suspended in the darkness. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve seen Earth from space. It&#x27;s truly beautiful.</p>
<p>Lena&#x27;s voice was filled with amazement. Yes, we must protect Earth and prevent it from being harmed. That&#x27;s right. Earth will always be our ancestral planet. Even if we start interstellar warfare in the future, Earth will always be the best.</p>
<p>All the special forces members were filled with emotion. This was their first time flying into space. It was also the first time I had seen the blue planet from space. After the initial reflection, Captain Shun Fong solemnly ordered, &quot;Initiate acceleration. Target the moon.</p>
<p>Receive. The order has been issued.&quot; The Kuing Space plane began to accelerate. Mach 20, Mach 30, Mach 50, Mach 60, then find the direction of the moon. Fly straight to the moon. More than 3 hours later, five Kuening space planes landed directly on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>Captain Shinfong looked at the far side of the moon through the 3D visual radar, which was covered with craters, appearing desolate yet magnificent. &quot;Is that the Aken Basin?&quot; He pointed to a huge dark shape on the far side of the moon. Zhaokai nodded and pulled up the detailed data of the basin. With a diameter of 2,500 km, it is the largest impact crater on the moon. &quot;Our target is the starstone vein at the bottom of the pit.&quot; The spacecraft passed through lunar orbit.</p>
<p>As the distance closes, the details of the Aken basin are becoming increasingly clear. The rock straighta on the pit walls resembled boulders cleaved open by a giant. Occasionally, a faint blue light would flash through the shadows at the bottom of the pit. Prepare to enter landing trajectory. Zhokai&#x27;s voice became tense.</p>
<p>Beware of meteorite fragments. The five planes adjusted their attitude and slowly flew down to the bottom of the pit. The flames ejected from the thrusters left brief streaks of light in the darkness. A few minutes later, Kuong one landing smoothly. Kimping 2 landing smoothly.</p>
<p>Central Aken Basin. The hatches of the five space planes slowly opened. 30 miners were driving five specialized mining vehicles. It was directly released onto the lunar surface by the robotic arm of the Kuening spacecraft. The mining vehicle has large wheels with anti-slip treads that allow it to grip the lunar soil firmly.</p>
<p>The mechanical arms on the vehicle have been deployed, resembling a pair of giant steel arms. Is this the far side of the moon? Chinfong sat in the driver&#x27;s cab of a special mining vehicle. Experiencing the lowgravity environment filled me with curiosity. The other special forces members also looked like country bumpkins visiting a grand garden. Full of curiosity about everything.</p>
<p>The distant crater, like a giant tombstone, stands in the darkness. Only Earth&#x27;s light filtered through the edge of the moon, casting a faint glow. Lina raised the camera on her helmet and filmed her surroundings. I must show this video to my parents when I get back. Tell them I&#x27;m working on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>Zhaokai patted the two men on the shoulders and pointed to the mine ahead. Don&#x27;t waste time. Everyone, split up and keep in touch. The special forces soldiers immediately sprang into action. Five mining trucks drove off in different directions.</p>
<p>The wheels left deep tracks on the lunar soil. When the mining truck approaches the or vein, the detectors on the vehicle start to sound an alarm. Beep beep. High purity starstone detected. Meet mining standards.</p>
<p>Zhaokai&#x27;s eyes lit up and he immediately began to operate the robotic arm. Activate the special laser drill bit. A pale blue laser beam was emitted from the front end of the robotic arm. In an instant, a hole was drilled in the rock straighta. Pale blue powder slowly drifted out as the drill bit rotated.</p>
<p>Very good. Chinfong shouted excitedly. I&#x27;ve discovered a mineral vein here, too. Me, too. The excited voices of the team members came through the communicator.</p>
<p>Zhaokai watched as the robotic arm dug out a star stone the size of a basketball. The pale blue stone gleamed softly under the helmet light. Put the star stones into the storage compartment. Handle with care. Don&#x27;t damage it.</p>
<p>of the mining truck slowly opened. The robotic arm carefully placed the star stone inside. Pale blue stones were piled up like a small mountain inside the cabin. Chapter 179. The great Sia Kingdom becomes rich overnight.</p>
<p>Mining and exploration proceeded simultaneously. A few hours later, Chunfong and his team discovered that the reserves of starstone far exceeded their expectations. The estimated reserves of Star Stone have exceeded 50,000 tons with an average purity of 98.7%. Chunfong felt an overwhelming surge of excitement when he saw the data for his mining area. Great, we&#x27;re going to do something amazing this time.</p>
<p>The other team members also exclaimed in surprise, &quot;Holy crap, 50,000 tons and this is just from one region. It&#x27;s already 10 times more than originally predicted. Lina, stop just filming. Quickly measure the mineral vein over there. Okay, I&#x27;m testing it now.</p>
<p>Lena had barely finished responding when she exclaimed in surprise. My god, mine is over two, estimated at 5,000 tons. Next, the other team members sent out the data for their respective areas. These are all far beyond what was originally expected. The final tally came to a staggering 100,000 tons.</p>
<p>This is only the initial exploration. As the exploration continues, the data will certainly be updated continuously. But Chinfong couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. He immediately reported the current data to the ground command center. Report: The reserves of Star Stone have been discovered, far exceeding expectations, more than 20 times the predicted reserves.</p>
<p>Siakiuan Command Center. Upon receiving the message, I immediately reported it to Lie Jian Guo. Lie Jian Guo had just taken a sip of tea in the conference room. Upon hearing the news, he immediately got up to go find Lynchin. In Lynch&#x27;s office, he was writing the design proposal for 32 Heavens.</p>
<p>Then Lie Jian Guo came in looking very excited. Xialin, this is fantastic news. Lynch stopped typing, looked up, and smiled, asking, &quot;What good news has made you so excited, Mr. Lee? News has been received from the moon. The reserves of starstone have been detected, exceeding 100,000 tons.&quot; What? over 100,000 tons.</p>
<p>Lynchin stood up abruptly, completely shocked. Seeing Lynchin&#x27;s strong reaction, Li Jian Guo continued to explain. That&#x27;s right. This is only the initial exploration, and the reserves already exceed 100,000 tons. Once the precise detection results are available, there will likely be even more.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Lynn Chun was overjoyed. Huh, our great Sa Kingdom is going to make a fortune this time. more than 100,000 tons of star stones, which seems like a small amount. But what if we understand advanced civilizations in the universe? You&#x27;d realize how terrifying 100,000 tons of star stones must be. Those whose families are part of a level 5 cosmic civilization might have some understanding of this.</p>
<p>In the universe, even a 1,000 ton starstone vein is considered a rich mind. Once it appears, several level five or higher civilizations will compete for it. As for civilizations below level 5, they don&#x27;t even have the right to compete for it. This shows that starstone is incredibly rare in the universe. But now there are more than 100,000 tons of reserves on the moon.</p>
<p>If those advanced civilizations in the universe found out, they&#x27;re going to be snapped up like crazy. It could even lead to the annihilation of a large number of less advanced civilizations. Lynshan felt a chill run down his spine just thinking about the horrific scenes of allout wars that broke out among those advanced civilizations in the universe. Fortunately, the solar system is located in one of the most remote corners of the universe. No other civilization would even notice.</p>
<p>Unless the Earthlings themselves fly out of the solar system, otherwise other cosmic civilizations would never be able to locate the solar system. Lynchin made up his mind in his heart. We must ensure that the great sia kingdom survives until it reaches level three or four civilization in the solar system before considering leaving it. The matter of the star stone must also be kept completely secret. Even if you do use it, you should change the name.</p>
<p>The fewer people who know, the safer it is. Don&#x27;t flaunt your wealth. This is a wise saying at all times, especially in this universe full of unknowns and dangers. Li Jango was curious to see Lynch and so excited. unable to resist interrupting Lin Chen&#x27;s excitement.</p>
<p>Kobayashi, is it really that important that it exceeds 100,000 tons? In his view, it&#x27;s just 10 tons of or isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s not 1 billion tons. Is it really necessary to get this excited? Lynshin took a deep breath, calmed himself down, and explained seriously, elderly, all I can say is with these star stones, our great Sia kingdom already possesses the qualifications to upgrade to an advanced civilization. Moreover, the time will be significantly reduced. Upon hearing this, Li Jang Wos eyes widened in disbelief. What the qualification to advance to an advanced civilization in the universe? Just based on these star stones? Lynch nodded vigorously, his eyes revealing determination and confidence.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right, Mr. Lee. Stars are an extremely rare and precious resource in the universe. It is the hard currency of cosmic civilization playing a vital role in the development and upgrading of civilization. With these more than 100,000 tons of star stones, our great Sia will have a solid foundation to move towards a higher civilization.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Lie Jiano rubbed his hands together excitedly and muttered to himself, &quot;This this is absolutely fantastic news.&quot; Then he asked anxiously, &quot;Shaolin, what should we do next?&quot; Lynshin pondered for a moment and said, &quot;First, we must ensure that all the star stones are safely and secretly mined back. The fewer people who know about it, the better. Then we&#x27;ll find a place to seal most of the star stones away. Just keep a small portion for research. At present, the Great Sa Kingdom is not yet capable of processing star stones into energy blocks.</p>
<p>We can only mine it. We&#x27;ll preserve it for now. However, a small amount can also be set aside for research and use.&quot; Upon hearing this, Li Jang Wo solemnly assured him. Shaolin, don&#x27;t worry. Very few people know about the star stone.</p>
<p>I guarantee it won&#x27;t get out. Okay. Lynch nodded. Now, have the special mining team carefully collect every single star stone. Remember, it&#x27;s better to be slower than to miss a single star stone.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#x27;ll go arrange it right away. Lie Jian Guo responded briefly and then hurriedly left to make arrangements. Although he didn&#x27;t quite understand the ultimate purpose of the star stone, but judging from Lynch&#x27;s reaction, it must be extremely important. Otherwise, given Lynn Chen&#x27;s personality, there would absolutely not be such a strong reaction. After all, even something as significant as annihilating the Japanese invaders didn&#x27;t phase Lynch at all.</p>
<p>And now, it&#x27;s just 100,000 tons of starstone. Lynn Chan was overjoyed. Lie Jian Guo personally went to the command center to convey the order to Leo. At the same time, all staff members in the command center were required to sign a top secret confidentiality agreement. The staff at the command center were deeply shocked when they saw the top secret confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>But he didn&#x27;t dare ask any more questions and simply signed his name on the confidentiality agreement. They could have worked at the Kuan Ping base command center. Their family backgrounds have all undergone special investigations to ensure there are no problems. In this case, they even had to sign a top secret confidentiality agreement. It is clear that they have come into contact with certain matters concerning the fate of the nation.</p>
<p>All other personnel who knew about this mining mission signed a top secret confidentiality agreement. After doing all this, Lie Jian Guo immediately went to the South China Sea in Beijing. Report to that old man in the central government. Chapter 180. Warning.</p>
<p>Warning. Life signal detected. A mysterious office behind the mahogany desk. The old man was reviewing documents. The secretary gave prior notice and the door was gently pushed open.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guoo strode in looking somewhat restrained. The old man put down the documents and asked kindly, &quot;Director Lee, what&#x27;s the matter that&#x27;s making you so anxious?&quot; Lie Jian Guo walked to the table and respectfully reported, &quot;Boss, here&#x27;s what happened.&quot; He gave a detailed report on the reserves of the star stones and Linchen&#x27;s reaction. The old man&#x27;s eyes lit up immediately after hearing this. 100,000 tons. comrade Xiaoan Ataché&#x27;s great importance to this.</p>
<p>It seems this is a rare treasure. Although the old man did not formally meet Lynch, but I do know a little about Lynch. The fact that Lynshin attaches such importance to it is enough to prove the significance of the star stone. Lie Jian Guo continued to explain, &quot;Leader, according to Shiaolin, once our country possesses these star stones, it can rapidly advance its civilization level.&quot; Upon hearing this, the old man&#x27;s expression finally changed. I felt excited, gratified, and a little thrilled.</p>
<p>Good. Very good. Finally, it&#x27;s our great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s turn to obtain this heaven-deying opportunity. Seeing the old man&#x27;s reaction, Li Jang Guoo breathed a sigh of relief. He had initially worried that the old man wouldn&#x27;t take the matter so seriously.</p>
<p>But now, it seemed his worries were unnecessary. After a moment, the old man&#x27;s eyes regained their usual composure. Pass on my orders. The matter of the starstone is classified as top secret. Apart from those currently aware of it, it is forbidden to disseminate it to any non-essential personnel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all mining plans must be carried out according to Lin Chin&#x27;s requirements and all his demands must be met. Lie Jian Guo stood at attention and solemnly assured him. Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. After saying that, Li Jang Guoo turned around and prepared to leave. Just then, the old man&#x27;s gentle voice rang out again.</p>
<p>Wait. Li Jang Guoo turned around. Sir, is there anything else you need? The old man&#x27;s expression was serious. Please tell comrade Shaolin that he&#x27;s been working hard these past few days. Our great Xiao Kingdom owes its current status to his contributions.</p>
<p>After a while, the government will officially recognize his right to live. Li Jang Wos eyes instantly reened and he nodded emphatically. Don&#x27;t worry, sir. I will definitely convey your instructions. After saying that, Li Jang Guoo left excitedly.</p>
<p>He knows the government is definitely preparing to reveal Lin Chen&#x27;s identity. This also proves that the country is ready to face all international challenges. At the same time, the far side of the moon, the Aken Basin, Chunfong and his team are continuously collecting star stones. The mining truck&#x27;s robotic arm carefully transports the collected star stones to the truck&#x27;s storage compartment. Chunfong looked at the everinccreasing number of star stones in the storage compartment, his eyes filled with excitement.</p>
<p>He at this rate, we can finish harvesting in another 3 days. Brothers, keep mining. Let&#x27;s get back to deliver the mission as soon as possible. Excited voices from other team members could be heard over the communication channel. Brother Foam, when we get back this time, can we have a good drink together? Yes.</p>
<p>We need to relax properly when we get back this time. I wonder if I&#x27;ll get a secondass merit award this time. He all team members were filled with anticipation. Seeing how happy they were, Shinfong didn&#x27;t say anything to dampen their spirits. Just then, a call was received from the ground command center.</p>
<p>Calling Kuong Wan. Urgent order. Shunfong instantly wiped the smile off his face and replied seriously, &quot;This is Kuan Pung. Please give instructions. Attention all mining teams.</p>
<p>Please slow down your mining speed. We must collect them carefully and meticulously ensuring that we don&#x27;t miss a single star stone. In addition, expand the detection area and focus on investigating the area surrounding the mineral vein. Slow down. Chinfo was stunned and asked, &quot;Command center, has something happened?&quot; The command center responded sternly.</p>
<p>The specific reasons cannot be disclosed at this time. Just strictly follow the orders. The communicator was disconnected. All members of the special mining team fell silent. Lina was the first to raise the question, &quot;Why the sudden slowdown? Didn&#x27;t you say you wanted to start mining as soon as possible?&quot; Zhaokai frowned and pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;The importance of the star stone must have exceeded our expectations. There must be a reason why the command center made this arrangement.&quot; Shinfong took a deep breath, his eyes hardening. &quot;No matter what, obey orders. Search the mining area carefully. Don&#x27;t miss a single star stone.</p>
<p>at the same time set the detector to its highest sensitivity and carefully searched the surrounding area. Receive. Everyone echoed in agreement. The mining truck slowed down. The robotic arms movements became gentler as if it were carefully protecting a rare treasure.</p>
<p>2 hours later, Chinfo drove the mining truck to the edge of the vein. The detector on the screen suddenly emitted a beep beep notification sound. An unusual geological structure has been detected ahead. Chinfong immediately stopped the mining vehicle and operated the robotic arm to extend the probe. The probe penetrated deep into the lunar soil and transmitted real-time data.</p>
<p>Temperature- 196° C with a large amount of frozen layer present. The frozen layer. Chinfong was a little surprised. They actually dug into the lunar frozen layer. He also knew about the lunar ice layer.</p>
<p>Special training includes training on all the geographical environments of the moon. However, Shinfong did not expect to dig into the frozen layer so easily. He then immediately informed all the team members. Attention everyone, an ice layer has been discovered at the edge of the or vein. Zhaokai&#x27;s voice came through.</p>
<p>Brother Foam, I&#x27;m coming right away. A few minutes later, Zha Kai&#x27;s mining truck arrived. Two mining trucks were parked side by side above the frozen layer. The screen showed that the frozen layer was over 100 m thick. Something seems to be hidden beneath the ice.</p>
<p>Lina&#x27;s voice was filled with amazement. My goodness, the moon is amazing. The surface is all rock, but there&#x27;s a frozen layer underneath. Zhaokai operated the detector, emitting highfrequency sound waves. An image of ice appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Beneath the pale blue ice layer, some irregular structures can be vaguely seen. There seems to be something inside this ice. Chinfong leaned closer to the screen, examining it carefully. Could it be other minerals? It&#x27;s hard to say. Jokai shook his head.</p>
<p>The detector shows that the density of these structures is completely different from that of the star stone. Just then, sudden, the detector in Shinfangs cockpit emitted a sharp alarm. Warning, warning, unknown life signal detected. Unknown life signal detected. Red warning lights flashed in the cockpit.</p>
<p>Chunfong sat up abruptly, his eyes filled with shock. What? A life signal? He thought he had misheard. How could there possibly be life on the moon? Could there really be extraterrestrial life on the moon? The team chat instantly erupted in chaos. Brother Foam, what&#x27;s wrong on your end? Life signal? Is there something wrong with the detector? Or are there really aliens on the moon? Chapter 181. Discovery of lunar life.</p>
<p>After the initial shock, Chinfong immediately took emergency measures. Everyone, please move away from this area. After saying that, he immediately contacted the ground command center. Calling ground command center. Kuan Pung, one has encountered an emergency.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve received a life signal on the moon. Kuong base command center. Stunned when they received Chunfings message. What? Life signals discovered on the moon. Could it be the discovery of aliens? Staff member Shia Wong thought he had misheard and looked incredulous.</p>
<p>Old Zhao, who was standing nearby, quickly came over, looking shocked. Captain Shun, are you sure there&#x27;s really a life signal? Yes. Instantly, the entire command center was in complete chaos. Wow. Life on the moon has been discovered.</p>
<p>No way. The moon doesn&#x27;t even have an atmosphere. How could there be life there? Could it be a problem with the detector? They discussed it, but they didn&#x27;t slack off in the slightest. Call Li Jang Guo immediately. At the same time, Lie Jian Guo was returning to the Seyaku Academy in the starry sky flying car.</p>
<p>His phone suddenly vibrated and seeing the caller ID, he answered it immediately. What&#x27;s wrong? Why are you in such a panic? Dean Lee, Shinfangs team has detected life signals on the moon. What? What did you say? Say it again, Dean Lee. Shinfong just sent back a message. They&#x27;ve discovered a frozen layer in the mining area, and at the same time, life signals have been detected from within it.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Li Jang Wos mind went blank. The star stones haven&#x27;t been mined yet, and now lunar life has appeared. After the initial shock, he immediately took counter measures. immediately issue the order to Chin phone. Stop mining.</p>
<p>All team members, stay put. Protect the site. He hung up the phone. He immediately dialed Lin Chin&#x27;s number. Lynn Shun had just saved the design drawings for the 32 heavens.</p>
<p>The phone rang urgently. He picked it up and saw that it was Leian Guo calling, so he answered immediately. Kobayashi, something terrible has happened. Life signals have been detected on the moon. What? Life signals detected on the moon.</p>
<p>Lyn Shins eyes lit up with surprise. Life signals discovered on the far side of the moon. Could it be an alien civilization or were they indigenous life forms on the moon? This is going to be fun. Oldly I&#x27;m heading to the command center right now. After saying that, he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Then I went out and drove the starship directly to the command center. On the way, Lynn Chun was filled with excitement. Is this life an enemy or a friend? Will this affect the mining of star stones? Or perhaps it was the presence of stars that allowed life to emerge on the moon. Regardless of the type, both would be of great help to the biotechnology of the great sea kingdom. After all, life forms capable of surviving in the unique environment of the moon.</p>
<p>Its genetic evolution is definitely worth studying. As for extraterrestrial life, Lynshan had never even considered it. If it really is extraterrestrial life, those star stones had already been mined. It&#x27;s impossible to wait until now. The only possibility is that there are indigenous life forms on the moon.</p>
<p>5 minutes later, Lynn Shun arrived at the Kuan Pong base command center. Lyn Shun and Lie Jian Guo arrived at almost the same time. Kobayashi, you&#x27;ve come. Let&#x27;s go in and take a look. Lin Shun and Lie Jian Guo walked into the command center together.</p>
<p>Dean Lee, Chief Engineer Lynn, you&#x27;ve arrived. Director Lu, the head of the command center, quickly greeted them. Lin Shun waved his hand. Director Lu, take me to see the specific data. Okay, the data is here, Director Lu said as he led the way.</p>
<p>Soon they arrived in front of a large screen. The screen displays the life signal fluctuation data transmitted back by Chinfong. Lynchin observed carefully, his brows furrowing and then relaxing. After a moment, he slowly spoke. This data is real.</p>
<p>Really? Lie Jian Guo exclaimed in surprise. Director Lu and other staff at the command center were also shocked. The signal is actually real? Doesn&#x27;t that mean there really are aliens on the moon? I can&#x27;t wait. It would be so much fun if we could catch that alien. Well just subject them to the 10 most brutal tortures and have a proper discussion with them.</p>
<p>Lynch was speechless at the sight of their excitement. They showed absolutely no reverence for aliens. On the contrary, he looked excited. Don&#x27;t overthink it. This life signal definitely can&#x27;t be from aliens.</p>
<p>Most likely, it&#x27;s native life on the moon. Is it just native life? Li Jang Guo was a little disappointed. They&#x27;re not aliens. Native life on the moon. Wouldn&#x27;t that be the kind that hasn&#x27;t fully evolved yet? Could it be some kind of single-sellled life form? Other staff members were also disappointed.</p>
<p>After all, it&#x27;s not easy to hear about extraterrestrial life. They also wanted to see if aliens really existed in this world. The result was simply native life on the moon based on the lunar environment. If it&#x27;s just native life, it&#x27;s definitely the kind that hasn&#x27;t evolved much yet. That wouldn&#x27;t be fun at all.</p>
<p>Lynn Shan ignored the staff and issued new instructions directly. Director Lou, have the mining team continue mining the star stone. At the same time, have them find the source of that life signal, dig it out, and send it back to Earth for research. Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn. Director Lou replied respectfully.</p>
<p>Then they went to relay the instructions. The far side of the moon. After Chinfong finished his report, he waited anxiously. He was also feeling very uneasy. The other members of the team, on the contrary, were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to go and see if they encountered aliens. If Chinfong hadn&#x27;t stopped it, they started taking action a long time ago. Upon receiving the call from the ground command center, the connection was immediately established. Kuing one received, requesting instructions. The order to suspend mining has been cancelled.</p>
<p>Continue mining the star stones, but slow down. Chunfo was taken back for a moment, then quickly asked, &quot;The life signal? You&#x27;re in charge of the reconnaissance. Use the most sensitive detector to pinpoint the exact location and form of that life form. If it&#x27;s a relatively small creature, just mine the whole piece. Chunfo clenched his fist and shouted, &quot;Mission accomplished.&quot; The communicator was disconnected.</p>
<p>He turned to his team and shouted, &quot;Did you all hear that? Keep mining. Watch out for signs of life.&quot; Zhaok Kai&#x27;s eyes were full of excitement. Brother Foam, could these lunar life forms be aliens? Lina was also excited. If aliens existed, it would be so much fun to catch them and keep them as pets. Chinfong was speechless and sternly warned them.</p>
<p>Seriously, there can be no mistakes or we will be criminals against the country. Upon hearing this, everyone put away their playful attitude and responded seriously. Received. Mission accomplished. The mining truck restarted.</p>
<p>The robotic arm moves gently, carefully, avoiding areas of frozen ice. The indicator light on the detector kept flashing. Everyone held their breath, waiting to unveil the mystery of life on the moon. Chapter 182 successful capture of lunar life. Chinfong began operating the mining vehicle to increase the detection range.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the location of the life signal source was finally determined. It&#x27;s actually 50 m below the perafrost. You&#x27;ve kept it well hidden. He took a deep breath, suppressing his excitement. Start automatic digging.</p>
<p>Target 50 m below the perafrost. The instruction has been issued. The mining truck was making a loud roar. The robotic arm slowly adjusted its angle. A special drill bit extends, flashing a pale blue laser.</p>
<p>Begin digging. When the drill bit touches the ice surface, the frozen layer is cut into ice chips. The mechanical claw at the back directly transfers the ice shards to the rear. As excavation continues, the other team members also express their concern about the progress. Brother Foam, how&#x27;s it going? Did you find anything? Zhao Kais voice was full of anticipation and concern.</p>
<p>Shinfong stared intently at the screen and said irritably, we&#x27;ve only just started digging. It&#x27;s a long way off. Lena chimed in, a hint of mischievous anticipation in her voice. Could it be an alien monster? I&#x27;d love if it were furry. It&#x27;s in a woman&#x27;s nature to like furry things.</p>
<p>Even aliens are no exception. Lena even had the idea of keeping aliens as pets. Shinfong was speechless. Stop thinking nonsense. Focus on mining your star stones.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t miss any. He spoke seriously, but he was equally curious. What exactly is hidden beneath this layer of ice? The drill bit continued to descend. 10 m, 20 m, 30 m. With each meter, he went deeper.</p>
<p>Shinfangs heart beat faster. Inside the cockpit, there was only the faint sound of instruments running. Everyone held their breath as if afraid of disturbing the life beneath the ice. 40 m. The detector suddenly emitted a rapid beep sound.</p>
<p>Warning. Approaching signal source. Chinfong instantly became even more nervous. We&#x27;re only 10 m away from the location of the life signal source. At this point, the robotic arm moves even more gently.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like touching a fragile treasure. We&#x27;ll reach 50 m very soon. The drill bit suddenly felt lighter. It&#x27;s through. Chinfong immediately stopped drilling and switched to sampling mode.</p>
<p>A sampling claw extends from the end of the robotic arm. Slowly probe into the ice hole you just drilled out. A moment later, the sampling claw was retracted. It held a pale blue block of ice in its paws, measuring 50 cm. The detector indicated that the source of the life signal was at the center of the ice block.</p>
<p>We finally found it, Chunfong exclaimed, filled with excitement and anticipation. When the ice was retrieved back to the mining vehicle, Chinfong was dumbfounded again. What about life? What about the aliens? The entire block of ice was almost transparent. The entire block of ice can be seen through with the naked eye, but nothing was found if it weren&#x27;t for the detector constantly giving warnings. Chinfong thought they had dug the wrong hole.</p>
<p>It seems to be just some microorganisms. Chinfong secretly guessed what was going on, then operated the robotic arm to put the ice into a specially designed insulated box. Finally, it was placed directly into the storage compartment of the mining vehicle for safekeeping. After everything was done, Shan Fong finally breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Finally, the sampling is complete.&quot; The team chat was buzzing with inquiries.</p>
<p>Lina was the most excited. &quot;Brother Fong, did you dig one up? Is it an alien?&quot; Zhokai also asked anxiously. &quot;Brother Fo, quickly show us what the aliens look like.&quot; Chinfong explained helplessly. &quot;You&#x27;re overthinking it. It&#x27;s not some alien.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s probably just microorganisms or some other life form.&quot; &quot;What? Just microbial life?&quot; Lina was filled with disappointment. Zhaokai sighed. Alas, it seems our hopes of seeing aliens have been dashed once again. Chinfong ignored them and contacted the uniform center directly. Command center life signal sample has been obtained, requesting further instructions.</p>
<p>Ground command center. Looking at the transmitted images, Lynshin decisively gave the order. Arrange for a Kuwaning space plane to urgently send the samples back to Earth along with the first batch of starstones. The rest of you will continue to be responsible for mining the star stones. Yes.</p>
<p>Chenfong stood at attention and responded, then shouted to his teammates. Lina, Zhaokai, you two are responsible for sending the samples and stares back to Earth. The others continued mining. Receive. Lina and Zha Kai responded excitedly.</p>
<p>Then all the mining vehicles returned to the Kuing space plane landing point. All the star stones were gathered into the cargo hold of a Kuan Ping space plane, including that special piece of ice. The cargo hold closed slowly. Lina and Zha Kai returned to the cockpit of the space plane. Then the Kuing space plane is launched.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity plasma engine has started working. The Kuing space plane slowly ascended into the air, then accelerated away from lunar orbit. They sped off towards the direction of blue star. The tail flame left a dazzling trail of light in the darkness. After seeing Lin Na and Zha Kai take off successfully, Chinfong continued to give instructions.</p>
<p>Everyone, let&#x27;s go back to mining and try to complete the mission as soon as possible. 3 hours later, Blue Star, Great Sa Kingdom, Kimping Space Base. Lie Jian Guo and Lynchin stood side by side. Behind him was a group of biological scientists wearing white coats. Another team of emergency medical personnel was waiting nearby.</p>
<p>Everyone looked up at the sky. Their expressions a mixture of tension and anticipation. They&#x27;re here. A point of light appeared on the horizon. Enlarge rapidly.</p>
<p>Lina and Zhaok Kai&#x27;s Kuing space plane slowly and vertically landed on the ground. The hatch opened. Lina and Zha Kai quickly stepped off the Kuening space plane. Report. Lunar samples have been safely returned.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Wo stepped forward and said, &quot;Very good. You all go and rest first. Leave the rest to us.&quot; After saying that, the emergency medical staff took Lee Na and Joe Kai to the isolation area for examination. Next, Lie Jian Guo arranged for people to unload the star stones and the ice blocks containing lunar life samples. Xin, &quot;What do you think we should do?&quot; Lie Jian Guo approached Lyn Shun and asked excitedly.</p>
<p>Lynch nodded. Elderly, seal all the star stones and put them in the secure storage room. He paused for a moment, then continued. &quot;As for the life samples, give them directly to Professor Jeang and his team to take back to the Institute of Biology for immediate analysis.&quot; &quot;Okay, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away,&quot; Li Jian Guo said and went to make the arrangements. The lunar life samples were taken directly back to the biological research laboratory by Professor Jeang and his team.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, inside a biological research laboratory, all kinds of precision instruments were already prepared. Professor Jeang performed the procedure himself, placed the ice core into the thawing chamber. The temperature slowly rose and the ice gradually melted. All the scientists gathered around the screen. Professor Jean couldn&#x27;t help but ask Lyn Shun.</p>
<p>Chief engineer Lynn, &quot;What kind of creature do you think is here?&quot; Lynch shook his head. It&#x27;s impossible to be sure right now, but it&#x27;s very likely just cellular life. He wasn&#x27;t sure either, but even cellular life has very important research significance. Cells that can survive at minus200° C must have something unique about them. Just as Professor Jeang was about to say something more, then we heard the exclamations of the RD staff.</p>
<p>Look, cell structures have appeared. Everyone&#x27;s attention was focused on the large test screen. On the screen, tiny single cell structures emerge. Its appearance is simple, yet it is full of vitality. It&#x27;s a single-sellled life form.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s amazing. There really is life on the moon. Professor Jang and his colleagues were filled with curiosity, excitement, and anticipation. Professor Jang analyzed the gene sequence immediately. Lynchin ordered, &quot;Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn.&quot; Professor Jeang responded and then instructed the other RD staff to get to work.</p>
<p>A moment later, the results were in. Professor Ciangs voice trembled after seeing the final data. Its existence time is over 100,000 years. Terrifying. The entire room fell silent.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked by this number. Lynshin stared at the single-sellled life in the image, his eyes filled with excitement. The most primitive single-sellled organisms can survive for 100,000 years in the extreme environment of the moon. This is a miracle of life, Lie Jian Guo exclaimed in surprise. It&#x27;s truly baffling that a single-sellled organism can survive for so long.</p>
<p>This is more valuable than extraterrestrial life. Its cellular structure allows it to survive in vacuum, low temperature, and radiation. This vitality far surpasses that of any living organism on Earth. If we could crack its genetic code, Lynn Shin chimed in, his voice brimming with excitement. The life sciences of the great Sa Kingdom are about to experience an epic leap forward.</p>
<p>Chapter 183. It is the future of humanity. Throughout the laboratory, everyone stared in disbelief. They were all deeply shocked by the single-sellled life on the moon. What does it mean to have a single-sellled organism that can survive for 100,000 years? It has never appeared on Earth.</p>
<p>Currently, no long-ived animal on Earth has lived for more than a thousand years. The saying, &quot;A000-year-old tortoise, a 10,000-year-old turtle,&quot; is just a famous saying. But in reality, reality does not exist. Professor Jang remained in a state of shock, repeatedly muttering, &quot;100,000 years. 100,000 years.</p>
<p>Lynn Shin&#x27;s eyes were filled with excitement as he immediately issued a new order. Start full-scale testing immediately. I need to know all the data about it, including the cell wall, nucleus, and cytoplasm. Hearing Lynch&#x27;s excited voice, Professor Xiao and the others finally came to their senses. Okay, Chief Engineer Lynn, we&#x27;ll make the arrangements right away.</p>
<p>After Professor Jang and others responded excitedly, they got to work. Various testing instruments were started up. The ice in the thawing chamber has completely melted. The liquid containing single-sellled organisms is carefully drawn into the sampler by a robotic arm. The entire process is automated.</p>
<p>This is to prevent cross infection. Let&#x27;s start by analyzing the cell wall structure. Professor Jeang personally operated the state-of-the-art super magnification electron microscope. As the image is magnified, the details of the cell wall gradually become clear. A few seconds later, Professor Jeang suddenly exclaimed, &quot;My god, how is this possible?&quot; The crowd immediately gathered around.</p>
<p>On the screen, the cell walls appear as a complex network structure. Countless tiny crystal latises intertwine, shimmering with a pale blue luster. This is not an ordinary cell wall. Its structure is very stable and it is composed of some kind of unknown crystal able to survive at absolute zero and ultra high temperatures. This discovery undoubtedly overturned his understanding of biological science.</p>
<p>Having worked in life sciences for decades, this was the first time he had encountered such a miraculous life form. Upon hearing this, Lynch was also filled with curiosity. It&#x27;s actually made of crystals. This is getting more and more interesting. He was filled with curiosity about this single-sellled life form.</p>
<p>Although he possesses the legacy of a level 9 cosmic civilization, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever heard of such a life structure. He had heard of mechanical life forms. I&#x27;ve never heard of this structure before. Professor Jeang, continue observing its cell nucleus. Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>Professor Jang suppressed his excitement and continued the procedure. The image was magnified again. The cell nucleus appears directly on the large screen. When you see the structure of the cell nucleus, Professor Jeang exclaimed in surprise. This it&#x27;s actually a triple helix structure.</p>
<p>This once again overturned his understanding. All life on the entire blue star world is a double helix structure. Some scientists have also suggested that there are other biological cells with different structures in the world. However, this has never been confirmed and now it has been discovered on the moon. That&#x27;s amazing.</p>
<p>All the researchers around were filled with shock and excitement. Their eyes gleamed with a fervent desire to explore the unknown. Even Lee Gian Guo couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim in amazement, &quot;There really are such amazing creatures. The universe is truly incredible. Lynn Chins eyes were filled with excitement, and he suppressed his excitement as he gave the order.</p>
<p>Professor Jang, analyzed its gene sequence immediately. I need to know the secret of this triple helix. He had a suspicion in his mind. Perhaps this single-sellled organism will bring about an unprecedented change for humanity. We can only draw conclusions after all the analyses are completed.</p>
<p>Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn. I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. Professor Jang suppressed his excitement and continued to focus on his analysis. The same applies to other RD personnel. They all wanted to know the results as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Everyone was putting in a lot of effort following the actions of Professor Jeang and others. In addition, there is a foundation built on previous research and development of effective cancer drugs. A moment later, the test results are continuously displayed on the screen. A unique gene sequence has been discovered. No matching gene sequence was found on Earth.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this result, Lynshin realized that his suspicions had been confirmed. Very good. Continue testing in all extreme environments. Receive. Extreme environment testing begins.</p>
<p>Extreme high and low temperatures. Simulated cosmic radiation vacuum. After one round of experiments, the single-sellled life was still active. It can even maintain normal life metabolism at minus200°. It&#x27;s simply a miracle.</p>
<p>The most terrifying thing is that it can even absorb cosmic radiation and use it as energy to sustain its life. Outrageous. Absolutely outrageous. Professor Jeang was completely stunned when he saw the result. I have never seen such an outrageous life form.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s practically tailorade for space survival. If this ability could be transferred to humans, it&#x27;s so exciting just thinking about it. There is also a vacuum test. Single-sellled life forms are still thriving. It&#x27;s just entering a dormant state.</p>
<p>The final test results are now available. Everyone in the laboratory was completely shocked. Even Lynch is no exception. Lynch stared at the screen, lost in thought. The result was very close to his guess.</p>
<p>Now, we need to see how the genetic lock of this single-sellled life form allows it to adapt to so many terrifying and extreme environments. With that in mind, Lyn Shun continued to issue instructions. Professor Jeang, continue to crack its gene lock. I want to see how it remains active in extreme environments. This concerns humanity&#x27;s future space development relying solely on technology.</p>
<p>Given the current lifespan of humans, it would be difficult for them to secure a place in the universe. Many powerful cosmic civilizations have a lifespan that often starts at a thousand years. There are even many cosmic life forms with lifespans exceeding 10,000 years. It is precisely because of this that those races had the opportunity to evolve into advanced civilizations in the universe. Therefore, human lifespan must be extended.</p>
<p>Lynchin originally planned to inherit the gene-based drug technology and then gradually increase human lifespan. But now, the mysterious life on the moon has shown him a different direction. While Lynchin was pondering, Professor Jang and his team have begun working to unlock the genetic code of single-sellled life on the moon. At first, I was a little unsure where to start. But with Lin Chin&#x27;s constant guidance, Professor Jang and his team quickly found a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The experience gained from genetically modifying super fagasites has finally come in handy. As the cracks continue to be solved, the expressions on Professor Xiangs and the others faces became increasingly interesting. &quot;This is impossible. You can actually do that? How can there be such an amazing genetic lock?&quot; Professor Jeang and others repeatedly exclaimed in shock. Soon after, they finally discovered the special characteristics of the mysterious single-sellled life gene lock.</p>
<p>Special gene fragment discovered. These genes encode some kind of protective mechanism. It can induce a state of suspended animation in cells under extreme conditions. Professor Jeang leaned closer for a closer look, his voice excited. Look here.</p>
<p>These gene fragments can repair themselves. Even if the DNA is damaged, it can be quickly restored. The laboratory was a buzz with excitement once again. Self-repair gene. Wouldn&#x27;t that be immortality? Chapter 184.</p>
<p>Phoenix Rebirth. Genetic engineering. Self-repair. This This means immortality. Professor Ciangs voice trembled.</p>
<p>He could hardly believe his eyes. Not entirely. A strange light flashed in Linchen&#x27;s eyes, but it does have a near-perfect cell repair mechanism. Even if the DNA is damaged, it can be restored to its original state in a very short time. The more he spoke, the more excited he became.</p>
<p>If we could crack this mechanism and apply it to the human genome. Lynch paused, then looked around at everyone. Human lifespan will no longer be a 100red years, but a thousand years or even longer. The entire audience erupted in uproar. A thousand-year lifespan or even longer.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that be longer than a turtle&#x27;s life? Is this the path to immortality? Professor Jeang and the others had a look of madness in their eyes. No one can resist the temptation to extend their lifespan. Even if immortality is impossible, living for several more decades would drive people crazy. The average life expectancy in the Great Sa Kingdom is currently over 70 years. But many people who live to that time are plagued by illness.</p>
<p>There are now effective drugs for cancer. There is no longer any need to worry about illness or pain. If it could increase lifespan, I estimate everyone would go crazy for it. Even if they are scientists, they are no exception. Lie Jian Guoo jumped to his feet, staring at Lyn Shun in shock.</p>
<p>Little Lynn, are you saying we might achieve immortality? Immortality is definitely impossible. Lynn Shan shook his head. But before Lin Shan could continue explaining, Professor Jang and the others were filled with disappointment. Ah, is immortality impossible. Alas, it was all for nothing.</p>
<p>It seems we were overthinking it. The engineers were disappointed when they heard Lin Chin&#x27;s denial. Lynshin smiled at their reactions. I haven&#x27;t even finished speaking yet. Why are you in such a hurry? Chief Engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>Is there any other possibility? Professor Jang exclaimed with delight once again. Lynshan nodded slightly and continued to explain. Immortality is definitely impossible. But we can increase human lifespan and enhance human survival ability in various harsh environments through genetic modification. These things should still have a chance of being achieved.</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, Professor Jeang was overjoyed. It&#x27;s good that it can increase lifespan. It seems it still has some use. Lie Jian Guo chimed in. Yes, if we could raise the average human lifespan to 100 years, that would be an incredible achievement for humanity.</p>
<p>The other engineers nodded in agreement. Now, they have also abandoned the unrealistic fantasy of immortality. In fact, it could increase the average human lifespan to 100 years. For humanity, this is already an enormous contribution. Upon seeing them, Lynchin couldn&#x27;t help but explain, &quot;As long as we make breakthroughs in gene technology, a 100 years is definitely not enough, and even a thousand years is not a dream.&quot; After saying that, he looked at Li Jang Guoo and continued to propose, &quot;Oldly, I suggest that we directly establish a brand new genetic engineering project.</p>
<p>How about we call it Phoenix Rebirth Genetic Engineering? What do you think?&quot; Li Jang Guoo stood frozen in place, his chest heaving. He seemed to see a future where every citizen of the great Sia dynasty was like a dragon soaring through the stars. I agree, he practically shouted. This project must be implemented immediately. Professor Jang excitedly chimed in.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn, I&#x27;m applying to join. Even if I don&#x27;t sleep, I&#x27;m going to get this project done. Other researchers also responded, &quot;I&#x27;ll join, too. Count me in. It&#x27;s all worth it to be able to participate in a project like this in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Inside the laboratory, the atmosphere was electric. A flame burned in everyone&#x27;s eyes. That is the desire to explore the unknown and the sense of mission to advance civilization. Lynchin looked at everyone, a warm feeling welling up inside him. He looked at Li Jang Guo, signaling him to make the final decision.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guoo immediately understood and announced with a serious expression since no one has any objections. Then I hereby officially announced the establishment of the Phoenix Rebirth Genetic Engineering Project today. Kobayashi remains the chief designer. Professor Jang, you are in charge of gene analysis and biomimetic reconstruction. I&#x27;ll take charge of resource allocation.</p>
<p>Everything will be resolved as a priority. Yes. Everyone responded excitedly in unison. Then Lin Shun and Professor Jang and others went straight into work. Li Jian Guo was going back to report this news.</p>
<p>Although the higher-ups had already approved all the projects Lyn Shan needed to establish, but once the project is established, it still needs to be reported. South China Sea, Beijing. After receiving a phone call from Lie Jian Guo, the elderly man calmly responded, &quot;Let comrade Xan go ahead and do it. The country is his strongest support. We will provide whatever you need to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>We want to usher in an era where everyone in the great Sia dynasty can become like a dragon and truly reach for the stars and the sea. Lie Jian Guo gripped the phone tightly, his eyes slightly moist. Please rest assured, sir. I will definitely tell and I will live up to the leader expectations. After hanging up the phone, Lie Jang Wos eyes were full of excitement.</p>
<p>With such strong emphasis from leadership, the Phoenix Gene Project must succeed. Even if we can&#x27;t develop a gene serum that can extend lifespan by a thousand years, we also need to develop gene therapy agents that can extend lifespan to 100 years. On the other side, Institute of Biology Linshin has officially started working. He began to assign tasks to the team. Now, the first thing we need to do, it&#x27;s not about immediately modifying human genes.</p>
<p>Instead, we should first figure out how this cell survived for more than 100,000 years in the extreme environment of the moon. As they were talking, Lynchin suddenly thought of the star stone. The location where the lunar single cell was discovered was in the frozen layer beneath the starstone vein. Frozen layers have been explored in other parts of the moon before, but life has never been found there. Therefore, Lynshin suspected that there was some connection between them.</p>
<p>Just then, Lie Jian Guo returned to the laboratory. Shaolin, the boss has given you the order to go all out and develop a gene-based drug that can increase human lifespan. Lynch nodded. Oldly, you&#x27;ve come at the perfect time. Please have someone fetch a small piece of starstone from the warehouse.</p>
<p>We need to conduct cross experiments. Starstone? What does it have to do with that? Li Jang Wo asked somewhat puzzled. Lynchin explained earnestly. After hearing this, Li Jaguan no longer hesitated. Okay, I&#x27;ll go get it myself.</p>
<p>All the star stones have been sealed away. Currently, only a few people have the authority to allocate resources. Lie Jian Guo was one of them. This secrecy will be maintained until it is widely used. After Li Jang Guo left, Professor Jang finally couldn&#x27;t help but ask, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, are you saying that it might be because of the star stone that it&#x27;s like this?&quot; Lynch&#x27;s expression was serious.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to say. It&#x27;s just speculation at the moment. Everything will have to wait for the actual verification results to be confirmed. He couldn&#x27;t guarantee it either. This is just speculation at the moment.</p>
<p>Once the starstone arrives, we&#x27;ll know the results after testing. Chapter 185. The connection between star stones and lunar life. Half an hour later. Returned with a sealed lead box.</p>
<p>Salin, I brought the things back. Lynshin immediately ordered, &quot;Okay, Professor Jeang, arrange for someone to analyze it right away.&quot; After saying that, he added with a touch of unease. Remember, place it in a completely sealed space. Let the robotic arm automatically open the box and then transfer it to the instrument for testing and analysis. Since the star stone was brought back from the moon, it has been kept in a sealed storage state.</p>
<p>Nobody knows if there will be other radiation infections. Everything must be done with caution to prevent any accidents from happening. Professor Jeang nodded seriously, then instructed the engineer to operate according to the requirements. Soon, the sealed box containing the starstone was sent to the fully enclosed analysis room. Then the engineer remotely operated the robotic arm to open the box and the pale blue starstone lay quietly inside.</p>
<p>It seemed to be radiating a soft and mysterious glow. Engineers operate robotic arms to remove starstones the size of a fingernail. Immediately everyone&#x27;s attention was focused on the star stone. Is that a starstone? Professor Jeang was full of curiosity. Everyone in the lab has signed a top secret confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no need to worry about leaks. Other engineers had the same reaction. Lynn Shan, on the contrary, appeared calm and composed. He already knew what the star stone looked like from his inherited memories. Although it was the first time I had seen the actual product, I didn&#x27;t show the same level of surprise as others.</p>
<p>He immediately gave the order. Start the test. Activate the energy sensor and scan for energy fluctuations in the starstone. Receive. The engineer responded and then began to operate.</p>
<p>The instrument starts up and emits a low beep. On the screen, energy ripples slowly appeared. The frequency is stable and the energy retention rate is 100%. No abnormal radiation was detected. Upon seeing this result, Lie Gian Guo exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>It can actually store 100% of the energy. Such a level of energy conservation is simply unheard of. It&#x27;s important to understand that even the most advanced energy storage devices on Earth are considered incredibly efficient if they can achieve a storage rate of 20%. And Starstone can achieve 100% accuracy. It&#x27;s simply incredible.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang and his colleagues are biological scientists and they don&#x27;t know much about this kind of data. Seeing Lie Jang Wos reaction, someone asked curiously, &quot;Dean Lee, is this storage rate impressive?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s more than amazing. It&#x27;s downright incredible.&quot; Lie Jian Guo exclaimed, then began to explain. After listening, Professor Jang and the others finally understood why Lie Jian Guo was so shocked. He couldn&#x27;t help but exclaim, &quot;It&#x27;s simply a marvel in the field of energy storage.&quot; Lynchin remained calm.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the current equipment in the great Sea Kingdom is simply unable to measure the final performance of the star stone. star stones which can be used to create universal currency energy blocks could not possibly only have this much energy storage capacity. Its potential far exceeds the measurement limits of current instruments. Moreover, it certainly has more than just the single function of making energy blocks. Otherwise, those advanced civilizations wouldn&#x27;t frequently engage in life or death wars over star.</p>
<p>A moment later, Lynn Shan continued to issue instructions, place the star stone into the lunar single cell culture dish, and observe the reaction of lunar single cell life. That&#x27;s the key question he wants to figure out. What mysterious connection exists between astral stones and lunar life? The engineer operated the robotic arm quickly and precisely. The star stone, radiating a mysterious luster, was slowly placed into a lunar single cell culture dish. Everyone&#x27;s eyes were fixed on the petri dish.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t dare to breathe loudly, afraid of missing any detail. The next second, an astonishing scene unfolded. The single cells in the previously dormant petri dish suddenly became active. It slowly approached the star stone, the lattice on the cell wall glowing faintly. It seemed to be absorbing energy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s absorbing the energy of the starstone. Professor Jeang exclaimed, &quot;How is this possible? All of this is truly amazing. Single-sellled organisms are able to actively absorb the energy of starstones. Lynchin also became excited. There really is a connection between them.</p>
<p>He guessed right again. Then, Professor Jeang exclaimed in surprise. Look at the reaction in the cell nucleus. The triple helix structure is rotating at an accelerated rate. Inside the laboratory, a collective gasp filled the air.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo muttered to himself. Starstone, it&#x27;s not just a cosmic currency. Is it also a catalyst for the evolution of life? Lynch&#x27;s eyes flashed with a sharp light. That&#x27;s right. I now suspect that the reason this kind of life could arise on the moon is it is precisely because of the existence of the star stone vein.</p>
<p>It provides not only energy for survival, but also the driving force for evolution. If we could understand this mechanism of energy and gene interaction, Lynchin paused, then his voice suddenly rose. Humans can not only survive in space for a long time, it can even evolve on its own. The entire room fell silent. Everyone was shocked by this possibility.</p>
<p>Active evolution that&#x27;s no longer about adapting to the environment, but transforming oneself and conquering the universe. Is this going to overturn the history of human evolution? Proactive evolution. If we can achieve this, humanity will truly take off. I never imagined that one day humans could evolve on their own. All the engineers were deeply impressed.</p>
<p>They are all engaged in life science research. It is understood that human evolution is a natural process that occurs slowly over a long period of time based on the environment. There has never been a precedent for actively intervening and accelerating evolution. A moment later, Lynchin directly announced the action development plan. Starting today, the Phoenix Rebirth Project will be divided into two directions.</p>
<p>continue to analyze the genetic locks of lunar cells and attempt to fuse them with human genes. Simultaneously conduct in-depth research on the transformation mechanism of starstone and life energy. We are about to embark on a path that no one has ever walked before. If completed, we humans will evolve into the most powerful race in the universe in the shortest possible time. But the process will be extremely arduous and lengthy.</p>
<p>Are you all ready? Ready. The crowd responded in unison, their momentum unstoppable. Nothing else matters. They were excited. Was the thought that humans could evolve into the most powerful race in the universe.</p>
<p>Although they didn&#x27;t know just how powerful the most powerful race in the universe really was. Just hearing the name gives one a sense of unparalleled power. It&#x27;s as if by achieving this goal, humanity can traverse countless light years and conquer the vast universe. It is conceivable that humanity could become the most powerful race in the universe. Professor Jang and the others were all incredibly excited.</p>
<p>Looking at the excited crowd, Lynchin made a decision in his heart. No matter what, we must lead the great nation into the depths of the universe to become the most powerful race in the universe. Chapter 186. Basic gene agent. Lynchin stood beside the control panel and turned to look at Professor Jeang.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang, we must carefully observe the changes in the cell wall lattice when a single cell absorbs energy and we cannot overlook any detail. Professor Jeang was staring at the microscope when he heard this and immediately nodded. Don&#x27;t worry, Chief Engineer Lynn. We have added three monitoring points. It&#x27;s this triple helix structure that&#x27;s still a bit tricky.</p>
<p>He frowned, his tone tinged with urgency. The spiral&#x27;s rotation speed increases each time it absorbs the energy of the star stone. but we haven&#x27;t figured out exactly which gene segment is at work yet. Lynchin walked to the screen and looked at the gene simulation diagram on it. After a moment, he pointed to one of the gene fragments and said, &quot;Professor Jeang, focus on gene fragment number 17.&quot; He paused, his eyes sharpening.</p>
<p>In addition, prepare three sets of control experiments. One set only adds starstone energy. One group was injected with only lunar single cell extracts. The last group a mix of both. I need to know whether evolution is driven by energy or whether the genes themselves have special activity.</p>
<p>Professor Xiangs eyes lit up and he slapped his thigh. That&#x27;s right. How come I didn&#x27;t think of a control experiment? Chief Engineer Lynn, your line of thinking makes perfect sense now? He turned and shouted to the engineer next to him. Shia Wong, prepare for the experiment immediately. The engineer responded and immediately began the operation.</p>
<p>Inside the laboratory, the robotic arm began to move slowly. The light from the starstone shines through the glass dome onto the petri dish. The subsequent experiments did not yield data in a short period of time. It wasn&#x27;t until after 7:00 p.m. Lynchin hadn&#x27;t even gotten the experimental results he wanted yet, so he gave him a word of advice.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang, could you please keep an eye on things? Contact me immediately if anything happens. With eyes full of enthusiasm, instructor Jeang patted his chest and assured him. Chief Engineer Lynn, don&#x27;t worry. You can go back and rest. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on things.</p>
<p>Lynshan nodded and turned to leave the laboratory. He needed to hurry back to enter the inheritant space because the technological transfer of space city is about to be completed. Just one last step and we&#x27;ll be done unlocking new technological advancements. Back at the apartment, Lynn Shun threw his coat on the sofa. After a quick wash, I lay down on the bed and entered the inheritance space.</p>
<p>At this moment in the space of inheritance, a massive space city came into view. Ancient myths tell of the southern heavenly gate, the Ling Shao Palace, and the 32 heavens. Almost the entire heavenly palace has everything. Now we only need one more thing to meet the requirements for the inheritance space. Almost there.</p>
<p>Just one last step. Without further hesitation, Lynshin immediately proceeded to the final step of connecting the energy cycle. Following Lin Shen&#x27;s actions, the controlled nuclear fusion energy system was finally activated. It was as if the massive space city had been injected with life. The buildings began to shimmer with a mysterious light.</p>
<p>The equipment in the ancient mythological South Heaven Gate, Ling Sha Palace, and 32 heavens is all powered on. The air circulation system, energy circulation system, living area, working area, and research and development area are all fully integrated with the energy circulation system completely connected. The entire inheritance space trembled, and the space city seemed to come alive, exuding a majestic and awe inspiring aura. Lynchin knew he had succeeded. Detection indicates that the inheritor has completed the space city technology inheritance, unlocking new technology inheritance.</p>
<p>Please select complete technology for basic gene therapy. Space-based carrier technology, space mecha technology. Lynchin did not hesitate at all. Choose primary gene therapy technology. The words had barely left his mouth.</p>
<p>Countless streams of data flooded into his mind like a tidal wave. The structure of the gene chain and the ratio of drug components. Control of the activity of various enzymes. Scenes flashed before his eyes. Lynchin closed his eyes and carefully process this information.</p>
<p>Primary gene enhancing agents primarily function to unlock the body&#x27;s genetic potential, strengthen the body&#x27;s basic constitution and boost immunity. With normal human organs, a person can live up to 120 years. I see Lynch and opened his eyes, his eyes filled with excitement. Even a basic gene-enhancing drug can allow humans to live to an average age of 120. What if we incorporated the genes of single-sellled life on the moon? How much longer will it increase lifespan? Is it really possible to adapt to all kinds of extreme environments? And it can self-repair and autonomously evolve.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, Lynchin couldn&#x27;t wait to put it into practice. The space for inheritance contains experimental tools and materials. First, we need to optimize the formula of the primary gene drug to make it mass-producible in the Great Sea Kingdom. Then we&#x27;ll figure out a way to incorporate the genes of single-sellled life on the moon. Lynn Shan went directly to the inheritance space laboratory.</p>
<p>The laboratory has been transformed into a biological laboratory. Following Lynch&#x27;s ideas, various precision instruments are neatly arranged. The liquid in the reagent bottle shimmerred with different colors of light. Lynchin walked to the workbench and picked up a test tube. The excitement in my heart was hard to contain.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s begin. First, we&#x27;ll create basic rudimentary gene-based medicine. Then, Lin Shun conducted various experiments in the inheritance space. The primary gene serum contains many materials that are not found on Earth. We must find a similar material to replace it.</p>
<p>In particular, key materials for unlocking the human gene pool, a special kind of biological enzyme. It has never appeared on Earth before. Finding alternatives has become extremely difficult. Lynshin could only keep experimenting until the next morning. Match successful can replace raw materials.</p>
<p>Haha, I finally found it. Lynchin became excited when he saw the result. He tried at least 9,527,886 times throughout the night. He finally found a replacement. Solve the most difficult material substitution problem.</p>
<p>The rest became simple. Now, let&#x27;s go see if Professor Jang and his team have made any discoveries. Lyn Shun withdrew from the inheritance space. Quickly wash up. Then I went to the cafeteria for breakfast.</p>
<p>What a coincidence. Lynn Chun was eating a steamed bonwin. Then I heard that familiar voice coming from behind me. Old Lynn. He he.</p>
<p>What a coincidence. Immediately afterwards, Fatty Wong sat down opposite them with a plate of breakfast. Lynch had just swallowed a steamed bun when he glanced at Fatty Wong and joked with a smile. Fatty, you seem to have lost weight lately. Fatty Wong took a bite of breakfast, then looked like a wronged woman.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all because of the Nanchiman project you started. I&#x27;ve been working overtime until 2 or 3 in the morning every day lately. Oh, you participated too. Lynchin was a little surprised. Yes, I&#x27;ve been transferred to the defensive weapons project team.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re currently working on the final technical challenges and we expect to finish in about a week. Fatty Wong replied while eating. Good. Keep up the good work. We must make sure the defensive weapon system is well-developed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s our bridge head against alien civilizations. Lynshin spoke with an earnest and serious expression, his demeanor reminiscent of a certain scene. While eating breakfast, Fatty Wong suddenly said, &quot;Old Lynn, I just happened to have a design idea, and I&#x27;d like to ask you for advice. Tell me about it. It&#x27;s like this.&quot; Lyn Shin listened attentively to Fatty Wongs introduction.</p>
<p>In the end, he realized that Fatty Wongs idea was actually quite good. It could improve the performance of current space defense systems by 20%. Excellent. Your plan is very good. real? Okay, I&#x27;ll talk to your project manager later and asked them to adopt your proposal.</p>
<p>Haha, I knew I had talent. Fatty Wong became happy instantly after receiving Lin Chen&#x27;s affirmation. It should be noted that Lin Shun is now a recognized technical genius at the Siaku Academy. Gaining Lynch&#x27;s approval is definitely something to be very proud of. As for whether discussing technical issues in a public place like a cafeteria might lead to leaks of confidential information, it doesn&#x27;t exist at all.</p>
<p>As long as it&#x27;s within the Xyaku Academyy&#x27;s premises, it&#x27;s permitted. All staff members have undergone rigorous screening and signed confidentiality agreements. Next, Lynshin gave Wong Ponzi some technical guidance. Then, after saying goodbye, I headed to the biology lab. On the way, he casually made a phone call to Li Jian Guo, informed Fatty Wong about the optimization plan for the Nanchiman defense system.</p>
<p>Chapter 187. Cracking the gene lock of single-sellled organisms. on the other side. After hanging up the phone, Lie Jian Guo was filled with curiosity. Defense Weapons Project team Wong Lelay.</p>
<p>Why does this name sound familiar? Thinking about it, he started searching on the computer. The results came out quickly. Wong Lelay, Lin Chen&#x27;s roommate. Oh, it&#x27;s that chubby kid. When Lie Jian Guo saw the group photo in the file, he suddenly realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Those who can become Xin&#x27;s roommates are all truly talented. He knew from Lynchin&#x27;s brief description that Lynchin highly approved of the optimization plan. As for whether Lynchin pulled strings for Wong Lay, that&#x27;s absolutely impossible. He immediately dialed the phone number of the Nanchiman Defense Weapons Project team. In a serious tone, Lu Gene Long, there&#x27;s an engineer in your group named Wong Lelay.</p>
<p>He has a defense system optimization plan which your group will focus on reviewing. Remember, be meticulous. Don&#x27;t overlook any detail. On the other end of the phone, Lu Jin Long was staring at the defense parameters on the screen. Hearing Li Jang Wos words, he paused for a moment, then immediately agreed, &quot;Okay, Dean.&quot; After hanging up the phone, Lu Jin Long had some doubts.</p>
<p>The dean personally greeted him. Who is this Wong Lelay? The review process for the Nanchiman project has always been rigorous. I&#x27;ve never seen Deanly value a regular engineer&#x27;s proposal so much. He didn&#x27;t dare delay and immediately retrieved Wong Lays information. Wong Lelay.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s only been with the team for 3 months. He&#x27;s been doing an excellent job on the laser gun project. It&#x27;s all right. Looks like he&#x27;s a genius, too. He got up and stroed towards the office area.</p>
<p>Wong Lelay, come to my office. Wong Ponzi had just sat down at his desk when he heard his team leader call him. They&#x27;re here. He hurried over, his heart pounding. What does the team leader want with me? Did I do something wrong? Upon entering the office, Lu Jin Long pointed to the chair.</p>
<p>Sit down. I heard you have some ideas about the Nanchiman defense system. Upon hearing this, Fatty Wong excitedly explained. Team leader, this is what I&#x27;m thinking. After listening, Lu Jin Lones eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Who taught you the optimization approach to the energy circuit in your plan? Fatty Wong paused for a moment, then scratched his head. Nobody taught me. I figured it out myself. Lu Jin Longs eyes suddenly lit up. You figured it out yourself? No wonder Danley took it so seriously.</p>
<p>Next, Lu Jin Long began to inquire in detail about several key technical points. Fatty Wong gave perfect answers. Lu Jin Long became more and more excited as he listened, slamming his fist on the table. Good, good, lad. I never knew you were such a talent.</p>
<p>Now he can be sure. Fatty Wong is a rare talent in himself. It&#x27;s not the kind of thing where you get in through connections. Next, Lu Jin Long convened a project review meeting directly. The final review committee unanimously approved it.</p>
<p>Wong Panzi has become a rising star in the Nanchiman Defense Weapons Project team. On the other side, Biological Research Institute laboratory. Professor Jeang was hunched over the microscope, his eyes bloodshot. He had a layer of stubble on his chin, and there were traces of reagent on his clothes. The engineers nearby weren&#x27;t much better off.</p>
<p>Some were dozing off in their chairs, still holding data sheets in their hands. Some stared at the screen, not daring to blink. Suddenly, an engineer exclaimed, &quot;Professor Jeang, look.&quot; The break point in the gene chain matches up. Professor Jeang suddenly raised his head, his eyes instantly lighting up. He rushed to the screen, his fingers flying across the keyboard.</p>
<p>&quot;Try it again,&quot; stimulate it with the energy of the starstone and observe the reaction. The instrument emitted a beep sound on the screen. The triple helix structure slowly rotates. The previously broken gene fragments began to connect automatically. It&#x27;s done.</p>
<p>Professor Ciangs voice trembled and he almost burst into tears. I stayed up for three nights and tried hundreds of methods. We finally cracked that damn genetic lock. Just then, the laboratory door was pushed open. Lynch walked in.</p>
<p>He was stunned for a moment when he saw everyone&#x27;s expressions. Upon seeing Lyn Shan, Professor Jang excitedly reported, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, we&#x27;ve cracked it. We&#x27;ve cracked the genetic code of lunar single-sellled organisms. Really, Lynn Shun was instantly overjoyed. Only then did he notice the appearance of Professor Xiao and the others.</p>
<p>Their eyes were bloodshot and their hair was a mess. This shows that they must have stayed up all night last night. Just as Lin Shan was about to reprimand him, he heard Professor Jang continue his excited introduction. Chief Engineer Lynn, look, this gene fragment can remain active at minus200° C. It can also absorb cosmic radiation and convert it into energy.</p>
<p>Lynshin immediately focused his attention on the data. Looking at those data, his breathing gradually became rapid. This is exactly what he wanted. If it can be fused with gene-based drugs as soon as possible would definitely accelerate the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s progress towards space exploration by a significant margin. By then, the Great Sea Kingdom will enter an era where everyone is like a dragon.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Lynn Shan gave the order. Professor Jang, I have an idea for a gene therapy. Next, Lin Shan gave a brief oral explanation of the basic gene-based drug technology plan for the inheritant space. Because of the tight schedule, he hasn&#x27;t had time to write the copy on the computer yet. We can only offer some initial insights to Professor Jeang and his colleagues through verbal explanations.</p>
<p>After listening, Professor Jang and the others felt as if they had been enlightened. Impressive. Chief Engineer Lynn&#x27;s solutions are truly ingenious. It turns out we were all stuck in a dead end before. But after Chief Engineer Lynn&#x27;s explanation, everything became clear.</p>
<p>Great. Now we can start researching gene-based drugs. All the engineers were filled with excitement. Even Professor Jeang is no exception. There were many things I didn&#x27;t understand about genetic science before.</p>
<p>Lynn Shins explanation gave him a new perspective and direction. He looked at Lin Shan with excitement in his eyes. He desperately wanted to go up and crack open Lyn Shins head to see what was inside. It&#x27;s amazing that such an ingenious solution could be thought of. A moment later, Lynshan has already finished speaking.</p>
<p>Professor Jang and the others still seemed reluctant to leave. Lynshan ignored them and gave the order directly. Professor Jang, next you should conduct fusion tests on this gene fragment with human cells. Huh? Professor Jeang was a little surprised, then a little worried. Chief engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t it a bit too hasty to use human cells for experiments directly? How about we use other biological cells for our experiments first? Lynchin also felt that he had been a bit too hasty. All right, let&#x27;s use mice to do the experiment first. Professor Jeang nodded immediately. Okay, let&#x27;s begin right away. The engineers were instantly wide awake and full of energy.</p>
<p>They all began to divide up the tasks. The mice&#x27;s cells were quickly extracted. Engineers used a robotic arm to precisely place a test tube containing a single cell gene fragment from the moon onto a cultured dish of mouse cells, ready to inject. 3 2 1. The pale blue liquid was poured into the petri dish.</p>
<p>Everyone held their breath and stared at the screen. 1 second 2 seconds 3 seconds. Suddenly, the mouse cells in the petri dish began to fluctuate violently. The gene sequences on the screen have started to recombine. Success.</p>
<p>The fusion was a success. Chapter 188, A Miracle in Genetics. While everyone was in shock, the gene sequence map on the screen is already quietly changing. Upon witnessing this, Professor Jeang exclaimed in astonishment, &quot;It&#x27;s moving. It&#x27;s really recombinating its genes.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s evolving.&quot; By the end, his voice was trembling. And he was even becoming somewhat incoherent. He has been in the industry for over 40 years and has seen at least 800, if not a thousand, gene experiments. Never before had he felt his blood boil like this. The engineers in the lab were filled with awe and excitement.</p>
<p>The fatigue from staying up all night last night has long since disappeared. Lynshin stood at the back of the crowd and couldn&#x27;t help but smile. Looking at the recombined gene sequence on the screen, he was very happy. Genes from lunar single cells confuse with those of mouse cells. This proves that the compatibility of genes in lunar single-sellled life forms far exceeds expectations.</p>
<p>What about human cells? Is it possible to do that? The moment this thought popped into Lin Chen&#x27;s head, his eyes lit up. If it succeeds, humanity will be able to overcome the biggest hurdle in adapting to the space environment. He suppressed his excitement and interrupted the cheers in the laboratory. Everyone, please stop for a moment. Instantly, the entire laboratory fell silent.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at Lin Shan with excitement. Lynn Shan slowly began. Now let&#x27;s test the gene combination of the fused mouse cells. We need to investigate the stability of the recombinant gene, its environmental adaptability, and the degree of preservation of gene fragment activity, especially stability. If the gene chain is prone to breakage after fusion, everything else is just empty talk.</p>
<p>Professor Jang slapped his thigh somewhat excited. Chief Engineer Lynn is right. I was just too happy to think about it. Don&#x27;t just stand there. Get ready for testing immediately.</p>
<p>The order has been issued. The laboratory instantly sprang into action. The robotic arm restarted and carefully extracted a small number of fused cells from the culture dish. The instrument begins analysis. Time passed second by second.</p>
<p>The first result came out quickly. Upon seeing the data, Professor Xang exclaimed again. Chief engineer Lynn, the results are in. The fused gene chain is extremely stable. Look, after three consecutive sequencing runs, the arrangement of the gene fragments hasn&#x27;t changed at all.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s even more stable than a native cell. Lynch immediately looked at the results, which showed that the gene fragments had not changed at all and were even more stable than the original cells. This result also relieved Lin Chun. The environmental test results followed shortly after. Chief Engineer Lynn, the low temperature test has passed.</p>
<p>At minus200° C, the cells are still metabolizing normally. The radiation test has passed. Under simulated strong cosmic radiation, there was no damage to the DNA. High temperature test. My god, 150° C.</p>
<p>The cells only showed a slight decrease in activity. They didn&#x27;t die. Professor Jeang practically shouted it out by the end moment. The entire laboratory erupted in cheers. My god, it&#x27;s even fine in temperatures of 150° C.</p>
<p>It can even withstand cosmic radiation. If this were used on humans, going to space would be as easy as strolling in a park. Outrageous. This isn&#x27;t a biological cell. It&#x27;s almost like an alloy material.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang looked at Lynn Chun, his voice filled with shock. Chief Engineer Lynn, a miracle. This is absolutely a genetic miracle. The fuse cells not only retained the environmental adaptability of lunar single cells but also inherited the activity of mouse cells. More importantly, there was no rejection reaction between the two genes.</p>
<p>Lynchin couldn&#x27;t help but nod, his excitement barely contained. This result has exceeded my expectations. He looked at the petri dish, his eyes gleaming. Now we can move on to the next step. Professor Jang immediately pressed further.</p>
<p>The next step is a human cell experiments. Lynch shook his head. Let&#x27;s do experiments on live mice first. Success at the cellular level does not guarantee success at the living organism level. We need to confirm whether the fusion gene can be expressed normally in living organisms and whether it will actually lead to the evolution of living genes.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the most important thing. Only the live experiment was successful. That means the special genes of single-sellled life on the moon could also drive the evolution of human genes. Professor Jeang paused for a moment, then suddenly realized, &quot;That&#x27;s right. I was too hasty.</p>
<p>Live experiments are the key.&quot; He immediately turned to his team and shouted, &quot;Prepare live mice immediately. Inject them into the body according to the fusion protocol we just discussed. This time, we must be fully prepared and use all kinds of monitoring equipment.&quot; The engineers immediately sprang into action. Soon, several healthy mice were sent to the laboratory. Staff operated a robotic arm to carefully draw the fused gene fluid into a syringe, which was then precisely injected into the mice.</p>
<p>After the injection, the mice were placed in a specially designed observation box. The observation box is connected to various monitoring instruments, which can monitor the mouse&#x27;s heart rate, body temperature, and gene expression in real time. Everyone stood around the observation box staring intently. Even Lin Chun became nervous at this moment. The most crucial step is the live experiment with mice.</p>
<p>Whether it succeeds or not will affect the formulation of subsequent primary gene therapy drugs. He was just working on material substitution issues at the Heritage Space Lab last night. The fusion of specific genes has not yet been carried out. If the real world experiment is successful, this will allow him to do fewer experiments. The waiting time is always agonizing.</p>
<p>Almost every second felt like centuries. 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes. The mice initially scured around in the box, but quickly calmed down and looked no different from ordinary mice. Shia Wong stared intently at the monitoring screen. Heart rate normal, body temperature normal, gene expression has started.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang leaned closer and looked at the gene fragments that gradually lit up on the screen. Very good. The expression rate is very stable with no abnormal fluctuations. Time passed little by little. An hour later, old Lou and his team switched the observation box to low temperature mode.</p>
<p>The temperature inside the box dropped rapidly, quickly falling to minus 100° C. Everyone held their breath. At this temperature, a normal white mouse would die in less than 5 minutes. The white mouse in the observation box only curled up for a moment, but it was still slowly moving. &quot;It&#x27;s not dead, it&#x27;s still alive,&quot; Shiaolong shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang immediately ordered, &quot;Continue to lower the temperature. Lower it to -200° C.&quot; The temperature continued to drop. -50° C, - 180° C, -200° C. The air inside the observation box seemed to freeze. Although the mice moved more slowly, they still showed no signs of dying.</p>
<p>On the monitoring screen, its heart rate had decreased, but it was still within the normal range. My god, it really can withstand -200° C. Old L&#x27;s voice was filled with disbelief. What does -200° C mean? If a person were in this kind of environment, they would be frozen into an ice sculpture in less than a second. And now the mice are actually able to move around normally, even sci-fi movies wouldn&#x27;t dare to film something like this.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Lynchin finally felt relieved. Success at the cellular level has also been validated at the invivo level. Next, we need to expand the experiment to ensure the accuracy of the data. Chapter 189. Expanding the scope of the experiment.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang was still staring excitedly at the data on the screen, muttering to himself. Everything is surprisingly normal. Heart rate fluctuations did not exceed 4%. Most importantly, there was no rejection reaction, not even a little bit. I&#x27;ve been doing biological experiments for 30 years, and I&#x27;ve never seen such outrageous results.</p>
<p>Chief engineer Lynn, if this could be used on people. Before he could finish speaking, he choked up. Who wouldn&#x27;t want to witness the day when humanity breaks through its physiological limits? If humans can truly evolve to adapt to all kinds of extreme environments, let&#x27;s not even talk about going to outer space. Even just considering Earth, it could greatly improve the living environment for humankind. For example, in the perpetually frozen north and south poles, humans can live a normal life.</p>
<p>In addition, you don&#x27;t have to worry about heat stroke in the summer or getting cold in the winter. Just thinking about it is exciting. Lynchin looked at the excited Professor Jeang and smiled slightly. Professor Jeang, now is not the time to get excited. This is just a preliminary test.</p>
<p>I suggest further expanding the scope of the trial. In addition to increasing testing on mice, we also need to start testing on chimpanzees. At the same time, we will consider testing on humans only after the chimpanzeee tests are successful. Chimpanzees are the animals whose genes are most closely related to humans as long as it passes the test. Therefore, conducting subsequent human testing would significantly reduce the risks.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Professor Jeang immediately composed himself and readily agreed. Chief Engineer Lynn, don&#x27;t worry. We will definitely conduct the test strictly according to the requirements. He knew it in his heart. This kind of matter concerning the evolution of human genes is definitely not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>We must conduct the most comprehensive experiments. There can be no mistakes whatsoever. Otherwise, it would be a devastating blow to humanity. It would be troublesome if instead of developing a gene serum that would enable human self-evolution, we ended up creating something that would destroy humanity. The Japanese devils of the past are the best example.</p>
<p>After seeing Professor Xenangs response, Lynch nodded and continued to give instructions. Professor Jeang, while you are testing gene fusion, you should also study how to mass-roduce more single-sellled life forms on the moon. Didn&#x27;t it split up after absorbing the energy of the star stone before? You can start from this point. The current reserves of star stone are still quite considerable. If consuming a portion of it could make the great nation stronger, Lynshin would not hesitate.</p>
<p>However, this only applies to the Bactrin people. Even if gene optimizing drugs are developed by then, he would also impose restrictions on the genes of other races. Those who are not of our kind will surely have different hearts. Professor Xiao looked at Lynn Shun and assured him earnestly. Chief Engineer Lynn, don&#x27;t worry.</p>
<p>Everything will be arranged perfectly. He also knew that there were not many samples left to bring back from the moon. It may not be able to meet the needs of large-scale testing in the future. Therefore, artificially cultivating single-sellled life on the moon is also an urgent matter. The other engineers listened to Lin Chin&#x27;s instructions.</p>
<p>They all thought to themselves how thoughtful Lynch was. They were too excited and amazed to react. Lyn Shan, however, had already begun planning for the future. Perhaps this is the difference between people. As the ancients said, it is very difficult for people to earn money beyond their understanding.</p>
<p>Similarly, without reaching that level, it is impossible to control the overall situation. Lynn Shan, oblivious to the engineers changing emotions, continued making final arrangements. Old Jang, in a moment, put these experimental mice directly into the simulated space capsule for long-term testing. Pay close attention to the changes in their condition under continuous radiation. This is also the key to whether humans will be able to survive in space without wearing protective suits in the future.</p>
<p>Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn. Lynch nodded, then said, &quot;I&#x27;ll go back to my office first. If you need anything, just call me.&quot; After saying that, he left the laboratory. Professor Jang watched Lynch&#x27;s disappearing figure and then immediately began assigning tasks to the engineers. Lynch had just returned to his office and hadn&#x27;t even had a sip of tea yet.</p>
<p>As if he knew in advance, Li Jang Wo appeared directly in his office. He sat down directly in front of Lynn Shan, then asked expectantly, &quot;Lynn, how are the test results?&quot; Lynshin took a sip of tea, then slowly explained, &quot;The results far exceeded expectations.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; Li Jian Guo was instantly overjoyed. Lynchin smiled and briefly explained all the test results. Upon hearing this, Li Jian Guo became completely excited. This result is outrageous.</p>
<p>After hearing those experimental data, it was even more outrageous than what you see in science fiction movies. If it could actually be used on humans at that time, the Great Sa Kingdom will truly enter an era where everyone is like a dragon. The Great Sea Divine Dragon might not just be a dream. Ignoring Li Jang Wos shock, Lin Chun continued speaking, &quot;Oldly, there aren&#x27;t many test subjects left for Old Jang and his team. contact Chinfong on the moon and see if he can collect more ice blocks from single-sellled life forms on the moon.</p>
<p>Sure, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. Lie Jian Guo responded with one sentence and then hurriedly left. Lynchin also began to busy herself with her work. He needs to write out the detailed plan for the primary gene therapy. On the other side, NASA&#x27;s research and development center, recreation, and leisure room.</p>
<p>A celebration is underway. Chief of Staff Trudeau raised his champagne glass and shouted, &quot;Haha, today is a great day for our aerospace research and development bureau. We absolutely have to celebrate. Come on, let&#x27;s drink. Cheers.&quot; All the engineers raised their champagne glasses and drank them down in one gulp.</p>
<p>The reason they were so excited was it&#x27;s because their space engine has finally made a breakthrough. New technology could double the thrust of their space engines. The speed is also twice as fast as before. This means that their Mars project will soon be realized. Some engineers were so excited that their eyes welled up with tears.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#x27;ve broken through. Now we don&#x27;t have to be at the mercy of the Great Sa Kingdom anymore. Yes, I&#x27;ve been feeling really stifled lately. I don&#x27;t even dare to speak loudly. As long as we successfully land on Mars, the Great Sea Kingdom will still lag behind us.</p>
<p>It can only be said that they lived a dark and hopeless life during this period. Now we can finally see a glimmer of hope. The Great Sea Kingdom occupied the moon and their Eagle Alliance occupied Mars. By this calculation, the Eagle Alliance is still ahead of the Great Sia Kingdom. A moment later, Durit left first to report to Upton.</p>
<p>Eagle, the president&#x27;s office. Upton also went through a very difficult time during this period. It&#x27;s very distressing to see the great SIA kingdom making such rapid breakthroughs in the space field. They haven&#x27;t even fully understood the quantum chip from back then. Not to mention the advanced technologies such as anti-gravity later on.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t even do reverse engineering well. Damn it. Why has the great Sea Kingdom become so terrifying? Optin&#x27;s eyes were filled with resentment but also with helplessness. Just then, a knock was heard at the door followed by an assistant voice. President Chief Trudeau requests an audience.</p>
<p>Come in. Optin composed himself. After Trudeau came in, he reported the information about the aerospace engine diagrams. Upon hearing this, Optton instantly became excited. Great, that&#x27;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Immediately issue an announcement. In 6 months, our American Eagle will be landing on Mars. Chapter 190, the Crouching Dragon and the Young Phoenix combination. Upon hearing this, Trudeau&#x27;s expression changed drastically, and he quickly advised, &quot;Mr. President, we can&#x27;t land on Mars in 6 months.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to know that the distance between Earth and Mars is not constant. Instead, the distance between the two planets will vary greatly depending on their positions in their respective orbits. The closest distance is only 55 million km. The furthest distance reached a staggering 400 million km. The difference between the two is seven or eight times.</p>
<p>Their latest technological breakthrough can only achieve an interplanetary cruising speed of Mach 30. Even the shortest distance of 5,500 km would take 60 days to fly in a straight line. This is the ideal flight route. However, in actual space travel, it is impossible to fly in a straight line. He needs to consider factors such as gravitational boost and orbital insertion.</p>
<p>So, the actual flight time is often longer than the ideal straight line flight time. The fastest Mars probes launched by the United States took 6 to 9 months to reach Mars. Even if there is improvement now, it will still take 4 to 6 months. But the spaceship hasn&#x27;t even started building yet. How is it possible to land on Mars in 6 months? But Optton wouldn&#x27;t listen.</p>
<p>He stuck to his own ideas. Go and post the announcement first. As long as you can set off within 6 months, there will be no problem. He just wants to make empty promises to the people in his country. This is to alleviate the increasingly serious internal conflicts within their country.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he might not even live to see the change of leadership before he has to step down. After all, hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in research and development. It also brought together all the scientists from the entire Eagle Alliance. If they don&#x27;t produce some results, how can they explain themselves to the public? Seeing Optin&#x27;s unwavering resolve, Trudeau had no choice but to reluctantly agree to hold the press conference. Setting off 6 months later is barely acceptable.</p>
<p>He definitely couldn&#x27;t land on Mars within 6 months. But setting off 6 months later is a different story. An hour later, seen from a White House press conference, Durret held up the microphone, his voice booming. I hereby announce that the United States has officially launched its Mars colonization plan. We expect to conduct the first man landing on Mars in 6 months.</p>
<p>The words fell. The flash bulbs from the audience went off like crazy. However, the applause at the scene was sparse. Instead, they looked at Durit with more skeptical eyes. Some reporters even raised their hands to ask questions.</p>
<p>Chief Trudeau, according to publicly available data, the failure rate of your country&#x27;s space engines is still as high as 17%. How can you ensure the safety of the Mars mission? Dur&#x27;s face stiffened, but he forced himself to remain calm. We have solved all the technical problems, and the failure rate has been reduced to below 0.1%. These words immediately caused an uproar among the reporters in the audience. 0.1%.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not what they said when the rocket exploded last year. Last time they said it was absolutely safe and the launchpad exploded. The live broadcast of the press conference was filled with voices of doubt. Are you trying to fool us again? Wasn&#x27;t the lesson learned from the last man lunar landing enough? Exactly. Can&#x27;t we just focus on doing proper research? We no longer aspire to land on the moon or Mars.</p>
<p>We just hope you will stop provoking the great Sia Kingdom. Almost no one was willing to believe Dur&#x27;s words. Meanwhile, the American public is also worried that this press conference will provoke the Great Sya Kingdom. What if Great Sa then imposes sanctions on the US? Currently, the people of the United States are suffering greatly due to the situation in China. In the past, relying on so-called technology, they could reap the benefits of the entire world.</p>
<p>Now, all industries have been overturned by the Great Sea Kingdom. Their once proud high-tech industry has long been destroyed. This led to the collapse of almost all companies in the entire technology sector. Tesla, Pingua, Wwan, and Gaong are now just empty shells. Now all that&#x27;s left in the US are those farmers who are still alive and well.</p>
<p>Other industries have completely collapsed. The American people just want to live a quiet and peaceful life now. I don&#x27;t want to be noticed by the great Sia Kingdom anymore. White House. Optin&#x27;s blood pressure spiked as he watched the doubts raised in the live stream.</p>
<p>Everything went black and he fainted. The secretary immediately called for a doctor to provide emergency care. At the same time, the other side of the world, Prime Minister&#x27;s office of the three Arab countries. Demo, the old immortal, looked at the news about the United States. He immediately became unhappy.</p>
<p>Damn the US. They actually want to land on Mars before us. Dream on. This time, our India must be ahead of you. He suddenly stood up and shouted at his secretary.</p>
<p>Arrange a press conference immediately. Tell the world that India will land on Mars within 5 months. The secretary was stunned. Prime Minister, our space rockets haven&#x27;t even broken the second escape velocity yet. How can we land on Mars? Demo the immortal glared at him.</p>
<p>Are you stupid? Buy it from the great Sia Kingdom. They even have anti-gravity technology. So, what&#x27;s wrong with selling rocket technology? The secretary hesitated, but seeing the look in Demo&#x27;s eyes, she lowered her head and agreed. Yes, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. That afternoon, a press conference was held in India.</p>
<p>Demo the Immortal looked at the camera with a confident expression. Here, on behalf of India, I solemnly declare our Indian country will officially land on Mars in 5 months. At that time, our India will become the first country to send people to Mars to make outstanding contributions to the development of space exploration on Earth. Demo the immortal spoke with great enthusiasm as if they were certain of success. You know what demo lashians press conference on the contrary gained the trust and support of the Indian people.</p>
<p>However, the international community was absolutely in stitches. Har is India trying to compete with the US and who can boast the most. Go to Mars in 5 months. They haven&#x27;t even successfully recovered a lunar probe yet. They said they were going to build a space station, but 10 years have passed and they haven&#x27;t even built a single module.</p>
<p>Nizens in the great Sia Kingdom were absolutely thrilled. The US gets 6 months, India gets 5 months. Were these two supposed to have planned this together? The crouching dragon and the young phoenix. One makes grand promises, the other boasts. A perfect match.</p>
<p>I suggest they team up and go on a trip to Mars instead of embarrassing themselves on Earth. Let&#x27;s wait and see how India covers up this lie in 5 months. Some netizens even photoshopped the picture. On the left is a rocket model from the United States and on the right is a rocket modified from a tractor from India. Caption: The Martian duo.</p>
<p>Whoever gets there first is a dog. The moment the picture was released, it spread across the entire internet. Regarding the farce between the US and India, Lynchon laughed when he saw it. Are these two up to their comedy act again? Do the US and India still want to get their hands on Mars? This is simply a dream. Not to mention Mars.</p>
<p>All the planets in the entire solar system belong to the Great Sea Kingdom. No one can touch it. Otherwise, the outcome will be the same as that of Japan. Of course, Lynn Shun believed that neither of their countries would have this capability in the short term. It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re underestimating them, but their goal is to send people to Mars, something that other countries on Earth simply cannot achieve with their current technological capabilities.</p>
<p>The Great Sea Kingdom would be a good option, but Lynn Shun is not planning to explore Mars so soon. We&#x27;ll consider this issue after the moon has been largely developed. Now, his biggest concerns are the mining of star stones and how many single-sellled life forms exist on the moon. I wonder if Chin Fong and his team have discovered any more single-sellled life on the moon. Chapter 191.</p>
<p>Abundant single-cellular life on the moon. The far side of the moon. After receiving Li Jang Wos instructions, Chinfong immediately began issuing orders. Attention everyone, team one and team two, continue mining the star stones and proceed according to the original plan. Teams three and four, follow me and expand the search area.</p>
<p>Objective: to search for more life on the moon. After resting for one night, Zhaokai and Lin rushed back to the far side of the moon. There are still four fully staffed mining teams. Upon hearing the order, Zhaokai was instantly surprised. Brother Foam, has the ground team already analyzed what that mysterious lunar life is? Lina also looked shocked and surprised.</p>
<p>They must have already analyzed it. Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t be in such a hurry. Chunfong responded in a somewhat serious voice. Those are not things we can know. Our job is to search for more lunar life.</p>
<p>Understood, brother. Foam. Zhaokai and Lina dared not ask any more questions. The mining trucks of team one and team two continued to mine the star stone. The mining vehicles of teams three and four adjusted their directions.</p>
<p>The robotic arm retracted the drill bit and replaced it with a highfrequency detector. The pale blue probe waves swept across the ice surface, making a soft buzzing sound. Chinfong stared intently at the screen, his eyes filled with anticipation. Finding just one piece of ice containing life shocked the entire Sia Science Academy. if we could find more.</p>
<p>He dared not think any further, feeling as if his heart was about to leap out of his chest. Brother Foam, there&#x27;s a weak signal at 30° to the left. Suddenly, shouts came from the three teams. Chinfo was instantly delighted. Where? He steered the mining truck directly in that direction.</p>
<p>On the screen, the red dot representing a life signal is flashing, and the signal is stronger than before. Stop. The mining truck came to a smooth stop. The robotic arm carefully probed the frozen layer, and the special drill bit slowly descended. Ice shards flew everywhere, sparkling like broken diamonds under the search light.</p>
<p>5 m, 10 m, 15 m. Beep beep beep beep. The detector&#x27;s alarm suddenly became urgent. Shunfangs breathing instantly quickened with excitement. Found it again.</p>
<p>The robotic arm retracted the next second. holding a basketball-sized block of ice in its paws. The testing instrument displayed a dense array of red dots. Each red dot represents a single-sellled life form on the moon. We really found it.</p>
<p>The quantity is a 100 times that of last time. Chunfong shouted excitedly on the public channel. Really, brother Fong? You&#x27;re amazing. You dug up another one so quickly. Zhao Kai cheered excitedly in the public channel, his voice filled with barely suppressed excitement.</p>
<p>This number is simply astonishing. Lina&#x27;s eyes widened, her face full of surprise. If we bring this back, it will definitely lead to a major breakthrough in the research at the Sia Academy of Sciences. Suppressing his inner elation, Chun Foam shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t just stand there. Keep expanding the search.</p>
<p>There might be more.&quot; After saying that, he immediately contacted the ground command center. &quot;Gound command center, this is Kuen Pun 1. We discovered a large number of single-sellled life forms on the moon at a depth of 15 m in a frozen layer. The quantity is more than 100 times that of last time. Ground command center.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, staff member Shia Wongs eyes filled with excitement. Command center received. Please continue the probe. After saying this, Shia Wong immediately reported the news to his superiors. The news was quickly reported to Li Jang Guo.</p>
<p>more than a hundred times more than last time. Lie Jian Guo was instantly excited upon hearing the news. He immediately contacted Lynch. Kobayashi, good news. Shinfong has found a large number of single-sellled life forms on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>The quantity is 100 times that of last time or even more. Lynn Shun is currently writing an optimization plan for the primary gene drug. Upon hearing the news on the phone, I immediately stopped typing. Oldly, are you telling the truth? Is it a 100 times more than last time? That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s the information the command center just reported to me.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s absolutely no mistake. Are you sure it&#x27;s a single-sellled organism? Are there any other abnormalities? The feedback signal is the same as last time. There are no other abnormalities for the time being. Lie Jang Wos voice was full of excitement. Now we have enough samples for the gene fusion experiment.</p>
<p>Lynch was a little excited and immediately made arrangements. Great. Oldly immediately send five more data collection teams. We&#x27;ll go all the way to the far side of the moon to specifically collect single-sellled life forms. The more the better.</p>
<p>Li Jian Guo was stunned for a moment, then realized what was happening. Five teams. Isn&#x27;t that too many? What about the progress of the starstone mining? The stars can wait. Lynchin interrupted him, his tone incredibly firm. Right now, these single-sellled life forms are 10 times more important than the star stones.</p>
<p>Just imagine if we could crack their genetic code. Humans could adapt to the space environment. Then we can officially embark on our interstellar voyage. The star stones aren&#x27;t going anywhere on the moon. No one dares to steal them from us.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Li Jang Guoo felt it made sense. Okay, I&#x27;ll arrange it right away. However, the equipment for the five squads needs to be temporarily allocated, which may take 2 hours. Lynshan nodded, his tone softening somewhat. No problem.</p>
<p>Have chin foam and the others mark all the signal points first and don&#x27;t mind blindly. Tell the team members to be careful not to damage the samples. If the sample is damaged, subsequent experiments will be in trouble. After hanging up the phone, Lie Giani Guo immediately went to make arrangements. Immediately dispatch five collection teams equipped with cryogenic storage chambers.</p>
<p>Target the far side of the moon. Assist Chinfong in collecting single-sellled life. We must depart within 2 hours. Upon receiving the instructions, the relevant departments immediately began to take action. 2 hours later, five Kimping space planes took off again from the Kuing base.</p>
<p>This time, there are still five teams. The members were recruited from the reserve special mining team. They also underwent special training. The far side of the moon. Chinfong received the instructions from the ground and was also filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Brothers, headquarters is sending five more squads. Let&#x27;s mark all the signal points first and wait for the main force. Zhaokais voice immediately came through full of excitement. Brother Foam, we&#x27;re going to do something amazing this time. Lena chimed in.</p>
<p>Maybe we can even find more amazing life forms. Chinfo responded with a smile. Don&#x27;t think too much. Let&#x27;s focus on doing the job at hand well. Turn the detectors up to maximum.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t miss an inch of ice. The mining truck started up again. Search lights swept across the ice, leaving streaks of light. On the detector&#x27;s screen, more and more red dots appeared like a twinkling starry sky. Chunfong stared at the screen, a smile involuntarily creeping onto his lips.</p>
<p>He touched the photo in his pocket. It was his daughter&#x27;s smiling face. Girl, daddy will soon be able to send humans into space. When the time comes, Dad will take you to the moon to see Chonga. Suddenly, the detector&#x27;s alarm sounded again.</p>
<p>This time, the sound was more urgent than before. Chinfangs smile froze instantly. On the screen, a huge red that was flashing, stronger than all the previous signals combined. This is chapter 192, special life forms grouped together. What&#x27;s this? Chinfangs eyes were filled with surprise.</p>
<p>Hearing Chunfangs exclamation, Zhokai quickly asked, &quot;Brother Foam, what&#x27;s wrong? Is something wrong?&quot; Lina followed up with, &quot;Have you discovered any unusual extraterrestrial life?&quot; Shinfong didn&#x27;t have time to answer. His hands flew across the control panel. The mining vehicle&#x27;s detection power was turned up to the maximum. The probe signal penetrates the ice layer, capturing detailed signal feedback from within. Only then did Chin Foam realize what was going on.</p>
<p>It turned out to be hundreds of lunar single-sellled life forms gathered together. This caused the abnormal feedback of the detection signal. So that&#x27;s all it was. What a false alarm. Chun Phone breathed a sigh of relief, then explained in the public channel.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, everyone. We&#x27;ve just discovered clusters of lunar life. That&#x27;s good. Zhaokai breathed a sigh of relief. So, they&#x27;re just a bunch of lunar life forms.</p>
<p>Lena&#x27;s voice carried a hint of disappointment. The other team members also relaxed. Chunfangs exclamation startled them, making them think that some emergency had occurred. Chin phone ignored them and directly controlled the mining vehicle to start mining the special ice block. The robotic arm retracts the detector and replaces it with a special sampling claw.</p>
<p>The alloy shell of the sampling claw gleamed with a cold light. Under the search light, it looked like a giant steel pinser ready to pounce. The robotic arm slowly extends. Little by little, they probed deeper into the ice. 1 meter, 2 m, 3 m.</p>
<p>With each meter he went down, Shunfangs heart beat a fraction faster. The red dot on the screen became clearer and clearer. It was as if something was waiting for them beneath the ice. Soon after, the special block of ice was removed. It&#x27;s about the size of a basketball.</p>
<p>At this point, the detection signal feedback became even stronger, densely packed with red dots. Each red dot represents a single-sellled life form on the moon. That&#x27;s amazing. There are so many lunar life forms gathered together. How did they do it? And what are they trying to do? Chinfong was very curious about this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they are not scientists and cannot analyze this situation. They can only report back to the ground command center. Let the scientists at the Seyaku Academy analyze it. But he knew that this time he was going to make a great contribution again. Brother Foam, how&#x27;s it going? Did you find anything? Zhaokai&#x27;s voice came again, full of urgency.</p>
<p>Chunf grinned and opened the public chat. Found it. It&#x27;s even bigger than the last one. There are countless single-sellled organisms inside. Real? Zhao Kai and Lea exclaimed in unison, their voices filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Chinfong didn&#x27;t delay. He immediately switched channels and contacted the ground command center. Ground command center. This is Kuen Pun. We have detected an abnormal signal source.</p>
<p>Successfully collected a special ice block. The number of single-sellled life forms inside far exceeds that before. Ground command center. Upon receiving the news, Shiaol Wong jumped up instantly. Ground command center received.</p>
<p>I will report to my superiors now. Please wait for the next instruction. After Shiaol Wong finished speaking, he immediately reported to his superiors. The news quickly reached Liian Guo special ice blocks converging a large number of single-sellled life forms. When Lie Jian Guo heard this news, Li Jang Guoo was waiting for news in his office and instantly became excited.</p>
<p>Then he immediately issued an order to the command center. Have Chin Fong arranged for someone to send that special ice block back immediately. After making the arrangements, he immediately went to find Lin Shan. This matter must be told to Lin Shun. It&#x27;s possible that those special ice blocks might be of particular help to Lin Shan and his team&#x27;s research on gene-based drugs.</p>
<p>The far side of the moon. After receiving instructions from the ground, Shinfong immediately made arrangements. Zhaokai, Lina, you all immediately pilot the Kuan Ping 2 and send this block of ice back. Hurry up. Upon hearing this, Zhaok Kai and Lina instantly became excited.</p>
<p>Receive. Mission accomplished. The two quickly drove the mining vehicle to the landing point of Kuan Ping 2. The robotic arm carefully moved the storage box into the cargo hold. The hatch closed slowly.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity engine is started. the tail flame of Kuan Pong. Two streaked across the lunar night sky. They sped off towards the direction of Blue Star. Chinfong watched the spaceship disappear into the distance, his heart filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this time we can make an even bigger discovery. Then he turned around and continued to direct his team to probe. Blue star Lynch&#x27;s office. By this time, Lynch had finished listening to Li Jang Wos description, and his eyes were shining. It seems that there are far more single-sellled life forms on the moon than I thought.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo chimed in with a sigh. Yes, you definitely don&#x27;t need to worry about the experimental samples anymore. He paused, then continued. Xialin, what do you think could be the reason they&#x27;ve gathered together? It&#x27;s hard to say. Lynch and shook his head.</p>
<p>Well know the result after the items are sent back and analyzed. He was also very curious. What could possibly cause so many single-sellled life forms on the moon to come together? The key question is how did they move within the lunar ice layer? What signal brought them together? Lynchin was very curious about this. Lie Jian Guo nodded. That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Well know once we get the stuff back and analyze it. 6 hours later. Institute of biology. Professor Jang is staring at the long-term experimental data of the mice. The mice have survived for several hours in the simulated space environment.</p>
<p>No adverse reactions have been reported so far. That&#x27;s amazing. If humans could reach this level, we would never have to worry about cosmic radiation again. Professor Jeang looked at the experimental data and was filled with emotion. Next, we&#x27;ll wait for that special piece of ice from the moon to return so we can analyze it and see what&#x27;s so strange about it.</p>
<p>He had already received Lin Chen&#x27;s orders. Everything is ready. We&#x27;re just waiting for that special piece of ice to come back. Just then, a refrigerated truck was parked at the entrance of the research institute. An insulated storage box was carefully lifted off the ground.</p>
<p>It was sent directly to the core laboratory. The staff handed the insulated storage box to the laboratory engineer and then left. Professor Jeang, the items have been delivered. Upon hearing this, Professor Jeang came out of the data room. Looking at the insulated box, he then instructed, &quot;Put it into the sealed analysis room immediately.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll notify Chief Engineer Lynn to come over.&quot; Okay. As instructed, the engineer placed the insulated storage box into the sealed analysis chamber. Professor Jeang called Lynchin directly. A few minutes later, Lynchin appeared in the laboratory. As soon as he entered the lab, he asked, &quot;Professor Jeang, how&#x27;s it going? Have you started yet?&quot; Chief Engineer Lynn, &quot;It hasn&#x27;t started yet.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re waiting for you.&quot; &quot;Okay, let&#x27;s begin.&quot; Professor Jeang nodded and then instructed the engineer to begin. The engineer manipulated the robotic arm to slowly open the box door. The block of ice shimmering with a purple light appeared before everyone&#x27;s eyes. It&#x27;s purple. That&#x27;s amazing.</p>
<p>Could this be the color of single-sellled life on the moon? Just how many single-sellled organisms from the moon would it take to produce this color change? All the engineers were shocked by this scene. Professor Jeang was also surprised. He turned to Lyn Shun and asked, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, what do you think caused this?&quot; Chapter 193, Autonomous Devouring. Lyn Shun was also slightly shocked when he saw the block of ice. Upon hearing Professor Cenangs question, he frowned slightly.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t see the cause at the moment. Well have to wait until we get a microscope to determine the specifics. Although he knows a little more about genetic science than Professor Jeang and the others, but it is still just a mortal being as seen by the naked eye. Where can you see those single-sellled organisms with the naked eye? Professor Jeang also came to his senses and said awkwardly, &quot;Right, let&#x27;s use the microscope directly.&quot; Then he arranged for the engineers to start using the microscope. Engineers operate a robotic arm to transfer a block of purple ice under a microscope.</p>
<p>Everyone&#x27;s eyes were fixed on the large screen of the microscope. The next second, they witnessed a scene they would never forget. The single-sellled life inside the ice is swimming wildly. Those things are frantically gathering towards the center of the ice. It was as if something there was attracting them.</p>
<p>Piss. What is that? So many tiny life forms have gathered here. Wow. So, they live in groups, too. All the engineers were astonished.</p>
<p>Under the microscope, those lunar single-sellled life forms are densely packed together. People with trypophobia would probably faint if they saw this. The quantity is impossible to estimate at the moment. At this moment, Professor Jeang discovered an even more amazing scene. When those single-sellled organisms got close, they made a bizarre move.</p>
<p>A small single cell suddenly collided with a large one. Then the larger single cell swallowed the smaller one hole. Holy crap, they&#x27;re actually devouring each other on their own. Professor Jeang was so excited that he immediately started reciting traditional Chinese cultural classics. Even Lin Shan was stunned by this scene, exclaiming, &quot;This is amazing.&quot; I originally thought that these single-sellled life forms were simply able to adapt to harsh environments to survive.</p>
<p>I never expected such a magical scene. They can even devour themselves. Is this how they&#x27;ve managed to survive? The more Lynchin thought about it, the more excited he became. He immediately ordered, &quot;Enlarge the microscope.&quot; He wanted to see a clearer picture. Yes, Chief Engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>The engineer quickly adjusted the microscope magnification. Instantly, the image became clearer. The single-sellled life forms at the center of the ice block went mad. They collided and devoured each other. Each time it devours one of its own kind, its size increases by one size.</p>
<p>The color also became increasingly darker. It started as a transparent color, then turned into a light blue and gradually became a light purple. Are they devouring and evolving? It feels like we&#x27;re raising a venomous insect. This is amazing. Even single-sellled life forms exhibit this kind of devouring and evolutionary behavior.</p>
<p>Everyone was deeply shocked by this scene, and they all chimed in with their own comments. It can only be said that no matter how small the creature, there will always be a king of curls. Survival of the fittest exists in any environment. Professor Jeang was completely numb, muttering to himself, &quot;A miracle. This is simply a biological miracle.&quot; Lyn Shan was a little surprised.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s actually devouring and evolving. That&#x27;s amazing. Single-sellled organisms can devour each other. This is definitely unusual. Do they have self-awareness, or is this their evolutionary path? Lynchin became more and more excited as he thought about it.</p>
<p>If we can figure out the underlying principles, optimization of primary gene agents might lead to a breakthrough. A moment later, Professor Jeang also came to his senses. Chief Engineer Lynn, do you think they&#x27;ve already developed consciousness? Hard to say. Lynchin wasn&#x27;t sure either. Perhaps it&#x27;s just an instinct.</p>
<p>The idea that single-sellled life forms possess consciousness directly contradicts science. He prefers to believe it&#x27;s a biological instinct. Yes, it must be an instinct. Professor Jeang nodded in agreement. This is the only reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>10 minutes later. Originally, there were hundreds of single cells, but now only a dozen or so remain. Each one is three times the size of the previous one. The color turned dark purple. They continued to devour.</p>
<p>Finally, only the largest single cell remained. At this point, the single-sellled organism seemed to have eaten its fill and suddenly lay flat. It stopped moving directly inside the ice. This This is it. That&#x27;s amazing.</p>
<p>It swallowed so much that only one cell remained. The crucial point is after swallowing for so long, it&#x27;s still just a single-sellled life form in the end. It seems to have simply eaten its own kind to continue surviving. The engineers were whispering among themselves. Indeed, this situation was somewhat beyond their expectations.</p>
<p>They originally thought that these single-sellled organisms would evolve into more advanced organisms after consuming them. It turns out to be a single-sellled organism. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s gotten bigger. Professor Jeang was also a bit confused. Chief engineer Lynn, what&#x27;s going on? Has the evolution failed? Lynshin was also a little confused and shook his head.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s hard to say right now. I suggest we test his genes first to see if there are any changes. Good. Professor Jeang immediately arranged for engineers to begin testing the genes of that fat man&#x27;s cell. As Lynshin watched the staff begin melting the ice, he was thinking about how to optimize the primary gene serum.</p>
<p>He had a suspicion in his mind. The current difficulty in fusing primary gene agents lies precisely in insufficient gene activity. If we could simulate this process of absorption to ensure that gene fragments maintain high activity during fusion, this might solve the problem of single-sellled organism genes fusing into human genes. Thinking of this, he immediately said, &quot;Professor Jeang, please focus on gene activity and stability later.&quot; Professor Jeang nodded solemnly. &quot;Good.&quot; A moment later, the ice has completely melted.</p>
<p>The fat single-sellled organism inside was also carefully transferred to a petri dish. Then it was sent to the gene testing instrument. The engineer began operating the gene testing equipment. The data kept jumping on the screen. A few minutes later, the results came out.</p>
<p>Professor Jeang looked at the data and exclaimed in surprise, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn, this is amazing. The gene activity of the single cell after fagocytosis is 10 times that before. Stability has also improved five-fold.&quot; Lynn Chen&#x27;s eyes lit up. Sure enough, his guess was right. Old Jang, we have a new direction.</p>
<p>The optimization of the primary gene serum will start with devouring evolution. If successful, the speed of human genetic evolution could at least double. Lynch&#x27;s voice was full of excitement. Upon hearing this, Professor Jeang trembled with excitement. It really can double the improvement.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t that mean we&#x27;re one step closer to interstellar travel? Lynch nodded, his eyes shining. Not just one step. Once we overcome this hurdle, humanity&#x27;s adaptation to the space environment will be just around the corner. Construction of the moon palace base is currently in full swing. The Nanchan project is also progressing steadily.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the space-based carrier will also enter the research and development stage. Once gene therapy drugs are successfully developed, the great SEA kingdom will soon enter an era where everyone is like a dragon. Then we can officially begin the era of interstellar exploration. Chapter 194. The Indian Kingdom comes to our door.</p>
<p>Old Jeang. Lynchan suddenly spoke. Professor Jeang snapped out of his revery and quickly replied. Chief Engineer Lynn, please speak. Well proceed in two steps.</p>
<p>Lynshan raised his eyes, his gaze sharp. First, expand the scale of chimpanzeee testing. Find at least 20 healthy individuals and inject them with different concentrations of the fusion gene in three groups. Focus on monitoring organ tolerance and gene rejection response and record data every hour. Professor Jeang nodded and continued writing in his notebook.</p>
<p>Second, wait until the chimpanzeee test is completed and the safety period has passed. Immediately initiate the formulation development of the primary gene therapy drug. Let&#x27;s follow the idea of fagocitic evolution and first simulate the energy environment during cellular fagocytosis. We prioritize using extracts from lunar single cells as raw materials. And if that&#x27;s not enough, we&#x27;ll source them from the moon.</p>
<p>Professor Jang put down his pen, his eyes filled with excitement. Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll arrange for someone to work overtime right away. I guarantee it won&#x27;t be delayed. His hands were trembling as he held the notebook. Lyn Shan was still worried and continued to instruct.</p>
<p>Old Jeang, all experiments must be conducted with caution and speed. If something goes wrong, all our previous efforts will be wasted. Professor Jeang nodded vigorously. Understood. I will keep a close eye on every step and make sure no problem is overlooked.</p>
<p>The next two days, the Institute of Biology has completely entered a non-stop working mode. The laboratory lights are on 24 hours a day. The engineers took turns working shifts, their eyes bloodshot from exhaustion, but they refused to rest. Professor Jeang even lived and worked in the laboratory. And when he was tired, he would just lie down on the table and doze off for half an hour.</p>
<p>Every time the chimpanzeee monitoring data came out, he would rush to the screen immediately. 3 days later, Lynchin finally wrote out the complete plan for the primary gene. He took the plan to the biological laboratory. As soon as I pushed open the door, I heard Professor Jang exclaim, &quot;Hart rate is normal, liver and kidney function are normal. The gene sequence is stable, and no mutations have been found.&quot; Professor Jangs hair was messy, but his face was as excited as a child&#x27;s.</p>
<p>Lynchin walked over and asked, &quot;Old Jang, what&#x27;s making you so happy?&quot; Professor Jang turned around, saw Lin Shan, and immediately stepped forward excitedly to report, &quot;Lynn, there&#x27;s a new breakthrough in the chimpanzeee tests.&quot; After listening, Lynch nodded in satisfaction. &quot;Excellent. Next, we will officially begin the research and development of gene therapy drugs. This is my complete design. Please take a look.</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he handed the proposal to Professor Jeang. A complete gene therapy program, Professor Xen&#x27;s voice began to tremble. The engineers nearby also gathered around, and after seeing the contents, they all gasped in shock. The energy threshold for the devouring simulation. It&#x27;s accurate to three decimal places.</p>
<p>All the material proportions are listed. Even the amount of star stone used is indicated. If we follow this formula, we might be able to make a sample in a month. Professor Jang turned to the last page, suddenly looked up at Lynch Sean, his eyes reening. Chief Engineer Lynn, you wrote such a complete plan in just 3 days.</p>
<p>Almost there. Lynchan smiled. There are a few key points in the formula that I need to explain to you. Then he began to explain some of the technical difficulties in the formula. Professor Jang and the others became increasingly excited as they listened.</p>
<p>During this time they also kept raising various questions. Lynshan answered their questions in detail one by one. The atmosphere in the entire laboratory was like Lin Shun giving a technical lecture. Professor Jang and the others were all Lin Chen students. Each and every one of them was filled with a thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p>I hope to learn more about genes from this. Everyone was listening intently to Lynn Chen&#x27;s explanation. They didn&#x27;t even want to miss a single word Lynch said. At the same time, the far side of the moon, more than a dozen mining trucks shuttled across the ice. The beams of search light pierced the darkness, leaving streaks of light on the ice.</p>
<p>Chinfong sat on the mining truck, staring at the dense red dots on the screen. After a while, he shouted again, &quot;There&#x27;s another signal point over here.&quot; Kai, who was standing nearby, immediately controlled the robotic arm, and the special drill bit slowly went down. Ice shards flew everywhere, and soon a block of ice the size of a cement brick was pulled out. The red dots on the probe were flashing wildly. They were all single-sellled life forms on the moon.</p>
<p>Done. This is the 108th one today. Zhaokais voice was full of excitement. Lina&#x27;s voice came through the walkie-talkie. Brother Foam, the cargo hold of Kuan Ping 3 is full.</p>
<p>Should we send it back to Earth first? Chunf glanced at the time and nodded. Send them over. Tell them to come back quickly. There are still a lot of signal points to collect here. These past two days, all five additional data collection teams have arrived on the moon.</p>
<p>They search day and night, almost turning over the entire frozen layer on the far side of the moon. Living ice block is collected. It is immediately placed into a low temperature storage box. The Kuing spacecraft is transporting cargo to Earth one trip after another. I have no idea how many single-sellled life forms have been collected from the moon.</p>
<p>Similarly, the starstone collecting team was also busy. They carefully collected each starstone. Make sure that not a single star stone is lost. Blue star office of the dean of the academy of sciences. Lie Jian Guo had just hung up the phone call reporting to the moon when there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>Come in. Minister son from the ministry of commerce pushed open the door and entered his expression somewhat complicated. Deanly, I&#x27;m troubling you again. Lie Jian Guo asked curiously. Minister Son, what&#x27;s the matter now? People from India have arrived.</p>
<p>Minister Sun handed over a document. They said they want to buy rocket technology from us and they brought their sincerity with them. Lie Jian Guoo picked up the document, flipped through it, and sneered. The Indians want to sell us rocket technology. Didn&#x27;t they say they were going to land on Mars in 5 months? Why are they asking us? Minister son explained with a smile.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s exactly why. Their own technology makes it difficult to even fly off Earth. So they want to take a shortcut. They said they&#x27;d let us name our terms as long as we could by rocket technology. Lie Jian Guo placed the documents on the table.</p>
<p>Oh, we can name our own terms. When did they become so generous? Now almost everyone in the entire blue star world who wants to do business with us has this attitude. Minister son said with pride, especially after Sakurajimus sank, &quot;The attitudes of all nations on the entire planet Earth toward the great Sia kingdom have undergone a complete transformation regardless of their previous attitude. From then on, they all became extremely respectful and friendly. They dared to show disrespect to the increasingly powerful Great Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>The consequences would be far beyond what they could bear, especially those who come to do business with the Great Sa Kingdom. The great sia kingdom can set any terms they want. This period has been the most comfortable time for minister son. I never have to worry about business negotiations because it simply doesn&#x27;t exist. That&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>Lie Jango nodded. I can&#x27;t make this decision myself. Let me ask Shaolin first. He picked up the phone and dialed Lynch&#x27;s number. Kobayashi India wants to buy rocket technology.</p>
<p>What do you think? Lyn Shan had just come out of the laboratory at that moment. He paused for a moment after receiving the call then laughed. India buying rocket technology. Yes. So do you agree to sell? Lynchin thought for a moment and then said selling is fine but we can&#x27;t use food and we can&#x27;t use money.</p>
<p>Lie Jian Guo asked curiously. Then what will you use to exchange it? Organ Linshins voice carried a hint of amusement. Don&#x27;t they have iron ore and copper ore? Let them exchange them for high purity ore. Rocket technology is such an outdated technology that there&#x27;s no point in keeping it. If it could be exchanged for a large amount of or it would be a way to make use of waste.</p>
<p>Li Jang Wos eyes lit up. That&#x27;s great. We just need or for construction. Lynchin continued oldly. Please tell the Ministry of Commerce that all future transactions with foreign countries should be settled using the same amount of or.</p>
<p>Chapter 195. The strong only need to set the rules. All appearances are settled using or. Li Jian Guo was stunned for a moment. Then his eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
<p>The more I thought about it, the more brilliant the idea seemed. Cash is not really that important to the great Sia kingdom right now. But ores are different. Whether it&#x27;s the Kuaning space plane or the bite aerospace fighter, both require a large amount of mineral materials. Moreover, there is an even larger consumer of materials.</p>
<p>Nanchiman. Even just this initial project has already revitalized the entire metal industry of the great Sia Kingdom. All related materials industries are operating at full capacity and expanding production at an alarming rate. There&#x27;s also the possibility of building interstellar warships later on. That&#x27;s the real major consumer of materials.</p>
<p>Previously, we traded with other countries. It&#x27;s either food or transactions in the local currency. Food can fill your stomach. However, this currency is completely ineffective in cuttingedge technology fields. Now, Lynn Shun has this suggestion.</p>
<p>They directly shifted the focus of the transaction to the most tangible resources. Great. That&#x27;s wonderful. Li Jang Wos voice trembled. Shaolin, trading or for technology is a surefire way to make a profit.</p>
<p>Lynchin smiled and said, &quot;That&#x27;s right. What we lack right now is all kinds of materials. Foreign countries want to do business with us. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they have money or not as long as they have resources. Even crude oil, we should stockpile more.</p>
<p>You never know when it might come in handy. If there&#x27;s nowhere to store it, just fill up the dachching oil field with what we already have. Lie Jian Guo became more and more excited as he listened. Haha, Shaolin, you&#x27;re really something. You even thought of that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go tell the Ministry of Commerce right away. Don&#x27;t worry, they&#x27;ll definitely agree. I hung up the phone. Lie Jang Guoo walked back to his office, unable to suppress the smile on his face. Minister Sun was still waiting.</p>
<p>When he saw Li Jian Guo come in, his smile, which he couldn&#x27;t suppress even with an AK, was wide open. He quickly went up to him and asked, &quot;Oldly, how did it go?&quot; Lie Jian Guo laughed heartily and said, &quot;Chief engineer Lynn has agreed.&quot; Really? That&#x27;s good. Minister Sun breathed a sigh of relief. In fact, according to their Ministry of Commerce, they agreed to sell rocket technology. However, these technology sales are now mainly decided by the Syaku Academy.</p>
<p>Currently, the Academy of Sciences in Shaman wields more influence than any other department. Everything changed after Lin Shan came to the Xiaku Academy. Dean Lee, does Chief Engineer Lynn have any other requests? Minister Sun always felt that things weren&#x27;t that simple. Lie Jian Guo chuckled and explained. Minister Sun, you were absolutely right.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Lynn has spoken. If India wants rocket technology, we can give it to them, but it cannot be traded with food or money. Minister son narrowed his eyes. Then what will we use to exchange it? Or stone liango said emphasizing each word. High purity iron ore and copper ore.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t they have a lot of minerals? Let them trade these for them. Or minister son was taken aback for a moment then realized great trading ore is a good method. He was still worried before the great Sia kingdom has no shortage of the grain provided by the Indian kingdom. local currency transactions but nowhere to spend it. Switching to or now would solve their problem perfectly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chief Engineer Lynn also said Lie Jian Guo added that all subsequent foreign trade transactions will be settled using the same amount of ore. Minister Suns breathing quickened all the transactions they&#x27;re trying to gather all the world&#x27;s minerals into our hands. Lie Jang Wo laughed. Otherwise, what did you think? Now that we are powerful, we should set the rules. Minister&#x27;s son nodded vigorously, his eyes full of excitement.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. Now that we&#x27;re powerful, we should be the ones to set the rules. Back then, when the great Sia Kingdom wanted to join the World Trade Organization, it went through countless hardships before finally succeeding. Even so, at that time, Western countries such as the United States added layers of pressure. However, even under these circumstances, the Great Sea Kingdom, relying on its thousands of years of wisdom, managed to emerge from the chaos and gradually develop.</p>
<p>In just 20 years, it has developed into the powerful nation it is today. No one dares to provoke them. Nowadays, they can arbitrarily set international rules and no country dares to stand up and oppose them. Minister Sun returned to the Ministry of Commerce. He immediately called his secretary in immediately notify the delegation from India.</p>
<p>Just say I summoned them. Tell them to come here now. Immediately the secretary didn&#x27;t dare delay and immediately turned to make a phone call. Less than half an hour. The delegation from India arrived in a hurry.</p>
<p>The leader was the foreign minister of India. As soon as he entered the meeting room, he had a big smile on his face. Minister son, is there good news? Your country has agreed to sell rocket technology. Minister son sat in the main seat looking calm and composed. Agreement is agreement but we have one condition.</p>
<p>The Indian foreign minister felt a pang of anxiety and the smile on his face froze for a moment. Condition you said it and we will never refuse to do anything we can. Minister son looked up and his gaze fell on him. We don&#x27;t want food and we don&#x27;t want foreign exchange. We want rocket technology.</p>
<p>You must exchange it for high purity or iron ore or or copper or either is fine. Trading with or the Indian foreign minister was stunned. His mouth opened and closed but he couldn&#x27;t say a word for a long time. The members of the delegation behind him were all dumbfounded. They looked at each other their eyes filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>Or the great kingdom only wants minerals. You should know that India has no shortage of minerals. The iron or veins within the territory are so plentiful that you can easily find high purity iron or by simply digging around. They were still wondering what harsh conditions the Great Sea Kingdom would impose. Are they asking them to seed territory or should we ask them to open their markets? They were even prepared to be ripped off.</p>
<p>But now the great Sia Kingdom only wants minerals. This is like a windfall. The Indian foreign minister realized what was happening and slapped his thigh. Agreed. We agree.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just or we have plenty. Just tell us how many you need. We&#x27;ll arrange transportation right away. The smile on his face was 10 times brighter than before. My heart was bursting with joy and I felt like I had gotten a tremendous advantage.</p>
<p>The other delegations from India and Afghanistan had similar expressions. They all looked like they had gotten a huge advantage as if they were afraid that minister son would go back on his word. Minister son looked at him and sneered inwardly but remained outwardly calm. Specific share. My men will handle things with you.</p>
<p>Remember, if the or is not pure enough, the transaction is void. The Indian foreign minister nodded quickly. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s definitely high purity. I&#x27;ll go back and prepare right away. I&#x27;ll leave a colleague to discuss the specific share with you.</p>
<p>Okay. Minister son nodded as if to see the guest out. The Indian foreign minister bid farewell and immediately got up to leave. The speed at which he walked was as if he were rushing to be reincarnated. It was as if Minister&#x27;s son was afraid that if he was even a step too late, he would regret it.</p>
<p>As he walked out of the Ministry of Commerce building, the Indian foreign minister finally couldn&#x27;t help but burst into laughter. I never expected this. The great Sia Kingdom is so easy to talk to. Trading or for rocket technology. We&#x27;ve made a killing this time.</p>
<p>Haha. Those passing by stared at the Indian foreign minister and his entourage as if they were idiots. The Indian foreign minister didn&#x27;t care at all about the strange looks he received. He immediately made a phone call to boast to Demo the Immortal. Chapter 196 Progress on the Southern Heavenly Gate, India, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.</p>
<p>After hearing the report, Demo the Immortal&#x27;s eyes were filled with ecstatic joy. Huh. The Great Sa Kingdom is really stupid, only needing or trading technology. Indeed, when Demo Laosen heard this news, he also felt that they had gotten a huge advantage. At first, he thought the foreign minister was lying to him.</p>
<p>After confirming it repeatedly, he became excited. He might even feel a panging of regret if it came to grain trading. But he really didn&#x27;t feel any heartache about the ore. On the contrary, they felt that they had gotten a huge advantage. After all, India may lack other things, but it is rich in mineral resources.</p>
<p>After the initial excitement subsided, Demo immediately instructed his secretary beside him. Immediately notify the Ministry of Mining and have them prepare the corresponding or for the transaction with the Great Sa Kingdom. Once the contract is signed, deliver it immediately. Don&#x27;t give the great SA kingdom any time to return. Yes, Prime Minister, the secretary replied, and went to make the arrangements.</p>
<p>Demo stood by the office window, looking at the beautiful scenery outside, his eyes filled with excitement. With the rocket technology of the Great Sa Kingdom, the Mars landing 5 months from now will definitely be a success. Demo the immortal is now full of confidence. But he didn&#x27;t even consider the level of industrial development in their own country. Many components that the great Sia kingdom can process, the Indian kingdom may not be able to process.</p>
<p>The end result is that they have the technology but can&#x27;t use it. Alternatively, you may need to purchase the corresponding parts from the great sea kingdom at a high price. That afternoon, the official website of the Ministry of Commerce of the Great Sea Kingdom published an announcement. From this day forward, all foreign trade and commodity transactions of the great Sia Kingdom shall be settled in the form of high purity or of equal value. The announcement was released.</p>
<p>The whole world is in an uproar. The smaller countries were the first to react, especially in Africa and South America. Those only have mineral resources. However, it is a country with little cuttingedge technology. The moment they saw the announcement, everyone was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Or you can exchange or for the technology of the great Sia kingdom. My god, is this real? We have iron ore. We have copper ore. Get ready immediately. Contact the Ministry of Commerce of the Great Sia Kingdom.</p>
<p>These small countries. I was looking at other countries before. They were incredibly envious of the various products traded with the Great Sia Kingdom. But they had no money or food and were not qualified to negotiate with the Great Sea Kingdom. Now it&#x27;s all right.</p>
<p>As long as you bring out the ore, you can exchange it for the technology you&#x27;ve always dreamed of. This was like opening a door for them. In contrast, countries without mineral resources are in dire straits. We&#x27;re doomed. We&#x27;re out of ore.</p>
<p>How can we trade with the Great Sea Kingdom? Are we going to buy ore and then resell it to the Great Sa Kingdom? And the Eagle&#x27;s reaction. That was utter anger. Inside the White House office, Optton slammed the documents on the table onto the floor. Damn it. The great Sea Kingdom is engaging in monopolistic practices.</p>
<p>They want to control all the world&#x27;s mineral resources. He wouldn&#x27;t be as naive as those small countries, thinking this is some kind of welfare. The moment he saw the announcement, he knew what the great Sia Kingdom was thinking. Stand up an object. I wouldn&#x27;t dare.</p>
<p>He could only rage in vain. Durret stood to the side, his face pale. He was holding a report in his hand. The label shows the current mineral reserves of the United States. Because of the previous technological blockade imposed by the great sea kingdom, the United States or import channels have long been cut off.</p>
<p>Their domestic mineral veins, either the grade is low or the mining cost is high. Now the great sea kingdom has pulled this stunt. This effectively cuts off the US&#x27;s access to minerals from other countries. Mr. President, Trudeau&#x27;s voice trembled.</p>
<p>Our mineral reserves are only enough to sustain high-end manufacturing for 6 months. Optin turned his head sharply, his eyes bloodshot. 6 months. Say it again. Durret dare not look up.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Only 3 months. If we cannot find a source of or as soon as possible our space program and chip program, everything has to be shut down. He dared not hide it any longer.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Optton slumped into his chair, clutching his hair with both hands. He never imagined that the great Sia Kingdom would use this method to control the entire world. No, we can&#x27;t just let it go like this. Optin suddenly stood up. Contact those countries that have mineral resources.</p>
<p>Tell them we are willing to exchange technology for ore. The conditions are better than in the great sea kingdom. Durret was stunned. But president, our technology, the technology that the US uses now is outdated. They have all been surpassed by the great sea kingdom.</p>
<p>Why would those countries choose to exchange China s advanced technology for America&#x27;s outdated technology instead of China&#x27;s? Optton knew this, but he had no other choice at the moment. Never mind, let&#x27;s give it a try. At the same time, all the sealed mines in the country should be restarted and mining operations resumed immediately. Durret could only nod, but his heart was ice cold. He knew it was all in vain, but they have to do it.</p>
<p>Almost the entire world of earth is discussing countermeasures because of the great sea kingdom&#x27;s change in trading rules. Even multinational corporations that trade with the great sa kingdom are worried about how to acquire more minerals to trade with the great sia kingdom. It can be said that Lynn Chin&#x27;s decision directly disrupted the entire international trading market on Earth. At the same time, the Nanchan project is also progressing rapidly. The foundation for the first phase of the project has been laid.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just waiting for the defense system and ecosystem to be installed. Inside the defense systems laboratory, Fatty Wong was standing in front of the big screen holding a laser pointer. He spoke eloquently while looking at the energy circuit diagram above. Look here. In the previous design, 15% of the energy was lost during transmission.</p>
<p>By changing the circuit to a spiral shape and adding a superconducting coating, the loss can be reduced to below 3%. The surrounding engineers all nodded in approval. Team leader Lu Jin Long stood at the back of the crowd, his face full of satisfaction. Since Lie Jian Guo made the first visit, he then focused his attention on Fatty Wong. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that this kid was a true genius.</p>
<p>It can not only optimize the energy circuit, it can also propose new ideas for the algorithms of defense systems. Wong Leu Gene Long walked over and patted him on the shoulder. your optimization plan. The higher-ups attach great importance to this. We&#x27;ve decided to put you in charge, responsible for upgrading and transforming the entire defense system.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong was stunned, his eyes widening like copper bells. Take the lead. I He was just an ordinary engineer before. At most, he would offer suggestions. Now that he&#x27;s in charge of a big project, this happiness has come too suddenly.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#x27;s you. Lu Jin Long said with a smile. Do a good job. The defense of the Nanchiman project depends on you. Fatty Wong nodded vigorously, his heart surging with excitement.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, team leader Lu. I guarantee I&#x27;ll complete the mission. At the same time, he was secretly thinking, &quot;Old Lynn, I&#x27;m almost catching up with you.&quot; He chapter 197, the first phase of the South Heavenly Gate, is completed. After the optimization plan for the defense project of the space city Ling Sha Palace was approved, the progress of the entire space city began to accelerate. 10 days later, the first phase of the Nanchiman space project has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>A massive futuristic southern gate behind which lies the silhouette of a silver white futuristic Ling Sha Palace. General Jeang dressed in a crisp military uniform arrived directly at Ling Sha Palace aboard the Kuaning spacecraft. Meanwhile, there was also the engineering acceptance team from the Xiaku Academy. Each member holding a testing tablet. Wong Lelay prepared to demonstrate the defense system.</p>
<p>General Ciangs voice was firm and resounding. His eyes were filled with excitement. He specifically applied to preside over this acceptance inspection. Originally, it would have been enough for the Seyaku Academy to pass the acceptance inspection. General Jeang wanted to see what the space city would look like in its early stages as soon as possible, which is why he proposed to preside over this acceptance test.</p>
<p>Defense system control room. After receiving the order, Fatty Wongs eyes were filled with excitement. Roger that, General. Activate the energy shield now. His fingers flew across the keyboard as he typed the commands.</p>
<p>Moment. A pale blue light film illuminated the surface of Ling Sha Palace as if it were covered with a layer of flowing crystal. How much energy was lost? General Jeang pressed, reporting to the general. Only 0.01%. Even lower than the design target.</p>
<p>Fattywan&#x27;s voice was full of excitement. Not long ago, he was just an ordinary engineer. Now, however, he can demonstrate the system he spearheaded in front of the general. It felt like a dream. When he learned that it was all because of the suggestion Lyn Shan had given him that time, that&#x27;s what led to his current success.</p>
<p>His gratitude towards Lyn Shan was like a surging river, endless and boundless. Lynchan did not participate in today&#x27;s inspection because he did not have time. Definitely cow out to Lyn Shun. After the defense module passed acceptance testing, next we will proceed with the acceptance of the ecological cycle module. Professionals organized by the Seyaku Academy conducted a comprehensive inspection and verification.</p>
<p>Oxygen circulation rate 100%. Wastewater is 100% recycled. The simulated gravity system is qualified. The energy cycle system is qualified. For each project he inspected, General Jeang received a report that it had passed perfectly.</p>
<p>His eyes were full of satisfaction. I recall that in the early days of space missions, astronauts could only live and conduct experiments in the cramped space of the space capsule. Now, the Great Sa Kingdom finally has its own space home. Acceptance completed. General Zang stood in the command center of Ling Shiao Palace and suddenly raised his hand in salute.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Nanchiman project has passed inspection. All those involved in the acceptance process erupted in cheers and Fatty Wong wiped away tears of excitement. He took out his phone and secretly sent Lynchin a message. Old Lynn, we&#x27;re a couple. Blue Star Biological Gene Laboratory.</p>
<p>Lynchin received the text message from Fatty and smiled slightly. Great. The first phase of the space city project is finally completed and we can continue to expand it. Now his focus is almost entirely on the biological gene laboratory. He wanted to develop the primary gene therapy drug as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As for other projects, he will also take the time to keep an eye on them. After the first phase of the Nanchiman project passed acceptance, the first batch of 1,000 troops from the Dashia Aerospace Force were quickly stationed there. Each person wore a dark blue aerospace military uniform with the five gold characters, Great Sia Aerospace Army, embroidered on their shoulder straps. Their steps were synchronized and the sound of their footsteps echoed in the corridor as if striking the hearts of everyone present. The flag pole stands in the center of Nansmen and the five-star red flag is neatly folded.</p>
<p>Flag raiser Lee Ming took a deep breath and received the national flag with both hands. Salute. At the command, everyone raised their hands. The national flag was slowly unfurled the moment the national anthem began to play. I swear.</p>
<p>All the officers and soldiers shouted in unison, their voices so loud that the air seemed to tremble. We swear to protect the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s outer space to the death without retreating a single step. If anyone dares to invade, no matter how far away they are, they will be punished. The vows echoed in Lingsha Palace. At the ground command center, everyone clenched their fists as they watched this scene.</p>
<p>General Jeang watched this scene, then quietly turned his face away and wiped the corner of his eye. This is the spirit of the soldiers of the great Sia Kingdom, always ready to step forward when needed most. At this time, office of the Academy of Sciences and SIA Lynshin stared at the screen, watching the soldiers of the Great Summer Army take their oath, his eyes filled with pride and satisfaction. He knew that this was not just the completion of a space city, but also a symbol of the technological strength and national spirit of the great Sa Kingdom. Shaolin, we did it.</p>
<p>Li Jang Wos voice choked with emotion and his eyes involuntarily welled up with tears. Yes, the initial phase of the space city is complete, and the second phase, the space factory, will begin construction soon. Lynch&#x27;s eyes were full of anticipation. The successful construction of the space city signifies that the great SA kingdom has officially entered the era of space domination. The next step is to develop the space carrier which will allow us to embark on interstellar voyages.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Lynchin looked at Lie Jian Guo with a serious expression. Oldly next we may start the space carrier project. You need to make preparations on your side. A space-based aircraft carrier. Lie Jian Guo was taken aback at first.</p>
<p>Then his eyes lit up. Shaolin, you have another technical plan. Lynch nodded. That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s expected to start in about a week.</p>
<p>Now, the inheritance of the primary gene-based medicine is about to be completed. Next, he will directly choose the technology inheritance of space carriers. Let me give Li Jang Guo a heads up so he can prepare in advance. Great. Lie Jian Guo clapped his hands excitedly.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll get back and start making preparations right away. At the same time, the great Sia Kingdom&#x27;s television station began broadcasting live the grand occasion of the arrival of the new resident at the South Heavenly Gate. The oaths of the aerospace forces echoed throughout the streets and alleys. Everywhere you look, people are cheering and celebrating. The internet was in an uproar.</p>
<p>Huh. Phase one of Space City is finally completed. It&#x27;s wonderful that the Ling Sha Palace is guarded by heavenly soldiers. I wonder when the space city will open. I want to go there for a visit.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t wait for that day to come. The entire Great Sa Kingdom was thoroughly excited after seeing the true appearance of the space city because what they saw was almost the same architecture as the mythical southern heavenly gate. This shows that the people of the Great Sea Kingdom had an incredibly deep affection and longing for the mythical southern heavenly gate. During the Great Sa Kingdom&#x27;s complete revalry, foreign nisens were completely dumbfounded. My god, is this a real space base or is it special effects? The Great Sa Kingdom is moving too fast.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re still researching Mars probes and they already have space fortresses. Please take me with you, Great Sea. I want to see space, too. Meanwhile, in the White House, the American opt stared at the live stream screen, expressionless. Nobody knows what he&#x27;s thinking.</p>
<p>Trudeau stood to the side, his face grim. President, the great Sa Kingdom has already built its space fortress. What do we do now? Optin paused for a moment, then spoke in a deep voice. Regardless of the situation in Great Sa Kingdom, all I need is for you to guarantee the smooth progress of the Mars project. Trudeau nodded quickly.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, Mr. President. We&#x27;ve been working around the clock. We guarantee the mission will be completed. After Durit left, Optton fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>The technological development of the Great Sa Kingdom has far exceeded his imagination. If they can&#x27;t keep up with the pace of the Great Sea Kingdom, the United States may be in complete decline. But right now, they can&#x27;t even gather enough ore. So, how can they keep up? Since the last time the Great Sea Kingdom officially announced that it only needed to trade or, all countries on the entire planet stopped exporting minerals and wanted to keep them to trade with the Great Sa Kingdom. Even their allies, the US, have stopped exporting minerals to them.</p>
<p>Currently, all they can do in their country is restart those closed mines. However, due to a long period of non-mining, it will take some time to restore production capacity. This period will be very difficult for the US. At that moment, he finally truly understood what it meant to be punished. Now, he hopes that the Mars project will proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Chapter 198, the legacy of the space carrier India. Demo the immortal saw that the great Sa Kingdom had begun to station troops in the space city. His eyes were full of envy. At the same time, he felt a little relieved. Fortunately, his decisive decision to return all the disputed territories to the Great Sea Kingdom was commendable.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the thought of the consequences terrified him. Rocket technology from the Great Sea Kingdom came to mind. Demo the immortal felt happy again. Although we&#x27;re responsible for 10 million tons of ore, it&#x27;s worth it. As long as we land on Mars before the Great Sea Kingdom, this is a guaranteed profit.</p>
<p>With this in mind, he immediately notified the Mars project team to speed up the research and development process. However, he had no idea that what followed was just the beginning of a nightmare for their Indian space agency. The Great Sa Kingdom 8:00 in the evening, Lynn Shan, as always returned to his apartment from the biological gene laboratory. After a quick wash, I lay down on the bed and my consciousness entered the inheritance space. The familiar silver white laboratory instantly unfolded.</p>
<p>The optimization of the primary gene-based agents has reached its final stage. Almost done. It should be finished tonight. Line looked at the experiment which had reached its final stage. His eyes filled with excitement.</p>
<p>Then he continued to work in the Heritage Space Laboratory. 2 hours later, a familiar notification sound rang out in the inheritance space. Congratulations to the inheritor for completing the basic gene potion technology inheritance, unlocking a new inheritance technology. Please select. I choose the complete technology for space-based aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Lynshin made his choice without the slightest hesitation. Immediately afterwards, Lynshin felt a vast amount of technical knowledge being poured into his mind. From the special alloy formula of the mother ship&#x27;s keel, energy calibration parameters for the anti-gravity array, from the fire control system logic of shiporn weapons, every detail is crystal clear. Lynch closed his eyes to process the information for a moment. And when he opened them again, his eyes were full of excitement.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s more complete than expected and even includes a modification plan adapted to Earth&#x27;s resources. He walked to the virtual experimental platform and gestured with his finger in the air. A kilometer long mother ship slowly unfolds. First, optimize the propulsion system. On the virtual screen, the engine structure diagram changes rapidly.</p>
<p>The original ring-shaped thruster was changed to a spiral shape. Lynshin became more and more excited as he made changes and he was completely immersed in the process. After modifying the power system, I opened the weapon system interface. The electromagnetic rail guns cooling time is too long. We need to add a superconducting heat dissipation layer.</p>
<p>Time quietly slips away in this space of heritage. The next day, Lin Shan emerged from the inheritance space. His eyes filled with excitement, showing no sign of fatigue. This is the benefit of having a space for inheritance. As his consciousness entered the inheritance space, his body entered a state of deep sleep.</p>
<p>This state is better than anyone else&#x27;s sleep in the world. Lynshin quickly washed up, had breakfast in the cafeteria, and then took a walk around the gene lab. Instruct Professor Jeang to take full responsibility for the next few days. If you need anything, just contact him. Then Lynshan returned to his office and began writing the technical proposal for the space carrier.</p>
<p>5 days later, office of the dean of the Academy of Sciences. Lyn Shan holding a laptop knocked on the door and came in. Lie Jian Guo immediately became excited upon seeing it. Shaolin, the design draft is finished. Lynch nodded.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. They&#x27;re all here. Lie Jian Guoo took Lin Chin&#x27;s computer and upon looking at it, his expression instantly turned to one of shock. On the screen, the side view of the space carrier was magnificent and the great Sia dragon flag pattern on the bow was lielike. The parameters marked below made him breathe heavily.</p>
<p>1280 m long, equipped with three anti-gravity cores. Lynshan nodded, pulled up a chair, and sat down, pointing his finger at a certain spot on the drawing. In addition, I would like to propose a concept, a near-earth space defense network. Lie Jian Guo looked up, his eyes filled with doubt. Defense network? Yes.</p>
<p>Lynchin picked up his pen and drew a circle on the edge of the drawing. Deploy 36 unmanned surveillance stations centered on Ling Sha Palace and use the space carrier as a mobile force. In this way, whether it is a meteorite or a spacecraft from another country, as long as it enters low Earth orbit, we can detect it immediately. Moreover, it can achieve 24/7, providing a comprehensive and seamless attack on the Earth&#x27;s surface. He paused, his tone becoming serious.</p>
<p>Also, the second phase of the Nanchiman project needs to be modified. It must be incorporated into the mother ship birth. The maintenance and resupply of the mother ship cannot be too far from Linga Palace. Lie Jang Wo looked at the schematic diagram of the defense network on the blueprint without the slightest hesitation. Okay, we&#x27;ll do it your way.</p>
<p>The second phase of the Nanchiman plan will be adjusted immediately and I will arrange the preparation of the defense network right away. Next, the two discussed the specific project proposal. Then, Lee Gian Guo began to convene a meeting with relevant personnel. An hour later, conference room of the Xiaku Academy. More than 50 topmissions and experts sat in the conference room.</p>
<p>As is customary, a top secret confidentiality agreement is signed first. I wonder what project chief engineer Lynn has brought us this time. The second phase of the space city project has already begun. Could it be some other space related project? Could it be a spaceship? Isn&#x27;t this a bit beyond the scope of the curriculum? With chief engineer Lynn here, it&#x27;s not beyond our scope at all. Allmademians and experts are extremely familiar with this process.</p>
<p>They were no longer as surprised or shocked as before. Instead, everyone speculated about what new project it might be. Then it&#x27;s the same familiar scene. Lyn Shun and Lie Jian Guo walked into the office. Lie Jian Guo stood in the main seat, his gaze sweeping over the crowd.</p>
<p>Everyone, I won&#x27;t waste any more words. I&#x27;ve called everyone here today to form the Space Air Carrier Project team. As soon as he finished speaking, a low gasp of surprise rose from below. What? It&#x27;s a space carrier? Could it be one of those aircraft carriers that can fly into outer space? TSK. TSK.</p>
<p>No wonder chief designer Lynn never mentioned the naval carrier battle group plan. It turns out he was preparing to achieve it all in one go. Yes, I even proposed building nuclearpowered aircraft carriers back then, but it was rejected. Now I finally understand. Many missians involved in aircraft carriers have finally come to their senses.</p>
<p>After seeing the successful development of controlled nuclear fusion, they mentioned the issue of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers for the Navy. However, Lin Shuin rejected the plan. Lynch&#x27;s reason at the time was that the time was not yet right, and yet only a short time has passed. They&#x27;ve actually built a space-based carrier. Ignoring the shock of the academy missions below, Li Jian Guo continued, &quot;The project is divided into three groups.</p>
<p>Overall design group, power system group, weapon system group. The overall design team is led by academician Xiao Ming. The power system team is assigned to academician Jean Chidong and the weapons team is led by Lu Gene Long. Comrade Xin remains the chief designer responsible for overall technical guidance. None of the experts orademicians had any objections.</p>
<p>Next, we moved on to the technical explanation session. Lynshan patiently explained each technical challenge to the experts and missians. A few hours later, that concludes the explanation. Li Jang Wo spoke again and announced. Now I officially announce the Lawnbird space carrier project is officially established.</p>
<p>Next, everyone must go all out to ensure that the Lawnbird space mothership lands as soon as possible. Chapter 199 expansion of the moon palace begins. The Lanbird space carrier project was established. The entire resources of the great Sea Kingdom were once again concentrated on this project. Of course, the gene therapy project will not be affected.</p>
<p>It remains the highest level project. After returning to the weapons research institute, the weapons team leader, Lu Gene Long, immediately began to allocate personnel. He immediately called Fatty Wong to his office. Team leader, did you call me here because of a new project? Fatty Wong entered the office, his eyes filled with anticipation. The Lawnbird space carrier project was just established today, and they&#x27;re planning to transfer you to the new project.</p>
<p>Would you like to participate? A space carrier? Upon hearing this, Fatty Wongs eyes lit up with excitement. Team leader, I&#x27;ll participate. I want to participate. Okay. You&#x27;ll be participating in the project as a core member this time.</p>
<p>I hope you can continue to carry forward your previous talents. Lu Jin Long said calmly. He had already witnessed Wong Lays talent. In the past, if you wanted to participate in such an important project, you would definitely have to consider seniority. But things are different now.</p>
<p>Whoever has the talent gets promoted. Fatty Wong patted his chest and assured him. Team leader, don&#x27;t worry. I promise I won&#x27;t let the motherland down. After a pause, he couldn&#x27;t help but ask.</p>
<p>I wonder who the chief designer is. Lu Jin Long answered earnestly. It must be our chief designer, Lynn. His eyes were filled with admiration. It really is chief engineer Lynn.</p>
<p>A glint of light appeared in Fatty Wongs eyes. Lu Jin Long nodded in satisfaction, then gave Wong Pongzi a few more instructions before telling him to go back and prepare. Wong Pongi suppressed his excitement as he walked out of Lu Gin Longs office, only becoming truly excited after closing the door. Very good. I, Fatty Wong, am here for the Space Carrier weapon project.</p>
<p>I must work hard this time and try my best to impress Lynn. He was thinking wildly to himself that as long as he worked hard enough, he believed that one day he would be able to catch up with Lynn Shun. The Luan Bird space carrier project is progressing rapidly. That day, Lyn Shun inspected the weapons project. I just happened to see Fatty Wong.</p>
<p>Fatty. When Fatty Wong heard that familiar voice, he turned around in disbelief. Upon closer inspection, Lynn Shan was standing in the laboratory, a smile on his lips. Old Lynn, Chief Engineer Lynn. He was so excited he was almost incoherent, his eyes filled with surprise.</p>
<p>I finally ran into Lynch in the lab. He knew that Lyn Shan was very busy, so he almost never bothered Lynch. Lynch walked over and asked, &quot;Fatty, do you have any ideas about the weapon systems for the Lawnbird space carrier project this time?&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; Fatty Wong scratched the back of his head a little embarrassedly. &quot;No, I haven&#x27;t even fully figured out this weapon system yet. The weapon systems of the space carrier project are quite different from those of the Nanchamin space city.</p>
<p>Several days passed and he was still familiarizing himself with the technical documents. The more familiar he became with Lynchan, the more impressive he felt Lynch was. Actually, he only suggested an idea for the optimization plan for the space city last time. Lynchan explained the specific plan to him. This time, he was determined to rely on his own abilities.</p>
<p>They have made significant achievements in the weapon systems of the space air carrier project. Lynch nodded. Do a good job. The weapon system is the mother ship&#x27;s fangs. There can be no mistakes.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong replied seriously, old Lynn. Chief engineer Lynn, don&#x27;t worry. I will definitely do my best. Lynn Shan patted him on the shoulder, said nothing more. And turned to find Lu Jin Long.</p>
<p>Fatty Wong watched his retreating figure and clenched his fist tightly. I had only one thought in my mind. I absolutely cannot let La Lin down this time. At the same time, the Moon Palace Base, the second phase of the project, is also in full swing. With thousands of construction vehicles operating simultaneously, the super 3D building printer is rapidly expanding according to the design drawings.</p>
<p>According to the second phase of the project plan, once completed, it will become a city that can accommodate a million people divided into research and development area, living area, industrial area, animal husbandry area, and planting area. It is almost possible to achieve ecological cycle and food self-sufficiency. Currently, the research team is also working hard to develop conventional food crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans, and corn that can be grown on a large scale on the moon. Ordinary poultry, pigs, cattle, and sheep are also being renovated. Everything is for the future so that the moon palace city can become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>No matter where you are, you must have the freedom to farm. On the other side, the far side of the moon, Shinfangs special mining team has already completed the mining of the entire starstone mining area. Attention all teams, conduct one last comprehensive search and do not miss any star stones. Chinfong gave the order again. During this period, they were almost always stationed on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p>If supplies are needed, just send someone back to the moon palace to collect them. Now, all the star stones have finally been collected. More than 1 million tons of starstone were collected in total. These star stones will become an important cornerstone for the interstellar development of the Great Sea Kingdom. Now that the star stones have been mined, Shenfong and his team will continue their search for single-sellled life on the moon.</p>
<p>office of the dean of the Academy of Sciences. Lie Jian Guo stood in front of his desk looking at the screen in his office. The screen is connected to a video conference at the central hub. The old man sat on the other side of the camera. His hair was gray but his eyes were bright.</p>
<p>The space carrier project is already underway and the first space carrier is expected to roll off the production line in about a month. Lie Jian Guo reported earnestly. The old man nodded. What about the Nanchiman base? The deployment of the 36 unmanned sentry posts of the defense network has begun. Lie Jian Guoo pulled up the design drawings and said, &quot;The second phase of Nanchiman has adjusted the plan, added a mother ship birth, and the supply line can cover the entire near-earth orbit.&quot; The old man&#x27;s gaze fell on the picture, and he slowly began to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;How&#x27;s the gene serum project going?&quot; Lie Jang Wos tone became even more excited when this was mentioned. The chimpanzeee testing period has expired. There was zero genetic rejection and the organ tolerance was even higher than expected. The next step is to prepare for human trials. Upon hearing this, the old man nodded in satisfaction and continued to inquire.</p>
<p>What about the expansion of the moon palace? How long will it take to complete? Lie Jian Guo responded respectfully. It is expected to be completed in 3 months, at which time lunar colonization can be carried out. At the same time, the lunar smelter has been built and put into operation, and large-scale mining of lunar minerals has begun, which can meet all the material needs of the Nanchiman space city. Very good, the old man couldn&#x27;t help but praise, his voice tinged with excitement. Then, the old man added, &quot;You must remember that while ensuring the project&#x27;s progress, you must strictly adhere to safety regulations and cannot be complacent in any way.&quot; Upon hearing this, Lie Jiano felt a warmth in his heart.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t worry, we will keep a close eye on every step. Then the elderly man gave a few more instructions and then ended the video conference. After the old man turned off the video conference, a glint of shrewdness flashed in his eyes. It&#x27;s time to let the whole nation know about comrade Xin, this great hero. Chapter 200, giving Lynn Chin a recognition.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time. The elderly man, Tian Shu, picked up the phone. Notify the others that we will have a meeting in the conference room in 10 minutes. 10 minutes later, the conference room was brightly lit. Several senior executives arrived one after another.</p>
<p>Seeing that Ton Shu was waiting in advance, they all put away their usual relaxed demeanor. Ton Shu, why did you summon us so urgently? Is something important? The leader of the Ton Shu nodded, his voice authoritative. I&#x27;ve called you here for only one thing. It&#x27;s time to give comrade Lynn Chin a proper title. Everyone in the conference room paused for a moment, then nodded in support.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s definitely time to vindicate comrade Lin Shan support. It&#x27;s time to let the people know who our great hero is. Haha. The tion shu ship gestured for them to speak. His voice steady yet powerful.</p>
<p>Now the technology of the great Sia Kingdom has reached the pinnacle of the blue star. Comrade Lin Chin&#x27;s contributions must be remembered. My idea is to give him the highest honor. The National Science and Technology Progress Award, Special Prize, the National Medal. Give it all to him.</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned by these words. National medal that is the highest honor. Very few people are able to obtain it. But they had no objection to giving it to Lynch. Because of Lyn Shun, the Great Sa Kingdom entered the space age decades ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>It was also because of Lin Shan that the Great Sea Kingdom was able to completely break free from the days of being held hostage. He deserves these honors. General Jeang from the military headquarters immediately chimed in. I agree. Space fighter jets, lunar bases, space cities.</p>
<p>Aren&#x27;t these all game-changing projects? Giving him the highest honor is not only a reward but also a signal to all researchers. The others nodded in agreement. And another thing, the leader of the Ton Shu continued, is the establishment of an interstellar academy of sciences specifically responsible for research related to space exploration and interstellar development. Comrade Lin Shan was appointed as the chief scientist within the Academy of Sciences. He holds the highest authority.</p>
<p>No one, no department may interfere with his research decisions. This shocked everyone even more. The highest authority. This practically handed over the entire interstellar future of the great Sia Kingdom to Lin Chan. Could this be? Some people worry that the power is too great.</p>
<p>The leader of the Ton Shu interrupted him, saying, &quot;Trust those you employ, and don&#x27;t employ those you don&#x27;t trust.&quot; Comrade Lin Shens vision and ability are greater than we imagined. Moreover, Interstellar Exploration is a completely new field, and it must be decided by professionals. No one objected anymore. The awards ceremony is scheduled for 2 weeks from now. The location is the great hall of the people.</p>
<p>The protocol should be the highest level of etiquette. Furthermore, Comrade Lin Chin&#x27;s security level has been raised to the highest level. The next morning, the top news story on the great Sea Kingdom&#x27;s news broadcast. An announcement instantly went viral across the internet. A ceremony to award the nation&#x27;s highest honor will be held at the Great Hall of the People in 2 weeks, recognizing individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the nation&#x27;s scientific and technological development.</p>
<p>The announcement was very short. No names were mentioned, nor were specific contributions discussed. But the words, &quot;The highest national honor&quot; are enough to excite everyone. Holy crap, the highest honor. Who&#x27;s going to receive this? Could it be the team that previously developed controlled nuclear fusion? I feel there&#x27;s more than that.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s bound to be a surprise. Could it be the team from the space city project? It must be a big project. Otherwise, they wouldn&#x27;t have used the highest level of protocol. topic instantly went viral on Weibo&#x27;s trending searches. The highest honor in the great SEA kingdom was awarded directly reaching the top.</p>
<p>The comments section is full of speculation. Is it possible that it&#x27;s some hidden big shot? The Nanchin and the space carrier were technologies that suddenly appeared. Maybe there&#x27;s a super big shot behind him. No matter who it is, they are all the pride of our great sa kingdom. People have started to take stock of potential candidates from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering to research teams.</p>
<p>A long list was compiled, but no one is sure. After all, the weight of the highest honor is simply too great. The international internet was also in an uproar. Is the great Sea Kingdom preparing to announce the identity of a special individual? I don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;m actually kind of looking forward to it. I wonder which technological giant from the great SEA kingdom will be announced.</p>
<p>No matter what, they deserve our respect. The entire Blue Star Network is buzzing about this. The person who could warrant such a grand announcement from the Great Sea Kingdom must be a key figure in the recent technological explosion in the Great Sia Kingdom. Across the Pacific Ocean, an office, a familiar face looked at the announcement and fell into deep thought. What is the Great Sea Kingdom up to now? Is it possible that they are preparing to release some information? Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Trif stood to the side and explained in a low voice.</p>
<p>President, I suspect it may be related to the technological explosion in the great Sia Kingdom. Huang nodded. No matter what they do, we can only gather information on the surface. We absolutely must not send any agents into the Great Sea Kingdom. Understand? Huh? Trife was a little confused.</p>
<p>Mr. President, with such a good opportunity, shouldn&#x27;t we? Before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted. Fool, can&#x27;t you even see through such a simple scheme? The Great Sa Kingdom just wants to lure us into doing something and then find an excuse to deal with us. If we dare to cause trouble, the consequences will be dire. This Upon hearing this, Tri felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>He had just been thinking of taking this opportunity to investigate the important mission of the Great Sia Kingdom and then resolve it secretly. They never imagined that the great SEA kingdom had set a trap for them. The president is wise. Well just watch this time. Trif complimented at the same time.</p>
<p>India, should we send someone to investigate secretly? The secretary asked in a low voice. Are you stupid? The charlatan glared at the secretary. We&#x27;re trying to avoid the great Sia Kingdom right now, and you want to provoke them? Are you complaining that our Indian country is having too much of a comfortable time lately? After saying that, still not satisfied, he yelled, &quot;Get out of here. You&#x27;re fired.&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot; The secretary was completely dumbfounded. She was fired just because of one sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Your excellency, please give me a chance. I The secretary immediately knelt on the ground and begged for mercy.&quot; But the charlatan&#x27;s face was cold as he shouted at the door. &quot;Guards, come in right now and drag this guy away.&quot; Soon, the guards came in and dragged the secretary away. Only then did the charlatan breathe a sigh of relief. Do you still want to provoke the Great Sa Kingdom? What an idiot.</p>
<p>The charlatan muttered a few words, still not at ease. Then another order was issued. No department was allowed to investigate matters concerning the Great Sa Kingdom. It&#x27;s not just the US and India that reacted this way. Almost the entire Earth reacted the same way.</p>
<p>But there is one country that has a different idea. It&#x27;s the squid kingdom in the desert region.</p>
