            <p>Where does Vince Foster fit into this? Now, of course, those are all the suspicious facts that deal with Vince Foster&#x27;s death, but it gets worse. Promise is a case tracking software system. It was developed by a company that contracted with the DOJ called Insaw.

<p>and he was ultimately successful after he hired a former attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to handle the case. Richardson&#x27;s investigation and litigation earned him a court ruling that the government stole promise software and used it. Where does Vince Foster fit into this?
