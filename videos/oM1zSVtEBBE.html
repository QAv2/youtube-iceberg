            <p>all right hello everyone I&#x27;m Thomas and welcome to my channel I do educational videos and today we&#x27;re uh moving into the third uh video on the uh deductive outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system by Dewey B Larson this is a talk he gave in 1986 and uh it explains his his thought process and his development of the reciprocal system uh slowly but surely uh we made it up to the 13th uh deduction I guess and um we&#x27;re gonna start here at number 14. uh let me first say if you&#x27;d like to uh get a copy of uh uh either my book on uh the tree of life or a book on Jazz musicians in Chicago uh you can donate to me and uh minimum ten dollars and I&#x27;ll send you a copy of that book if you put it into your the venmo or cash app on the listed in the description and you put that in the memo um and uh just continue to stay tuned here for uh videos now where uh I&#x27;ve got all those Tree of Life videos up and I&#x27;m uh now starting to put in these reciprocal System videos if you&#x27;re a little bit confused about what&#x27;s going on here um go back to the beginning of the reciprocal System videos and uh hopefully that will fill you in a little bit at a time okay here&#x27;s number 14. once the primary units of motion are in existence units of inward scalar motion can be superimposed on the outward units the net magnitude of the two motions is zero and the combination therefore has no physical properties in a spatial reference system but it constitutes a base upon which other combinations can be formed okay now just remember uh in the prior video he had just gotten to talking about how the outward Motion in all directions at the speed of light called it the progression of the natural reference system that is the basis or the datum or the zero point uh for the universe neutral point and um but once you have these outward motions then you can start uh superimposing inward motions on those outward motions and right here he&#x27;s talking about you know one the progression is one unit of motion outwards and so then if you have this one unit of motion inward superimposed on it then what you really get is you get a base upon which other combinations can be formed it causes the rotational base but um so you don&#x27;t have anything but you have a base upon which to form something okay back to number 15 as stated in our definition motion is a progression thus it is not a succession of jumps even though it exists only in discrete units there is progression within the unit as well as unit by unit simply because the unit is a unit of motion or progression the significance of the discrete unit postulate is that discontinuity can occur only between units not within a unit but the various stages of the progression within a unit can be identified now uh Bruce Perrette puts in a footnote here it says Larson describes this progression as a moving chain versus a moving rope a chain can only be bent where the links join between units if the links are really tiny the chain looks like a rope but still behaves like a chain okay now number 16 the continuity of the progression within the units enables the existence of another type of scalar motion of physical locations this is a motion in which there is a continuous and uniform change from outward to Inward and vice versa that is a simple harmonic motion at this stage of the development only continuous processes are possible but a continuous change from outward to Inward and the inverse is just as permanent as a continuous outward or inward motion okay now this is a big point that uh Dr Bruce Perrette has with this and he puts in a footnote it has been argued that a simple harmonic motion being an accelerated motion cannot be primary nor continuous without the application of force professor kbk nehru um Perez partner more or less uh addresses this issue along with the alternate concept of by rotation in the paper the law of the conservation of Direction okay so this is a sticking point in the reciprocal system where Larson is talking about how this simple harmonic motion can be permanent because it is continuous um continuous change from outward to Inward and that it is a motion and motion itself is a progression so that Within a progressive motion uh you can have you have continuous processes but paret is saying that this is not continuous and it is not a primary motion because uh it&#x27;s a simple harmonic motion and it&#x27;s an accelerated motion um so it&#x27;s not either primary nor continuous and uh they this is really getting at the photon they&#x27;re looking at the photon as the simple harmonic motion that&#x27;s superimposed here um and Larson is saying that this Photon can be continuous because it itself is a motion and motion is is continuous and paret is saying no this is not how you can make a photon and uh nehru the the person that he cites there uh comes up with a different mechanism for the photon which is what he calls a by rotation a simple harmonic motion comes out of two rotating systems that are rotating in opposite directions when you put them together you get a one-dimensional wave and um so this this is really kind of like the major sticking point in the reciprocal system right here so for now we&#x27;re going to continue with Larson&#x27;s look at it at a later point we will uh we will incorporate nehru&#x27;s and perettes uh ideas about how you get the photon so we&#x27;re going to start here with uh our re resume here with number 17. and the two unit complete cycle of the simple harmonic motion the net change of the spatial position of the physical location is zero as represented in the spatial reference system the two unit combination remains stationary in the dimension of motion okay now on number 18 goes back to number 10 which number 10 has to do with um how the natural system of reference is progressing outward at unit speed relative to the spatial system of reference now from that number 18 says it follows that the physical location occupied by that motion combination which we just discussed moves outward at the speed of light in a second dimension and paret has a footnote here again uh all three scalar Dimensions defaults to unit speed the speed of light so with a direction reversal in just one dimension there are still two free Dimensions to carry the simple harmonic motion outward at the speed of light all motion that has a free Dimension will be observed as moving at the speed of light Okay so uh you know what we&#x27;re what we&#x27;re uh recognizing here is that there are three scalar dimensions and so um the photon is just the reversal of one of those scalar motions nullifying that dimension a reversal one of the dimensions but it still has the other two Dimensions moving outward at the speed of light so you still perceive uh this photon is moving outward at the speed of light uh even though it has nullified that outward motion but only in one dimension okay so now as you you might eventually guess that if you nullify that motion in all three dimensions then you know you end up moving your way toward having matter okay now number 19. the path of the combined progressions then takes the form of a sine curve and Perez has another footnote it has been argued that uh you know going back to number 15 the disc discontinuity can occur only between units not within a unit the path would be a square wave not a sine curve this is discussed in Neighbors paper that he cited just earlier so that is the difference uh paret and and nehru say that if you have uh the discontinuity between units then what you&#x27;re describing would be a square wave you know with right angle you know joints there as opposed to a smooth wave of simple harmonic motion Larson&#x27;s point is that um there is continuity be even uh within a unit or between units um because the units themselves are motion and motion is um by its very nature a progression and uh he says there is progression within the unit speed as well as unit by unit simply because the unit is a unit of motion the unit is a unit of motion a the unit is a unit of progression so thus it is not a succession of jumps even though it exists only in discrete units so that is the major sticking point here that has kind of put the reciprocal system back about 20 or 30 years from where it would be is Larson making a mistake there um or are paret and nehru making mistake uh in uh their attribution of disagree they&#x27;re disagreeing with Larson saying that there is discontinuity and so therefore you would not get a simple harmonic motion and so you are not describing a photon there um and so that that disagreement now Larson died in 1990 so um you know he didn&#x27;t really um peret didn&#x27;t really start uh this criticism and nehru didn&#x27;t even start this criticism until the 80s and so there wasn&#x27;t this kind of enough time I guess for them to Hash this out so you know especially uh in the case of peret neighbor who&#x27;s a professor uh and I think some kind of engineering professor over in India so he&#x27;s not really on the scene um this all this stuff is really occurring out west um the Isis headquarters the uh Institute for Society of unified science uh is out in Salt Lake City and um you know Larson is located out in Portland paret is was located in uh Wyoming uh some of the time in Salt Lake City some of the time so you know peret is is way more on the scene of you know the organization than nehru is and paret didn&#x27;t really start to grab hold of this until uh about the time that Larson was dying so uh peret has taken over the mantle but he he hasn&#x27;t really been able to you know hasn&#x27;t been able to get you know um some of the kind of the Orthodoxy of the larsonian&#x27;s uh interested or involved because you know Larson is dead and you know there&#x27;s a lot of people you know not a lot because there&#x27;s not a lot of people with any of this there&#x27;s uh this is these are small groups of people but there are people that think that Larson got this part right and there are some that think you got it wrong you know the only way to really you know decipher this is to do experiments and and you know paret attempted to do some of those and we&#x27;ll get into that later okay now um we were up to uh the path of the combined progression then takes the form of a sine curve Perez is saying that no it takes a square wave but Larson is saying that it&#x27;s a sine curve so we&#x27;re going on with Larson number 20.</p>
<p>we identify such scalar motion combination as photons a system of photons is electromagnetic radiation and then this is just a side comment this from Larson this derivation shows why radiation has the properties of a wave as well as those of particles it is composed of particles or discrete units but the motion or progression of these particles is wave-like okay number 21. the outward movement of physical locations due to the motion of the natural reference system relative to the stationary spatial system carries with it not only the photons but also any other physical entities that occupy such locations okay then another side point that Larson makes in addition to the photons there are certain other massless particles that have no known motion producing mechanism and must therefore remain stationary in the natural system of reference unless acted upon by some Outside Agency there are also objects very distant galaxies that do have emotion producing mechanism uh gravitation but are so far away that the gravitational motion toward our location has been reduced to negligible levels all of these objects behave exactly as required by the theory That&#x27;s History uh that is they move outward relative to the spatial reference system at the speed of light okay now um I&#x27;m gonna stop there uh because that&#x27;s kind of a grouping and he&#x27;s moving into like a uh somewhat of a different uh Direction here uh where he&#x27;s he&#x27;s talking about the photons themselves so we&#x27;ll get into that um next time now this all this stuff can be very cumbersome and it it&#x27;s very confusing especially for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t really know where they&#x27;re standing with this this video might work a lot better um in the future when you uh already have a decent idea of the reciprocal system and how it works and then you can kind of look into the the debates that are being had and it you know that is why it&#x27;s difficult to present the reciprocal system because it it&#x27;s hard to present it in the first place but then in the second place uh you have this competing system that is um uh revising some of the various points uh that Larson is hanging his hat on but I think it&#x27;s important to uh to kind of see how they&#x27;re thinking about this and how they&#x27;re approaching it um you know if this is not uh what you&#x27;re looking for just ignore these videos and in a in a week or two we will be done with this particular um article and we will be going into the metaphysical aspects of the theory which are uh at least more familiar with for most people and uh you can start to learn the theory that way but I think it is also important at least for some people including me to um kind of understand the origins and to be able to kind of see the progression of the thinking Larson is difficult to follow because he uh he doesn&#x27;t necessarily repeat himself that often so he kind of he says it once he assumes that you got it um and uh sometimes when he says it it&#x27;s in buried in the middle of a long obstruse paragraph so he makes it hard on you but we&#x27;re going to work through it and we will see you next time have a great day</p>
