            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Stanford Professor Dr Gary Nolan says that we know how to call them meaning the aliens right we now know how to communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence right that&#x27;s should be a bombshell right that should be a huge story all over the news if that&#x27;s the case that we know how to connect with them call them what whatever terms you want to use make a connection with another species right wherever they&#x27;re from whoever they are we now have that connection but I guess the question I would ask is who exactly are we connecting with the the information is out there we you know it&#x27;s already pretty well understood I mean look there&#x27;s been enough whistleblower types where the information of how to do this has leaked out you know we we we know how to call them whe whether you believe in iics or not uh it seems to be part of the process uh so we we know how to call them the question is not can you video them Ian skywatcher has already shown that you can video them uh and there&#x27;ll be more of that kind of stuff I think coming in the future um you know so skywatcher is one group of several that I&#x27;m aware of uh that are doing it independently so that&#x27;s citizen science I mean I think the answer is you don&#x27;t wait for the government to do it for you don&#x27;t wait for Daddy or Mommy to tell you what&#x27;s going on you just do it yourself because as long as you&#x27;re not going out there with with guns or energy weapons trying to pull something down and you know get yourself in a bad situation there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no reason people can&#x27;t do it themselves and organize so um you know that&#x27;s that I think is the threat in a way that one needs to use against the governmental authorities who think that they hold all the all the all the marbles at this point they don&#x27;t anymore because the people been in the program like Jake and others who&#x27;ve you know made that statement publicly uh have uh basically made their um knowledge and ability public so do it now where did I come across this video clip um this is um was presented by the soul Foundation but actually came across it on Twitter from this tweet right here that you could see and um shout out to uh neand Drew Thal um it says Gary Nolan says there are more groups doing what skywatchers is doing right now we know how to call them quote skywatcher is one group of several that I&#x27;m aware of that are doing it independently right and then actually Gary Nolan responded and he said this I would edit your comment Gary Nolan says more groups are doing what skywatcher is doing right now and by that I meant precisely the calling as you noted skywatcher is an intensely focused group of people who Beyond advoca ways to allegedly quote call them have the means to collect scientific data in ways others are not and will not because I am designing some of them many groups use one or another means of intent to allegedly call groups such as the tesos collect data at sites they feel are hotspots skywatcher is the only group I know of with a comprehensive approach that will lead the field which is why I&#x27;m focused on working with them so this is very interesting one he clarifies a little bit about what&#x27;s going on right but there&#x27;s a few things to take away from all of this right one that there is a definitive protocol or knowledge of how to connect with these craft like there&#x27;s no more is this possible they&#x27;re already in the camp of it&#x27;s possible and this is how you do it right again we&#x27;re talking about connecting calling right these non-human intelligence or whatever they are From Another Dimension time travel or whatever but nonhumans right so that&#x27;s kind of interesting I don&#x27;t know if I guess I haven&#x27;t reached that point but they clearly must have information I don&#x27;t have right and I guess that&#x27;s the whole point of this is to spend the next however months or years bringing this information out right and skywatcher is something we&#x27;ve covered quite a bit on this channel right that&#x27;s Jake Barber The Whistleblower came out on news Nation back in January and his team um and they are claiming to bring disclosure within the next 12 months that was from January right sometime at the end of 2025 or beginning of 2026 right um where they are going to release the data they collect from contacting these craft and potentially the craft itself right cuz they can bring it down and control it with their mind so basically Gary&#x27;s implying there are other groups like them I don&#x27;t know who those are to be honest with you if he just means like C5 groups or something I don&#x27;t know um but skywater is like a team put together with that sole purpose right so and he&#x27;s working with them and the other thing that I took away from this uh tweet comment from Gary Nolan is that he is designing some of the equipment Andor protocols for which they will collect the scientific data from these experiments they&#x27;re doing so that&#x27;s interesting right what sort of new ways is Gary Nolan coming up with to collect this data right is it or is it not a new way but a way to collect data that isn&#x27;t normally used in that way does that make sense so he&#x27;s found a new A New U function for something that otherwise would not have worked right so I don&#x27;t know this is very interesting um how this is going to play out so what do you think right do we know how to call them is that definitive right and he is saying like go out and do it yourself I I I understand right go out and do it yourself you don&#x27;t need anything just don&#x27;t shoot him down right I mean that seems like a that seems like not a very what&#x27;s the best way to put this like that also seems a little dangerous right like well yeah go out and contact these non-humans but hey don&#x27;t shoot them down we&#x27;re hope we&#x27;re going to hopefully keep your word on that right like I mean that could start an Intergalactic war and we&#x27;re just like trusting that people won&#x27;t step outside of the bounds of that how do we know that one person going out into a field doing this on themselves doesn&#x27;t start some you know like I said Intergalactic war or something right like shouldn&#x27;t there be like a process for trying to connect with these entities like a waiting list or only certain people should be able to do it or I don&#x27;t know it just seems dangerous to that that&#x27;s the way it can be done I mean would you just go connect with the lion on the serengetti you know what I mean like or is it just a little rabbit we don&#x27;t know you know what if I told you hey I&#x27;m gonna put you inside of a room pitch black you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in there but you&#x27;re G to connect with another entity would you not be worried well it could be a bear or it could be a little you know whatever little rodent little something little squirrel or something you know what I mean like there&#x27;s no way for us to know what this thing is and what damage it could cause and what it could do so I am so cautious of that right and get we got to take risks but isn&#x27;t the whole point to try to mitigate the risk as much as we can so with that said you know I&#x27;m I&#x27;m kind of being a hypocrite myself because we do need to study this right that&#x27;s sort of my own argument implies that we need to look into this and we need to study this to find more out about it so maybe making those connection Protocols are a little safer right so I get it we should be looking into this we should be collecting the data I look forward to what skywatcher is going to put out with the help of Gary Nolan I mean you know what I mean can&#x27;t really complain if they&#x27;re out there doing the hard work to bring us this information we can do it what with it what we want but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m here for it let&#x27;s see what happens right so let me know what you guys think in the in the comments about this and uh we&#x27;ll see you guys in the next video remember V us every day is a gift y&#x27;all peace [Music]</p>
