            <p>there there were no red flags for me to sit there and think like oh this is the criminal or this is some uh fugitive that&#x27;s on the run you know or stuff like that um this guy just looked like a dude in a in a BDU uniform or battle dress uniform like I had so anyway but now I&#x27;m looking at him straight on I&#x27;m like holy crap this dude does not look human you you go where were we you go up and now is it is this where you actually have the yeah and and it&#x27;s on the way to courtz Mountain that um I have the encounter um and what happened well um play by play I am sitting there in the vehicle um I&#x27;ve got the driver he&#x27;s the ranking individual we&#x27;re in the lead vehicle and I&#x27;m sitting right behind the driver and then there&#x27;s you&#x27;re in the back seat I&#x27;m in the back seat okay is it a four-door truck it&#x27;s a four-door truck so they didn&#x27;t give you a shotgun come on no they didn&#x27;t give me a shotgun I did not I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t yell at soon enough the other guy got it he got shotgun nose goes yes so I sucked that day so um yeah and then the guy in the front uh right in the passenger side and then there&#x27;s a another person to my right a young lady to my right so anyway we&#x27;re just traveling as we normally do um with with at least two cars behind you with at least two other cars behind us in the Convoy and um we always Convoy just in case somebody does break a axle or whatever we can pick them up uh anyway um so there&#x27;s this guy in her uniform looks like he&#x27;s coming down the the left hand shoulder of the road how far away uh we noticed him when he was about a football field away okay and he&#x27;s kind of like standing there and then he he saw us and he started like running towards us and he had this funny look to his his running it was like he was falling forward all the time or like he was running against a really strong wind is he is he from far away though as you&#x27;re first seeing him is he running in a way that would suggest oh seems like a human yes somewhat yeah he he looked about human size and everything else yeah everything he just looked like he he had a uniform on like mine and uh he was just running towards us and as we approach uh that&#x27;s when I noticed his skin had this blue tint to it like he was hypmic that&#x27;s what I thought my immediate thought was that he was hypothermic hypothermic and he needed help so it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s white skin but it&#x27;s turned like almost the blood&#x27;s rushing it&#x27;s not like a dark ocean blue or something like no it&#x27;s definitely not dark navy blue or anything no this is just like you I we&#x27;re cold cold as all get out and we&#x27;re starting to freeze that&#x27;s what it looked like to me that that level of blue was like holy crap you know that was the level of blue it wasn&#x27;t because he was like dark blue or anything it was just this undertone of blue so anyway um we get closer and closer and he&#x27;s only a few feet away from the car and we&#x27;re slowing down and the guy in the front seat just that&#x27;s where I mentioned in the the the film with you that that&#x27;s when he screams out that he&#x27;s got no ears uh the guy in the front seat and I&#x27;m like uh the guy in the front seat that sitting next to the driver yeah the passenger side guy in the front seat says he&#x27;s got no ears and I&#x27;m thinking how rude you know this guy&#x27;s probably fighting for his life here hypothermic and you&#x27;re talking about his ears you know so I&#x27;m popping open the door I&#x27;m trying to take my jacket off at the same time because I&#x27;m thinking I got to wrap him at something cuz he&#x27;s hypothermic and that&#x27;s when I step out onto the roadway and I&#x27;m shutting the door and that&#x27;s when I I look up at him and I&#x27;m realizing he has no ears and his eyes are are twice as big than normal and he does indeed have this blue uh tint and that&#x27;s when I felt like really scared because I was like oh crap what did I walk into here um how close is he to you now he&#x27;s only like 3 feet he&#x27;s like oh he&#x27;s right in front of you it&#x27;s like you know me and Jame James apart um is he looking you in the eyes not immediately he kind of as I&#x27;m shutting the door and he realizes that I&#x27;m about ready to engage with him he was he was like looking at the driver I don&#x27;t know what he was thinking about doing but maybe he was going to hail him or knock on the window I don&#x27;t know are you looking to see if he&#x27;s armed no no no I&#x27;m just more concerned for his health okay at that point because if he&#x27;s on the Range you know I&#x27;m thinking he&#x27;s in a uniform you know there there were no red flags for me to sit there and think like oh this is the criminal or this is some uh fugitive that&#x27;s on the Run you know or stuff like that um this guy just looked like a dude in a in a BDU uniform or battle dress uniform like I had so anyway but now I&#x27;m looking at him straight on I&#x27;m like holy crap this dude does not look human and I&#x27;m starting to get really scared but then he talks to me and that calms me down because he I had to respond and um he&#x27;s he&#x27;s wanting to fix and repair his craft and he&#x27;s asking for that material that t him what did his voice sound like it was not English at all he did have an auditory he spoke but it sounded more like Norwegian or something like that so you couldn&#x27;t understand what he spoke but you could understand what he was saying because there was something telepathic going on right I could understand what he was saying regardless of what he was actually saying what was he saying he was saying you know My My Craft is damaged I need some material to repair it do you have any tenium and I was like is that titanium he&#x27;s like no and so I was like well you know pointed over to the Dreamland you know Groom Lake and I said those people might have some high-tech medals and things like that and this wave of emotion hits me like disgust like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not asking people like you know barbarians for that from him he&#x27;s saying yeah he&#x27;s he&#x27;s saying this and I&#x27;m getting that telepathic emotion of his being disgusted about it me even mentioning it are you at all looking at the guys at any point here who are with you yeah I I I tended to look over a couple of times and and what are they doing they look like they were just zoned like zombies like I almost laughed really they looked that they looked comical like you know just totally literally like the Men In Black movie where people are stunned yeah and they&#x27;re just yeah you know just kind of like they&#x27;re just zoned out y that&#x27;s what they look like so um anyway uh I look at them a couple of times and he keeps talking to me was the driver did the driver have the window down or the window up sorry does the driver I think at one point he did start rolling his window down but when he saw my door was opening up he I think he rolled it back up because it was freaking cold and he probably wanted to you know stop the cold air from coming in so I think maybe the window was down partially maybe yeah he could have but I don&#x27;t really remember to tell you the truth are you now you&#x27;re reacting to what&#x27;s happening right here and you&#x27;re having this communication so there&#x27;s like a lot of Senses going on here right but first of all how long is this full encounter with him we&#x27;re going to get to long it couldn&#x27;t have been more than 5 minutes okay is there a point in there where you are like holy [ __ ] I&#x27;m talking to a [ __ ] alien well yeah after I I realized this guy&#x27;s talking another language I&#x27;m I&#x27;m being preoccupied by his constant talking to me and um yeah I I I got the distinct impression that I was like in a holy crap situation so yeah I I I felt definitely that there was definitely that this person was not human I&#x27;ve never been talked to by James or you or you telepathically like that and if you have another language as your first language and still understanding you I&#x27;ve never had that happen before or since so how does it end you talk for five minutes what happens um he ends up going back to his craft he gets into it and as he&#x27;s traveling above the roadway and travels off in the South to Southeast range uh of the range and HS it&#x27;s kind of towards Vegas actually and um he just takes off and then everybody in the car finally is coming to and they don&#x27;t have that zonked out look anymore what does the craft look like by the way you you did share it in the program documentary Link in description below go check it out great documentary James but what does it look like it&#x27;s kind of got a bulbous cockpit and it&#x27;s got like a little pad or foot footprint thing that comes off of it m that how big um it can hold like two people like a cockpit of fight fighter jet had you ever seen anything like it before never I I mean I you&#x27;re talking to a guy along with the other people in the convoys that were there the week before you literally when you do the red flag exercises you see all these craft not just your own in in our inventory in the American inventory but we are actually helping our allies to train also with us so we literally knew what the bombers the fighters the every type of of aircraft we already knew what they look like and this fit none of it m and that&#x27;s exactly the feeling I had cuz it had a bulb like a egg-shaped cockpit that was about the same size as a normal fighter jet cockpit would look like it has this red or not red but black uh pancake egg that&#x27;s flat it&#x27;s about a foot or foot and a half wide sticking out the back where the like if it was a helicopter it would have been the tail of the helicopter and then you know you see those helicopters that have like a big rounded canopy or whatever where the pilots sit yes that&#x27;s kind of what it looked like but it was all white except for this black pancake how I think you just said this I I I might have missed this how far away was the craft from where you guys were first talking with him 50 yards 50 yards so you when when you&#x27;re talking with him did you notice the craft in the background like were you looking at that at all yeah cuz uh when I was getting out of the the the car I definitely looked to my left as well and uh that&#x27;s when I saw it full on was the craft parked on the road or in the desert it was in the desert it was off the road cuz as we were traveling you know this is the road towards Quartz Mountain yeah the craft was off to the side of the road off the shoulder of the road in the in the desert do you think you&#x27;d be able to take us back to that exact location I could point exactly where it was I could get you probably within about 10 feet okay so he goes back how how did the conversation End by the way like what was the last thing he just well when I mentioned uh talking to those people and he got disgusted did it it ended pretty quick after that but uh I just like I&#x27;m getting the [ __ ] out of here yeah well he just said no that&#x27;s not going to work and I said well the only other people I could think of as I go to college down in downtown Vegas because I was going to the Community College and I was like I I knew a geophysical professor and I&#x27;m like maybe he&#x27;s got a metal or just specialist friend of his and I was like maybe they have a professor down there and he&#x27;s like okay and were you were were you speaking were you speaking English to him yeah had to speak English so you weren&#x27;t thinking things you were speaking I was speaking Yeah Yeah okay but he understood he understood but he&#x27;s speaking back to you telepathically yes but but was his mouth moving like gibberish coming out of his mouth he&#x27;s speaking like Norwegian yeah it&#x27;s kind of like if I could talk to you and I could say something like uh in Spanish you know like uh the arms but a dualingo in my head is giv me English yeah and but at the same time I was saying it in Spanish yeah you&#x27;re understanding everything I said that I got you okay so he goes back to the crap now the craft had a problem with it he said he needed some [ __ ] but he takes off in it yeah when it takes off does it make any noise um yeah kind of like a a strange sort of uh I don&#x27;t know how to put it what could I equate it to it&#x27;s kind of like you ever hear your your fan belt squeaking in your car yes like it&#x27;s kind of like that yeah okay so any any Wings any propeller blades zero so it just moves up straight yeah it kind of takes off like this and then as he he starts traveling horizontally he&#x27;s going up in like stair steps cuz he had a he had an issue with the craft right and I think it was just when he was doing vertical gaining altitude or losing altitude that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the part that was broken and then at some point he disappears from view right yeah he just takes off and goes out of view all right now you&#x27;re now no longer Zed guys are standing there right well they&#x27;re all in the car nobody else got out of their cars um but they were Z you were saying when they had the zon look they&#x27;re in the car they&#x27;re in the car and I just I I and as the guy is traveling back and I&#x27;m getting back in the car they all come too and then everybody seems to be normal and um does anyone say what the [ __ ] was that I was just about to ask that question no nobody is talking about it and I&#x27;m like did you guys see that and they&#x27;re like no yeah they&#x27;re like no and I&#x27;m like okay well let&#x27;s just get to work all right wait a second was it a no like no because whatever the [ __ ] we just saw we can never talk about cuz that shit&#x27;s crazy or was like the guy the ranking guy I think he saw it I know he I know he saw some of it because he was the only one that flat out said no and don&#x27;t talk about it so you think that they maybe I&#x27;m putting words in your mouth right here you think that at least some of them may have had some lost time on this yes and for people out there can you explain what lost time is that&#x27;s just a portion of time where um you either go you&#x27;re either physically hit in the head and you can&#x27;t remember or some other means like you&#x27;ve hear hear from abduction scenarios from other people where somehow these creatures are able to you know turn you off for that amount of time and then I&#x27;ve heard from other people that there&#x27;s actually maybe even a time space kind of phenomenon that&#x27;s encountered with other craft where their radios turn off and all the electrics in their car turn off and then they get you know they they have missing time but at the same time they feel like uh nothing happened you said something really interesting in the program which I loved I mean I just it really resonated with me that when you made eye contact with this this thing this Bean Critter person whatever M that you almost had this snake bite like what was that what did that that was the very part first part of the conversation because that was when I shut the door and I looked up and I was like I and you got eyes with him right and you and I locked eyes and it was the strangest freaking set of eyes I&#x27;d ever seen it was like a crocodile was freaking looking at me and my my fear Instinct just went spiked I was like holy crap you know like a bolt of adrenaline going through you oh [ __ ] yeah I Was Fear did you were you SC it was it was definite fear I was like holy crap this is this guy&#x27;s not he&#x27;s he&#x27;s an alien I was like you know um so you look like you were looking into a crocodile&#x27;s eyes yeah it was kind of the same thing you get if you stumble onto a rattlesnake that&#x27;s what it felt like I mean you just scared to death you&#x27;re like oh crap you know that&#x27;s what I felt but you didn&#x27;t feel threatened in the sense that you your well-being was was at stake here was a sentient being that I couldn&#x27;t explain if you could imagine that kind of scenario just like you know the first time you you&#x27;re scuba diving and you and you meet a whale for the first time you&#x27;re like you know that kind of feeling but you know what the whale is yeah and eventually you calm down and you realize that yeah it&#x27;s a whale and it&#x27;s gentle and it doesn&#x27;t bother you but you never figured out what this thing was no I did not what happen so you get in the car they kind of come too you&#x27;re like did you just see that some guys are like no what happens next you guys just drive back to wherever you&#x27;re going well we had to be at Black Mountain by a certain time to start our equipment up and everything else so that was the foremost in our mind or everybody else&#x27;s mind I was still reeling from the whole thing that I had just experienced you driving in silence I&#x27;m just like holy crap what just happened you know kind of Just sh in shock complete shock and um then we get to the Black Mountain we crank up our Gear start working our job and we we finish out the day and we go back to the hotel and uh only the guy only the ranking guy was the one that I know remember some of it at least because I I talked to him later on what where like how did that at lunchtime um I had a very strange compunction I don&#x27;t know what the hell it was cold as heck out there but I wanted to go eat my lunch outside there was like a compelling something that told me go when you got to the place yeah when we got to Black Mountain yeah so I ate lunch and I walked down and this is where my missing time comes in I walked down about you know 100 100 50 ft down the road from the top of Black Mountain and I don&#x27;t remember anything watching the video guys if you haven&#x27;t already subscribed please smash that subscribe
