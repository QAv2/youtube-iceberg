            <p>welcome back guys to the lonard acoustic cavitation reactor design right off the bat the goal here is to use lowcost economical stuff that people can buy on eBay or machine themsel and we want to make this open source the main aspects of this design we&#x27;ve got very high Purity let&#x27;s say 99.9 plus nickel wire going from input to output on a little spool the nickel wire is going to be pulled through essentially like cord grips that are going to seal on the pressure we&#x27;re going to slide it through there so we&#x27;ve got to have the wire be thick enough to handle being pulled through those board grips probably put like two little midoo micrometer adjusters on there for this project so that we can get that wire exactly where it needs to be in that cavitation implosion our ultrasonic horn is going to be designed so it has a concave top to it okay so it&#x27;s going to be an acoustic lens and then the opposite face is another matching concave acoustic lens so it&#x27;s a little hemisphere that bottom one&#x27;s going to be adjustable is what I&#x27;m thinking so we&#x27;ll fix the top one with its own cord grip so that that acoustic energy can travel through here and not just end up going into our manifold block That acoustic energy will go to that sonol luminescent implosion site we can adjust that focusing with this bottom acoustic lens adjustment we&#x27;ve got our 300 PSI safety valve here so I don&#x27;t in this experiment let&#x27;s look at the controls so we got 120 bolts coming in our control box with Raspberry Pi in it nice big computer screen so we can see all of our Excel data and our python code that&#x27;s going to run to control this thing</p>
