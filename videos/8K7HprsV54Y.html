            <p>Our kinder, gentler, more supportive world will form into being when a large minority of our population realizes that we don&#x27;t live in an objective physical reality. We just believe that we do. Consciousness, not matter, is fundamental. And our science is on the threshold of figuring that out. 100 years ago, physics experienced a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>Physicists created the science of quantum physics to better understand and explain the double slit experiment. They were ecstatic about this new breakthrough.</p>
