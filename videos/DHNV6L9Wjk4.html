            <p>all right hello everyone and welcome to my channel this is a channel for educational purposes and uh today is our 465th video on Dewey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory the reciprocal system of theory is a theory of everything or a generalized theory that um was proposed first by Mr Larsen back in 1959 with his two fundamental postulates and from there he deduced a theoretical Universe what the universe would look like if his postulates were correct and uh he wrote some books comparing his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical universe of the Legacy scientists and we&#x27;re looking at one of those books today called basic properties of matter this has to do with chemistry and we are in the middle of chapter 7 that is called uh temperature relations now Mr Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system is also known as a the universe of motion Larson was uh not the first person to propose a universe made out of motion as opposed to to matter or energy but I think he was the first to um get traction and get some have some success with that approach and one of the main reasons that he had success is that he was um able to Define motion uh more specifically as the relationship between space and time so the universe is made out of Mo motion and motion is the relationship between space and time uh now you can uh dispute that if you want and and this also leads to um a reciprocal relationship between space and time for Larson motion was a fraction with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator and so that is a reciprocal relationship now the most basic example of of motion uh that we know of is speed the bicycle is moving 12 miles hour 12 miles of space and 1 hour of time uh that is space over time speed and if we double the space if we double the speed we can now say uh the bicycle&#x27;s now moving 24 mph but we also could say and it would be equivalent that the bicycle is now moving 12 mil per half hour you can multiply the space by two or you can divide the time by two that uh evinces a um reciprocal relationship but Larsson spreads it out not only just to speed but all forms of motion um really all scientific phenomena are kinds of motion mass is a kind of motion energy is a kind of motion pressure is a kind of motion surface tension is the kind of motion power is a kind of motion acceleration and force are kinds of motion and they all have their time space signatures for example force is time over space to the second power uh matter is time to the third power over space to the third power and so on so uh that&#x27;s really where Larson Starts Now when he is referring to motion he is referring to a um more generalized kind of motion that he calls scalar motion scalar motion has been um you know uh noticed and acknowledged by scientists but they have not recognized its importance um Larsson puts it at the center of the story but a scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction you can Envision a scalar motion using a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other every dot is moving away from every other Dot and in fact every location on that balloon is moving away from every other location on the balloon uh so every dot is moving in every direction no specific Direction and this is a scalar motion the motion of that outward balloon Larson refers to as the progression and the inward motion if you were to contract the balloon would be analogous to gravitation um now really his progression that outward motion of the balloon is really like the source of the reciprocal system this is the motion that the universe is built upon and uh you have to if you are going to have a universe of motion you have to be able to um buy into the concept of motion without anything moving motion precedes anything that would be moving and motion in fact comprises anything that would be moving and so this motion is um moving outward and kind of the uh it is eternal and omnipresent it occurs in all spaces and all locations at all times and then so you could think of it kind of like as a zero point and then uh by harnessing that motion we build up you know particles matter Aggregates of matter and so on and that&#x27;s really done by reversing the flow of the progression that outward flow and turning it into the inward flow which is gravitation and gravitation is really the essence of atoms and and matter the gravitation is inherent to the matter it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with attraction to other matter every uh it&#x27;s just like being on the surface of a Contracting balloon all of the dots are moving toward each other but they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not being pulled by any um any of the other dots they are all pursuing their own course but they all happen to be moving toward each other so that&#x27;s kind of uh the framework now let&#x27;s um just go over larsson&#x27;s two fundamental postulates and then we can get into some of this reading so the uh larsson&#x27;s First Fundamental postula is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time and the second postulate is that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian that second postulate is basically what he uses to take that first postulate and to create his theoretical Universe from it so you take the first postulate and then you uh go through a process of if this then that if this then that but the the what is between the this and the that is mathematical probability geometrical considerations and logic so um those are his postulates we&#x27;ve got a three-dimensional universe space time and motion all come in three dimensions space time and motion all come in discret units um and the progression that outward movement that is the source of everything is at the rate of one unit of space per one unit of time Larson calls that unit speed it&#x27;s also known as the speed of light and that progression at the speed of light in all directions from all locations at all times uh LaRon refers to as the progression of the natural reference system so we have a spatial reference system that&#x27;s stationary and a temporal reference system that&#x27;s stationary these both uh you know the spatial reference system that stationaries three dimensions of space XYZ coordinates Larson calls that coordinate space and it&#x27;s accompanied by clock time the clock is progressing still in a scaler manner so in a gravitationally bound system you have this stationary reference system and in a uh kind of a reciprocal gravitational environment you have this uh temporal reference frame by extrapolation from the reciprocal postulate space and time being reciprocals that means the space of time have the same qualities so time also has three dimensions in a still frame and space is progressing space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart in the temporal stationary temporal reference system so you have these two stationary reference systems one of three-dimensional space one of three-dimensional time but each one is only going to be able to occupy one dimension of motion so there there are three dimensions of motion so the three dimensions of motion cannot be um properly represented in a a stationary reference system but Larson has this natural reference system from which he makes his uh assessments and his measurements so he&#x27;s using the natural reference system and really saying that the scientists are getting it all wrong or at least partially wrong because they&#x27;re using the wrong reference system they&#x27;re using the stationary reference system which is only applicable to certain environments of the Universe um okay and um so what this really sets up is several different sectors of the universe you have this uh outward motion at the speed of light in all directions from all times and places and that is this midpoint of the Universe on one side you have the uh what Lar calls the cosmic sector that is uh faster than the speed of light motion and you have the material sector which is slower than the speed of light motion and then within the material sector you have what he calls the time region this is an inside region within the material sector where space is less than one unit again you have the discrete unit postulate everything has to be at at least one unit and so uh if space is not one full unit uh we&#x27;re talking about microscopic type of situations then there is no Motion in space because you can&#x27;t get less than one unit so you have only Motion in time but an outward Motion in time is equivalent to an inward Motion in space so if two particles are approaching each other to one unit of space they get to be they get to be one unit apart but then they can&#x27;t approach each other any closer in space so what they do is they move outward in time and outward in time is the equivalent of inward in space we see it as inward in space but it is really happening in time but we don&#x27;t see time we only see space in a spatial reference system the same thing has happened uh in uh reciprocal form in the cosmic sector within the cosmic sector uh within one unit of time um two Cosmic particles or atoms cannot approach each other any closer than one unit of time so they move apart in space which is the equivalent of moving inward in time and um atoms and partic atoms and Aggregates of atoms uh basically come from reversing that outward motion of the progression to an inward motion like a gravitation and it has to be done through first reversing the progression and then rotating it backwards in three dimensions and that is um a fairly detailed process but that&#x27;s the short version the reversal is called the photon and then if you reverse and then you rotate the photon then you end up having a sub subatomic particle and then when you combine two subatomic particles then you can get up to an atom and an atom is denoted by Larson with a three number um series a b and c a is the first twodimensional rotation B is the second two-dimensional rotation that alternates with the first and C is a an optional one-dimensional rotation in the opposite direction of the first two and that is um can be positive negative or zero it is zero in the U noble gases and um so for example um oxygen oxygen is denoted by Larson as 2 2 -2 two uh two-dimensional primary rotations two secondary two-dimensional rotations and two negative um one-dimensional rotations so that is its you know signature in Larson&#x27;s system and Larson takes those numbers and from them he um deduces uh various these basic properties of matter kind of uh uh and those come uh he starts with compression and heat compression uh when you move into the time region of the space region the rules reverse just like they do when you cross that unit speed boundary when you cross the unit space or unit time boundaries you also have to rever reverse the rules and so now the progression is moving inward in equivalent space and gravitation is moving outward whereas in the you know uh the normal progression is moving outward and gravitation is moving Inward and by that those reversal of directions you are able to establish an interatomic equilibrium at the point where the gravitation is equal to the progression the progression is constant and you know omnipresent and eternal whereas gravitation is uh variable but there is a certain point where they are equal and that is what lson calls the interatomic distance between atoms and at that interatomic equilibrium then there can be internal pressure which is from the progression that is uh called compression or an internal or a rotational um motion out outward motion that he refers to as heat and so those two uh those are two factors that come into play that Adams deal with and so he deduces kind of the various relations from that we&#x27;ll start here on uh in chapter 7 uh he was just talking about potassium in particular uh he was talking about its specific heat curve and the specific heat is the amount of heat that you have to add to something to raise it by a certain temperature um so it&#x27;s kind of like the efficiency of heat uh transfer and um this is based on the rotational uh levels that Larsson assigns to these atoms which is based on their periodic table numbers ABC numbers and he says that in pottassium the thermal factors are 211 and it maintains the same factor throughout this entire solid range as indicated in chapter 5 the endpoint temperature of this type of curve is 9.32 times the temperature of the first transition point now it&#x27;s important to note that one of the findings of the reciprocal system is that temperature is a uh is quantized just like everything else all the units are quantized um and that um the temperature belongs to the atom or molecule it is not a uh something of of of an aggregate of atoms each atom has its own temperature and the aggregate temperature is just kind of like the average of all of the molecules but each one has its own temperature and they follow specific curves um and um make their V various transitions uh where they are trying to avoid getting to the melting point because uh there anything that&#x27;s three dimensions in the solid state is in the solid is in um well three dimensions in the solid three dimensions in the time region is the solid state when it emerges from one dimension of the time region into the what he calls a time space region which is the rest of the material sector then it becomes a liquid but because uh probability relations solids are more probable than liquids so a solid is going to do whatever it can to avoid having to change into a liquid and so it makes these transitions which makes it harder for the heat to uh change the uh to move it closer to the um to The Melting Point boundary so you can put in uh when it makes its first transition it basically increases its slope by a factor of eight so it makes it eight that you have to add eight times more heat to make it uh uh move any closer to the melting point line okay so and he evaluated these different uh curves depending on how many transitions are made and for this potassium kind of curve which I think is uh uh makes three transitions um 9.32 times the temperature of the first transition point so that&#x27;s kind of the first transition point is somewhat of a reference point um and then the other transition points are including the melting point are um factors of that first transition point so in uh in the potassium type of curve U the temperature is 9.32 times what the temperature of the first transition point is and he says this leads to an endpoint temperature of 336° the measured melting point is 337° that&#x27;s Kelvin uh in absolute temperature scale so the measured melting point is 337° Kelvin and um the difference there is because when something leaves the uh solid state that is not um actually the origin of the liquid state because again temperature is quantized so once you get to be a liquid you have to you have to also get to the next Quantum l level of the original the initial Quantum level of a liquid so the end of the solid state isn&#x27;t going to get you to the first level of the liquid so the end of the solid state in this case is 336° but the beginning of the liquid state is 337° the measured melting point is 337° in this case then the solid end point and the melting point happen to coincide within the limits of the accuracy of the investigation chlorine an element only two steps lower on the atomic series than potassium but a member of the next lower group um and you know one of the uh I guess uh what are those called um H halogens uh has the lower type of specific heat curve with Nal two only as opposed to three so the endpoint temperature of this curve is 4.56 on the relative scale where the first transition point is one the thermal factors that determine the transition point and are applicable to the first segment of the curve are 421 but if these factors are applied to the end point they lead to an impossibly high temperature it is thus apparent that the factors applicable to the second segment of the curve are lower than those applicable to the first segment in line with the previously noted tendency toward a decrease in the thermal factors with increasing temperature uh the indicated factors applicable to the end point in this case are the same 211 combination that we found in pottassium they correspond to an endpoint temperature of 164° Kelvin just below the melting point at 170 as the theory requires next we look at two curves of the N equals 4 type the end point of which is at a relative temperature of 1787 times that of the trans first transition point on the basis of the thermal factors 461 the absolute temperature of the end point is 1,765 De Kelvin uh which is uh What atom is he looking at here uh he doesn&#x27;t even say yet okay he&#x27;s looking at two two different atoms with curves of the N equals 4 type okay the uh absolute temperature of the N Point is 1765 de Kelvin which is consistent with the melting points of both Cobalt at 1768 and iron at 1808 or 18 yeah 1808 um here too the indicated factors at the end point are lower than those applicable to the first segment of the specific heat curve but in this case there is independent evidence of the decrease Cobalt which has the factors 482 in the first segment is already down to 461 at the second transition Point while iron uh the initial factors of which are four uh 462 has reached uh I guess maybe okay 482 has reached 462 at this point with two more segments of the curve in which to make the additional reduction okay now you can kind of see that larsson&#x27;s kind of out in the weeds here talking about some very you know somewhat Technical and and Arcane um matters having to do with uh specific elements in the periodic table but just keep in mind that the reciprocal system is a generalized Theory of Everything and so the same principles that are oper operative here when we&#x27;re talking about chemistry are also relevant in whatever other subject that you want to plug it into um so you know he is talking about things that maybe seem somewhat uh irrelevant if not you know insignificant um but they have full application so we&#x27;re really trying to kind of just think of analog analogies you know how how how would this apply somewhere else you you know what uh what does this have to do with and in in order to be able to do that you really have to kind of survey Larson&#x27;s uh urra so to speak about his his other books and see well let me look at what he says about astronomy how does this plug into his astronomical Theory how does this plug into his metaphysics uh where he&#x27;s talking about philosophy or psychology or how does this plug into his economic system and once you kind of get a broad coverage of the reciprocal system then you can start to see um you know the commonalities between the theory in different areas and so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do on this channel is to give you a broad coverage we&#x27;ve gone through larsson&#x27;s book nothing but motion on Atomic physics we&#x27;ve gone through beyond space and time which is on metaphysics philosophy religion psychology we&#x27;ve gone through we&#x27;re about to go through one of his books on economics called the road to per permanent Prosperity um so we&#x27;re trying to to look at how Larson plugs in those fundamental postulates to every subject but right now we&#x27;re talking about chemistry and heat temperature relations okay compounds of elements about group 1B or having a significant content of such elements follow one or the other of the type one patterns that have been illustrated by examples from the elements the hydrocarbons and other compounds of the lower group elements have specific heat curves of type two uh in which the end point is at a relative temperature of 1 80 as an example of this class we can take e ethylene the thermal factors of these lower group compounds are limited to 111 211 and the combination value one and a half 1 one as we found in volume one however the two groups of atoms which ethylene and similar compounds are composed are inside onetime region unit of distance um which is a concept that is um a little bit opaque to me and also um way out in the weeds but we&#x27;ll just say that uh you use the what he calls the inter Regional ratio uh that&#x27;s how much is lost in the translation when you are looking across a sector or Regional boundary you can&#x27;t see everything that going on on the other side of the boundary and you have to reduce your results by the inter Regional ratio and uh when you do that um you have to then reduce the um measure of the time region they therefore act jointly in thermal interchange rather than acting independently in the matter of two inorganic radicals such as those in um nh4 NO3 each group contri uh contributes to the thermal factors of the molecule and the values applic the value applicable to the molecule as a whole is the sum of the two components ethylene uses one one one and one in 1/2 one one combinations a difference of this kind between the two halves of an organic molecule is quite common and no doubt reflects the lack of symmetry between the positive and negative components that was subject of comment in the discussion of organic structure the combined factors amount to a total of 6 and A2 units this corresponds to a transition point at 58° Kelvin and which agrees with the empirical curve and an end point at 104° Kelvin coincident with the observed melting point Point okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there for today and we&#x27;ll learn some more about temperature relations tomorrow and uh you know just hang in there with this uh it moves slowly but the payback is great because you uh get to grasp a theory of everything that you can apply for the rest of your life to any subject all right thanks for tuning in today and have a</p>
