            <p>Imagine there is a planet out there somewhere a long way off which is very much like the earth just like the earth except that for some reason life never got started. Consider the weather. The weather is supposed to be what&#x27;s called a chaotic process that it depends on little tiny effects. People often talk about a butterfly. Its wings flap this way rather than that way and it makes eventually the other does that rather than this.</p>
<p>On this planet there aren&#x27;t any butterflies. There&#x27;s certainly no human beings, no nothing like that. So that on this planet according to that point of view the weather would be a superp position of all possible weathers a great mess. Now the space probe goes up is is aimed at trying to take a photograph of this mess and propagate it back to earth several light years away. Takes it a long time to get there and then it takes a photograph of the planet.</p>
<p>It comes back and as it gets to the place where it&#x27;s within communication distance from the earth, it sends a signal to the people on the earth and somebody&#x27;s looking at the computer screen and that moment as soon as that person looks at the screen that great mess of all different superp positions suddenly becomes one weather. Makes no sense to me whatsoever. Right? It&#x27;s already decided to be one weather or another way before that happened. There&#x27;s nothing to do with the conscious observer sitting in looking at the screen to decide which way it&#x27;s gone.</p>
