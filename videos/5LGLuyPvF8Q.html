            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse ads founder and chair of the International Society unified science and president trans power corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a theoretical physicist and as a systems and mechanical engineer today&#x27;s screencast as with most miss my screencast will be about the reciprocal system specifically the reciprocal system microcosmic database you can see on the Left panel the main menu from the microcosmos database and on the right panel you can see the main menu for the macrocosmos database i&#x27;ve already covered all the layouts in the macrocosmos database and i&#x27;ve covered many of the layouts already for the micro cosmos database today we&#x27;re going to turn our attention to material and cosmic subatomic particles so I just click here and we had the symbol up here M means material emails electron so this is the material massless uncharged electron the photon frequencies 2r which means 2 times the rid berg frequency the rotational displacement is 1 - 0 - 1 in parentheses which means one magnetic rotational displacement 0 secondary magnetic rotational displacement and one electric displacement space so an electronic an ordinary uncharged electrons is to rotate in this space and so to speak effective rotation displacement 0 0 1 so this material electron the mass is uncharged electron moves outward at the speed of light it doesn&#x27;t have any effect of rotation displacements against the space-time progression the effect of rotational speed is 1/2 - 1 - 2 and then in terms of frequency translating this into this into this into this we finally get our for pi ivan 2r over pi - for our PI okay and by the way the ribbon frequency you can see here is three point two eight eight zero six times 10 to the fifteenth revolutions per second that was spinning very fast honesty now the components of mass in terms of the number of units of all these guys here so I&#x27;m going to just go through this this comes to nothing but motion you can see the derivation fair its pages 157 the win 71 and it&#x27;s also covered in my work existence and interactions the computational treatise of the reciprocal system so one he underscore U is the secondary mass of the electric rotational displacement four seconds one C underscore here is the master - electric charge of electron and positron one piece of U is the primary rotational mass by the way you as opposed to any use based on carbon 12 whereas mu the older you know it&#x27;s based on oxygen 16 know a 1ms of years secondary mass of the magnetic rotational displacement one capital e sub view if secondary math equation was racing for intermediate particles an intermediate particle has two rotational subsistence but only one contributes mass and one capital C sub view is the message the normal electric charge of the proton okay so but these various values that the Maskull tongs we then and see what the material atomic be it will be one easy beautif it has a secondary mass of nitric rotational displacement as 0 C sub you there&#x27;s no electric charge for the massless charges electron piece of you the primary rotational mass of course is here because visually no effective rotational displacement M Sabir secondary mass of the magnetic rotational displacement again that&#x27;s gotta be in the capital e said these are named as electric rotation placing four intermediate particles and that&#x27;s zero as well and then ask you to the normal electric charge of the proton that co2 so the calculated total mass here is this but it&#x27;s potential not actual so keep that in mind it&#x27;s potential alright and that potential just comes from the one let&#x27;s let&#x27;s just look at here we have M - E - this is the material charged electron this is the one we&#x27;re most familiar with this has mass now these units are the same here the displacement effective detective rotational speed and rotation frequency but some of these change this one in particularly this one see severe mass the electric charge about turning positive charge so here this time this this becomes actual because if we combine secondary mass of electric rotational displacement with the nasties electric charge electron positron and this one&#x27;s actually subtracted down so then we get you know the final answer that point zero zero zero five four eight five six seven and then here&#x27;s the okay and then you can see the rest of us there&#x27;s the cosmic electron cosmic electron with a plus charge here&#x27;s the material positrons uncharged mature possum with a plus charge there&#x27;s the c+ time this is their massive size charged positrons in the cosmic sector this is only a potential mass here and you can go through the rest of the material on the Trina this isn&#x27;t a solution mass is purely potential here&#x27;s the cosmic neutrino in its potential here&#x27;s the material masses neutron the cosmic masses neutron material and charged proton and this is actual ordinarily we observe protons seen over the positive charge but you can see here this is actually so this combines to a subview with one piece of u1 MCP and then to get the material charged proton which is reserved to these of you one piece of year one and my capital T rotational base by the way this is circular or elliptical polarized light what&#x27;s your rotation base right there this is has rotational slices 1 0 0 so there&#x27;s a sweet lady cause material rotational babies let&#x27;s say I so keep in mind that most sub atoms are rotating photons some of the intermediate particles like the neutrons are regular maskatron they have two rotations so just keep that in mind I&#x27;m just gonna check on this for something right here like material hydrogen isotope blowing is not really the first atom it&#x27;s actually an intermediate particle and you can see the notation you know so that is a little bit different than what you&#x27;re gonna see for most of the sentence because there are two rotating systems all right that&#x27;s enough for today mister particle physics for you certainly much better than quantum mechanics okay now for the simplest possible treatment of the reciprocal Systems Theory please obtain my work the unmistakable imprint after many decades still getting good reviews on Amazon have all the concepts very little in the way of mathematics it&#x27;s intended as an introduction to the theory but if you do all the mathematics then please obtain my magnum opus existence and interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system a true theory of everything seven or eleven pages in the PDF file seven or eleven slides in the PowerPoint file thousands and thousands of equations tables figures everything you could possibly want you know taking months to go through this work then when you&#x27;re finished with that you can consider getting these two database modules the physical system macrocosmos database covers the universe as a whole galaxy clusters and groups galaxies star clusters stars planets moons minor bodies they may like gas endoscopy voids and you can jump right to picture and videos if that&#x27;s what you won&#x27;t work at it also has a nice graphic package microcosmic state of days today we covered material on cosmic subatomic particles in previous screencasts I&#x27;ve covered solid matter properties including inter atomic distance veil and specific heat energy density thermal expansion compressibility electric or magnetic phenomena isotopes an atomic spectra i&#x27;ve also covered liquid vapor gas matter properties including volume and density specific heat energy entropy viscosity and surface tension and electrical and thermal conductivity and this section here this cosmic elements and subatomic particles cosmic elements and low curvature day material cosmic subatomic particles people do certain properties this also is a nice graph in packages included now my theoretical physics manner dewey be Larsen was also a theoretical economist and I made his work and he can almost also fully conversational that&#x27;s my software program called optimal economists and implementation of our seventeen Cano physics it covers the economics of individuals businesses and business sectors and also the macroeconomics of whole regions and countries completely supersedes Keynesian economics alone you know you might find this work in any other book of the Morrisons were totally supersedes all the other theories and economics especially Kings in economics you know there&#x27;s just so many things wrong with the conventional theories both in physics and economics you need to rethink a lot of your traditions and study carefully what I&#x27;ve done here I&#x27;ve made everything with Larson&#x27;s work fully competition all right well that wraps that accrued day again please study the reciprocal system improved through yourself and thanks for your attention</p>
