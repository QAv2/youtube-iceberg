            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello I was just on news Nation uh I was on there for a short segment when I was asked to going to give a response to an interview with Dave grush there was a one-hour interview and uh he made Dave grush is a guy who you probably heard of if you haven&#x27;t then you should probably go and watch the segments before you listen to this otherwise it will make no sense he is a whistleblower who is making claims that there are alien crafts that the government the US government has recovered and also other governments have recovered and this was like the first release of his big interview where it was going to reveal all the secrets or at least what he could reveal and I was one of the people who was asked on in the show afterwards to give my response and answer a few questions I didn&#x27;t get to speak very much the host Brian uh seemed interested in asking me and he asked me twice like do you think he is lying uh it&#x27;s kind of a gotcha question I think because I maybe is lying maybe he isn&#x27;t maybe he believes what he&#x27;s saying you know maybe it&#x27;s accurate it doesn&#x27;t seem very likely but uh I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily lying he just could well just believe what he&#x27;s saying and be wrong but anyway I only made a couple of points uh on that and so I thought I would since I have my notes in front of me here I thought I would go over my notes and say the things that I would have said had I had more time so the first thing obviously uh with this case is that there isn&#x27;t actually any real evidence yet all we have are the claims of David grush who is making a lot of very extraordinary claims but they&#x27;re all based on either things he says are secret or things he says that somebody told him which apparently are not Secret now the claims are quite extraordinary extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence uh the first claim is that several alien craft have been recovered some of them crashed some of them landed and the occupants left the craft and they were captured by the US government some of these craft had alien bodies in aliens have murdered humans those are pretty significant pretty significant claim I think that really needs some evidence and he said that seems to be the case when it was asked to have aliens murdered humans he said that seems to be the case he see he&#x27;s saying that there is more than one type of alien and that the aliens some of the aliens are malevolent evil aliens he said that some of the craft are very large the size of a football field uh his associate of his who was a lawyer Danny sheenan who&#x27;s part of this whole team has also been talking to some of the eyewitnesses and says that one of the eyewitnesses says that a craft was the size of a football field but only on the inside and uh on the outside it was only 30 feet wide so it&#x27;s kind of like the Tardis in Doctor Who uses Doctor Who physics it&#x27;s bigger on the inside than the outside and I was wondering if this this craft described by Danny Sheehan uh the football spill size craft is the same as the one that Dave garage saw uh One landed in Italy in 1933 and was captured by the United States in 1944 with the help from the Vatican which is pretty interesting apparently the Vatican knows all about this and helps facilitate this UFO being transferred from Italy now this uh uh he also claims that there is a sophisticated disinformation campaign fooling the public and Congress they don&#x27;t even read in the president he says the president is referred to as a temporary employee so they don&#x27;t read in the presidents of these things so this is this massive secret we have these alien craft uh these aliens are murdering people and the American government apparently He suggests have been murdering people also to cover this up he also strongly hinted that there was an agreement between the American government and these aliens some kind of agreement he was kind of cagey about it and he says oh we should look into it but he he pretty much intimated that this was the case and there was some document shown that that he wrote that mentioned this agreement so I think the biggest problem with this other than these claims are outlandish and uh ridiculous and don&#x27;t have any evidence behind them the biggest problem with this is that these claims have been cleared by the government this is something I mentioned on the program but I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning again in the context of what the claims actually are yeah there&#x27;s a government body called doctor the department officer pre-publication and Security review when you want to publish something uh like a TV interview or a book uh and you are covered by classification you you have a security clearance uh even if you&#x27;ve left the government you have to go through dopsa and they have to look at this thing before it&#x27;s published this pre-publication and do a Security review so they&#x27;re going to look at it and they&#x27;ve got to see does this reveal any classified information and so they looked at everything he said they looked at things and he says oh yeah okay so he&#x27;s claiming that the US government is killing people he&#x27;s claiming that aliens are killing people he&#x27;s claiming that there might be a secret agreement with aliens he&#x27;s claiming we have all these alien crafts and we&#x27;ve been reverse engineering it and we&#x27;ve been illegally giving this technology to Industry this is another thing he said we&#x27;ve been illegally giving this technology to Industry and using allowing them to exploit it and then sell it back to the government and make loads of money and this is this is uh uh this is going on uh this is fine yeah this is all fine this is not secret this is not secret doctor that&#x27;s cleared everything that he has said so none of this stuff is secret which kind of begs the question uh why has nobody mentioned this before why has no one mentioned the fact that aliens are killing people why has no one mentioned the fact that the US government has this secret program like selling alien technology to Industry why hasn&#x27;t this actually being revealed why isn&#x27;t it being discussed why hasn&#x27;t anybody raised it in Congress it&#x27;s not Secret it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not classified according to Dave grosh because it&#x27;s all being cleared by doctor uh so the alternative you know to this mystery or the his dots are actually just saying oh go ahead it doesn&#x27;t really matter yes the US government kills people and as a secret uh agreement with uh with murderous aliens yeah that&#x27;s not a secret everybody knows that the alternative to that ridiculous scenario is that what he&#x27;s saying isn&#x27;t actually true now what he&#x27;s saying is yeah and maybe not a lie from his perspective but something he has been told that is false he may well have been told that aliens killed people you may well have been told that aliens are murdering people and that we found alien bodies in crafts and that the American government is covering it up by killing people and is selling technology to Lockheed Martin uh illegally but that&#x27;s all false that&#x27;s the actually the only scenario that makes sense here the only scenario that makes sense because it is all cleared by dropser and you know again this is a point I made on the show not sure it was it wasn&#x27;t immediately followed by Brian didn&#x27;t really understand what I was talking about at first but you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s essentially what&#x27;s going on uh so that was kind of my main point that I wanted to make but there&#x27;s a bunch of other issues like there&#x27;s the cover-up problem the cover-up problem is how do you keep such a thing quiet for 80 years isn&#x27;t it just saying it&#x27;s the American government has some crashed spaceships and we&#x27;ve been covering it up and the vatican&#x27;s helping us he isn&#x27;t just saying that he&#x27;s saying all the major governments all the major Powers throughout the world who have this so at the very least that is Russia and China and there&#x27;s this somehow this is cold war going on where they&#x27;re doing this and we&#x27;re doing it and they&#x27;re doing it is all secret I guess we have some kind of a agreement or understanding where nobody tells you know the that the other country is actually dealing with murderous aliens uh and this seems like a very difficult thing to cover up it would require if you think about what&#x27;s going on here you know you&#x27;ve got you&#x27;ve got government you&#x27;ve got the military you&#x27;ve got Academia you&#x27;ve got uh you&#x27;ve got industry you&#x27;ve got all these people and apparently there are a lot of people in there know about this so if you&#x27;re feeding these this Technologies to to Lockheed Martin and other people then obviously lots of people are going to know about you thousands of people you know over the years like tens of thousands of people it&#x27;s been going on since the 1940s apparently and also in other countries same thing in other countries and not just like you know other stable countries like Britain where we&#x27;ve got like a friendly relationship but countries like Russia which uh used to be the Soviet Union used to be several other countries it used to include Ukraine and uh uh Latvia Lithuania and Estonia and a bunch of other countries Kazakhstan countries like that and he broke up Soviet Union broke up into all these separate countries different people took power you know a whole different kettle of fish you know China after the second world war went through like the cultural revolution completely separate thing separated into China and Taiwan lots of different things going on and yet somehow all these countries that are going through all these regime changes have managed to keep this secret and not let it be revealed and again the excuse they gave is that oh we&#x27;ve kind of made it so it seems silly so someone releases information they&#x27;ll just be laughed at and uh you know that&#x27;s how it hasn&#x27;t got out in the last 70 years it seems uh kind of ridiculous okay then another thing I wanted to bring up was just a simple do the math this is something that kind of glossed over in the interview in the interview uh Ross culthart the interviewer who it really isn&#x27;t like an investigative journalist in this case he&#x27;s really more of an advocate Because he believes strongly that this is happening and he&#x27;s basically trying to make the case but that that aside at aside Ross colfart the interviewer in this case uh so yeah why are they crashing you know why are they crashing and um and and Dave grush said something along the lines you know well you know you know we make cars and things and we make them as well as we can but sometimes sometimes they crash sometimes planes crash and you know even though these aliens are probably more advanced than others they probably still crash sometimes too but you know I think let&#x27;s do the math here let&#x27;s do the math these aliens Yeah the more advanced the most so they&#x27;re probably going to be a lot the craft are probably going to be a lot safer than ours you think they&#x27;d have these automated systems it&#x27;s like you know like a Tesla now will stop if you try to run into somebody it used to be you used to be able to run people over now now they stop automatically uh they probably have much more advanced versions of that you know I think probably at least 100 years more advanced than what we have maybe 10 000 years maybe in a million years more advanced so they&#x27;ve got safer craft think about how many accidents how many serious plane crashes we have we usually only have like one one a year or something like that in the United States you think about the last big plane crash that happened in the United States I can&#x27;t even remember it I think it was a few years ago so you know planes crash every year or so we&#x27;re also told that UFOs crash every every year or so every few years maybe like every five years something like that because they&#x27;re a bit safer aren&#x27;t they but consider how many planes there are in the sky at any one time there is like thirty thousand commercial flights every day these are the the proper commercial flights you know New York to Boston type thing it&#x27;s like real commercial flights you know just going across the country big planes thirty thousand of them there&#x27;s actually more like 45 000 if you count all the small planes as well the general aviation planes every day and yeah we only have about one crash every year every few years and we have a similar number of crashes of UFOs which are probably much safer which means there&#x27;s probably more UFOs many more UFOs in the sky than there are planes if you take this simple math and extrapolate it if there&#x27;s 30 000 like significant planes in the sky that probably means there&#x27;s hundreds of thousands of UFOs in the sky every day for them to crash at this rate unless they&#x27;ve got like a failure percentage of like you know one percent or something they&#x27;re just constantly dropping out of the sky for some bizarre reason they would have to be hundreds of thousands uh even Dave gresh says like they&#x27;re going to be like our cars they crash sometimes you know the like the planes they crash sometimes but if if they are like our planes there would have to be hundreds of thousands of them in the sky norat doesn&#x27;t see them the FAA doesn&#x27;t see them other Pilots they see loads of the planes all the time they don&#x27;t see these hundreds of thousands of UFOs people don&#x27;t take photographs of them I I see planes all the time when I&#x27;m walking my dog I should probably see like 10 20 planes on a typical like walk of half an hour I can take I take photos of them all the time if there&#x27;s even more UFOs than that why don&#x27;t I see them some of them are supposedly big the size of a football field don&#x27;t see those Arrow the NASA&#x27;s uh Narrows the pentagons official body that&#x27;s searching for these these things they don&#x27;t see hundreds of thousands of UFOs every day what do I already see they&#x27;ve seen a few balloons a few silver spheres that are floating through the air they&#x27;ve seen a few optical illusions you know most of what they see isn&#x27;t actually even a real UFO it&#x27;s stuff like a distant plane they showed one of the NASA Herring which is just three dots in the distance and the camera was moving around making it look weird this uh Middle East sphere that they they showed on this the show I was just on it&#x27;s just probably just a balloon yeah it&#x27;s Parallax effect just a very common thing it&#x27;s green triangles uh they&#x27;re not even UFOs at all so this they&#x27;re not seeing any UFOs and yet if they&#x27;re crashing one every year or so there would have to be hundreds of thousands of them in the sky so perhaps they just don&#x27;t exist perhaps it&#x27;s not actually true so I guess a few other points uh yeah I&#x27;m a skeptic I was brought on for being this skeptic Viewpoint and Skeptics I think would like this cleared up I would like the government to investigate please Congress if you are listening please investigate I call upon Congress to investigate this thing you know people are always saying Mick why didn&#x27;t you call upon Congress to investigate this it&#x27;s kind of silly like it&#x27;s not like you know you can&#x27;t simply call upon Congress to investigate but yeah that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing I I agree with the calls on Congress to investigate not trying to stop it at all just pointing out how ridiculous the claims are we need to look into the situation as a whole you know why do we have this situation why do we have people who claim to work in the program which is what they call it apparently the program and uh what&#x27;s actually going on what are things going on I think it&#x27;s probably the program is a crash retrieval and reverse engineering program and I think what they are retrieving is crashed foreign craft like Russian fighter jets Russian drones Chinese fighter jets Chinese submarines Russian submarines you know we won I think it was like 1976 we spent three billion dollars in today&#x27;s money recovering a Russian submarine top secret program and uh we would have taken that submarine and reverse engineered the heck out of it and it would have been super secret and the people working on that program might not have known what they were working on because they&#x27;d be just like hey here&#x27;s a bit of metal like you know check it out and then someone else would synthesize that data into the the greater understanding of what was going on but not everybody who works in the program is going to be read into every single thing that&#x27;s going on because you want to keep it secret which may well be why we&#x27;ve arrived at this situation there&#x27;s a secret program of Crash retrievals and reverse engineering that the UAP task force wasn&#x27;t allowed to look into because it&#x27;s super secret and or the UAP task force need to know about Russian submarines and Chinese Jets so we got this um misunderstanding and everybody&#x27;s like hmm must be UFOs and then people working on the program were like yeah I got this really weird bit of metal I got this strange isotope ratios no idea what it is I think it&#x27;s UFOs and someone else is like yeah did you hear about malstrom no no uh mulstrom yeah the UFO shot down some shut down some nuclear weapons like back in the um was it 60s 50s long time ago and then I think this UFO mythology kind of kind of gets into this whole situation and these people start talking and some people become convinced and then they start reading stuff they start folding in other bits of Mythology like some people who&#x27;ve worked in government and also outside of government kind of pulled in things that they did like analyzing bits of metal there&#x27;s this famous bit of metal but that uh has these multiple layers Linda Moulton Howe had it I believe she got it from Art Bell and then sold it to Tom Delong and then Tom Delong sold it to his own company but it&#x27;s just a multi-layered bit of magnesium and bismuth which people are like what is this thing it&#x27;s probably just a bit of an industrial process byproduct or something that somebody sent in on a lark to Art Bell like 30 years ago but that seems to be what seems to be what Dave grush is talking about this meta material and I very much suspect that&#x27;s actually what he&#x27;s talking about anyway I&#x27;m kind of getting a little bit off topic here but also talking about yeah we want an investigation and we want to figure out what&#x27;s going on because uh if if it&#x27;s just like a bunch of people you know there&#x27;s a real secret program but a bunch of people think this secret program is actually an alien crash retrieval program it&#x27;s kind of messed up yeah it&#x27;s kind of like there&#x27;s um a systemic and cultural failure within the intelligence community due in part to excessive secrecy because no one&#x27;s allowed to talk about anything and this this this failure this systemic flight failure the failure of the system is allowing false beliefs and magical thinking to grow so people end up thinking that they&#x27;re there&#x27;s a they&#x27;re working on a crash retrieval program of of alien UFOs when they&#x27;re actually not and then all these stories kind of grow in the telling okay so yeah the UFO mythology is uh contains things that Dave gross talked about UFO mythology talks about this this uh well Roswell obviously he just basically gave the standard uh believer version of Roswell the malstrom instrument incident with the nuclear weapons going offline uh that&#x27;s something that that happened and there&#x27;s a report of one security guard seeing a glowing red ore but some points in a different location you can read more about it on metabung just look for malstrom there&#x27;s a whole bunch of Investigations into that but there&#x27;s really not a lot to it uh mussolinas UFO in 1922 33 and recovered by the US with the help of the Vatican that&#x27;s kind of a new thing but basically it&#x27;s UFO mythology Doctor Who physics uh this isn&#x27;t something that Dave gresh said but you know the lawyer he&#x27;s working with uh sheenan like said that one of the craft was bigger on the inside than the outside this is typical UFO mythology people have given similar accounts and he&#x27;s kind of I think he&#x27;s and perhaps other people are folding in other accounts of UFO mythology into something of a real situation or before I forget another thing Dave gross said was that the head of Arrow yeah everyone&#x27;s saying that Arrow this this Pentagon task force which is looking into UFOs cannot um look into these programs because it doesn&#x27;t have title 50 clearance however Dave garush says he talked to Sean Kirkpatrick and the Sean Kirkpatrick could have looked into this and could have discovered the same things that Dave garage said now Ross colfart will tell you this is not true because he doesn&#x27;t have title 50 clearance but the guy who does have title 50 clearance Dave garush just told us just told us in an interview with Ross that um Sean Kirkpatrick could look into it and could discover the same things maybe Shankar battery looked into it and discovered nothing maybe Sean Kirkpatrick as is implied in the interview is part of a giant cover-up I tend to think the former um the first one Dave Kirkpatrick looked into it didn&#x27;t find anything to substantiate it Arrow has said the total lots of whistleblowers who have told him this is secret program and they&#x27;ve not been able to find any evidence to substantiate it and I think that&#x27;s just what&#x27;s going on some broader issues here actually I mean there&#x27;s some more specific issues here first I made some notes during this year Maelstrom Dimensions oh yes so he was going to speculating a lot about extra dimensions and this is how the craft traveled from one location to the other which sounded very science fictionary to me you know he said it&#x27;s he has a degree in physics um I mean a degree in physics it&#x27;s great it&#x27;s great it&#x27;s not like a PhD in physics and I don&#x27;t know how much physics he&#x27;s actually done over the years but he seems convinced that there&#x27;s this particular mechanism where uh extra Dimensions as defined by quantum physics can be used for Rapid travel or perhaps the creatures themselves are coming from another dimension like you know this kind of parallel universes perhaps a different spatial level above you know to the side or you know diagonal because it&#x27;s an extra Dimension uh and the the creatures are inter-dimensional beings you didn&#x27;t want to necessarily say you know they&#x27;re aliens from another planet that&#x27;s a little bit silly they could be being some another dimension or they could have be being from another planet that traveled here via or another dimension or via folding the dimensions in a strange way it seemed basically like he was repeating a bunch of Science Fiction uh there was a short segment on the videos which you know obviously like if you look at my my channel I do a lot of work analyzing these UFO videos he mentioned a couple of them not a lot didn&#x27;t discuss very much details they brought up gimbal one of my favorite videos and uh he was asked you know uh Ross say something oh there&#x27;s a whole Bevy of debunkers on the internet who&#x27;ve said things about this well it&#x27;s mostly me it&#x27;s mostly me who&#x27;s been saying things about the gimbal video I&#x27;ve done this very detailed analysis and you can you can check them out so he said oh yeah I&#x27;ve looked at that with people who know about the app player and because of like you know stuff like the the pixel saturation uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not a plane yeah we don&#x27;t know what it is but you know uh it&#x27;s not a plain pixel saturation didn&#x27;t really say very much but what he did say about pixel saturation reminded me of a person he would know on the UAP task force called Travis Taylor now Travis Taylor is a guy with two phds one in Optics and the other one I think I believe in Aerospace Systems mechanics or something of Aerospace science but clever guy got two phds he was the chief scientist of the UAP task force he&#x27;s also a TV scientist he appears on Ancient Aliens where he&#x27;s constantly going on with great excitement about how some hieroglyphoses on a wall is actually evidence that aliens are visitors in the past he&#x27;s also a TV scientist on the show uh the secrets of Skinwalker Ranch where he plays again another very excitable scientist I mean it&#x27;s not I say plays I mean it&#x27;s supposed to be real it&#x27;s supposed to be actually him he appears as a very excitable scientist who makes these ridiculous errors of Science and these ridiculous leaps of uh of inference in things and says things like uh well that rocket went up and then it could avert a bit to the left maybe there&#x27;s a portal above the ranch I mean this is pretty much verbatim the type of thing he says so yeah it&#x27;s just entertainment but he and the he&#x27;s basically he&#x27;s claiming that this is actual science he&#x27;s claiming they&#x27;re doing real science obviously they are not but uh this is what he claims and the science he has done has been very poor he presented a paper once well not a paper like a presentation at a UFO conference where he was showing the gimbal video the gimbal video and he pointed out that he had these little wibbly lines on it and so he said like these wibbly lines are interference fringes because there was like some moment where the camera got bumped and then the light Pathways went through two things at the same time and they interfered with each other and we can use this interference of two different frames to figure out how far away this object is so we did all this math using these the sine waves that they determined were in this image and came up with answer problem was this wibbling on the line wasn&#x27;t actually something to do with the internal Optics of the system which his PhD might have been able to address it was uh interlacing the cameras that uh the recorded this video use interlaced video which means that every other line on the video is recorded one frame off from another so when something moves rapidly which is the camera was moving in this instance things end up looking jaggy like this so what he was seeing wasn&#x27;t an interference pattern it was just two frames of the image and the the Jaggers of of the interlacing and he wasn&#x27;t looking at the original video he was looking at a version of the video he downloaded from YouTube and the smooth sine wave was because he was a blurred out low resolution version of the video and is smoothed it out anyway basically it was his entire analysis was complete nonsense and it&#x27;s typical of the type of mistakes that he makes but everyone respects him because he&#x27;s two phds and so they don&#x27;t question him which I think is perhaps speaking to the the systemic and cultural failure that I was discussing earlier you know people don&#x27;t question each other and there&#x27;s a lot of secrecy so you can&#x27;t ask certain questions so you&#x27;ve got this combination of things excessive deference to people who you think know the right answer and uh secrecy and so people end up believing things but you kind of back to the analysis so Dave garush says saturation pixel saturation that is analysis that Travis Taylor did and Travis Taylor did this analysis and said that these pixels are too saturated for the distance and that means that it couldn&#x27;t actually be a plane so this is his this is Theory but problem is he&#x27;s basing this uh saturation issue on again low resolution video that has a low color depth the actual original video is in 14 bits yeah technical thing but 14 bets is a lot more than 8 Bits which is what you get when you look at the video that&#x27;s on YouTube so again here&#x27;s analysis was kind of garbage in garbage out and I do not think that Travis Taylor&#x27;s assessment is correct it&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a long thread of it on it on metabunk explaining all the math and the science and if Dave garage is basing his assessment on Travis Taylor his buddy from the UAP task force then I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s correct either uh but if he wants to talk about it if he wants to you know debate it or something he&#x27;s now a public citizen he&#x27;s free to uh to like publish his own analysis of the public video gimbal so why don&#x27;t you go ahead Dave grosh publish this this thing except you probably didn&#x27;t do the analysis did you you just repeated Travis Taylor&#x27;s analysis which was wrong all right so uh more broader issues I should just finish off this oh the Omaha sphere Omaha sphere another video that they brought up and down didn&#x27;t really say very much about it I think Ross says well it&#x27;s either shooting away into the distance or it&#x27;s going into the ocean and I think I can&#x27;t already say something like he&#x27;s going into the ocean but you Analyze That video it&#x27;s not too complicated you zoom in look at the very end of it where it disappears what happens is the the object doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s actually going into the water it looks like it&#x27;s going behind the Horizon let me just grab a flashlight demonstrate uh here is a flashlight pointing at the camera now if something goes behind the her the Horizon you&#x27;ll see it kind of like you know you&#x27;ll see half of it and then you&#x27;ll see none of it it&#x27;ll disappear behind the Horizon now if a bright light if something goes into the water sorry same thing same thing if a bright light goes down and it goes if it goes into the water it&#x27;s just going to Blink out it&#x27;s going to disappear if it goes behind the Horizon what happens is it just gets smaller and shrinks and disappears this is what we see in the Omaha sphere video we see a light that is shrinking and disappearing we know it&#x27;s an infrared which means it&#x27;s a heat source that is shrinking and disappearing something going into the water wouldn&#x27;t do that this is something that is going behind the Horizon it&#x27;s being gradually obscured by The Horizon and don&#x27;t know what it is but it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s going into the water so again that analysis is wrong okay those are my little points that I had that I wrote down so just some broader points uh uh this story is coming from The Usual Suspects the story it was originally written by Leslie Kane and Ralph Blumenthal they wanted to publish it in New York Times New York Times turned them down they wanted to publish in the Washington Post The Washington Post wanted to fact check it and they were taking too long fact checking it now Dave grush&#x27;s name was unfortunately leaked onto the internet uh right about a month ago by by the lawyer on the team uh Danny Sheehan who you know blurted it out he has a kind of a no filter approach to talking Dennis Sheehan and so they that his name was being brought up and so they wanted to move it forward Washington Post didn&#x27;t have enough time to publish it uh to fact check it before they published it so it&#x27;s published in the debrief which is this much smaller site that&#x27;s very kind of UFO friendly they do a lot of UFO stories and uh and they published it probably did some fact checking but I mean we know that his credentials are good but how much fat chicken can you do in that short amount of time so Leslie keen and Rob bloomathon they wrote the original New York Times story Leslie key and rock Blumenthal are also a big kind of uh UFO people they&#x27;ve uh Leslie Keen has written a lot about UFO she&#x27;s also written books about uh life after death in the afterlife Rob Blumenthal has written books about alien abduction he wrote a biography of John Mack called The Believer uh which is about how John Mack thinks he has all this evidence of alien abductions by interviewing a lot of people and believing them all they&#x27;re up Blumenthal and Leslie Keane um I think I can have the more credulous journalists but they are also fairly careful journalists to a degree to a degree in that they don&#x27;t want to alienate people and this is something that uh kind of a poor choice of Worcester alienate they don&#x27;t want to turn people off by having the story seem too silly and Leslie Keane Levy Kane sorry Leslie Kane uh has said explicitly in a number of times that there were things in the they didn&#x27;t report in the New York Times story uh because they were too too extreme she said of this story that she didn&#x27;t talk about the bodies with uh with Dave garage you seemed quite surprised that this eve this even came up that there were bodies and so uh when when you know she heard about it she was says like oh I never talked to him about that I don&#x27;t want to talk about that and I wouldn&#x27;t have put it in the story had I had talked about it so she&#x27;s like yeah retrieved alien crap that&#x27;s one thing but retrieved alien bodies that&#x27;s a step too far that&#x27;ll just make it seem silly and of course there&#x27;s far sillier things that have come out since then and I&#x27;d be very interesting to hear Leslie Kane&#x27;s uh opinion on aliens have murdered people what do you think of that Leslie or uh the America has murdered people to cover up the fact that aliens are exist and have been murdering people and this is these massive cover-ups uh some some crafts are bigger on the inside than the outside like the Tardis um you know things like and there&#x27;s this massive campaign of of cover-ups so you know the the train to make it palatable but obviously it&#x27;s gone beyond that and other people who are reporting on this seem similarly cautious they&#x27;re now like oh well I&#x27;m not saying that he&#x27;s right I&#x27;m saying he&#x27;s a very credible person like Bryce Seibel uh zabel uh was saying that he and he was the one who kind of said first that uh aliens had killed people or there was a malevolent aliens that&#x27;s a thing there&#x27;s apparently two different races of aliens one of which is malevolent which is uh very interesting uh so other people I and this Ross Colt yeah he&#x27;s kind of appreciate is the investigative journalist who&#x27;s worked on 60 Minutes yeah but you know mostly what he does now is he does stories about UFOs and he spent months preparing for this particular story because this is the big story this is the big story and he knows it&#x27;s a big story so this is pretty much all he&#x27;s done he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s been preparing for this story when he&#x27;s interviewing um Dave garage he&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s a hard-hitting journalist I mean sure he says like are you crazy Dave gresh have you been diagnosed with mental illness which is you know stupid question really you need to be a bit more subtle than that because obviously the answer to that is no anyway so uh Ross Colfer UFO journalist basically pushing the UFO narrative Gary Nolan apparently is behind the scenes I&#x27;ve heard that Gary Nolan is behind the scenes uh helping with this and he&#x27;s been one of the people who&#x27;s been introducing uh Ross Dave gross to other people so and and he&#x27;s you know one of the the fixtures in the UFO circuit nowadays he was on um what&#x27;s his name Tucker Carlson and various other shows he&#x27;s been on is is he was at the uh the uh the Ancient Aliens conference alien Con in Pasadena I saw him there shook his hand seems like a nice guy alien believer he has some kind of alien experience maybe not aliens maybe just some kind of altered reality experience as a child like aliens in his room uh UFO flying over but he&#x27;s a guy who&#x27;s basically already decided like 10 years ago that the alien narrative is correct and has been trying to uh promote it in what we call the invisible College which is this this group of people acting in Academia and in in the military in the intelligence Community to promote uh disclosure of UFOs because they believe that UFOs are are aliens uh other people you&#x27;ve probably heard of Lou Elizondo yeah he was somebody who was brought forward by Leslie Kane and Rob Blumenthal during the the first story back in 2017 uh he is involved by all accounts behind the scenes in this this current story I&#x27;m sure he won&#x27;t deny it if you ask him it Eric Davis is uh someone who&#x27;s been around for a long time May well be one of the sources he&#x27;s he&#x27;s like a a physicist and he works I don&#x27;t know where he works actually I have to I have to verify that but you know he&#x27;s he&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s told similar stories and apparently his briefed Congress or you know brief someone who briefed Congress and said we have technology of off-world origin this was a story a while back no one really took it up because like who is Eric Davis uh but now we&#x27;ve got yeah the big dogs we&#x27;ve got Dave Garrosh who has this title 50 clearance who&#x27;s much better than Eric Davis but basically is telling the same story I mean Eric Davis I&#x27;m sure has been advising Hal putoff really old one don&#x27;t mean it in a bad way but uh old school in that goes back a long way into the history of ufology he did some of the original uh project Stargate research for the government when the government was believing in in the Supernatural and they thought they could do remote viewing project Stargate they they looked into like you know can we spy on the Russians uh and uh with using using psychic powers and can we kill goats by staring at them it&#x27;s a movie Made Men Who Stare at Goats based on a true story Hal putoff was there how putoff has been uh involved over the years on this and he&#x27;s involved now he&#x27;s probably one of the people that Dave Garcia talks to again ask him I doubt he will deny it so these are all names that have been in ufology for many years and so for many decades and it seems to me that they are promoting their own beliefs rather than genuinely reporting and investigating on a case they want to promote UFO disclosure because they already believe it to be true so they believe Dave garisha&#x27;s story which is part of that whole overall systemic and cultural failure where people just believe other people because it fits their system and there&#x27;s no checks and balances and no one&#x27;s encouraged to actually check it and then everything&#x27;s wrapped in secrecy so we can&#x27;t actually figure it out then finally you can see why I couldn&#x27;t fit all this in into the five minutes or less that I actually got to speak probably even less than that he was more like two minutes uh I couldn&#x27;t fit all this in because there&#x27;s so much but my last my last point is about the Paranormal and Gary Nolan said a couple of months ago uh we don&#x27;t want to talk about the woo woo is a term used to mean paranormal it&#x27;s actually was originally used by the skeptical Community but it&#x27;s kind of been co-opted a little bit by the uh the UFO and the Paranormal community and they refer to Paranormal as the woo as in woo scary ghost but yeah seriously uh Gary Nolan says like we don&#x27;t want to talk about the woo because it scares the bejesus out of people no one wants to know that you know they&#x27;re actually ghosts and uh and malevolent alien entities that the government has uh are packed with at the expense of U.S lives no one wants to know that that type of real scary stuff they don&#x27;t want to know that aliens are you know reading our minds and that they&#x27;re appearing in our rooms and that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re attaching themselves to our bodies and hitchhiking back from Skinwalker Ranch which is something that&#x27;s apparently Travis Taylor believes uh you know he&#x27;s saying people are scared of that so let&#x27;s not mention it let&#x27;s not mention it let&#x27;s not mention the world this is something yeah that Leslie Kane will agree with she says I&#x27;m not going to talk about the Paranormal even though I know that it&#x27;s there Leslie Kane famously has been to seances and uh has been touched by disembodied hands and those Sciences seems to give a lot of credence to the the reality of of mediums summoning something from the other side the woo as Gary Nolan said Gary Nolan said we don&#x27;t want to talk about the woo but we all know the Woo is just around the corner that&#x27;s what he said and kind of how he said it and interestingly when he said it he was there with uh a medium Tyler Henry famous TV medium the medium to the Stars Tyler Henry very nice young man who speaks to the dead and tells people what the dead tell him about their stories the Woo is just around the corner in ufology most people who are into ufology are not very far away from believing in the Paranormal and a lot of them believe in the Paranormal Gary Netherland I think believes that there is something to Tyler Henry&#x27;s claims of being able to speak to the Dead uh or at least do something some kind of channeling and I think he believes uh kind of what his mentor uh Jacques valet believes that a lot of this alien presence UFOs isn&#x27;t actually nuts and bolts aliens from another world traveling here on spaceships it&#x27;s actually some kind of inter-dimensional being perhaps like a trickster type person who&#x27;s faking these UFO incidents as UFOs so that they can disguise what they&#x27;re actually doing it&#x27;s a bit vague on the details but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s something like that so the Woo is all around you know all these people kind of believe to some degree or another in the Supernatural and this is something that is being being hidden and I think though it kind of came a little bit to the surface with uh with Dave garesh&#x27;s talks of things like malevolence aliens malevolent entities that&#x27;s the type of thing that you talk about you know weird entities like doing evil things to you uh but yeah it&#x27;s um it&#x27;s kind of troubling the this these beliefs actually exist within some people in the intelligence community and apparently more than more than one like several people believe something along those lines probably to different degrees some of them simply believe that there&#x27;s a crash retrieval program not everyone&#x27;s going to be like down with the aliens are killing people Theory not everyone&#x27;s going to be down with his theories of extra Dimensions or even the malevolence of certain things but there are people who believe that there&#x27;s an alien crash retrieval program would be great if it was true I mean I really like to to uh hear about these aliens you know I&#x27;m very much a science fan of the science fiction fan and I&#x27;d love to hear about aliens it would be really really interesting I wouldn&#x27;t care if I was wrong about certain UFOs that turn out to be actually aliens of course most of the things I identified have been definitively identified as things like planes so it wouldn&#x27;t really change that but it would be amazing if we could actually solve certain cases as being aliens and then there&#x27;s the whole thing about aliens themselves and all the new science that&#x27;s going to come around be pretty amazing probably pretty disruptive as well but you know it would be really an interesting time to live in and you know if they&#x27;ve been here for a while so they haven&#x27;t uh haven&#x27;t disrupted us yet but it would be super interesting I&#x27;m not against him I think uh Congress should investigate not because I think there are aliens but because uh this is kind of messed up this situation that we have now these claims that are being made and these back and forth things and congressmen being a congress people being involved and hearings being held it&#x27;s kind of messed up dig deep figure out what&#x27;s going on and uh let&#x27;s bring everything out into the sunlight as much as possible and try to clear it up you know unfortunately though I think what we&#x27;re looking at probably is a classified program called the program which does stuff like crash retrievals and has recovered Russian submarines and uh uh Soviet Satellites uh back in the 70s it was a joint program between Canada and the United States which which you know they recovered bits of that satellite and took it to be analyzed it&#x27;s probably some people who work on those programs who think that it was a a UFO because they didn&#x27;t know exactly what they were working on so we may not actually discover the truth hopefully Congress will and hopefully Congress will be able to tell us you know what the situation is in terms of you know this being not aliens uh but people are not going to believe them people are going to say it&#x27;s a cover-up and the cycle will just continue anyway those are the points that took me let me see how long uh 45 minutes to actually go over in in great detail and uh I just had a few minutes on the show and so I didn&#x27;t really have the time to do it um love to talk more about it anybody wants to delve into these details and any more depth anything that I&#x27;ve missed and there probably is stuff the stuff that came up during the interviews anything I&#x27;ve missed uh I&#x27;d love to talk more about it it&#x27;s a fascinating topic and it&#x27;s not going away anyway that is my 46 minutes so signing off</p>
