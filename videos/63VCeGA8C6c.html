            <p>Humanity deliberately banned these five revolutionary inventions, choosing to erase a future of free energy and miracle cures simply because they were too powerful to control. In the 1980s, amateur chemist Maurice Ward created a plastic called Starlite. This super material could reportedly withstand temperatures of 10,000° C and the force of a nuclear blast. Ward kept the formula a closely guarded secret, and after his death in 2011, the recipe for this worldchanging substance was lost forever. Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich invented the Cloudbuster in the 1950s, a device he claimed could manipulate atmospheric energy to induce rain.</p>
<p>He believed he was tapping into a universal life force called Orone, but the US Food and Drug Administration saw it as fraud. The FDA obtained an injunction that led to Reich&#x27;s books being burned and him dying in prison. Inventor Stanley Meyer claimed his water fuel cell could split water into hydrogen and oxygen using less energy than conventional electrolysis. He demonstrated a dune buddy that he said ran on just water from a local creek. After his sudden death in 1998, which some call suspicious, an Ohio court ruled his invention was fraudulent and the patents expired without renewal.</p>
<p>Red mercury is a mysterious substance rumored during the Cold War to be a key component in creating miniature high yield nuclear weapons. Its very existence has been a subject of intense debate and intelligence operations for decades. Whether real or a hoax, the concept was so dangerous that global agencies worked to suppress its myth to prevent nuclear proliferation on the black market. Nicola Tesla&#x27;s Warden Cliff Tower was designed to provide free wireless electricity to the entire globe. The project was funded by JP Morgan, who pulled his investment once he realized there was no way to put a meter on free energy.</p>
<p>This single decision halted a future where power could have been a universal right, not a commodity. These inventions walked the line between genius and global threat.</p>
