            <p>around like a ball or a top or something it&#x27;s a much more complicated concept but if I sort of think of it as spin it&#x27;s sort of like the spin spins 360° over in the complex plane then spins 360° in three space real space well while it&#x27;s over spinning in the 360 over in the time domain it can absorb energy coming in in the fourth axis because the charge is looking over there and it&#x27;s open to the receipt of energy from that domain then when it starts to to rotate so to speak in in three dimensions over in real space it&#x27;s already excited by this time energy the energy it received in the time domain so it is decaying now it is putting out the emitting the energy it absorbs in the time domain emits in the three space in fact it emits longitudinal waves now I can find very powerful support for that in two other areas one is particle physics and one is quantum field theory in Quantum field theory for example mandal and Shaw in their standard textbook Quantum field Theory Wy 1984 chapter 5 they very strongly look at a very similar problem they look at the longitudinal Photon and the scalar Photon which is a Time polarized Photon the energy over there oscillating on the time axis okay so what we have is we have a very strong argument that neither the scalar Photon that is the time polarized Photon nor nor the longitudinal Photon which is over in three space are individually observable but if you somehow can combine the two they are observable as the instantaneous Quantum potential nice because if I go back to uh Whitaker 1903 is decomposition of the scal of potential in the bidirectional longitud and waves Whitaker made an error in his u in his U interpretation it&#x27;s a standard area made throughout most of U1 electrodynamics they interpret the wave after it&#x27;s interacted with the charge in other words what&#x27;s diverted from The Wave by the charge they don&#x27;t ever specify the wave in space or the proton in space or the energy in space they always do the thing after it interacts now if you go back before it interacts you had to have something causing this interaction that&#x27;s in the fourth space because you get three space after you have observation you have a partial with respect to T to tear off the time and leave your Frozen snapshot and that&#x27;s what you see the effect anyway they argue very powerfully that this combination of these two give you the instantaneous uh Quantum potential and if I reinterpret Whitaker&#x27;s decomposition to straighten out the fact that he had two effects rather than a cause and effect his input phase conjugate wave actually is a Time polarized wave which means it now agrees with the same thing from Quantum field Theory from excuse me particle physics uh and and Quantum field Theory now in particle physics we have the fact that with the award of the no prize any dipole is known to have uh to be a broken symmetry in the active exchange with the vacuum the very definition of broken symmetry means that some conservation law there in that exchange area has been violated that&#x27;s what broken symmetry means so what it means is if I have energy coming in in the time domain it means that it&#x27;s not flowing back out in the time domain and it&#x27;s flowing out in the uh space three space domain and that is exactly what&#x27;s happening over and the other ways of looking at it so we have an agreement between Quantum field Theory between my interpretation of uh reinterpretation I should say reinterpretation of Whitaker&#x27;s profound decomposition of the scalar potential in 1903 and uh Quantum field Theory we have an agreement between three major things that&#x27;s pretty solid so we can State now that all em energy in three space first enters there on these Source charges it first enters there from the time domain basically any three space em energy we&#x27;re looking at we have converted a little time into that now how powerful is time energy let me give you a little experiment to think of in your head little thought experiment suppose uh that I have a I have some spatial energy electromagnetic energy in space and suppose I reach in here and I compress this by the factor c² I&#x27;m in three dimensions now I&#x27;ve compressed this down to a very dense energy in three dimensions what can I do with this well I can leave it right where it is in which case it&#x27;s known as mass f e equal MC squ standard thing familiar to everybody no big problem everybody can get their mind a hold of that but I don&#x27;t have to leave it in three dimensions if I pick this thing up and I put it over in the time domain what I&#x27;ve really done is changeed the photon oscillations from U from uh uh lateral in three space to lateral over there along the time axis so I have a longitudinal wave in a Time domain and it becomes what we call time so time itself is pure energy and it in fact has the same energy density as mass it&#x27;s very powerful energy if you want to deal with powerful energy in the photon you don&#x27;t deal with a spatial energy component Delta e you deal with delta T
