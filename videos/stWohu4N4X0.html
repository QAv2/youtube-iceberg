            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we uh take deep dives into great theories of everything all-encompassing theories cosmologies and um you know try to delve into how to best use them uh in your own life to shift your Paradigm to uh awaken to 5D Consciousness and to form a holistic world viiew today is our 519th video that we&#x27;ve done on Dey be Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and the reciprocal system also known as Universe of motion is um a theory of everything that started working on back in about 1930 when he had some epiphanies uh working as a chemical engineer out in Portland and uh he took many many years to develop his ideas in in an inductive manner um and then uh around 1959 he proposed his two fundamental postulates about how he believed the universe operated and from there through a process of deduction he uh derived a theoretical Universe what LaRon what larsson&#x27;s Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then uh he Compares his theoretical Universe with the measured empirical Universe of modern science that they have compiled in many of their scientific tables he does that here in this study called basic properties of matter that we&#x27;re reading from today uh we are on chapter 26 which is called Adam building now LaRon uh does most of the work in his first postulate the universe is composed entirely of one component motion not matter not energy not force or anything else but motion and in particular what he calls scalar motion so motion with a magnitude but no specific direction that you can model using a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up the balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other if you suck in the balloon all the dots will be moving toward each other they won&#x27;t be moving in any specific Direction each dot will be moving toward or away from each other dot so every dot will be moving in every direction no specific directions this is a scalar motion the outward motion Larson calls the progression the inward motion he refers to as gravitation and the progression is really the source of everything but in order for it to manifest it has to be reversed uh and turned into gravitation and um uh so Larsson says that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time okay so the universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time you can see that in something uh Elementary motion called speed speed is uh you know the bicycle is moving at 10 miles per hour 10 miles of space in 1 hour of time that is speed space over time uh but Larson applies that to all of our scientific uh phenomena and like matter like energy like force like acceleration pressure electric charge electric current these are all forms of motion and they all can be described um exclusively in space time terms with as fractions with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator um with exponents so for example matter is time to the third power over space to the third power uh and so on and so forth and uh if you&#x27;d like a um more thorough rundown of how the postulates work and how he plugs them in and derives a theoretical Universe from them uh you probably want to take a look at one of my for first 474 videos on the subject um where I go into it in a little bit of detail uh even more detail you can get from watching my 15 videos on the outline of the deductive development of the reciprocal system which is a paper that Larson gave many years ago um Larsson died back in 1990 um leaving behind a great Theory but uh incomplete and with a few rough edges and mistakes and uh so it&#x27;s been a struggle to kind of uh keep it afloat um a lot of great work was done by DRS kbk Neu and Dr Bruce pet um in order to uh kind of re-evaluate and uh reformulate some of the uh difficulties that Larson had and extending it into other areas but uh still progress is slow um and so that hopefully where I come in to um you know uh revive some interest in the reciprocal system and get some people um working on it because I believe that ultimately when we get to the 22nd 23rd I don&#x27;t know Century uh this will be the uh foundation for all learning um but um it hasn&#x27;t been fleshed out enough for people to figure that out yet but I think you can get a good idea uh by looking at some of his uh his work here uh because he is able to formulate a theoretical universe that um mirrors the empirical universe of the modern scientists so he&#x27;s able to recreate in many cases their scientific tables just from Theory so you got to figure that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s on to something um even though as he admitted you know whether he applies his theory correctly in every situation um you know is a is a different matter as uh whether the theory itself is correct okay well we are in the middle of chapter um 26 on Adam building and uh let&#x27;s get started right here um uh okay atom building in Intergalactic space is slow because of the low density of matter but the amount of time spent in the stage is so long that there is sufficient opportunity for production of a finite quantity of all of the 117 possible elements in proportions determined by the relative probability after this initial period the existing matter is increasingly concentrated into large Aggregates this speeds up the atom building but meanwhile there are processes in operation that destroy some of the heavier elements a significant aspect of the theoretical findings reported in this and the immediately preceding chapters is the important role of the massless particles and entities which with the exception of the photon and the neutrino are not recognized by conventional science as brought out in the discussion earlier in this chapter the characteristic feature of these particles is that they have no capability of independent motion and are therefore stationary in the natural system of reference it follows that they are moving at unit speed the speed of light in the cont text of the conventional spatial reference system according to our findings there are three categories of material particles combinations of motions without enough rotational displacement to form the atomic type of structure these are one massless particles two similar particles that have acquired mass and three particles with structures intermediate between those of Class 2 and and the full atomic structure this table lists the subatomic particles of material sector the mass one hydrogen isotope is included in this list because of its intermediate type of structure although it is generally regarded as a fullscale atom electric charges that may be present are not shown except in the case of the one dimensional charge particles where they provide the rotational vibration that brings these particles into the gravitationally bound system charges applied to other particles in the list have no significant effect on the phenomena now being considered so uh his table subatomic particles starting with the massless particles we&#x27;ve got the photon um and then we have which is not notated and then we have M 0-0-0 the rotational base we have M 0- 0-1 the electron and then um we have uh the charged neutrino m 12-2-1 uh we have the positron M 0-0-1 we have the neutrino again M 12-2-1 uh we have the massless neutron M 12-1 12-0 okay so those are the massless particles now he&#x27;s got the particles with Mass Mass uh that is the charged electron M 0- 0-1 or-1 and the charge positron um positive uh M 0-0-1 and then we also have the proton M 1-1-1 then we have the intermediate systems uh where there are two uh components um the compound Neutron being M 1-1-1 along with C- 12-2-1 so those two together are the compound Neutron and then the mass one hydrogen isotope is combination of M 1-1-1 and M 12-2 d 1ga 1 uh the mass one hydrogen isotope okay an exact duplicate of table 36 lists exists in the cosmic sector with the speed displacements inverted in this case the particles are built on the cosmic rotational base represented as C 0- 0-0 rather than the material base m0 - 0-0 the particles not listed in table 35 um that the physicists claim to have discovered msons Etc are combinations of the cosmic type either particles from the cosmic subatomic list or full-sized Cosmic atoms where the presumed discoveries are authentic it is even possible that some of the events of extremely short duration attributed to transient particles may be originated by Cosmic chemical compounds recognition of the place of the massless particles in the evolutionary pattern of matter matter is one of the um advances in understanding that has given us the present consistent and apparently correct explanation of the trans transition from cosmic to material and vice versa the 1959 publication identified the cyclic nature of the universe and gave an account of the manner in which the uh transitions between sectors take place at that time however the existence of the massless particles had not yet been discovered theoretically and the particle now identified as the compound Neutron was thought to be the intermedi intermediary by means of which intersector transfer is accomplished when it was finally realized that the theory requires the existence of a massless neutron the door to a new understanding of the transition process was opened it then became evident that the transition is not directly from cosmic to material but from cosmic moving inward in time to neutral no motion relative to the Natural reference system and then to material moving inward in space this finding Revolution revolutionized our concept of the position of the massless particles in the physical picture it can now be seen that those particles these particles the neutrino known to Conventional science the massless electron and massless proton uh positron previously uh identified as the moving particles in electric currents the massless neutron the rotational base and the gravitationally charged neutrino discovered theoretically are the constituents of a hitherto unknown subdivision of physical existence a neutral state of the basic units of matter intermediate between the states of the cosmic and material sector in as much as the atom building process operates by means of successive additions of in of single units the relative proportions of the various elements in a material aggregate are directly related to the age of the matter and inversely related to the atomic number however there are are a number of collateral factors that modify the basic relations as we have seen production of the mass one isotope of hydrogen is a relatively simple matter involving nothing more than a union of two simple particles the next step is more difficult because it requires the formation of a double system in which there are effective rotational displacements in both components the great majority of the material atoms are therefore still in the hydrogen stage the First full double system helium atomic number two is in second place as would be expected Beyond this level Atomic rotation becomes more complex and factors other than the required number of additions of mass units introduce numerous irregularities into what would otherwise be a regular decrease of abundance with atomic number evidently a single addition to the atomic rotation introduces uh a degree of asymmetry that decreases stability e as the even numbered elements are generally more abundant than the odd-numbered elements for instance the 10 most abundant elements Beyond hydrogen in the Earth&#x27;s crust includes seven even numbered elements and only three with odd atomic numbers the zone of isot isotopic stability is likewise wider in the even numbered than in the odd numbered elements as would be expected if they are inherently more stable many of the odd numbered group have only one stable isotope and there are five within the 117 element range of the terrestrial environment that have no stable isotope at all in that environment on the other hand no even numbered element other than burum has less than two stable isotopes the same kind of symmetry effect can be seen in the first additions of rotation in the magnetic Dimensions the positive elements of group 2A lithium brillium and Boron are relatively scarce while the corresponding members of group 2B sodium magnesium and aluminum are relatively abundant at higher levels this effect is not apparent probably because the successive additions to these heavier elements are smaller in proportion to the total mass while the effects of other factors become more significant one of the features of the rotational patterns of the elements that introduces variations in their susceptibility to the addition of mass and corresponding variations in the proportions in which the different elements occur in material Aggregates is the change in magnetic rotation that takes place at the midpoint of each rotational group for example let us again consider the 2B group of elements the first three of these elements are formed by successive additions of positive Electric displac m to the 2-2 magnetic rotation silicon the next element is produced by a similar addition and the probability of its formation does not differ materially from that of the pre of the three preceding elements another such addition however would bring the speed displacement to 22 2-2-5 which is unstable in order to form the stable equival equalent of 3- 2- -3 the magnetic displacement must be increased by one unit in one dimension the probability of accomplishing this result is considerably lower than that of merely adding one electric displacement unit and the step from Silicon to phosphorus is consequently more difficult than the additions immediately proceeding the total amount of silicon in existence therefore builds up to the point where the lower probability of the next addition reaction is offset by the larger number of silicon atoms available to participate in the reaction as a result silicon should theoretically be one of the most abundant of the post helium elements the same consideration should apply to the elements at the midpoints of the other rotational groups when the consideration is given to the general decrease in abundance that takes place as the atomic number increases we will see as we will see in volume three there are reasons to believe that the composition of ordinary matter at the end of the first phase of its existence in the material sector the dust cloud phase conforms to these theoretical expectations however the abundances of the various element elements in the region accessible to direct observation a region in a later stage of development give us a different picture the total heavy element content does increase with the age of the matter a representation a representative evaluation finds the percentage of elements heavier than helium ranging from uh Point uh 0.3 in the globular clusters theoretically the Young Stellar Aggregates that are observable to 4.0 in the population one stars and Interstellar dust in the Solar neighborhood theoretically the oldest matter within convenient observational range these are approximations of course but the general trend is clear the peaks in the abundance curve that should theoretically exist at the midpoints of the rotational groups also make their appearance at the appr apprpriate points in the lower groups of elements the situation with respect to carbon is somewhat uncertain because the observations are conflicting but silicon is relatively abundant compared to the neighboring elements as it theoretically should be and iron the predominant member of the trio of elements at the midpoint of group 3A is almost as abundant as silicon but when we turn to the corresponding members of the 3B group ruthenium rodium and padium we find a totally different situation instead of being relatively abundant as would be expected from their position in the atomic series just ahead of another increase in the magnetic displacement these elements are rare this does not necessarily mean that the relative probability effect due to the magnetic displacement step is absent as all of the as all of the neighor ing elements are likewise rare in fact all elements beyond the iron nickel group exist not exist only in comparatively minute quantities estimates indicate that the combined amount of all of these elements in existence is less than 1% of the existing amount of iron it does not appear possible to explain the relative abundances in terms of the probability concept alone a fairly substantial decrease in abundance compared to Iron would be in order if the age of the local system were such as to put the peak of probability somewhere in the vicinity of iron but this should still leave the ruthenium group among the relatively common elements the nearly complete elimination of the heavy elements including this group which should theoretically be quite plentiful requires the existence of some additional Factor either one an almost insurmountable obstacle to the formation of elements beyond the iron group or to a process that destroys these elements after they are produced there is no indication of the existence of any serious obstacle that interferes with the formation of the heavy elements so far as we can determine the atom building process is just as applicable to the heavy elements as to the light ones the building of heavy elements is endothermic but this should not be a serious obstacle as in any event it does not apply below group 4 a and therefore has no bearing on the scarcity of the 3B and lower division 3A elements The Peculiar distribution tion of abundances therefore seems to require the existence of a destructive process that prevents the accumulation of any substantial quantities of the elements heavier than the iron group even though they are produced in the normal amounts we have already seen in chapter 17 that such a process exists this process will be examined in detail in volume three Universe of motion on astronomy where it will be shown that the theoretical results of the process are in full agreement with the obser observed distribution of the abundances of the elements the entire atom building process described in this chapter is duplicated in the cosmic sector with space and time interchanged here the inverse mass is added to move the elements up the cosmic atomic syst series okay that is the end of chapter 26 Adam building and um Marson is kind of setting the stage for his book on astronomy Universe of motion there uh where he gets into the reason why there are very few elements um beyond the iron nickel group um and um we are up to the final chapter of this book which we&#x27;ve been laboring on for a very long time but uh you know not so much just because it&#x27;s on chemistry and that we need to learn chemistry but to see how larsson&#x27;s thought process works how he takes his postulates and applies them um so that we can and also do the same uh in our own field of study that&#x27;s the beauty of the reciprocal system is that is a generalized Theory um so that if you understand how it operates then you can use it to apply it to whatever subject you&#x27;d like and so when we can take a look at how Larson applies his theory to various subjects we can glean how to apply it to the subject objects that we&#x27;d like to apply to and again I believe that in the future distant or uh you know really could be could be close close by um that science will be not science just science but all all uh curriculum our whole whole you know academic curriculum from the liberal arts to the science is you know um the religion and uh every every possible form of understanding will be founded on the reciprocal system of theory um now there might be other other ways of knowing other theories that are appended to that but I believe that the reciprocal system will be the foundation and so we might as well learn it now get in on the ground floor and that way by the time everybody else discovers how important this is you&#x27;ll already be you know a leg up and you will be able to Parlay your um you know your knowledge and expertise in an area where there is great demand as of right now there is practically no demand but uh you know this is kind of like investing you know you try to see the trends you try to see what what&#x27;s coming and then you invest uh in your future and I believe that uh the future is very bright for the human race because uh for one reason one reason is because of um the uh potential of the reciprocal system of theory so hopefully you&#x27;ll delve into some of my other works on this subject um my other videos and and uh get yourself a working knowledge of the reciprocal system dive into larsson&#x27;s work and uh work of some of his associates and um you know do it with an open mind not to debunk everything right off the bat but to um suspend disbelief if he says something that flies in the face of what you already believe um be able to you know hold multiple points of view in your head at the same time and uh just have an open mind okay uh thanks for tuning in today and uh we&#x27;ll be back with the beginning of the Final Chapter math and energy uh in basic properties of matter tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great</p>
