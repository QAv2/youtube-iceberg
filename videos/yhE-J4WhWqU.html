            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>you do in several ways create your own reality. Now, physicists have gotten to about the same place. The atom smasher smashers over in CERN and and the quantum physicists doing theory, they&#x27;ve pretty much come to the conclusion that consciousness is the very base of our reality. Can one elevate their consciousness to then get what they want? What do you think? Yes, that that&#x27;s the way it works. All you have to do is practice.</p>
<p>You can use your intent to change things here to change what happens to modify future probability with our intent. That&#x27;s the same way people heal with their minds. Mental healing is a real thing and it depends on the amount of uncertainty that is in that happening. All we have to do is develop the intuitive part of our mind. Scientists worldwide have been shifting their attention towards consciousness to understand on a quantum level how our reality works and how we work with on our reality to create the lives of our dreams to understand how you and how I can create the realities that we desire.</p>
<p>And in today&#x27;s conversation, I&#x27;m bringing on Thomas Campbell, a leading pioneer in consciousness research. Thomas Campbell actually began his career as a nuclear physicist and systems engineer at NASA and the department of defense. Then he shifted his career and has been studying and researching consciousness over the last 40 years. We dive into what is consciousness? What have these scientists discovered in the last many years? How does this change our perception of reality and how we can manipulate our own realities today? And what does this mean for our potential? Let&#x27;s get into it. What I think it makes sense to really start with is kind of the foundation of the work that you&#x27;ve done where you kind of to to to summarize you have expressed that you and I we are consciousness and we&#x27;re basically having a virtual experience more or less to grow.</p>
<p>Love is ultimately the goal. Fear is kind of like the challenge. Um and that reality is digital in a sense if we could look at it that way and that we are far more than what our body is. So in a to a degree like our body is sort of like the avatar and you know our consciousness is sort of using the avatar to exist in this digital reality. That&#x27;s kind of the foundation of how you understand through all your work what reality is.</p>
<p>Is that right? That&#x27;s correct. Okay. So, with that foundation, you&#x27;ve been studying this as a physicist, right? For like 37 years or something. Yeah, probably more. I&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve been on this path um at least since my uh middle to late 20s.</p>
<p>And right now I am 80 going on 81. So, that&#x27;s a lot of years. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve put a lot of time into this. That&#x27;s a lot of time. Can you help me understand how you define consciousness and what role consciousness plays today in our concept of reality? Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I have a very simple definition of consciousness and that is that it is awareness with a choice. Now, that has a lot of subtext to it. If you have a choice, then you must have free will. If there is no free will, there is no choice. The opposite of free will is determinism where you don&#x27;t evolve, you don&#x27;t change, you don&#x27;t grow.</p>
<p>Everything just is and nothing changes. So awareness with a choice, that&#x27;s consciousness. Now, how does that play into our individual lives and into a theory of reality and so on? Well, one of the things I learned in studying consciousness from the inside, which means studying my own consciousness and how it worked and exploring uh altered states of consciousness. And again, I&#x27;m like you. I was also about 26 when I stopped drinking and I never drank very much but occasionally Mexican restaurants you&#x27;d get a beer you know that sort of thing but I stopped I stopped all alcohol and I stopped all caffeine and I didn&#x27;t smoke so there was no nicotine but basically I wanted to get everything that was psychotropic that means it affects your central nervous system I I wanted to get all of that out of my system because if you&#x27;re exploring consciousness and then you take things that alter your consciousness, you&#x27;re you&#x27;re just getting in your way of what it is you can discover because you&#x27;re you&#x27;re discovering things that are not natural to the human being.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re discovering the the effects that substances have on that person. So anyway, I quit about the same time around 26 or so. I gave it all up because I was out at Bob Monroe&#x27;s laboratory and was studying consciousness and I was studying my own consciousness taking trips uh out into the consciousness realm if you say outside of this reality and for that I needed a very clear head. So there doing those things I learned that consciousness was fundamental. And the way I learned that was that I could do things within consciousness that would affect the physical reality, change the physical reality.</p>
<p>But there was nothing that could be done inside the physical reality that actually modified consciousness or changed consciousness. So the arrow of causality goes from consciousness to the physical world. That puts consciousness as the fundamental thing and the physical world as something that&#x27;s a creation of consciousness. Now physicists have gotten to about the same place. those that do, you know, the the atom smasher smashers over in CERN and and the quantum physicists doing theory, they&#x27;ve pretty much come to the conclusion that reality is information-based.</p>
<p>And the science just tells them that uh if you think of an electron as a as a tiny little particle with with a charge and with mass, you can&#x27;t get the right answers. That will not compute. You can&#x27;t uh you can&#x27;t work with it that way. You have to work with an electron as a point with the attributes of charge and mass which is the way you would model an electron in a computer. In other words, they see that reality is informationbased.</p>
<p>So that kind of matched pretty well with my idea of consciousness as fundamental because eventually after about 35 years of thinking about it and experimenting and testing it um I realized that consciousness is best modeled or best described as an information system. Now what how does consciousness work? Well, you you u take in data. You have input which is your eyes, nose, ears, you know, your taste buds, uh your skin, you feel. So, you&#x27;ve got five senses. They&#x27;re basically uh input data.</p>
<p>You take that input data and you process it. You compare it to what you remember from other taking in of input data and then you create some kind of action. What are you going to do with that input data? Is it important? Do you have to act on it? Uh so what is it that takes in information, processes it, uses memory, and then comes to a conclusion and does an action? Well, that&#x27;s an information system. That&#x27;s what information systems do. So once I saw consciousness as an information system then a whole lot of things cleared up and I was trying to develop a a general understanding of consciousness and how it could be the the core the the thing that was fundamental because that means you have to derive physics say from consciousness.</p>
<p>If consciousness is fundamental, then physics isn&#x27;t. And you have to be able to derive it from consciousness. And eventually about 2 or 3 years after I published my trilogy, I uh figured out how to do that. How to uh derive quantum physics and relativity both just from the attributes and nature of consciousness. So that kind of put all the puzzle pieces together.</p>
<p>So consciousness as a as a fundamental thing is the very base of our reality. That&#x27;s that is the fundamentals of reality. Now we live in what I call a virtual reality, but it&#x27;s just as easy to say what the physicists would say. It&#x27;s a it&#x27;s an information-based reality. Virtual realities are information-based realities.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re computed realities. And there&#x27;s reasons why, you know, why that exists and and how it exists and what led to it and what the purpose is and all of those things we can talk about later if you wish. But that&#x27;s just the basis of why you know what consciousness is. It&#x27;s awareness and it has choices and by those choices it can evolve or deeolve, improve itself or disimprove itself. And that um you know if we want to maybe derive that we could do that in about 15 20 minutes but basically what it boils down to is that an information system um evolves.</p>
<p>Now remember this is an aware information system. It&#x27;s consciousness. So it&#x27;s a conscious system. It&#x27;s not just a a machine. This is a conscious information system.</p>
<p>And an information system, any information system, conscious or not, evolves by lowering its entropy. Now, entropy is a is a measure of disorder. So, if you take an information system and all of the bits are random, then that&#x27;s the maximum amount of disorder you can have. Just by the definition of randomness, no information. You order a few of those bits, then you&#x27;ve created information.</p>
<p>that ordered set of bits can stand for something. It can be a symbol. It could be a number. It could be something that uh now remains. So, can I ask you a question about that? Sure.</p>
<p>Sure. So, so with the goal of consciousness, so just to recap a little bit about what this means because this is complex if you don&#x27;t have any back information on this, right? I mean it&#x27;s complex with back and backtory information but um you know luckily I&#x27;ve read your books and listened to you on podcast consciousness like what you&#x27;re saying with consciousness is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s fundamental meaning it&#x27;s the foundation of our reality before this most people have relied solely on what Einstein would typically place it doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re you&#x27;re not like debunking Einstein he would say spacetime and matter and energy is fundamental but you&#x27;re what it sounds like is you&#x27;re saying consciousness is before that essentially right yes I am saying that but actually Einstein he started out thinking that uh quantum physics had to be wrong because it uh it was it showed that that um materialism was not the right idea because there it did things that that um a materialist system could not do. So if he was said there&#x27;s something wrong here with quantum physics and he took that path for probably about 5 10 years. Um and then once count once there were enough experiments done in quantum physics he saw that it indeed was the truth. it did work like they said.</p>
<p>He switched and in one of his quotes in a letter to to uh Balm, another physicist who was British and and worked with Einstein. Matter of fact, Balm had studied with Einstein. So, they were good good friends. and he wrote a letter that said, &quot;I know that consciousness is fundamental and that somehow everything else has to spring from consciousness, but I don&#x27;t have any idea how to represent that in me.&quot; Okay. You know, so he claimed that by the by the end.</p>
<p>Yeah. So he knew that and so did all the founding fathers of quantum physics. every one of them uh because of what&#x27;s called the double slit experiment, every one of them realized that consciousness was more fundamental. Uh Max Plank said you can&#x27;t get behind consciousness. Everything else is a derivative of consciousness.</p>
<p>So those physicists were all on board with the concept, but they had no idea how to make that into a theory. You know, how do how do you put that in an equation? How do you take that and and explain physics with it? How do you explain the speed of light&#x27;s a constant? How do you explain why quantum physics is based on probability? And why are things like that? So, they got stuck there. And that&#x27;s been now about a hundred years since they got stuck. And we&#x27;re still just as stuck as we were because science has in those years after the founders of quantum physics, they got more and more in deeper into the belief of materialism. And at this point it&#x27;s hard for many of them to look outside of that.</p>
<p>The quantum physicists are are more outside of that than the others because they see that that uh you know reality is is basically information based and most of the others are not. Yeah. And it&#x27;s with the with the concept of consciousness of like that&#x27;s fundamental. What you were getting at before was that one of the major goals of consciousness is to reduce entropy, reduce chaos, and create order. And so that can, you know, that can happen.</p>
<p>It sounds like in like the evolution of one person, right? Like you kind of are growing up and that&#x27;s what is happening in your life. Is it fair to say that um and I want to ask you a follow-up to this. Is it fair to say that fear and anxiety equates to disorder and love and let&#x27;s say acceptance equates to order as it pertains to consciousness. Yes, that&#x27;s fair. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s actually correct.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not only fair, but that is the way it is. And here is why. Consciousness is a social system. It&#x27;s a bunch of individuated units of consciousness, pieces of consciousness interacting with each other and with the system. In a social system, the way you optimize that social system is through cooperation, caring, sharing, um, compassion.</p>
<p>All those things will optimize it. Um, because they they lower entropy. That&#x27;s what I mean by optimize it. you optimize by finding a low entropy uh solution. So that is low entropy and the way you can think of this is give a group of people say 100,000 people and and give them a certain amount of resources that they have to work with and then just let them go and see what they do with the resources.</p>
<p>That group that is sharing, caring, cooperative, works together, uh they will do a whole lot more with those resources. They will optimize the lives of everyone given the resources they have. Now take the opposite group over on the and I call that the the love side. On the fear side, well, if you&#x27;re fearful, then you don&#x27;t trust. If you don&#x27;t trust, you don&#x27;t cooperate.</p>
<p>If you find something new, you discover something, well, you don&#x27;t share it. You hold it close to the vest, hoping you can profit from it or sell it or uh make people give you things for it. So in one reality everyone optimized. Everyone is optimized with the resources they have. Everybody wants everybody else to succeed to do what they want to explore what they want to do.</p>
<p>Whereas in the fear-based reality eventually you&#x27;ll have groups will form because two or three people can take things away from single people. So you have these groups and then the single people all get together and make a group and you have groups of self-defense. They tend to war with each other and eventually you end up if you follow the logic you end up with, you know, 3% of the people owning 90% of all the of the resources and everybody else is kind of at the bottom, the peasants who do all the work, which is kind of where we live now. that I call that a a uh a society that that has the ethic of control, power and force. So the the that that ethic as opposed to the ethic of cooperation, caring and and helpfulness.</p>
<p>So yes, those that is true and the point of consciousness is to lower entropy and that means to make things work better, cooperate, caring and not just work better for a few people but work better for everyone and not just all the people but all the animals and all the plants and work better in general for for everything. And if your society does that, then you&#x27;ve optimized the possibilities of what that society can produce and what it can do. So yes, that&#x27;s true. You have the the point of of evolution is to make choices and by those choices you either move closer to being a being of love or closer to being a being of fear. And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re here for, to experience this reality and make choices and grow up or not grow up.</p>
<p>H Have you Have you heard of Abraham Hicks before? Yes, I&#x27;ve heard of him, but I&#x27;m not real familiar with his work. Well, actually, so I I I would I would think this would be fascinating for you to dive into um because it actually kind of goes into a little bit of what Donald Hoffman talks about in a way. If you&#x27;re familiar with Donald Hoffman, he&#x27;s a physicist. Yeah. So he I&#x27;ve only watched one or two um podcasts with his work.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t read his book yet, but from what I understand he kind of dives a lot into the concept of like the observer effect um where essentially you the way you perceive of reality actually kind of like creates reality, right? So quite literally how you think of something or perceive of something renders it in a sense. um as a result of whatever it is that you&#x27;re thinking is from what I understand uh as a really dumbed down version of what he how he describes it. I know there&#x27;s a lot missing there. Um but the way that going back to Abraham Hicks actually Abraham Hicks um interestingly is is actually a woman and she the whole premise of what she speaks about is the concepts of frequencies and vibrations and how fundamental that is to kind of our entire realities. And so a lot of what Abraham Hicks talks about is how the way you think about something or your belief system or the emotions that you have will define your reality.</p>
<p>So if you have she she&#x27;s always thinking towards like the more love you have and acceptance you have and um appreciation one has you know the kind of like prepaving of your life will be better smoother. You&#x27;ll have a better result around you. And that kind of aligns with what Donald Hoffman talks about in terms of the quantum side of things of your, you know, the the observer effect. So with that said, how do you see frequencies and vibrations playing into this greater picture of consciousness andor the observer effect? Does this make sense in your world? Well, uh, yes and no. Uh, the effects all are exactly right.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s true. you do in several ways create your own reality and in some ways you don&#x27;t um your intentions you know if you are happy if you are positive if you&#x27;re loving and caring then your life will probably be happy you&#x27;ll smile a lot uh life will be good and you will feel fulfilled and enjoy you&#x27;ll be a happy person if you are negative and fearful and um self-centered, then your life will be a life of struggle. It&#x27;ll be a life of hardship and difficulty. And you just if you just could get past that that next barrier. Everything would be great, but then when you do, you find there&#x27;s another barrier just a little bit further ahead on your path.</p>
<p>So that part is all true and we do influence our our reality. But it isn&#x27;t because of frequencies. That&#x27;s a very common way to describe it. And if you take those frequencies as metaphors, then it&#x27;s a perfectly fine way to describe it. It&#x27;s a metaphorical approach, but it&#x27;s not actually the way it works.</p>
<p>But, you know, you can you can make a good story with it. And like I say, as metaphors, you can say, well, as we grow up, our frequency raises, and as we, you know, de evolve, our frequency lowers, and you can see how people in uh interact with each other&#x27;s frequencies. And you can make a lot of of um pretty rational uh models there. But frequency is not fundamental. Frequency is a concept that&#x27;s based in the physical.</p>
<p>A frequency means something changes, something moves back and forth. Okay, we have a metronome, you know, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, you know, that has a frequency. How many ticks, you know, does it have per second? That&#x27;s its frequency. So frequency has to do with repetitive motion per unit time kind of say that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the fundamental of frequency. But now when we talk about consciousness, we&#x27;re not talking about phys physical things anymore.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about something that is outside of this physical reality. So talking about it in terms of physical things moving back and forth, you know, in time just isn&#x27;t quite, you know, the best metaphor to use. So I agree with all the with all the conclusions, not just a description of how it works. So the way it does work is that well I told you there was a couple of ways and I so I&#x27;ll mention them. The simplest way that we define our own reality is we get a we get a data stream in a virtual reality.</p>
<p>You get a data stream and you interpret that data to be your reality. So, you&#x27;re playing the Sims. The SIM server sends you a data stream. That data stream lights up, say, 2 million pixels on your monitor. You look at two million dots of light.</p>
<p>And you see rivers and streams and people and houses and doorork knobs. You see all the physical things there. When you look at those dots of light, you interpret those to be those physical things. Okay? That&#x27;s your interpretation. That your interpretation comes from your own experience base.</p>
<p>all the things you&#x27;ve experienced and learned in your life gives you a way to interpret that data. Like the perception of it, right? Pardon? Sorry, I I just want to make sure I&#x27;m clear on that. Like the way you&#x27;re seeing it, are you saying that like if I&#x27;m looking perception of it? Yes. Yeah. Like if I&#x27;m looking at this screen though and you&#x27;re looking at the screen, we&#x27;re both seeing a screen still, right? Mhm.</p>
<p>Okay. So, but our perception it of the screen has changed based off of our our lives. our our perception of what it means to us. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>What what does how do we interpret that screen? All right. It&#x27;s just a thing. You see a an old guy with white hair and a red shirt. And you know, you look at that and that just is, you know, and I see the same thing. I see an old guy with white hair and a red shirt, too.</p>
<p>But what that means to you, the significance of it, the meaning of it, the the value of it is something that you add to that and that that&#x27;s based on what&#x27;s inside of your mind, your own understanding, your own knowledge. So you interpret it to be some value. Now, if there&#x27;s nothing going on here other than just, you know, a face, then okay, we see a picture of each other and that&#x27;s it. But there&#x27;s really that&#x27;s not very interesting. It&#x27;s not a very you know that&#x27;s not meaning the meaningfulness of it is how you interpret the words I say you you know I say words that&#x27;s a data stream I say words and you have to interpret them and you may interpret them in a way that I didn&#x27;t intend or you may interpret them perfectly but it&#x27;s your interpretation.</p>
<p>So reality is your interpretation of the information that you get. So as long as we are getting information about things we&#x27;re familiar with, then our interpretation is very accurate. As soon as we start getting things that are say outside of our culture, outside of our understanding, outside of what&#x27;s familiar to us, we tend to make a lot of mistakes about how to interpret it. We don&#x27;t know how to interpret it. So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one way you modify your reality is how you interpret it because your interpretation is your reality.</p>
<p>So a lot of people would say what&#x27;s the story you&#x27;re telling yourself in a in a in a dumbed down version of that that would be more of a therapeutic approach honestly like it really could be like okay what is the story you are telling yourself and that is defining your reality now now is that is that literally changing molecules in reality? No, no. It&#x27;s just changing your reality. Yeah. Okay. There are there are no molecules in reality.</p>
<p>Okay. Reality is information. So you don&#x27;t have to change molecules in reality. Your consciousness and the way you interpret the data you get is your reality. Your reality is just information.</p>
<p>Our reality is information-based. So that&#x27;s one way that we change our reality. Now you mentioned this earlier. You said um you know as you grew up as you got to be more positive as you as you uh um dealt with your fears and so on you you stopped drinking alcohol. Things changed and your reality changed.</p>
<p>The way you saw things, the way you interpreted things, the things were important and the things that were not. All of that changed. Well, that change was because you changed. You started seeing the world differently. It was the same world out there, but you saw it differently.</p>
<p>Some things that used to not make any difference to you suddenly did and things that did before didn&#x27;t. So you modify your reality, right, by your own story. You have your own story and that is your reality. It&#x27;s a mistake to think that there is some kind of physical reality out there now that has to change. There isn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>Your reality is is your own your own story of what happens and why it happens and the significance of it. Now the other thing is that we have in this reality we have a feedback system because this is real. This reality is really a schoolhouse. We&#x27;re here for for a reason. And we have the ability to modify future probability with our intent.</p>
<p>Okay. So, in a in a in this virtual reality, the way the system knows what&#x27;s going to happen next is it takes a random draw from a probability distribution of the possibilities. Now, that sounds kind of complicated, but that&#x27;s how it knows what happens next. So, what happens next? What gets rendered next is that random draw from that probability distribution of the possibilities. Now you get to modify those probabilities.</p>
<p>So you get to modify what happens next. So yes, you can use your intent to change things here to change what happens. And it depends on the amount of uncertainty that is in that happening. So that&#x27;s another way we get to create our own reality. So, let&#x27;s say just for an example, you are going to have a family picnic next Saturday and you&#x27;d like it to be sunny, not rainy.</p>
<p>So, you and and all the rest of your family start putting an intention thinking about it&#x27;s going to be sunny. It&#x27;s going to be a beautiful day. We&#x27;re going to have a lovely picnic. And in your mind, you kind of see that picnic and that it&#x27;s nice and sunny and pleasant and everybody has a good time. And that actually changes the probability of it being sunny.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve modifi because you&#x27;ve modified the probability distribution. So now when they take that random draw from a probability distribution of the possibilities, those probability distributions have been modified by your intention. That&#x27;s the same way people heal with their minds. Mental healing is a real thing. That&#x27;s uh the same way that uh you know people who are very happy and positive kind of draw happy and positive things toward them.</p>
<p>They deal with things that aren&#x27;t happy and positive very well. So it&#x27;s the same sort of thing. If you&#x27;re sad, if you&#x27;re mopy, if you complain a lot, then you draw a lot of negative things to you. And the way I say draw it to you, you just change the probabilities of those negative things happening. So if we don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s happening in the world and we&#x27;re all worried about it and upset about it and angry about it, we just feed those probabilities rather than change them.</p>
<p>Like I so it&#x27;s I&#x27;ve heard often that the what you give attention to you grow basically you you allow to evolve. And it seems so counterintuitive but this goes back to the frequency concepts. And I really do find that I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of value out of understanding things through the frequency lens because um you know it it&#x27;s like what they what a lot of people teach in that space. What I&#x27;ve experienced is the like we were just saying the more attention you give to something the bigger it gets. What we often want to do is when we see a problem we want to solve it.</p>
<p>Um but in a lot of teachings it sounds like well when you see the problem and more attention is given to it the bigger the problem gets actually which seems weird because isn&#x27;t entropy the act of reducing problems? Yes. Like aren&#x27;t we designed to do to reduce problems? Yeah. Here&#x27;s here&#x27;s the difference. It depends on where your intent is coming from. It&#x27;s your it&#x27;s the root of this intention.</p>
<p>So if you&#x27;re you say, &quot;Oh, here&#x27;s a bad thing.&quot; And if you have the attitude of, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s a bad thing. So I&#x27;m going to go and I&#x27;m going to stop it. I&#x27;m going to tell those people to stop doing this and I&#x27;m going to do that.&quot; And basically, you are going to to push or force or cajul or however you can to fix the problem. So you go in to manipulate things to make it better. Okay, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one way of looking at it.</p>
<p>you go in with a force to change it. Now, if if all the time that you&#x27;re changing it, you see this this is the bad thing and I have to get rid of it. All of that is self-centered. I know what&#x27;s right. I&#x27;m the one that that understands how things should be and I&#x27;m going to make it the way I know it&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s very self-centered. Everybody in that in that problem feels the same way. They feel that they know what&#x27;s right. So that isn&#x27;t going to be helpful. That&#x27;s going to make it worse.</p>
<p>But if you go into it with the idea that all of these people are struggling and trying to do the best they can with the situation they&#x27;ve got and what they really need is some positiveness. So I&#x27;m going to go in and I&#x27;m going to make friends with everybody. I&#x27;m going to give a lot of hugs. I&#x27;m going to be happy. I&#x27;m going to be positive.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to uh offer my solutions, but I&#x27;m not going to try to implement them. I&#x27;m just going to offer them and see what the other people think and stay very positive with those people. You will do more good to fix that problem in that way. Now, you&#x27;re lowering entropy instead of raising it. If you go into a problem angry that the problem even exists and that these dumb people are perpetuating it, you&#x27;re just going to make the problem worse.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s how that works. So yes, you are to lower entropy, but the way you approach that lowering entropy is important. You have to approach it from a very positive viewpoint, not a manipulative bully. I&#x27;m going to fix things the way I know it&#x27;s right. If you go with that attitude, all you&#x27;ll do is make it worse.</p>
<p>Because when you start pushing those people in the direction you know is best, they will resent it and they will push back. They won&#x27;t say, &quot;Oh, thank you for correcting my my ideas.&quot; And they don&#x27;t people don&#x27;t act like that. They&#x27;ll push back and they&#x27;ll double down on their ideas and now you&#x27;ve just made it worse. So, right, you go in and not challenge or, you know, belittle or push at people. you go in and and uh try to offer some suggestions that are positive and you&#x27;ll see that eventually it&#x27;ll change because most of the problem is just the negativity that the people have in the first place and if you can help reduce that then the problem will get better.</p>
<p>So if if I were to like how in the world did you quantify this mathematically, you know, like ho how did you do that? Well, you know, that&#x27;s one of the uh differences um between myself and um yeah, Donald Hoffman is that Donald Hoffman, of course, he&#x27;s a he came out of MIT with computer science and then went into cognitive research and he&#x27;s a very smart fellow and and very deep into into science. He&#x27;s a good guy. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve talked with him several times. we&#x27;ve had meetings and and uh you know talks together and he does have it right and recently he started saying that uh consciousness is fundamental which he didn&#x27;t start out saying that but he&#x27;s come come around to that that conclusion yeah and in any case one of the things that I told him I said Donald you don&#x27;t have to make it all mathematical science does not have to be mathematical mathematics is the logic of quantity. That&#x27;s just it.</p>
<p>The logic of quantity. There&#x27;s logic in quantity. You know, I have two over here and I have three over here. You can count them up and there&#x27;s five. You know, that&#x27;s quantity.</p>
<p>The logic of quantity. So, all of math is just the logic of quantity. But there&#x27;s more than just quantity. Now, in the the objective world, in the physical world, quantity is kind of the main thing. Everything has mass and size and takes up space, you know, has volume and you can pretty much describe everything in terms of quantity.</p>
<p>So, mathematics is just really good at describing the objective world. Consciousness is not a part of the objective world. Consciousness is not a material thing. Consciousness is from the viewpoint of the avatars. Consciousness is non-physical.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s more than just quantity. There&#x27;s also quality that is important. Okay. So much harder. You don&#x27;t have to you don&#x27;t have to do math.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t have to look at the the logic of quantity to describe consciousness. That will just end up chasing your tail around in a circle. But it won&#x27;t actually get you anywhere because consciousness is not about quantities of anything. Consciousness is doesn&#x27;t come from the physical. The brain doesn&#x27;t create consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is fundamental. It creates brains. It&#x27;s the opposite way. So that means that good science has to be logical, not mathematical. So take a look at Darwin&#x27;s theory.</p>
<p>Darwin&#x27;s theory was a very brilliant theory and it was based on observation. He made a lot of observations. From those observations he he deduced logical processes and that theory has been improved and broadened and whatever since Darwin and it explains so many things that we knew but didn&#x27;t understand. Like for instance in a in a a porpus or a dolphin they have in their fins they have finger bones look just like this. They have knuckles they have joints but of course they just stay flat all the time.</p>
<p>But yet here&#x27;s a like a hand same that we have you know fingers and a thumb and people said why would a dolphin in the sea you know not just have big stick of cartilage out there. Why would it have articulating, you know, joints that it doesn&#x27;t use? Well, it be used to be a land animal. It was one of the few that returned to the sea. So now Darwin comes along and oh, that&#x27;s why. So see, it gives us an explanation of things that were just mysterious.</p>
<p>But Darwin&#x27;s model, as successful at it as it has been, you know, you give a a biologist a cell, a single living cell, and they will evolve every plant and every being and and every critter and every bug that&#x27;s on the planet just from that cell through the theory of evolution. But there&#x27;s no math there or very little math there. But there&#x27;s logic. There&#x27;s good observation, careful observation, and logic. So science is based on logic not mathematics.</p>
<p>Now the non-physical or let&#x27;s say better the the um we could say the intuitive but the the uh subjective world is non-physical. It&#x27;s subjective. It it&#x27;s not about stuff. You know the subjective world is probably the most important part of our reality. It&#x27;s where justice and love and truth and kindness and all those things are subjective.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not objective. So anyway in the subjective world we talk about value and that value can be equated with quality. I talk about consciousness quality which is low entropy consciousness. So when we talk about consciousness, it&#x27;s not about a physical thing, which is why, you know, the vibration thing doesn&#x27;t actually literally work, but figuratively it works just fine. And it&#x27;s a nice model.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s lots of models we use like that. The chakras, okay, that&#x27;s a Hindu model of uh of energy centers, you know, with eight chakras from the base at the root chakra up to the crown chakra. There&#x27;s eight chakras. They&#x27;re not fundamental. They don&#x27;t really exist, but it&#x27;s a great methodology.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a great tool to help explain a lot of things that happen in consciousness. So, it&#x27;s not fundamental, but it&#x27;s useful and very significant. I&#x27;d say the same way with this frequency understanding. It&#x27;s a great tool. It&#x27;ll help people learn and understand things that are very complex, very abstract.</p>
<p>It gives them kind of a, you know, more concrete kind of feeling if you use that, but it&#x27;s not fundamental. But it is valuable. Well, one of the ways that I use it, and this is one of the reasons why I wonder if it could like what I changed in my life, changed my life quite a bit. And I I started waking up in the morning. I used to wake up with um crazy anxiety, like so bad, worried about everything.</p>
<p>I would wake up crying, like just miserable. And I started waking up and putting on immediately something that would like it was like a YouTube video that would like soothe me and it would distract me from the thoughts that I was habitually thinking that were fearful, anxious thoughts. So I would do that first. But then after like 20 or 30 minutes of doing that, I started and I started doing this by accident, but I started writing down everything good that happened yesterday. So it wasn&#x27;t like a list of like gratitude.</p>
<p>I just started from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed thinking about yesterday and I would only write things that felt good to think about from you know so so if it if anything felt kind of like h or that was edging on like a angsty topic I would it wouldn&#x27;t even touch the paper and I do this every single morning. So what I was doing is if I&#x27;m going to explain this from a scientific standpoint from what we know today, right? Like kind of working with the reticular activating system to train my mind to notice good things so that my perception of yesterday was really positive. Kind of like what you were talking about in terms of our perception creates our reality. And so I did that enough times to where I started having a totally different life experience and good things and good people started to come to me. But the other thing that was weird about it was I I feel like I started scripting my life.</p>
<p>Like the time that it happened the most powerfully to me was when I wanted to leave my hometown Denver and I said I just I was doing that whole writing thing and when I did that the reason I did that is it would elevate what what I&#x27;m trying to get to is it would elevate my sense of like my consciousness. So if my if you could measure consciousness which I don&#x27;t believe you know one really could but like in terms of frequencies here got all the way up here by the beginning to the end of that session in the morning. So I by the end of it I&#x27;m really happy excited positive um bright elated feeling and then I&#x27;m writing about what I want and I would write about what I wanted. I wanted to move to Austin. I wanted this type of job.</p>
<p>I wanted this this and it was like boom out of nowhere everything happened. And they were like big things that happened that were like a ton of money, a job, a new location, the perfect location, the perfect people. And it was everything I wrote. And so when I think about it, I&#x27;m like, is that a version? Like, can one elevate their consciousness to then get what they want? And and my intent was pure, too. I just wanted to be happy, you know? I really just wanted to be happy and I wanted to feel loved and like be loved and do my life the way I wanted it to do.</p>
<p>Sure. Yes. Yes. That that&#x27;s the way it works. That that is exactly right.</p>
<p>And the the uh metaphor of of frequency, you raised your frequency. That&#x27;s a nice metaphor. But what you actually did was that you started focusing on the positive. You stopped focusing on the negative. You stopped focusing on the fear.</p>
<p>and you started to focus on what was positive, what happened that was nice during the last day. And as you put your focus on that, then that did two things. One, it it just by itself made you feel better, made you happier because of where your focus was. But it also started modifying the probabilities of things that would happen in your in your future, those future probabilities. And as long as your mood and your thoughts were dark and frightening and fearful, then you would create more dark and fearful and so on things.</p>
<p>Once your once your your thoughts were more your intention was more to well, what&#x27;s good in life? What&#x27;s happy? What were my happy moments in the last day? What what good things happened? Now you start creating better things happening and yes that&#x27;ll change your life entirely just doing that because you&#x27;ve taken energy away from creating more anxiety and more fear. And if you think back about it, you will probably find that that anxiety and fear actually got worse over time. that it started and it was smaller and got worse and worse and worse because you were putting more energy into that you more of your intention was based in anxiety and fear. So as you changed where your focus was that started to change your reality and so literally the thoughts created my the thoughts gave energy to the reality I was then creating. Yes.</p>
<p>But now, yeah, there&#x27;s an important sidlight to that and that is if your thoughts had been very self-serving, very self-centered, then it wouldn&#x27;t have worked like it worked. The reason it worked for you is your thoughts weren&#x27;t self-centered. They were just about feeling good. It wasn&#x27;t about I&#x27;m so great. I&#x27;m so wonderful.</p>
<p>I deserve better things. It was just focus on the positive. You see, it was a it was a uh a low entropy thought, not a high entropy thought. So, if you go out there and you say, &quot;Ah, what I want is is, you know, a million dollars in a brand new Mercedes-Benz. I deserve that and I&#x27;m going to put my intent on it.&quot; It probably won&#x27;t happen because your intent is coming from the wrong place.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a self-s serving tent. What about me? And it&#x27;s not really lowering entropy for you know yourself and others. It&#x27;s not just a positive thought going in there. It&#x27;s more of a gimme I want thought. And the gimme I want thought carries some energy but very little.</p>
<p>Whereas the thought that is just happiness feels good. Yeah. I like this. It just feel I&#x27;ve got to do more of it and one it just builds just like the anxiety fed itself and got got more and more energy into the anxiety. The the happiness the the good feelings got more and more into those to where the whole thing switched for you.</p>
<p>But then the things you thought about well I want to get a a better job. I want to go to Austin. I want to do this. I want to do that. You had that positive intention.</p>
<p>Not just for because I want a lot of money so I can be better than other people so I can have more stuff and show all my friends all the stuff I have. That wouldn&#x27;t have worked very well. But you just wanted to be happy. You wanted to be positive. You wanted to do things.</p>
<p>You wanted to be, you know, uh you wanted to help other people grow up and get out of their their uh fear and their anxiety. You had positive attitudes. And because of that, you were able to produce the environment that was positive. And that happens to people who are positive. When you&#x27;re very positive and had a and have a a very healthy intent, you will find that whatever you need falls right at your feet just as you need it.</p>
<p>And your whole life will be that. Every day in your life will be just like that. and you begin to rely on that because you don&#x27;t really worry about too much about where the next, you know, thing is going to take you because as long as you stay positive, those things will just fall out in your favor because you have a positive attitude. And if you have a negative attitude, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the opposite. Barriers barriers will occur in front of you.</p>
<p>Every time you think you found an escape, a barrier will show up. It&#x27;s just the opposite of everything falling at your feet just as you need it to. So, it has to do with the low a low entropy intent versus a high entropy intent. Right. Okay.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s so true because the more and more ease and flow and like positive energy I flow towards something, I think about things that I like more or whatever, like actively doing that, the more comes to me. And I&#x27;m curious, too. I have I have two questions for you and we&#x27;ve only got what five minutes left or so. So, see if we can do both of these, but um have you read or listened to I should say listened to the podcast called the telepathy tapes? Yes. Matter of fact, I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve had several sessions with the lady who really uh No, not with Kai.</p>
<p>She she put it out there. She put it on film and and made it made it public, but it was um Diana. Yes, I&#x27;m speaking with her um in two months or something. Diana Campbell or Campbell or something like that. I&#x27;m just No, no, it&#x27;s not.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s Diana Hennessy Pal. That&#x27;s it. Diana Hennessy Pal. Hennessy Pal. Yeah, I&#x27;ve talked with her and the way that works, you know, everybody&#x27;s so shocked about how that works.</p>
<p>But the way that works is that if you are born autistic, then that part of your brain that that computes in the logical uh objective world just doesn&#x27;t work very well. You have a hard time with that. So what do you do? You start to develop what you do have and that&#x27;s your intuitive side. Mhm. So you start developing the intuitive side to make up for not having a a very good intellectual side or logical side.</p>
<p>So those kids can learn to do amazing things because they&#x27;ve developed their intuitive side. So when you get a a a kid that has autism and you say, &quot;What&#x27;s the what&#x27;s the cube root of 9,863?&quot; And they can tell you just like that. They don&#x27;t think about it. They&#x27;re not computing it. They just see the answer coming across in front of them and they&#x27;re just reading off the digits as they appear and they&#x27;ll be correct.</p>
<p>They can do that because all that information is available within consciousness. It&#x27;s all there. It&#x27;s part of a database that the rendering system needs in order to render the virtual reality. It&#x27;s all sitting there in a database. So, if I were to, let&#x27;s just say today, take my eyesight away, my my ability to move, my verbal capabilities, all of that, and maybe a few other things, movement, like, you know, I I really couldn&#x27;t move very much at all, um, or control my movement.</p>
<p>I would probably be forced to adapt to be able to communicate my needs or at least relate to my surroundings. And it sounds like that&#x27;s what these autistic these non-verbal autistic kids have become capable of doing or have always been capable of doing. But if I were to do that, is it would it be probable that over time I could potentially become telepathic? Is that kind of what you&#x27;re saying? Really? Yeah. But you don&#x27;t have to do that to do it. All you have to do is practice.</p>
<p>Most of us in the at least in in what we call the western world, we spend most of our lives polishing, honing and increasing our logical and intellectual abilities. We spend almost no time polishing and and and working on our intuitive capabilities. Consciousness has two separate ways that it processes information. One is the intellect, one is inuitive, one is logical, the other one is beyond logic. It doesn&#x27;t work on logic.</p>
<p>It just gets answers. Answers that are available within consciousness. You can develop that intuitive part and become telepathic. You can develop that intuitive part and go out of body. Uh you know, have mind-to- mind communications with people who aren&#x27;t even here, dead people.</p>
<p>You can do all kinds of things that are called paranormal. Paranormal just means we don&#x27;t understand how they work. But there is a logic behind them and they do work. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re a natural part of consciousness and all those things are available to every one of us. All we have to do is develop the intuitive part of our mind and that uh all those other things just are natural from that.</p>
<p>Just like we develop our intellect and now we can read books and we can you know have complex conversations and we can think about philosophy. We can do all those things with our logical mind. But our intuitive mind is not even as good as it was when we were 3 years old. When we were three years old our intuitive side was more developed than it is now for most people. So all of the people who are engaged in in what&#x27;s called paranormal are just people who have developed their intuitive side and they&#x27;ve developed little little uh things just like frequencies.</p>
<p>They they&#x27;ve developed little ways of explaining it to themselves but they don&#x27;t really understand how it works but they&#x27;ve just done it. So it&#x27;s it that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the way it works. You know, if you look at people who are psychic, look at mediums, and you&#x27;ll find a lot of them were in a very dysfunctional childhood. They had parents. Um, you know, I think of a friend of mine, Mara Freeze.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s a very good uh um medium, and she grew up with a a very abusive mother. And what happens when kids are abused is they start to withdraw from the objective world and they start to live in the subjective space because the subjective space is a lot nicer and the objective space where you know the rest of the world is is is kind of mean. So as very young children they start developing their intuitive side and start living there and start going there for comfort and now they grow up into adults and they realize that they can talk to dead people or other such things and it&#x27;s not like they realize it all of a sudden but one day they they they get a message that their grandfather&#x27;s going to die in three days and sure enough he does and they go oh my gosh I got that and then they start to play with it and then they they get better at it. So yes, that&#x27;s available to everybody and you don&#x27;t have to become autistic or shut other things off to do it. Matter of fact, you will be at your best if you have a very highly developed intuition and a very highly developed intellect.</p>
<p>Both because if you have both of those, they work together as a team. When you have just one side or the other, they don&#x27;t work well. The dominant side tends to bully the other side. So if you&#x27;re leftrain then your your intellect tends to bully your intuition and if you&#x27;re a rightrainer you know we call those people aircadets you know then then the right brain tends to bully the yeah the the left side. So how how how how would and then I&#x27;ve got to sadly sign off.</p>
<p>Would you be open to doing a second version of this a round two because there&#x27;s so much Sure. We can we can do it again. Oh man, this is just so of course you know we get into all this stuff. How would you describe the feeling of intuition? Because this is what I&#x27;ll tell you. I have personally felt myself.</p>
<p>I think I have a pretty I think we all have very good intuition. But I have developed a really good intuition when I was a kid cuz I had a pretty chaotic upbringing. I had very wonderful parents. Well, one my stepmom was bipolar and my mom later on in life became an alcoholic. And so it kind of it made me really good at feeling things.</p>
<p>And so I&#x27;m a sales Yeah. and I&#x27;m a sales director, which means I got really good at sales cuz you kind of feel the the energy, you know. Um the more I&#x27;ve leaned into the intuitive side, what I kind of call it is like it&#x27;s a tug. I feel like a tug in some kind of direction. And there&#x27;s other ways too.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like a quick little glimpse in your stomach, like they say, a gut feeling. Mhm. How could you define what intuition feels like? Well, it feels different to everybody. It depends on how you interpret it. Now, you can get it just as straightforward as listening to a voice.</p>
<p>You can get it as written text. You can get it as a picture. You can you can get it in all kinds of ways. One of the typical ways is is like you do with feelings. You feel a tug to do this.</p>
<p>And you&#x27;ve learned to pay attention to those tugs. When you get that tug, you start to you don&#x27;t dismiss it and say, &quot;Ah, you know, that doesn&#x27;t mean anything.&quot; You start to pay attention to it. And then over time, you start to learn when it feels this way, then I can really trust it. And if it doesn&#x27;t feel that way, I don&#x27;t trust it. And you get better at it.</p>
<p>But the tug you feel is just your interpretation of how you do it. And tugs are, you know, like like Gruntson&#x27;s gestures are to language. You know, tugs are at the very basic level, but you can develop it to where it&#x27;s not at just basic level. You can get it in terms of language and whole thoughts and sentences and feelings and pictures that are very easy to describe. So, everybody has their own way of of interpreting kind of your own language.</p>
<p>Your yours is in the language of tugs. Uh but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. That&#x27;s just what you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve learned. And the information just comes. You have a thought that kind of asks for the information.</p>
<p>You have a wonder. Well, I I wonder how this would work or I wonder what that&#x27;s happening or I wonder this or that. So, you have a little question that comes up. Whether you whether you intellectually know it or not, these questions come up and when they do, that&#x27;s like a query to the database. You&#x27;ll get a response back, an answer to that query.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s how the kids do it. when they give you the cube root of 9,654, they just that&#x27;s a query. They get an answer back and they just read the answer off. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s that sort of thing. So you your your method of reading answers, your language to interpret it is in terms of feelings and tugs and and pushes and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But you can work with that and turn it into other other modes of communicating if you wish. But you&#x27;ve probably refined that tug feeling enough that it&#x27;s probably pretty accurate. You know, it probably works pretty well for you. So, it it is it&#x27;s actually uh when my mom passed away, so she passed away from alcoholism, but it was kind of crazy because it was only a few years ago, the day not the day before, but the the the second to last or maybe even the last time that we actually hung out, I was going to go to this day party. It was just like a thing, a brunch thing.</p>
<p>And I was hanging out with her and then just something kept telling me to stay and just something kept telling me and like and I stayed. I ended up staying and I was with other people and I was like can you wait? Can you wait? And that was an example of when I realized like that feeling was something very very real. Um and it&#x27;s just like this nagging thing. I&#x27;ve had it happen many times. I actually think I&#x27;ve become I mean one of the reasons I&#x27;m talking with you is because I&#x27;ve learned to listen to it and I&#x27;m fascinated by what you your work is because I think it&#x27;s a missing intelligence that so many of us most of us don&#x27;t know how to access or don&#x27;t know that we can and things the work that you&#x27;re doing the work that um Kai and Diane are doing with the telepathy tapes though you the pioneers like you are I think awakening us to remember that that it&#x27;s there, that we should use it, that it&#x27;s for us.</p>
<p>And my small moments of remembering, you know, make me want to learn more. So, um I I would love to, if you&#x27;re open to this, I&#x27;d love to continue this further if you ever want to maybe next time we can talk about um consciousness and AI. I think that would be quite interesting actually if you&#x27;re open to that. But um where just in case, you know, we could do We might even just do a follow-up on this one, but where where do people find your work, Thomas? Well, they can go to the website, which is www.mmy-enbigentoe.com. And if they go there, they will find there links that take them other places.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got probably, I don&#x27;t know, 1,200 videos or so. Very uh daunting number, but uh on YouTube. But I also have a a device for um finding just what you want out of that 1,200 videos. There&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a search tool there. You put in the subject and it will give you links to the precise places out of those thousands of hours of video where you want where you will find what you&#x27;re interested in.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve got a an AI there who um we call AI guy and he speaks in my voice and he&#x27;s very very good. He&#x27;ll give you about 98% of exactly what I would say if you ask me. So you can always ask I AI guy and he will give you about the same thing that I would give you. He&#x27;s been trained on all of my work. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s been fed uh text of all of my videos.</p>
<p>So he he&#x27;s got a a good uh grounding. Wow. With my work. So you can go there. Also, at the website, you&#x27;ll find that if you&#x27;re interested in experiencing paranormal things yourself, then I&#x27;ve got a tool there that will teach you how to do all things paranormal.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s u doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot because I&#x27;m not so much interested in making money as I am in sharing the information. I&#x27;ll be sure to attach your link to all of this and maybe break those a couple of those out actually into individual links so that people can find them just onto on this video. Thank you for the time. Uh you&#x27;re quite welcome. You know, knowledge is a wonderful thing, but shared knowledge is much better.</p>
