            <p>Zero Point Energy I love talking about this subject what&#x27;s your opinion on it I think it&#x27;s reality I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve got it we got that genie in the bottle just yet or if we do they&#x27;re not putting it out because it would put them all out of business and we wouldn&#x27;t have these wars imagine all that energy we spent on all this stuff and all these wars and all these people that die you imagine if this world just United behind something I don&#x27;t think they ever will Zero Point Energy is basically technology that enables energy to be free that means no more utilities no more fossil fuels no more any of that stuff and supposedly Nicola Tesla figured this out a long time ago</p>
