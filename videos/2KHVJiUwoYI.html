            <p>this is the video that you&#x27;ve been waiting for the one aircraft everyone has witnessed from air force to stargazers to historians and aviation buffs triangle in shape this spy plane design seems like something out of a science fiction novel it can perform incredibly high g turns undetectable on radar and was developed from top secret nazi research captured from world war ii and believe it or not it would use an engine system that can only be described as anti-gravity magic prepare yourself for an impossible video on an impossible aircraft the anti-gravity tr-3b black manta [Music] this video could be dubbed deja vu time because it&#x27;s a case of here we go again in fact this video could even have its own theme song namely here we go by swedish group stakabu a fun scar rap tune of the 1990s by the way the lead singer of that song went on to be the director of the award-winning 2019 hbo miniseries chernobyl hey don&#x27;t say i only talk about aviation on this channel okay yep i&#x27;ve dived and dug deep and put together another instance of a mystery plane that the us military refuses to acknowledge and which for all intents and purposes simply doesn&#x27;t exist you know one of those planes the fact that this one is also black and triangle-shaped puts it in the same league as another controversial plane that the us military says doesn&#x27;t exist the aurora that one has its own video here on found and explained so check that out if you like so let&#x27;s turn our attention to the tr3b black manta a triangle-shaped anti-gravity plane around which there has been much speculation like the aurora it deserves some attention so the question that is on your lips what is meant by anti-gravity in the case of the tr-3b black manta it means a craft that uses highly pressurized mercury accelerated by nuclear energy so the plasma is produced which in turn creates a field of anti-gravity around the craft it has an electromagnetic coil at the heart of its motive power system the result of which is electromagnetic drive that interacts with the higgs bison field at the quantum level heaty stuff indeed and definitely something that is probably not common knowledge or even really provable at this point so an anti-gravity aircraft doesn&#x27;t use conventional turbine or rocket engine technology but instead a propulsion system that creates thrust by generating high energy plasma these aircraft are also referred to as flux liners as with many divergent aviation technologies anti-gravity technology dates back to the latter part and aftermath of world war ii and specifically the covert u.s project known as operation paperclip the objective of operation paperclip was for the u.s to gain as much leverage against the soviet union in the military armaments technology race which is why the project was packed to the rafters with german scientists who were avowed members of the nazi party that means the u.s has been investigating anti-gravity technology for nearly 70 years there have also been a slew of confirmed peer-reviewed research studies regarding anti-gravity technology spanning some 60 years conducted and published by respected agencies such as nasa the american institute of physics and the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics as well as the air force research laboratory it is the culmination of theories regarding gravitation quantum gravity and general relativity the latter is first put forward by albert einstein himself anti-gravity is of such huge interest to the military and scientists alike given that for example one could hypothetically reduce an aircraft&#x27;s mass by using electromagnetic propulsion even down to zero little wonder that the likes of nasa the us air force and lockheed martin researchers have all invested in theoretical studies regarding the ability to alter inert mass according to experts the tr-3b black manta would use conventional thrusters located on the tips of the aircraft that would allow it to perform a dizzling number of rapid high speed maneuvers including perfect right angle turns and hyper acceleration it could even achieve this along all three axes as well remember the tr-3b was designed to be a subsonic stealth spy plane for one thing it&#x27;s a very silent aircraft save for a slight humming noise an interesting byproduct of the plasma the tr-3b generates is that it significantly reduces the aircraft&#x27;s radar signature thereby making it ideal for missions in which stealth is paramount this means that the tr-3b black manta could sneak into just about any airspace of any country and not be detected by its air traffic control or air defense systems this little black number has been associated with a number of reports of sightings of flying triangle aircraft over the antelope valley an area of desert in southern california much beloved by ufo watches it&#x27;s also this desert area of california that draws people interested in covet black projects or black op military projects given its close proximity to several known military research and testing areas including edwards air force base and u.s air force plant 42 the latter of which is a mere 60 miles or 97 kilometers from downtown los angeles in my humble opinion the united states air force must thank its lucky stars for ufo enthusiasts and believers of alien spacecraft after all as popular mechanics has written a number of reports of so-called black triangle ufos have probably been secret military aircraft in reality the tr-3b black manta could certainly be the type of black ops project typical of the us air force and navy the u2 spy plane of the 1950s the sr-71 jet of the 1980s and the present-day f-117a stealthcraft are just three examples of planes that the u.s air force denied existed for years all of which were first convertedly developed in nevada&#x27;s infamous area 51 base and let&#x27;s not forget that area 51 itself was only finally acknowledged by the us government when its most covert agency the cia did so on june 2013 courtesy of their freedom of information act requests filed eight years earlier so what about this proof allegations have swirled around the tr-3b black manta for years the bat as the tr-3b is sometimes affectionately known by black ops aviation researchers is hardly new in the covert sighting stakes steve douglas claims that he first captured the ultra secret aircraft on video in 1994. douglas had been used to tracking the likes of the once secret f-117 stealth fighters but this new aircraft was shaped differently and had a different sound crackling over his military-grade radio scanner douglas had witnessed this strange aircraft at the white sands missile range in southern new mexico which is where the first atomic bomb was tested in july 1945 which makes it the perfect place to experiment with nuclear technologies speaking of 1994 there&#x27;s also the strange event at boscom down airfield in wutsushi england that happened on september 26th of that year first reported in the uk&#x27;s air force&#x27;s monthly magazine it was alleged that a unidentified small twin tail stealth fighter crashed at the airfield at 11 pm that day allegations persist to this day that is possibly the tr-3b black manta had crashed there on that night in wiltershire a meal six miles or 9.5 kilometers from stone edge itself not surprisingly the covert event was ferociously denied by the us and uk governments alike it&#x27;s also been alleged that the aircraft was used in the gulf war to provide laser designation for lockheed f-117 nighthawk bombers which would enable the use of laser-guided bombs the u.s air force of course flat out refutes this claim and a counter argument is that the black triangle planes such as the tr-3a have merely been confused with other less dramatic aircraft for example a geoscientist ben mcgee identified some black triangle craft as being border patrol drones fitted with infrared anti-collision or identification lights however the las vegas-based national institute of discovery science or nids has catalogued a number of black triangle plane sightings over a number of years and released a report in which it states that the sightings of the so-called flying triangles had intensified in the period of 1990 to 2004. it concluded that these multiple sightings were not keeping with previous covert operations by the department of defense for example they were often deployed over densely populated areas and highways the institute basically didn&#x27;t know what to make of these sightings further triangle aircraft akin to the tr-3b black manta have been cited since then including one caught on camera by the texas base loredo paranormal research society in july 2012 as well as triangle ufo looking aircraft filmed hovering over north east pennsylvania in late 2018 but what if i told you that someone had taken out a patent on this aircraft design that&#x27;s right officially in writing we now turn to the series of patents issued by the united states patent office or uspo to the united states navy collectively known as the us anti-gravity patents these were patents given to the navy for what look like a triangle-shaped aircraft akin to a ufo alien craft of law the alleged inventor of the patents is an elusive man known as salvador caesar powers an american aerospace engineer and inventor who now works for the us air force his 1999 phd thesis at case western reserve university was titled bubble generation under reduced gravity conditions for both coflow and cross flow configurations so pace clearly had a background in gravity-related research one of the patents that he ended up lodging for the u.s navy was issued on december 4th 2018 and was titled craft using an inertia mass reduction device like so many mysterious patents it actually makes for a delicious reading for example it&#x27;s abstract stating that the patent is for the following a craft using an inertia mass reduction device comprised of an inner resident cavity wall an outer resident cavity and microwave emitters the electrically charged outer resident cavity wall and the electrically insulated inner resident cavity wall forms a resident cavity the microwave emitters create high frequency electromagnetic waves through the resident cavity causing the resident cavity to vibrate in an accelerated mode and create a local polarized vacuum outside of the outer resident cavity wall the patent essentially describes an anti-gravity aircraft and its diagrams as attached clearly show a sharp looking triangle-shaped craft looks uncannily like the archetypical ufo the opening description relating to the craft&#x27;s energy propulsion system is equally fascinating as quoted verbatim here there are four known fundamental forces which control matter and therefore control energy the four known forces are the strong nuclear forces weak nuclear forces electromagnetic force and gravitational force in this hierarchy of forces the electromagnetic force is perfectly positioned to be able to manipulate the other three a stationary electric charge gives rise to an electric field while a moving charge generates both an electric and magnetic field hence the electromagnetic field the patent further reads like an astrophysicist&#x27;s fever dream mentioning things like quantum field theory hyper frequency graduational and hyper frequency vibrational electrodynamics the casimir effect the lamb shift and spontaneous emission to name only but a few so you&#x27;re probably wondering does any of this even exist there are of course the inevitable allegations that the tr-3b was built by the military using extraterrestrial reverse engineer technology even forbes magazine moved in 2021 that maybe just maybe the patents issued to salvador caesar pays could be a cover for alien technology captured over the years by the us military but of course that leap of judgement i think is best reserved for a different youtube channel that is a little bit more out there so what of the tr-3b black manta how far back does it go if at all does it have anything to do with those aforementioned 2018 patents issued to the us navy is it a plane is it a bird could it even be superman well i think it&#x27;s just the united states air force messing with our heads yet again some things will never change you should totally go right now and check out the found and explain website if you jump on there today there are a whole bunch of quiz and other things that you can check out all involved about all of our videos here at found and explained i also want to give a very special thank you to my patreons without the support of these fine fellows and ladies i wouldn&#x27;t be able to do the videos that you see here today and if you would like to join patreon you can see videos early give your own suggestions of topics to cover and speak directly with me through our private discord thank you again so much for watching and perhaps maybe the truth really is out there</p>
