            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Room 517, a bathtub, blood in the water, and a [music] journalist who told his friends, &quot;If anything happens to me, it&#x27;s not an accident. [music] I&#x27;m talking about Danny Castillaro, found dead on August 10th, 1991 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.&quot; The official ruling, suicide, the story he was chasing, he called it the octopus. Spies, contractors, organized crime, each tentacle pulling on the others. So, what was Dany really on to? At the center was Promise, Prosecutor&#x27;s Management Information System. [music] Software built by Insaw Inc.</p>
<p>on Dany believed it was stolen by the Department of Justice, [music] modified with a secret back door, then sold worldwide so US intelligence could watch foreign [music] governments in real time. But that was just one tentacle. Iran Contra arms and [music] drug routes. CIA covert ops in Latin America. BCCI, one of the most corrupt banks in history, moving dirty money.</p>
<p>A California reservation, Kabazon, quietly linked to weapons testing and biotech experiments and other reporters like Bill McCoy who were [music] digging in the same dirt and ended up dead. Dy&#x27;s notes, dozens of interviews, timelines, names read like a wireframe of a shadow government. There&#x27;s Michael Rickono, a tech savant who said [music] he added the back door to promise for the CIA and warned Dany days before he died. William Hamilton at Inslaw, fighting the DOJ over theft. Robert Booth Nichols, [music] arms deals, organized crime, the underworld switchboard.</p>
<p>Dany went to West Virginia to meet a source [music] who promised to hand him the last piece. He never came back. The death scene, officially a suicide, but his wrists were slashed. a dozen times, more than most suicide [music] cases, sedatives in his system, his briefcase and notes missing. A maid reportedly [music] saw bloody towels before police arrived.</p>
<p>No defensive wounds, but too [music] many unanswered questions. His family and friends rejected the ruling. They said he was upbeat, energized, ready to publish. [music] His brother, Dr. Tony Castillaro, put it bluntly.</p>
<p>Dany was murdered. [music] He was getting too close. What backs any of this up? A 1993 House Judiciary [music] Committee report that found credible evidence of promise theft and a cover up. Rico Nashuto&#x27;s sworn affidavit [music] about weaponizing promise for espionage. Books like The Octopus by Ken Thomas and Jim Keith, The Last Circle by Sher Seymour, and Danny&#x27;s [music] own surviving notes rescued by friends and journalists mapping a chilling network.</p>
<p>Even today, FOIA requests hit walls. Files [music] stay classified. Here&#x27;s the legacy that keeps me up at night. Danny&#x27;s octopus [music] predicted our world. Surveillance, capitalism, privatized intelligence, public power [music] outsourced to private hands, oversight eroded one contract at a time.</p>
<p>Whether you believe the octopus is real or not, the pattern is. Follow the software, follow the contracts, follow who watches, and who cashes in. Room 517 wasn&#x27;t just a crime scene. It was a warning. And warnings [music] don&#x27;t expire.</p>
