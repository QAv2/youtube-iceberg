            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>we&#x27;ve obtained a copy of a letter written in 2009 by Senator Harry Reid sent to high-ranking official at the Department of Defense Senator Reid has told us we can go ahead and talk about this can you tell me why that letter is important or can you comment at all so it depends what letter you&#x27;re referring to I&#x27;m sure there were a lot of letters the one if if you&#x27;re referring to is an unclassified presuming it&#x27;s an unclassified letter okay that way yes I have read that letter I think that letter portrays a very compelling picture to the Department of Defense that the preliminary results of the 8th program were were warranting an increase in the protection of that information ie that the results were coming in and the preliminary results were such that we need to take extra precaution protecting this information and the results because the the data was very compelling it was very very legitimate it sort of responds to some of the criticisms that have come toward T TSA toward the UFO subject in general it basically outlines at this program a tip and the and the bath study were successful they they zeroed in on a lot of usable useful information absolutely was successful it was absolutely successful that is undeniable to the point where that point was raised to senior levels of the Department of Defense in the US government I think you know what I think when we&#x27;re looking at this this topic it&#x27;s important that we there&#x27;s a lot of things that T TSA is working on at any given time just because we&#x27;re not public about it doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re not doing anything about it as you recall first of all there were two videos that came out New York Times by the way got those independently not for me and everybody said oh you got two videos that&#x27;s great and then nothing ot TSA it&#x27;s got nothing else then all of a sudden another video gets released people whoa okay maybe they had something another got nothing else it&#x27;s you know been a couple months three videos that&#x27;s it people that don&#x27;t understand and I wish we could communicate to to the audience that we are working a lot of things back to you that are trying to help drive this conversation and take it from the fringe and and that relegated to to kind of weird stigma type conversations and bring it not only to the mainstream where but where you can have this conversation over a dinner table with your family and and not feel strange or freaking people out because in the end what may be considered quote unquote supernatural in the end may very well be just a natural part of a world right so I would I would submit to you that probably the cell phone that I used to call my family my wife thirty years ago was considered supernatural by many and now it&#x27;s just natural in fact pretty much anything by definition is supernatural until it becomes natural right so I think hopefully we can help drive that conversation and and remove some of the stigma you know I I&#x27;m sorry to say but I let me put this out from a DoD perspective years ago it was taboo taboo to even mention gays in the military right oh we can&#x27;t do this to bridge that&#x27;s too too far of a bridge for us to cross we&#x27;re not gonna get those two politically charged and now here we are in modern day and nobody has a conversation because it&#x27;s normal routine there&#x27;s no stigma yes you can have gays in the military who cares we still are the best military force in the world right nothing has changed but it took unfortunately a very very long time for the gay community to get rid of that stigma so we could have the conversation at the highest levels of government and realize our policies were flawed right and I think this is very much the same way now someone&#x27;s gonna come in and they&#x27;re gonna say well you can&#x27;t compare what you&#x27;re doing to you know gays in the military well I&#x27;m not necessarily making a direct correlation I&#x27;m just simply using it as an analogy that there have been historically topics that had been taboo that been proverbially radioactive in the Department of Defense and all of a sudden now we realized looking back 20 years well that was silly why did we even care so what it&#x27;s part of reality and I think this is very much the same way this is a conversation that hopefully in 10-15 years 20 years we will look back as a nation and say wow we really hindered ourselves by making this topic taboo when we didn&#x27;t have to well T TSA has done a lot to move that ball down the field to have the national conversation there&#x27;s you on Tucker Carlson and then another night is is is Chris Mellon and CNN and all these all this kind of attention that I&#x27;m sure you never wanted to have no I can assure you it&#x27;s an amazing thing I&#x27;m it&#x27;s an amazing transformation you have critics saying oh gosh you know we want it all we want it now it can&#x27;t be fast enough right but it has the the progress that&#x27;s been made in eight months is remarkable yes a little scary I I wouldn&#x27;t have expected it to go this far this fast I think we need to make sure that as it&#x27;s a bit like riding away fright you don&#x27;t want to get get caught flat-footed and get behind the wave so we need to make sure that every action this company takes is deliberate and it&#x27;s planned even though it may not necessarily always be public there are things this company is doing behind the scenes that I think I&#x27;m not sure any other company has been able to do yet now with that said this company I can tell you as a matter of fact would not have been able to do what it is doing now and today if it wasn&#x27;t for some of the hard work that other companies were doing in the past and weren&#x27;t getting any the credit for like a Bigelow Aerospace and some other companies who were busy working behind the scenes busy making things happen collecting data conducting the analysis and yet nobody had a clue that was going on and I don&#x27;t think we T TSA would have been able to do that I know we wouldn&#x27;t been able to do that if it wasn&#x27;t for the hard work of these men and these other organizations and even within the US government too so I want to make sure it&#x27;s clear that the US government is not our enemy the US government is our friend but sometimes when you have a really big friend that&#x27;s got a lot of complicated moving pieces inside sometimes you kind of need to hold their hand and help them walk through things right</p>
