            <p>let&#x27;s do this then let us let us go to mr william alec who has been patiently waiting hi tim okay bill yeah are you ready take it away man take it away i do not have an introduction okay share screen okay um thank you for presenting bill i think wayne will probably be here in a while that&#x27;s okay we can push him back a little bit okay i assume everyone can see this screen yep you you look great yeah oh perfect perfect okay okay well let&#x27;s get started here um basically this is the culmination of um almost all my work here you know i got into the field here back in 97 i went to a conference tom bearden was presenting um he&#x27;s probably at that time the probably the most authoritative presenter on the subject and he always spoke about scalar waves and that was always a mystery to hear what what is all the scalar wave stuff you know he&#x27;s presenting here and so really my this really started my journey you know in this area and so let&#x27;s get right to it here okay okay what is a scalar wave okay tom describes a scalar wave or he called he also called it a pump wave as a local gravitational wave he describes matter as being trapped electromagnetic energy well guess what that&#x27;s true okay and i can show you in the quantum wave theory that what tom spoke about that matter electrons protons it&#x27;s all trapped electromagnetic energy but it&#x27;s set up as a counter rotating waves they&#x27;re trapped waves that form a particle and you have this scalar component associated with it that&#x27;s this what tom referred to as this local gravitational wave okay so let&#x27;s get into more detail here to produce a scalar wave tom speaks about in in his lectures and his lectures are posted on freely on the internet where he goes into this kind of detail here and it&#x27;s the cross product of two charges well we know when we try to force two charges together you have to overcome what&#x27;s called the coulomb barrier to get what&#x27;s called fusion right so you get into this opposing vector and this also gets into this law of squares and i know uh the serial technology talks about this as well and there&#x27;s also a movie that came out i believe was last year called tenet where it gets into time forward and time reversed properties here as well so you have this law of squares occurring with this phenomena of q cross q okay so it in this technology to see the scalar wave term appear you need to operate your device in resonance destiny operated in residence otherwise you don&#x27;t really see this property occurring okay okay so here&#x27;s a picture of my test bench and this test bench can consist of a sine wave generator it&#x27;s programmable sine wave generator here this particular one here is made by gw instead and the scope that i&#x27;m using and you want to use a scope like this because it&#x27;s an isolated channel uh four channel scope and what i mean here is that each channels uh is physically isolated from from its its uh its its next channel here in other words there&#x27;s no grounding uh between the channels so you need to use an isolated channel scope what you see here is the transformer okay that sets up this opposing field action okay and there&#x27;s two amp probes and i measure the voltage and so the amperage is converted into a voltage and that&#x27;s what you see on the scope here and you can see on that scope a very strange width uh wave pattern um which you also see here is um sine waves but this very strange blue trace up here has the scalar wave function that tom spoke about okay now to get this to appear you set up this transformer in resonance which means that the output of the transformer is connected to a capacitor okay so that your voltage and current will be at a phase difference of 90 degrees okay and then up here i wrote some software that basically reads the scope values and does some calculations and i&#x27;ll show you what those calculations are because they compute all the uh well it not only displays voltage and current rms values but it also calculates what the phase differences are between the input and output um uh the reactive components you know basically everything you need the most worthless calculation it does is probably power factor you know you don&#x27;t really need that at all but anyway it figures out what the real power is okay but in when you&#x27;re operating resonance in this type of mode there is no real power associated it&#x27;s all reactive okay so let&#x27;s uh go on to the next slide here okay so how to make a scalar wave now tom said in his lectures any competent lab could do this but i but when i asked him i think right back around 2001 i asked you know how how did he do this he turned to me and looked me straight in the eye and said don&#x27;t you ever ask me that again and it&#x27;s like whoa okay okay tom so it took me 20 years to figure this out uh but anyway i figured out what he was talking about okay so again you know we&#x27;re looking at q cross q and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the whole fundamental part of this scalar function okay and so what you have are opposing vectors of charges in this situation and of course tom always said matter is made of trapped electromagnetic energy and again i&#x27;ll tell you that&#x27;s absolutely true okay that shows up in the quantum field theory okay so let&#x27;s continue here how to determine resonance okay well here&#x27;s the output of the transformer shown on the left and the configuration is that it&#x27;s set up as a bifiler like coil output arrangement and you&#x27;ll notice the output capacitor here and then of course later on i attach a load okay to this output and so uh what the transformer is doing is setting up opposing forces inside your magnetic material okay then tom also refers to this as like we&#x27;re operating in this non-linear type mode here okay so we&#x27;re producing an opposing magnetic magnetic motor forces and so it&#x27;s going to produce a scalar function now the diagram on the right where resonance occurs at minimum input current so we have a resonant action here and i tuned the output of the programmable power supply to this minimum input current that that we see here coming into and powering the device so we tune the device uh with minimum input current where where it&#x27;s at resonance okay that&#x27;s how you do this so here&#x27;s a picture of the of the transformer and capacitor arrangement here and how it&#x27;s connected and you see here towards the rear of this transformer is where we set up these opposing magnetic forces in this case so the input side of this coil you see on the left side this is where we connect this to our programmable power supply the output is connected this way and it said it&#x27;s set up in such that the voltages on the output sum they sum up but the magnetic components okay we have them converging okay to set up our opposing field action and we set this up in this resonance mode here so next slide now tom also got into what are called pcms which are phase conjugated mirrors and i i&#x27;m still trying to wrap my brain around this so personally i don&#x27;t have a clear understanding what&#x27;s going on here but anyway we he sets up this pump wave action okay on your input side into this pcm it causes a non-linear medium and it outputs a time reverse wave and so this is where we get into this time reversed action and this is uh quite popular with the optics and also i believe with sound as well uh doing this uh time reversed outputs setting up these uh replica time reversed waves now what what i think is going on in here is that the reactive component that you&#x27;re seeing in that blue trace is of course the scalar wave it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s occurring in this magnetic material that is feeding out or reactive uh towards the output of this transformer and that&#x27;s what we see on the scale on the scope so the input is inputting a current and the transformer is sending back a reactive component which is the scalar wave component and the two um currents they add and that&#x27;s that complex wave pattern with the three ohms and we&#x27;ll get into that a little later here in terms of the detail okay so this is a little bit more on the pcm wave function tom frequently spoke about this okay so examples of these pcm resonators includes tesla&#x27;s magnifying transformer and this is what i saw in his patents is that tesla was really transmitting uh scalar waves you know in his output uh the floyd sweep device the sqm is a space space quantum modulator device i set up opposing fields uh stanley myers water car that also used opposing field action just you can see that in its patents uh the beard meg device another opposing field action okay in my transformer uh the same phenomena and in meta-material resonators okay you want to set up this opposing field action and this is what i think was really behind the hutchison effect okay um when he levitated uh these various heavy objects you know like that 90 pound cannonball uh doing his disruptive uh experiments on materials um i believe he was using various types of phasing okay and this opposing field action using radio waves okay okay the physics of scalar waves let&#x27;s get into that all right i was watching a youtube video a few weeks ago and lo and behold i saw it okay there&#x27;s a scalar wave function inside uh of this quantum field theory and then here it is particles with mass you&#x27;ll see this function here of 2 pi f min squared that is your scalar wave term and i was stunned when i saw that and it&#x27;s for all particles with mass massless particles you know such as photons there is no mass with it so that term is zero but this term with the scalar wave term in it squared okay this frequency can be two sine waves okay a particle can contain two counter rotating electromagnetic wave functions there it is okay counter rotating wave functions producing the scalar wave term okay okay the mathematics to this you will not find this in any textbook um in regards to um uh you know the uh the maxwell equations which heavyside minimized and of course tom went to some detail about this and this is really the failure of modern science because what heavyside did is that he took out the scalar component okay in the original quaternion mass solution of maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetics but if you work with the original maxwell electromagnetics there is there&#x27;s your scalar component and really this is all that you need you don&#x27;t really need einstein&#x27;s general relativity you can supposedly do it with this quaternion math solution here because you have the scalar wave function that&#x27;s part of this and to get access to it is where you set up the supposing wave action okay and so what that does is that when you do that this is the posing wave action in ordinary uh the reduced maxwell equations you see that you have a zero vector and that&#x27;s it game over at that point this is why you cannot mix electromagnetics with general relativity it doesn&#x27;t work okay because of this zero vector issue here and no scalar function but when you work with the quaternion mass solution this is what tom showed in his lectures it&#x27;s right there is that you have this scalar wave component the a squared term plus the zero vector and he called the zero vector this vacuum engine that&#x27;s behind this and behind the vacuum engine is the scalar wave function now if we&#x27;re using sine&#x27;s sine waves as our input which we are doing okay with that sine wave generator on my test bench you get the scalar wave term which is a sine squared term and so that&#x27;s why when i saw this the sine squared term is where i went back up to this video and you can view look at this video this is a slide right off right off that video is where you have the scalar wave component there it is f meant squared so built into particles with mass you said that you had the scalar wave term so it&#x27;s true what tom bearden said all that electrons protons all that they&#x27;re doing are counter rotating electromagnetic fields that are trapped in that make up a particle okay so here&#x27;s the basic theory behind it where you have the a squared term times the sine squared term you have to have sine squared which is the scalar component okay the scalar wave inside the zero vector vacuum engine and so tom referred to the scalar wave pump wave okay is a local gravitational wave okay that&#x27;s what he called that in his lectures that&#x27;s that&#x27;s your gravity okay so what does this look like okay well i modeled this and i i have an old version i&#x27;m still running windows xp because i still have the old software it&#x27;s all that i can afford okay but it&#x27;s great for modeling so the top waveform is what we&#x27;re working with okay the top waveform is what the sine wave generator produces and so the transformer the reactive component of this transformer is producing this scalar to sine squared term and so when i modeled that this is what what a gravity wave actually looks like okay it&#x27;s this sine wave but the dc offset so when you model this mathematically you&#x27;ll see a waveform like this and then when you add the two together okay the input current plus the reflective reactive uh scalar wave component from the transformer you add the two you get a waveform that looks like uh this bottom trace and so lo and behold that&#x27;s exactly what we see here on this scope trace here okay that blue trace on the scope is your scalar wave plus the current okay the ac current coming from the power supply so let&#x27;s go back up here um okay so that&#x27;s what we see here in this third wave pattern is the summation of the input plus the scalar waveform and this is the actual scope reading here the blue trace is your input current sine wave plus the sine squared term okay okay and then going back to the test bench here kind of puts it all together the software plus what we see on the tektronix scope the power supplied here transformer with the capacitor arrangement okay so how do we determine all these phase angles and phase shifting that&#x27;s going on here because it it&#x27;s got to be a hell of a thing to do for this tektronix scope is trying to figure out what the phase angle of this stuff um trying to calculate all this okay and so this is uh this is our device under test here our dot okay where we feed our input signal output is our uh resistive load plus uh the capacitor uh which isn&#x27;t shown here but normally this is where we put our capacitor uh for this resonator but anyway this shows you the calculations that are involved you know figuring out what the cosine is uh reactive power apparent power real power you know just it figures all this stuff out for you okay and ultimately you want to end up with knowing what the efficiency of your system is okay so this is an actual output this is a latest version of my software you can actually go to my website and download this okay you can download this for free it mainly works with only this particular scope uh this type of arrangement here and you know i work with uh the tektronix amp probes you know basically everything there is off the shelf okay um and so we see here uh what the apparent power is with the phase shift the input phase shift the output phase shift uh in this case it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s resonating at a frequency of 400 400 hertz and we see that we have um uh two different two different i calculate two different transformer efficiencies here because i want to make sure i&#x27;m close as possible to being on the mark okay so in this case i have a load of uh 9.4 ohms on that transformer and i see i have this efficiency of 9 of 90 89 90 and it&#x27;s unusually high okay for for a transformer because transformers um when you don&#x27;t operate them in this particular mode here just operate as an ordinary transformer they&#x27;re generally between uh 75 80 percent maybe 85 tops you know but here we see a higher efficiency and so i think that&#x27;s due to the scalar component that we see coming from this transformer so tom frequently spoke about free energy okay with these type of systems and i think we&#x27;re seeing it here because there&#x27;s this added force that we&#x27;re seeing in this circuit it&#x27;s not just the normal electromagnetic forces but we&#x27;re seeing this scalar or this gravitational force that&#x27;s also showing up in here as well and that&#x27;s what i think tom means by you know this free energy okay is that we&#x27;re seeing it as an increase in efficiency of of this particular transformer okay so what what am i doing here okay um the software is performing all these types of calculations so it&#x27;s looking at apparent power you know it&#x27;s reading voltages and currents and so um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s gonna do the apparent input power uh the real input power calculation and watts it&#x27;s going to do all these type of calculations here compute what the phase angle is and that&#x27;s a little mathematical operation here involving arc cosine computing the apparent power uh on the output and it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really computing all these uh probably the most worthless the most worthless output is power factor you know what do you need that for right so anyway um uh we end up figuring out what the uh what the efficiency of this transformer is and so i look at the phase calculations in regards to computing the efficiency as well as um the voltage and resistance uh and computing the um uh the real power that way and that&#x27;s why i displayed the two and they&#x27;re it&#x27;s less than a percent difference of 89 university 90 but nevertheless you know we&#x27;re seeing this excess energy in these transformers okay so this is uh some real outputs um coming from the device here and i&#x27;m mainly looking at the apparent power multiplier and this this type of transformer it just has this extraordinary um reactive power that comes out of this and and i&#x27;m seeing values as high as uh almost 11 times you know if you look at just voltage and amps okay you don&#x27;t really look at the uh the phase shifting that&#x27;s going on here even though the phase shifting is tell you is telling you that it&#x27;s 90 degrees 89.9 it&#x27;s practically 90 degree phase shift okay with the capacitor you know we see that we have these extraordinary um voltage and amp outputs okay and then as you start to increase your load okay where it starts to impact the phase difference okay but anyway you know i&#x27;m looking at uh mainly frequency and i&#x27;m adjusting the frequency here and looking at this uh apparent power uh on the output here okay so if we go back to the bible here one of my favorites is luke 12 2. we&#x27;re in a great revealing now i feel okay where all will be known okay that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening now okay and all this research we&#x27;re reviewing the truth here you know what&#x27;s coming out the great revealing and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing you know with this type of technology okay so now we get into a very interesting area in regards to tom&#x27;s military applications revealed okay and tops tom spoke quite a bit about militarizing scalar wave technology and in particular scalar wave interferometry okay for defense type applications and to do that you need two ground-based scalar wave emitters okay and what this does is that where the beams cross okay you have one scalar emitter over here another scalar emitter over here embedding waves scalar wave beams and where the beams cross that little region creates strong electromagnetic field energy and i always wondered what he meant by that and it didn&#x27;t really come out until i started looking at the mathematics behind this because in that region it can destroy electronics anything that enters that region okay in a powerful scalar wave beams anything that enters that region yeah you can have strong electromagnetic energy okay so let&#x27;s get into that okay so we have scalar wave interferometry and so this is what tom spoke about years ago and so we have scalar wave one scalar wave uh one 1a and 1b you can have destructive interference or you can set up a virtual ground okay that&#x27;s set up in that region or just by changing the phase of those waves okay you can have strong electromagnetic ac okay very interesting and so this could be what&#x27;s behind the hutcheson effect is that you know he&#x27;s using tesla scalar waves to set up these type of interference patterns that could be very destructive okay and so here&#x27;s a diagram that shows a scalar wave interferometry anything that would enter that region you can either set up a virtual ground or a strong ac potential okay in that region and that&#x27;s what happens when you mix uh scalar waves now the question is are the russians doing this well it&#x27;s quite possible you know they could have their technology here and i&#x27;ve heard of warships that all of a sudden lose their electromagnetics okay the whole warship goes dead okay and so there could be some scalar wave interferometry going on here used as a weapon okay so that&#x27;s pretty much the end of my lecture there um all my stuff is published a lot of my stuff is published at academia.edu just look up under my name there you can find a lot of this material and that is my presentation so you can look up uh intellect.com is where uh the latest research is on replicating tom bearden&#x27;s technology scalar waves bill thank you sir thank you 352 almost so we&#x27;re almost there for wayne too we&#x27;re almost on schedule uh so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do this though before anything else again everybody oops side by side speaker bill i&#x27;m gonna stop your sharing perfect okay i&#x27;m gonna put this thing on gallery boot everyone please give mr bill alec a giant hand thank you and i know that&#x27;s kind of an update of a previous presentation you did so thank you for sharing that with us sir um yeah and and thank you for your patience and scheduling also you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s feast or famine around here man it&#x27;s like oh i know the feeling two months two months ago i was begging i was like please share something with us you know and then this month i&#x27;ve got people booked out two sessions so you know but but um it&#x27;s a good feeling um so let&#x27;s do this again</p>
