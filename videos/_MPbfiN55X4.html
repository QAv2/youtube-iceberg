            <p>I just want to quickly talk about quaternions because it&#x27;s something that I used to struggle with a lot I understood that they&#x27;re there to stop gimbal locking and they&#x27;re there to make sure your rotations work between 360 degrees and zero it made sense to me but the problem is how to actually operate them didn&#x27;t make sense to me now I&#x27;m not going to talk about the complex part of quaternions and how to understand that ijks and all of that but what I will talk about is how to visualize rotations so that they don&#x27;t confuse you anymore so to start I&#x27;m going to talk about vectors vectors people think of them sometimes as positions but a vector only has a Direction think of a position in unity for instance there&#x27;s some then there&#x27;s like X Y and Z right the vector itself is just the line from the origin to that point a vector itself never has a position it just has a direction and it says okay I&#x27;m here to get to here I have to go through this motion and and then you can get back again to the start by doing the opposite so if my Vector is three two one in X Y and Z right then to get back to zero I do minus three minus two minus one and that first Vector shows me how to get to the position three two and then one and this other one shows me how to get back the three back the two and back the one but I can also in its own right this is a vector of its own and that shows how to go minus three minus two minus one and if you add it to this Vector the inverse as we can say of that Vector is this Vector we go back three two one again right and those will get us back to neutral so an inverse is the position that gets you back to your origin now in quaternions instead of the origin zero zero zero what you instead have is the identity quaternion so the vector zero zero zero shows you how to get from zero to zero it shows you how to get from the origin back to the origin whereas in quaternions the identity showed you how to get from the origin to the origin if you multiply a quaternity an identity by itself you end up at the origin again but instead of thinking about quaternions like positions instead think of them like a Rubik&#x27;s cube right we&#x27;ll just look at the middle layer your game object it only rotates this way this way and this way it doesn&#x27;t rotate in like one two three like a Rubik&#x27;s Cube so we&#x27;ll just look at the middle now I can say that this is currently at the identity and then if I were to rotate it this direction once right I can get to this state this is like my Vector right this is the quaternion that shows how to get from origin to this point but much like I can translate in X then y then Zed and make one vector together I can rotate in X then y then Z and this new thing is a quaternion that shows one 90 degree rotation X then a y then a z which would actually multiply out as Z times y times at because you multiply your latest rotation on the left side now if we want to get back from this position to the origin again to the identity we take the inverse of this quaternion the thing with vectors is vectors are commutative which means I can go in X and then y or I can go in y then X and the arrow that I make the hypotenuse of this triangle will be the exact same Vector either way around whereas that&#x27;s not true for rotations if I rotate in X and then y I&#x27;ll get a completely different result so if I rotating y then X so this is the Y and we&#x27;ll call this one the Z if I rotate y then Z you see we get this green on the left orange here then we rotate back now this time I&#x27;ll rotate in Z then y AI you see now this green has the Red Dot in that so we&#x27;ve got a different result for rotating in different ways so you have to get your rotations in the right order but the other thing is if this is the rotation to turn something 90 degrees anti-clockwise in y then the inverse of this quaternion is 90 degrees clockwise and Y so this right the inverse of this is this but you can also just Express the inverse on its own like this this is the inverse because if you multiply this Rubik&#x27;s Cube by this Rubik&#x27;s Cube you get this Rubik&#x27;s Cube which is the identity and if you inverse the identity you get itself because this is already at its base state right and you can do this with multiple steps so if we go this then this the inverse of this craternion is this then this right which is this you see so this thing is an inverse itself and then there&#x27;s this that&#x27;s the inverse of the inverse which brings us back so we just redid the original quaternion on this quaternion and that&#x27;s just how to think of quaternions the other thing to think of when you&#x27;re thinking of rotations is if you think about X Y and Z some people can&#x27;t visualize which way an X rotation is and X rotation means you stick a spear through the x-axis and you rotate around it like a shish kebab so for instance if we&#x27;re saying this way out of blue is the X Direction then that means the X rotation is this way right but zad was saying that Zed comes out of the white okay outwards from Y is the Z Direction well then this way is z rotation and likewise Y is spared through the middle right Y is up and down well then this is the Y rotation and the other thing is you can use a quaternion on a vector so if I have some series of points like uh we&#x27;ll draw a little square here and then I have a quaternion that rotates everything left 45 degrees anti-clockwise in the Z Direction now Unity is a left-handed coordinate system which means that Z is anti-clockwise right because because that is forwards if I have a quaternion that rotates my frame 45 degrees anti-clockwise in Z then that means this whole thing is going to become like this or if I want to for instance adjust some things on my transform locally it may be a lot easier to First multiply by the inverse of that thing&#x27;s rotation do all the little maths on it and then multiply it back by the original quaternion again so for instance if we look at this if I have an object here and I want to move this square right relative to it but my object is actually rotated in this plane so I have the square here and I want it to go that way then what I can first do is I have my quaternium that shows how to get there if I multiply everything by the inverse of that quaternion it&#x27;s going to take all of this stuff and rotate it back to the origin so now my square is like that then I can just move it through the x-axis like normal right up to here and then once we&#x27;ve done that we then multiply it through again by its original returning rather than the inverse so it goes back to here and rotates to here so that&#x27;s how you can do maths on things sometimes so for instance look at it this way let&#x27;s say we already have an object that&#x27;s rotated right we call that thing a and a itself has some transformed up position which shows its direction from the origin of the unity scene which is that Vector but now we&#x27;re just going to ignore that and draw around this object we&#x27;re looking at it as local space so then if we look at another object this Cube that&#x27;s over here and we call this object B then we can find where B is relative to a by doing B dot par so you know pulse of B minus plus of a right that gives us this Vector here which is the distance between the toe now if I want to move that object to the right a bit then what I can now do is this Vector here B minus a I can multiply this by the inverse so the quaternion dot inverse of my current rotation so transform.rotation multiply that by this Vector that will give me this thing here square B and it will give me this Vector here which shows it in normal space non-rotated space relative to a right a is local frame basically then I can add a new Vector to this so say plus new Vector 3 2 0 0 that will shift this B over to here right so let&#x27;s give it a new color now we want to put our changes into the real world so we want the square to end up here so what we finally do is we take this entire thing wrap this entire thing in Brackets and say my transform.rotation times all of that whole thing that will give me the vector the fact this new Vector so if I make this orange Vector here which is to the new position the value of this orange Vector equals this entire thing so it&#x27;s position B minus position a which is this blue Vector here then we multiply that by the quaternion dot inverse which rotates it into this Frame here we add this Vector over here which is this little black line here and then finally we rotate by this thing and that rotates it back into this Frame giving us this orange Vector here which is V but yeah the trick is just think of it in terms of Rubik&#x27;s Cube rotation and then everything gets a lot easier that&#x27;s my little tidbit for the day also incidentally that&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t have a graternion out of one vector you have to have a quaternion look rotation which shows first your upper vector and the way you&#x27;re looking at something because I can look at you in that direction but I can also look at you in that direction from all these different rotations so that engine has to know where my up is when I&#x27;m looking at you and that will give us a working quaternion and now we&#x27;re over 10 minutes all right goodbye</p>
