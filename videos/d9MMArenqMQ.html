            <p>it&#x27;s absurd that a flying saucer lands in a in a field some guy gets out in a silver suit and then proceeds to fix it as if it&#x27;s you know a car uh opens a side panel and you know and then gets in and flies off and so it&#x27;s absurd look this is a show this is meant to make you think and realize that it&#x27;s absurd and are you capable of realizing that it&#x27;s not at fa you not what you&#x27;re seeing is not at face value what you&#x27;re seeing is something which is meant to stimulate you to realize what&#x27;s really going on or what might be going on behind the scenes to go back to your experiences you you shared them with Ross card on the interview with him and one of those experiences that you as a kid you you saw entities in your room for a period of days or weeks I&#x27;m not sure if I remember correctly weeks few weeks and they they were there they were real for you that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what you explained those that experience or that that set of experiences that is still fuel for you oh yeah it&#x27;s like I can still see it in my mind you know I you know and so you know look somebody could claim it was some sort of weird dream true why well why did I have that weird dream that other people have had m mhm and relayed the thing and it wasn&#x27;t until literally 20 years later that I came up PR the explanation for what it was even though it had always been in my mind you know from the year 10 on it was never anything that I really ever thought about um and so uh I didn&#x27;t have bad dream but what I did have though is a is a burning need whenever I moved into a new house to put shades on the windows I had a sort of a PTSD about because I did have a memories of something looking in the window at me and so um and actually funny enough uh Diana relays uh an event like that in her book when she and I and um Tyler Taylor yeah she called him went out to that place in um New Mexico where they put me in a room uh we first got you this little kind of bed and breakfast that had no shades on the window and I just had a you know I just had to melt them didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t know that she was there but apparently she was sitting in a little side room when I came out to the front desk and said I can&#x27;t be in this room wow I need a room with shades on it now it&#x27;s just a PTSD and somebody could say just because Gary had bedrooms when he was a kid that&#x27;s it fine maybe that&#x27;s it but um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s those kinds of things that um again it&#x27;s like how do I explain that and how do I turn it into science so that I can have a conversation with with my peers about it so how do you explain that that that particular series of of episodes there when you I that one I just that&#x27;s that&#x27;s actually the the only way I explain that is by explaining all the other things first because it just it&#x27;s just too weird to me it&#x27;s just like I don&#x27;t have an understanding of why things like that would show up in little boy bedrooms sounds creepy to me yeah yes yeah I mean and sure and that of course explains a pdsd um you know as a kid and I don&#x27;t think I was uh any different than anybody else I was always spooked out by being followed up the stairs or followed down uh uh my hallway at night I you know just run right into bed and I wouldn&#x27;t think about things that would creep me out but if I did think about things I did Imagine things I would feel like I would create them and they would appear right or yeah so you said at a conference the salt conference which I thought was curious uh because it was a more an investment s type conference in New York uh but it&#x27;s it felt like the crowd there was very eager to hear about um uh your experiences and your thoughts on this kind of subject and at one point you said you&#x27;re I&#x27;m just going to read it up for a second here you said when the the host asked you what is it what what&#x27;s happening and you said I think that is an advanced form of intelligence something that we don&#x27;t understand that is using some sort of intermediaries that are put here I think you said here as an intelligence test so can you see what&#x27;s in front of you for what it really is right uh and what really is what it really is means what&#x27;s behind it um that the intermediaries in this hypothesis in this speculation are something that um sort of a a minimal viable product of what it is that you can interact with and realize that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not human realize that it is evidence of something that is not you evidence that it is something of a profound something behind the scenes but taking on what Jac Valle would say because I remember reading his books before I&#x27;d ever met him jacqu used uses the word absurd a lot in his discussion of um people&#x27;s experiences and uh things that they&#x27;ve seen and you know example is it&#x27;s absurd that a flying saucer lands in a in a field um some guy gets out in a silver suit and then proceeds to fix it as if it&#x27;s you know a car uh opens a side panel and you know twiddles with it and then gets in and flies off and so it&#x27;s absurd you know it&#x27;s absurd that sometimes the walk up to the door of the farmer and say can I have a glass of water sure you know and so what his interpretation and he&#x27;s just brilliant is look this is a show this is meant to make you think and realize that it&#x27;s absurd and are you capable of realizing that is not at fa you not what you&#x27;re seeing is not at face value what you&#x27;re seeing is something which is meant to stimulate you to realize what&#x27;s really going on or what might be going on behind the scenes another way to look at it is if you&#x27;re a super intelligence that has never interacted with Humanity you know and you have thoughts about things that are so far a field from what a human could ever interpret how many layers of translation do you need to go down right to tell somebody what it is that they&#x27;re seeing and so you&#x27;re going to as best you can fit the narrative to the cultural capabilities of the Observer so which is why the observations change over time right I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an explanation it&#x27;s not actuality but it is you know the only way that I can deal with the disparities in the data you know sort of you that you science has to have a theory when you have a theory it has to explain everything if a single conclusion is out of you know sorts with the data or is contradict obliterates everything it obliterates the theory</p>
