            <p>all right hello everyone I am Thomas welcome to my channel uh I do educational material here on this channel and uh today is the 92nd video on the reciprocal system of theory uh and I think the 70th video on this uh his final book that&#x27;s called beyond space and time and uh we are in chapter 23. called religion re-examined now beyond space and time came out in 1995 Larson died in 1990 and a lot of his uh followers were embarrassed by this book because they didn&#x27;t think that he would as a hard-headed scientist would uh put out something on metaphysics on religion philosophy and psychology where all of his earlier work was on physics and chemistry and astronomy um and I&#x27;m not sure uh where to come down on that but it does look like it&#x27;s uh you know was uh pretty pretty uh completed work and uh why I&#x27;m looking at it is because I think it&#x27;s probably you know his most accessible thing uh at least topically and uh you can get into the system and into his thinking we will be going into the the harder uh scientific stuff a little bit later the gist of Larson&#x27;s theory is it&#x27;s a Theory of Everything um and so you can apply it to any subject once you kind of become fluent with the reciprocal system you can apply it to whatever it is that you um you know have a penchant for and uh it allows you to kind of be free of the uh scientists and the white lab coats um because you can now do it for yourself you don&#x27;t have to trust them you can take the reciprocal system and you know it might take a little while but you can figure out how to apply it to these other subjects uh any subject now the gist of the theory is that the Universe unlike the Greeks the Greeks thought the universe was made out of matter atoms and uh Einstein thought that the Universe was looked like it was made out of atoms but it was really made out of energy by E equals m c squared and Larson came along a little bit later and he said well the mere fact that there&#x27;s equals m c squared and that energy can be converted to matter and vice versa means that neither one of those things can possibly be the fundamental thing of the universe and Larson Moore looked to the c squared part the speed of light squared uh he&#x27;s he said that the universe is made out of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time um and he wasn&#x27;t looking at any uh kind of vectorial motion Larson was looking at a scalar motion it&#x27;s a motion without any direction or with all directions you can Envision this as taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on the balloon and blowing up the balloon um a you know with a magic marker uh and then blowing up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other but not any particular direction that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s really a uh scalar motion uh and it takes three dimensions of vectorial space to really represent one dimension of a scalar motion um and so um now to get to the motion is the relationship between time and space and that really means that space and time are reciprocals of each other uh in the same way that you have a fraction three-fourths and that&#x27;s its reciprocal is four thirds uh they are to get from one to the other you just invert and um so space and time are reciprocals of each other and they uh have the same qualities as each other uh what we know about space it&#x27;s multidimate three-dimensional or more um therefore time is also three-dimensional or more and then time is always progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later so to space is progressing uh things are always getting farther and farther apart and again you can look at the balloon uh for that kind of analogy or are you you know and if you suck in the balloon then you get an inward scalar motion so scalar motion has a direction it&#x27;s either in or out and um uh the Hubble telescope also observed the recession of the distant galaxies uh kind of like that balloon analogy all of the galaxies are moving away from each other that is the progression of space or the flow of space so you have what you know Larson you have coordinate time uh and then you also have coordinate I mean coordinate space and you also have coordinate time you have um the progression of time and you also have the progression of space Larson calls that clock time and clock space um and then space and time are also quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light the speed of light the c squared part again or at least the C of the c squared part is uh the neutral point of the universe unlike Einstein who said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson is saying it&#x27;s the boundary between two different uh kind of co-universes what he calls the material sector which is the slower than the speed of light sector that we&#x27;re familiar with the world of atoms and matter um and physics and chemistry but then there&#x27;s also the Cosmic Universe which he calls sector two this is the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and this has to do with uh well I think all kinds of mental phenomena and um the material Universe builds up uh by aggregation atoms and molecules binding with each other and such like until it gets to its most complex level which is DNA a few billion atoms per molecule and at that level uh the sector one component DNA becomes eligible to be controlled by a sector sector 2 entity and when that happens in the same way that a thermostat would take control of a room uh the thermostat being just a small part of that room but it controls the environment sector two is just a small part of a sector of a combination of sector one and two but it controls sector two and uh the overall uh linkage between sector 1 and sector two is called the life unit by Larson so life is the combination of uh you know a DNA molecule its most advanced form of sector one being controlled by a sector two entity and so this entity is being motivated so to speak by survival and uh this entity uh starts at a a single-celled organism and it grows and it develops and evolves up to its most complex level which Larson calls the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be controlled overall by what Larson calls a metaphysical unit or beyond space and time or independent of space and time Larson calls it sector three other people might call it God or the gods or the spiritual or the religious the numinous or whatever but uh that uh entity according to Larson is Guided by ethical Behavior or good behavior and so a human being that finds themselves in the middle between a sector two control and sector three control sometimes those things are uh work together but other times they are at Cross purposes and the human being has to decide through his Free Will which to choose the sector 3 entity of ethical Behavior or the sector 2 entity of survival Behavior or animal behavior and [Music] um sector 3 communicates with the human being through various means such as intuition uh scientific Insight religious revelation and uh that&#x27;s where we are so that&#x27;s what this final book uh called beyond space and time is about it&#x27;s about uh sector three phenomena and uh so we are in here in chapter 23 looking at uh religion re-examined and we&#x27;re toward the very beginning of this chapter and he&#x27;s talking about a rock rochement between science and religion um he says the principal obstacle to a reproachment between science and religion is thus completely demolished basically by the reciprocal system by the findings of this new work uh um the obstacles to that is demolished so we can we can have a merging of Science and religion under the reciprocal system uh so uh we&#x27;re gonna start with Larson right here all justification for the science scientists reluctance to concede the reality of religious Revelation has similarly been swept away the new findings of this book make it clear not only that such Revelations have been and are being received but that Revelation is merely one manifestation of a process of obtaining information from metaphysical sources that is widespread in human life and is in general use in the scientific fields then two we have established that the principles of morality do come to us from the metaphysical region through Revelation Intuition or Insight just as the religious organizations have always claimed aside from some assertions as to the nature of the metaphysical existence which are outside the scope of this present investigation before going are the basic religious doctrines to emphasize this point let us consider the following list of basic beliefs that the revealed religions have in common condensed from one compiled by William E Hocking want their six on this list one there is an existence outside the space-time universe or independent of the space-time Universe two there is contact between this existence and man three the external region is the home of divine agencies four the agencies are superior to us and should be obeyed and worshiped five there are ways of living that have the approval of the Divine agencies 6. The Souls of men or some of them enter in enter the external region after death okay uh that&#x27;s hacking now back to Larson on consideration of this list it is evident that the adjective Divine in items three and five should be replaced by some such word as non-physical inasmuch as the intention of item three is only to assert that the agencies exist and that of item five is to assert that there are ways of living approved by these agencies the significance of these two statements is independent of the nature of the agencies which is covered separately in item four the sweeping character of the victory which the scientific findings of this work give to religion in general over humanism materialism naturalism and other non-religious or anti-religious beliefs grounded on opinions as to the implications of the previous existing body of scientific knowledge is demonstrated by the fact that if the foregoing change in wording were made and some of the other language is given a reasonably broad interpretation four of the six statements have been definitely verified in the preceding Pages evidence confirming one more number six will be presented later and nothing adverse to the remaining unconfirmed statement number four has been found okay just going back here number four is these agencies are superior to us and should be obeyed and worshiped and number six is The Souls of men or some of them enter the external region after death okay so those are the two uh number six will be confirmed here later and number four is unconfirmed the others have been confirmed according to Larson back to him uh with the benefit of the factual knowledge of metaphysical existence and phenomena that has been developed in this work and the confirmation of the basic religious assertions it is now possible for the scientists to accept religion in General on the same basis that he accepts scientific theories that is on the strength of Reason applied to factual premises he is no longer called upon to exercise a faith a concept that to him has heretofore been essentially unintelligible and a very doubtful validity in order to find something that will invest human existence with the sense of purpose that is lacking in purely mechanistic science even Faith itself can now be seen to have a rational basis notwithstanding the fact that in application it is so vague and uncertain that the validity of any specific Article of Faith is open to question both religion and science have had a valid perception of certain metaphysical truths but it is much as their knowledge of these truths has been revealed received through intuitive processes there has hitherto been no way in which their validity could be substantiated acceptance has had to be based either on each&#x27;s each individual&#x27;s own intuitive perception of that validity or on his conviction intuitive or otherwise that a revelation claimed to have been received by someone else was genuine such a conviction is called faith our findings indicate that in absence of the kind of rational basis for religious beliefs that is being supplied by this work the religious appeal to faith has been to a considerable extent Justified religious Revelations have been received and in view of the extreme importance of these revealed truths the recipients and their Associates have considered themselves under an obligation to disseminate this knowledge white as widely as possible in the absence of any physical or intellectual way of demonstrating the validity of the revelations there has been no option but to call upon individuals to accept them without proof on first consideration it may seem that this is totally unwarranted but it should be realized that the persons to whom this exhortation is addressed are already intuitively prepared to accept it in part if not in its entirety for instance most people including most scientists have accepted the religious assertion that the Universe exists for a purpose and have rejected the scientific assertion that no such purpose exists because they have intuitive knowledge that there is a purpose similarly the religious assertion that there is an aspect of human life which transcends the limitations of physical existence falls upon ground already prepared for it by an intuitive realization that human life is in some respects basically different from all other kinds of biological life it should be understood however that the qualified justification which the present investigation finds for religious Faith applies only to those items that the individual accepts of his own accord that is where he has an intuitive perception that the Article of Faith is valid if he has any doubts then acceptance on the basis of faith is simply Reliance on the pronouncement of authority which has no scientific standing the religious extra exhortations to have faith therefore have no genuine effect unless unless the faith already exists that is the intuition is present it cannot be generated by persuasion missionary effort or proselytizing May succeed in modifying the form modifying the form of the intuitive belief it may substitute one God for another or alter opinions as to how he should be worshiped but the substance of such a belief is seldom changed our finding that religious faith has more justification than science has hitherto been willing to concede does not imply that the beliefs to which that Faith applies are necessarily valid religious intuition is subject to the same limitations as any other intuitive process its product is a probability not a certainty and the degree of probability is highly dependent on the kind of information that is involved as emphasized earlier present day interpretations of religious Revelations with respect to physical matters are generally wrong either because the original recipients were not adequately prepared to receive the information correctly or because the meaning of the original language is misunderstood the new findings give no support to interpretations of religious literature or tradition that reach conclusions of this nature conclusions that are in conflict with established scientific knowledge The credibility of archbishops Archbishop ushers assertion that the world was created in 4004 BC is not in the least enhanced by the fact that his calculations were based on data from Biblical sources okay I believe uh that is as far as we&#x27;re gonna get for today uh so he&#x27;s getting into some interesting stuff here um and uh you know the point that he&#x27;s emphasizing here at the end is just that we get religious Revelations intuition scientific insights um are those are always correct they&#x27;re coming from sector three they&#x27;re always correct our ability to translate them is limited and needs to be improved we need to practice so we often get them wrong but we could get them right okay we&#x27;ll see you next time have a great day</p>
