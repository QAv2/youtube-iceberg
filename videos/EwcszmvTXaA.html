            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do educational material today is the 114th video on the reciprocal system of theory a Theory of Everything derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and his work was carried on by others uh as well uh up to the present day uh but it is pretty sparse out there not too many people know about the reciprocal system so I thought I&#x27;d do uh you know a few months worth of videos on the reciprocal system to uh just to kind of resurrect try to resurrect some of its uh its features and uh its way of thinking because I think it is transformational in terms of it uh giving us the ability to figure things out for ourselves and not have to rely on the guys in the white lab coats and the guys in the pointy uh you know pointy-headed uh you know uh I don&#x27;t know what those things are called that the religious people wear but uh you know we can figure these things out for ourselves and come up with answers that make a lot more sense and that don&#x27;t cost anything um so uh we&#x27;re looking at his final book that is called beyond space and time and this gets into uh studies on metaphysics the religious and the philosophical and the um psychological and uh which is a departure from his earlier books which were all on the hard Sciences chemistry and physics and so on and um the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that the universe that we live in is a universe of motion not a universe of matter and not a universe of energy but a universe of motion matter and energy are merely types of motion among others where really every physical phenomena is a kind of motion that you can think of acceleration force pressure uh magnetic flux electric charge electric current these are all different forms of motion and they are all expressible in terms of space and time because Larson and for Larson motion is just the relationship between space and time so basically what you have is you have uh motion is a fraction of um a certain part of space in a certain part of it is time and time and space don&#x27;t exist in and of themselves but they exist together in motion and space and time are reciprocals of each other they&#x27;re inversions of one another in the same way that three-fourths and four-thirds are reciprocals of each other when you multiply them together you get one and um it&#x27;s the same with space and time being parts of motion and uh with as with any reciprocal whatever one quality one uh half of the reciprocal has the other half also has so space we know to be three or more Dimensions therefore time is three or more Dimensions um space we know to be Larson calls that uh coordinate space and coordinate time and uh we know time to be progressing or flowing always getting later and later and therefore space is also progressing or flowing always getting farther and farther apart Larson calls that clock time and clock space in addition space and time are both in only discrete units there is a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of space if you go below the minimum unit of space you are in a realm of only time and if you go beneath the uh realm of uh only space only time you are in a realm of only space Larson calls that the time region and the space region and um then there are two other regions that he calls the space-time region and the time space region uh and then there is a region between those okay now the um the discrete unit postulate that uh only time and space come in discrete units uh works out as one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is one over one and uh the speed of light is not as Einstein says the maximum speed of the universe but it is the midpoint of the universe or the null point or the midpoint or the neutral point or even the origin of the universe and that half of the universe is actually moving faster than the speed of light and the half that is moving slower than the speed of light we recognize that um as you know what we normally this is the our normal Universe Larson calls that the material sector or sector one the half that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light Larson calls that the cosmic sector or sector two and material Aggregates grow and uh um bond together through uh chemical bonding up until their most um complex level which is DNA and then at that point the DNA molecule has become um complicated enough complex enough to accommodate a uh entity from the cosmic sector and when that happens when there&#x27;s a cosmic and a material combination Larson calls that the life unit and the so the life unit is a a combination in the right proportions in the right configuration of time and space of sector one and sector two this life unit then grows and develops over the course of time uh up to its most complicated level which is according to Larson the intelligent human being and at that point the intelligent human being becomes eligible to be taking control over overall uh by a unit from sector three a sector three is the area that is entirely beyond space and time or the metaphysical this is what the last book that we&#x27;re looking at here of Larson&#x27;s is talking about beyond space and time this is uh what other people would call God or the gods or the uh the goddesses or religious or the spiritual and um Larson calls it sector three and this is an area where a region of the universe where everything is good and everything is correct and this uh these beings from sector three communicate with us they always give us good advice uh through uh things like telepathy uh ESP including telepathy also uh intuition scientific Insight religious Revelation and others and [Music] um unfortunately as uh basically single-celled spiritual organisms we are unable to decode these messages always correctly and so that&#x27;s kind of our challenge right now is to be able to decode these messages and make sense of them uh that requires preparation concentration dedication um and uh just a practice so that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at now we&#x27;re in the final chapter of this book uh chapter 28 that&#x27;s called human destiny uh we are not too far into the chapter but I will uh let Larson take over from here it is evident from the results of the physical investigation that culminated in the formation of the reciprocal system of physical theory that all changes taking place in the physical system are no more than transient the physical universe is always changing but its processes are cyclical so it always Remains the Same changes taking place in any One Direction are constantly being nullified by corresponding changes taking place in the opposite direction so that the physical universe as a whole conforms to what is known as the perfect cosmological principle that is it looks the same from any point in space or from any point in time the only one-way process that exists anywhere in the area covered by that investigation is the growth process whereby the non-physical control unit that directs the activities of level three of human existence level three of human existence being a human that is under the influence of sector three the level of ethical man ethical is one of his synonyms for sector three moral or ethical increases in complexity and sophistication our findings indicate that this unit is originally a simple structure comparable to the earliest biological units and that it undergoes a process of development simple similar to that which produces a the higher life forms from the original simple biological entities unlike the products of biological evolution the products of the sector 3 development process are permanent as they are independent of the processes of the physical universe here then is what is being accomplished the only permanent result of the operation of this enormously complex mechanism simple unit from sector 3 is developed into a complex unit in the course of and by reason of its association with a biological organism we may logically deduce on the basis of the considerations outlined in the foregoing paragraphs that this development is the purpose of existence in the physical universe at this point one may appropriately ask why the physical Universe must be brought into the picture why must we be exposed to all of the distressing features of biological life why cannot the desired results be accomplished in the general metaphysical region itself without the complication of the rather difficult existence in the physical universe there is no indication that the mechanistic responses of biological organisms that account for the evil and wrongdoing of which we are actively conscious contribute to progress toward the ultimate objective on the contrary so far as our investigation discloses they are merely byproducts of existence in a space-time Universe similar in this respect to our extreme vulnerability to physical damage we must conclude then that some feature of existence in the physical universe that is not present in the general metaphysical region is a requirement for the development of ethical personalities at the present stage of the investigation the question as to the nature of this feature cannot be answered positively but it is not unreasonable to conclude that the general metaphysical region the region outside the space-time universe and also outside any other universe that may exist is one in which no change takes place growth and development if they are to be achieved at all must be accomplished in a universe of change either our own or some other if as we may conjecture all universes of change or emotion are generally similar to our own physical Universe this explains why omnipotence if it exists cannot Place us in a universe free of evil those aspects of Life which we call evil are inherents in a universe of motion here we may appropriately make another application of the game analogy that was introduced earlier there is much distress even suffering at times among those who lose the contests of skill or chance these are evils of the same nature as those experienced in The Game of Life but they are unavoidable if there is to be a game even omnipotence cannot devise a competitive game in which everyone wins I guess Larson didn&#x27;t uh know about participation participation trophies okay uh back to Larson it should be noted that while we have identified the objective of human existence in terms of Conformity with the laws of sector three we are not yet in a position to say just what is included in those laws obviously compliance with the moral code is one component of the whole but perhaps something more than irreproachable thought and conduct are required this question was not investigated in the present work which is merely a Pioneer scientific Expedition into an area hitherto unknown to science and does not purport to be a complete exploration but the scope of these sector 3 requirements is a very significant issue and it deserves some mention in the final summing up of our results a rather striking feature of the conclusions reached in the investigation with which this volume is concerned is that they are completely silent with respect to one of the five subdivisions of philosophy listed in an earlier chapter as being those commonly included in the University philosophy disc courses metaphysics in the narrow sense and ethics were treated in considerable detail logic and epistemology were utilized in the work as investigative tools on the other hand Aesthetics does not enter into any of the subjects of discussion in any way what then is its place in the general picture surely it is not physical might it be possible that there are aesthetic standards that the human race will be required to meet as well as ethical standards must we learn to know and value that which is beautiful as well as that which is morally good these are questions that we cannot answer on the basis of the information that we now possess but they are high on the list of subjects for further investigation perhaps there are still other requirements that will have to be met this is what most of the organized religions insist but they see the situation in so many conflicting ways that it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions as to whether there is a common element among them that may represent something real the Western religions Place worship of the deity high on the list of requirements even to the extent in some cases of contending that this is the only thing that is absolutely essential but in the world as a whole this belief in the neces necessity of worship is far from unanimous while nothing in our findings contradicts it we cannot say that it is verified on the basis of the criteria of validity that we have established so far as this investigation is concerned therefore the issue Still Remains open in the event even if we consider the only the ethical aspect it is clear that the human race has a very long way to go few if any of the inhabitants of Earth reach the goal of perfection of ethical personality as expressed by one philosopher even the best men are not when they die in such a state of intellectual and moral perfection as would fit them to enter Heaven immediately the end quote the principal business of human life is obviously not being finished within the ordinary human lifetime some further action is required before the personality development is complete what then is the nature of this additional process as pointed out um only two possible ways of accomplishing this result have thus far been recognized a a sudden Improvement of a major and rather miraculous nature at the time of death and two some provision for additional periods of gradual development the doctrines of the Western religions lead in effect to the first of these alternatives the present study has not revealed any specific facts that would either affirm or deny its validity however as previously pointed out there does appear to be a significant element of inconsistency in this hypothesis that makes it extremely improbable if all of the tremendously complex mechanism of the physical universe is required in order to accomplish the first portion of the development of the ethical personality it hardly seems credible that the balance of the process by far the greater part could be accomplished Suddenly by Fiat the standard answer of the theologians to this criticism is that an omnipotent deity can accomplish anything even that which to the finite minds of human beings seems impossible but our findings have confirmed the general intuitive conviction that existence as a whole is rational as brought out in the previous discussion this limits the powers of omnipotence by excluding the irrational thus even if an omnipotent deity does exists question that is beyond the scope of the present investigation the hypothesis that calls for completion of the human personality by Divine decree is incompatible with the need for an enormously complex mechanism to begin the personality development okay now from here he&#x27;s going to go into a discussion about how the Eastern religions uh look at this uh at this point of view of you know what the human being is not prepared for sector three or for heaven or anything like that and what uh what needs to happen how it needs to happen how it can happen we&#x27;ll take that over uh tomorrow so uh thanks for tuning in I think we just have maybe two or three more days on this book here before we move on to something else we&#x27;ve got some surprises in store hopefully uh they will uh work out so thanks for tuning in we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
