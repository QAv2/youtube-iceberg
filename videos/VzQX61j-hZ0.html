            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>good day and welcome to a special Q&amp;A edition of reality check I&#x27;m your host Ross Kart and we&#x27;re giving you an opportunity to ask us questions in the live chat about our recent Prime Time special hunting UFOs which told the story of Jake Barber a former US Air Force Airman with an extraordinarily interesting history that saw him go down the rabbit hole of intelligence work and end up in what he describes as UAP crash retrievals at a location he refers to as the range now I&#x27;m going to invite you you can drop any questions you want into the chats uh on the uh the right of the screen uh but um I&#x27;ve got a few already because I&#x27;m trying to sort of make sure I&#x27;m prepared and all all set what I can tell you is that for obvious reasons journalistically there are some things I just can&#x27;t talk about and where that happens I&#x27;ll explain why and we&#x27;ll move on and please be patient I am trying to be as open and transparent with you as possible so to start Taylor from YouTube asked are there books or other research you recommend for someone trying to understand this phenomenon and our connections to it well look frankly there&#x27;s not been a lot of interesting books written about the psionics program because I don&#x27;t think anybody knew it existed until now but one book I am aware of that came up during my research is called above Black by an author called Dan Sherman and he tells a very interesting story of being a young man dragoned into an extraordinary Air Force program where he was basically asked to do things that I guess you could describe as psionic he&#x27;s being trained to receive Communications from some kind of non-human intelligence when I was first doing my research I was told to read above black and I must confess when I read it I thought this is a great piece of Science Fiction but now that I&#x27;ve actually gone away and had a talk to people inside the program I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s fiction the other one that I&#x27;m waiting for and uh I&#x27;ve been trying to find out what&#x27;s happened to it since the announcements that it was coming last 2023 I think it was yeah in April 2023 Simon and Schuster an imprint uh known as Gallery Brooks won a bidding war for publishing rights to a supposedly true story rooted in intrigue surrounding a US Air Force program and the author alleged is a guy who calls himself Scott Andrews which is I&#x27;m sure not His Real Name a former senior US soldier decorated intelligence officer who conducted Global counterterrorism operations on behalf of the US and I&#x27;m fascinated with this book I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still coming out maybe it&#x27;s still going through dosr defend office pre-publication Security review uh approval but um in the blurb that was published at the time in April 2023 Andrews came across a file compiled for him by his late father containing records from a past he did not remember including documents indicating he was removed from school for weeks every year from the 1 through 12th grades it also contained evidence that he&#x27; received an honorable discharge from the US Air Force and that he worked in space intelligence Communications as a minor now that&#x27;s very interesting because I initially thought that was science fiction as well and I&#x27;m now talking to people who&#x27;ve been inside the psionics program who also tell me that they were recruited as children and in fact there is some evidence to suggest if you are willing to believe this I don&#x27;t expect you to but I&#x27;ll give it a go anyway that the best psionics are kids and uh as well as the left-handed gays that we talked about in the actual program prepubescent children are often targeted in schools through the gate program the gifted and talented education program and I&#x27;ve issued an appeal before for people who are interested in talking to me about this um I am aware from talking to multiple people now that there were children who were diverted outside of the school system into a program that was administered by the US military or intelligence community that involved training in psionics I know it sounds like an episode of stranger things and by golly it it certainly presents as such some of what happened is quite terrifying and I&#x27;m sure for any little child it was absolutely scarifying anyway so those are the two books I&#x27;m interested in above black Dan Sherman is the one I&#x27;m most recommending to you Lenny from YouTube wants to know what&#x27;s Jake most prominent takeaway from The Experience he had well look I wouldn&#x27;t purport to speak for Jake but my impression would be love it would be simply that here&#x27;s this guy who&#x27;s trained as a tier one Warrior and him and his mates have Come Away with the overwhelming impression that this is a non-human intelligence that actually does want to engage with us humans and um and it&#x27;s conveying a very strong message of love it wants to share uh the idea that human beings have capabilities with our Consciousness Consciousness communication if you like which we&#x27;re not fully aware of but which can be mastered uh Danilo from YouTube asks will Michael Herrera and Steven Greer be in any future follow-up how did Jake and his team approach you was Steven Greer a part of any background agreement well going backwards no Steven Greer was not part of any background agreement I&#x27;m not sure what you mean there um I haven&#x27;t had anything to do with Steven Greer uh did how did Jake and his team approach us they didn&#x27;t approach us we approached them through an intermediary uh will Michael Herrera and Steven Greer be in any future followup uh I can tell you I&#x27;m talking to Michael Herrera and as you would know if you&#x27;re watching um Michael Herrera I can now reveal as Jake revealed in his long form interview that Jake gives credibility to Michael herrera&#x27;s account in Indonesia on a relief operation of him and his Patrol coming across what he described as some kind of PODS and the reason why those pods are significant uh I think originally Michael Herrera and Steven Greer mistakenly assumed that these pods were being used for trafficking humans against their will that there was some kind of criminal human trafficking operation going on it&#x27;s all possible it&#x27;s illegal or criminal but the simple fact is these people were not I&#x27;m told being taken against their will what was actually happening uh and to some degree what Jake&#x27;s talking about here is speculative what he can identify are the pods that Michael Herrera describes and the eight gone craft that that was on the location in Indonesia he says that everything that Herrera describes is consistent with his understanding of what he&#x27;s seen in the program albe it the eight gone craft is considerably smaller it does sound like that craft that Michael Herrera saw was some kind of reproduction vehicle which if true raises the very real possibility probability that yes the United States May well have crafted this technology to such a point that it&#x27;s been able to reproduce some of the capabilities of the nhi tech I don&#x27;t know that for sure at the moment if anybody wants to ask me this question what I do know is that we have learned how to operate the nhi tech that is retrieved using human consciousness my sources are actually telling me that it has been an extremely difficult process to attempt to replicate the M materials science technology behind these craft that it&#x27;s literally thousands of years ahead of our capabilities so there&#x27;s a Nuance there but what I can tell you is that Jake has told me that the Pod that Michael Herrera gave Jake a very clear and accurate description of uh is is essentially conforming to the shape and design of the objects that are used by the psionic assists in the program that essentially in order to assist the psionic assists to do what they do which is to consciously Connect using their abilities to nhi craft and I know this sounds like science fiction they need somewhere to essentially meditate and that these pods provide them with that capability that&#x27;s all I know for the moment uh let&#x27;s answer some of the questions that are coming out on the Q&amp;A um oh Christ I&#x27;ll be here all day um okay let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do the right one the first one on the list let&#x27;s go let&#x27;s go Jesus Christ how many already my God forgive me for being profane I apologize in advance okay what does Jake think of the goings on at Skinwalker r um uh what I can tell you is skywatcher would be very very interested in assisting Skinwalker Ranch that&#x27;s all I can tell you for the moment um uh these are part of a government conditioning program in response to the leak this is why grush came in and distracted the media from fravor oh we wacky stuff there don&#x27;t know what that person is talking about um somebody has a conspiracy theory apparently we&#x27;re part of a CIA front how does one enable psionics to call for UAP UFOs asks pude that&#x27;s a good question as best as I can understand it there are some people who have a predisposition and it may very well be because of their enlarged basil ganglia neurons um at the cordate paman uh it has been suggested to me that most or All Humans could actually develop this capability if they were properly trained but but essentially it&#x27;s a form of meditation it&#x27;s a form of engage engagement using human consciousness to engage with nhi I can tell you I&#x27;ve been trying to teach myself how to meditate I sure as hell haven&#x27;t been able to communicate with nhi but I have seen it demonstrated and it involves intense meditation and the person that I was watching do it or the people that I&#x27;ve watched do it have had enormous amounts of training over hundreds of hours so that&#x27;s really all I know for the moment I believe in the phenomenon is oh it&#x27;s the same person I&#x27;m honestly you had your say mate this is Charles Wilson blah blah blah blah blah boring go away and put your wacky conspiracy theories to someone else I frankly don&#x27;t care the wacky conspiracy theories of people out there that this is part of some scop honestly go and dig a hole and lie in it um where did the Christians get emailed to uh oh God honestly are a lot of paranoid people out there you know the thing I just want to say here you have an opportunity the UAP social media commentary world for years has been asking for firsthand Witnesses now they have them and there is a small but highly vocal minority out there on social media UAP commentary who are now in the most deranged and paranoid way questioning why these people are coming forward skepticisms important and believe me I&#x27;ve been skeptical with these guys I&#x27;ve put them through the ringer but being rude and essentially questioning their patriotism and slurring them with defamatory imputations I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m not going to give that a run um by all means ask sensible questions and I&#x27;m here to answer the right ones uh is there a sect of people that have always known these nhi existed do these people have influence over most All Nations a sect of people that that implies some kind of religious connotation no I am not aware of any religious knowledge of this one thing that does interest me is I do think the Church of Scientology knows a lot more than it&#x27;s letting on and it&#x27;s interesting because Danny shien has indicated something about this I strongly recommend people go back and have a look at his interviews I also think that it&#x27;s interesting that the Mormon church has an inordinate number of people working inside the Legacy program and yes we know who you are I have names I have locations I have people who are managerial roles in the Mormon Church who just also happen to be in very senior positions in the Legacy program and it&#x27;s interesting maybe maybe people in the Mormon faith find it in many ways because so much of the Mormon faith is derived allegedly from an alien communication if you read the history of the church maybe they believe believe that it validates their religion for this to be revealed or explored I don&#x27;t know but no I&#x27;m not aware of any kind of sect or religion that is sharing this knowledge I do think that there are some religious institutions though such as the Mormons and the scientologists that have done a lot of work into this area and frankly I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything Sinister in that um if I had the resources I&#x27;d be pouring money into investigating this as well uh are there any aerospace companies ready to end the cover up asks Mew oh great question it&#x27;s interesting not officially but it&#x27;s interesting some are discreetly or some individuals within those companies are discreetly reaching out I&#x27;ve had two conversations now uh one really particularly Illuminating conversation with an executive from a certain well-known Aerospace company and we had a really Frank conversation and I said listen this is ridiculous why why persist in the cover up and the best explanation they could give me is there&#x27;s really no good reason for why the public can&#x27;t know at the very least about the existence of non-human intelligences engaging with this planet what they&#x27;re worried about is being forced on a slippery slope they&#x27;re forced that disclosure would force them or compel them to reveal things that are regarded as National Security sensitive such as what level of development of Weaponry or propulsion cap capabilities or energy capabilities has been derived from this non-human tick I&#x27;ll be brutal though and say I actually think a lot of those excuses are self-serving these people have committed crimes in some cases they are accused of committing and ordering murder that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to hide and I think it&#x27;s very self-serving that right up to the level I believe of the National Security Council of the White House there is an attempt to suppress this story with Congress people and Senators being told to shut up and not ask questions and stop rocking the boat on the UAP issue there&#x27;s a very strong and deliberate and I think panicking attempt to shut this all down and it&#x27;s interesting because president Trump incredibly has come in very much on a platform of revealing what he calls the Deep State and whatever you think about the Rights and Wrongs of claims about the Deep State the vow of people who are concealing an allegedly illegal and criminal program that is spending billions of dollars of taxpayer funds in an unauthorized way is by definition a deep State cabal and I think it&#x27;s incumbent on President Trump to honor his pledge not only to investigate the drones or socalled drones I think they&#x27;re much more than drones they&#x27;re certainly anomalous in many cases but also to investigate the UA phenomenon and there&#x27;s a strong call on both sides of Congress for this to be done and I guess what&#x27;s happening what&#x27;s what&#x27;s my view on what&#x27;s Happening I think the incoming president is gauging taking a temperature he&#x27;s probably going to ask for a briefing about what&#x27;s really going on in the UAP retrieval program and I suspect successive presidents when they have asked this have been shut down and it&#x27;s going to be a matter of courage and transactional judgment for the new president whether it&#x27;s something that he wants to reveal there&#x27;s certainly a push from prominent people in Congress including for example Chuck Schumer and indeed from Marco Rubio who&#x27;s spoken out previously now the new secretary of state but Donald Trump it&#x27;s very clear is his own man and I think the final judgment will be up to him but as you saw from my interview with Donald Trump Jr there&#x27;s certainly Keen interest inside the family and boy if the phone calls I&#x27;ve been getting from people in the Trump Administration is any gauge there certainly is a mood to get into this subject with relish and if I was somebody in private Aerospace who&#x27;s sitting on this secret I would be making a clean breast of it and coming out I really do think I mean in all honesty um apart from the people that have ordered murders which I think should be held to account and properly prosecuted and investigated I really do think that there&#x27;s a really good strong argument that in the interests of Truth in the interests of public right to know we should offer a Reconciliation Truth and Reconciliation Commission where these people are given an opportunity to tell the truth in a public forum a bit like a church commission no attempted concealment like there was at the church commission oh my goodness what the CIA hid in the church commission and I think the the opportunity exists for there to be a reckoning and for there to be a public accounting and yes if there is stuff that ought properly to be retained as confidential National Security sensitive then do so let make your argument uh let&#x27;s have a look um uh let me have a look honestly the number of people who just winge on chats guys you&#x27;re there to ask questions do these nhi have anything at all to do this is your producer here I have a couple of great questions for you from Tik Tok so I wanted to chime in um I&#x27;m sending to you them in a private chat here but we do have some people asking we have Whitney from Tik to asking if there&#x27;s any more whistleblowers that you think are going to come forward okay that&#x27;s a good one to start with thanks Alex um yes there are other whistleblowers believe me there&#x27;s a Conger line of whistleblowers who are waiting to come forward and a lot of how they feel about coming forward is dependent on how they get treated and how Jake Barber gets treated um Jake is courageous I mean the decision by him and Don and Fred and John to speak so candidly is an act of Courage uh I take my hat off to them um and how they get treated is a barometer for the other people who are sitting in the back robs waiting to see if they should come forward I have to say it&#x27;s a bit depressing because they don&#x27;t really have that much faith in Congress because some of them have already given their evidence to Congress and been ignored some of them have already given their evidence to Arrow under Dr Shan k Patrick and also being ignored and they&#x27;re very frustrated they&#x27;re not seeing a resolve from Congress and that&#x27;s because there are a bunch of jelly backs in the politicians in there who frankly are just only interested in their self-interest they&#x27;re transactional people who are making a judgment about what&#x27;s best for them not for the US taxpayer or indeed The World At Large what we need is political courage and I guess a lot of people are looking to president Trump will the new president be a man of resolve will he stand by what he&#x27;s promised to do will he challenge the Deep State the cabal that is protecting this secret will he be nobbled by the intelligence Community it is as it is so desperately trying to do uh question from Tik Tok in the chats do we know what was inside the egg shaped U UAP were there words on the outside uh no and no uh there were no uh there was no indication from the people that uh appeared in the program they have no knowledge of what was inside the uh egg-shaped craft because they were the retrieval people and the way it works in the program is it&#x27;s very compartmentalized you have a team who do the retrieval you have the team who do the pickup on the flatbed and take it to the facility and I am talking to people who&#x27;ve been involved in the receiving end and for them it&#x27;s a lot more sensitive because they&#x27;re slightly more senior let&#x27;s put it at that without revealing too much and they&#x27;re making a value judgment about what happens they&#x27;re waiting for president Trump to indicate that he&#x27;s actually serious about this and once the president indicates that he is serious about this by golly the floodgates are are going to open um uh do you speak with journalists like nap Corel and other journalists before you come out with whistleblower specials uh look I do talk to George and Jeremy and other journalists um but um obviously I haven&#x27;t told them that I&#x27;m working on this story uh journalists work as comp competition uh I&#x27;ve got huge Respect by the way for George nap and uh what he does he&#x27;s done some fantastic work over the years and um uh I I was surprised by the way that Jeremy&#x27;s role in getting hold of the imaculate constellation document wasn&#x27;t disclosed to the Congress if that&#x27;s correct I&#x27;m really shocked to hear that and uh I um I&#x27;m pretty sure by the way that the person who provided the immaculate constellation document uh is somebody that I&#x27;m aware of and I had a conversation with them at one stage and explained that because I work in TV I needed somebody who could prove the provence of the document and that might have been a confounding issue and that person deciding whether or not they went with me I&#x27;m not sure but yes I do talk to journalists all the time um but the idea that um sometimes we do do collaborations I&#x27;ve done collaborations with journalists over the years ironically with the New York Times and Washington Post on other stories um I I don&#x27;t have a very high opinion frankly of those newspapers and their determination to cover the UAP issue but uh yeah there are things that involve journalistic collaboration I&#x27;ve been part of an organization for some time called ICI J the international Consortium of investigative journalists which is based out of Washington DC and they do fantastic crossborder transnational collaborations on stories of major interest uh what did I have some more questions for you someone named Tommy on Instagram is asking if you&#x27;ve ever spoken with anyone in the federal government about some of the interviews you&#x27;ve done and what have they told you in response that&#x27;s a really good question uh yes I have spoken to people in the federal government um let me put it this way I am aware of an ongoing secret FBI investigation which is investigating not only the drones but also some of the allegations behind the UAP retrieval program yes if I was Private Aerospace or people in the intelligence Community who are doing this illegal work I would be very very nervous I would be thinking about my options right now if I was say somebody in a senior level in private Aerospace who was approached by Jake Barber and his team and told that they were thinking of taking this issue to the appropriate authorities I would be looking at my options right now I really would yes the further answer to the question is I have been in touch with multiple people in the federal government in investigative agencies and also senators and Congress people and people who are in the senior levels of the Trump Administration there is ongoing communication right now yes believe me communication is happening they are taking these issues very very seriously I&#x27;m G to leave it at that um hey so someone earlier had asked on YouTube and because you mentioned the Trump Administration I thought I&#x27;d jump in about the declassification of files and if you think that&#x27;s still going to happen happen or you know is it going to be detected or what are we going to see uh that&#x27;s a really good question I have no lead on whether president Trump is going to follow through with his promise to release the UFO videos that are still secreted um one of the excuses that I understand has been used in the past by the military and the intelligence Community to justify the non-release of UAP videos is that to release them would reveal sources and means capabilities and methods now I&#x27;m told frankly that that is nonsense that as has been demonstrated in the past with um events where we&#x27;ve wanted to show interdictions between Russian aircraft and US drones over the Black Sea where us drones have been improperly and indeed illegally under international law meddled with by U by Russian aircraft we&#x27;ve been quite happy to show the highdef imagery that know exists from these drone Technologies um I received actually I&#x27;ve actually asked this question uh of people in the intelligence community and they&#x27;ve told me that there is certain data that can be hidden or blurred on a screen to stop the um for example the heads up displays from fighter jets from revealing anything inadvertent that might reveal capabilities I&#x27;m told that there are extraordinary highdef videos that are in the possession of the UAP uh investigation office that&#x27;s the arrow the all domain anomaly resolution office but also I&#x27;m told there are a hell of a lot more videos inside the defense intelligence agency and other intelligence agencies notably the CIA office of global access and I don&#x27;t know whether we&#x27;re ever going to see any of those because frankly a lot depends on whether the president&#x27;s serious about honoring his pledge to reveal those videos and in fact to further investigate the UAP issue I can tell you if the volume of responses that I&#x27;ve been getting from people in the um in the new Administration is any indication it does seem very clear that there are people at a very senior level in the administration who do want to get to the truth of the allegations about a UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program particularly because it involves the expenditure allegedly of huge amounts of taxpayer money what worries me is presidents get seduced by intelligence presidents get seduced by the idea that they&#x27;re getting access to this knowledge and it worries me that you&#x27;ll get some slimy guy from the intelligence Community going into the Oval Office and saying you know Mr President this is the biggest secret of all because it&#x27;s the most important thing in our Armory that we&#x27;ve got to defend ourselves against the Russians and the Chinese the public can&#x27;t know about nhi because if they are told about nhi it will force us to reveal all of our secrets now frankly I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s tenable anymore more I do think that the public respect why we can&#x27;t know how to make a thermonuclear bomb and just because there are secrets held by the department of energy and the military about how to make a thermonuclear bomb and just because we know that those bombs exist doesn&#x27;t mean that the secrets going to leak out and I think the same thing about nhi it is ridiculous any longer for the government to maintain this fiction I actually think it&#x27;s more to do with a bunch of stiff sin suits who are frightened of admit that they&#x27;ve been lying for years it&#x27;s as simple as that it&#x27;s always the coverup that gets these people they can&#x27;t they can&#x27;t deal with the fact that they actually have to fess up about the fact that they&#x27;ve lied um a lot of people slanging us off about audio issues I hope that it&#x27;s not my end um but yes I do agree we did have terrible audio problems with the Don Paul Bales interview and I apologize for that it was completely outside of my control um I think it&#x27;s kind of telling that nobody from Barber&#x27;s Post is discrediting him if the guy was a loon I think they would be speaking up that&#x27;s from Hungry wind dingo I completely agree I mean you haven&#x27;t heard a peep out of the defense department about the allegations made by Jake Barber and his team and the reason why is because they know it&#x27;s true and what they&#x27;re most worried about is what else does Jake Barber have and I can tell you he has a hell of a lot more and he has provided it to the Senate select committee for intelligence I think a lot of people should be asking the Senate Select Committee for intelligence why hasn&#x27;t it done anything with the evidence that was provided to it last year by Jake barber in a closed four and a half hour hearing um I&#x27;m still scrolling through Alex if you&#x27;ve got any um there&#x27;s just so many messages with people just making comments sure no absolutely we have Christopher from YouTube he asked how many different types of nhi have been described to you oh that&#x27;s a good question um okay this did not come from anybody in the recent program but yes I am aware of claims of multiple different times types of nhi um should we say uh certainly minimum eight different types of craft and probably to be sure from Witnesses multiple Witnesses six different types of species I hope that answers your question and and and don&#x27;t ask me which ones um uh let me have a look here if you have someone who can pilot this thing why not during the dur during the day for better imagery oh believe me there is better imagery um uh one of the issues for the people who provided us with that video and it did not come by the way from Mr Barber or his team is that the difficulty with selecting which video to provide comes from enabling identification of the person who procured it and so um uh for the people that have taken the risks to Providers with the video uh it is a very delicate balance and so some of the really good imagery is daytime imagery and it exists believe me um and I am aware of other imagery and uh it&#x27;s pretty bloody good um yeah someone here from YouTube ask if you&#x27;ve seen something personally that&#x27;s undeniable proof of NHS look if it&#x27;s if you&#x27;re asking me have I seen a video that&#x27;s undeniable proof of nhi I don&#x27;t think any video would ever satisfy any debunker skeptic or you know crackpot crackpot dubious person the simple fact is um what what level of evidence I mean we&#x27;ve had people squawking for years about the need for firsthand witnesses to the Legacy retrieval program and the small vocal minority on on Twitter and other uh forums is basically saying oh you know yes but what what evidence is there still and and the simple fact is I don&#x27;t know what evidence convinces people um I don&#x27;t even know if people would believe it if the president stood up and said ladies and gentlemen we&#x27;ve been lying to you for 70 years but that may eventually happen any more Alex yes so that brings me to the next question uh Tommy from Instagram asks do you think another country say China might disclose information before the United States yes I do and indeed that has been touted as a very serious possibility let me say categorically I know for a fact that the Chinese and the Russians have retrieved craft and in fact absurdly I&#x27;m aware of um sit situations where early in glasnost Americans were involved with Russians in a retrieval go figure now that we&#x27;ve fallen out and um don&#x27;t get on with each other anymore the thing I find really interesting is that the Russians and the Chinese both know about nhi it&#x27;s an Open Secret and I I don&#x27;t know necessarily that there&#x27;s been some kind of an agreement between the Russians and the Americans and the Chinese not to reveal this but I think for all of them there is this secret cold war going on this secret arms race that David grush referred to in his interview with me in June 2023 they are all competing and indeed there have been situations where there have been retrievals overseas by Americans and there have been situations where they are essentially competing with foreign adversary Rivals to recover those objects before they do it&#x27;s a very interesting situation and uh yes there are archaeological finds and and um people might guess what I&#x27;m talking about anymore Alex because I frankly can&#x27;t keep up thee few people have asked about whether you&#x27;ve heard stories similar to Barbers before oh yeah yeah no absolutely uh it&#x27;s funny actually because when um this goes right back to a guy I wrot about in my book Nat who was essentially the R&amp;D geek for the US Navy and um Nat told me before he died that there was a legacy program and he was a lot more candid with me than I reveal in my book I can reveal now he introduced me to multiple people who told me and introduced me to people in the Legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program and so when I heard from Jake to be honest with you the one thing I hadn&#x27;t heard about I&#x27;ve been talking to a lot of people in the material science side people who are frankly frustrated that as scientists the work that they&#x27;re doing is being frustrated by secrecy that the ridiculous compartmentalization imposed on them by the secrecy of the Legacy reverse engineering program is failing in some degree because what&#x27;s needed is a kind of a Manhattan Project a huge collaboration between All Nations to try and break through this material science technology and so that&#x27;s the sort of stuff I was hearing before the scenes and I knew there were retrieval teams and I&#x27;d spoken to somebody on the retrieval teams but I I&#x27;d never spoken to somebody with the depth of knowledge that Jake and his team and and indeed other people that I&#x27;ve spoken to have told me about and I think the thing that really shocked me most of all was the psionic the human consciousness connection to the phenomenon that completely blew me away and the hard and skeptic in me took a long time to believe it to be perfectly honest Alex I&#x27;m going to get you to give me some more because there&#x27;s like a thousand comments abely it&#x27;s great please keep asking us questions um Arc from YouTube asked um what do they mean about aliens being interdimensional I&#x27;m assuming this is something we&#x27;ve talked about in the special before yeah it&#x27;s something that David grush talked about too um and look to be honest I&#x27;m not a Quantum physicist but I do know that in quantum physics a multi-dimensional universe is hypothesized and it would explain the mathematics behind our understanding of the universe currently it may also explain why when Arrow uses the term extra terrestrial they&#x27;re not lying perhaps maybe they know that these entities are from Earth but perhaps From Another Dimension or perhaps they&#x27;re intra dimensional in the sense that they come from this this planet um I really don&#x27;t know and it would be speculation on my part to actually say one way or the other uh one more shillo 20110 says how many of you are fully informed re UFOs and Ross&#x27;s various oh no sorry that&#x27;s not a question Alex give me one it&#x27;s probably better if you just feed them to me no that&#x27;s great um we have a question from Instagram and this is something we did a live on before Ross I&#x27;m sure you remember are the drones in New Jersey connected to UAP boy that is the $100 question let me ask it let me answer it this way I am talking to people both in government uh I&#x27;ve spoken to people in an FBI investigating task force and I&#x27;ve spoken to my two favorite citizen scientists John and Jerry Tesco and Donna leardo who have got their fantastic civilian scientific operation off the coast of Long Island nobody I&#x27;m talking to thinks that these soal called drones are just prosaic terrestrial drone technology if they are drones they&#x27;re represent a level of technology that is far beyond our current known abilities uh some of them have been known to literally disappear and reappear in other parts of the sky almost immediately they&#x27;re moving at speeds far beyond known speeds of terrestrial drones and they&#x27;re also showing a morphing characteristic where in some cases quite amusingly they&#x27;ve changed their shape to make themselves look like animals and the thing that I&#x27;m actually going to be doing a story about this by the way later in the week you keep an eye on reality check because we&#x27;ve got far more to come on this the thing that blows me away on this is the the uh the lies and and I do think we need to call this out the absolute lies that are being told by the defense department sadly depart of Homeland Security the Federal Aviation Administration all of these agencies colluded in a press release in mid December to falsely convey a narrative that these objects were just simply misperceptions by the public and that everybody was suffering some kind of mass hysteria and boy one thing I have learned in this story is do not piss off people from New Jersey they&#x27;re tough they&#x27;re really formidable strong-minded people and they don&#x27;t put up with BS and they&#x27;re sick of being gaslit and so I&#x27;m talking to people in County politics local sheriffs police FBI civilian Witnesses all of whom are telling me that they&#x27;re seeing anomalous character characteristics to these objects and they&#x27;re genuinely concerned about it a lot of these objects are appearing in restricted airspace in areas where drones were banned car categorically I&#x27;ve spoken to people who&#x27;ve told me that there&#x27;s been a attempts to use high pulse microwave systems the definitive objects technology for bringing down uh drone technology and the HPM systems have failed there was a um a military unit secretly deployed off the coast of New Jersey to use this technology on the objects that were appearing over the ocean and they had to be very careful how they use it because this HPM technology operates in a broad spectrum and can knock out any aircraft in the area so they have used it and it has failed so yes there is something to do with these so-called drones that I think is anomalous and I think that the federal government has at least some idea of the fact that these objects well we know for a fact it was actually reported the FBI acknowledged recently that they have not been able to bring down one of these drones and they still don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re coming from imagine that I mean I I I don&#x27;t understand the willful blindness of so much of the mainstream media on this you have over the national capital Washington DC drones in some cases hovering near the White House and the Congress showing anomalous performance characteristics incapable of being brought down not displaying the normal uh technological signals of who they are and where they come from that are required by law and what does the government do about about it nothing now that&#x27;s led a lot of people to conclude including people I&#x27;m talking to in the intelligence Community they&#x27;ve speculated that this must be some kind of advanced drone technology that&#x27;s being tested by the government and indeed that&#x27;s what I thought for a while but I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the case anymore I&#x27;m being told by people they have no idea where these objects are coming from they were speculating that they were coming from the ocean but they&#x27;ve deployed units secretly to try and to dict where those objects are coming from and they haven&#x27;t been able to do so in fact the entire investigation into the soall drones has been a failure and if you look at the comparison between how we responded to the overflights of in one case a Chinese balloon and three other objects over the United States in February 2023 and then compare the hysteria and outrage about those incursions and National Security threats and Public Safety threats posed by that technology back then and then you look at the way that frankly the media has been clamped down upon to shut up about these drones there&#x27;s something wrong I don&#x27;t know what it is I don&#x27;t know why there is this willful blindness but I can tell you these objects are in many cases showing anomalous performance characteristics the FBI knows that they&#x27;re as confounded as you and I are about it but higher up right up to say oo the NSC the National Security Council of the White House somebody&#x27;s clamping down on it the big question is why Alex any more yes we do we have someone from YouTube asking if we&#x27;ve heard of egg-shaped UAP before I know we talk a lot about discs Tic Tacs all of that but what about egg shaped oh yeah look egg shaped UAP go right back to the 1940s I write about it in my book uh we talk about the fact that scientists who were doing the nuclear bomb experiments at Los Alamos they reported seeing egg-shaped objects hovering over the nuclear test site this is something that is one of the most consistent shapes reported going back many many decades and it&#x27;s really interesting because if you actually look at the accounts of the size of the objects they&#x27;re entirely consistent with the object that was recovered by the retrieval team in the video that we showed so yes there is a long history of egg-shaped UFOs and frankly if you look at the Foo Fighters from World War II uh it&#x27;s consistent with the Foo Fighter shape and more importantly I was talking to somebody the other day who said to me that what we call the Tic Tac which is a cylindrical UFO May in fact be the eggs but it&#x27;s a consequence of how we see them through some kind of Blu shift that because they&#x27;re moving so fast and because of the technology that they&#x27;re using to move it may very well be that we perceive them when they&#x27;re moving at high speed as some kind of cylinder I.E a Tic Tac Alex yeah a couple people are asking about um if you know of any successful situations when it comes to reverse engineering aircrafts look it&#x27;s funny I&#x27;m getting contradictory stories about this on the one hand you&#x27;ve got say for example the Michael Herrera account from Indonesia which would suggest that certainly a private Aerospace company is using what appears to be reverse engineered technology and that was a gigantic octagon craft being used to move people and machines from Indonesia presumably back to the Continental USA um I don&#x27;t know whether that indeed is reverse engineered technology but yes there are if you like what&#x27;s the word there are data points which would suggest that there have been reverse engineered technology notably for example the calvine uh AP craft which I suspect was being operated out of RAF mro henish I forgive me if I pronounced that wrong in Scotland which was a a very large secluded RAF base on the west coast of Scotland which was used regularly by the United States I think it&#x27;s closed now but I do think in history there&#x27;s been data points which suggest that there is something going on in my book for example I talk about a guy on an oil rig who witnessed um jet aircraft escorting um what appeared to be a triangular-shaped object uh moving across the Atlantic but what I do know from scientists inside the program is that there has been um a lot of frustration with attempts to emulate the material science that is represented by these Technologies I just don&#x27;t know enough about it I know that the program is very compartmentalized and I&#x27;ve spoken without giving any secrets to people in the program who&#x27;ve told me that they&#x27;ve worked in specific locations and I suspect that there may very well be parts of the program that a lot of people don&#x27;t know about I don&#x27;t know I mean I know somebody at some stage is going to ask me am I aware of any Interstellar craft you know is the is the secret space program a reality frankly I have no idea and please don&#x27;t ask me about the the 20 and back program I have no idea if that&#x27;s true not Alex yeah we have an Instagram question can you go into more detail about what you saw during the Gathering you and Jake attended ah um well I I&#x27;ve yes um we&#x27;re talking here about a retreat that took place at esselin which is a beautiful location three and a half four hours south of San Francisco on the west coast of the USA and it was a gathering of very high net worth individuals uh and Brilliant scientists and some inordinately talented people and yes Jake and I attended that Retreat and to some degree I am Bound by confidence but what I can tell you is I witnessed a psionic who I know um a person with alleged psionic abilities psychic abilities list them in a group of people probably 30 or 40 people go into a deep meditative State and I just want to say this person had said to me at 400 p.m. that afternoon Ross were going to see a blue orb tonight and I kind of giggled nervously and anyway what happened was he starts meditating and Bing up on the far Horizon over the ocean these two white orbs slightly golden at times they start coming towards us and um I I won&#x27;t embarrass this gentleman but there&#x27;s a a certain person of extraordinary high wealth and extraordinary big heart who&#x27;s yelling at these objects going we love you we love you come closer come closer and the whole audience you know we&#x27;re all we&#x27;ve all been meditating and being invited to sort of try and psychically connect it I am a miserable failure of a meditator if anybody wants to teach me how to meditate I&#x27;d be very very grateful but something happened and I suspect it was our pionic operator who made the connection because he later indicated to me that in his his mind he was inside that object and he was bringing it towards us and the audience is loving engagement and I know this sounds hippie-ish I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m just telling it like I heard it and saw it but essentially the loving engagement with that phenomenon encouraged it to come closer and they did they came closer and closer and closer and I&#x27;m not going to give away too much because it&#x27;s for Alex clus and the skywatcher team to to reveal how much they want to reveal because it&#x27;s a beautiful story but basically I&#x27;ll tell you this um we were in one part of esselin and there were a whole lot of people in the hot springs at Elin on the other side of the hill and I&#x27;m far too shy as a old guy to go and sit in Hot Springs with beautiful young women but there were essentially a a bunch of beautiful young people sitting Stark naked in these hot springs on the other side of Iselin and all of a sudden they see these blue shapes coalescing in front of them and sure enough we got images from the hill looking down of a blue orb a beautiful at times octagonal looking blue orb which kind of hovered near the naked boys and girls in the hot springs and then it went and landed on the beach and it was hilarious cuz I&#x27;d said to the um the lovely young psionic I&#x27;d said to him well mate that was pretty amazing but but I didn&#x27;t see any blue orb and he was a bit puzzled and then literally at the moment that we&#x27;re talking about the fact that we hadn&#x27;t seen the blue orb it turned out it had manifested itself to these beautiful young people on the other side of the Hill who were all Stark naked and probably I think in their naked innocence more attractive to the phenomenon I have to admit I&#x27;d be I&#x27;d be going and having a look at them rather than me and um anybody else with clothes on uh and it was it was quite beautiful because these people were all very touched by that experience and yes there was a blue orb exactly as was predicted that showed itself to all of these people it was quite beautiful and um yes it did manifest more overtly because of a loving welcoming presence which I find fascinating Alex yeah a few people are asking if you think psionics are game changers when it comes to discovering more about UAP uh let put it this way I think U it is absolutely integral to an understanding of what uaps are that we understand the capabilities of human consciousness there is a definite I&#x27;ve seen it Consciousness Connection between the human mind and the capability to connect to whatever this is be it a technology or a being or a sentience of some kind um people I&#x27;ve spoken to inside the program I should mention this by the way who&#x27;ve told me they&#x27;ve seen inside the egg and other craft they tell me there&#x27;s no control uh you know there&#x27;s no steering wheel or no levers to push basically they&#x27;re almost empty and it would explain why the capacity to psionically connect with that technology is the way that it&#x27;s used another story I got told without giving away any names is that for years there was a craft that was hovering in one of these dark secret black World warehouses and nobody could figure out how to open the bloody thing and from recollection the guy one day one of the BLS working on it put his hand against the side of it and just thought to himself oh God I wish this would open and apparently the door opened and that was one of the first realizations they had that there was a psionic connection to the phenomenon Alex anymore I&#x27;m getting tired to be honest my voice is going no I was just about to say that I think it&#x27;s time for us to wrap up but I do want to remind everybody that they can watch the full special that aired on our website newsnow.com uh and let them know that I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be doing this again so if they have more questions uh just keep an eye out on uh our YouTube page news Nation reality check podcast and we&#x27;ll have more stuff like this coming up and by the way we will also be doing another special reality check just to annoy the government which clearly wants this issue to go away on the drones uh the drones that continue and never stopped buzzing New Jersey New York City and Washington DC I don&#x27;t know why the government&#x27;s claiming they&#x27;ve gone away but they sure as hell haven&#x27;t they&#x27;re still there talk soon</p>
