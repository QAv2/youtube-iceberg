            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up humans and welcome to a new happy Tuesday everybody. Okay, so as you can see I&#x27;m wearing my ugly Christmas sweater as every year you guys have been here for the ugly sweaters uh with me in previous years. So thank you for the support. I do want to uh talk about something that just happened today, which is that Dr. Jacqu Valet gave an interview to George Knapp and Jeremy Corbel unweaponized.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ve been waiting for this one because um I hadn&#x27;t seen Dr. Valet unweaponized yet, and I consider Dr. Valet and George two of the most important voices in in the phenomenon. Uh he was notoriously absent from Dan Farah&#x27;s age of disclosure documentary for example and that&#x27;s because I mean he&#x27;s Jack Valet he&#x27;s written books about the phenomenon even before my dad uh was a toddler you know so people should listen whenever he&#x27;s talking about this and you guys got to realize these types of scientists who have been in the thick of things we&#x27;re not going to have them forever and I think that many of them have done tremendous contributions to society even Dr. Valet is one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley essentially.</p>
<p>So he deserves all the praise that he gets and I was happy to uh find him on a weaponized episode because this is something that will remain for posterity and today in this episode he was very open unlike previous years where I&#x27;ve seen him be a little a little bit more cryptic. Just to give you an example, when he spoke to Joe Rogan, Rogan found it really difficult to talk to him because Jacques doesn&#x27;t open himself up to a lot of people. So now that he&#x27;s being a little bit more open, I know that he recently spoke about a contact experience that he had. And now um Dr. Valet is talking to Corbel and Nap about some more of the activity that has been going on within these groups like the BAS group uh the NITS group everything he was involved in because Dr.</p>
<p>Valet was involved in essentially uh researching UFOs for the government for many years through uh Robert Bigalow. He was one of the few people that was doing it out in the open. He was also part of project blue book with Dr. J. Ellen Hannik.</p>
<p>So whenever he speaks I think people should listen honestly. So this was an interesting one. I think that perhaps the most important part of the entire interview, although he spoke about a lot of different really interesting uh topics for me was he spoke about an alleged protocol that people from the government have to allegedly make contact with entities. Listen to what he has to say and then make up your own minds though. But just bear in mind, we&#x27;re talking about Dr.</p>
<p>Jacqu Valet here. We&#x27;re talking about the the author of Passport to Magonia. We&#x27;re talking about the probably the leading person in the invisible college. This guy is about to tell you the following. They certainly have uh spoken to people who were confronted with entities that were open to discussion.</p>
<p>Um there there are cases that I know uh where there were this happened in government facilities but nobody&#x27;s talking about that. So I suspect that that&#x27;s true based on the people I&#x27;ve met but uh they were not the people who are running the program. So I cannot be completely sure but what they described to me is a very sophisticated process by which we may be able to interact with the entities. Those are not the entities that are described um at Trrenite in in uh in you know in uh in in my book um uh with Pa Harris. Uh they are not the entities that were uh caught in Brazil.</p>
<p>um that that are you know in that documentary um they are they may be the controllers they may be the higher level entity they if if what I&#x27;m told is true the communication with them is very sophisticated and it&#x27;s complex so there may be a group that I would respect that has access to that and this was from years ago by the way. I mean that report of of that that particular interaction was more than 20 years in a in in a lab somewhere in control conditions. If that&#x27;s true then uh there is a process ongoing where we may be able to acquire information at a very sophisticated level and that would be you know that could be a reason for stalling quote disclosure until there can be a a rational way uh that we&#x27;re not confronted with something so uh overpowering that it would destroy our culture and our society. I mean we have enough to deal with with AI these days which is you know a foreign entity potentially. Um, &gt;&gt; but so, so you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;ve been made aware that there is a government project, maybe it was 20 years ago, that was able to establish direct communication with a nonhuman intelligence and that you believe this information to be true and that and that and and that this is a reality.</p>
<p>This is what you understand to be true. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Um, I cannot tell. Yes. Yes. Uh it it&#x27;s factual.</p>
<p>What I cannot tell is whether that the entity that was presented was a simulation of a real entity or whether it was the real entity. Okay. uh it that the the the people I spoke to couldn&#x27;t probe it uh to see if it was made of flesh or in metal or or or something else. Okay. But the it was presented to them in a secure facility that I&#x27;ve never heard of anywhere else where there was structured interaction with it on a continuing basis by specialists from different areas.</p>
<p>the the person I spoke to was an extreme, you know, specialist in in a particular discipline uh and uh not not the casual observer. And so that could be kind of one of the reasons we have to be careful or there&#x27;s a slow roll out of disclosure because you&#x27;re saying we might already have communication with some forms of communication or ways to engineer communication at a sophisticated level. I don&#x27;t think the the entities from Trinity, you know, were obviously scared. They were not the controllers of the craft. The the witness was still alive, you know, uh was become close friends with him went inside as a kid, you know, I mean was a very curious, very smart kid who knew his, as he says still today, I know my territory, you know, this is the land from his family.</p>
<p>He knows that ranch. He knows the cattle. He knows where the water is. He knows everything about it. And uh you know when he was inside there was essentially nothing except a very crude thing that we actually have which and we disagree about what it is but I I think it&#x27;s something that the soldiers that the military brought and they forgot to take it back but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a sophisticated we&#x27;ve tested it in the lab.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s what we spent over $10,000 testing it in Silicon Valley Labs and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just perfectly normal gadget. It&#x27;s not mysterious at all. So, uh, it may have been there just for the convenience of the soldiers doing work at night or whatever, but I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s part of the original of the original manufacturing equipment, you know, of whatever it was. Uh, the craft itself, we had very good description of it. By the way, the the the shape and the the You know the look and feel as as people say in Silicon Valley is identical to the one in Soro and it&#x27;s identical to the one in Valenc.</p>
<p>So we have three cases there. And what&#x27;s funny is when people uh were describing it in a newspaper and they they always hire an illustrator and the illustrator always draws a disc and none of those was a disc. It was eggshaped. &gt;&gt; Egg shaped. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The witnesses you know called it an avocado and they were obviously speaking Spanish and uh they you know they called it an avocado. It was not quite oval but it was an oval. Uh &gt;&gt; so I think that this uh distinction and the type of communication that Jacques is alluding to is a very important distinction to make and it is very important also for him to make that distinction that some of the beings from different cases are not the same ones that are attempting to communicate with uh people from the government because that&#x27;s what essentially Jock is saying that they the government or people from these programs have already found a protocol to try and communicate in different ways to something. He doesn&#x27;t know what it is really. I don&#x27;t think anybody knows exactly what we&#x27;re dealing with, but the fact that he&#x27;s now coming out saying that there is some sort of a protocol, this opens up the conversation quite a bit.</p>
<p>And as many people who claim to be contactees already believe, um I think that this is going to just keep happening. We&#x27;re going to keep having not new necessarily, but more open conversations about this. And I&#x27;m just really glad that it was somebody like Dr. Jacqu Valet, the one that came out and said it because it was needed uh to be said. This is not the kind of stuff that you&#x27;re going to listen to in films like for example the age of disclosure.</p>
<p>This is not the kind of stuff that uh people in Congress that are trying to get this done are going to tell you. This is the type of stuff that a scientist who&#x27;s been doing this his entire life would tell you and he&#x27;s telling it to you right now. So yeah, there is there seems to be some kind of a way that people are communicating with something. I don&#x27;t think anybody can be extremely descriptive with this the nature of this communication, but it it seems to exist. Uh there&#x27;s a lot of people constantly reporting it.</p>
<p>They have been reporting it for many generations. And it has different connotations depending on the times, depending on the place, depending on the upbringing of the person. It has very different interpretations and connotations. But the matter of fact is those communications seem to be happening and it&#x27;s really difficult to explain. And now that Dr.</p>
<p>Valet is being more open about this. I wonder what else is going to be discussed by more people that are equally if not um more qualified than Dr. Valet to talk about this. It&#x27;s a really really interesting one. Let me know what you think about this in the comment section down below.</p>
<p>The entire conversation is very interesting, but I found this one, this little part to be the most compelling for me. So, let me know what else jumped out to you. I&#x27;ll be reading in the comments. Before I leave, I do want to share something with you guys that um I&#x27;ve been thinking about for a while. And as you guys know, we do have a few merch t-shirts that were created that I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m going to try and start sending people.</p>
<p>I already told them that I was going to send them to them. And these are I&#x27;m going to try and sell them so I can get the money back for my friend James Landrith who uh made this investment all by himself. And I&#x27;m going to try and uh get the the investment back to him because I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t invest at all in any of this. This was just an idea that he had soakivo could get a lot more notoriety on contact in the desert just this year. But um he gave me the t-shirts back at the age of disclosure uh premiere.</p>
<p>He gave them to me and I&#x27;m gonna uh try and sell them uh physically to you guys. But the system is still getting into place. What I decided to do was that since I opened up Patreon, I explored the possibilities to have merch on Patreon and I found out that it is something that maybe uh saves me a lot of time and and it gets you physical uh rewards for rocking with me on Patreon. So, the way that they do it, and this is their mechanism, not mine, is that if you become a Patreon member, you have to pay for three months uh on Patreon. So, you can get one of the perks depending on the on the tier you&#x27;re on.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#x27;re on the five bucks tier, um I have something specifically for that tier, which is the sticker. And this is the sticker right here. If you That&#x27;s the way they set it up. is not me. I&#x27;m just letting you know.</p>
<p>Uh after the third payment uh of the Patreon uh membership, you get one of those sent to your house. Uh for the 10 bucks, uh you get this one, which is a print. Um for the 15 bucks, you get this one, which is a cup. Those uh designs are all made by my good friend uh Cole Watkins who does a lot of different designs for different creators like the Night Shift and like uh the Dreamland Motel and I don&#x27;t know where else he&#x27;s doing, but he does fantastic work. The idea is mine, but he&#x27;s the one who came up with this and I really like them.</p>
<p>This one is in Spanish, Muertz Diego Partos, and this one is in English, Eagle Deaths for Everyone. And I decided to use McKenna as a youngster because he was always talking about this. He doesn&#x27;t have that exact quote. This is a quote that is mine, but I always thought that he would make a quote like that. So that&#x27;s why I decided to do this.</p>
<p>And then Cole also um helped me set up which is the logo uh of the what&#x27;s up humans greeting at the beginning. And this is the t-shirt that people who pay for the $20 tier are going to get after three months of being part of Patreon. Uh, and the 25 bucks tier is going to be this little bag with the ego death for everyone uh on the Barbie logo kind of style. Also made by Cole Watkins. So, that&#x27;s the first collection that uh I&#x27;m gonna be putting out, but I decided to do it through Patreon because I don&#x27;t really have a lot of time on my hands right now.</p>
<p>Unlike other big channels, I don&#x27;t have a whole team behind me. It&#x27;s just me. So, and I got to do live and everything else. So, it it&#x27;s become more difficult for me to try and do this all on my own and try to put out merch and all that stuff. I am still going to do like a more a manual system on my own.</p>
<p>Uh but for now, I think that this is a good idea. So, if you guys want some merch, I think the Patreon is the way to go if if you ask me. But let me know what you think about this. Let me know what you think about Dr. Jacqu Valet uh saying that there is an established protocol of communication with entities.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s pretty wild. and they talked about a lot of different things. So, let me know what you think about it in the comment section down below. I&#x27;ll be reading everything. If you like the content you see, I&#x27;m going to ask you to like, share, hype, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell icon.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all you need to do in order to help us and it is what helps us the most. So, thank you. But if you want to support us in other ways, there&#x27;s a few links down there you can choose from. You can also become a member on YouTube. You can also become a member on Patreon.</p>
<p>you now have a good reason probably to become a Patreon member alongside all of this which I think is not a bad choice if you ask me. So, uh you can also support us through KG. If you don&#x27;t want any of those other options, you can do that. Anything you choose to do is always very appreciated. So, thank you.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it for me today on this video, but I&#x27;ll see you guys in the next one. Remember, stay curious and inquisitive like Dr. Jac valet always. Bye. Seoactive.</p>
