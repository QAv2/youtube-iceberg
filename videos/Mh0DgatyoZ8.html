            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>All right, here we go. Dr. Steven Greer, welcome back. Famed researcher and retired emergency medical doctor who now heads a disclosure project and focuses on ending the secrecy around UFOs and UAPs. Welcome back to Vlad TV.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. Great to be here with you. &gt;&gt; This is actually the first time we&#x27;re face to face. &gt;&gt; I know. It&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been wanting to meet you for a long time. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Know the last time we did it remotely, but I had to get in the same room with you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Here we are.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m glad you could come, too. &gt;&gt; Well, a lot has happened since last time. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. &gt;&gt; So, Trump created a new task force that&#x27;s focused on declassifying federal secrets, including UFOs. &gt;&gt; And Representative Anna Luna is heading up this task force, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um, have they released anything so far? &gt;&gt; Uh, no.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m not sure that Trump created that. That&#x27;s been organized under the House Oversight Committee. Now, President Trump is wanting to declassify a number of documents uh and information and there&#x27;s everything is still under review from the White House point of view. The House Oversight Committee because I personally have met with uh Miss Luna and Burchette and and had conversations with Representative Moscowitz and others. Um they&#x27;re have a task force that has a number of objectives.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not only UAPs, other issues. Uh, I think the big problem I&#x27;ve seen in dealing with them for the last two or three years or so, is that there&#x27;s not a select committee with subpoena power, which they have to get and been blocked by some of the bad actors in the Congress. And number two, they h don&#x27;t have the funding for a specialized staff. So, you need a staff of people who can become expert in this area. And if not, you&#x27;re not going to be able to know anything.</p>
<p>So my experience there is that we&#x27;ll go in with briefing materials that&#x27;s dispositive evidence and proof and firsthand witnesses. Other people who are professional military and intelligence disinformation operatives go in and then gaslight them in another direction. So they you for the most part these people in Congress mean well but they don&#x27;t know where the washroom is. They don&#x27;t even know where the landscape is put out. So, and I [clears throat] don&#x27;t see that changing.</p>
<p>I know three years ago when I was brought into the Senate Intelligence Committee, skiff, the secure compartmented information facility where you do exchange sensitive and top secret information. Those guys who were at the top of Senate Intelligence and Armed Services investigating this hadn&#x27;t gotten not gotten anywhere, but the lead guy was told you can spend 10 or 20% of your time on this. But his portfolio was oversight of CIA, NSA, National Reconnaissance Office that runs all the secret spy satellites. I mean, come on. You know, you need a staff, 20, 30 people who drill down on all these the evidence and get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>So, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not muscled up to the extent it has to be. So, what I say is that there they have two pathways here. they either get it done right or at least they open up their inquiry to firthand whistleblowers like Mr. Barber and not bring in people who are second, third, and fourth hand, don&#x27;t know anything. Right? So the hearing they had last a few months ago in the house, there was no one there who knew anything about the subject.</p>
<p>They were all secondhand, thirdand speculative um people who had been with NASA but didn&#x27;t know anything. I I know knew a number of them and I&#x27;m going why are these people testifying? You know, you want someone who&#x27;s actually handled the craft, handled the bodies, been uh operational on a retrieval team. Um or even like Mr. Herrera who came across this thing and almost lost his life by these thugs who said, &quot;Look, you know, you know, we&#x27;re mention this, you&#x27;re dead.&quot; So now, those are the people who need to be sworn in under oath. Uh now the reason I say we have to have subpoena power is that if it&#x27;s in the Congress they can&#x27;t force someone to come in right without a subpoena.</p>
<p>They can invite people but the really high value targets that I have on my list they got to be subpoenaed and then if they lie under oath to Congress they got a problem. Now, the other pathway which I think is more viable would require executive orders from the president and that would be under the executive branch and law enforcement. And law enforcement can compel without a subpoena. You know, if you&#x27;re brought in by a federal agent and and asked about something and you lie, it&#x27;s a felony. Point blank.</p>
<p>So the the the more efficient way to do this in my opinion would be that the House and the Senate to investigate this refer it to DOJ because it&#x27;s criminal activity. We can prove that and then DOJ assigns to whatever divisions people to go out and and do a proper investigation and pull people in and interrogate them and if necessary uh get warrants. no knock warrants to move into corporate locations and secret facilities that that I have locations for and they retrieve the evidence and proof. So, that is something that could happen tonight if if we could get uh executive orders from the president to do it. So, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re recommending.</p>
<p>There are five executive orders we&#x27;ve given to them and we&#x27;ll see what happens in the next, you know, few weeks. Well, Cash Patel, the new FBI director, &gt;&gt; he&#x27;s been vocal about exposing UFO secrets and so forth. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s your take on this? &gt;&gt; Yes, he has, but he&#x27;s been gas lit by Lou Alzando and other people that are professional disinformation operatives. So, here&#x27;s where you get into a big problem. Um, when you have people who are very well trained to tell part information and part misinformation or disinformation and you&#x27;re not someone who&#x27;s an expert in the area, it&#x27;s so easy to gaslight them in the wrong way.</p>
<p>for example, consistently the sort of the nexus of folks doing that uh Lou Alzando and Chris Melon and you know people like Jim Semian and others they&#x27;ll say well they&#x27;re a threat. We&#x27;re trying to imply the aliens are some kind of threat. Well, they want people to believe that because they get more money for the military-industrial complex. It&#x27;s a hoax. But the other thing they&#x27;ll say is we don&#x27;t have anything that flies like that.</p>
<p>Oh, really? Yeah, we do. And we have had since the 50s, literally since the 50s. So then you ask the question, if you put some real information, you know, this is why I call it the poison pill. So on the outside of this poison pill of disinformation is the sweet truth of some facts and evidence, but inside the messaging, the narrative is a total disinformation narrative designed to move them off the path of finding what the real truth is. And I will tell you the bigger secret here is not about extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s about the fact that there&#x27;s a covert illegal operation, unconstitutional, that have technologies that can, as I&#x27;m quoting Admiral Wilson, the head of intelligence joint staff that I briefed, can do circles around our B2 stealth bomber, circles around it. So, and those are human. So, that is a threat to the US Constitution because of how they&#x27;re operating, but it&#x27;s also a a strategic threat. And those assets are operating all over the world. We know they&#x27;re in China, they&#x27;re in Russia, they&#x27;re in the Middle East.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve been one was downed in Iran that we had to retrieve. We have this from a ring beret source who&#x27;s read into that operation. So, you know, what I tell people is that that&#x27;s the part of it they don&#x27;t want the president and Congress and the American people to know because that&#x27;s the that is the lynch pin in being able to hoax an alien invasion or hoax an alien threat, right? And that is the 70-year plan. We&#x27;re getting to the very end, a crescendo of a plan that was concocted by a bunch of psychopaths and sociopaths in 1953-54 to eventually, as Verer von Brown, who invented the rocket of Adolf Hitler said, create an alien threat to unite the world around sort of a dystopic uh totalitarian militaristic situation. And we&#x27;re right there, Vlad, we are right at that happening.</p>
<p>And so what&#x27;s really worries me and keeps me up at night. I&#x27;ll be very blunt is that I don&#x27;t see yet the bandwidth in Congress or in the White House yet to comprehend the vastness of this problem and how to discern the information from the disinformation. And in order to do that, they&#x27;re going to have to pull in people like Mr. Barber and and Don Paul and these people I know them who have handled both ends of this. they&#x27;ve handled the man-made and they&#x27;ve handled the ones that are uh you know nonhuman and so they and that has to be unpacked.</p>
<p>Instead, they&#x27;re listening to people and saying, &quot;Oh, well, don&#x27;t look behind this curtain, right?&quot; So, I liken this organization keeping the secret to the Wizard of Oz, you know, and it&#x27;s this old crud mud and back there pulling levers scaling the hell out of Darthy and scaring the scarecrow and all that. And and and they&#x27;re very good at what they&#x27;re doing. And because there&#x27;s not a professional staffing right now looking at this either in the White House or Congress, they&#x27;re susceptible to that. And and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s you know, a little I&#x27;ve said to people very high up in Congress and the administration, a little knowledge on this is a very dangerous thing. Extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t want dilotants in there. I mean, this whole concept of creating a fake alien invasion to take control of the world, it&#x27;s been it&#x27;s been floating around. There&#x27;s something called Project Blue Beam. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Uh and more recently, I remember there was a comic book I read that later on became a movie in a series called The Watchmen.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. where in essentially the the premise of the comic book was that, you know, in an alterate, you know, reality, America and Russia are about to launch nuclear missiles at each other and one of these guys, you know, um, Aussie Mandias basically drops a fake alien in the middle of Time Square that kills thousands of people and suddenly everyone unites and America and Russia are best friends. &gt;&gt; Well, the best theme for that was Independence Day, the movie, right? That as well, right? That&#x27;s the one that was really the hallmark and that was right out of CIA SCOP, psychological warfare scripting because it was like the whole world united around fighting the alien threat. Now obviously, you know, it&#x27;s a sexy movie line. You know, it works in Hollywood here.</p>
<p>You know, we&#x27;re, you know, you can be as dumb as you want to be and make a$2 billion dollar movie, right? But don&#x27;t quote me on that. Let me take that out. But um True. But the but You know, it&#x27;s like that that comic Ken Kenworthy or whatever. I can&#x27;t fix stupid.</p>
<p>But um [laughter] so but we have a situation where that narrative has already happened. Here&#x27;s the litmus test for this. When I was first starting to do this uh in my spare time as a emergency doctor, it came out that I was in involved with I think it was I&#x27;d been on Larry King Live back in &#x27;94 or something like that. And my kid, my youngest daughter&#x27;s uh school teacher wanted me to give a talk and these are first graders in North Carolina in Asheville, North Carolina. and they wanted to have a, you know, have me come in and present on this.</p>
<p>Now, you have to remember this was my daughter was six years old. She&#x27;s 36 now. So, it&#x27;s 30 years ago. And the first question out of the mouth of a babe was, &quot;Yeah, but Dr. Greer, aren&#x27;t you afraid that if you go out, you&#x27;ll be abducted by the aliens?&quot; Now, this is a first grader in North Carolina 30 years ago.</p>
<p>And at that point, I went boom, scops have reached saturation. that between movies and uh entertainment and the ufology mythology, everyone thinks that&#x27;s going on when it&#x27;s a CIA scop. All right. I knew that in the early 90s. I didn&#x27;t know it until probably 92 93.</p>
<p>And then I had men who were operational who had been on man-made UFOs using strange robotic grays and other creatures to abduct people for the psychological warfare value but also to cover up some real event. So sometimes there would be an actual ET event or an experimental aircraft of ours that looked like a UFO and people would have seen it and what they would do is create this fake alien abduction. Same thing with the cattle mutilations. That&#x27;s what those are. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ve known this for a long time now. That&#x27;s not the conventional wisdom. It&#x27;s certainly not what someone like Lou Alzando and those folks would go in and say. They say, &quot;Oh, no. That&#x27;s what the aliens are doing.&quot; And they know damn good and well.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s it&#x27;s all a scop. &gt;&gt; I think the biggest news in this world was the Jake Barber interview. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. I&#x27;ve been working with Mr. Barber for a couple of years and knew about his uh operations.</p>
<p>Very little of what he did and knows has come out yet. Um very very little, but that&#x27;s for reasons we can get into. Okay. So Jake Barber is a Air Force vet and a lot of the the focus on the story was this egg-shaped craft. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That he actually came in contact with. Mhm. &gt;&gt; This is not someone that was investigating things and so forth. This was actually a first person encounter with some sort of craft. &gt;&gt; No, he was on the retrieval teams officially.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Out of uh Delta Force. And th that team I I I&#x27;ll let him say where they operate from. I&#x27;ve been there. They are a team that are uh contracted to uh participate in operations to down and retrieve extraterrestrial vehicles or NHI craft.</p>
<p>So that is what he and his team did. Uh he was in charge of security and transport for those special operations uh out at a couple of black sites out in the desert. and uh I&#x27;ve been to these sites and uh so I can speak to you know more detail about that but that is actually what he did. It was not an incidental encounter. He he&#x27;s was operational for about 20 years at a couple of these sites that where that&#x27;s going on and you know we&#x27;ve been I&#x27;ve known of those sites since the early 90s since before he arrived.</p>
<p>And so his operations uh go back quite some time there. So he&#x27;s he became fairly senior uh over the years and and he&#x27;s went from being in the military to then working being set up in a corporate entity that contracted um and would sort of work with government and aerospace companies to acquire those craft and then get them downed and then retrieve them so they could be handed over to be studied uh or reverse engineered. So it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a very long and complex story only part of which is going to come out you know immediately. We plan the rest of this year next year it&#x27;ll all come out. &gt;&gt; So this particular egg spaceship I guess &gt;&gt; is this extraterrestrial? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Or or is it reverse engineered? &gt;&gt; No, that one was a ET origin. So um the you know interestingly he he and I talk about this at some length right now unless you&#x27;re very expert in this area. You&#x27;re not going to be able to distinguish between a non-human one and a reverse engineered one from Lockheed or Northrup unless you know what to look for. And even then the the science of of studying those technologies and aircraft from other places that has been going on for 80 years literally 80 years. So 45 to now.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s been this, you know, it started out like this, very slow, and then it boom broke out back around the mid to late 50s forward. It was a huge breakout in in how those technologies operate. And uh people are shocked when I tell them, you know, I have an intel source who is the top scientist at the Naval Research Labs in Washington. It&#x27;s the largest Department of Defense lab. He was in the vault, as it&#x27;s called, where a lot of classified things are kept on this subject.</p>
<p>and he saw that it was uh October 19 54 that we mastered gravity control. So now imagine you&#x27;ve mastered gravity control. We were fooling around with it prior to but you mastered it by then. Now 54 to now 70 years. So imagine a 70-year technology curve with the brightest minds, scientific minds in the world recruited high school, college into those programs.</p>
<p>um and virtually unlimited black budget funding, right? Trillions of dollars. So that what is being flown out there would deceive the president, Senate Intelligence Committee, and this is the problem. So he had he and I have talked about this. So so Jake Barber and I have had these long discussions where even for people expert people like his team, often it&#x27;s very hard to distinguish between one and the other. But this particular object is an egg-shaped object.</p>
<p>Um, those have been reported for a very long time. Now, do we have knockoffs that look similar? Yes. So, any any shape that you would see that was non-human, we&#x27;ve sort of done a copycat and that&#x27;s for a false flag operations. So, you know, the public won&#x27;t know is it real. It&#x27;s like the old uh years ago when there used to be audio tape.</p>
<p>Is it real or is it memorex? Remember that commercial? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is it real or is it memorex? Is it is it is it a an original that&#x27;s non-human extraterrestrial or is it something that has been uh a faximile uh that&#x27;s been reproduced and and would pretty much fool anyone who&#x27;s not quite expert in the area and and I think in the last 30 years since I&#x27;ve been doing this the the refinement of that technology at almost where if you look at uh Michael Herrera&#x27;s testimony the marine who encountered one of these man-made ones in Indonesia Asia. Uh, it was so advanced, but then there&#x27;s you could tell if you got close to it, it had seams and parts. It was man-made. It&#x27;s a Lockheed platform.</p>
<p>Ones that you see that are triangular, there are ones that are extraterrestrial that are triangular. Most of the ones people see are are my uncle&#x27;s old company, North Grumman, or um the uh Rathon platforms that are triangular. Uh typically the RAON ones are a little less equilateral. They&#x27;re a little more uh elongated. Um and those if you look at Steven DNA&#x27;s testimony, it&#x27;s up on our site and we actually have it in our new book that just came out.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to show you in a minute. Uh that was at a level where it was almost had an a living component. So we went up and touched it. It kind of purred, reacted. If you look at his testimony, he was out here in California at at uh Fort Irwin in 2000 and that was a Rathon device.</p>
<p>And I would say out of a million people, all million people would think that was extraterrestrial and it wasn&#x27;t. He subsequently he and his wife were abducted into it and tortured. But um you know this the other part of this whole story that no one gets. I mean you know the ufology you all the abductions and mutilations. I say, &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;ve debriefed about two dozen guys who&#x27;ve been operational in those programs doing that.&quot; So, you know, I&#x27;m sorry if you&#x27;re gullible, but wake the up.</p>
<p>Excuse my language, but uh that that ain&#x27;t happening by the ETSs. Um, so most of the information on this is actually part information spun in with disinformation. And this is one of the real problems. And the reason I think it&#x27;s important to bring this up is that when you&#x27;re on these retrieval teams like Jake was on, some of them are at a high enough level, they&#x27;re only retrieving uh uh you know, weird things like if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re on a retrieval team and you have a B2 stealth go down, okay, that is one level of clearance, but it&#x27;s another world when you start retrieving the man-made UFOs and the ET things and so you get cleared slowly into that level. And I have a number of folks that we&#x27;re working with who uh had that same trajectory.</p>
<p>They started out very young retrieving, you know, a crashed jet, air force jet or something that had classified components on it. They all do sensors and things like that. Be sure they don&#x27;t fall into enemy hands. But then certain people then get cleared into this other level of exotics or what&#x27;s euphemistically called at advanced technologies. Um but uh but super advanced exotic technologies.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, Jake Barber said that he could actually summon this egg ship with his mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s not quite that simple. Um it&#x27;s you know as you know in 1990 I started um the whole C5 contact initiative &gt;&gt; using consciousness interfacing with extraterrestrial sensors. So, what people don&#x27;t realize and they don&#x27;t think about it is that you&#x27;re not going to be able to communicate with a radio frequency like your phone across the vastness of space because it would at the speed of light which is the speed of a radio frequency to communicate to the Andromeda galaxy which is 2 and a half million lighty years from here. It&#x27;d take you two and a half million years to get that signal there and another two and a half million years for the person to answer your call.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Not going to happen. So when you&#x27;re dealing with this is where you get into strange stuff, right? And the CIA people call it WSFM. Stands for weird science and freaking magic. That&#x27;s literally what they call it. And my uncle&#x27;s old company, I met an engineer, worked on this weird stuff, and he oh we just call it PFM, pure magic.</p>
<p>Excuse my language, but I mean that&#x27;s what they call it. And the really high-end engineers in aerospace. So um those technologies are the heart of the one of the central things of the secrecy cuz I accidentally stumbled across that when I was 18 when I had a contact experience and uh realized that those communication systems and those civilizations are interfacing with not just random thought and consciousness but in a state of more expanded awareness and coherent thought like very like a laser like your thoughts are boom. They pick up on that at the speed of thought which is instantaneous because the conscious field is actually omnipresent. It&#x27;s the ultimate quantum entangled field meaning that every point in space and time is integrated into it and there&#x27;s no latency in time instant.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So you&#x27;re saying thought is faster than light. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, it&#x27;s instantaneous. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; And what is a quant of thought? Can that be quantified? Yes, it has been and it is. So the covert programs mirrored what we were doing for peaceful contact into a program they call P3 psionic um operators where they would find people and put them through a program training them so that they could become basically biological machines and it was brutal.</p>
<p>Most of them died ended up in comas. Uh but the ones that survived became adept at being able to do that but in for a hostile reason. They weren&#x27;t doing it. The C5 contact I mean people anyone can do it. You can get the app C5 contact app is on all the stores.</p>
<p>You can learn to do this and it&#x27;s for making peaceful contact. The [snorts] aerospace industry and intelligence community said wow let&#x27;s take this and turn it into a weapon system. So what they did was train people to do that with pretty good reliability, lock on to an extraterrestrial, say guidance system, kind of slip in there, move it into range and hit it with an electromagnetic pulse weapon, knock it out of the sky, opposite of what our purpose is. My purpose is to make peaceful contact and stop all that fighting. But the uh intelligence community, you know, realized this a long time ago.</p>
<p>I understand in the 50s uh they realized that the technologies related to extraterrestrial craft and occupants were very much tied into uh that field of consciousness. So, one of the problems that you we&#x27;re having with science right now is that everyone&#x27;s sort of stuck in the flat earth society, you know, because no one&#x27;s caught up to the 50s yet, classified technologies. And so, when he brought this out, people went, gosh, well, that&#x27;s what Dr. Ver had been saying for 35 years. And uh but I knew it was operational.</p>
<p>I mean, remember, there are a lot of people on my team who are uh they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re former CIA remote view folks, and you know, there&#x27;s a 30-year program where the CIA used people like Ingo Swan, who&#x27;s passed away, a great guy, who would use consciousness to spy on the Soviet Union or image something out in space, and they were actually incredibly accurate. Uh so I think that&#x27;s one of the things when you go from an understanding of the science of consciousness into applied physics let&#x27;s call it um with communication but also targeting these objects. That&#x27;s the really spooky end of it that it&#x27;s very upsetting when people unpack the fact that it&#x27;s not science fiction and it&#x27;s real. Well, one of the things that Jake mentioned is that he was actually able to control this this ship with his mind using psionics and he talked about how it differed based on the situation. Like there&#x27;s a whole fight orflight aspect to how well he could control it.</p>
<p>Do you understand that part and can you explain it? &gt;&gt; Well, what he was referring to, I don&#x27;t think it was referring to him being the operator, but the the ones that are P3 operators. So, let&#x27;s get clear on that one. number one and that the P3 operators are put into a training program. It&#x27;s rather brutal, but it does involve drugs, dopamine, uh electromagnetic systems. A great many of them end up in a coma or end up dying.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s very brutal. But one of the stimulants that heightens your awareness is is in a a moment if they can induce a frightened heightened state, you know, situational awareness like uh the the whole fight orflight uh dynamic. Um now certainly in a meditative state, you don&#x27;t need that to get to a higher state, but remember this is the mindset of a military program. Boom, get it done, right? Uh, so it&#x27;s hardly the integrative program of a meditative training like I teach, but it&#x27;s like get her done by any means. And so if some people get killed being experimental guinea pigs in this, too bad.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s collateral damage. So he&#x27;s talking about how when you&#x27;re in a moment where you&#x27;re uh in a in a fight orflight situation, you all your senses and your consciousness gets very focused, right? So it it has it&#x27;s an augmentation process that can be induced. Uh and of course you know I don&#x27;t recommend it. It&#x27;s a terrible thing to do to fellow human beings in my opinion. But that is why um so there are many pathways to getting into that ability and there are ones some of which are very positive and great experience for everyone and some of which are brutal which you would expect a hardcore military program run by sociopaths &gt;&gt; that just want to get something done, right? And and you know, hey, if there&#x27;s collateral damage and people get killed or injured or commit suicide or whatever, who cares, right? It&#x27;s sort of like when the head of army int the army intelligence guy, General Steelbine, took his boys through uh some training uh programs for consciousness and being a remote view and a huge percentage of them committed suicide and and started doing drugs and became alcoholics and had mental breakdowns because they weren&#x27;t doing it in an integrated way where they were unfolding naturally within.</p>
<p>It was a very technologically oriented oriented brutal get it done way. So you can get that result, right? I mean, if the goal is by any means necessary, get this done, right? You can do it, but look at the human cost. So I tell people this is not wise, nor is it humane, but that is an accurate description what he said of what they were doing. Um, I have more information on those programs. Uh, and we have other people who&#x27;ve been operators in them.</p>
<p>Um and uh you know it&#x27;s said there even the way they recruit and bring the people in you know this is the part where you know the whistleblower uh Michael Herrera who saw that operation in Indonesia is this huge 300t diameter uh octagonal craft and underneath it was a platform and there were crates and he initially when we last did our interview I just was getting ready to do the national press club event about a year and a half ago and Michael Herrera didn&#x27;t know that in those crates were humans being trapped moved around. He thought it was drugs or something, but there were little portable oxygen and HVAC units on it. And so those people were people who were um going to either die or starve to death after that tsunami in Indonesia in 2009. And they said, &quot;Hey,&quot; they went up, these special operations guys went up and said, &quot;Look, you can either stay here and die or you can come with us and you&#x27;ll live for now.&quot; And then they would move them into these operations and and screen them to be beat P3 operators. And the P3 operators, psionic operators, um most of those people didn&#x27;t pass the testing.</p>
<p>Uh but the ones who did then went into this more brutal program. The ones who didn&#x27;t would work in stiffs subterranean facilities or underground bases. Uh you know cooking and cleaning and doing other things. So u it&#x27;s a rather disturbing you know uh operation from start to finish. Although once they&#x27;re there in custody let&#x27;s say &gt;&gt; um they&#x27;re apparently treated quite well.</p>
<p>But of course, it&#x27;s like an indentured servitude in my mind. I mean, you you know, people can put whatever lipstick on that pig. To me, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s trafficking in desperate people and and and then using them for your own devices. &gt;&gt; Well, you mentioned uh Lewis Alzando a few times. So, there was a second congressional meeting that happened in I think November of 2024 &gt;&gt; and Lewis Alzando was one of the four experts that spoke on this.</p>
<p>What exactly is your issue with Lewis? I well I have I don&#x27;t know him and I have no animist towards him personally at all. I just know that the top CIA guy in the last 40 years uh who&#x27;s advises us who&#x27;s very clandestine immediately when he surface said this is the master of disinformation and these are the things he&#x27;s going to be saying that are false. So what I tell people, I don&#x27;t have a problem with anybody, but I have a problem with someone deliberately providing false information to noviceses, people who are just trying to investigate this with the best of intentions like Miss Luna and others, and they are being gaslit and deceived. That&#x27;s my problem. But my bigger problem is that what is the agenda of that deception? The agenda of the deception is to get people on the side of an alien threat to supports the same cabal that&#x27;s been keeping the secret, right? And at the same time present something that would be much more terrifying than 9/11 or CO and try to seize control of of people&#x27;s freedoms under this, you know, sort of ruse of a threat from outer space.</p>
<p>So long before I got on the stage doing this, I think that had already been baked into the cake because they started abducting people and doing cattle mutilations in the late 50s and 60s. The first mutilated animal was a horse named Snippy. And the doctor who was called in on that hematologist pathologist from uh Denver was a very good friend of mine. And I went out to his home and he says that was absolutely a covert human operation. But of course then you get people who write books like Linda Mutenhow, an alien harvest and they&#x27;re harvesting body parts.</p>
<p>Yeah, they are. But it&#x27;s not ETSs. It&#x27;s a covert human program. &gt;&gt; So I think the hardest thing, you know, that for that I&#x27;ve had to deal with and I was warned about this in 1991 by an old CIA hand, a different guy. He was a character.</p>
<p>He was like this chain smoking looked like the cigarette man in XFiles and um long hair and and he said, &quot;Look, the truth about this is so much stranger than the fiction uologists believe and that the public believe. Um and it&#x27;s going to be the hardest thing and it&#x27;s so strange it covers itself. So, and if you expose the truth, you will discredit yourself because no one wants to hear that truth. They want to hear the narrative we&#x27;ve been selling since the 50s. And that&#x27;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s a very frustrating situation. And so my problem with anyone in this field is that if they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about, they should be quiet. If they do know what they&#x27;re talking about and they&#x27;re spreading disinformation and covering up some of the facts of this, then I have a real problem with them. And I will call them out. Um, I&#x27;d call out anyone who would go in that direction, whether it&#x27;s the president of the United States or whoever it is, because you cannot let this happen.</p>
<p>If if this happens, we&#x27;d be looking at a cat catastrophic global situation. &gt;&gt; Well, have you spoken to Trump personally about this? &gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t comment on the people I&#x27;m meeting with intimately right now. I &gt;&gt; can neither confirm nor deny it. No, but I&#x27;ll just say that there there are really good people around him, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; that are uh trying to find out about this seriously um and sincerely and I think there&#x27;s very promising to me they&#x27;re very promising developments if they can if they can stay uh on track with getting the information and not be gaslit by the disinformation because for every person that will go in and give them the truth of what&#x27;s going on like Mr. Barber or Herrera, there&#x27;ll be 10 that are actually counter intelligence and disinformation people gaslighting them.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s the problem. And and how do you have the discern? Here&#x27;s the problem. Very busy people, right? I&#x27;m busy as hell. I go seven days a week, 20 hours a day at this point. But if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re the president or the chairman of Senate Intelligence or whatever it is, you&#x27;ve got hundred things a day you got to deal with, you have to have some people who are experts who are trusted who can drill down on this and unpack it because it&#x27;s too it&#x27;s way more complicated than anyone realizes.</p>
<p>Uh I mean let&#x27;s let&#x27;s take an example of this. I mean how how how uh wacky and complicated it is. Um, you have one of the most famous UFO cases in history, Cash Landram, right? You know that case, those of you who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s in this book that just came out. We&#x27;ll go through that in a minute. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And it was considered a near crash retrieval operation in outside Houston, north of Houston. And there were three people, a little boy, 5-year-old boy, and his mom and his aunt, driving along a highway. And this UFO comes out, descends out of the sky, very unstable, and all kinds of stuff coming out of it. And they were slathered in radioactive waste and they suffered severe radioactive radiation poisoning, had to be hospitalized. Um, and that whole area was was sprayed.</p>
<p>They had to dig up and redo that road twice because of the amount of radiation. I still think there&#x27;s a ton of it out there. Now, that was in the I think early 80s, mid 80s, something like that. I 40 years ago. What that actually was, now of course UFO subculture that aliens radiated the poor little boy.</p>
<p>Well, not so fast. So, we have an Air Force intelligence guy who is the principal investigator of that event that we have debriefed and we have his testimony. And that was an ET craft that they were studying. They could not get the uh energy system to work. So, they foolishly put on a portable nuclear power plant on it to get it going.</p>
<p>And it was headed east out of Nevada and was headed east and it malfunctioned. It had a filter, some kind of circulatory filter system that ruptured and started spewing all this radioactive waste and that was and it was there were four human pilots on it trying to learn how this thing operated, but it was a nonhuman craft. Yes, but the energy system and the pilots were humans trying to figure out how the thing worked. So, this was one of these things that went bad. Now, you can imagine Air Force intelligence and others would love to have people think, &quot;Oh, well, that was, you know, the aliens did that to those poor people.&quot; That that&#x27;s one example of which there are thousands.</p>
<p>So, when they screw up like that, they&#x27;re going to be happy to say, &quot;Oh, the aliens did it.&quot; It&#x27;s like if somebody farts and there&#x27;s a baby in the room, oh, the baby farted. Right? [laughter] So, sorry to be so crass, but you know, the fact is that happens all the time in this subject. who you have to go to firsthand sources like in this case we have the testimony of the PI the principal investigator of that event now that takes a lot of work you know if you&#x27;re just sort of a hobbyist on this or you&#x27;re someone in Congress who has two hours a week or no two hours a month to drill down on this you&#x27;re going to be in a lot of trouble very quickly misinterpreting things so I think we have to the people have to insist you&#x27;re going to do this. It&#x27;s a big story, biggest story in human history, frankly, and a huge national security issue. Got to do it right.</p>
<p>You cannot do it halfway. Now, Congress so far doesn&#x27;t have the tools to do that. They almost got them a little over a year ago. And there was the, you know, the Senate passed a great bill that would have had an amnesty safe harbor period for these whistleblowers we have. And you know I have 760 plus whistleblowers.</p>
<p>[sighs] But we went over to the house for reconciliation. It was part of the defense funding bill. The National Defense Authorization Act. It was called NDAA. It went out of the provisions for amnesty or safe harbor were unanimously passed out of Senate Intelligence.</p>
<p>And I actually helped with the folks who were putting that together quietly behind the scenes writing it. And so it then went over to the House, passed the Senate uni, not unanimously, but overwhelmingly went to the House and there were some people who killed it, you know, and there was, you know, Congressman Turner of the House Intelligence Committee and and Mike Rogers of of the uh Armed Services Committee in the House and some other people killed that thing, ripped those provisions out and stripped it of anything meaningful. So we then concluded and I told Jake and other people who are see a lot of the guys I&#x27;ve been working with are sitting in the wings waiting for something to happen that protects them. They need legal protections because many of them have been in operations that are illegal. They need physical protection because there are wet works or assassination targeted killings that have been authorized against people.</p>
<p>And I know he has had someone on his team killed. I&#x27;ve had people on my team killed over the years. So until that happens, you&#x27;re out here naked. We&#x27;re uncovered. Very dangerous.</p>
<p>So for people to expect all this to get dealt with, but gee, the government doesn&#x27;t, they haven&#x27;t even figured out that there was lethal force used against highv value whistleblowers until that kind of gets through the Congress or an executive order. The president could do this with a stroke of pen. No question. Absolutely. president has the power to authorize full investigation and DOJ to provide immunity or amnesty transa in other words they&#x27;d have to come clean on everything right but that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re recommending because there are some very high value w whistleblowers who&#x27;ve approached us who who want to do it but right now there&#x27;s no we&#x27;re not protecting them and these people are patriotic like Jake and his guys are very patriotic Well, outside of Lewis Alzando, other people actually spoke at this uh second congressional meeting.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um, one of which was Michael Shelonburgger. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh, who&#x27;s an independent journalist and he claims that informing gave him a secret 12-page document &gt;&gt; that went over Immaculate Constellation, which is reverse engineering of UFOs. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, can you explain this? &gt;&gt; Well, that that was one compartmented code name, right? that that he had information on. He wasn&#x27;t involved in those projects. I would say what you want to do is go from there to getting full investigatory powers to drill down on who was doing the rever. We know where they are and and what kind of data ended up getting, you know, retrieved. So yes, I mean that&#x27;s fine, but again it wasn&#x27;t someone who was directly boots on the ground uh scientist handling the material uh etc.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s what we would want and uh I think the other gentleman, Mr. Gold, uh just has looked into it just right casually. Um &gt;&gt; you had Michael Gold, a former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnership and also a member of NASA&#x27;s UAP independent study team. &gt;&gt; So he testified as well. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>But he didn&#x27;t know anything. Okay. I mean, and and I met with him privately and and you know, he admitted that they basically closed that task force because they didn&#x27;t have people that had were staffed to go out and gather all this information. So, uh, what good does that? So why do you know this is the other thing I said to Bett why do you have Congressman Burchchett why do you want people here who admit they don&#x27;t have anything when I have I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve told you that there are all these people who will go up there today who handle the materials there&#x27;s something not right with this picture I&#x27;m I&#x27;m calling them out right now and I haven&#x27;t done this yet is that get serious or go home right but somebody needs to get serious about this because I think all this is going to come out in the next year or two and when it does, it&#x27;s got to come out properly. You know, one person very close to the intelligence community told me after the election, he said, &quot;If this comes out the way it&#x27;s being directed now, it&#x27;ll be a thousand times worse than COVID.</p>
<p>It&#x27;d be a global catastrophe.&quot; So, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a thousand ways this goes wrong. there&#x27;s one way that it can go out come out correctly and not end up in panic and you know false wars and and all kinds of problems. Um and it has to be very seriously looked at by some people who with the acumen and expertise to know you know what&#x27;s the strategic pathway out of this mess. And I think one of them is there are a lot of people in these covert programs really want to come forward. They do.</p>
<p>Just like there are a whole bunch of people like that, but there&#x27;s not a path for them now yet that&#x27;s safe. &gt;&gt; Well, the other person that was at this hearing uh was Tim uh Galudet. &gt;&gt; Galaudet. &gt;&gt; Galaudet, right? Who was a retired rear admiral with the US Navy. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now, is this someone who knew what they were talking about? &gt;&gt; My understanding is that he&#x27;s also sort of an operative. Okay. Yeah. uh like like Lou and you know there look these guys have their slice of here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do and say um and and there too I I think it&#x27;s much better if you pull in people who are more the boots on the ground guys you know um rather than folks who have a questionable agenda and that hasn&#x27;t happened yet I have not seen a single person except the people I will say this the Senate Armed Services and intelligence committee have met with some very excellent serious people that we have brought in and some other and some from other sources that they have privately provided information and then at least back until about a year ago. We would then take them over they would take them over after I handed them off and and would take them over to the to the Senate.</p>
<p>They would then be taken over to the uh uh AROW office at the Pentagon. But of course, that ended up being a total storefront fraud. Um that just covered up all their testimony as you know. Or if you don&#x27;t, we&#x27;ll talk about that. &gt;&gt; Well, this was the second congressional meeting.</p>
<p>The first one happened in 2023. &gt;&gt; And uh David Grush essentially led the charge &gt;&gt; in that first hearing. &gt;&gt; Um what&#x27;s your take on David Grush? Oh, well I think you know he his first of all I I met with him when he was undercover and provided information to his bosses and him on this and that&#x27;s how they were able to get to a lot of the information he found. But again he&#x27;s a secondhand witness. He was not a primary person.</p>
<p>Now he got ended up meeting primaries. Okay. So after there was enough actionable intelligence of where who you know where the locations of these uh facilities and secret bases and stuff and he did so but here&#x27;s a caveat. He ended up going over and was kind of intercepted by Lu Alzando. And then he started telling tall tales about aliens blowing up villages uh in South America or Africa and stuff, things he was not read onto.</p>
<p>And and so here&#x27;s one of the problems. The whole ufology ma that whole environment is sort of a snake pit or a sand trap where people just get pulled in. And so what he&#x27;s talked about I know for a fact he was speaking the truth about that that there were these facilities that we have reverse engineered the craft all of that 100% correct where I have a problem and this I&#x27;ve talked to my own whistleblowers about this stay in is stay with what you directly know don&#x27;t start getting stuff secondhand and then and speaking on it as if it&#x27;s something you have firsthand knowledge of. So I&#x27;m very, you know, I&#x27;m a doctor. I&#x27;m a scientist.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for 35 years. That&#x27;s where you go sideways, right? So, so your your question is a good one, but it doesn&#x27;t have a simple answer. The answer is yes. The core of what he spoke to that he investigated directly. Correct.</p>
<p>much of what was said that that was peripheral that he picked up from the culture, let&#x27;s say, of these folks who intercepted him who are slick disinformation people who are very well trained. That is where he got in trouble. And so, um, now the reason so many people hate me is that I call that out. I go, &quot;No, that was correct. That&#x27;s not correct.&quot; Um, and you know, and it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s got to do that.</p>
<p>I mean otherwise the public and the Congress who don&#x27;t know anything about the subject are going to keep getting this bad mix of good information with toxic disinformation that&#x27;s designed to take the narrative into the alien threat world. were designed to take it into some other direction that serves the military-industrial complex and this sort of global uh effort of people who want to you know you know kind of the Independence Day theme. Let&#x27;s unite the world around an alien threat this sort of idiotic narrative. &gt;&gt; Well, after the first congressional meeting, the Pentagon actually went through the report and announced that there was no evidence of any alien technology in the report. Total nonsense.</p>
<p>Um, and the you&#x27;re talking about the Pentagon report. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, Dr. Kurpatre, who is the head of Arrow, is uh has committed multiple felonies, and I&#x27;m making a statement here. It&#x27;s a strong statement.</p>
<p>Uh, and I can tell you there are firsthand people corroborating this. So, we have and you&#x27;ll see it in in our archive, the Disclosure Project Intelligence Archive, free to anyone who wants to get in there, DPICHive.com. Um, 35 years of evidence and information in there. Nobody reads it because nobody reads. It&#x27;s politically incorrect to read.</p>
<p>But if you still read, it&#x27;s all in there. Now, what you&#x27;ll find is there was a letter from the chair and co-chair of Senate Intelligence Committee castigating Arrow and Dr. Kurpatre because they knew he was sanitizing his reports of the actual evidence and testimony of people like Michael Herrera. They later issued a public report without naming Herrera and totally falsified what he said that was. They said he saw an extraterrestrial vehicle when he clearly said it was man-made staffed with people that look like special projects, humans, some kind of special operations group, uh, but private.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t have any military insignia. So, this has happened. I And here&#x27;s the problem. He didn&#x27;t know this. A lot of the people who were brought through and referred over from Senate Intel and Armed Services were guys I brought there, but he didn&#x27;t know that.</p>
<p>And we were watching. And so the things they shared in the skiff, you know, couldn&#x27;t come out, right? But I knew because I was their original debriefer. And so bang, this got reported back to the chairs of the committee and they wrote this letter, you know, admonishing, but that continued and continued and continued. uh so much so there&#x27;s a man who received multi-million dollar contract I&#x27;ve met with recently and he had set up uh sensors and uh tracking daytime radar signals intelligence photographic of these UAPs and he had about one and a half terabytes of data gave it over to Arrow and to Dr. Kpatrick and it vanished.</p>
<p>The new director can&#x27;t even find it. It was never provided over to the oversight committees. This is something we&#x27;re in the process of fixing. So, you cannot be set up and receive millions of dollars in taxpayers funding with the mandate to honestly investigate something and then end up being a coverup artist, which is what Dr. Kurp did.</p>
<p>This is why mo most of the whistleblowers I know wouldn&#x27;t touch that office with a 10-ft pole because the people over the last three years that we brought through there saw how their evidence and testimony was either covered up or distorted deliberately distorted factually distorted and and that is a felony because you&#x27;re reporting falsely back to the Congress and there&#x27;s a law mandating here&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing. So, and this is why, you know, I tell talk to some of the people in law enforcement federally, I go, &quot;Hello, anyone want to enforce the law, right? Because if I were to pull a stunt like that, I&#x27;d be in I&#x27;d be in shackles, right? So, why why are these bad actors immune uh from lying to Congress, falsifying reports, whatever it is?&quot; So, uh that&#x27;s a big problem. So whatever you know they what how do you know they&#x27;re lying? I learned this in 1993 after I briefed the director of the CIA their lips are moving in Washington these people. How do you know they&#x27;re lying? Their lips are moving. So on this subject you know I&#x27;m sorry I sound so cynical but you know I&#x27;m too old and too tired to pretend that it&#x27;s just not a bunch of chicainery.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well Netflix had a series called Investigation Alien. It was saw it, never heard of it. &gt;&gt; It was hosted by journalist George Knap. And one of the the big things in terms of the focus on the series was this jellyfish UFO video from Iraq. &gt;&gt; You know what I&#x27;m talking about? &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>[clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now, I looked at this video. I did some searches online. What a lot of people are saying is it&#x27;s actually just a bunch of balloons &gt;&gt; that are just &gt;&gt; flying through there based on a wind. And you know, as someone who has &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; you know, helium balloons in my house, sometimes you see how they just sort &gt;&gt; of them.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. At one point they get a little bit low, then they just sort of float around the room at eye level. And that&#x27;s what it kind of looked like to me. Now, did you think that this was an actual jellyfish alien or &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t either.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But but again, I don&#x27;t have I&#x27;m not involved with that. I have no provenance of its origin. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve really looked into. Um, I try to avoid the things that are in the pop culture. I hate to say it.</p>
<p>So, you probably know a lot more about all that than I ever will. And I&#x27;m too busy to sit and look at Pablum that comes out on &gt;&gt; whatever. So, I I&#x27;m just being honest. I really don&#x27;t A lot of what you might ask about I have no knowledge of. I don&#x27;t have time for it.</p>
<p>Um, and it&#x27;s usually such nonsense that I just, you know, 30 seconds in I turn it off. But, so I I just don&#x27;t know. I mean, you know, but I I don&#x27;t have any I don&#x27;t have anyone in the intelligence and military or aerospace contracting world that&#x27;s brought that up to me as something of interest. So, that&#x27;s all I can say. &gt;&gt; What about the whole New Jersey drone? &gt;&gt; Oh, the drones is another story.</p>
<p>Those were false flag operations designed to get people all riled up like the War of the Worlds in New Jersey in the 30s. What is it? Or some wells or somebody um where you know but the White House did make a mistake in saying that all of those were test objects that were known by FAA. I mean I was on a news program with a lieutenant general who said that&#x27;s absolutely not the case. And uh the people I know who under contract uh for one of the aerospace companies went out there to investigate them concluded what I did and that it was some type of testing of media and and public reaction as sort of a false flag to see what people would say and do and see what kind of rumors could be spun off from it. So often times they&#x27;ll do sort of a trial balloon of this false alien invasion stuff, but 100% of that was even the things that look like orbs and stuff, those were hours.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s all ours. And &gt;&gt; it was a false flag operation. What I understand that was is that when you had, let&#x27;s unpack this a little further. um between uh about a year ago and November, the plan was for uh a highle group of whistleblowers uh that included Jake and some of his folks were not going to come out publicly. They were simply going to take all the hard evidence they had, hand it over, we were going to put it out on a blockchain system, and it would come out, right? And it was explained that that would be too catastrophic because it would be so explosive.</p>
<p>And so they decide to do this slower controlled process and wait and but also to unmask themselves right where they would come forward publicly which changes opsex completely operational security completely because now you&#x27;re identified you are identified right as an individual and you therefore are at risk. Um, so it changed the whole plans. But when it was going to be and when these drones even all the way until shortly before the inauguration, we thought there was going to be a dump a big release of enormous amount of dispositive proof and evidence and that didn&#x27;t happen. And uh so but when that was still in the planning and discussion, they launched anticipatory to that all these drones and orbs and what have you because they wanted people to start thinking that everything uh that they were going to disclose was somehow related um to to just drones and and and experimental uh things. So, it was a uh SCOP basically that was done in anticipation of events that were planned that ended up not coming to fruition because it was decided these guys would come out publicly rather than stay clandestine and masked and and and but just let the evidence out.</p>
<p>So I think the thinking in that group was that this needs to be a more controlled release with executive orders and congressional actions providing a pathway. Uh, and there are some very senior people, you know, there&#x27;s a chairman of a major corporation, a household name in America who&#x27;s reached out to me who has documents, all this evidence. And soon as he reached out to me, he had his family threatened, his grandchildren and children. And uh right now if he were to come forward his his concern aside from perhaps having all this wealth confiscated under RICO racketeering influence corrupt organization act which like what you use against a mafia because this organization running this is like the world&#x27;s largest mafia organized crime network. So so he can&#x27;t come out because the Congress never got amnesty through.</p>
<p>was killed about a year ago in December of 2023. And so far there, you know, I mean, look, the president&#x27;s only been there a month, but there&#x27;s not been any executive orders that explicitly would give a a pathway both for personal protection like marshals or legal protection, which would be like immunization or amnesty or safe harbor. So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really what needs to happen for for us to get the most important material out and also to get uh these people secured. But I think there&#x27;s something that we can do besides that and if you want to hear about it spooky but interesting. &gt;&gt; Well, Elon Musk, Trump&#x27;s new best friend.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know him. [laughter] He&#x27;s consistently said that he&#x27;s never seen any signs of aliens or UFOs. And this is someone who regularly launches ships into space. &gt;&gt; Well, he it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s on board those ships. And I look, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not as if every airline pilot has seen these.</p>
<p>But there are many who have. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s one sitting in our room right here. All right. Captain of a major airline. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on, hold on. &gt;&gt; So, this person sitting next to us &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; has seen what? &gt;&gt; These UFOs while he&#x27;s been flying his uh jets for a major airline. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you will Are you willing to jump in at some point and talk about it? &gt;&gt; Could we? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s totally up to him.</p>
<p>But &gt;&gt; Okay. Are you Hold on. Are you willing to talk about it? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, we&#x27;ll bring you in a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t hang just every idiot. You mean [laughter] &gt;&gt; just me? &gt;&gt; The people who just sort of hang in my orbit are going to be folks like that, you know. That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Got it. Okay. So, we&#x27;ll get to that. So, go on. &gt;&gt; Uh where was I? &gt;&gt; Elon Musk.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, it doesn&#x27;t mean that, you know, he would have been read read onto this or read into it. Now, whether he really has no knowledge of this or uh or he has information and has been told not to go there, I don&#x27;t know. I I think what I would recommend to Mr. Musk is you should not comment on things you don&#x27;t know anything about.</p>
<p>And if you do know about it, never lie to the public. It&#x27;s best to say, &quot;I really don&#x27;t know,&quot; or deflect. So my advice, if Mr. Musk is listening, I doubt he is, but is that never make a false statement. Um, and if you express an opinion, have it be an informed opinion.</p>
<p>So I think that is what is important to do. Uh because otherwise people are going to be suspicious when all this comes out. Those comments by all kinds of officials are going to come back to haunt them. It&#x27;s like well did you not know in which case what kind of researcher are you or you did know and you were lying to the public. Neither are very good outcomes.</p>
<p>So, what I&#x27;m recommending to people who are in official positions or public positions is either say nothing or speak the truth, &gt;&gt; but don&#x27;t say something that is based on you&#x27;re not knowing something. Uh, now I wouldn&#x27;t mind if someone does a qualifier and says, &quot;I&#x27;ve really looked I haven&#x27;t looked into this, but to my knowledge, I don&#x27;t know anything about it or what because that&#x27;s that&#x27;s fair game, right?&quot; Um, and that&#x27;s an appropriate response. I answer questions like that all the time. Like you just ask me about this jellyfish. Well, it&#x27;s not my expertise.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t heard anything about it. And you know, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with saying I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And as an emergency and trauma guy, the worst doctors think they know everything and they&#x27;re the ones going to kill you.</p>
<p>So I tell people and the worst pilots are the ones that they think they know everything. They don&#x27;t listen to the co-pilot and they crash right to the side of a mountain. So, I think that a little bit of introspection and humility is needed. If you&#x27;re in a powerful position where you don&#x27;t go off talking about things you really aren&#x27;t knowledgeable about, it&#x27;s best just to say nothing. &gt;&gt; Well, Tom Dong, who is the co-founder of Blink 182 and who&#x27;s worked with you &gt;&gt; oh way back when he was a kid.</p>
<p>Yeah, we had &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh to the Stars Academy. That was the one thing you guys worked on together. &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no. That was Lou Alzando intercepted him, gas lit him, used him, and spit him out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; Go look at that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Got it. So, you weren&#x27;t involved in that at all? &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>No. This I Tom Dong and I predate that going back to the early 2000s, I think, after the Disclosure Project press conference in 2001. And then, uh, yeah, I got to know those guys and it was they were fun. We had a good time. But yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you still keep in contact with Tom? I haven&#x27;t in a while because once he got pulled into the disinformation nexus, right? Um then he got convinced that evil alien there were these good and bad evil aliens in a war and then he got convinced and then he got pulled in by Louis Alzando into doing the to the stars academy and and then he got run over by those guys. So I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a sad story. I I really try to stick with people who can kind of stay on path on track, you know, and uh but no, I I never I mean Tom Delong was a a great guy. We had good times together and you know interesting person.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now David Gush. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Do you guys still keep in contact? No, I haven&#x27;t been because I try to keep myself free of folks who don&#x27;t stay on the straight and narrow when it comes to what they know. Uh because as soon as that we were doing our national press club event in 2023 in June and it broken all the news that he was talking about the aliens blowing up villages and killing innocent people. Interestingly, the year before or two years before we had uncovered that in the Dr.</p>
<p>Jacqu Valet in one of his books in 1992 put an entry in that he had received a CIA document from 1985 chronicling or documenting the fact that the CIA was uh running abductions on quote peasants in Brazil and Argentina for its psychological warfare value. I am quoting now. And we&#x27;re trying to get that original document, but I think the people couple people I know who have it have been told, &quot;Don&#x27;t provide that. You&#x27;re a dead man.&quot; So, but that is a fact. That&#x27;s 40 years ago that there&#x27;s a document that proves that the SCOPs uh psychological warfare operations out of the agency were conducting abductions for exactly for the reasons we&#x27;ve warned about.</p>
<p>So, so I tell people that is a fact and it&#x27;s a fact that needs to be proven as this whole subject gets disclosed. Otherwise, it&#x27;s going to be the UFOs are real, ETSs are real, and they&#x27;re here to eat us for lunch. Now, we have to go to war, right? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s Pavlovian. I mean, it&#x27;s almost like a automaticity like that little sixth grade first grader, six-year-old going, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you afraid of being abducted?&quot; I&#x27;m going, uh, no, not unless there&#x27;s a covert human team. &gt;&gt; Well, you&#x27;ve said there&#x27;s 69 different types of extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, that we knew of in 1960s. There may be many more now. &gt;&gt; Okay. And are these aliens from different planets or &gt;&gt; Yes, I&#x27;m quite sure they would be from different star systems. Um, because of the diversity of the biological form and size.</p>
<p>I mean, some are foot and a half tall. some report to be 10 12 feet tall. um you know the to my knowledge they&#x27;re all uh bipeedal two arms two legs head sort of that form but then a huge amount of variation within that form and this would explain why some of those craft are very very tiny and some very large I mean if you&#x27;re a twoft 3ft tall being you know a 25 30 foot diameter egg-shaped craft is kind of spacious right you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like us being in something 60 ft proportion What are the size differences? I mean, are there like insectsized aliens and &gt;&gt; giant, you know, &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know, like whalesized aliens? I mean, what&#x27;s the what&#x27;s the range? Cuz it could technically be anything, right? I mean, because like in our case, &gt;&gt; you talked about this some of your interviews, humans evolve from monkeys, &gt;&gt; right? And monkeys are warlike. &gt;&gt; They kill each other. They they fight.</p>
<p>They troops [clears throat] &gt;&gt; and so forth. But if you had a species that evolved from, let&#x27;s say, dolphins or something like that that aren&#x27;t warlike, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This might be an alien species that don&#x27;t kill each other and they don&#x27;t understand why humans are killing each other all the time. &gt;&gt; They don&#x27;t. I understand it. They just think that it&#x27;s a shame we haven&#x27;t evolved past it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. So, in terms of the alien species that you&#x27;re familiar with, what&#x27;s the range? Are they all like little gay men or are they just completely different? &gt;&gt; Oh, no. They&#x27;re totally different. And most of the ones that you see on the spooky covers of books and Whitley, those are ours. Those are our robotic fake aliens.</p>
<p>Those are the the CIA drones and robotic objects. And some the really sophisticated ones are actually bio nano machines where they have biological material uh and are that&#x27;s what they were using. um the the culture material from the cattle and animal mutilations was being used to make those very sophisticated fake aliens. Um and you know there&#x27;s a physicist that I know who worked on those programs and uh I mean it really sounds like Mingala or you know stranger things or something but &gt;&gt; um the strangest things are true my friend and so I you know in terms of my personal knowledge I have heard of ones a foot and a half or so tall to ones that range the upper end 30 to 40 feet tall. &gt;&gt; 30 to 40 feet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. But that&#x27;s, you know, pretty rare. And, you know, depending on the planet and the gravitational and everything else. I mean, look, there there are humans that have been 8t tall and there are humans that have been 3 feet tall.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I think about the cosmos and how vast. I mean, it would make sense there&#x27;d be enormous diversity. Uh, and this brings to another question. I mean, you talk about war and the only way homo sapiens, humans, evolve past where we&#x27;re stuck is, and that people say, &quot;Well, this sounds like a spiritual discussion now.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, maybe it is.&quot; Is that we have to find some foundation for our commonality, our oneness.</p>
<p>And it can&#x27;t be that we&#x27;re just human because now we have non-humans that we&#x27;re dealing with. So, what is that? I always tell people it&#x27;s at that deep level of uh the pure level of quiet consciousness or spirit that they&#x27;ve done studies is actually a singularity. You know, Erin Schroinger, the father of modern particle wave theory and and quantum physics in 1908 said uh he said that the total number of minds in the universe is one that is it&#x27;s a singularity and so that&#x27;s the foundation of the C5 contact protocols because not only is the consciousness field not limited by space or time but also the understanding and experience of that whether it&#x27;s in a meditative state or even just intellectually understanding it becomes the foundation of you looking into the eyes of a nonhuman extraterrestrial um or a person on this planet who may be a different race or a different culture or whatever and seeing beyond the superficial and seeing right into the the the soul or right into the conscious being that&#x27;s in there. Um and beyond that this sort of clear light of pure consciousness like when you go into the deep meditative state the kind of samadei or whatever you know before I was a doctor I was a meditation teacher and so I really did a deep dive into that um because I when I was 17 I had a near-death experience and you know and it really opened up that universe to me because I my family were atheists and like they if it didn&#x27;t infant test tube didn&#x27;t exist so you But that dinner or death experience when I was 17 was where I experienced for a period of time uh when I was away uh the sort of the unbounded cosmic aspect of our own consciousness. It wasn&#x27;t that I went somewhere.</p>
<p>I realized that&#x27;s what&#x27;s in within us. And so when you have that experience then you realize that&#x27;s why our motto is one universe one people. So we don&#x27;t view them as alien. I hate the word alien because it conotes foreignness and xenophobia. I usually use the word ET people or ET civilizations, non-human civilizations.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, you talked about how you&#x27;ve interacted with extraterrestrials by going into a meditative state and sometimes using very psychedelics. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Never. Now, they&#x27;ll do that to the P3 operators, all kinds of drugs and stuff. No, my group. Um, listen. I know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;re not taking any drugs at all? Never. &gt;&gt; When you&#x27;re Cuz that&#x27;s what I assumed. It was a bunch of guys getting high and just seeing a bunch of weird lights. Like, it&#x27;s not that. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>No. We never do any drugs. And in fact, it&#x27;s against protocol completely. But, &gt;&gt; um, and it&#x27;s not necessary. Uh, now, can you have a breakthrough moment with some of those substances? Yes.</p>
<p>But even the the the shaman that teach you know things like Iawaska will say that if you did it once as a gateway thing but what happens is that then people use it as a crutch. Um and they don&#x27;t just do it once to get to a breakaway a breakout moment. It becomes something that uh and this is the typical western uh use of of substances right everything you know whether it&#x27;s weed or booze or this or that. It&#x27;s an addictive uh materialistic view instead of something useful. So I am actually quite skeptical of that even though I know it&#x27;s the zeitgeist is in that direction.</p>
<p>Uh but it&#x27;s not necessary. So you know I teach people um and the C5 contact app has a whole meditation training course in it. Um and none of it involves any substances and isn&#x27;t necessary. And we have the most extraordinary experiences in consciousness but also in what we see. And and I think that that is something that people need to realize.</p>
<p>Everything you need, you naturally already have. It&#x27;s all within us. Now, if you need some augmentation or whatever fires your rockets, I&#x27;ve never done any of that stuff and haven&#x27;t needed to, but maybe I was lucky. I died when I was 17. I had a near-death experience.</p>
<p>I mean, lucky, unlucky, whatever you want to look at. Um, survived it obviously because here we are. But um it was something that taught me that that aspect of our own self that&#x27;s awake that is expanded that connects to this sort of cosmic mind great being the native people. My grandmother was Cherokee. So that is always within all of us and all things and all places.</p>
<p>So once you understand that and experience it and that&#x27;s the beauty of some of the science that&#x27;s been done around the science of consciousness by Dr. John at at Princeton be I spoke with him before he died. He had the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab where they had people putting their awareness on random number generators. No wires, not like Neurolink what Elon&#x27;s doing, but just look at them and intend the random number generator to spit out more ones than zeros and it would statistically significant. What was interesting if there are two people doing it loved each other it was an exponential increase.</p>
<p>This is why I tell people when we do these close encounters of the fifth kind, the C5 contact protocol, when you do it with a few people, not a huge crow, I do it with huge crowds, but when you do it with a few people and there&#x27;s coherence and and brotherhood, sisterhood, love in that group, it has this very powerful effect that&#x27;s almost like a magnet to these advanced civilizations because they know that the future of humanity rests on uh humans having not just technological development but social and spiritual development simultaneously uh which is of course sorely lacking and by spirituality I&#x27;m not referring to organized religion per se I&#x27;m talking about something that transcends organized religion into sort of the meaning of religion is from the religio is return to the source well the source of all intelligent life is this unbounded state of consciousness samadei whatever you want to call Have you ever had any contact with people from Heaven&#x27;s Gate? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Are you familiar with what this is? &gt;&gt; I knew it was a cult that uh did mass suicide down in San Diego right as we were doing the first congressional briefings privately in 97. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s all I know cuz I remember it was a disaster. &gt;&gt; It was based on aliens. It was based on them thinking that this alien ship was gonna come down and take them all into heaven and and so forth and then &gt;&gt; ultimately ended in a mass suicide.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; you have groups out there that take &gt;&gt; these alien concepts and kind of twist them into strange cults and so forth that some sometimes end in the worst possible way like &gt;&gt; heaven&#x27;s gate. &gt;&gt; What are your thoughts on that? Well, I think that people should not be part of a cult like that. What I tell people is that the reason I refuse to I I kind of the people who know me well know I can be a little bit brusk and profane because I do not want to be someone&#x27;s guru. &gt;&gt; People accuse you of this.</p>
<p>I mean, you have these big meetings out where people I&#x27;ve been accused of so forth. I mean, that&#x27;s could be viewed as a cult by some people. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, I mean, so you go to a a football game, you&#x27;re at a cult because you&#x27;re with fans. I mean, it&#x27;s stupid. No offense, that&#x27;s a stupid comment.</p>
<p>So, you know, you know, it&#x27;s dumb as All right. So, yes, people go out and we do this together. Sometimes we train large groups, but it&#x27;s not something where there&#x27;s some kind of a cult-like protocol. In fact, you if you ever went to one, which you should, you&#x27;ll learn that I tell everyone whatever it is we&#x27;re doing in medicine as a doctor, here&#x27;s the the ethos. See one, do one, teach one.</p>
<p>You see it done once, the next time you&#x27;re doing it yourself on your own. The third time you&#x27;re teaching a secondyear medical student, right? And so the idea is that everyone empowers themselves to master this capability both in consciousness but also as an operational team and make peaceful contact. That&#x27;s our ethos right there. Now there&#x27;s nothing cultlike about it. Now a lot of people if you use anything that&#x27;s people disregard as woowoo consciousness and meditation you are a priori a cult.</p>
<p>Well that&#x27;s ridiculous also. Um now could someone turn it into that? Yeah. And I had a I had a talk with um a wonderful man named Tony Robbins about this and he wrote a book I&#x27;m not your guru. &gt;&gt; Right. And so that&#x27;s kind of how I feel with people.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m I like teaching. I like showing people, but ultimately I don&#x27;t want you to, you know, a bunch of chaas or devotees. No, learn this and then go do it yourself and and and empower yourself. So, if anything, I&#x27;m in the anti-cult approach to this um very strongly. Um which is also why, you know, I I think that it but you&#x27;re you hit on a good point and that is slippery slope.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Very slippery slope. Very slippery. &gt;&gt; Yes. And that&#x27;s why I I make it very clear that ain&#x27;t me, you know, don&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>Now, there are people who&#x27;ve tried to spin off what I&#x27;m doing, create their own little cults, right? &gt;&gt; So, that&#x27;s different. But, um, you know, and I can&#x27;t control that because people are going to do what they&#x27;re going to do. Uh, but there&#x27;s no reason why people can&#x27;t have someone who teaches them. It doesn&#x27;t mean that and you can respect the teacher uh but it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to then become some slavish person to someone channeling you know goob bloop from the planet cahooa you know or whatever it is you know it&#x27;s like come on you know I mean use your own brain use your own consciousness and faculties and and do this yourself you know what I like the most I got a couple years ago I got a email I don&#x27;t check my own I have people who do that but it was this truck driver in Croatia and he was going on and he was had the C5 app, C5 contact app and he stopped. It was late at night to pull out.</p>
<p>There was nobody out in the mountains Croatia and he was doing the whole meditation and he kind of felt that he made contact. Suddenly a a very kind of circular uh ET crap materialized and went from left to right right over the front of in front of his cab and vanished. And he wrote this and this was just like a bloke who was like you you&#x27;d have a a beer with at a pub who&#x27;s a truck driver. And I went yes that is exactly right. And you know because what I tell people is everyone can everyone&#x27;s who&#x27;s a human is conscious and that consciousness is a singularity and so I think it doesn&#x27;t matter how your your intelligence your training whether you&#x27;re rich whether you&#x27;re poor I mean I grew up in a two- room shack with no heat no air conditioning abandoned on the streets I was very poor in the south Carolina so I tell people anyone can do this right and and I think the the the where people get into trouble is where they give their power up to a leader, a religious, whether it&#x27;s political or religious or someone else, right? So, I I&#x27;m very strict about independent investigation of the truth, critical thinking, doing things on your own, you know, and like I tell people, don&#x27;t take my word for it.</p>
<p>Try it on the evidence we have. Don&#x27;t take my word for it. Go look at the 115 whistleblowers we have in our archive with their testimony. Name, rank, and serial number. Have you seen them? When I tell people when you&#x27;re like Mr.</p>
<p>Musk, I&#x27;d say, &quot;Well, have you looked at that?&quot; These are named firsthand whistleblowers. 115 of them on a silver platter. We I&#x27;ve spent $20 million putting this together. Who&#x27;s looking at it? &gt;&gt; Wait, you spent $20 million? &gt;&gt; Oh, at least over the last 30 years doing this. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>Well, where did the money come from? &gt;&gt; Me, my work, and as a doctor. I mean, I&#x27;ve sacrificed a lot. I don&#x27;t talk about it, but And donors. We&#x27;ve &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying. Were there a lot of donors that came in with money? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Over years. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, it&#x27;s a huge expense. &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, I mean, just flying all these witnesses into Washington, putting on those press conferences, you&#x27;re talking seven digits here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, you know, and that&#x27;s why people say, &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s a tuition for what you&#x27;re doing.&quot; I say, &quot;Yeah, it needs to be 10 times that.&quot; So, shut up and say thank you. But Right. Look, I&#x27;ve given up $500 $600,000 a year for years to do this for free. Right. I don&#x27;t get paid.</p>
<p>Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So, who&#x27;s paying me? The US government? No. So, I I push back very hard on that and I say there needs to be support for this.</p>
<p>This is the other problem is that if [clears throat] you if you sell a bunch of nonsense in snake oil, you&#x27;ll get millions of dollars in contracts from the US government like Bigalow Aerospace did. 22 million flushed it down the toilet. If you&#x27;re actually doing the hard work, you get natada, &gt;&gt; right? So, it&#x27;s a very unrewarding profession. Let me just put it that way. Very I mean, but I feel like I have a purpose here to do.</p>
<p>I I mean I you we have the knowledge, who have the information, we know what the consequences are. So I guess to those who have, you know, great knowledge on something, they have great responsibility. So I take that very seriously, but it&#x27;s an ethical decision, not a financial one. &gt;&gt; Well, you mentioned that there&#x27;s underwater UFOs. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Lots. They&#x27;ve been tracked for decades. &gt;&gt; I mean, that makes a lot of sense because we&#x27;ve really explored the oceans barely at all. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.</p>
<p>Like what probably 95% of the ocean has been completely unexplored &gt;&gt; and twothirds of the earth is covered. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; So are there actual alien bases the bottle bottom of the ocean and so forth? &gt;&gt; There are both human and nonhuman assets that have been in the ocean. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like Atlantis kind of.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I I do know that out in that area there are some strange phenomenon and u what area do you mean? like what used to be called the Bermuda Bermuda TRA. Okay. I heard about this in the 80s where planes would just disappear and so forth. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re saying that&#x27;s a real thing? &gt;&gt; Yes. But that was a underwater covert human array, electromagnetic array.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a similar one down at the South Pole. We had a new whistleblower with Rathon describe a mile under the ice these nutrino light emitters and detectors that are down there at the South Pole, not Antarctica, South Pole. And uh you can look at his testimony, Eric Hecker uh who is down there for a year at that base. And so there&#x27;s a lot of uh unusual things that are placed under the ocean.</p>
<p>Uh then there have been extraterrestrial vehicles and I understand even uh bases that could be deep because they can go through any medium. You know, some people call it trans medium. In other words, you can go through uh water, solid rock, etc. and so on. So, the technology allows for passing straight through solid matter.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, cuz you said teleportation is a real thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And this is what you&#x27;re talking about. &gt;&gt; Uh, no, that&#x27;s separate. A teleportation is based on quantum entanglement.</p>
<p>Basically, what Einstein called the spooky effect where you have you could have the same particle two places simultaneously. So a teleportation would be it&#x27;s here here and it&#x27;s through a quantum entanglement resonance whereas something that would pass that would look 3D even the sun shining on it could pass straight through into a mountain because the the resonant frequency of the matter and the electronics of that craft cause it to mostly be unaligned with the matrix let&#x27;s call it of matter in this dimension. So, and it gets a little esoteric, but if you can visualize my body, I&#x27;m, you know, 6&#x27;4 and weigh 220. If you were to take out all the space between the atoms and molecules, all the mass of my body would fit on the tip of a needle of a pen. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. So, but it&#x27;s this size. So, what if you took this a little bit out of angular momentum frequency? Then this body could walk right through that wall and my atoms would not touch those atoms &gt;&gt; because you&#x27;re going between the atoms. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because you&#x27;re passing in the space between.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. I mean, it gets into some esoteric physics. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That&#x27;s pretty wild.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, you mentioned the coverup is really focused on world energy and how trillions and trillions of dollars are made with oil, gas, you know, fossil fuels, and so forth. And you&#x27;re basically saying that the US and possibly other governments have unlimited clean energy. &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Using alien technology. &gt;&gt; Well, not the US government that&#x27;s constitutional, but the secret government does. There are two governments, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; At least two, &gt;&gt; right? So, what they&#x27;re saying, well, what you&#x27;re saying is that if this was actually uncovered, all these industries would collapse in one day. &gt;&gt; Well, it would benefit the earth. No, the No, the here&#x27;s the thing &gt;&gt; and and I was on a show uh Patrick David has a show.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know Patrick interviewed him and um &gt;&gt; and and this came up in that interview. I said, &quot;Look, if if someone came in right now and put on that table one of these zero point or free energy devices to get it from that phase to where it&#x27;s being manufactured, mass manufacturing to replace the one and a half billion motor vehicle engines in the world and to provide all the energy for 2 and a half billion homes on the planet, plus all the mill hundreds of millions of businesses, factories, that&#x27;s going to be 15, 20 years if you did it like the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. So, it&#x27;s not as if there w isn&#x27;t going to be a transition because just logistically it&#x27;s not possible to make it happen all at once. But it would eventually cause the elimination of the need for all fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric dams, all of it would be obsolete. Now, my argument is that should have happened 100 years ago.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why we did the documentary The Lost Century, right? Now, the most recent documentary we released is called Battle for Disclosure. And if you look at Battle for Disclosure, uh that deals with some of this as well because the the big question is going to be do we do a real honest disclosure or sort of a fake one, light one, because an honest one is going to include the man-made. I mentioned this earlier. That&#x27;s a bigger secret than the non-human, right? Well, are you talking about a 0 point quantum vacuum spacetime? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about right now. &gt;&gt; Sure.</p>
<p>And we can put you you know I&#x27;m meeting with someone to what is today? Yeah, tomorrow who&#x27;s a inventor and has 20 patents and has come across this and doesn&#x27;t know what to do with it. So, um that has [clears throat] to be open sourced you. It has to be put out without patents and released massively. uh because over the last hundred years anyone who&#x27;s tried to use a conventional business model or the patent office have had it seized. You know, we can prove this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And meanwhile, you know, the earth is being greatly damaged by how look there are 8 billion people living on the planet like we did in the 1800s in in the industrial revolution. You know, oil, gas, coal, roads, internal combustion engines, that was Mercedes 1888. Even rockets 1940s Verer von Brown. So, you know, and nuclear 1945. So, I always ask people, do you really think there&#x27;s been no developments in energy generation in 80 years? This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s been ruthlessly suppressed. &gt;&gt; I had a conversation with someone about this recently where if you really think about it &gt;&gt; Mhm. When you get into a plane and you fly across country, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing as doing it in the 70s. &gt;&gt; 50 years later, it the planes go about as fast.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re about as big, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s really no major difference in flying now. I mean, maybe the planes are a little nicer and the seats are a little cushier, but that&#x27;s about it. &gt;&gt; The same as a 707 in the early 60s. Yeah.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re talking 60 years later. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. So there&#x27;s really been almost no technological developments in air travel &gt;&gt; or not commercial air travel &gt;&gt; or or energy generation in more fundamental. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean we&#x27;re still using nuclear, we&#x27;re still using coal, we&#x27;re still using gas. &gt;&gt; Uh you know uh solar power is not quite there yet. &gt;&gt; No. And it&#x27;s never going to get there. Not the way it&#x27;s configured.</p>
<p>Now there have been people who&#x27;ve done what are called solar collectors that isn&#x27;t just the normal photons but all the uh energy that comes from the sun that rectifies it into very powerful like something this big that would run your house those have all been confiscated. I I&#x27;ve spoken to a couple of inventors and if people doubt it go look at the tw 2010 uh report by the Federation of American Scientists. It&#x27;s in our It may be in the briefing document here um that I&#x27;m going to give you. Uh it&#x27;s the president. It&#x27;s in the Congress&#x27;s briefing document redacted of certain things, but you&#x27;ll have a copy and people can order it now and go to drstephvener.com and order this.</p>
<p>Um it&#x27;s we just it just came out this week. So um that technology should have been out decades ago and it would enabled us to have a civilization by now with no pollution and no poverty. But of course whether it was 100 years ago in the time of Tesla the real Tesla not the Tesla car company or now it&#x27;s the same powerful industrial global interests that don&#x27;t want it out right to the detriment of 99.999% of humanity. So, at a certain point, I think that we&#x27;re going to have to say, well, we have to start that process somehow. And this this document that this research by the Federation of American Scientists found that in 1970, there was a solar panel as efficient or more than anything we have today.</p>
<p>And it had a national security seizure order on it because it would have the price point of that would have compet competed with coal and and gas back then, 50 years ago, 50 some years ago. So this nonsense, the abuse, here it is, the abuse of the National Security Authority under patent and invention laws and that continues even if you don&#x27;t patent your technology, they&#x27;ll storm troopers will come into your lab and take it, right? You don&#x27;t even have to apply for a patent once they find out you have something like that. So this thuggery, which is what it is, um makes a mockery out of democracy, but also out of a free market. You know, everybody, oh, we have a free market economy. I said, like the hell we do.</p>
<p>I mean, how do you have a free market economy if the most important inventions of the last hundred years have been ruthlessly suppressed to the benefit of a handful of global oligarchs? Nonsense. Ridiculous. It&#x27;s a myth. Well, you said that the alien crisis that no one is talking about is humans reverse engineering ET technology to use against other ETs. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re developing alien weapons to kill other aliens, &gt;&gt; right? So, this is a real problem because I mentioned earlier the technology curve isn&#x27;t flat, you know, it&#x27;s actually exponential. And so you have people who have reverse engineered extraterrestrial technologies from craft that we&#x27;ve acquired. &gt;&gt; Okay. Are you talking about scalar waves? &gt;&gt; Part of it. &gt;&gt; Part of it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And but and more. And then those then get turned into weapon systems that are used against non-human craft and ETSs to down more of them to study more of them. &gt;&gt; Ah okay. So it&#x27;s not that we just want to kill ETS but we want more technology. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a money and technology graph pure and simple. &gt;&gt; What are scalar waves? &gt;&gt; So scalar Tesla I think was an early sort of person who described and experimented with them I think in the 20s30s perhaps I have to look it up but a scalar u so the light we see in this room just make it really simple is a wave right? So it&#x27;s vac the the vacuum as it were, you have this wavelength of light passing through at 186,000 m per second. So every second it goes 186,000 miles. A lightyear is 186,000 miles every second for a whole year. That is one light year.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s okay. Now imagine what if you had what they call a scalar. It&#x27;s actually a point that comes out in a straight line. So it&#x27;s not propagating in a waveform, which means it&#x27;s multiples of the speed of light, which means it goes boom like multiples of speed. So when we detonated the first atomic bomb, for example, this is gets back to why all the ETs started coming in in force in the 40s and 50s is that a tenant with the electromagnetic pulse, which everybody knows what that is.</p>
<p>You can put a EMP up above LA and take out the whole grid, right? But an electromagnetic pulse has within it a scalar signal that propagates at multiples of the speed of light and disrupts interstellar communication and travel. That&#x27;s why it sort of rips the fabric of the 3D cosmos. So that&#x27;s why once we started detonating those, it was uh one one MI6 guy I interviewed years ago. Um uh he he had been [clears throat] military intelligence in Great Britain and then he published a a a magazine called Flying Saucer Review. Don&#x27;t you love the name? And I interviewed him at his cottage in England and great guy, brilliant guy.</p>
<p>He says, well, he says, when we did that, we kind of kicked a hornets&#x27;s nest because it not only was very disruptive to these other civilizations systems because we&#x27;re thinking straight line here to another star system taking 8 years at the speed of light. No, no, no, no, no. Forget that. We&#x27;re now talking about transdimensional technologies and scalar ones that are much faster. And so they the ETSs knew, whoo, a big red flag over planet Earth.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve gone from uh machine guns and or musketss or bows and arrows to thermonuclear weapons, right? Within about 100 years. Think about it. From 1945, the atomic bomb 100 years earlier, 1845, what were we using? You know, rifle. We didn&#x27;t have a machine gun. We didn&#x27;t have tanks.</p>
<p>We didn&#x27;t have airplanes. So in a hundred years, imagine if your civilizations monitoring the earth, and they have been, and we go from that, even though it&#x27;s dysfunctional that we&#x27;re having endless wars, but we go from that to a technological breakthrough where we are not only a threat to all life on Earth, we&#x27;re now a threat to other planets because they can they can extrapolate into the future. And then add to that we started studying very advanced extraterrestrial technologies. And to give you an idea how advanced they are, I&#x27;ll just give a little quote from uh the the director of the Lockheed Skunk Works, the president of the Lockheed Skunk Works, Ben Rich, the week he died, before he died, he spoke to a friend of mine, uh James Goodall, who&#x27;s a aerospace historian, illustrator, and he said, well, he says, anything you can imagine or that you&#x27;ve seen on Star Trek, we&#x27;ve already done at the Skunk Works. It&#x27;s out in the desert, he says.</p>
<p>But not Area 51. I know where it is. I&#x27;ve been to the site where that is. And so whatever people think humans have figured out, it&#x27;s way more. But imagine that being in the hands of a group of sociopaths, right? With the kind of malcontents and sociopathic behavior they have.</p>
<p>That is a serious national security threat and a world security threat. It&#x27;s a five alarm fire. That five alarm fire. No one&#x27;s looking at it because if you don&#x27;t know about it, you&#x27;re not looking at the problem, right? And that&#x27;s true whether it&#x27;s the president or the prime minister of the UK or the Congress or whoever it is. So when I realized this, that&#x27;s this is part of what led me to leave my medical career and work on this is that this is a great problem.</p>
<p>If you it&#x27;s got to get fixed. Uh, and ultimately I think the most dangerous part of this is that I&#x27;ve heard from three different sources don&#x27;t know each other who&#x27;ve been in communication centers that ETSs can only allow us to go so far using that kind of technology against nonhumans because then we become an existential threat to other places, right? And but it so if we humans don&#x27;t fix this and stand down those uh quite frankly illegal covert operations they&#x27;ll have to but then it will look like independent stay right so we do not want to have that as the option we want to fix this humans need to fix this ourselves uh but it&#x27;s going to take a lot of courage there are three things so far been lacking is in the 35 years I&#x27;ve been doing this from our leaders not from these special forces guys I work with. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re amazing. But and it&#x27;s three things. I call it EC.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like going to Paris here. ICI. It&#x27;s the intelligence to understand this and really drill down on it. It&#x27;s the courage to take it on because you&#x27;re going to have everything thrown at you and the integrity not to get bought off or bribed or blackmailed. Uh and those are hard thing.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the trifecta of what&#x27;s needed to do this and that&#x27;s going to be the test for Congress and the president, whoever it is, right? Because I know what&#x27;s going to be thrown at them and and uh so that that&#x27;s where it gets into a certain level. They need to be aware of the issue and then they need to authorize the team that I&#x27;m working with that I can&#x27;t say much about that or have been uh they need authorization to get these under control and they are all former special forces guys who&#x27;ve separated from the military who are ready to go today right now but they&#x27;re going to have to have the support both both the funding and the legal support to do it. Um, so my job has been to advise them and give them all the intelligence I have. And if you go and you look at this this um briefing document, this is the Oh, you got a hard copy. I didn&#x27;t know we got one.</p>
<p>First hard copy. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, this is the new briefing document for um the White House and and members of Congress. Um, it&#x27;s redacted with individual names and things that are sensitive, but I&#x27;ve never done this, but we made it available to the public uh this week and you can order it um at I think it&#x27;s drsteeenphengrrewer.com or seriousdisclosure.com. You can put the link up and it has all that in there.</p>
<p>It has a whole list of the 155 black sites. It has the Here&#x27;s a map of them. &gt;&gt; Those are the black sites. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. You want to know where they are and what&#x27;s there? It&#x27;s in here. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Any close to here? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been at a lot of them.</p>
<p>Not all of them. I But I have witnesses have whistleblowers who&#x27;ve been operational uh information. People who are tactically there, you know. Um imagine debriefing hundreds of people like Jake Barber. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;ll sign this to you. &gt;&gt; Please do. &gt;&gt; Should we? &gt;&gt; Yeah, let&#x27;s do it. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And now this other one. You want someone hand that to me or no? Could you grab a J? &gt;&gt; There you go.</p>
<p>And then this one. This is will come out in a hard co copy in a few weeks. So, this is really cool. So, I collaborated with uh the crash retrieval expert Michael Schat on this. And this is a whole collection of both the historic but also the newer crash retrievals all illustrated in each case.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see the object and you&#x27;ll see let me find one that the camera Oh, here&#x27;s Herreras. So here&#x27;s for example the uh craft that crashed uh I mean was abducting and and transporting people. This is the Indonesia 2009 event. &gt;&gt; A very good representation. And the crate there had people in it.</p>
<p>And then this is a summary on the on the other side of the page of 30 pages of testimony into a couple paragraphs, right? And on the following page is another illustration and then my commentary. So that&#x27;s what this has just come out and you can get this and it it it covers the most important cases in history. Every single one of them though, we took out anything that didn&#x27;t have a named whistleblower witness who was there or involved, whether it was police, military, corporate. Right. So, this is just available, too.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll sign it for you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Well, you claimed that JFK was killed because he had fired Alan Dulles, who was going to release info on UFO secrets. And I guess you claimed that Bobby Kennedy, there was a similar situation going on as well. &gt;&gt; No, he he wasn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>You kind of got it backwards. Jack Kennedy was killed because he wanted to get the CIA under control and him back in control of these covert UFO related programs. and associated programs, energy, propulsion, all of it. And Alan Dulles, who helped start the CIA with the billionaire Paul Milan, whose grandson I&#x27;ve been working with, uh he uh very interestingly said what he said was uh they were going to put through a federal review process and I know RFK Jr. said this on some years ago on I think Larry King and that President Kennedy was going to basically dissolve or totally reform the CIA.</p>
<p>And in the process of that, Jack Kennedy fired Alan Dulles who had been instrumental in forming the CIA after the Roswell crash in 1947. And because of that, they said, &quot;Oh, no, you&#x27;re not.&quot; and they set up an assassination with mult paths and all that. So we know that that&#x27;s the case and I have people in Europe as well as in US that have information on all of that. Uh I think also Bobby Kennedy senior RFK Jr.&#x27;s dad &gt;&gt; um and I have a I have a letter. It&#x27;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in our archive and it was dated May 1968, a month before they killed Bobby Kennedy. And it&#x27;s Bobby Kennedy saying, I&#x27;m kind of paraphrasing here, but he says, &quot;I&#x27;m a card carrying member of the Amalgamated Flying Saucer Association of America. They were called Flying Saucers back then.&quot; And it&#x27;s signed by Bobby Kennedy and how important this was. and I he wanted to get to the bottom of it if he had become president and a month later he was dead. Right? So this issue is the third rail.</p>
<p>I mean a lot of people this is one of the problems is that when people realize what the gravity of the situation is that this comes out it&#x27;s going to change almost every aspect of life on earth honestly. And there are people who don&#x27;t want that to happen. There are religious people who don&#x27;t. We can talk about that. There are technological people who don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s financial oil and other uh interests that don&#x27;t. And so, uh, anyone who wants to move in that direction ends up getting runs into this buzzsaw, right? And it makes sense. And, uh, I tell this very funny story back in 1993, September 93, and I was with Lawrence Rockefeller at the Rockefeller ranch out in the Tetons. And a lot of people don&#x27;t know the Teton, Grand Tetons were owned by the Rockefellers. They owned everything.</p>
<p>And they gave it to the US government as a national park, but they kept out this really cool ranch in this remote area called the JY Ranch. And so I was invited to come out there and and late at night, I was out on one of the decks by uh there was a bronze statue of a Native American on horse. I think it was a Remington original. And Lawrence Rockefeller turns to me. He says, &quot;You know, Dr.</p>
<p>Greer, no aspect of life on Earth will be unchanged by this being disclosed.&quot; I said, &#x27;I know, Lawrence. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so secret, &gt;&gt; and they&#x27;ve taken such extraordinary means, including killing a former president. &gt;&gt; But and and he did help. I mean, he hosted the Clintons there. Um he was a conduit for information.</p>
<p>Um he was not involved in setting up the briefing I did for the CI director for for President Clinton. In fact, he was shocked that that was being set up when I was at the ranch. And he was like, &quot;Oh my god, really?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He says, &quot;Why are you shooting?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m going to Wright Patterson Air Force Base where some of the original Roswell bodies and stuff were taken. When I leave your ranch, I&#x27;m going straight there to meet with the director of that part of that compartmented operation.&quot; Well, you said in spring of 2023 uh before the election, a team of people worked out uh reached out to you &gt;&gt; uh who worked at black sites dealing with UAPs. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And they were going to come forward with a bunch of evidence &gt;&gt; talking about earlier. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But only a few seconds ended up being released. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What was released exactly? &gt;&gt; Well, you saw the Jake Barber um the egg. &gt;&gt; Aha. So that was part of that same thing. Jake Barber was part of that, right? &gt;&gt; Part of that. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Aha. Okay. And &gt;&gt; but there&#x27;s a great deal more. What I&#x27;m what I said earlier, if you remember my comment on that, was that the plan was those folks were not going to be known publicly and that it would just be an enormous amount of of uh evidence and and materials and video and stuff of these sort of operations that would get released. and we were going to we actually built a blockchain system to do it.</p>
<p>We still have it. &gt;&gt; Um but then it was decided that that would be too catastrophic and that there weren&#x27;t preparations adequate in either Congress or the White House to deal with it and that to kind of delay that. Okay. So that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s what I was referring to earlier. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. Well, you &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not just him. There&#x27;s a whole group of folks. Yeah. bit.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, you had mentioned Michael Herrera before uh in this talk and you know there was a six-man unit that saw a hovering uh octagon UFO being loaded with weapons by unmarked US forces who threatened him at gunpoint in Indonesia. And you said he&#x27;s the only guy I ever heard who actually talked about this and wasn&#x27;t killed. &gt;&gt; Correct. I&#x27;ve never heard of someone witnessing an operation like that who wasn&#x27;t subsequently killed. &gt;&gt; So, everyone else who touched on this were taken out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Not on that platoon. I think that he feels like the only reason they didn&#x27;t flat out kill him is that there were a whole lot of his other expeditionary force around. They would have heard it, known they were missing, and would have caught that operation red-handed. So I think they did a risk benefit analysis decided let&#x27;s let these boys live right but then they when they went back on on the ship that their their marine ship hooked [snorts] up later I forget what port it&#x27;s in its testimony and you know like some guys came on and threatened them took their phones took everything and and basic and made them sign non-disclosure agreements. So his other five the other five men who were with him are terrified to come forward.</p>
<p>Herrera is a very courageous guy honestly. Um but he didn&#x27;t know what was in that crate until Jake Barber was at the conference that I did in 2023 at the National Press Club and the the weekend before at the Marriott. and he saw that illustration we had done and he immediately texted me and we went to the green room where I was being held and he said, &quot;Those aren&#x27;t drugs. Those are people in there.&quot; I went, &quot;What?&quot; So, see, Michael Herrera didn&#x27;t know. He just assumed it was drugs and guns being run by a clandestine operation because they make a lot of money that way and drug trade, very lucrative cash.</p>
<p>No, these were uh people who were going to be used in P3 psionic training and experimentationists. So, which was even worse. So, oh my god, what&#x27;s worse than transporting drugs through a clandestine covert illegal operation is people, right? &gt;&gt; And P3 stands for &gt;&gt; uh psionic potential. Sorry, I&#x27;m blocking on the third, but it&#x27;s basically telepathic. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Capability. You know, a lot of what you do has the word disclosure in it. Mhm. &gt;&gt; And uh Stephen Spielberg uh his latest film actually changed the title to disclosure. &gt;&gt; I know.</p>
<p>I should have copyrighted that. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Right. And I mean Spielberg has a history of doing things with aliens, &gt;&gt; you know, in terms of topics in his movies. The most famous of which &gt;&gt; uh well, there&#x27;s a few. There is Close Encounters of the Third Kind.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s the best one. &gt;&gt; Uh there&#x27;s also ET. &gt;&gt; ET. That was sweet. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>But uh Close Encounters of the Third Kind uh there was a guy named Jacques Vali. Valet Valet. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the one who has that CIA document. &gt;&gt; Abductions. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And he was actually consultant on that film. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know Jacques? &gt;&gt; Uh yes. I don&#x27;t know him well. I know of him and met him.</p>
<p>But and also JLen Heinik who had been head of Project Blue Book was a consultant on the film. &gt;&gt; Okay. makes a cameo appearance actually towards the end there as a bearded white-haired scientist. Yeah. And he was the head of Project Blue Book for the Air Force that studied UFOs.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, when you see that film, Close Encounters, is there anything in there that&#x27;s actually based on what you found or is it all fiction? &gt;&gt; No. Well, oh, obviously it&#x27;s Hollywood, but actually most of what&#x27;s portrayed, it&#x27;s like a docu drama. uh most of what what was in there was portrayed based on actual events that had happened. &gt;&gt; Um so I the way it was explained to me uh I know it when it was shown at the Reagan White House uh President Reagan stood up and said there are only a couple people in this room who know how true to life that film is. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Wow. I know two no I know three people I think two of them are dead now who were in the screening at the White House when they showed that. So you know it&#x27;s a docu drama. Great and classic movie. Now this new one I have no idea what it&#x27;ll be.</p>
<p>Um I I don&#x27;t know Mr. Spielberg. I&#x27; I&#x27;ve met his son Max but I I don&#x27;t know him. &gt;&gt; Well Jacqu Valet was actually there was a character based on him in that film. Not only was he a consultant but they actually had a character.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Correct. I was portraying to be him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, and you know, of course, ET with the the way ET looks, I mean, I don&#x27;t know about the neck that goes up, but in general, these are very alien looking &gt;&gt; kind of &gt;&gt; beings that you you know, you&#x27;ve seen in Hollywood and you&#x27;ve seen and so forth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Um, was that based on anything or was that just all fiction as well? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I think some of them probably resemble somewhat like that, but it&#x27;s Hollywood. But I mean, you&#x27;re going to take, you know, artistic license and do things that look a way that would grab people visually, but um, you know, I I I&#x27;m sure from what I understand, there are some ETs that would be similar to those. Um, uh, there are some that have a very triangular head, for example. We have one that came to one of our C5 events that we have a photograph of that was I was here and a young medical student was here and the ET was there and &gt;&gt; you sat next to an ET.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. You haven&#x27;t seen the picture of it. &gt;&gt; I can I&#x27;ll text it to you. &gt;&gt; So you were right there with an a living ET. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And there was an elderly man who had had his hearing loss since he was an a teenager. And that night he had contact with this being and it healed him of his healing loss. &gt;&gt; No one&#x27;s on drugs either. This is a cool picture. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Is it in one of these books that you gave me? &gt;&gt; Um I&#x27;m not sure if it is. Um &gt;&gt; but you&#x27;re going to text me a picture. &gt;&gt; Sure. If you want. &gt;&gt; You want to do it right now? So So we we don&#x27;t forget.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I thought you had seen the movie Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind. &gt;&gt; Of the Fifth Kind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s that? need to see. This is on the record.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to see Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve seen them all. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve seen this? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It&#x27;s it it is amazing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Who made it? &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, this is yours. Ah, okay. &gt;&gt; And what is a fifth kind encounter? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s where we intend and invite them to come. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Because a close encounter of the third kind is contact, right? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just when you see a biological even and ET. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll send you one and and then another one. This is at night full darkness. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And you&#x27;ll like this, I think. And then I have another cool one where there it was so cold we went inside and there were these two ETs that sat in our chairs that have these conicle heads.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s less clear, but it&#x27;s very cool. And then there is this cool, my favorite is this one. It&#x27;s so abstract, but um I call this the sort of a light beam where it&#x27;s an advanced species that&#x27;s so advanced. &gt;&gt; You know, we talked about the different types of alien species. There&#x27;s like 69 that we potentially know of.</p>
<p>Now, what&#x27;s the difference between extraterrestrials versus light entities or interdimensional beings or plasmoids? &gt;&gt; Great question, and it it causes a lot of confusion. So on my YouTube channel, I&#x27;ve just started my own podcast, the Dr. Steven Greer to show, and every week you can get update on what&#x27;s going on. Now, in one of the YouTube uh videos on that site, excuse me, it has a whole deep dive into what I call ETS and the new cosmology. What kind of understanding of the cosmos is needed.</p>
<p>Now I think one of the biggest sources of confusion on this subject is the co-mingling and confusion between interstellar extraterrestrial biological entities and their craft, man-made lookalikes. And the third people call extradimensional or interdimensional entities. Um, and that&#x27;s where you get folks who confuse something that&#x27;s from another dimension with something from another star system. And the reason there&#x27;s a lot of confusion on it, part of it deliberate is sort of where they want to show paranormal onto UFO science. Uh, and it&#x27;s risky because when you start dealing with extradimensional, interdimensional, are you talking about angels, demons, bou grandmother who pops into this dimension like a poltergeist phenomenon? What are you talking about? So, it&#x27;s not helpful.</p>
<p>And what&#x27;s what I have seen happen and I think it&#x27;s deliberate. I think it&#x27;s an attempt to offiscate confuse people. And offiscation is a very good term. you know, they sort of mix it all together and confuse people looking into this is that they will deliberately blend into uh ufology and ET. You know, I like being specific.</p>
<p>So, I don&#x27;t like the term alien. Alien means all the above because whatever people think they don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s alien. It&#x27;s foreign, therefore it&#x27;s alien. Now, I&#x27;m very specific. Okay? And you&#x27;re going to hear a little bit of the obsessive compulsive doctor part come out here.</p>
<p>But um I speak of even extraterrestrial biological entities who are from other star systems right specific. That&#x27;s when I say a UFO or ET [snorts] and make a very clear distinction between that and the man-made craft and critters that are simulate ETSs that are used in deceptive operations. And actually the proper name for false flag at the Pentagon is a deceptive indication and warning deceptive IMW. So the other is this extradimensional or interdimensional phenomenon kind of like Stranger Things and that&#x27;s real and you can actually have physical phenomenon happen and things that you see that aren&#x27;t extraterrestrial or man-made but that are from another dimension. So, three things.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s very simple. Real ET, man-made UFOs, and fake ETs, and things from other dimensions that are weird. And one of one of the things I think is is dangerous about that is that if you don&#x27;t have enough knowledge to make a discernment of it, you put them all together and there you&#x27;re lost. Now, you&#x27;re lost forever. I think this is why Tucker Carlson um who&#x27;s a conservative talk show host now he&#x27;s been going around saying well the aliens are demons and they&#x27;re demonic and they&#x27;re because he has been targeted with that same crowd of disinformation people with this combination of UFOs non and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like the term NHI or non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>Well, non-human is what? Dolphins. Some say they&#x27;re more intelligent than humans. Wouldn&#x27;t be hard to be uh citations. Uh something from another dimension. Someone from another planet.</p>
<p>So, I think the lack of clarity on the language is actually deliberate and I think it&#x27;s done to confuse people and to confuse the phenomena plural. So you have multiple phenomena going on all being talked about as as if it&#x27;s the same thing. Not helpful at all. In fact, it&#x27;s very harmful. And I love when when I was at the Vatican years ago when Pope John Paul was was Pope, his senior theologian, great guy named Monsor Balduchi.</p>
<p>And he said, &quot;Neither angels nor demons need flying saucers.&quot; And he he was it was so simple. And he was a demonologist. He was like the top demonologist at the Vatican, you know, kind of creepy stuff. But um but he says, &quot;No, no, it is totally separate.&quot; And but I think there is a deliberate attempt in certain quarters to conflate, confuse all this different phenomena. I&#x27;m so glad you asked it because uh it&#x27;s actually one of the very first things in the briefing document on on the one pager uh for leaders in our country and elsewhere is you know these this is what&#x27;s being confused.</p>
<p>So let&#x27;s get some clarity here and get get a get our uh you know lexicon our word usage down accurately because otherwise it&#x27;s you&#x27;re you&#x27;re talking around each other. You know what are you talking about? Uh now there&#x27;s another subcategory of extradimensional or interdimensional and that&#x27;s humaninduced extradimensional. So let&#x27;s say you figured out some very sophisticated physics electronics at certain frequencies you can tap into another dimension and pull something out of that dimension into 3D. It&#x27;s not extraterrestrial. It&#x27;s not in it&#x27;s not innately coming in.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s induced. That&#x27;s what skinwalker is. That&#x27;s what the Bradshaw Ranch is. And I know how they do it. I know who&#x27;s doing it.</p>
<p>Why they&#x27;re doing it, right? But that&#x27;s not the same as extraterrestrial. So, you know, here&#x27;s one of the problems we have. You know, I said this earlier, a little knowledge is a very dangerous thing because what happens is when you don&#x27;t have enough information. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a very confusing picture. And in that confusion, you can be led to reach the wrong conclusions.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on in the US government and in the public and in the media. Are you familiar with the term cognitive dissonance? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now some people have accused people like you of cognitive dissonance in the terms of this like we understand that within this solar system &gt;&gt; there are no aliens &gt;&gt; there are no innate ones that &gt;&gt; that we know of you go to any other planet you know we&#x27;ve looked at Mars you know Pluto there&#x27;s probably no life you know Saturn etc etc etc so if there are aliens they are from very far away And even at light speeded travel, &gt;&gt; they would die on their way here. So a concept that you use yourself is that they travel interdimensionally. Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Meaning that they don&#x27;t travel the way that other physics objects in physics travel. They travel through a different means. &gt;&gt; Could someone say, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s just cognitive dissonance. You&#x27;re just creating a since science doesn&#x27;t support what you&#x27;re, you know, implying, you create a whole new type of science that can&#x27;t necessarily be proven. No, everything I&#x27;m saying it has been proven is proven.</p>
<p>And by the way, I [clears throat] always say these are TDIS. It&#x27;s transdimensional interstellar. So, you&#x27;re not going to go in a straight line. You know, it&#x27;s you can&#x27;t go to the speed of light and stay linear. You have to drop out of linear spaceime.</p>
<p>you know, it&#x27;s like an Einstein Rosen Bridge if you look that up or um you know, so you know, instead of it being a straight line, here&#x27;s, you know, you&#x27;re from here to here, look at it as as a plane, one point, two points, you know, you take it like a piece of paper and fold it. So, it&#x27;s right here. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s folding spaceime and that&#x27;s the gravitational wave effect. And you have that ability. Now just because it&#x27;s not being taught at MIT doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist because these are classified technologies.</p>
<p>But uh &gt;&gt; yeah I mean I mean this concept I mean is like a wrinkle in time Narnia right where they actually take [clears throat] time and instead of a straight line you kind of jumble the line together so you can jump &gt;&gt; but but that&#x27;s the whole point of the conscious quantum holographic universe. If you read the studies on quantum holography you every point in time this is quantum entanglement. every point in time in space is connected to each other. Now, that&#x27;s been proven scientifically on a particle level. What we&#x27;re talking about civilization is advanced enough to do it on the macro level.</p>
<p>A spacecraft full of people or whatever. And uh now the fact that it doesn&#x27;t comport with the textbooks on physics at MIT. So what I mean we&#x27;re like one half to step out of the jungle scientifically as a species. I mean &gt;&gt; couple hundred years ago we had what? Nothing. horses and buggies and yeah so I mean and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re talking about a universe it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; you know 15 billion years old or something so I I think that this gets into this whole discussion of not everything that can be known is known in in the conventional scientific world in fact I&#x27;d say almost everything we don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s just this huge vastness but certainly when you&#x27;re dealing with civilization and we can prove those are here because we have the bodies and the craft and all this stuff.</p>
<p>Well, how they get here? Well, they&#x27;re not using the space shuttle and they&#x27;re not using uh SpaceX and a rocket. They&#x27;re not. So, then what are they using? That&#x27;s the technology we&#x27;re talking about and it&#x27;s been studied and developed. Uh I think that this is a a big I always call this the big peace dividend down the road. Phase one of disclosing this will be the energy technologies that will just get rid of poverty and and and the damage we&#x27;re doing to the biosphere and the oceans.</p>
<p>Step two, once we have something resembling a peaceful civilization, what Mikaku calls a level one civilization where we&#x27;re not killing each other and destroying the biosphere. Once we become stable from that point of view and we&#x27;re no longer just killing each other over nonsense like we are now all over the world, then we can bring out the things that fly. So you&#x27;ll be able to go from here to Paris in three or four minutes and that&#x27;d be cool. Go there for lunch, come back. That&#x27;s totally doable there already with technologies that exist.</p>
<p>But you can&#x27;t let that out now because if you let that out now, it&#x27;s a missile delivery system for every terrorist in Mogadishu. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, if you go &gt;&gt; there has to be a process. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, if you can go from here to Paris in a couple minutes, that means you could travel to Mars in what, a couple hours, maybe &gt;&gt; about Oh, yeah. Well, really, when you ramp these things up, you&#x27;d be up 30 seconds.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s where the band 30 seconds to Mars. I gave a talk a long time ago about getting to Mars in 30 seconds. So, right. So, yeah. But &gt;&gt; which means that you could actually reach &gt;&gt; other planets that have Earthlike &gt;&gt; uh environments.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We haven&#x27;t been allowed &gt;&gt; in a human lifetime. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, it it the next day or couple days. The the reason we&#x27;re not allowed to do that at this point is that the extraterrestrial civilizations don&#x27;t want us out there too far until we become civilized. Now, people say, &quot;Oh, we are, so we&#x27;re not civilized.</p>
<p>Come to my ER on a Saturday night.&quot; &gt;&gt; What you&#x27;re saying is the aliens have human civilization on a short leash. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re they&#x27;re watching what we do to see if we actually make it through this transition. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, there are civilizations that have never made it through this transition. uh and make themselves extinct because of their foolishness.</p>
<p>And &gt;&gt; we might be one of them. &gt;&gt; We may be. [laughter] Well, this is this is to be determined, my friend. We&#x27;re &gt;&gt; on our way to that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we are.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it&#x27;s like when when uh Colonel Bearden said, &quot;Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong.&quot; He&#x27;s from Louisiana. Highest IQ. One of the highest IQ guys ever met. He said, &quot;Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the fools may blow it yet.&quot; Is a great interview with with uh Colonel Beard and it&#x27;s in our archive. Brilliant guy.</p>
<p>absolutely brilliant um phys physics and you know he had been a lieutenant colonel army uh knew about all the new energy free energy stuff just a genius uh but I think that is the big question so it is sort of an existential question and crisis you know the only way here&#x27;s sort of the bottom line on that the only way we can go forward and have a society here that&#x27;s is that we become peaceful and We can&#x27;t go out into space and be a bunch of wararmongering fools either. So that&#x27;s why we need a space treaty. We need a treaty that says we&#x27;re not going to put weapons out in space. We&#x27;re not going to target these ET assets. We&#x27;re going to stand those systems down.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to do a an official C5 ambassador outreach these civilizations. So instead of shooting them out of the skies and hijacking them and shooting them, we&#x27;re going to create a global rap and peaceful approach to them, which is what should have happened in the 50s. Eisenhower wanted that to happen. He got subverted. This is why no president has control over those covert programs since Eisenhower, since about 56, 57, 58.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, uh, Dr. Steven Greer, you actually brought someone with you, uh, Tony Ferrer, who is a former commercial pilot who actually worked for a major airline for 25 years, and you&#x27;ve actually had experience with UFOs. &gt;&gt; Yes, I have. &gt;&gt; Well, tell me what you&#x27;ve seen. Well, um I&#x27;ve seen many uh while flying uh but um probably some of the more interesting ones I&#x27;ll say uh would be an orb appearing in front of me that uh not too far that would seem that it would be another airplane let&#x27;s say about the same altitude bright quite large larger than It would be an airplane that would have its landing lights on because at up at altitude with the landing lights on, it could appear like an UFO, but this would be larger than that and I&#x27;d be observing it.</p>
<p>This particular one, looked at the co-pilot and he seen the same thing. In this particular case, I was about to ask air traffic control LA center at the time if there was a plane or something in front of us and then it didn&#x27;t materialize right in front of our eyes. Change colors like in the blink of an eye and then disappeared. That was one. Another one.</p>
<p>Um, we see again uh actually we&#x27;re observing the satellite up in the sky and then right in that same direction a little bit lower and much closer cuz I know what satellites look like, right? They were commenting, me and the co-pilot on the satellite that were observing. This light appears in front of us and I&#x27;ve seen many, like I said, over the years cuz I&#x27;m looking. People have asked me, Tony, why why is it that you see so many? I said, well, for one, you got to be looking. And I&#x27;m constantly looking because I&#x27;ve had an interest in this most of my life. So, anyways, this light, you know, just another light appeared in front right in front of us in the same direction that the satellite was at, but much closer in year.</p>
<p>And I said to my uh co-pilot, this was the first time he&#x27;d seen something like that. I said, &quot;Keep your eye on it.&quot; And uh I&#x27;d say maybe three seconds goes by and then it dimmed and then shot to the left. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Just like in a blink of an eye, &gt;&gt; right? [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Well, do commercial uh planes, do they have some sort of video recording equipment that happens or No, that&#x27;s not a thing. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;d have to pull out your cell phone and actually record it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, we talked about how you were a pilot for 25 years. I mean, yeah, 20 years ago, phones didn&#x27;t really have cameras. I get it.</p>
<p>This, you know, in the last five to 10 years, video cameras improved on iPhones and so forth. So, &gt;&gt; correct. &gt;&gt; Did you ever have a good quality cell phone with you where you actually pulled out your phone and recorded it &gt;&gt; during the day and night? No. But because I&#x27;ve shared my stories with colleagues, friends that are pilots, uh, and also mentioned to them, you know, have the presence of mind to pull your phone and record it. I do have pictures on my phone that friends have taken at night of lights.</p>
<p>And recently, there&#x27;s been a lot of reports of it. I mean, we&#x27;re hearing it all over uh from different sources of pilots actually recording these, but uh during at night, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference from the picture that I took from the stars out there &gt;&gt; and sometimes the flash on the will be on the phone. It just lights up the cockpit. Excuse me. But I have a very clear uh one of an orb uh on my way over to uh over the Pacific uh from the mainland to Hawaii &gt;&gt; that I recorded.</p>
<p>I mean, based on your relationship with uh Steven Greer and all the information that he shared over the years, do you think these are extraterrestrial machines or are they man-made, human-made machines that are made to look like something extraterrestrial? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a very good question. Uh, both. And I can tell you this might be a interesting disc, but plays into the C5, you know, work that we&#x27;ve been doing. There have been times that I&#x27;ll be in the cockpit, you know, looking at the sky at night usually, you know, and after usually on cross country, you know, transcon flights where we&#x27;re flying for hours on end and it gets boring after a while, you know, we converse, we chat, we talk, you know, in the cockpit amongst ourselves, visit, and then we run out of stuff to do. So, I tend to dim down the lights in the cockpit and uh and I look for shooting stars or skies out there and uh and I&#x27;ll often get into or did you know retired now so we&#x27;d get into a meditative state &gt;&gt; while flying a plane? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Do you don&#x27;t see anything wrong with it? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m in a meditative state right now. [laughter] But there&#x27;s also not 500 people depending on you being completely conscious during this time. You can fall asleep if you want and no one will be hurt. &gt;&gt; The metastate meditative state that I&#x27;m talking about is one of heightened consciousness awareness. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s the opposite of what you&#x27;re talking about.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s the opposite of what I&#x27;m talking about. &gt;&gt; 100%. &gt;&gt; Got it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, by the way, your best Top Gun pilots &gt;&gt; have that faculty.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I see what is just a hyper focus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Have you heard the term of being in the zone? &gt;&gt; Yes. Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about. &gt;&gt; Similar. Got it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I looked it up.</p>
<p>Commercial airplanes are equipped with AWR, airborne weather radar. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Right. Now, would this type of radar detect other ships close by? &gt;&gt; Not the radar. We have TCAST, which stands for traffic collision avoidance systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Ah, right. that detects other aircrafts, but not ET or man-made. &gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;re saying that this radar you had didn&#x27;t detect any of these ships? &gt;&gt; No. No. Uh, for one, they&#x27;re beyond the range of the coverage of uh &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, so they&#x27;re far off. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. I mean they and when I say far off the traffic collision avoidance system typically doesn&#x27;t go beyond like 20 30 40 50 miles you know uh &gt;&gt; miles. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So &gt;&gt; you say they&#x27;re farther than 50 miles. &gt;&gt; Well, some of them come in and I I say the radar, you know, the radar could go beyond that. &gt;&gt; But you&#x27;re describing these ships as being relatively close. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Well, some are in I would estimate to be in inner orbit.</p>
<p>Some of them could be in outer orbit, but some Yes. Uh close. The the one that I recorded during the day, I would estimate that it was maybe just a couple of thousand feet above us. But it&#x27;s really hard to know the distance or the size because you don&#x27;t have a reference point. you know, if there are clouds uh that, you know, are nearby that we know what their altitude is and it&#x27;s a on this side of the cloud, then we could estimate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But other than that, it&#x27;s just like really hard to know. You&#x27;re just guessing at that point. &gt;&gt; Well, uh, Dr. Steven Greer, it&#x27;s our third time. Definitely appreciate it and I appreciate you bringing Tony Ferrer with you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s out here helping. He&#x27;s a great guy. Been with our team for years and &gt;&gt; another another person. We have lots and lots of pilots on our team who are commercial. Yeah.</p>
<p>Uh we have American Airlines uh captain flies air press 321s on our team. We have a lot. When I go through airports, I get stopped a lot by pilots and they&#x27;ll pull me aside, tell me there&#x27;s account of what happened. Um so, uh yeah, it it&#x27;s there actually thousands of reported cases. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh they don&#x27;t make their way into the media or into any government reporting system. And u a lot of times when it&#x27;s a very close encounter uh the pilots uh don&#x27;t know what to do about how to report it and they&#x27;re often they&#x27;re told don&#x27;t report it or or they&#x27;ll report it and it just never makes it up the chain of command. &gt;&gt; Tony, did you ever try to report any of your sightings? &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Not correct. Because for one, you know, as a representative of the airline, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s [clears throat] not a subject that you want to be talking about publicly because it kind of puts you in a position that might not look good for the airline.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, what you&#x27;re saying is they might think you&#x27;re crazy and they fire you because &gt;&gt; that would be the worst case scenario. They would. No, I wouldn&#x27;t say that they would fire me, but you know, it it it&#x27;s not something that you would want to really be bringing up. Could you hand me the book, the not the hard cover, the other one? &gt;&gt; All right. This is this very famous air air airliner 747 heavy &gt;&gt; Japan Airlines flying the polar route from Paris to Tokyo.</p>
<p>The one of the best most documented cases in history. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This case happened in the 80s and it was on radar. It [clears throat] was on board. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was on ground military radar. It was on ground FAA radar and this the object was the size of an aircraft carrier that in one sweep of the radar could go from one direction to 180° over virtually teleported. Now this case that pilot because it got reported was put on desk duty by Japan Airlines until a friend of mine Dr. Richard Haynes who was with NASA uh Ames Research Center went over to Japan and said no this is real and the guy has nothing wrong with him but they actually penalized that pilot for reporting this. Now, interestingly, if you go into our briefing materials that we&#x27;ve given you, the briefing document anyone can get now or our archive, you&#x27;ll see that one of our witnesses is John Callahan, who was the senior the head of investigations and accidents for the FAA.</p>
<p>Pete gave me and I possess the original FAA radar and all the digital data of this event, not a copy. The CIA thought they confiscated the copy. He kept it when he retired, gave it to us, the disclosure project. So when I run into people who go, &quot;Where&#x27;s the evidence?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not our fault you don&#x27;t read. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not [clears throat] our fault you haven&#x27;t studied the subject matter.&quot; So I&#x27;ve I&#x27;m increasingly, look, I&#x27;ll be 70 in June.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sort of done with people who say there&#x27;s no nothing there there. I say, &quot;Why?&quot; Because you&#x27;re too dumb and lazy to study it, &gt;&gt; you know? Sorry, but I mean I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a little burned out. I didn&#x27;t even take this part out. But we have all this, right? Who&#x27;s looking at it, you know? So even when you put it on a silver platter and give it to members of Congress, they don&#x27;t have time to look at it and their staffers are so busy running around doing nonsense. So, this is where I think uh a team, a specialized team, special forces, former special forces under executive order, they&#x27;ll know where to go and they will get to the people and to the legal government of the United States.</p>
<p>All of this under control. We can do it. We know how to do it. We&#x27;re to do it. Now, we&#x27;ll see what the president does.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll see what Congress does. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s how we&#x27;re going to end it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s [laughter] how we&#x27;re going to end it. Let&#x27;s see what the president does. Dr.</p>
<p>Steven Greer, always a pleasure. Thank good looking forward to seeing you next time. &gt;&gt; Great seeing you in person. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And thank you, Tony, for coming and sharing your story.</p>
<p>Till next time. Till next time. Authentic.</p>
