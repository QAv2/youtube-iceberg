            <p>the jogan experience but it seems like with all respect it&#x27;s I feel like that&#x27;s what he wants to think do you know that he wants to think that they&#x27;ve always been here in their spiritual things and he might be right but it is also possible that there&#x27;s a life form that&#x27;s so Advanced that it can avoid detection anytime it wants and then slowly trickles out little bits of information to us whether it&#x27;s a crashed vehicle or letting a vehicle be seen or hovering over Phoenix do whatever the whatever it wants to do and then Fades away again and then every decade or so as human beings evolve it introduces more and more to the landscape which if you kind of looked at it on a graph seems to be the case and oddly seems to be the case that it&#x27;s like primarily happening in the United States like if you look at the difference between the UFO sightings around the world and UFO settings in the United States we&#x27;re locked in we&#x27;re we&#x27;re locked in I said this to you last time I think yeah yeah yeah when you asked me what do I think of aliens I was like I would be a lot more I would find it a lot more credible if it wasn&#x27;t all in North America also as an American I have to say it&#x27;s probably because we&#x27;re the [ __ ] and if I was an alien what am I going to do go to Czechoslovakia get the [ __ ] out of here I&#x27;m gonna go check out San Francisco like look at all the [ __ ] in the streets look at all the needles these people are crazy I think um there&#x27;s probably both things going on I I I think there&#x27;s probably some sort of extradimensional possibility that I think occurs during psychedelic drugs and during certain states of altered Consciousness that I have a feeling you&#x27;re you&#x27;re tuning into something that&#x27;s not always available but probably is always there and then there&#x27;s probably a physical element of things coming here from somewhere else because we do that it just seems so duhh like allegedly we went to the moon but we definitely sent Rovers to Mars we definitely send satellites into space and take incredible imagery of Jupiter we definitely do all that what why would we not think that another species would do that especially if they get to some position where they&#x27;re using some unique novel form of propulsion that manipulates gravity and they just they don&#x27;t even have to worry about g-forces just appear places which seems to be like what they think these things are doing have you heard about that there&#x27;s a story about this Chinese scientist that was working on anti-gravity and she came from China to the United States to work on anti-gravity and she was working on some anti-gravity propulsion system and then vanished like probably went back to China yeah I mean probably went back to China it&#x27;s like this is what they paid me to do yeah Ian that there&#x27;s a lot of people who vanish in China that&#x27;s the thing is but I don&#x27;t think she van she vanished from the United States I think she went back to China oh what and took the secrets with her I think that&#x27;s the worry is that this see if you can find that lady&#x27;s name it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a very interesting story I was reading about it the other day and I remember like someone you guys are perfect to talk about this because that would be the ultimate thing that you&#x27;d have to keep secret from another country because if you have Espionage if you have people that have infiltrated your universities and they certainly do and if you have people who have re infiltrated your military contractors and they certainly do we do it I&#x27;m sure they do it oh they definitely do I mean the southern border is the fact that it&#x27;s as open as it is yeah that&#x27;s a lot of them are coming through there of course yeah but if you if you&#x27;re making something that is an ant some sort of a gravity propulsion system and you&#x27;ve made a breakthrough you&#x27;re not going to put that on wired.com you&#x27;re not you know you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re not going to broadcast that on CNN you you&#x27;re going to tell anybody that cuz if the the other countries find out if the other superpowers if China and Russia find out that we have a some sort of a gravity propulsors everyone&#x27;s going to die yeah they&#x27;re going to steal all the information doesn&#x27;t make sense still disappear solving the mystery of huntsville&#x27;s brilliant anti-gravity scientist do ningling son ningle son talks about her mom&#x27;s career and Legacy along with the internet&#x27;s obsession with her disappearance so she when did she disappear I see she C the papers and 93 hold on right there stop right there in the late 90s she claimed to have created anti-gravity devices that were fully functional and this was big news in both scientific journals and Main mainstream press in 1997 Dr Lee continued to expand on concept and conduct more experiments she published papers describing the Anon anomalous weight changes in objects suspected over a rotating superconductor to say her work to referred to as taming gravity could change the world is an understatement taming gravity would drastically change the way we transport on every level humans could travel the world at ease and we could finally get our hands on those sweet hoverboards from Back to the Future so did she really do it so what happened to her in 99 Lee left UAH to start her own company AC gravity and commercialize a device based on her theories oh you [ __ ] up lady her colleagues obviously believed in her work as a chair of uh&#x27;s physics department Larry Molly uh also Departed the university to join her public record show that in 2001 the US Department of Defense gave AC gravity a grant for $448,900 to research the technology however these results were never published in fact Dr Lee never published anything again even though the business license for AC gravity was updated yearly through 2018 there&#x27;s no record of any further work done by the Company Lee&#x27;s career after 2002 is a subject of great mystery barely Sociables research turned up a document showing that she gave a presentation at the 2003 miter conference titled measurability of AC gravity Fields the miter Corporation challenges federally funded research for several excuse me manages federally funded research for several US Agencies at the conference she presented along with a Redstone Arsenal official from US Army Aviation Missile Command meaning that her research was still being conducted up to that point so where did she take off when did she disappear she they think she went to China this kind kind of goes on they don&#x27;t this is a bunch of like they&#x27;re not really sure and then in 2021 so it&#x27;s like two years ago three years look at this though an obituary popped up an obituary on a funeral home in just outside of Birmingham where she was like with this where she was and it didn&#x27;t say anything about her disappearance H um an obituary they say how she died I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know check it was it water torture I usually don&#x27;t say how in an obituary see wow there she is she passed away peacefully yeah right a little that&#x27;s a little sus more information about like how she would have conducted her life but but if you scroll back up what I was going to read a little bit more there&#x27;s something about her right there a little bit higher confirming her well-being that she was still working with the dod but was unable to talk about her work so she&#x27;s working with the Department of Defense he also told ventur that he was unable to get a working email address or phone number for her bro they probably made a breakthrough and that&#x27;s probably what happens when you make a real breakthrough they probably give you a very clear indication of how this is going to go from here on out you&#x27;re going to be completely isolated from the rest of the world you&#x27;re this is there&#x27;s no way we can trust that you&#x27;re going to tell anybody about this we&#x27;re going to have to [ __ ] everything you do and just you stop publishing you stop doing anything but here&#x27;s the thing is that the wrong approach to take is that the wrong approach to take when you when somebody has created something that could be such a Monumental tool potentially a weapon that an enemy or somebody you perceive to be an enemy could use it against you I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the wrong approach to take I mean I think if you especially if you&#x27;re dealing with someone who came over here from China it&#x27;s like where is she going like keep an eye on that lady if she really cracked it and she cracked it with what if she&#x27;s sharing that&#x27;s the thing is like some of these drones that they&#x27;re seeing and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always assumed that a lot of these things are especially the the the the square within a sphere that seems to they keep finding she&#x27;s disappeared and gone back to China said Safari she was working with NASA in the Redstone Arsenal but she disappeared for several years now the people at the Pentagon cannot reach her anymore she&#x27;s allegedly back in China and the Chinese are pouring money into similar experiments now uhoh that&#x27;s why our intelligence guys are very interested the most likely people to develop the first anti-gravity propulsion technology are the Chinese that&#x27;s TR Shing wow that&#x27;s crazy that&#x27;s a crazy statement the most like when someone says that publicly go that go back to sorry again Jamie the most likely people to develop the first anti gravity propulsion technology are the Chinese the fact that he&#x27;s saying that if you&#x27;re saying that publicly that means they&#x27;re probably on it yeah just just a scientist though it wasn&#x27;t I know but if that lady really did crack something and really was able to make things hover God damn it and it was as far back as what 93 mhm well 2004 was that big sighting Commander David fraver when he found that thing that looked like a Tic Tac that was hovering over the water and disappeared at an insane rate of speed they got video of this thing different fighter jets saw it they said this thing just took off just no visual means of propulsion there&#x27;s no windows no Rockets just just gone and there&#x27;s video of it there&#x27;s video of this thing just moving at this insane rate of speed that would turn human bodies into Jello I think it&#x27;s a drone I think they probably had a few of those I think they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve been wor that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re always occurring around nucle around military bases like San Diego is filled with military it&#x27;s all military out there so if they&#x27;re off the coast off the uh the they&#x27;re near the nits right so there there there&#x27;s [ __ ] all sorts of tests and training things that&#x27;re they&#x27;re running out there that&#x27;s what they do of course that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re going to train their [ __ ] drones too of course it&#x27;s we&#x27;re going to if if you&#x27;ve got some crazy high tech thing and you want to see how do the fighter jets see it like what do you [ __ ] don&#x27;t tell them and you put it in the ocean and then you say fly over there and they fly over there and they see this [ __ ] thing that can go from 50,000 ft above sea level to zero in like a second like what are we watching man it&#x27;s so crazy some of the stuff that human beings are coming up with I don&#x27;t know if you know this the Russians have a tunami torpedo have you heard about this it starts tsunamis yeah oh great it&#x27;s a tsunami torpedo Jamie would you so fun bye Malibu it&#x27;s basically a nuclear torpedo it explodes underwater causing a tsunami which can wash you know half the United States off the half the United States well if it hits the Seaboard on both sides yeah I mean it would be harder for them obviously from the East but from the West oh my God you can wash off you know all of California just like well you could do that down here too then you could do it in Texas you could do it all over the country right all over where the water is Russian TV news agenc oops God damn it um Russian uh news agency reported that Russia had produced the first set of nuclear-powered very longrange nuclear armed Torpedoes known as Poseidon strategic experts are warning that the posidon Torpedoes would have the potential to devastate a coastal city causing radioactive floods and result in millions of deaths oh [ __ ] dude thousand look at this haunted I knew you like this like this news outlets have painted a hauntingly vivid picture of a towering one ,000 foot tall radioactive tsun I know you wrote tabloid I know tabloid news but but is that possible a thousand foot tall radioactive tsunami violently crashing into British Shores pulverizing everything in its path and transforming the whole cities into Barren lifeless lands isn&#x27;t the the kind of power that they have now is what how much more powerful are they than fat man and little boy it&#x27;s a lot right yeah of magnitude I think the hydrogen bomb is way more powerful than the the atomic bomb so if they have like some top of the food chain best of what we&#x27;ve got today nuclear weapon and they detonated into the ocean what does that look like yeah you I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen those those tests they did when they blew up atomic bombs in the ocean you get to see like how high the water goes into the sky bomb this got Declassified not too long ago wow this is a Russian bomb that they have did they drop that in the water I don&#x27;t is that water no they&#x27;re way up in the clouds there oh my God look at that isn&#x27;t it kind of ironic that the thing that might kill us all looks like a mushroom but that&#x27;s the thing they might save us all and the thing they might kill us all imagine if that&#x27;s what God&#x27;s trying to tell us and that&#x27;s 1961 so this is the only thing that&#x27;s going to keep you from nuking each other yeah mushrooms Chow Down Boys imagine imagine if God&#x27;s trying to tell you that like through through the most horrific thing that human beings can do the indiscriminate murder of hundreds of thousands of people instantaneously yeah maybe that&#x27;s what we need to do we need to actually basically just before everybody gets the power you&#x27;re going to do a mushroom trip you&#x27;re going to connect to the spirituality of the earth you&#x27;re going to connect with your fellow human beings you&#x27;re going to understand that we are all one and then you&#x27;re going to be allowed to do your job and then you&#x27;re going to drop out of the race I don&#x27;t want that job or you give him to B and he I have to tell people what to think and what they can and can&#x27;t do yeah there there certainly some strange battle that&#x27;s going on right now that I don&#x27;t think most people were aware was going to ever take place no no I think that&#x27;s part of what the problem is what is this the video of this the 1961 SAR bomb yeah like means king bomb king of I me bro imagine being that guy in that plane going I am getting cancer for sure for sure do they even know they&#x27;re getting cancer probably not probably not</p>
