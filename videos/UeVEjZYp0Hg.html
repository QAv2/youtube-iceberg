            <p>have you ever heard of scalar energy it&#x27;s a type of energy that&#x27;s different from the electricity we use every day see electricity is made of two things electric field and magnetic fields and they don&#x27;t always play well together they can be like two kids who can&#x27;t agree on a game to play but with scalar energy the difference is that scalar energy is like a spiral staircase with two parts that work together perfectly and what we can and when we can tap into scalar energy amazing things can happen it can help us feel balanced and connected some people even use crystals to help them access scalar energy yoga and other practices can also help us tune into this powerful force so if you&#x27;re interested in discovering the power of scalar energy follow our page and check out our podcast episode with Tom Palladino another example of scalar energy in nature is our own double helix DNA so this is a holy thing</p>
