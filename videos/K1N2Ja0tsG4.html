            <p>hello viewers today I will explain the spinning mechanism of the turbine and I will I I managed to get all the parts which are let&#x27;s say important and now we will see which which goes where and how do we Mount this and how do we prepare this that it can be used on the generator so where do we start this is the rotor this is the the the part which we have to cut from the from the metal plate uh with water of course because we don&#x27;t want that this is not perfectly shaped um and not to be bended yeah and uh if you can see over here we have some small Edge and this is the space where goes the magnets yeah so this is the space where we Mount the magnets small Edge that magnets do not uh run us into the inside because they&#x27;re glued with strong Glu in okay they can uh yeah sleepers yeah easily so what do we have here this is the main basic shaft yeah so so where do we get this part so I explained in previous videos this part you get from the from the car rear Shaft or Car rear Bridge how you to however you want to call it and you Dismount that from the car rear shaft and then you need to cut this Edge yeah over here if you see my finger somewhere over here because we wanted that this part uh this part over here goes through this hole yeah because this will be below and what then of course on this uh shaft it&#x27;s mounted uh we have the conical bearings I explained them in one video so it they goes like this after that this is the main part on which the car car we spins yeah this is the main part it has holes and this goes onto this shaft on this conical bearing yeah you see I will Mount this and now you see it&#x27;s already spins and we have the upper part magnet but it goes the opposite way yeah like this we have the secure plate and we have the the screw for screwing that all this goes to the some kind of tempor this is temporary shaft it&#x27;s not the the final one which hold passing yeah and now this all can spin this plate on which our our magnets mounted goes below because I cannot put now that it goes below and it&#x27;s screwed not on this hole actually but we have to you can see on the images on the main video that we have have 10 holes on this holes it will go our support support for the wings on this holes these bigger holes on which on which is the the car wheel mounted yeah and we need another set of holes so in between and this would go onto these holes but let&#x27;s say now in in between I cannot show it so in between will be holes and they will be put through this holes over here yeah this holds between through this and on on this part it goes our support for wings oh it&#x27;s heavy and this is the mystery now everything spins this complete mechanism it&#x27;s explained and uh this is all what you need to know yeah so okay these are all the parts now or the parts which are important to be our that our turbine it&#x27;s going to be functional and yeah if if I miss something I apologize for my bad English maybe because these are let&#x27;s say hard uh Notions and I do not know all of them because I&#x27;m uh I&#x27;m electrical engineer not the the mechanical engineer it&#x27;s a difference but I tried to to explain with the Notions I know so thanks for watching on to next video bye-bye</p>
