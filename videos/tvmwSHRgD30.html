            <p>hello and welcome to the reciprocal system of physics a new way to look at an old Universe with physicists Bruce Perrette and Gopi Vijaya this is the first in the center for anthroposophical Endeavors realignment of science webinars I&#x27;m Ann Nicholson the center&#x27;s program director and I&#x27;ll be your host about the presenters Bruce pared PhD has a comprehensive background in computer science and electrical engineering he&#x27;s a full-time researcher of the reciprocal system focusing on the foundations of electrical Theory Gopi Vijaya PhD works with experimental and theoretical semiconductor physics he&#x27;s engaged in postdoctoral research of the reciprocal system as a way to bring gertian thought into modern physics if you had a chance to read gopi&#x27;s paper preparing for the reciprocal system he points out that the Sciences are suffering from a gap between assumption-based and model-based approaches this is where the reciprocal system can bridge that Gap a quick note about our format the presentation will be divided into short sections with breaks in between for questions and answers you can submit questions at any time by clicking the Q and A icon on your screen and during the breaks we&#x27;ll answer them live okay let&#x27;s get started all right hello everyone thanks for joining us I&#x27;m going to start sharing the presentation hopefully everyone can see it because you&#x27;re not doing it &#x27;ll go yep there it is I&#x27;m just gonna slide all the way yeah you can talk all right so reciprocal system of physics new way to look at an old universe now what are we looking at when we are trying to look at a different way at physics so the first thing is to talk about the reciprocal system itself this method of doing physics was actually inaugurated by Dewey Larson back in the 50s with his first book the structure of the physical universe and I have the website link provided below for those who are interested but the most important idea that Louie Larson brought to physics was the concept of a universe based on the natural consequences of a ratio of space to time called motion in other words he was looking at the entirety of the physical Universe only on the basis of this one single unified concept and that is the big change that we will be describing further on in this presentation now obviously in uh looking at a theory of this magnitude what Larson created was something that can be called the first draft it&#x27;s not something set in stone it&#x27;s continuously developing and as of today we have a further iteration you could say a re-evaluation of the reciprocal system of theory the next generation of license research using 21st century Concepts and this was done by Professor Kevin from India and Bruce Barrett who&#x27;s with us today and it originally began in an attempt to explain that properties of black body radiation the important addition the two when rs2 if you will is the fact that angular or what an ancient Chinese philosophy is called Yen Concepts were also introduced in addition to Larson&#x27;s more linear kind of young system now with this as the fundamental uh introduction to the reciprocal system we have to understand how we look at physics in general and that is this particular conventional Theory way which we all kind of imbibe over our educational process the first thing we kind of assume is we always assume that content and container are different now this is the view of objects in the universe being like actors who play out on a stage a background of space-time so whenever we imagine something moving here and there we always think of this particular object moving in a background of space-time so this distinction is something we kind of taken Without Really examining it the background is separate from the objects The Observer is separate from both the objects and the actors so these are several levels of Separation introduced and when something does happen you&#x27;re trying to describe things in this particular way of looking at it that an actor did not do right and something unexpected happens then immediately an excuse gets created and this is the idea of force fields we&#x27;ll come back to this in a little bit but in the first place we try to understand what happens when this stage kind of idea and the separate background separate object separate Observer idea is not assumed and we start from a different point of view let me show you a quick clip in order to illustrate this further the first carrying particles exchange between matter particles are said to be virtual particles because unlike real particles they cannot be directly detected by a particle detector the people on this planet will swallow anything so in other words we have swallowed many things which we are not supposed to be swallowing and actually examine it in a scientific way what are these things that we have swallowed so looking at that what we have swallowed is for instance the idea of action at a distance whenever we are having phenomena that seem to fit more with the action at a distance kind of idea we tend to bend the stage using the idea of electric and magnetic gravitational fields so these are the things that for instance do not fit the stage does not stay put behind the actors whereas the stage actually starts participating in the phenomenon and similar problem is seen is faster than light motion for instance when phenomena happen which don&#x27;t very neatly fit within the Einstein view where everything that happens is less than speed of light then a lot of anomalies are seen and in order to fit these anomalies in for every single anomaly A New Concept is introduced ad hoc for instance you have black holes you have white holes you have all interesting properties of millisecond pulsars again we are trying to resort to bending the stage to make it work but is there a way where you do not try to bend the stage because what we don&#x27;t see still affects us the background is no longer something that sits neatly behind us so this is the point at which we kind of stopped this preliminary intro and really start diving into what it means to have a universe of motion so let me pause for a couple of seconds to see if there are any questions at this point and then I&#x27;ll continue on from here okay there are no questions from the audience at this point goby um it&#x27;s really it&#x27;s something that you&#x27;re that this theory is is challenging a lot of the things that those of us who have um what we thought was a modern scientific conception we&#x27;re really going to have to take a new look at things exactly yeah the idea is not that we necessarily have to uh you know build up a new Theory again in an ad hoc manner the perceptions and the facts remain the same but the interpretation becomes much more coherent that&#x27;s kind of the aim of this whole system Gopi we had a question come in what does this do for the concept of rest Mass press pass rest mass is well for that you have to understand that the very idea of Mars is extremely tied to the idea of an object in the stage so when you&#x27;re looking at mass in the terms of reciprocal system it turns out to be something else so I will try to come back to that once we have gone through a good part of the presentation keep in mind and try to come back to it I&#x27;ll remind you all right anything else no let&#x27;s move on alrighty so the reciprocal system now the unique thing here is everything is a ratio of space to time no exceptions that means the actors which are the objects are a ratio of space to time this stage or the environment is a ratio of space for time and the Observer of a few are also a ratio of space to time so it&#x27;s one concept applicable everywhere now the reason for doing this is described a little bit more in my paper on preparing for the reciprocal system where when you look at how measurement is done in modern physics no matter what the physical quantity involved is in each case whether you&#x27;re measuring mass or you&#x27;re measuring charge or you&#x27;re measuring anything any other intensity energy or things like that you ultimately come back to measuring some particular quantity of space or a frequency a quantity of time so when the measurement process intrinsically involves these two quantities what happens if we start with them while looking at our Theory so rather than trying to fit everything back into spatial and temporal terms what if we start with it so that&#x27;s the idea of the reciprocal system and now since everything is the ratio of space to time the ratio of space to time is what we typically call motion so the ratio of motion so basically when you&#x27;re looking at space to time as a ratio the motion there are only two options the two differentiations possible one is you can throw it another you can spin it there&#x27;s no other choice for instance whenever you&#x27;re thinking of say throwing a baseball the movement is something that happens in a straight line traditionally and philosophically associated with yam hot masculine and it is what is traditionally used to define location as well you say you see a ball move across and you say huh that&#x27;s where it is so the very movement is what helps create its position in space That&#x27;s the basis for us measuring it on the other hand angular motion is different because in this case the location does not change the rotation occurs in place it&#x27;s more on the yin and the cooler than the feminine side and not only does it stay in place it also defines structure in other words both movement and what we would call an object or a structure they are something there&#x27;s two sides of the nature of motion itself and when you pursue that concept further it comes to the idea that you can have motion without something moving absolutely Preposterous idea to start with at least that&#x27;s the first impression how can you have motion without anything moving that&#x27;s the number one question that trips up almost all students of the reciprocal system and the reason is we are still thinking as an actor on a stage because when you actually look at it the motion is basically how we are measuring chain something is changing now when you have say the wind around us we don&#x27;t normally perceive it right it just blows past us it&#x27;s a linear Movement we badly detect it but when it really ramps up and starts circulating in place then you have a tornado so when you have a tornado there is no question that it is something everybody agrees it&#x27;s a pretty powerful thing but what has happened is motion that used to be linear has kind of focused itself in rotational form and so both things are still motion so the reciprocal system is based on identifying these differentiations of motion you can almost call it a kind of topography a kind of landscape of motion and therefore it is based on an abstract change in multiple Dimensions not as things moving okay let me pause once again over here to see if there are any questions so far well can you talk about what you mean by the word abstract because I think you mean something very specific here not what maybe uh is commonly the common definition of that term yeah so when you&#x27;re talking about abstract well abstraction means that you&#x27;re going um a conceptual level higher than what you normally deal with for instance when you just say a blanket rule motion right it covers everything but then you have to abstract certain features out of it when you say just a landscape a landscape is a landscape but then you start differentiating things you say there&#x27;s a hill there&#x27;s a valley there&#x27;s other features height changes and things like that these are abstractions that you get from the landscape and in a similar fashion what is happening here is the same way that you&#x27;d have a topography you have a three-dimensional Universe in the same way you have your topography but with motion not static objects but actually movements and motions differentiating themselves into multiple dimensions that&#x27;s kind of the meaning of abstraction over here so you&#x27;re talking about map making here yeah yeah different kind of map mapping making with the everything being in motion so that takes that takes a little getting used to it because we have had so many centuries uh programming to think in terms of static objects that it&#x27;s kind of hard to think of motion being the first thing okay we&#x27;ve got two more questions here one is about scale in relation to rotation and linear motion what is the scale yes can you talk about scale here measurement and scale in relation to rotation and linear motion well think about it this way where you have predominantly rotational motion you end up in what is called the quantum scale and that is the layer where all of us are very familiar with the ideas of atoms and systems and basically the stuff of a physical Universe right but when you&#x27;re actually looking at it more carefully even in the most fundamental equations of quantum mechanics you&#x27;re actually still talking about rotations so you you even have spins you have so many different ideas where people are trying to get the Topography of rotational motion so a typical uh scale for rotational motion is that of atoms and I&#x27;ll come back to this later again that is that&#x27;s not the only one you also have international units yeah you also have the idea of uh rotations coming when you&#x27;re looking at astronomy so I&#x27;ll come to the meaning of that uh towards the end of the presentation but the thing is here you have an idea called natural unit so the scales are determined by what you choose as the natural unit for your physical system and I will describe what is The Logical Choice uh based on the phenomena for this natural unit further on it will turn out to be related to the light speed which is the scale for many things okay excellent we&#x27;ve got one more question um this one is about warmth or heat and uh that&#x27;s considered to be you know the uh the Primal uh quality of matter in some symptoms so uh is is this really uh about identifying that Primal phenomenon it is uh identifying the primary phenomenon but because we are starting with a different sense we are starting with the sense of the eye the sense of vision so the sense of warmth if we would start there we would develop another coherent kind of way of looking at things but in this uh way of looking at it we are starting with something you can very clearly observe and then the explanation of warmth also comes out through understanding uh motion itself so the two things are complementary but for the sake of the bridge needed with conventional physics we are starting with light and movement okay excellent let&#x27;s move on and I know you&#x27;re going to answer more of our questions as we get deeper into the presentation yep I hope so all right so moving forward we looked at the idea of the state getting back and here what we are having is say two um you know poles of a magnet and your sprinkle iron filings and the iron filing somehow seem to arrange themselves in a particular pattern what is moving design filings magic we all know as kids we&#x27;re fascinated with magnets and the thing is there is no specific um object between the pose which is creating the system there&#x27;s there&#x27;s no tiny little billiard balls pushing all the ion filings in the specific way but the entirety of it moves in a specific way so in other words the field effects which we perceive as pushes and pulls are just the expression of outward and inward motion so when you see that something is affecting another thing if that&#x27;s that&#x27;s traditionally how we put uh the sentence this effect is also a consequence of motion how do you know something is there because when you&#x27;re trying to push at it it pushes back says this interaction of pushes that is the basis for us to say that something actually exists so all of it the so-called actors also turn out to be just modifications of motion or they&#x27;re just change now actors between these posts just change so motion can in this sense be viewed as pressure just like I was telling you as a push and a pull everything in the universe can be viewed as a pressurized system no leaks no change motion is a constant speed what the universe seeks a steady state so in other words the steady state is not stasis the steady state is Dynamics it&#x27;s movement and when the movement kind of gets accelerated in a way then you have over pressurization and when that kind of goes the other way you have a suction or a leakage so the leaks create change and seek to balance themselves by finding an opposite chain so the over potentialization and the leaking the push and the pull the positive and the negative North and the South are so many other Concepts that are used in physics oxidation States balance all of these things are simply showing us how this fundamental idea of polarity or reciprocity is expressed in the physical universe so carrying forward this idea of push and pull the steady state path which I didn&#x27;t emphasize earlier that steady state is what we are looking at here motion is defined as speed you know the multiplicative inverse of space to temperature the minimum amount of motion is one Unity now here is where a conceptual shift is occurring when you&#x27;re looking at a universe which is passes or static you tend to normally start with zero for everything you have an origin in the Cartesian reference system you have a vacuum say for instance when you&#x27;re looking at pressure system everything is dealing with zero to start with temperature absolute zero so on and so forth but when you are looking at Dynamics or movement as a fundamental basis then the minimum amount has to be one there has to be movement for you to do anything with it and the universe must contain the minimum motion this one this unit speed as an outward push as a general progression so you can have the average State as a general progression and the balances are the progression things overreaching the progression and things kind of reeling back from the progression so the data or the basis line so to speak for the reciprocal system is this progression of the natural reference system and it is identified with the speed of light so what happens where do we see this for instance we&#x27;ll push if the minimum quantity of motion the outward push is always present you should be observable somewhere in fact it actually is on in the two images the one on the left you see the typical motion which we are all very familiar with gravity you drop something it falls to the ground pretty simple and it points towards the center of the earth however at the beginning of the 20th century a completely unprecedented motion was discovered what was that the fact that all the galaxies are going away from the earth almost all of them and this was completely surprising and puzzling to several scientists because they could not figure out how all of them could be moving away and this ignored fact it was ignored for four centuries actually ever since the time Newton introduced the ideas of gravity this particular ignored fact turns out to be the opposite polarity which is required to be present when you are starting with the yin Yan system or a balance system so what you&#x27;re attempting to do is to make up for things which tend to get missed when you only see one side of the coin and there are other things too uh conventionally conventional science typically is full only all right so it has several problems explaining things when push comes into play for instance I already spoke about Galactic recession another ex um very common phenomenon that we don&#x27;t really know the true reason for in conventional science is thermal expansion when you heat something on the stove why does it expand why does a metal expand almost photographically when you heat it up Believe It or Not conventional science has absolutely no reason given for that when we are talking about all the jiggling molecules and how things are shifted from the equilibrium position when you look at it very carefully you realize nothing can actually move away from its equilibrium position you need something else coming in you need a push an outward push and that&#x27;s what thermal expansion is intro Atomic repulsion If gravity was the only force acting you should have all of the universe getting together and clumping into an infinitely dense spot that does not happen when you push on a hard object it resists what causes its repulsion what causes inter-atomic repulsion this again has no answer even with the most advanced quantum mechanics another thing what happens is extrapolation failures so extrapolation is very simply saying that okay if something has increased while I increase another parameter then it will continue to increase while I keep increasing the other parameters say a kid is growing and he&#x27;s growing at a certain rate if he grows five centimeters in the first in one year you would extrapolate and say he&#x27;s going to grow another five centimeters in the next year but as you can see such failures happen because the kid doesn&#x27;t continue to keep growing to several feet tall it stops and this stopping and then even losing height which happens in old age this kind of principle is what it introduced in the reciprocal system extrapolation doesn&#x27;t continue indefinitely everything goes to a certain point hits a limit and goes in the other direction so all of these are features of the conventional signs which are not explained and which tend to get explained when you take both sides of the picture and you stop missing half the picture so this is where we have to start balancing rebalancing our physics and try to include the properties which we have almost by default left to the side so restoring the balance on the left side I have the pins which we tend to know quite well we know that gravity acts inward like towards the center of the earth we know that similar charges repel and we also know that similar magnetic poles repair right these things don&#x27;t add Traditions same charge repelling same pulse repelling system yeah similar so now when you have outward recession that&#x27;s a puzzle and something else which is a puzzle is similar charges attracting now you might not have typically heard of this but this is used pretty heavily when trying to understand superconductivity where electrons are actually paired up things which normally should fly apart are put together and the same thing in the so-called Atomic nucleus one even there you have several charges put together and nobody explaining to you why they are putting together when traditionally they should be flying apart so it always seems to explain one part of the system the most astonishing thing uh to see visibly is the stuff with magnetic poles on the left side I have the image of North Poles repelling each other as it happens with a typical magnet but on the right side you have the two North Poles of a sunspot clumping together so rather than repelling they&#x27;re currently so completely unprecedented all the stuff on the right is something that takes here is a lot of effort to fit within their system because they don&#x27;t start with a balanced system as you continue balancing the system there are other things somebody was asking earlier about heat and light so when you&#x27;re looking at light outward radiation you know when you have a candle and you see very cleanly that is very bright as you close to it and as you go away the light intensity decreases this is the typical property of outward radiation but there is another thing that&#x27;s happening in our physical Universe called inward radiation it&#x27;s also called Cosmic microwave background radiation now in the middle of the last century people found out that from all directions surrounding the earth there is radiation coming inwards to us radiation that is so uniform that when you actually try to calculate its temperature it goes up to the fourth decimal place without any variation absolutely uniform inward radiation that through all of them into a big quandary because they could not explain inward radiation so they had to come up with other ideas like big bang which has basically exploded a long time back and somehow you&#x27;re seeing the residue so that threat to fit a particular hole the idea of the Big Bang had to be introduced but if you look at it this way it&#x27;s simply the polar opposite of outward radiation and similarly the thermal gradient is an astonishing thing once again with the Sun thermal gradient when you go closer to a candle the greater the chances of you burning your hand as simple as that because it&#x27;s hot as near the candle and cooler as you go away but in when you look at the sun the surface of the sun is actually cooler than the surrounding Corona which you tend to see during eclipses so in this case the heat gradient is completely reversed it&#x27;s hotter away from it and cooler at the surface this astonishing reversal is once again something that is very difficult to explain in terms of conventional physics this whole method of looking at physics in a balanced way was actually inaugurated back in the early 1800s by Johannes with his ideas on color polarity he saw a similar balanced system with respect to the Prismatic Spectrum he did not look only at the left side of the slide for instance where this is a very common image that is spread all over the scientific Works where you have a wide beam of light coming in through the prism and splitting into colors and you have the typical rainbow spectrum that you see on the left on the right however go to put the inverted Spectrum where a dark beam is passing through a well-lit white background and that also gives some colors that gives you the cmy the printer color cyan magenta and yellow now funnily enough physics has tried a lot to fit this particular magenta color within our system and failed at it because what is happening is something that creates certain conditions for green to appear if you invert it physically you should get magenta but our theory is only made for the green our theory is not made for the magenta so the usual explanation given is magenta is just made up by your brain whereas green is actually observed so these kind of asymmetries start getting introduced into the whole uh you know understanding of the system so when you actually take this into account and take polarity not only with color but with all other phenomena then you start getting a system which is balanced intrinsically and that&#x27;s what we are calling the reciprocal system I&#x27;d like to pause once more over here and open the space for a few questions but we have one question uh that that came in about uh the phenomenon of scale as a primary are there three primaries um linear angular and scale I&#x27;ll be talking about scale in a minute if the person with the scale question could hold for a second another thing you want to mention here is uh green has a frequency green has a frequency yeah trying going trying Google on frequency for magenta yes that&#x27;s a good exercise if you try to go and Google the frequency for magenta you will see all the evasions that are possible by the human mind put in front of you but because of the system here magenta has to have exactly the same frequencies screen except that it&#x27;s the inverse polarity yep so in a way you have 180 degrees yeah you can have like positive and negative frequencies the idea is like that introduced here so that expands expands it from Simply a scale really to a circle right we talked about that during our run through that gerta&#x27;s color theory is really he portrays it in a circle exactly so the difference between the traditional way of looking at it which is linear and gerta&#x27;s way of looking at it into the circle is the circle meets a line only at one particular spot so you have many different ways of orienting the circle so there are in fact as many physical theories as there are points on a circle which is infinite so the idea of making a linear scale means you also tend to start from zero and go on towards Infinity but when you&#x27;re starting with a circle you&#x27;re having one single unit there&#x27;s an inside of the circle and then the outside will Circle so the way in which approaches color theory was intrinsically the same data that the reciprocal system uses it&#x27;s unit data not zero so that&#x27;s yeah that&#x27;s an additional point there well we we also talked about the Big Bang here during this this last segment and really the rst calls that into question doesn&#x27;t it Go Pete because what is happening is the Big Bang well think about it a bang is an explosion it&#x27;s once again a young phenomenon so they&#x27;re trying to express something that is actually gin by using terms which are actually young which doesn&#x27;t fit really so the only way to escape it is to put that bank far back in time so it&#x27;s so far back in time that you don&#x27;t see it anymore you don&#x27;t experience it anymore and then you can kind of do hand waving and call that you know your incoming radiation so what you&#x27;re actually seeing is the lack of uh inversion the lack of willingness to actually invert the phenomena even though the observations are calling for it so does rst give us any indications about the beginning of the universe or about uh what to expect if there&#x27;s going to be a heat death or a cold death at the end of the universe in terms of the reciprocal system we have a cyclic universe so there is as much heat as there is cold and the two mutually recirculate into one another and you must also think about another idea of time which we have not touched on in this presentation hopefully we do it at another time when you have the idea of time beginning then you&#x27;re reaching a completely different uh level of Concepts over here we are not looking at things in that way we are just looking purely at the physical happenings around us and seeing okay everything appears to be different forms of motion and motion has two aspects based on time we are not divorcing time and space as two separate things to be treated differently so questions of beginning in time beginning in space is not the current concern the idea is to find out how are these things balancing each other that is considered a steady state Theory yeah it is considered a steady state Theory yes okay excellent well let&#x27;s move on and you&#x27;re gonna get into scale with this next section all righty before the scale first of all we have to try to give a kind of understanding of what this new datum is what is the rationale behind choosing light as a new data now there are two uh fundamental processes that occur in the observable universe on the one side you have speeds now speeds are very uh what do you call observable in a way and energy is something that seems far more intrinsic when you keep increasing the speed that also is tantamount to an increase in energy now here&#x27;s an interesting observation that was seen that a lot of the particles that they observed coming in in the upper parts of the atmosphere they turned out to be having so much energy so much high energy that if there was no way of trying to find out how on Earth these things sped up so much the high energy particles were coming in very close to the speed of light and what is observed is that this high energy is something that forms a polarity to the low energy or the low speed side of the physical universe and when you start touching this kind of uh boundary of the speed of light then things start changing and the way the things change was not totally understood for example by Einstein who kind of reacted by once again warping the stage behind he did not understand that the concept that they would be used below the speed of light have to be reversed or inverted when you&#x27;re going past the speed of light so this is the main reason why none of us ever ever heard of speed of light as being in the center of a physical Theory it&#x27;s always kept at the far end of it and what I have shown over here in the diagram is when you start with one there are two ways you can go the ratio which is the motion can go upwards in terms of two is to 1 3 is to One n is to 1 on towards infinity or downwards one half one third one fourth onto it zero and now zero and infinity both become kind of limits which are never really reached and this is true almost all physical phenomenon when you say it is zero size a point is zero size that&#x27;s not really true because all physical things have a specific finite magnitude and similarly actual Infinity is never observed Infinity is the direction so between this extreme of zero and the extreme of infinity the one stands in the middle balancing the whole system and unit speed is what we call this data and the unit speed equals light speed gives us a physical uh kind of Link point to the whole system and so you can actually stop talking about just numbers like one two and three you can say one is the speed of light and all processes therefore have a limit just because the entirety of the physical universe is made of this two reciprocal sides whenever you&#x27;re crossing the unit boundary of any process the whole thing inverts and the reciprocal process starts acting so you have one side the other side and the balancing speed in the middle as the basis of the respiratory system so moving on to the idea of scales the interesting thing in respiratory system is since you&#x27;re looking at say push and pulls and things like that what happens within the atomic or the microcosmic system is very similar to what happens in the astronomical or the macroconic system for instance in the astronomical sense you have globular clusters where a lot of stars are you know kind of present in a globe and they&#x27;re equally kind of equitably distributed within the volume of the globular cluster what is happening there is where there&#x27;s pushes and pulls between the stars are balancing out enough to create such a structure the very same thing is also happening at the atomic scale when you get a whole array of atomic systems in this array of atomic uh lattice what is usually called a similar push and pull are balancing each other out so scalar over here means no matter which scale you&#x27;re talking about the fundamental physical processes remain the same so the concept is scale in variance and motion which has this property of invariance with scale is what we are calling scalar motion even if you change the scale the Motions uh qualities remain the same so by this is a very powerful idea because it um kind of provides the antidote to Modern physics which has things which are very different for different scales for the very small you have Quantum Mechanics for the very large you have say cosmology and general relativity for the things in the middle you have a whole hodgepodge of different things coming together when you&#x27;re having a physical Theory which is scale invariant that means the theory has the capacity to penetrate very different subjects with equal ease and that is what we call a coherent system the reciprocal system that&#x27;s why we call it a system and not just reciprocal theory for instance because everything that is happening in various subjects which are kind of go through is all very naturally tied together subatomic particles within the first book by Louis Larson called Nothing But motion he addresses several things which happen uh with subatomic particles he actually calculates from first principles the charge of the electron the mass of the electron what kind of fundamental particles can there be from Theory straight from Theory so and when you&#x27;re looking at nuclei I would call the atomic nuclei radioactivity was also examined with the reciprocal system showing how the radioactive decay and the nuclear radioactive decay products how they evolve what kinds are possible what is not possible all of which according to traditional science were mostly empirical but it was able to calculate that one of the most astonishing calculations that came out of the RS is calculations of inter-atomic distances for thousands of compounds in basic properties of matter which is another book Larson calculated just based on the balancing of the pushes and the pulls what the inter-atomic distances should be and this enormous field has not been parallel even with supercomputers and all the fancy stuff of modern science chemical bonding you don&#x27;t have hundreds of different types of bonding you have one simple Force equilibrium being formed and that explains all the different kinds of bond which is the chemical ionic covalent hydrogen bonding coordinate bonding what have you electromagnetism heat liquid state these are all more not so microscopic more on a human scale these phenomena also have a very clear explanation for instance why is electric field so much stronger than a magnetic field and why is the magnetic field so much stronger than the gravitational field questions like this why do why does the electronic specific heat for instance not take part in the specific heat calculations what&#x27;s the reason for that what is the actual reason for a state chain from solid to liquid and liquid to gas our usual way of understanding States is we kind of take the idea of solid billiard boss kind of all mashed together and we say okay if they&#x27;re all really matched really hard together then you have the solid state if they&#x27;re kind of loose then you have the liquid still if they are all dispersed then you have the gaseous state so you all always have this idea of solid balls infecting all over physical understanding but Larson goes through the development of the different states of matter how as I was telling you everything has its limit in a similar way the liquid state has its limit and then it becomes fugacious State So based on this idea Larson actually calculated boiling and melting points of so many different compounds from Theory once again an astonishing achievement it&#x27;s quantized District units yeah that&#x27;s what your minutes are because there&#x27;s no moving system correct so when you&#x27;re incorporating this idea of the limit that means everything becomes naturally quantized so you don&#x27;t have to kind of impose a quantum mechanics since it is naturally context and the limit comes in width within the theory that is one half of it and as you go more towards light speed and high energy then you move towards astronomy and high energy physics high energy physics what are the different magnitudes what are the different decays particle decays that occur in high energy physics once again derived by lasso then nothing but motion Stellar Evolution our very understanding of Stellar Evolution because we are looking at only one side of the coin we got it backwards Stars don&#x27;t evolve from Blue to Red they actually evolve from red to blue so Larson set the evolution right and that enabled him to explain a whole host of astronomical phenomena binary Stars The Peculiar nature of binary Stars which is kind of a living manifestation of the reciprocity you have a very big star very dull red color and you&#x27;re very tiny compact highly Dense Star and how do these things form come straight out of the system Supernova extremely high energy phenomena why does the globular cluster stay in that particular shape when according to traditional system everything should simply collapse in a big chunk all of this are explained and going much larger in scale Galactic structures how do galaxies interact what happens when they interpretate each other what is the nature of the electric matter is very important because Larson actually predicted the presence of quasars way before they were discovered if his theory was much more well known and the people have understood it this would have been a noble worthy achievement in itself leaving aside all the other things so the reciprocal system also helps you just from natural consequences developing the natural consequences you can actually predict what people will find in certain conditions in the universe and the centering thing in all of this is the light speed this is where things change and this is kind of what holds the fort it&#x27;s the it&#x27;s the boundary as kind of membrane between these two aspects of our physical universe so in other words you can almost think of the entirety of the reciprocal system as a description of how light is expressed in different gradations as the physical processes that we see around us now this idea that light is the fundamental uh kind of constituent of our universe is not as outrageous as it might first sound because it also came in a court by Rudolf Steiner where he looked at matter in the light of knowledge so let me read out this particular paragraph to you to emphasize the importance of it there is a fundamental essence of a material Earth existence out of which all matter only comes into being by a condensing process and to the question what is the fundamental substance of our Earth existence spiritual science gives the answer every substance upon the Earth is condensed light there is nothing in material existence in any form whatever which is anything but condensed light cannot be traced back to anything else in our material existence Wherever You Reach Out And Touch a substance there you have condensed compressed light all matter is in its Essence light so this is the fundamental message that we are trying to get across that is not simply an idea thrown in the middle of nowhere it has actual physical backing a lot of calculations and the condensation is what we were earlier describing as the different speeds the fractions and the multiples and so on all of them are simply different condensations of the slide so this reciprocal system of physics starts and ends with like and with that I&#x27;d like to come to the end of my presentation and open the door for questions okay good well it sounds like just to get us started Gopi that you and Bruce are saying that Larson has The Theory of Everything yes yes and it must also be uh specified that the sense the sense organ that we are using the sense of sight and the sense of touch Larsen put these two together in a beautiful way in his two fundamental postulates and use that to develop the entire Theory and that&#x27;s why earlier in the presentation we were trying to look at pushes and pulls and all of that so sense of touch and then light for the sense of sight the two together you get the reciprocal system well there&#x27;s something that you said in your paper preparing for the system where you talked about this Theory bringing inductive and deductive reasoning together in a way can you speak to that yes that is what is called phenomenology phenomenology means what it means that you&#x27;re not trying to impose certain ideas onto matter you&#x27;re not uh or on to the physical process you don&#x27;t have preconceived assumptions which you are bringing in so that means that uh the ex excessive deduction is not going on you&#x27;re not just assuming things out of a hat on the other hand the inductive Sciences right now what they do is they keep collecting the physical data but they do not have the organizing idea that can shed light on the whole system and bring coherence to it so you&#x27;re neither going towards the extreme of blindly collecting data nor are you going to the extreme of pulling ad hoc ideas out of a hat you&#x27;re trying to go the middle ground where every fact you are seeing it without assumption and allowing the fact to show uh the idea that it is carrying so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s phenomenology yeah we&#x27;ve got another question here um Rudolph Steiner describes warmth without matter as the primordial condition right those words relate to linear and rotation motion as primordial conditions right so what is happening is when Steiner is speaking about uh Womp uh he is talking about something that precedes linear and rotational and actually their interaction or if you are looking from the perspective of light bomp can only be expressed as the interaction of linear and rotational motion so even in uh reciprocal System One turns out to be a kind of vibration he calls it a linear vibration or something something like that I won&#x27;t go into it now but what happens is when something more primary gets expressed in a system that is at a different level then that more primary phenomenon comes at the boundary of the polarity that we have just been discussing so in other words it does not discount warmth as another starting point it only says where you reach when you start with light well you talked in your paper about how uh for instance euclidean geometry describes a certain um uh the phenomenon of touch seems to be related to this while um the phenomenon of sight is really a world of projective geometries exactly yeah that is the actually the contribution of both Bruce and nehru they were the ones who identified that you not only need reciprocal system in terms of speeds but you also need a reciprocal geometry and the pursuit of that idea actually led to incorporating projective geometry in the respiratory system and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s rst2 that Bruce and Dr Nero developed yeah yeah can you talk a little bit about both of you are active with mainstream science groups and have been for decades uh you have Bruce with the the international uh group for the unification of science right and that&#x27;s us yeah yeah can you tell us how uh how adoption of this theory is going in mainstream science yeah hate us very difficult the fundamental stumbling block is what I addressed in the very beginning that matter is being secondary and movement being primary very heartfeld to swallow for almost all of mainstream science so that has not gone down too well to be honest even though you know when I was doing the PHD and dealing with Concepts within conventional science it became very clear that once you peel away the layers of assumptions what is happening is very simply and straightforward manner explained by the reciprocal system so it&#x27;s not a problem of there being you know contrary data or all these kind of things the main problem is conceptual blocks the conceptual block of keeping movement prior to matter is is the block with respect are they need blocks to move around they will not accept just change yes yes by starting with bricks or legal if you haven&#x27;t got a brick you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t do anything yeah so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s usually the additive so it doesn&#x27;t matter electron proton even Photon you have a whole ton of ons uh all of which is the very basis of conventional science well people are attached to stuff right yeah yeah it makes people feel secure to have a lot of stuff yeah yeah I should come in that um we don&#x27;t have a lot of equations in Larson&#x27;s books and you spoke about that in your paper uh can you speak to how we can give more support for the theory by um giving detailed mathematical equations well the equations you see the idea what has been first people weave out the equation and then they try to fit it to the phenomena and Larson takes the inverse approach he doesn&#x27;t impose uh equations on stuff he derives the equations so that is why uh you don&#x27;t find a whole ton of equations in his books but we have extended that work quite a bit and many equations for instance the Schrodinger equation which comes in quantum mechanics can be derived straight from the reciprocal system and there is a reason for everything now we are not stuck with uncertainty principles you are stuck with reciprocal principles and you don&#x27;t have to kind of give excuses when you bring in imaginary numbers so in reciprocal system you have imaginary numbers coming out quite naturally so the way to promote this or to take this forward is yeah just just try to study the uh study license Works interact with us and we&#x27;ll try to take it forward now I want to ask both of you to imagine for a moment how not only Science and Technology might be different but culture and our understanding of ourselves if the reciprocal system of theory were the mainstream theory of physical reality yeah Bruce has done a lot with that I&#x27;ve extended the system well into metaphysics and spirituality it all turned out to be a natural consequence of this Theory everything we see or don&#x27;t see is there and it allows you to understand what is true with the Universe versus what&#x27;s been made up I think that&#x27;s probably the strongest thing the reciprocal system has even when New York businesses start these experiments and you see all these fancy papers you know well they&#x27;re lying because that can&#x27;t be there is not a natural consequence of this system um do you want to yeah and because it gives a very clear idea of what exists in the physical universe and once you subtract that out you get beyond space and time then you get beyond space and time which is again one more excellent book by Larson and that is kind of what actually leads over to anthroposophy when you&#x27;re looking at spiritual scientific Concepts they are just what Larsen began and just far more elaborate so yes the getting the physics right is goes a long way in getting the metaphysics right you need the foundation before you go that&#x27;s really incredible because you&#x27;ve just laid the groundwork for a culture that rests on truth yes it&#x27;s hard to hide false in the reciprocal system because if it&#x27;s not space to time it&#x27;s not motion it&#x27;s not going to happen yeah well you have an idea for another webinar yeah that we talked a little bit about um Gopi something about time yes we actually did not uh enter into that subject at all in this presentation because the reciprocity between space and time means that times properties also turn out to be very different than what we conventionally assume so hopefully for the same turn out to be the same in space so time has three dimensions yeah so that is the subject that we&#x27;d like to touch upon at another time okay we are going to look forward to that I want to thank both of you Bruce and Gopi and everyone who has attended this webinar please look for a follow-up email with a link to the recording we would like to have your feedback audience as we&#x27;re developing future webinars on the subject of Science and Technology and also subjects like psychology and social three-folding so please send your comments to admin at cfae.us we&#x27;d like to express our gratitude to Frank dalenhauer and the center for anthroposophical Endeavors the not-for-profit organization which makes these webinars possible please consider a gift of financial support at cfae.us thank you and good night thank you</p>
