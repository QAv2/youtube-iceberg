            <p>things to say about the B2 stealths bomber uh having incorporated essentially basically principles of electrogravitics to give it a form of lift um an additional kind of lift. So uh yeah, so I&#x27;m sitting with this colonel and I&#x27;m like here and he&#x27;s like closer to me than you are right now. And uh and also we were in a pretty crowded area so there&#x27;s like people milling about, you know, and I&#x27;m not recording anything. I&#x27;m just we&#x27;re just talking and uh I said have you heard this paper by Paul Lavallet talking about electrogravitics uh as part of the B2 and he he was so nice but at this moment he literally put his hand out like this stop and he looked this way and he looked this way and he leaned forward and he just whispered that&#x27;s and and he wouldn&#x27;t talk anything more about it and as soon as he said that I thought, &quot;All right, this got to be true.&quot; Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
