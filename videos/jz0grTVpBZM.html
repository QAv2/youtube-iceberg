            <p>UFO whistleblower David grush is calling out lawmakers over congress&#x27;s decision to strip key parts of the UAP disclosure act from the annual defense spending bill you know what we&#x27;re witnessing right now is quite frankly uh the greatest legislative failure in in American history you know you had a very strong Amendment um for government transparency on this issue whether you believe um my allegations or not uh you know this is a government transparency issue at large and you know the legislation was modeled off of you know previous government transparency um issues I mean so we had a mixed bag of success right um if we believe the conference report uh that was submitted uh last week section 1687 which uh effectively fences off money to a legal special access programs something that Marco Rubio Mark Warner and his staff on the uh Senate select for committee for intelligence Champions uh that did make it through uh conference and I do congratulate the Senators that pushed hard to make sure that that was not removed during conference to help further this effort it leaves the door open for anything that is quote National Security uh we get to keep secret 100% later in the interview grush had a message for his Skeptics including a bombshell about what he himself might know personally people who saw your big interview that aired here on news nation and who watched your Congressional testimony you know people who might not buy everything you&#x27;re saying who are Skeptics have said over and over again he has no firsthand knowledge he is just telling what someone else told him or telling what he read how do you respond to people who say because you don&#x27;t have any firsthand knowledge maybe we shouldn&#x27;t believe you well uh I couldn&#x27;t be very upfront about my firsthand knowledge until recently I got some other security approvals uh through the pre-publication and Security review process um and I did have some firsthand knowledge of some specific uh parts of the program uh I&#x27;m currently drafting an oped that I&#x27;m going to release in a few weeks and I will be discussing what I actually do know firsthand I I just could not overtly discuss it at the time including at the hearing because uhu the you know the Pentagon and the IC were sitting on some of my pre-publication and review uh paperwork at the time so I could not acknowledge that when you say you have firsthand knowledge you actually saw something yourself well uh the deeper description of what I know has been redacted they proposed a redaction in a pre-publication in Security review uh response a few days ago and um they&#x27;re telling me to withhold legally some of the firsthand knowledge I have but I&#x27;m allowed to generally uh discuss that I was read into a UAP related program director ly um by the US government well that is a bombshell indeed potentially just tell us yeah I me tell us here&#x27;s the thing do it no I mean I can&#x27;t you know he&#x27;s worried he&#x27;s going to get charged but sure but the the first half of this is all about um being frustrated that some of the um toothiness was stripped out of the disclosures that people are pushing for fine but what the second part is well I actually person personally know and I have restrictions on me that have precluded me from telling you everything that I know firsthand of these programs it is interesting that that hasn&#x27;t been more of an emphasis up to date as you&#x27;ve been advocating for disclosures more broadly because somebody in the government knows information but not to be like well just free me and let me speak my truth to not have revealed that that he&#x27;s under those kind of restrictions and that he does in fact have personal knowledge to this point I do think is going to strike some of his Skeptics as generating more skepticism you know if he uh if someone with some knowledge of some things wanted to just you know mail them to some reporters apartments with full guarantee that certain reporters would go to jail if it came to it rather than reveal who gave them that information I&#x27;m just saying yeah no at some point this is how it needs to be handled yeah like we have whistleblow I mean I don&#x27;t want to ever minimize when the gmen try to storm this studio will barricade the doors well not you know there there are people who deal in secret information and who have the experience in protecting whistleblowers in their privacy it is very difficult even experts sometimes mess up in that respect so again I don&#x27;t want to try to minimize the implications here but clearly gush is someone who feels very strongly about this who feels like it&#x27;s something of national importance of public importance who&#x27;s willing to risk some reputational damage over it and I know I know that reputational damage and kind of legal liability are two very different things but it there does seem to be this interesting sort of Gap um especially when there are people to whom you could leak information and be protected from some of the worst of the um legal consequences and and that&#x27;s frankly that&#x27;s the only way we&#x27;re going to make any progress on this because if it&#x27;s up to we&#x27;ll structure a bill that forces the government to disclose they&#x27;re still never going to do it I like I&#x27;m reading the about the UAP disclosure Act it requires the government to release records about uaps um within 25 years of their creation unless these records are found to be enough of a risk to National Security that they require further classification every single record will be found as such we have so much experience with this we have recent experience with this Congress passed in a bipartisan fashion and President Biden signed an order to release what the government knows about the origins of covid-19 this is very important question to me um it&#x27;s been reported by both independent journalists like Michael shellenberger and by the Wall Street Journal that um that the first people to get sick with Co were the scientists at that lab does the government have information s is that why the energy department has made that the it&#x27;s judgment that it&#x27;s more likely that it came from a lab leak what what what caused them to reach that conclusion what caused the other people the other agencies to reach different conclusions I would like to know I would like to see the raw intelligence not just a summary of what the government thinks all they released was a like a new document they made a new document to summarize what they think they know but not saying not the actual intelligence which is what we wanted Declassified because we at this point we all should have the right to know I want to know exactly why some aspects of the government and think one way and other aspects think other what what did they look at who have they talked to there&#x27;s no reason for us not to know that at this point it&#x27;s important it matters they&#x27;re never going to do it and that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s disheartening the JFK files are another example where they were supposed to be released in their entirety in 2017 during the Trump Administration and that still hasn&#x27;t happened under Trump or under Biden and again if I recall correctly there was one of those um kind of National Security type polls that you can drive a Chuck a truck through um and obviously the National Security interest of an assassination that happened half a century ago difficult to argue but certainly someone somewhere is Slow Rolling the release of those papers for whatever uh reason stated or implied so here we are uh and I don&#x27;t know that it helps I understand why grush in that moment in that interview would want to substantiate as Bon aades and push back against people who say that he&#x27;s crying wolf but I don&#x27;t know that if you think about it for a second that really helps his case his credibility case if he has first meaningful firsthand knowledge and hasn&#x27;t found a way to get it out to the public yeah maybe that&#x27;s unfair I don&#x27;t know you you let us know what you think about it we&#x27;re just saying we&#x27;re available we would do our best to whistleblowers I would go with someone with a little bit more expertise dealing with whistleblowers and confidence no don&#x27;t give anybody else a scoop come to us we we can deal with it all right stick around we&#x27;re Rising right after
