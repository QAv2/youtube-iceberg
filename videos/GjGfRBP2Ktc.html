            <p>[Music] [Music] revealed in upcoming episodes of this program are the contents of a recently Unearthed repository classified by the secret government the phenomen on archives [Music] [Music] [Music] many of us would like to believe that the achievement of greatness is rewarded if not monetarily then certainly through the even eyes of history in the next 60 Minutes you may be shocked to discover that at least one man whose accomplishments touch each of Our Lives on a daily basis has been virtually [Music] forgotten at the head of the 20th century Nicola Tesla a Serbian immigrant and inventor whose name is nearly forgotten catapulted our civilization into the new age the use of alternating current radio fluorescent lighting remote control and Robotics a total of 700 patents are all attributable to this one man on Thursday January the 7th 1943 at approximately 10:30 p.m. with the world engulfed in a struggle against the dark Forces of the Nazi war machine Nicola Tesla breathes his last dying alone in a small room at the hotel New Yorker outside the city is alive with his legacy glistening with the electricity from Tesla&#x27;s fully realized vision of a world powered by alternating current he was incredibly aware of the consequences of his scientific inventions and their impact on the total development of mankind Tesla is buried in relative obscurity a fallen giant of invention whose discoveries Remain the foundation for some of civilization&#x27;s most important scientific advancement he is one of the greatest Geniuses of the 19th century Edison was one level of of of of science but Tesla was many levels higher he was a lonely character researching independently outside mainstream science he must have appeared to the so-called normal world like a complete eccentric he gave our country a tremendous uh package of technology uh applications and wonders and and our lives are all our lives are collectively much better because of his work why has this great man been so neglected by his fellow scientists and the public perhaps the answers lie more in the works never realized by Tesla than in his publicly acknowledged achievements [Music] [Applause] Legend has it that Nichola Tesla was born at The Stroke of Midnight in 1856 in the midst of a dazzling electrical storm as a young man his greatest aspiration was to harness the power of Niagara Falls he achieved that dream and in so doing popularized alternating current now already half century after his death a mystery surrounds Tesla his contributions which were great in many have descended Into Obscurity why Nicola Tesla was a humanitarian a US Patriot and yes an unbridled genius though he has most often been personified as the quintessential mad scientist perhaps his only real misdeed was being born ahead of his time Tesla a Serb grew up in a small village in Croatia the son of a strict clergyman and a brilliant inventive mother with a photographic memory and the ability to learn six Languages by the age of 18 Tesla soon assumes his path in life as a gifted inventor he has an uncanny ability to visualize his inventions to assemble test and disassemble them to exacting Dimensions all in his mind either while awake or in his dreams from the time he was an early child Tesla had the capability to visualize something so intensely and so vivid that he simply couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between that and a real object in 1884 Nicola Tesla immigrates to the United States virtually penniless he presents himself to Thomas Edison and is hired immediately okay Tesla consider yourself introduced but when Tesla describes to Edison his intricate plans for alternating current and a polyphase motor system far more efficient than Edison&#x27;s direct current system Edison recognizes Tesla as a potentially dangerous competitor you know Edison just didn&#x27;t want anybody to get ahead of him even if he had a better system and this is the way it is when you get aggressive people working they they will destroy each other a prize is offered to anyone who can harness and transmit energy from Niagara Falls to Buffalo New York Edison does everything in his power to discredit alternating current and Tesla alternating current is a danger to human life start the generator you have just seen alternating currents in action despite Edison&#x27;s opposition Tesla&#x27;s AC poase system is adopted and in May of 1888 George Westinghouse hears about this remarkable inventor and buys the alternating current patents by 1897 both t and alternating current become a household name throughout the world he realized completely what would happen with the implementation of alternating current and electrification of the whole planet that it would bring tremendous change in human life in information in general even in the mental state of human [Music] beings despite his new notoriety Tesla is a pure inventor a great dreamer and does not actively pursue the commercial exploitation of his ideas his many remarkable breakthroughs in high frequency electricity including radar radio neon and fluorescent lamps are often attributed to others for instance Tesla&#x27;s invention of Shadow graphs a system for taking x-ray photographs predates the work of vilhelm renen Tesla&#x27;s fertile imagination enkindles theories for the internet and television years ahead of their time though these Visionary leaps are ultimately proven and manifest Tesla&#x27;s tendency toward exaggeration and the manner in which he announces his ideas to the press caus the inventor a good deal of public criticism we must be able to transmit scenes from other places over long distances pictures the news energy and why not matter too now we must liberate thought we must set it free of limitations that space and time impose on it and yet keep its principal character istics now and in future centuries a flamboyant and mysterious man always too eager to share his ideas with the world Tesla demonstrates his laboratory experiments to such friends and luminaries as Mark Twain the man was uh socially capable of hobnobbing with most elite people in the world at the time Mark Twain Westinghouse JP Morgan and from his acquaintances uh uh was able to to find an some of the most spectacular experiments in history as a publicity stunt Tesla would sit in his laboratory while massive bolts of electricity danced about him without the use of wires these Airborne streamers would freely illuminate the lamps held in Tesla&#x27;s hand and Tesla was the first person to really show how to transmit wireless energy through the air to ignite electrical bulbs or electrical tubes they were fluorescent tubes which he had in the room these tubes would respond to different frequencies so if he produced One frequency one group of bulbs would light and if he produced another frequency another group of bulbs was would light in 1898 while perfecting his patents for the invention of wireless radio transmission Tesla&#x27;s laboratory mysteriously Burns to the ground this fire destroys thousands of hours of work setting the inventor back years and costing him personally over a million dollar Tesla is horrified by the extent of the damage but his is a resilient spirit for while the hardware lay in Cinders Tesla&#x27;s remarkable mental abilities enabled him to begin the process of recreating his work in 1899 Tesla moves to Colorado Springs to experiment with terrestrial and Atmospheric waves out on the Prairie he pursues his passion for discovering sources of free energy both above and below the surface of the Earth while investigating a phenomenon known as the Schuman cavity he develops his theories for tapping Limitless sources of power that all people of the world may share surrounding the earth there&#x27;s a cavity that resonates at about 8 cycles per second and this cavity exists between the earth we&#x27;re standing on now and the bottom of the ionosphere about a 60 km Gap in this three-dimensional resonant cavity in that cavity you can transmit power electromagnetic energy at 8 Hertz with almost no attenuation the Schuman cavity is pumped or fueled at this time with megawatt of power from the lightning Strokes that are occurring many times a second on a worldwide basis it&#x27;s rather like a child who&#x27;s playing with a tether ball Tesla was so creative he envisioned uh using his uh Power transmitter to spank the ball put it great big ball of electricity if by analogy a pulse of electricity in the ionosphere and it would uh very weakly distribute itself all the way around the world and when it came around the other side just at the right moment he would spank it again with another pulse of electricity and he&#x27; keep doing this until the accumulated energy was so great that it would be uh a resource to be pulled back out of the sky uh by a proper antenna Tesla&#x27;s idea was to be able to provide power equally to all people on Earth at this time there are two to three billion people on this planet that can&#x27;t go home at night and turn on the lights we can the people that can are living in poverty Tesla saw that there was a division between The Have and Have Nots and he was determined to make electrical power equally available to all people on this planet as a gift t develops the technology at Colorado Springs to produce astonishingly high voltages and currents when the switch is thrown ghostly Sparks dance inside the lab while on the copper ball at top the antenna thick blue Lightning crackles upward over 100 ft into the sky thunderclaps are heard over 15 M away it is one of the great inventors crowning achievements man-made lightning the Colorado Springs he had a 56 uh kilovolt ampere Westinghouse Transformer that George Westinghouse gave to him and it had various Taps on it up to 55,000 volts and uh through the amplification of this transformer into his um magnifying transmitter is able to actually blowing up the Colorado Springs um some of the generators in the power Colorado Springs uh plant at a distance of about 25 Mi Away originally it was thought that he generated or used so much power from the uh utility company that uh burned out a couple of their generators since then there&#x27;s been some conjecture that actually he was picking up more energy from the surrounding air at that high altitude and it was feeding back into the generator and you cannot feed electrical energy back into a generator and that&#x27;s what blew him out and they wouldn&#x27;t sell him any more power until he and his assistant went down and repair the generators Tesla determines that waves of energy in the earth can be used to transmit power to any point on the globe in laboratory tests he successfully demonstrates the illumination of Wireless lamps many miles from the laboratory but his experiments also produce more ominous possibilities alpha waves in the human brain are between 6 and 8 Hertz the wave frequency of this human cavity resonates between 6 and 8 Hertz all biological systems operate in the same frequency range the human brain&#x27;s Alpha Waves function in this range and the electrical Resonance of the earth is between 6 and 8 Hertz thus our entire biological system the brain and the Earth itself work on the same frequency if we can control that resonance system electronically we could directly control the entire mental system of human kind Tesla aware of the awesome power this aspect of his Discovery might unleash decides to keep it under wraps with the success of the Colorado experiments Tesla moves back to New York City after courting several Financial backers he is introduced to JP Morgan the infamous banker and International here Morgan is convinced by Tesla&#x27;s promise that he can quote build a world broadcasting system that will earn Millions inspired by the earlier works of Genius attributed to Tesla the business savvy Morgan invests $150,000 though he must concede 51% ownership in His Radio patents to the fabulously wealthy industrialist Tesla nevertheless proceeds with his construction of the legendary Warden Cliff Tower in 1900 one and Cliff Laboratories were built by Tesla to try to prove his dream his radio transmission of power first it started off his told his back as it would be just voice communication but his real dream was power soon thereafter with Warden cliff in the midst of construction Tesla receives a report that guo Marone has successfully completed a Trans Ocean radio transmission Morgan threatens to pull out rather than admit defeat Tesla expands on his original idea for Warden Cliffe transforming it into the pilot project for his long envisioned Global power and communication system Tesla promises Morgan that he can erect a system of towers that will pull down energy from the ionosphere making it possible to transmit electricity throughout the world without wires in short free energy for everyone Tesla was called a nut because Tesla also said that he could generate without any fuel without any solar energy without any wind power he could generate electrical power and he did do that and and that was something that the fuel companies didn&#x27;t want to have happen he was also able to broadcast electrical power through the air without any wires and that project was stopped by JP Morgan when he when the commercial consequences became obvious seeing no way to make a profit from Tesla&#x27;s free energy device and convinced Marone would monopolize radio Morgan backs off ironically over 40 years later the Supreme Court of the United States determines that Marone copied His Radio technology from patents already held by Tesla and that it was Tesla who actually discovered Wireless transmission some believe that the warden Cliff Fiasco was about more than just money they say Tesla himself scuttled the plant out of fear that in the wrong hands the potential power generated by Warden Cliffe could bring lasting harm to the people and the [Music] planet although Morgan didn&#x27;t Finance the warden Cliff Tower at the end it seems to me the project was not stopped because of money Tesla stopped it when he realized his ideas might be co-opted and implemented solely for military purposes that&#x27;s probably the wisest decision a scientist can make and Tesla reveals for the first time in an article published in the in the New York Times that Warden Cliffe could also be used as a weapon to take down airplanes he managed to stop the catastrophe that would be attributed to him because being able to free and Target Down 2 billion volts from the ionosphere is sufficient to burn any City on the planet the effect is stronger than the atomic bomb did Tesla discover the ultimate means of Destruction the answer is still unresolved by 1915 it is rumored that Tesla and Thomas Edison are each to receive the Nobel Prize but these reports prove false 2 years later Tesla is awarded the Edison medal by the American Institute of electrical engineers but any credibility this might afford him is undone by Tesla&#x27;s extravagant boasts that Warden Cliffe can be used to modify the weather they tore the tower down during the war because uh the military thought that was there for a spy purposes took at least three or four charges of dynamite it was so wellb built they almost couldn&#x27;t demolish it but uh before it was uh completely dismembered uh it was experimented with by someone who wanted to project Scala waves all the birds seagulls and everything else left the area there wasn&#x27;t one within 20 mi and the fishermen normally go out there complain because there were no fish that they could catch within a radius of 10 or 15 mil or while that station was operating that&#x27;s why uh you can get a manifestation of uh some animals acting strangely a day or hours before an earthquake with his beloved Tower in Ruins Tesla Retreats into his laboratory and begins far more complex and dangerous [Music] experiments on July 11 1934 the New York Times reports that Nicola Tesla has developed a death ray a particle beam weapon that can destroy 10,000 planes at a distance of 250 Mi Tesla claims that a plan for producing this device could be constructed in 3 months at a cost of $2 million aside from the devastating offensive capabilities Tesla believes that if he can successfully Build 12 of these towers his is a weapon to end all wars Tesla&#x27;s uh famous death ray was a device which probably is very widely misunderstood and may have been one of the reasons why uh he didn&#x27;t receive some of the respect by the scientific community may have well deserved I think today a lot of people think of a death ray as a as a phaser or some esoteric type device you might see on a science fiction movie it&#x27;s a plan it&#x27;s [Music] [Applause] [Music] Superman Tesla&#x27;s claims terrify the public but Fascinate hollyood he is parody in Superman cartoons as a mad scientist terrorizing New York with an electro thasia Death Ray and an army of remote controlled robots take Tesla&#x27;s death rate was actually a particle beam weapon a particle beam weapon which he had developed in the 30s it was based on the principle of electrostatic acceleration of minute particles of charge similar to work being done by the Department of Defense the basic concept is that you take a particle a micro projectile it&#x27;s called and through the use of high voltage you accelerate it to to Great velocities the velocity being very high the particle doesn&#x27;t have to be very big to do a lot of damage damage if you get a stream of these things being accelerated and projected you&#x27;ll do substantial damage you&#x27;ll be able to knock down a missile in space for instance with only 12 such plants strategically placed around the United States Tesla claims his telforce can be used to keep the United States safe from all foes with the world on the verge of World War II the United States government takes an active interest in the Tesla death ray because was a patriot he offered this system to the United States government the United States government developed and worked and engineered this particle beam weapon beginning in the 40s we don&#x27;t know what the extent of the research was or where it went from there but we do have Declassified documents released under the frame of Information Act that demonstrate the US government&#x27;s extreme interest in Tesla&#x27;s particle beam weapon the New York Times states that Tesla&#x27;s death rate which can send concentrated beams of particles through the air and cause armies of millions to drop in their tracks is the most important of Tesla&#x27;s inventions but in an unprecedented decision Tesla makes the exploitation of his invention by any single government impossible he distributes the plans in proprietary segments like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle he gave it to the English Canadian American and Russian governments so that they had to sit down together to collaborate if they wanted to realize the whole invention he realized that people are not conscious enough to handle this information that&#x27;s why Tesla put these governments into mutual dependability there&#x27;s some evidence that Tesla had given the plans to the Russians who were on our side at that time in the 1970s Aviation week showed a an article on the Russian particle beam weapon and Tesla&#x27;s particle beam weapon didn&#x27;t surface till about 10 years later when Andrea poar brought it out and the schematics exactly matched the Russian particle beam weapon head of US Air Force intelligence Major General George Keegan describes the Soviet system and what comes out of the end of this little magnetic tube are pulsed proton beams 100 billion electron volts each at energy levels at 10 to the 10 Jews that&#x27;s just simp simply more energy than any man has ever conceived of in the United States and then you have to bend that beam and you have to burn it through the atmosphere and you have to find an object to aim it at Nicola Tesla sent a proposal to Russian scientists and Engineers on May 16th 1935 concerning high voltage and the acceleration of charged particles he received a list of follow-up questions from them in November of that year military Scholars contend that the Soviets achieved a 100% Star Wars defense by 1968 we had learned through very sensitive sources that the Soviets in 1977 would test in Space the most powerful laser in history 10 times more powerful than any laser we have under development in the US finally when I became chief of Air Force intelligence My First Act of office was to put out an order stating that this device and this development would be the number one priority in Air Force intelligence so we set up a meeting with 40 or 50 of the top nuclear scientists in the Free World from Edward Teller on down and these scientists for 6 years under a $60 million secret project called project seesaw had been trying to develop an electron beam to shoot down icbms and they&#x27; failed and now now both in the White House and in the Department of Defense there is an embarrassed silence as the technicians and scientists on both steps now having examined the massive body of research we did in the Air Force suddenly realize that they may have misinformed the American public was President Ronald Reagan merely attempting to catch up with the Soviets in his development of the Strategic Defense Initiative all we can do is make sure the technology becomes the Ally and protector of piece that we build better Shields rather than sharper and more deadly swords in so doing maybe we can help to bring an end to the brutal Legacy of Modern Warfare as a result of America&#x27;s delays in Weaponry development Tesla&#x27;s discoveries are only now nearly 100 years later being adapted for both offensive and defensive purposes the latest development space-based particle beam satellites the paper which showed the the technology to make the anti-war machine was eventually published in the proceedings of the uh International Tesla Society so it is it&#x27;s in a public domain now how to do it and and what is uncanny is that when one knows today&#x27;s Star Wars program and and the the beam weapon that has been selected it is almost identical to what was proposed by Tesla at the time that I came across the documents I took it to experts in the Aerospace field and asked them to look at his technique for generating high voltages at the time the Aerospace firm I was working with was working on particle beam technology and they had a a study group that was working on proposals to give to the government on um directed energy weapons I gave that proposal to the advanced projects research team and asked them to consider it the only word that I ever got back from them was that they said it was interesting and they would say no more Tesla certainly spoke of a very large series of very powerful weapons I think that&#x27;s a reasonable thing and let&#x27;s approach it this way certainly I&#x27;m on record as saying the weapons exist and that several Nations have weaponized them we know that the Russians very early on were interested in things like free energy right out of the vacuum and they were interested in weapons what became a Tesla&#x27;s weapon it&#x27;s never been heard from since it may be something that&#x27;s in a closet somewhere it may be something that&#x27;s used it may be in orbit we don&#x27;t know there is no question today that the Soviet Union has these weapons and if what I put together is correct and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced it is three other nations of the world also develop those weapons and resoundingly checked the Soviet Union the other three are friendly to the United States not hostile and I think that played one great part in the fall of the Soviet Empire three other nations today are indeed working on what I call the Tesla weapons or really scalar electromagnetic weapons and these nations are not really friendly to the US at all so it&#x27;s a much more dangerous world that has emerged in an article published November 3rd 1998 bill girz of the Washington Times writes the Chinese Army is building laser weapons and already possesses particle beam weapons capable of damaging sensors on space-based reconnaissance and intelligence systems if the people&#x27;s Liberation Army has beam weapons what about the US military under promise of anonymity this Navy SEAL spoke about current capabilities we do have particle beam weapons I&#x27;ve used them we did underwater tests off the coast of California the capabilities are awesome you can knock down a satellite a ship a plane anything in the global race for new technology it appears that Tesla&#x27;s death beam is not the only secret invention that supposedly disappears when he dies on July 4th 1976 the celebration of America&#x27;s Bicentennial a strange new signal is monitored on ham radio frequencies this high-pitched chattering is dubbed the Woodpecker signal by the Central Intelligence Agency they have no idea what it is but they are able to triangulate its source to a Soviet transmitter in lvia the Soviets had experimented with creating artificial Aurora not sure what the objective was but uh I think it was probably uh designed to prove prove that you could uh project very low frequency energy Over the Horizon over great distances and cause certain effects you can induce virtually any effect that a chemical can cause in a living system with a um an external primarily extremely low frequency magnetic field my personal feeling is that primarily I think it was designed to communicate with their submarines on July 13th 19 1977 at 9:119 p.m. the Woodpecker signal abruptly stops a strange Corona forms around Edison electric power generators servicing New York City and the entire city is suddenly plunged Into Darkness creating chaos and confusion the blackout is similar in its effects to Tesla&#x27;s Colorado Springs experiment that overloads and sets Ablaze the local electrical power plant uh you know things start to Brown out the this uh uh we started seeing very strange things happen to New Yorkers who went berserk uh it was literally absolutely dangerous to be there in New York City and was a headache for police and and who knows all the security people around was it Tesla&#x27;s secret that electricity could alter the mental state of human beings if so was that secret delivered into the wrong hands and who is responsible for the test Tesla inspired program known as harp a government project some experts believe is the first stage of an entirely new phase in weapons [Music] technology war or peace which does science serve best Tesla described himself not as an inventor but as a Discoverer but with Discovery comes responsibility Tesla knew this when he developed harp technology and many think that his fear of what mighten happen if harp fell into the wrong hands motivated him to keep his Discovery under WS harp exists because Tesla theorized back in the 30s that he would be able to stimulate the magnetic field of the Earth in such a way that he would actually be able to create a shield around the city harp is um basically a design experiment in terms of atmospheric physics where a large array of antennas it&#x27;s not just one in in it&#x27;s a very large array it covers several Acres um are broadcasting into the ionosphere of the planet a very very complex series of waveforms and these waveforms are designed to specifically couple in with the ionosphere which is a resonant cavity this concept involves heating up the ionosphere in a manner similar to a giant microwave oven that a small input like a pulse of a certain number of watts in can create create a large output because whether accidentally or intentionally it&#x27;s possible to tap into this sea of energy around us it surrounds us and goes through our bodies and is everywhere throughout space Harp&#x27;s original designer conceives it as a shield for missile defense that can fry the circuitry of incoming bombs harp was designed to uh for a number of applications it really was not set up as a weapon if you read the patents I was thinking of ways to use it defensively he also claims that by superheating portions of the upper atmosphere harp can affect global weather patterns a concept Tesla was ridiculed for nearly a century earlier one of the real dangers of harp is that we have con we concentrate with harp in one very small area of the ionosphere we create a lightning rod effect we create a lightning rod that can distort the magnetosphere of the planet which is the magnetic Shield of the planet not only are you sending energy into the ionosphere but you&#x27;re providing a path for energy to come back down out of the ionosphere the electrons and energy will come from all over the ionosphere to that one point and it will strike the ground in a bolt that is 100 times greater than any lightning bolt imaginable kind of like three or four Mount St Helen volcanoes going off each second [Music] the true power of harp technology is not yet known and there is no civilian monitoring agency the possibility that harp may be capable of enormous planetary disruptions including weather changes global warming or even slowing the Earth&#x27;s orbit by Shifting the shape of the ionosphere may tell us why Tesla suppressed the blueprints for this invention he stopped his poers shield defense project in 1905 because he realized that such a resonant system of five towers around the globe could cause a tremendous destruction of [Music] humankind not long after Tesla&#x27;s money runs out his main supporters either die or sever relations as his anonymity increases he continues with even more esoteric research he was very much concerned with being able to utilize the phenomenon of resonance to do certain things not the least of which was to destroy certain materials and that was evidence later on by that uh experiment he did on Wall Street where uh a new building steel building was going up and uh he tried out one of his uh resonators nothing more than a mechanical vibrator it was battery operator and set up a a resonance in the steel beams to the point where it kept building up like pushing a kid on a swing you know keep pushing and little push will take it a lot further every time and he almost brought the building down scared the people who were working on it they thought they were having an earthquake and they went down and called the police and everything else Tesla got a little bit scared and picked up his equipment put in his pocket and went home he had one other unfortunate incident which today would would laugh at but was very serious at the time he picked up radio signals from space you know we know today of course that planets radiate uh RF noise and so forth but when he announced this it was uh it just caused a sensation and all the scientists said immediately what a c you know what a idiot there were rumors you went to Colorado Springs in order to contact Mars is that true I never never intended to however I recorded certain electrical impulses of Unknown Origin and these were repeated at constantly timed intervals it&#x27;s possible they were a kind of signal from space and did you in turn send them a message ask the Martians that question no more questions they got to thinking I&#x27;m sure well he&#x27;s talking crazy now he&#x27;s feeding pigeons in the park and he&#x27;s got this crazy idea of transmitting signals to Mars and Tesla is so advanced in his thinking so sensitive and eccentric that few of his colleagues understand his work he has perceived as snobbish and overconfident he was ostracized I think primarily because of his difference and because of his radical statements and because of his pronouncements of great systems they didn&#x27;t have the foggiest notion of what he was talking about Nicola Tesla saw many of his inventions scrutinized then adopted by the military however it becomes apparent that as a citizen of the planet Tesla ultimately serves a much higher authority he met Swami Viva Cananda in New York City in the late 1890s Swami Viva Cananda was probably the first Yogi to come to this country with Eastern philosophy and present it to the West it was at Swami Viva cana&#x27;s lectures that Tesla picked up the Sanskrit terminology Prana aasha and the concepts of The Ether that led him to determine or actually led him to a point where he could describe succinctly the physics of the universe the physics of matter Creation in this dimension in many of his letters he wrote that if he were to choose a religion it would be Buddhism all his stories about his journeys in other worlds about dreams about machines that operated in his imagination were manifestations similar to the experience of the shamans it was known that his Solutions came during a dream Tesla&#x27;s view of the universe his cosmology if I might call it that is based on viewing life from a spiritual point of view and it was in the science of the ancient works of the vadas where he found the spiritual terminology to describe what he saw manifest in the physical world what leads Tesla to this spiritual awakening may never be known but it is not uncommon among those Forward Thinking patrons of Discovery people like Robert Oppenheimer father of the nuclear bomb or Albert Einstein that in the end they recognize the singular Perfection of the interconnected and life IMB system of our planet he was trying to understand what the basics of energy and resonance were what is the nature of the energy that&#x27;s in the cosmos what&#x27;s the what&#x27;s the basic essence of the energies that come through nothingness to give us something I think those were the questions that the T Tesla was intrigued with when Tesla dies at the age of 87 his legacy of over 700 important patents slip Into Obscurity forgotten by nearly everyone except the US government Tesla&#x27;s possessions are sequestered in a government warehouse for 10 years following his death official reports confirm that the collection was microfilm during this period when contacted however no government agency revealed any information regarding these microfilms after a decade the government officially denies the existence of any secret weapons Technologies included among the Tesla papers rumors nevertheless persist to this day whatever may have befallen Tesla&#x27;s undeveloped discoveries the inventions that remain contribute daily to our science our medicine and our environment perhaps this is what Tesla ultimately envisioned perhaps the missing secrets of Nicola Tesla are right where they belong [Music] Tesla disagreed with Scientists about some basic concepts of Relativity Theory and quantum mechanical Theory and he fell out of favor with the established scientists of the day Tesla was very knowledgeable about quantum mechanics and Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity both were developed during his lifetime and he suspected that sooner or later quantum mechanics and relativity theorists would enter into a CR and that&#x27;s why he used to say the present time is theirs but the future is mine Sir Robert Einstein also said that once there&#x27;s a bunch of little theories all over the world there a Prelude to a major breakthrough in science and physics I think that science today needs to take a new look at some of the theories of Tesla because there is more to the universe than what we are looking at and what we&#x27;re observing with our scientific instruments we&#x27;ve reached a point in our conscious evolution of the species we have the ability at our fingertips now to engineer and to manipulate SpaceTime and gravity we&#x27;re on the threshold of a new technology Nicola Tesla was the gatekeeper of lightning some of his ideas earned him a reputation as a fruit cake as some permanently rocked the world of science still others changed our planet and our lives the next time you plug in your cable
