            <p>this would literally end all pollution on Earth but it would also end poverty on the planet within about 20 years this is a big announcement I hope this goes viral because that&#x27;s what we need their plan is to create a threat from outer space to try to unite the world like Independence Day the movie in a sort of a military Global P of humans against aliens back in the 70s they could hit a button basically and Stage an alien attack on the planet what do you think about Elon Musk and what is he like a niika Tesla is he a good guy in your eyes if he was inclined to research this end of it he wouldn&#x27;t be making a I call it a fake Tesla I mean a real Tesla car wouldn&#x27;t have to be plugged in that existed in 1920s Nicolet Tesla had one these folks the world is always sure they operate as they want who nominates them nobody it&#x27;s so sensitive we&#x27;re not going to let the president control this anymore or the Congress the big corporate media Left Right Center all of it is corrupt you&#x27;re convinced all of it is corrupt absolutely corrupt and the proof of it is so a couple months ago I watch this documentary called The Lost entry Blown Away by first time I heard about invention secrecy Act of 1951 I told my wife baby you got to watch it then I told my son you got to watch it I told everybody you got to watch this documentary 6,000 patents that were protected by the senator called John Sparkman it went into effect in 1952 somehow someway that year they chose to nominate him on the Democratic party as the vice president November 1st we test the biggest nuclear test at the time that was 700 times more powerful than the one we dropped in Hiroshima November 5th was election and then Steven gury I said hey man I know we did a podcast four years ago we got to do another one because I got a whole different thing I want to talk to you about he came on we had a two and a half hour conversation together he told me about the fact that the government has access to technology to teleport you know teleportation we hear about in movies and sci-fi and all this stuff says n they&#x27;ve had access to it for a while told the time about an encounter that George HW Bush Senor had with President Bill Clinton telling him what to stop talking about and not even look into private conversation he had with Barry Goldwater lots of weird things colleagues that were killed for having information and then today he released is this project he&#x27;s been working on for many many years well you&#x27;ll have access to all these information from the invention secrecy Act of 1951 anyways I don&#x27;t want to take anything away from this um you will be fascinated by this conversation especially if you are a capitalist if you have a family and you want to find a way to preserve this great you know World we&#x27;re living in right Earth and you wanted to be around and you want to find out who are the Power Players that are controlling all the good things that could potentially happen to you and I for the future you&#x27;re going to want to watch this thing in its entirety so the last time we were together you and I was May of 2020 which is a little over four years ago four years in a month Y and it was a fascinating conversation millions of people watched it it was great we talked about aliens we talked about your encounters with aliens experiences what you&#x27;ve done obviously a doctor scientist the things you&#x27;ve worked on uh I I even think your dad was he working on the certain responsibilities with the atomic for for the government what what what was your dad&#x27;s uh no it was my uncle helped design the lunar module the lunar that&#x27;s right on the moon the first time with Armstrong so this is like this is in your jeans you&#x27;ve been interested in this for a while and then recently I was late to this two months ago I I watched uh uh the law Century right and how to reclaim it a documentary that he did that I think came out in 2023 if I&#x27;m not mistaken right it came out last year I watched it and then I was blown away by The Invention secrecy act and I went down a rabbit hole and I wanted to find out who wrote this bill and what happened to the guy that wrote the Bill the guy that wrote the Bill you know who he is the John sparksman I think his name is or something like that you know he ends up uh becoming the vice the nominee for the Democratic vice presidential candidate of 1952 exactly the year they wrote the Bill and they&#x27;re holding on to 6,000 patents and then I had my wife watch it then I had my son watch it he&#x27;s here right now he just met you a few minutes ago and I think the world needs to know about this right and that&#x27;s when I said I think we need to do part two and I&#x27;m glad you said yes happy to be here you do a great show so so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s start off with that I mean I got a lot of things I want to go through with you but I want to start off with that to the average person when I ask them have you heard of invention secrecy act when I tell you 99% say I&#x27;ve never heard of it I&#x27;m being friendly because 100% people are like what is the invention secrecy Act of 1951 can you tell the audience what is the invention secrecy Act of 1951 who was behind it and why well it actually became an offshoot of the projects from the 40s uh dealing with energy and technology and propulsion systems that if they were disclosed would be the immediate replacement of oil gas coal surface Transportation Public Utilities well in today&#x27;s dollars you&#x27;re talking probably over a th000 trillion dollars so uh what most people don&#x27;t realize is that around between 1945 and 1954 was the Heyday of electromagnetic engineering dealing with energy and propulsion and it was from two sources uh research that had been done in the late 1800s and early 20th century and even things that people call anti-gravity not the correct scientific term but let&#x27;s just go with that it&#x27;s really gravity control um those experiments started in the late 20s with t Townson Brown and the Koski Frost experiment in Germany and were very high voltage systems would cause objects to lift and basically have mass cancellation and look like they&#x27;re define gravity and levitate this the G engines you&#x27;re talking about yep and th but that was earlier I mean that was later this was 20s but those began to be more and more classified so T towns and Browns work became some of the core founding for What&#x27;s called the ran Corporation in Ventura California but those got populated with the research from retrieving extraterrestrial vehicles in the for mid 40s and 50s where they began to study them under a very highly classified project I have the documents we&#x27;ve just released all of them to the public last month in our disclosure project intelligence archive but it describes in in one of the Canadian top secret documents that a top secret team was working on this in 1950 and the work they were doing surpassed the secrecy of the development of the hydrogen bomb the ultimate doomsday weapon if you can imagine now this is an authenticated top secret you know document so the the punchline of that is there was this technological breakthroughs both human and then studying objects from outer space let&#x27;s say that came together the like two Mighty rivers that became this torrent but very classified so they realized that there were too many people stumbling across this and they created this act to be give the government the power that even if you don&#x27;t apply for a patent if they learn you have something that they want to seize all they have to do is issue a national security order on it they take it and this is not a conspiracy theory and all that it&#x27;s is just a fact you can look up the you know people can look this up um and I am working I&#x27;ve worked over the years with many many people who&#x27;ve had that happen to them a genius that have had their work confiscated um and it would be an enormous benefit to humanity</p>
