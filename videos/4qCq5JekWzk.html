            <p>my name is david lee payne and i&#x27;m rj simonini and we are t3 eleventronics this is our project em gravity shield sir isaac newton stated that gravity affects all objects equally because force equals mass times acceleration gravity is directly proportional to an object&#x27;s mass this theory is actually incorrect because by using high frequency high voltage electromagnetic fields it&#x27;s possible to disrupt the local gravity field around an object making its mass irrelevant we can lift different masses with the same amount of voltage using an outlet of 120 volts at 15 amps we hooked it up to our 12 volt 4 amp power supply next we used a pair of alligator clip leads to supply power to our custom build power supply as you can see several main components are used such as resistors diodes and ic chips our power supply we build has an output of one thousand volts which is then fed into the cockwell walton multiplier conquest generator uses 10 capacitors and diodes soldered in series in parallel to generate an output of 20 000 volts at one milliamp we then attach the positive lead to the 30 gauge wire on the craft and a negative lead to the foil skirt or fuselage which then creates a physical anomaly of anti-gravity propulsion the noise you are hearing is the fuselage of the craft vibrating at a very high frequency which is also emitting electrons as known as ionization here rj is taking data from a similar four-inch craft on behalf of t3 levitronics we would like to thank the electronics and physics department of our local high school all parents and especially dominic marone our aerospace consultant for his many lectures on electric gravity propulsion we look forward to moving on to the next stage of the competition you</p>
