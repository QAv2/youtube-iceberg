<p>And rounding it all up, we&#x27;ve got Woodro Smith. Good to see everybody. Welcome to Disclosure Tonight. Let&#x27;s jump into the studio if we can. Mike, Mike, Mike, how the hell are you? &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re muted.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m doing uh well today, Thomas. We&#x27;re going to have a hell of a show, I think, as a followup to our show yesterday. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the follow up to our show on Thursday and everything. Yeah, things are kind of cranking here at Disclosure Tonight a little bit with the rejuvenated interest and bringing out the truth about the non-human intelligence.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s been dying for a while like uh an apple on the tree that&#x27;s been left over slowly rotting away. But you know what? We&#x27;ve got some energy. There&#x27;s more things going. But the biggest thing after talking with Nick and others last night, temper your expectation, folks, because you know it&#x27;s not going to be as much as you expect. It&#x27;s not going to be as quick as you expect.</p>
<p>You know, this is what we tell all of our audience members when a lot of stuff happens. Stay in the middle. Be hopeful. Don&#x27;t go ahead and get overly excited like, &quot;Oh my god, we&#x27;re getting everything.&quot; No, we&#x27;re not going to get everything. We&#x27;re not going to get things that could potentially jap jeopardize national security.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not going to hear about the latest weapons that they&#x27;re building based on this stuff. If anything, Mike, we&#x27;re going to get an acknowledgement, if you want to call softer disclosure versus, hey, we&#x27;re going to bring everything out. But this could open up the opportunity to go ahead and bring more people in the science field into this to try and figure out what&#x27;s going on. Hey, Mike. &gt;&gt; And more witnesses that I think will come forward at that point.</p>
<p>Oh, &gt;&gt; they&#x27;ll have a lot to say and they&#x27;ll probably feel now this would be the time to say it. &gt;&gt; Imagine if we can imagine if we can get Eric Davis &gt;&gt; and James Latsky unccorked approved by the president to go ahead and talk about at least some of the stuff they&#x27;ve been working on. That would be amazing. &gt;&gt; It would be. You could add Jay Stratton to the mix as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He was part of the head of the UAPF. Let&#x27;s completely unccor Lou Alzando and even David Grush. There&#x27;s a lot of people who have come forward who could say so much more, but they&#x27;ve been shackled by the non-disclosures they executed when they were part of the federal government. That stuff lasts a lifetime.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It does. But yeah, I can I can imagine if they took the leash off David Grush, he&#x27;d have a lot to say. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That and then some.</p>
<p>On that note, um let&#x27;s start off let&#x27;s start off today&#x27;s show. We&#x27;ve got a uh uh 6 and 1/2 minute 6 hours 6 minutes 45 seconds uh video of Lou Alzando. That&#x27;s why he was so busy last night, Mike over on uh News Nation. &gt;&gt; So, let&#x27;s go ahead and play this for the audience and we&#x27;ll follow up. We&#x27;ve got other stuff, a bunch of other stuff to get to.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s get to this first one for audience and uh let me get this just a little bit and uh rock and roll. Here we go, folks. Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave class the right information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that.</p>
<p>I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; We know illegal. &gt;&gt; First of all, here&#x27;s my point. Why didn&#x27;t it happen already? Okay. Uh Trump then posted, &quot;Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War and other relevant government agencies, departments to begin the process of identifying and releasing government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, uh unidentified aerial phenomena, and unidentified flying objects.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s bring in the former director of the Pentagon&#x27;s advanced aerospace threat identification program, Lou Alzando.&quot; Lou, good to see you, brother. &gt;&gt; Always good to see you. Thanks for having me, Chris. Now, I know I&#x27;m supposed to say great because we&#x27;re going to get more transparency. Why didn&#x27;t they do this already? &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s a great question.</p>
<p>First of all, it&#x27;s a bit of a Pandora&#x27;s box. Uh we have known as a nation for for over 80 dec 80 years, eight decades, that there are things flying in our controlled US airspace, frankly, that um we don&#x27;t know what they are. Now, let me caveat this for a moment. Everything technically is a UAP or a UFO until it becomes identified, right? We call these TNO, temporary nonattributable objects. Just like we saw with the Chinese spy balloon, we see with drone incursions uh quite routinely.</p>
<p>Until you can identify what something is, it is of course always going to be unidentified. The problem is is that we&#x27;ve also been dealing with some fairly sophisticated advanced technologies that does not appear superficially anyways to be our own technology and and probably not foreign adversarial technology. So then the real question uh has to be asked. Okay, if it&#x27;s not ours and it&#x27;s not theirs then then whose is it and what are we doing about it? And I think that&#x27;s a much more difficult conversation uh to have and certainly if if the president is serious about this which by the way I applaud for any president to take charge of this this this topic. Um now the real hard work begins.</p>
<p>This is not people think oh we we finally made it. We&#x27;re there. We&#x27;re getting truth and transparency. No, you just had a declaration that truth and transparency is going to be pursued. Um, but there&#x27;s a huge huge process, monumental process that has to be undertaken.</p>
<p>And if you think the Epstein files right now uh are are kind of a kind of a hard a hard topic and and subject to try to to break free into the public sphere, you ain&#x27;t seen nothing yet. Um, this topic has a potential to eclipse that of of the Epstein file simply because the government has been sitting on this information for so long. There&#x27;s so much documentation now within our own holdings, within the intelligence community, within the defense communities, within Department of Energy, um that this is a &gt;&gt; Hold on a second there, Mike. He mentioned the Department of Energy. That is the hidden place where all this all the good stuff is kept &gt;&gt; for the past eight decades, the way Lou said it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it&#x27;s good to see something we&#x27;ve been bringing up, God, since the show&#x27;s been around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at.</p>
<p>Oh, god. Yeah. All right, let&#x27;s continue. &gt;&gt; This is going to be a tremendous undertaking. &gt;&gt; Look, it&#x27;s not new.</p>
<p>One of my favorite bands is called the Foo Fighters, and that&#x27;s from uh World War II time, nighttime pilots had unidentified things that everybody different ones kept seeing. And they called them foo fighters based on some cartoon at the time. So, it&#x27;s not new. And we just dealt with it, Lou, in a very different context than the if it&#x27;s not ours and it&#x27;s not theirs, who&#x27;s it? They shut that airspace down over El Paso. And you and I know why.</p>
<p>The cartels have drone technology. They&#x27;ve been working with China and they are able to do things that we don&#x27;t know how to counter. And it spooked us. And that&#x27;s how that&#x27;s what I want to know about is what are we doing about this? And why won&#x27;t you tell us? &gt;&gt; But I still go back to the original suspicion though, Lou. &gt;&gt; Biden didn&#x27;t do this.</p>
<p>Trump came in and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll do it.&quot; And you and I were all excited. Trump then comes in and they don&#x27;t do it and now you think because he just said that he&#x27;s going to do it that something&#x27;s going to change. Why should I believe it? &gt;&gt; Well, I I think uh you know actions speak louder than words. I think if we start to see for example uh a bureaucracy that&#x27;s beginning to align in this direction, for example, the establishment of an executive order from President Trump that says clearly and definitively you will uh by law declassify XYZ. uh and if you start seeing for example uh a national intelligence estimate that is now being sponsored by uh the director of national intelligence perhaps and even perhaps some sections in the new national intelligence strategy that specifically start talking about uh the topic of UAP then I think we can both agree that yeah there&#x27;s there&#x27;s some real meaningful work being done behind behind this and I I do believe I do believe there&#x27;s interest by members of the administration uh I will say that that there are individuals currently right now in the administration that are very keen and trying to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>There are if you have private talks with people in Congress, a lot of these people will tell you themselves that they have witnessed extraordinary things that they cannot explain. Now, let me caveat that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that each one of those is a UAP. But when you start to put the information together, me as a former investigator, uh when you start putting this this these data points together, you begin to realize you start seeing a pattern. And that&#x27;s really where where the value comes in all this. when you can when can you get a clear a clear picture of what you&#x27;re seeing and you can then make the determination again that it is not ours and not foreign adversarial.</p>
<p>Now you bring up a great point, Chris, about drones. We saw with the New Jersey drone flap, right, the same issue. And by the way, in Colorado in 2019 and Nebraska, uh we had a similar event occur over the course of several weeks where law enforcement was involved and at no time were we able to get or identify or retrieve a single drone, not one drone. And if you talk to the law enforcement, they&#x27;ll tell you a lot of these things we&#x27;re not behaving like drones at all. And so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s that&#x27;s what concerns me.</p>
<p>If we have something in our skies, &gt;&gt; listen, I&#x27;m with you. &gt;&gt; You know, we don&#x27;t know what it is and there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it. That&#x27;s a national security. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. I mean, look, what&#x27;s the explanation that the administration came out and gave us about what happened in El Paso? &gt;&gt; None.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t [laughter] none. We just got distracted by Nancy Guthrie and other things. And people get fatigued. They don&#x27;t want to talk about it anymore because they heard about it already. the president is trying to make a clever pivot right here because there&#x27;s some things he doesn&#x27;t want us talking about as much anymore either and I understand that.</p>
<p>Hopefully uh we get some real transparency because I&#x27;m with you Lou. I&#x27;m on team Alzando on this and I&#x27;m pushing for transparency and you&#x27;re always welcome to do it here. &gt;&gt; I app be well and thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Take care. God bless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There we go. Great message coming from Lu Alzando. Uh salute at the end, Mike. Interesting conversation to say the absolute least. Um, it&#x27;s great to go ahead and see Lou talk about this scenario.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s your take on what he had to say? &gt;&gt; I think he was laying it out very clearly for Chris Cuomo about doing a national intelligence assessment on what it is that the government has been uh hiding in its coffers the whole time. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a step in the right direction. And if we get the executive order out of Trump, which he hasn&#x27;t issued it yet, &gt;&gt; but if he does, then I think that&#x27;s a step in the right direction and we&#x27;ll start to see some things come forward. &gt;&gt; Yeah, great points. Now, interesting point coming from uh Cuomo was that blaming that Trump used this as the wild card to distract from Epstein.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Epstein. Yeah, that sounds like a good It sounds like a good poll. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let&#x27;s do that. &gt;&gt; But honestly, it feels more like it was a coordinated effort. We&#x27;ll do that.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll do that as a second survey. Did Trump Oh god. Uh distract from &gt;&gt; Epstein. Epstein epst ein n start the poll. Let&#x27;s see where our audience goes on this one.</p>
<p>Okay, audience, you&#x27;ve got Hey, hey, Google, set a timer from 1 minute and 30 seconds, please. &gt;&gt; Okay, Google, set a timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; Sure. 1 minute and 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; It should know my voice by now.</p>
<p>[laughter] &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s see where the audience is saying this so far. All right, we&#x27;ve got a 60/40 split mic. Let&#x27;s see how long this goes in a minute 20 if we can. Let&#x27;s go ahead and start that that music we have in the background. Usually when this kind of thing is going on, uh Darl, how would you say on this? Would you say that uh Trump started this to distract? Yes.</p>
<p>No. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. I wouldn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t say that at all.</p>
<p>And for the reason why uh Mike and I were talking we were talking about this yesterday, the connecting the dots. We&#x27;re all talking about connecting the dots. You know, Ducy asked the question of Biden, you know, what do you think about Obama saying UAP is real? Blah blah blah. You know, he trots off with the earpiece in his ear. Ducy&#x27;s the guy that asked the question on Air Force One that sparked all this.</p>
<p>But, so that&#x27;s interesting. But more interesting to me is we were all laughing about Lara Trump last weekend looking like she had a couple glasses of wine talking about a speech that may have been written. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Um by the president about aliens. Then coincidentally, Obama says aliens are real in the same week.</p>
<p>And then in the same week, Trump says you got to release everything. Um Department of &gt;&gt; 10 seconds left. Audience, get your votes in. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s too many too many too many dots being connected there. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>All right, with just 3 seconds left, 1 second left. Let me go ahead and take a screenshot of this for posterity for audience. We end it off with a let&#x27;s call it a 60/40 split. Uh close enough. I guess the next question we could say is if I got one more survey I want to do a lightning round here.</p>
<p>Our next one is start a poll. The next question is, was Trump&#x27;s statement a hand off of a planned plan disclosure? Meaning, was Trump&#x27;s state was Obama&#x27;s statement followed by what Trump did to follow up. Was that planned? Was it something that was orchestrated behind the scenes to make a planned disclosure? Let&#x27;s see where audience goes on this one. Hey Google, set a timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds, please. Hey Google, set a timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, 1 minute and 30 seconds starting now. &gt;&gt; I swear this fucking device is like a kid now. It doesn&#x27;t want to listen. Oh, that&#x27;s right. Cuz I have to go in the Google Home app to go ahead enable Gemini and all that wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see where our audience goes on this one. Well, look at this. It&#x27;s opposite. Not even uh 60% of our audience this time, Darl, is saying that yes, this is a planned disclosure. It was a planned movement between Obama and Trump to open Pandora&#x27;s box.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, if you Yeah, it&#x27;s all conjecture, but it&#x27;s just like so many things. I I mean, it&#x27;s three things, you know, that just kind of all aligned in a week. That&#x27;s just kind of ironic. And I saw Craig had mentioned in the chat that uh that Laura Trump blocked that statement or that whatever back today, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.</p>
<p>Obama did the same thing. It had the same the same production of, you know, letting go of all the the alien. &gt;&gt; You said too much, Lara. Take it back. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>She was the head of the Republican committee. I mean, she&#x27;s not stupid. And you know, Yeah. I I think she was trying to look a little silly on that show to be honest with you. I I because I I have seen her talk quite a bit and it was almost kind of giddy just like good old Caroline Lev behind the president.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Giddy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Giddy. &gt;&gt; Glowing for that for that fact.</p>
<p>All right. Well, just &gt;&gt; you sure she didn&#x27;t get a You sure she didn&#x27;t get like a spanking from Trump or you know somebody told her something like &gt;&gt; Yeah. Her husband [laughter] Don Jr. &gt;&gt; She&#x27;s definitely into older guys, that&#x27;s for sure. It&#x27;s a That&#x27;s a good thing for me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. All right, let&#x27;s go ahead. We&#x27;ve got a screenshot. Let&#x27;s go ahead and shut down. It&#x27;s a 60, you know, there we go.</p>
<p>We got two We have two surveys in a row. One saying, will Trump&#x27;s uh state was Trump&#x27;s statement of hand uh wait, was Trump&#x27;s statement a handoff of planned disclosure 60/40 split on this one? And the other one we had up earlier, did Trump start UFO disclosure to distract from Epstein? You know, we&#x27;re at a 60/40 split, it seems, on a lot of our videos, on a lot of our uh surveys today. &gt;&gt; Close with the audience. &gt;&gt; 6040 is pretty close to 50/50. So, yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. But there&#x27;s still that 10% lead over the other, which means there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a measurable difference between 50/50. It&#x27;s not like 54, you know, 5448. It&#x27;s 6040 close to it. &gt;&gt; Maybe you should always have uh three questions in there just to see if you can see how it splits up even more finitely.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, we we can try that. We can try that. You know, we need what we need to do is we need to do a test live stream where we can get this going and we can figure it out. And if the audience sees that we&#x27;re doing a test live stream to figure out uh uh surveys, jump in and be a participant on that one. It&#x27;ll be something that&#x27;ll be up for a short period of time.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll figure it out and then we&#x27;ll get it going on our next video. We&#x27;ve got here got a bunch of videos today&#x27;s folks. We&#x27;ve got stuff coming from Annapina Luna. Uh Timber. We&#x27;ve got an audio clip coming from uh oh god uh Berles even kind of going trying to take back uh what happened at Roswell.</p>
<p>My god, he is talking too much to stinking Greer. My god. Let&#x27;s go ahead and get this next clip up of uh Marin von Renamp who&#x27;s involved with the Soul Foundation and he&#x27;s been involved in uh national security issues for a long time. Let&#x27;s go ahead and get this clip up and going. Here we go, folks.</p>
<p>[music] &gt;&gt; Are we finally on the eve of a true age of disclosure when all government secrets about alleged alien life and UFOs will finally finally be revealed? Perhaps after President Trump gave the green light for government files on extraterrestrial life to be released to the public. It is [clears throat] a direction that a growing number of voices have been calling for for years. From UFO whistleblowers to top ranking congressional officials. Here at NewsNation, we haven&#x27;t just been following the story, we&#x27;ve been leading it. Two years ago, we brought you the eyeopening story of David Grush, the former Air Force intelligence officer who became a whistleblower and alleged government cover up of a UFO retrieval program.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I never wanted to do this, but my sense of service, you know, I decided to do this for the for the right reasons, I think, to um hold Congress accountable, hold the IG accountable, and the executive branch accountable because we have a severe constitutional crisis right now. This is a This is not a laughing matter. &gt;&gt; Now, that call for accountability could soon be answered. Trump posted on Truth Social that due to quote, &quot;Tremendous interest, he is directing government agencies to begin identifying and releasing files related to extraterrestrial life, UAPs, and UFOs.&quot; Trump has been dancing around the disclosure topic for years, so this announcement might not be too surprising. coming as it did just hours after former President Barack Obama made headlines on the subject.</p>
<p>He said on a podcast he thought aliens were real. The comment lit up social media and yesterday reporters asked President Trump to weigh in. &gt;&gt; Barack Obama said that aliens are real. Have you seen any evidence of nonhuman visitors to Earth? &gt;&gt; Well, he gave classified information. He&#x27;s not supposed to be doing that.</p>
<p>I may get him out of trouble by declassifying. &gt;&gt; You know, I have to say the statements that Trump has made has gotten more coverage than any other statement from left to right, from up to down, you name it. It&#x27;s been covered around the world. So, uh, it just shows how much interest there is out there depending on irrespective of what party that you&#x27;re a part of to bring out the truth. Here we go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And with that, he ordered the files to be declassified and released. perhaps wanting to create a little viral sensation of his own. But when we when might we see any of them? There&#x27;s no word on that and no word on what those files might contained. And please remember the relative nothing ber of the JFK files released last year. &gt;&gt; So how big really is this? We&#x27;re joined now by Mark von Renenf who served at the departments of state and defense.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s also a contributor at the Hill. So Mark, you say this is a huge development, but we should be cautiously optimistic. How could it be both? &gt;&gt; Hey, good evening, Elizabeth. Um, and I think anytime the president of the United States puts the words alien and extraterrestrial life into a social media post right next to language saying or suggesting that he will order the release of files related to UFOs. Um it&#x27;s that&#x27;s quite an extraordinary development and that&#x27;s especially the case after 80 years of denial, ridicule and obfiscation from the US government on this topic.</p>
<p>Um that said, as you as you aptly noted, um right, we have seen precedent for a quote unquote nothing burger with some of these other releases that had been hyped. &gt;&gt; Um there&#x27;s a lot of chatter about this potentially being a political distraction. So I&#x27;m I&#x27;m indeed cautiously optimistic. Um, but I do want to maybe just briefly level set because a lot of the coverage that I&#x27;ve seen has been quite dismissive of these comments. Um, but at the end of the day, this is an extremely bipartisan issue.</p>
<p>Chuck Schumer of all people stated on the Senate floor that multiple credible sources have have come to Congress stating that the federal government, the executive branch, has illegally withheld information on UFOs again from Congress. That&#x27;s pretty extraordinary. We&#x27;ve seen these hearings, new videos keep coming out. Uh Marco Rubio stated just in December that generals and admirals, the the top tier of our military, the United States military, told him and the Senate Intelligence Committee, that unreported UFO retrieval and reverse engineering pro engineering programs have uh been withheld from the president. So, there&#x27;s a lot of smoke.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an enormous amount of smoke here. I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic. Let&#x27;s see what happens. If you&#x27;ve been following the story closely, you know, as you have and and we have because we&#x27;ve been reporting on it a lot, we know that it&#x27;s sort of the defense contracting industry um that has been really working on allegedly this reverse engineering project uh taking extraterrestrial remains of or or crashed vehicles and trying to reverse engineer them. They there&#x27;s been almost a deliberate attempt to cut out elected leaders, even elected presidents, because they&#x27;ll be gone in four or eight years.</p>
<p>Whereas for decades, these companies have with these laboratories are able to work in in in extreme secrecy on on extraterrestrial craft. That certainly is the narrative that has developed and that has been told by multiple independent sources and it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a very consistent narrative which makes which is fascinating to your point. Um but yes that is potentially a way of obfiscating freedom of information act laws for example of hiding this this technology if it has indeed recover been recovered. I will say that that Senator Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, um have have really led the charge in this. And if you look at their legislation, the UAP disclosure act, it specifically gets to your point, and it has a requirement for the federal government to assert eminent domain over any and all UAP uh craft that have been transferred to private defense contractors.</p>
<p>and and that extends to quote what they describe as biological evidence of non-human intelligence and that&#x27;s in black and white Elizabeth that&#x27;s pretty extraordinary um but yes you&#x27;re absolutely right so the question is if right if if the any potential release of information is of government files and the bulk of the the equipment the hardware is actually um in private hands that does raise a very interesting issue but um we shall see I for one will be watching uh Tuesday&#x27;s state the Union address very closely um in the event that uh President Trump expands on these comments which as you noted have have really u taken off like wildfire certainly on on social media. &gt;&gt; Do you think he might actually do that? I mean as you point out there&#x27;s bipartisan support for this. Very high ranking members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans have talked about the necessity of releasing these records. Um, you know, it it would be intriguing if he mentioned that &gt;&gt; 100%. Um, but you&#x27;re right.</p>
<p>really quick. If we want to go ahead and codify this stuff, meaning by Congress, if uh if Trump is going to go ahead and release this information and get it out there, do you think there&#x27;s a chance, Darl, for the federal government to go ahead or this the legislative branch to go ahead and codify this with, if you want to call it, legislation that would take this and make it law where this information must be made public? Because Trump&#x27;s only in here for a certain amount of time. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s definitely possible. So yeah, I mean, and it is bipartisan, so yeah, I would say if anything&#x27;s got a chance of passing, regardless of who wins the midterms, that something like that would have a chance. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Mike? &gt;&gt; I think that if he expands on this in the uh national address, then that&#x27;s a step also in the right direction because it means that he&#x27;s pursuing it and following through on it. And it will also change the narrative with the public if it&#x27;s something on a grand scale like that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I really hope he does. &gt;&gt; I think we all hope he does for this point because you know what? This is something, you know, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re not just keeping it out for national security. They&#x27;re hiding the presence of a completely different form of life from all of humanity.</p>
<p>And you know, President Reagan has said, you know, said this many times in the past that what would happen if we had this external threat that was out there that could bring together all of humanity in ways we didn&#x27;t expect. &gt;&gt; He said all of our border wars would come to an end pretty quickly. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So, let&#x27;s continue on with this. Here we go.</p>
<p>And then &gt;&gt; getting to a fever pitch. And I I want to also point out the the film The Age of Disclosure um which did um incredibly well. It was the highest grossing documentary on Amazon Prime Video within 48 hours of coming out. And it has Rubio, uh Senator Gillibrand, um Senator Rounds, all these individuals making pretty extraordinary statements. Um so yes, I think there there really is a a I think we&#x27;re at a critical mass here.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a really a ground swell of both public and congressional legislative support for for true transparency and and after 80 years it&#x27;s time. &gt;&gt; All right, 10 seconds because that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got. Mark, are we ready for it? Because in age of disclosure, they talk about the fact that previous administrations had talked about releasing these files and rule and decided that the American public, the world in fact, wasn&#x27;t ready to learn the the quote truth. Do you &gt;&gt; I think we&#x27;re ready for it. I think the the big question is what happens the the day after geopolitically, economically, socially, and culturally.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. You&#x27;ve given me a lot to think about this weekend, Mark. Great to have you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Really quick along those lines, if we can get into this for a conversation here. Um, the public didn&#x27;t freak out. Trump said he was going to bring, you know, Obama talked about it, saying aliens are real. Trump said, &quot;I&#x27;m going to release all the information to get Obama out of trouble, right? the markets. Oh, Sapphire Elf did not freak out.</p>
<p>People didn&#x27;t go crazy in the streets. People didn&#x27;t stop going to work. Everything is going on as it should. Coming to us from the depths of Australia. Sapphire Elf, what say you? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been saying for a few years that um if you do like public surveys, um do you think aliens are real and do you think they&#x27;ve been here? It&#x27;s like 75% of people think they&#x27;re real and around half the public thinks they&#x27;re already here.</p>
<p>And so I think this old argument of public freak out just doesn&#x27;t hold any water anymore. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know. Yeah. Anyway, that&#x27;s just a lot.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you, sir. Along those lines, I hate to say it, but you know, I actually I love to say this next one. Let me bring this up again here really quick. Uh, a lot of people are going to Oh, an apology to Jario Suclo.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s forever saying I&#x27;m not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens. You know, everyone thought the guy was crazy, but that big hair apparently brought him where it needs to go. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m I&#x27;m trying to get my sucos going at the &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just need a lot of hair product, my friend. [laughter] Thank you. I appreciate that.</p>
<p>All right, let&#x27;s go ahead and I think we&#x27;re finished with that one. And our next one we&#x27;re going to go ahead and bring up, folks. Let&#x27;s go ahead and get to it. All right, our next one. We&#x27;ve got a short clip here coming from Matt Gates.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, he was down at the facility in uh Eglund. Was it Eglund Air Force Base down in Florida? &gt;&gt; Yes, it was him and Burchett and Luna. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And they potentially saw something potentially they&#x27;re going to let Gates see some videos of bodies or things, but they didn&#x27;t happen. Either way, let&#x27;s hear uh Matt Gates, who&#x27;s now looks like he&#x27;s a commentator over at O.</p>
<p>Let me turn off the chat for a second on this one over at O and uh let&#x27;s see where this goes, folks. First time I&#x27;m seeing it as well. Let&#x27;s have fun. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve previously said on our program you believe that there are underwater bases that are being accessed through this transit from extraterrestrial beings. Given how many of these sightings are from naval aircraft and and naval vessels off the coast of San Diego, um is that where you believe some of these underwater bases are likely to be located? &gt;&gt; Yeah, if they&#x27;re there, there&#x27;s five areas in our waters that would that would that I&#x27;ve been told by military officials that and former military officials that they would have to be because outside of quantum physics, there&#x27;s no way something can travel light years.</p>
<p>I mean, how you gonna pack for that? You know, I it&#x27;s I might have to take a pickup truck if I want to travel from Knoxville to Nashville just for all the food and supplies I got to take. So, honestly, Matt, light years, that&#x27;s just out of our realm unless we talk quantum physics and that&#x27;s kind of voodoo to me anyway. I don&#x27;t really understand it at all. [snorts] I just I mean, I know what they&#x27;re telling me. I just don&#x27;t it&#x27;s hard for me to grasp.</p>
<p>So, something would have to be here either for Millennium or or or a base of some sort. And that&#x27;s where it would have to be. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told. I hope we get to the bottom of it. I doubt we will, but this is the start.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, you know, uh, Representative Burch brings out a good point on this one that we&#x27;ve got, you know, we&#x27;ve got these things that are here. They probably have under under sea bases. you know, he doesn&#x27;t think they&#x27;re actually traveling long distances to, you know, like traditional like drive from point A to point B to get here, which leaves the possibility of what we had a had a uh post from who was it? Uh, Representative Anna Pina Luna, who we&#x27;re going to follow up next, talking about wormholes or we have things coming here from other dimensions. But the reality is if they&#x27;re going to be here, they&#x27;re going to have a base of operations. They want to go ahead and be able to, if you want to call it, survive cataclysms that happen on a regular basis on this planet.</p>
<p>The best place they&#x27;re going to go for longtime habitability is going to be the bottom of the oceans. And Tim is on this. It&#x27;s great to see what Tim has to say. If we can, looks like we&#x27;ve got Sapphire Elf with his hand up. Go ahead, Sapphire.</p>
<p>Three, two. Oh, in the meantime, before we get to that, it looks like we just got to have a super chat come in. Let&#x27;s go ahead and thank Brian Pemble, Dan, Dad, Gumma, Thomas. Let&#x27;s get disclosure now. Absolutely, my friend.</p>
<p>Uh, we appreciate Brian for starting off the super chats tonight. That&#x27;s right. We are a fanfunded program and we appreciate everyone&#x27;s love and support of what we do here on Disclosure Tonight. Thank you, Brian, for being a part of the program in the back many times and for your continued support of what we do here at Disclosure Tonight. On that note, now that we&#x27;ve got that at this point, let&#x27;s go ahead and shut this down and let&#x27;s get to our next video clip coming from Anna Pina Luna.</p>
<p>And I got some tweets on her from chat and I&#x27;ll leave. &gt;&gt; What was that again, Sapphire? I didn&#x27;t hear you. &gt;&gt; Can I just communicate with the chat? There&#x27;s lots of people I know from years ago. I&#x27;ve been through trauma recovery. I&#x27;m fine.</p>
<p>Can I talk to the chat and just drop out a call? &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you got to unblock me though. in the chat. You&#x27;re blocked. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;m park elf.</p>
<p>You got to unblock park. &gt;&gt; What is the account name? I&#x27;ll go ahead unblock you right now. &gt;&gt; Elf C. &gt;&gt; All right, give me a second. Let me go back to Huh.</p>
<p>Give me a sec. Let me just take care of this by the way. Good day, Rex. &gt;&gt; Okay, YouTube studio. I need to go down to here and I need to see community uh community moderation.</p>
<p>Where is that at? User management. All right. I need to go to here and say go to here. There&#x27;s a bunch of people. I guess they&#x27;re going to show 336 more.</p>
<p>Elf. Puck. elf. Okay, you&#x27;re fixed, my friend. Taken care of.</p>
<p>You can go ahead. You are back in the chat. See, all you have to do is ask. All right, Mike. Let&#x27;s go ahead and get on to this next clip we have coming up now.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got some business taken care of along the way. And let&#x27;s get to Representative Anna Pina Luna [snorts] who&#x27;s talking about out about this situation. She&#x27;s remember folks, she is the head of the uh task force for the declassification of national secrets. You know, it should have gone to Tim Burchett. Sorry, Anna, but we love Tim more than you do.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re a wonderful person. But, uh, God, we got another super chat that just came in right now. I want to go ahead and thank on this one before we get things started. Uh, Brian Pebble, we had the first one, the second one we just had coming in from. This is Liz W., thank you for digging through all this info for us.</p>
<p>Really appreciate all the work you do. Thank you for recognizing us and thank you for supporting us, Liz. We greatly appreciate your your support of supporting us, supporting you. How about that? Let&#x27;s go ahead now and get this going with Anna Pina Luna. Here we go, folks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Infamous videos that we showed in one of our hearings was actually a video that was dead dropped to Eric Berles, who&#x27;s a member of Congress, um from within the Department of War, and it shows a UAP and unidentified air phenomena deflecting a Hellfire missile. Um this was taken off of ISR footage off the coast of I believe it was Yemen. Um, so long story short, there have been briefings that we&#x27;ve received as Congress that leads us to believe that yes, there is definitely an advanced technology out there that&#x27;s not created by mankind. And yes, of course, we&#x27;ve seen other evidence where it could potentially be UAPs and then we later find out that there&#x27;s drones, but there is a certain amount of evidence that we simply can&#x27;t explain. um [snorts] some of the physics that are defied in how these vehicles operate um are very interesting to note and we are not the only government that&#x27;s you know looked into this extensively but I really do look at this from a lens of national security and as you know as we continue to evolve specifically on the front of AI and drone technology um we have to ensure that a are these things whatever they may be are they potential adversarial uh weapons advanced weapons or not [snorts] and I think the whole aspect that the federal government can deny access to members of Congress of which has happened not just to myself but to other members of Congress as well is not just alarming uh but it&#x27;s also something that cannot truly exist in free and fair society.</p>
<p>Government should not operate in secrecy. And so I look forward to the American people being able to determine their own conclusion after they&#x27;ve seen some of the evidence that we have seen. Uh but most recently, Representative Gates actually came forward. He was on that initial Kodal with me and Representative Tim Burchett where we we were denied access and uh he will tell you that if you&#x27;ve seen some of the stuff that we&#x27;ve seen, you will too become a believer. &gt;&gt; Mike, I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts and anyone else in the back like Daryl&#x27;s on this one.</p>
<p>I need to step away for a second. What do you think, Mike? Oh, I think that uh before Trump and Obama made their announcements recently, Luna had said originally that she was going to be reaching out to, of all places, uh Russia. She wanted to convene and see what they knew about this subject to see if there could be some diplomatic uh negotiations to get an answer out of them. But we know that after the uh speeches that were made and the statements by Obama and by Trump that as far as the Russian country is concerned, they find this to be a laughingstock of the United States. They they&#x27;re not taking this seriously at all.</p>
<p>and their position on it. And I guess that&#x27;s one of the reasons we haven&#x27;t heard anything further from Representative Luna on her Russian negotiations was because they probably weren&#x27;t taking her or this subject too seriously at that time. But as we know from our friend Jean Stiko who comes on the show, we know Russia has a hand in this subject as long as we have, if not longer. and they&#x27;ve done a lot of research on it. She wrote a book about the research that they were doing over there in Mother Russia back during the Soviet Union back in the 80s.</p>
<p>Had a family member that was there working on it. So, their propaganda they&#x27;re putting out about this now is not credible. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s something Yeah, it&#x27;s something that uh you can&#x27;t take seriously coming from them. Unfortunately. So, Darl, any thoughts from your side? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; What&#x27;s &gt;&gt; more political uh bullshit speech? You mean? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I mean, did she did she basically say that she now has more authority that she &gt;&gt; Well, no. She was saying that, you know, I can&#x27;t wait to the American people can see the proof that I&#x27;ve seen. So, she&#x27;s talking about stuff that she&#x27;s seen without talking about it.</p>
<p>thing and she can&#x27;t wait for the American people to see this evidence as well. So, at least from her perspective as the leader of this task force, she knows kind of some of this level of stuff that should be brought out. I want to see what I mean. She originally wanted she originally went down to Fort Walton Beach to Eglund Air Force Base to uh to see the video that they captured or that they took of what Gates described as what three &gt;&gt; UFO aliens &gt;&gt; following around some big giant orb. Anyway, there&#x27;s video of that apparently &gt;&gt; and they know there&#x27;s video of it because they wouldn&#x27;t let her see it.</p>
<p>I mean there there&#x27;s video that&#x27;s out there Luzando&#x27;s there&#x27;s a video out there that Luzando talked about Darl that&#x27;s um where it&#x27;s high definition it&#x27;s very clear and you can see the occupancy of the craft meaning you can see the occupants that there are occupants in this particular craft which if we can get that kind of stuff out more than what she&#x27;s seen that would be amazing. No, I I but I will take I mean I&#x27;m just saying from a personal from her personal interest in the story because she did not like being told no. I hope that she goes and gets it. I&#x27;ll take any proof right now. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; absolutely.</p>
<p>Great points, my friend, all the way around. Um before we get into our next piece, let&#x27;s go ahead and just take a step back. remember what David Gush had said in the past on a NewsNation exclusive with regards to uh Luella I mean uh David Grush what he had said and then we&#x27;ve got our next clip coming up from GB News of Annie McGrillin uh who&#x27;s from that UFO podcast appearing uh talking about what&#x27;s been going on. It&#x27;s great to see coverage on this that&#x27;s from around the world and positive towards our point of view. So on that delay, let&#x27;s go ahead and get this one video up and we&#x27;ll play this one next.</p>
<p>And here we go. When you say crash retrieval, what do you mean? &gt;&gt; Uh, these are retrieving non-human origin uh technical vehicles, if you will, non-human, exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed. We have spacecraft from another species. We do. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And this is the stuff hopefully Trump is going to bring forward, my friends. &gt;&gt; Many quite a number. You&#x27;re kidding. No, I thought it was totally nuts and I thought at first I was being deceived. It was a ruse.</p>
<p>People started confiding in me. They approached me. I have plenty of current former senior intelligence officers that came to me, many of which I knew almost my whole career that confided in me. They were a part of a program. They named the program.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of it. and they they told me based on their oral testimony um and they provided me documents and other other proof that there was in fact a program that the UAP task force was uh not read into. You are alleging that the US government has been concealing the existence on this planet of alien life. &gt;&gt; I would couch it as non-human intelligence. You know, NHI like we like to say in our our language.</p>
<p>Why do you say that? Why do you say NHI? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t want to necessarily denote origin. I don&#x27;t think we have all the data to say, oh, they&#x27;re coming from a certain a certain location. And I and I I couch it as somebody who studied physics where maybe they&#x27;re coming from a different physical dimension as described in quantum mechanics. We know there&#x27;s extra dimensions due to high uh high energy particle collisions, etc. And there&#x27;s a theoretical framework to explain that.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just let me cut to the quick though. You&#x27;re saying there is an intelligent species engaging with this planet? &gt;&gt; Yes, that&#x27;s potentially extraterrestrial. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I speak for everybody sitting at home. That is a shock.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s one hell of a shock, but it also comes down to the situation. We may be looking at, you know, another life form that&#x27;s here on this planet that&#x27;s much more advanced than we are and has been, if you want to call it, uh, involved in humanity and, you know, has been here longer than us, which could means they had their hands in the creation of humanity. Darl, &gt;&gt; yeah, he had he had a choice. He had an interesting word in there, potentially extraterrestrial. So, yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>Um, &gt;&gt; well, we don&#x27;t know. We don&#x27;t have the answers. And if we think we&#x27;re going to get everything out of Trump about what all the answers are, what&#x27;s going on, no, we&#x27;re not going to hear a lot of this stuff until we potentially hear it from the non-human intelligence itself. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, if there&#x27;s some amazing like undersea mall or something and go shopping in, that&#x27;d be cool.</p>
<p>[laughter] &gt;&gt; Hey, it&#x27;s the safest place to be. We&#x27;re all going to be wanting to have under ocean houses to go ahead or underground for that point. You know, living above ground is kind of like the stick uh the three little pigs who made their house out of straw or out of sticks. It&#x27;s not going to last when it comes down to neither will the house of bricks when the water comes across the planet for that matter. You&#x27;re going to have to be underground a safe place to be.</p>
<p>God, Darl, it sounds like there&#x27;s going to be an entire different marketplace for underground builders. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe some guy who has a company called Boring, as in boring through the air. &gt;&gt; A boring company. Yeah, you never know.</p>
<p>We are not going to be able to get everybody to the moon, but we&#x27;ll get a bunch of people underground where it&#x27;s going to be safe. On their next bet, on our next story, we&#x27;ve got uh information coming to us from GBNews.com in this particular instance, but it came from GBNews live in the UK. Uh let&#x27;s go ahead and uh we&#x27;ve got Andy McGrillin in here if who was on initially about a week ago talking about an Obama&#x27;s initial statement. uh now talking about Trump&#x27;s orders to go ahead and release the US alien files. I love it.</p>
<p>This is wonderful, my friends. Could not get any better from this. Well, it will once the information comes out. So, here we go, folks. Here we are again.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s um a few days on from uh my last appearance where we had one president talking about UFOs and aliens and now we have the sitting president talking about [snorts] UFOs, aliens and not only that things seem to have amped up like you say where he&#x27;s now instructed Secretary of War, Department of War and other relevant departments to he&#x27;s not used the word declassify but release files. So, I think that&#x27;s an interesting we we have to be careful with the wording on that. Um, that what we&#x27;re going to get, we don&#x27;t know. But I think there&#x27;s certainly an opportunity here for a very interesting time ahead. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, since we last spoke, President Obama has released a statement on Instagram sort of clarifying his comments, saying that he was asked, &quot;Are aliens real?&quot; He said yes, but but he&#x27;s now said that that was a personal opinion rather than something born of any facts that he as president uniquely got to see.</p>
<p>Yeah. Um, if we want to be really careful about wording and Barack Obama&#x27;s a very eloquent and erodite man. He has a very, you know, astute background in and how he speaks. He said he never saw evidence during his presidency of extraterrestrial life. Now, he still gets classified presidential briefings afterwards, and it&#x27;s been a while since Barack Obama was president.</p>
<p>So, in that time, has Barack Obama seen information or under information that would lean him towards there being something nonhuman? [snorts] And you can even take away he never saw evidence of ET. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not cryptoaterrestrial, non-human, interdimensional, any other kind of phrase you could throw at just sort of picking. I mean, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s on an informal podcast. He&#x27;s not really thinking that carefully about every single word. Are you tempted to go down that sort of slightly too conspiratorial link there? I think given the last couple of months and what&#x27;s been covered on the news in an hourly basis, including by yourselves, conspiratorial goes out the window now, doesn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; Okay, I&#x27;m so sorry.</p>
<p>The end of the hour, &gt;&gt; oh my god, what is that? [laughter] What the hell is even that? I&#x27;ve got a video clip on that one somewhere. Let&#x27;s go ahead and uh Oh boy. Let&#x27;s go ahead. You know, interesting Annie McGrillin to go ahead and talk about this particular situation, where we are in the United Kingdom. Mike, your thoughts on this one? &gt;&gt; Yeah, what the hell was that was right? You&#x27;re not joking.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah. I mean, look, Andy is making the same points, I think, about this that we&#x27;ve been making. We still need to see what&#x27;s going to actually come out before people can uh, you know, make a determination as far as what&#x27;s real and what isn&#x27;t. And also in regards to him having a point about maybe it&#x27;s not extraterrestrial could be interdimensional or we&#x27;ve already had &gt;&gt; or crypto terrestrial meaning it&#x27;s been here it&#x27;s from an old older civilization that advanced and figured out the disaster cycle and was able to go ahead and protect themselves when the planet turns itself over and wipes out the surface. They made it which could be means they&#x27;re millions of years advanced on humanity today.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, it could be any one of a number of things. We have to wait and see what we get, what comes out. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; absolutely. All right.</p>
<p>On our next one, we&#x27;ve got a post coming from Representative Eric Berles. Yes, the burly man is around, my friends. He says, &quot;While I remain skeptical about much of the reporting on UAPs, it&#x27;s very clear the government knows something, the public does not.&quot; This is from an audio clip, probably, I believe, from a radio station. So, let&#x27;s go ahead. This is coming from Representative Eric Burlson&#x27;s website, I mean Twitter feed.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and make this a little bit smaller so you guys can see and make sure we&#x27;ve got it here. All right, we know where it&#x27;s coming from. Let&#x27;s go ahead and play this audio clip so everybody &gt;&gt; can hear it. Here we go, folks. &gt;&gt; I still remain skeptical on this topic.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s necessarily little green men from another planet. Um, but what I can say is that there is so much attention and speculation and we continue to see and record and document objects that we cannot explain. And and I have been in briefings. I&#x27;ve been in in secure settings where I&#x27;ve seen classified videos and information. It&#x27;s obvious that we there&#x27;s something out there that we don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t explain. Now, there&#x27;s reports that we have at like we have crashed vehicles and that we&#x27;re reverse engineering all this. There&#x27;s reports that we have biological bodies and all of this stuff and I have yet to to validate any of that. Um, but what I can validate is that there [clears throat] are objects that are using unconventional propulsion technology that is beyond our capabilities. &gt;&gt; You know, this just begs the question of great debate.</p>
<p>Berles says, &quot;Oh, we don&#x27;t know anything about these things, where they&#x27;re at, where they&#x27;re coming from, potentially what they&#x27;re doing.&quot; Do you think the DoD really doesn&#x27;t know anything or do you think they&#x27;re trying to cover all this shit up to go ahead and uh if you want to call it only give the minimal information to people of Congress because they don&#x27;t need to know. Brian, on that subject, go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think a Berles is hedging his bets here a little bit. Um I think he probably knows more than we think. Um remember he had uh David Grush on a staff.</p>
<p>Um and I think still does, right? I don&#x27;t know if a gush is done, but um Berlesen has also had the ear of President Trump recently and so I can&#x27;t imagine that that any of that stuff was not passed on or that Trump may have been briefed or passed on info back and forth. Um, so I think there&#x27;s probably, you know, I&#x27;m just speculating here, but I think that that this is kind of a nexus of of information between a burlist and the president, but I do think he&#x27;s hedging his bets literally until until he physically sees something. &gt;&gt; Honestly, in the terms of someone going for running for president, I would think Tim Burchett has a better chance than Berles because he&#x27;s so honest and calls things out. He&#x27;s a common sense kind of guy. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to see Berles or Burchchett run for president one day. But I &gt;&gt; I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that he&#x27;s had the ear of the president recently. Burles has. &gt;&gt; Well, you&#x27;ve got him, you&#x27;ve got Annapina Luna, but you know who&#x27;s even more than that? You&#x27;ve got Lara Trump who&#x27;s part of the family for that matter. &gt;&gt; Exactly right.</p>
<p>And then even she was kind of couching her stuff in somewhat cryptic terms. Um, you know, I I don&#x27;t think that any of this is an accident. It&#x27;s not happening in a vacuum. I think that this is probably planned um and and I&#x27;m really hoping, so once again, a speculation here, but that there will be a roll out uh in the next few months. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know, there&#x27;s been also some statements that have been made about Berles kind of saying that, you know, maybe Roswell didn&#x27;t happen.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just a front for something else that was going on. All I have to say is Berles needs to get farther away from freaking Dr. Steven Greer. Mike, your thoughts on that one or not? Brian, anybody in the back? You know, I let me &gt;&gt; Mike must be on the phone with Greer right now or perhaps [laughter] &gt;&gt; someone else. Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, I was busy cursing that name. No, I don&#x27;t think uh Berles&#x27;s affiliation with Greer is really helping disclosure in any way. Not for the government, not for the public. So, yeah, that was a uh dreadful mistake. He made an error in judgment in aligning himself uh with that man.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We know that because, you know, we&#x27;ve been talking about this for very long. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Yeah. For far too long, my friend. It&#x27;s one of those things you look at and you hope it&#x27;s not going to happen and you hope it&#x27;s going to go away, but it doesn&#x27;t because he is there.</p>
<p>He is a force and potentially has been paying people based on tweets we&#x27;ve seen from pop or messages we&#x27;ve seen from Poptart that he has been &gt;&gt; funding people on X to go ahead and uh dissu Alzando and promote Steven Greer like uh what do they call it uh Hood Greer for that matter? &gt;&gt; Greer Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s awful. It&#x27;s just something that uh the people that are in Berles&#x27;s office should be telling him to avoid like the plague.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But for some reason, he&#x27;s like a bad penny. He keeps popping up around Greer. It It&#x27;s just something I don&#x27;t agree with. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>There you go. And the expression of Berles here when he&#x27;s with Steven Greer looking at the supposedly mummies. But here&#x27;s the thing. Everyone was saying, &quot;Oh my god, look, it&#x27;s the mummies. They&#x27;re aliens.&quot; No.</p>
<p>If it does turn out they&#x27;re another form of life, we&#x27;re just looking at something that potentially, you know, why did the hell happened here in this one? Um, this is something that is a different form of life. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s alien, does it? &gt;&gt; Well, no. Didn&#x27;t they recently debunk Haime Musan&#x27;s mummies again? &gt;&gt; Oh, god. Yeah. They&#x27;ve come out and said yes they are human of in origin and you know we have advance we have people who are going ahead and creating these to go ahead and make millions of dollars and you know grift their way into retirement.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well if you take a good look on the Mexican side the Hanim Musan network is pretty similar to what Gre has going on over here. &gt;&gt; So yeah that goes hand in hand with the grifting. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re not [snorts] wrong, &gt;&gt; you know, but but it&#x27;s just, you know, it&#x27;s a topic where there&#x27;s so many people who are interested in what&#x27;s going on and it works down in Central America and South America where there are a little bit less, you know, have a little bit less discretion &gt;&gt; on on what they believe and what they don&#x27;t because it&#x27;s part of their culture. &gt;&gt; Well, it is also over there. They&#x27;re highly religious.</p>
<p>they believe in, you know, Christianity and um anything that comes across like another type of religion they tend to be attracted to. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, [snorts] you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s a good point. I agree.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Did you see Mick West comment by the way on X? &gt;&gt; No, go go for it, Darl. &gt;&gt; No, he just said Trump is obviously joking, but people have hope. &gt;&gt; Oh, god. Mr. Copium himself.</p>
<p>I&#x27; I&#x27;ve had these flashes in my head about, you know, disclosure and getting on a spaceship and going to Alpha Centtory and everybody&#x27;s in line with smiles on their faces and right at the front door is Nick West protesting with a sign that says, &quot;It&#x27;s a balloon.&quot; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Not that&#x27;s a cookbook. It&#x27;s a balloon. &gt;&gt; All right. And our next p of uh one, we&#x27;ve got the the co-conspirator along with Luzando. Remember Lu Lozano had those videos.</p>
<p>He declassified them or got them to be to a lower level of classification and handed them off to Christopher Melon. And that&#x27;s what started this whole thing in 2017. We&#x27;ve got a an expost yesterday from uh Christopher Melon. Let&#x27;s read to it and let&#x27;s get into it, my friends. Uh let&#x27;s go ahead and find this.</p>
<p>Here we go. Make this a little bit to the left and a little bit smaller. I&#x27;m just trying to Yes. If the text is big, I&#x27;m doing this for all of our friends who are on mobile phones, which is almost half of our audience, if not more. Let&#x27;s get to it.</p>
<p>To the extent they follow through, this is a normally positive development, and I commend the administration for taking this step. That said, virtually all relevant documents are classified and identifying and declassifying them will be a lengthy, complex process. My concern is that an executive branch effort, if snarled in turf uh fights and classification nuances, meaning what he&#x27;s talking about are those um career bureaucrats who don&#x27;t agree with where the president is going cuz they&#x27;ve been there for 20 years plus and they&#x27;re not going to listen to it and they&#x27;re going to sloww walk this stuff as much as they can to prevent the truth from coming out. and that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about could end up being misleadingly partial or incomplete because they&#x27;re not going to give us the truth because they don&#x27;t want to as we&#x27;ve seen recently with unrelated disclosure efforts I Congress to support the administration&#x27;s intent by enacting a legislative framework that concretely structures authorize and directs a comprehensive disclosure process both to encourage and help the Trump administration get this done. This is so important, Mike.</p>
<p>Meaning that Trump is going to be there for a period of time and then he&#x27;s going to be gone. We want to get something put into law by Congress that requires all these parts of the executive branch from the DoD to the CIA to the Department of Energy to make this information open to the public. Now, a lot of people are concerned in the military-industrial complex. Oh my god. We may be going ahead and inspiring our enemies on this technology where we&#x27;ve going well just you know what the top ones in Russia and China already know the same stuff we know if not more because they&#x27;ve opened this up to figure it out to more of their audience versus in the United States where we only have a small number of people who are allowed by the industrial the military-industrial complex department of energy and hidden parts of the executive branch to bring out the truth.</p>
<p>Mike, &gt;&gt; yeah, right here. If he wants Congress to take this more seriously, Trump is going to have to sign an executive order declassifying the files that they&#x27;ve been hiding. And once that information starts to come out to the public, not Congress, the public, and they start to see exactly what&#x27;s been going on, there will be such a huge support pushing Congress and our representatives to get that legislation passed. Like when David Grush testified at the UAP hearing on July 26, 2023, the public [snorts] started to take this a lot more seriously. We saw a lot of upswing.</p>
<p>It would take that at this time to get the public to start to recognize that this is something pretty serious. And in the public address that is coming up with Trump, if he mentions this and expands on it, then I think that will start to push things moving in the direction that it started on back in 2023. So hopefully we we get things moving along those lines to get the public to start to support. We need we need to now looking at some uh replies to uh Christopher Melon&#x27;s tweet where Chris is actually responding. I agree, but Congress can&#x27;t get one of the most fundamental pieces of legislation on the floor with 80% public approval.</p>
<p>Where&#x27;s he come back? This is certainly an issue generally, but the passage of the Epstein transparency act [laughter] uh not an insignificant counter example in my mind. Uh this Brad says this is where all the pregame be bipartisansmanship groundwork will heavily come into play and I appreciate you and all the others that have done uh to point this way. It takes a wealth of experience to unravel the complexity. Thank you. And this really comes in and hits the point, Brian, that we need bipartisanship to really bring disclosure forward.</p>
<p>This can&#x27;t be brought forward by one party or the next. Your thoughts and what you had to say? &gt;&gt; Absolut absolutely. And I think we have the votes to do it. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just a matter what happens when when these bills get buried in committees. They get completely undone.</p>
<p>Um and and we&#x27;ve seen that happen time and time again. I would actually be curious uh we&#x27;ve got the State of the Union coming up on Tuesday. I would be curious to see if Trump mentions anything on this topic. If this maybe was the precursor leading in to the State of the Union, I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s going to. I don&#x27;t have the speech.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;re not the first person to say this. We&#x27;re going to take the State of the Union as a lipmus mark to see if this is big enough for him to mention it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because he&#x27;s, you know, this is a joint session of Congress and so he&#x27;s going to be delivering that in front of members. &gt;&gt; This might make a great This might make a great poll actually because I I 100% believe he&#x27;ll say something about it.</p>
<p>Yes. And and and just so you know, you know, who also attends the State of the Union, not only the congressional members, but you&#x27;ve got &gt;&gt; you&#x27;ve got the Armed Services Committee, so you&#x27;ve got all all of the head of generals there. You&#x27;ve also got the Supreme Court and everybody. Um so, you know, let&#x27;s keep our fingers crossed that he does because I think that would go a long way into furthering the legislation. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the perfect time. Yes. You know, calling Congress. I&#x27;m kind of pissed off personally because I&#x27;m in Minnesota and like yesterday I had a, you know, I can show you the videos later. &gt;&gt; The city hasn&#x27;t burned down, has it? &gt;&gt; No, no.</p>
<p>But there was like these, you know, the mystery drone things that were all around and they were heading right towards the airport and I, you know, I got bunch of footage and then I called the FAA. I&#x27;m like, &quot;Fuck it. I&#x27;m gonna call the FAA.&quot; the airport and uh &gt;&gt; they hung up on my face [laughter] as soon as &gt;&gt; they hung up really soon. &gt;&gt; Dude, I&#x27;m like, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m a concerned citizen.&quot; And go like, they knew, man. They I&#x27;m telling you, like, there&#x27;s no way they didn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>And I kind of wanted to get in this because I noticed that when these drones are around the the normal airplanes, they know. They move somewhere else. They don&#x27;t go there. And as soon as they leave, then you start seeing regular planes. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re knowingly diverting traffic as air traffic controllers around where some of this stuff is, shutting down some lanes, if you want to call it, of planes coming into land and take off.</p>
<p>Once those things are gone, they open the traffic to more planes and such. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Interesting enough. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I appreciate that. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s just a lot of things happening. Now, Darl, you said you wanted to bring up a chat a a uh survey. What was the survey, my friend? &gt;&gt; Uh whether or not we think Trump will bring up the fact that he disclosed that that he uh said to have the alien files or however he termed it, released if he&#x27;ll mention it in the State of the Union. &gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.</p>
<p>And I I just think there&#x27;s so many there&#x27;s three things that have happened so quickly and altogether to him to come to this conclusion to release them. And I have to believe that there is a reason why he&#x27;s doing it pre the state of the union. &gt;&gt; All right. So here we go. Trump will mention the alien files as you call them in the upcoming State of the Union.</p>
<p>Folks, this is going to be happening on Tuesday this week. Let&#x27;s see where audience takes this. We could be Oh my god, we are 50/50 split already with 60% of our audience in uh 53% now. Let me go ahead and get the music up that I always forget to turn off. It&#x27;s our audience.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get Okay, Google, set a timer for 1 minute and 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; Sure. 1 minute and 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; All right, there we go. There you go.</p>
<p>Audience, you got a minute and 30 seconds to go ahead and react to this uh survey round to see where you think. Will Trump mention the alien files or disclosure of it in the State of the Union? You know, we&#x27;ve got almost a &gt;&gt; One more thing. One more thing about why I believe this so strongly because Trump would never lend a hand to help Obama in any way. So, I know it was staged. I mean, I I mean, I I it was just the reason to give the declassification or to give the order to have them declassified or whatever the hell that everybody thinks he did.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m still not sure exactly what he did. Release the files. What does that mean? I you know &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Well, you look at this one. This one&#x27;s really tight.</p>
<p>49 to 51% which is 40 seconds left. This is your chance. We got 57 votes in audience. Place your vote. But, you know, this is one of the tightest surveys we&#x27;ve had so far.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re at 50/50 split almost 4951. It&#x27;s close enough to call it even. &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s really really interesting. I also think it&#x27;s really accurate because we and the public don&#x27;t know which way this is going to go. He could say something in the State of the Union address or or he may not.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s too soon to tell. I certainly hope he does. [music] That would give more credence to the statement that he made about this. But we&#x27;re going to have to wait [music] and see what happens on Tuesday at this point. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know what? I am going to end this poll. Uh, we&#x27;re at 5248 and I didn&#x27;t go ahead and take a screenshot of it for posterity, but our audience has spoken, friends. We&#x27;re we&#x27;re at a basically a deadlock of a 50/50 split. Let me step away for a second here. Uh, let&#x27;s go ahead and bring this down here.</p>
<p>I need to get a screenshot of this at least. Where did it go? All right, let&#x27;s bring it up to here. All right, we are at a 51 to 49% split. If you want to bring this up, uh, Brian or Mike, go ahead. I will step away from a second.</p>
<p>Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah, if there was ever a screenshot to get Thomas, this is the one in my opinion because we can come back here later and see where where we think it&#x27;s at. Um, I think if Daryl&#x27;s correct, by the way, that if he does mention this in the State of the Union, um, that this is all planned, which I believe it is as well, that that that everything leading up to this, the tweets and everything with the headset, um, if he mentions it in the State of the Union, then there is a plan in place. In my opinion, if he doesn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know. I think that would be inconclusive.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m just give you a little other one other little data point that I recognize. I I&#x27;ve watched I&#x27;ve watched I probably have I&#x27;ve been to three Trump rallies. I have watched every Trump rally. I&#x27;ve watched pretty much every interview. There&#x27;s something about this.</p>
<p>He has this cocksucker grin on his face that he doesn&#x27;t normally have when he said, &gt;&gt; &quot;Okay, you saw that too on the plane, right? On the plane.&quot; &gt;&gt; It was It&#x27;s a It&#x27;s a face you that I&#x27;ve you rarely see the guy make. And I&#x27;m trying desperately to remember where I&#x27;ve seen this before because it&#x27;s a tell. It&#x27;s a tell of what is going on like and you know and fucking Caroline Leven back there. Excuse my language. You know glowing like Thomas was saying uh there&#x27;s this there&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost like it was stage.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s almost like he was looking for approval for his act or something. You know what I mean? with that grin on his face and it it just the whole it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s weird. It&#x27;s a weird deal. Okay. I saw the same thing, Darl, when he was on that plane there there was a different face on Trump and he was kind of smiling like he knew something that that you people did.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Huh? What do you you know, it&#x27;s already in the works. I I would agree with you. I study politics quite a bit. Um and and and that&#x27;s kind of the exact same thing that I thought. &gt;&gt; Well, we also know that his son Don Jr.</p>
<p>is a big advocate on this subject. So, it hits pretty close to home for him talking about this and addressing it with the American people, the public, the people. So, I think that he&#x27;s getting pushed probably in a few different directions to pursue this. Let&#x27;s see. &gt;&gt; If he addresses it at the public address, that would really, I guess, give us more data points as far as where he&#x27;s coming from with all this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I would agree with you, Mike. And and and and if uh if there&#x27;s anybody that wants to disclose the existence of nonhuman intelligence, um you need somebody with the ego of Trump to do it. I guarantee you he would want to. Um and Thomas was back, but but I mean he he would be the guy. And I just another thing I can&#x27;t help but continue to think about this for some reason when we think of the timing.</p>
<p>You know, there&#x27;s obviously a timing or cadence to what&#x27;s happening, a very quick cadence. And it&#x27;s uh it just makes me wonder if Steven Spielberg&#x27;s movie isn&#x27;t somehow &gt;&gt; a part of that timeline. &gt;&gt; I I Who&#x27;s part of the timeline? &gt;&gt; What if it actually is the day of disclosure? What if it is the aliens talking to us? &gt;&gt; You never know. But coming to us from Annapina Luna, we have a tweet that came to us yesterday at 1:22 p.m. Pacific.</p>
<p>All it shows is something that&#x27;s called a wormhole. Showing that instead of going a long distance from one spot to the next, they&#x27;re actually traveling in a direct space from point A to point B. Like that. Could this be Anna Pelina Luna going ahead and trying to say yes, we&#x27;re dealing with things. We have an idea of how they&#x27;re getting there, how they&#x27;re getting here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It obviously is what she&#x27;s trying to communicate. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m glad to see she&#x27;s getting an education as a congressperson. &gt;&gt; Glad to see some uh posts that don&#x27;t include a swimsuit, &gt;&gt; her campaign photos. Yeah. That we already played on the show here.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No caption. No, nothing. Just a really good picture of a wormhole.</p>
<p>Which wormhole is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, we already know that David Grush testified under oath and stated that there is extradimensional technology at play and the government is aware of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, anything coming from her at this point on that subject, I don&#x27;t consider it to be original coming from her.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In my opinion, he&#x27;s already repeating what we&#x27;ve already heard. &gt;&gt; Oh gosh. Yes. Echo chamber, my friend.</p>
<p>I guess that&#x27;s what we truly call an echo chamber of what&#x27;s going on right &gt;&gt; now. Talking about what&#x27;s going on around the world. uh if we set our sights on well this isn&#x27;t the one but we&#x27;ll get to it. Yes. Um this uh deals with their friends over in Europe at this point.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go ahead and bring it up. Around a dozen F-22s pass through the UK on their way to the Middle East and over in Salt Bay, Greece, people are spotting uh F-35s, A-10 tankers, transports, and the whole lineup. Why? Because apparently, Mike, the United Kingdom, more importantly, Kier Starmer has said that the United States cannot have any of their equipment in the UK that is being dispersed and sent across to Iran at this point in time, &gt;&gt; which is really odd because the, you know, Britain is supposed to be an ally of the United States. Why would they block us like this? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t have any idea. any any thoughts from anyone in the back who may be from the UK who could say their possible understanding of why he would block it.</p>
<p>Does do they not agree with potentially uh what the United States is doing? &gt;&gt; Uh right. Um sorry because I I know Alice has had her hand up for a little while. Can I very quickly jump in this because Andy I think I&#x27;m from the UK. Um yeah, they didn&#x27;t actually block I don&#x27;t believe, this is my own understanding, they they didn&#x27;t block the aircraft from from passing transiting through the uh the air bases. They just stop them from actually using them for actually attacking if if they do hold an attack.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So if they go from the UK fair for wherever they&#x27;re at and they fly directly to attack, UK said you can&#x27;t do that from our land. But if they&#x27;re coming in and they hop, skip, and jump from the United States to the United Kingdom and go across to Greece, who&#x27;s opened up their air bases to us. Thank you for that. To go that can happen. &gt;&gt; I believe that&#x27;s the case.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, these these guys are flying, you know, thousands of miles across the pond, so they&#x27;re going to need a rest up, you know. So I I I you know, I think that&#x27;s that actually what&#x27;s happened. They they&#x27;ve not completely refused them to fly in and out of the UK because they&#x27;ve been doing it for weeks now. They&#x27;ve actually just refused them.</p>
<p>You you can&#x27;t do like they did with in in Gulf War II is sending the B-52 bombers to bomb directly from Fairford, you know. I I saw the things flying over my my head when they went, you know. But um I do believe they&#x27;ve allowed them to to transit through &gt;&gt; but not actually undertake the combat missions from our soils. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Andy, if I I&#x27;ve got another clip here coming in from Cree where UK says no to Trump, Greece says yes.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s uh today&#x27;s UK not so friendly to the US can count on PM Starmer has blocked the US from using RAF air bases. Greece however a reliable friend and ally to the US has given the green light for it to use our bases. And here we got a video of what&#x27;s going on in CIT right now with a lot of our tankers and transports and everything lining up on the airports there. So we&#x27;ll have to see where it goes. Alice, go ahead.</p>
<p>back to uh Trump in disclosure. Um I kind of feel that it&#x27;s a ploy at this point. I don&#x27;t know the reason, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be as big as everybody thinks. &gt;&gt; Well, nothing ever goes as big as anybody thinks. I guess it comes down to uh um you know, re contain your expectations, stay in the middle, know that something&#x27;s going to come.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s never going to be as much as we want. You know, Alice, it may just be as Lu Alzando has said in the past, it may just be an acknowledgement which in its own opens a lot more things for the for the general public to uh understand. &gt;&gt; I think uh thank you. I think Obama, the way I read it, he didn&#x27;t really want to say it, but maybe he was told, &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s break this open.&quot; And he kind of made the statement where he was like, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m I don&#x27;t really want to say it, but yeah, I&#x27;m going to say it. But he said it a bunch of times in other interviews in the past.</p>
<p>This isn&#x27;t the first time, but this is the first time he kind of crossed that line and actually acknowledged it and said, &quot;Well, aliens are real.&quot; &gt;&gt; He even said in the last election, I remember there was an ad where he said, &quot;And we&#x27;re the party that gave you aliens.&quot; &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s not a big disclosure from from Obama either. in the face. &gt;&gt; Well, not until we get all the papers out. No, they&#x27;re just saying there&#x27;s something there. Now, we&#x27;re going to turn to all the different parts of the executive branch to start bringing out the truth.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. And uh just one other thing, the face with Trump. I think that&#x27;s his face when he&#x27;s giving something away. Like he knows he&#x27;s kind of full of BS with this. And and &gt;&gt; I have to completely disagree.</p>
<p>Who did you vote for in the last election, Alice? Uh, I was uh I&#x27;m taking the fifth on that. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you voted for Biden. We got you. You know, we&#x27;re all in different sides of this.</p>
<p>I try to stand in the middle and I I&#x27;m going to look at this and say, you know what? This is something that the the American people deserve. Let&#x27;s throw identity politics off to the side. We&#x27;ve got support from the left, from Obama. We have support from the right coming from Trump. It seems like there was a handoff.</p>
<p>And you know what? If this is what we can get outside of identity polit politics, I&#x27;ll take whatever we can get. &gt;&gt; I agree. I don&#x27;t understand why it mattered who I voted for. &gt;&gt; Well, it does because in in the tone you&#x27;re taking, I would just want her to know potentially where you&#x27;re coming from because everybody has a bias in it. Potentially &gt;&gt; Obama and Trump, it&#x27;s Democrat and Republican.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not really one side. But I know, but if you&#x27;re looking at one side more critically than the other, it could be because you&#x27;ve support one side more than the other. That&#x27;s okay. We&#x27;re we&#x27;re cool with it, Alice. &gt;&gt; I just so you know, I&#x27;m not very politically minded.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, good. Thank you, Alice. We appreciate that. I appreciate &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Greatly.</p>
<p>I I think there&#x27;s good people on both sides and bad people on both sides. &gt;&gt; How about all politicians? Let&#x27;s just throw them all under the bus. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, that I can&#x27;t say. Have you ever found an honest politician who didn&#x27;t accept a free cup of coffee which be considered really a bribe? No, you haven&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; There also people on no sides in both parties because there is no other significant party where your vote makes a difference.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I&#x27;ve basically been no affiliation most of my life. &gt;&gt; Well, same here. I voted for Obama three times. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve voted for Trump three times. &gt;&gt; I have voted for Trump.</p>
<p>I I just personally don&#x27;t like his um postures. That&#x27;s all. That&#x27;s okay. Political. &gt;&gt; Everybody sees this a bit differently and we appreciate your thoughts on this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Getting into a little bit more political things for our friends over in the United Kingdom. I&#x27;ve got a video clip here that I think you&#x27;ll uh understand. Yes, it&#x27;s happening again in the United Kingdom. the our friends, our our patriots, our people who love the United Kingdom for what it&#x27;s about.</p>
<p>Um, are out marching again in the streets, uh, coming from, uh, God save, uh, Great Britain, uh, patriots waving British and English f flags have completely gridlocked Manchester City Center in a major fight back against immigration. They&#x27;re, in other words, they&#x27;re tired of their country getting overrun, their communities overrun by immigrants who are coming in where they&#x27;re getting major funding, they&#x27;re getting housing, they&#x27;re getting food, and the the people who are there who&#x27;ve been paying the taxes, the actual citizens of this country are actually getting kicked to the curb. And you know what? The people who live there are fighting back. Let&#x27;s get to this little 30 43 second clip. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We love you.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, as you heard from the leader of Britain First himself, today marks Manchester for the English. And this is the one of the first times a major right-wing political party has talked about remigration. The concept of the repatronation of people who democratically um you know risk the security of our people. There you go. It&#x27;s happening Andy.</p>
<p>People are coming out across the country once again. There are even some uh anti-protesters of Muslim orientation who are going and attacking some of the people who were out there. but they quickly got chased by thousands of people. So, it it&#x27;s great to see what&#x27;s going on in the UK and people are doing what they can to stand up for their rights. Kyle, go ahead.</p>
<p>I was just going to say on as far as the UK and their airspace, um most of the craft are operating out of uh Jordan. Uh they&#x27;re landing uh on the edge of uh Jordan and Iraq. And that&#x27;s that&#x27;s surprising because that&#x27;s a small air base. But the UK has been running flights over there almost non-stop. Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh some into Jordan and a lot into Cyprus. So um the Stormer&#x27;s full of shit. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve even I&#x27;ve seen fighters land in in Jordan. Uh UK fighters. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>UK media calling, this is coming from Lord McCormack out of the United Kingdom. He&#x27;s a cook over there. We haven&#x27;t seen in a while. Thank you for that super chat, my friend. UK media calling Union Jack flags as far right.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t make this shit up. Yes, they&#x27;re calling out the people who are going out there and saying these aren&#x27;t patriots. These aren&#x27;t people who value the, you know, what what United Kingdom is. They&#x27;re calling them far right. You know what? Even if it came out before, we had earlier this week, we had uh Kira Starmer calling these types of people terrorists.</p>
<p>Does this look like terrorists to you, Jay? &gt;&gt; No, it doesn&#x27;t. I mean, all they&#x27;re doing is just walking around, but I mean, they&#x27;re saying what they believe. Um, it it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re busting in windows or, you know, causing trouble or anything like that. I I don&#x27;t see any of that. I see them speaking their mind.</p>
<p>Um, if you if you check out Thomas, uh, I thought it was curious. Um, I emailed you something, a post on Facebook that&#x27;s going out. The Black Vault servers got erased yesterday and he had to back the entire server up. &gt;&gt; So, the Black Vault got hacked and his servers were deleted. &gt;&gt; He Yeah, he came in and had to uh back up the or had to back up the entire server.</p>
<p>He had to restore the server because something happened with the server in his entire archive. &gt;&gt; Apparently he well great he had a backup. There&#x27;s something called high availabil Hadr which stands for high ail availability disaster recovery. And it sounds like he had either in another region or someplace else. He had a full backup of of that particular platform.</p>
<p>Mistakes happen. Stuff happens all the time with regards to you know data being lost. But uh you know it&#x27;s great that uh the Black Vault went and followed best practices for you know digital content to make sure in case of a mistake or in case of of a disaster you can bring it back. &gt;&gt; What was that again Jay? &gt;&gt; I said always have a backup. &gt;&gt; Always have a backup.</p>
<p>And sometimes you need to have a backup of your backup. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. Let&#x27;s get back into this.</p>
<p>What else we have got going on? Uh, interesting. A friend of the British prime minister, let&#x27;s get this coming to us from GB News. Uh, British Prime Minister exploited his power to help Islamists avoid trials while cracking down on white British people for being Islamophobic. The global establishment in the UK must keep on getting exposed. Let&#x27;s go ahead and play this Kip clip to go ahead and keep everybody up to date on what&#x27;s going on in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The attack on free speech, more importantly, the attack on the citizens who live there. And they just want to keep their country for what it&#x27;s fought for in World War I, World War II, what they&#x27;ve, you know, put into it from getting destroyed completely. Let&#x27;s go ahead and play this next clip here. Uh, where is this at? Here we go. There are yet more calls for the attorney general, Lord Hermer, to resign or be sacked after it emerged he declined to review unduly lenient sentences for terrorist and pedophiles.</p>
<p>Lord Hermer did nevertheless sign off the prosecution of Lucy Connelly, who received a 31-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to stirring up racial hatred. He&#x27;s also been accused of hypocrisy today after it emerged that the UK is not among nine countries calling for reform of the ECR despite Lord Herma apparently specifically saying he would do so and us having 1200 mostly young men just nipping across the channel on Saturday. These latest revelations come just days,200 new people coming across the channel seems like a daily occurrence and there&#x27;s no stopping it and they just bring them in. They give them housing. They give them food.</p>
<p>They give them a stipen. They give them a cell phone. Yet, what&#x27;s going on with all the veterans in the United Kingdom itself? What goes on with all the less fortunate people who are already in the UK United Kingdom? They&#x27;re being looked over for what essentially is replacement theory. &gt;&gt; Apologize over comments in which he compared calls to leave the ECR to the rise of Nazism. I&#x27;m joined now by the former editor of his son, Calvin McKenzie.</p>
<p>Calvin, has he got to go? Uh well he may have to go but of course he&#x27;s good mates with uh the current prime minister who I think is probably in the similar sort of position as chem to be honest. Be lucky if he&#x27;s here next May but dealing with this serious issue. He&#x27;s the attorney general. He is the top of the legal pyramid in this country. I didn&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t think anybody else knew that he&#x27;d signed off on the Lucy Connelly uh prosecution.</p>
<p>I would say that was pretty unusual to start with. The other aspect to look at it, which is rather rather I lower my eyes at it, is that he made his money in the in the in the past being human rights lawyer &gt;&gt; as did um as did the prime minister. They were used to fighting for foreigners and trying to keep them in their country despite the fact that everybody in their country while those two were making money out of it would have got rid of them. So if Lucy Connelly said something disobliging about foreigners, &gt;&gt; isn&#x27;t it s not surprising that he feels he must act for them? And isn&#x27;t it even worse as has been revealed and I think by um Richard Ty tonight that he refused to have a look at the sentence of a rapist who only got 28 months for attacking a woman. Right? There&#x27;s no ifs and buts about that.</p>
<p>He gets 28 months and yet 31 months for Lucy Connelly is considered appropriate. It&#x27;s a tweet for God&#x27;s sake. It doesn&#x27;t mean anything. One moment of anger suddenly becomes more important than a physical attack on a woman. Is that correct? And is it correct, by the way, that he also refuses to have addressed by the uh judges a sentence for a chap called Muhammad who had sent money which he knew was going to a Syrian &gt;&gt; who was going to deal with it and send it towards terrorism.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t do anything about what do you would that be anything to do with his own background of making money out of those kind of communities for donkey&#x27;s years. So what do you think? Well, yeah. No, it&#x27;s a fair question because of of where we are where there are is a procession of what many people might regard as inexplicable decisions on top of the fact that he&#x27;s been inexplicably appointed as our attorney general. He&#x27;s an international human rights lawyer who mysteriously has a back catalog of representing I would argue some of the worst people that have ever walked the face of the earth. A bizarre career choice who is now the attorney general who gets a say over basically the country&#x27;s laws etc.</p>
<p>I mean, why on earth is he in this position? I mean, and should should this should we be worried about it? &gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;d be worried about it in one respect. After all, he had no political background. The reason he got the job is because he was one of Star&#x27;s mates. &gt;&gt; And you can imagine, can&#x27;t you, that they talk about legally all day long. They talk about the great triumphs they&#x27;ve had by keeping various foreigners with rather dodgy backgrounds in our country and the kind of people that they like they like acting for.</p>
<p>got kind of Adams of this world, right? So they they have plenty in common. Starmmer probably doesn&#x27;t have many friends. When you see him in action, you can understand that if you were in a pub and you saw a star, you&#x27;d be out of that pub at 100 miles an hour. Whereas the funny thing is with Farage, actually, if you saw in there, you&#x27;d dive in to have a pipe. That is the difference.</p>
<p>And I so I feel very concerned about this guy. And and by the way, I all the all the back all the back stuff coming out of the cabinet is that they can&#x27;t stand him either. They can&#x27;t stand him because he&#x27;s a nitpicking lawyer. I can&#x27;t stand him because of his actions. I I I I I really think that we are essentially being led by people who for whatever reason didn&#x27;t go to Oxbridge and maybe that weighs heavy like a giant ship on their shoulders and have spent the last however many decades telling each other how brilliant and intellectual they are who are now coming into contact with reality and actually people don&#x27;t really like them and their views aren&#x27;t that popular.</p>
<p>Tough way to find out, isn&#x27;t it? But Kelvin, look, thank you very very much. &gt;&gt; Interesting times of what&#x27;s going on in the UK, Mike. You know, we we have a lot of friends and family over there. We&#x27;re all concerned about what&#x27;s going on and that&#x27;s why we cover this because it&#x27;s an attack on the people of United Kingdom. We see this going on throughout Europe and the the people pushing back.</p>
<p>We see it going on in the United States. It&#x27;s even going up in in Canada where you know the existing uh even in Chicago recently. I read a story about this earlier today to where the uh the African-American population, black population is actually fed up with what&#x27;s been going on with the immigrants coming to Chicago where they&#x27;re getting three, four, $5,000 a month to go ahead and give them housing to go give them food, give them a cell phone, give them money to spend. They&#x27;re getting clothing. Yet people who are in the city of Chicago that need the city support, you know what they&#x27;re walking away with, Mike? $100, maybe $200 in funding when all this other money is being pushed into the into the people who aren&#x27;t here legally.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Which would then explain, Thomas, why the city of Chicago is going to hell in a hand basket. There was a story that came out recently about uh an NBC news reporter, a woman, and in broad daylight in Chicago, 100 p.m. she was physically dragged out of her car and carjacked &gt;&gt; and nobody would stop it. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s become like the wild wild west in that city. It&#x27;s lawless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re focusing on the immigrants instead of focusing on protecting their own citizens. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, &gt;&gt; pretty bad. the governor of of Illinois is coming saying we&#x27;re broke. We can&#x27;t, you know, essentially saying, &quot;We&#x27;re broke. We can&#x27;t afford the Chicago Bears.&quot; And they&#x27;re getting ready to go ahead and leave and go to Hammond, Indiana, where I know, at least in Indiana, that means, Daryl, you&#x27;re going to be getting the Indiana Bears or the Hammond Bears.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If Chicago loses the Bears after all this time, that&#x27;s not something they&#x27;re going to easily recover from. &gt;&gt; Oh, of course not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to they would change the name. It&#x27;d still be the you know, you know how we&#x27;re Hammond&#x27;s close to Chicago.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But we&#x27;ve had other, you know, we had the 49ers move. We had a bunch of different teams move around to different places and when they do, they keep the name, but they they take the new city where they&#x27;re going towards. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, those are major cities. Hammond is not a major city. You have the you have you don&#x27;t have like, you know, name any small town in America.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll be it&#x27;ll be Chicago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you know what? Who&#x27;s you know who&#x27;s coming up for election this fall? JB Prrisker. Let&#x27;s see if he makes it. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s a moron.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. Here&#x27;s one thing. I I did not know this. And while I&#x27;m not a big fan of him, some people are out there, but I&#x27;m going to go ahead and play this clip even if I get hit for it because I didn&#x27;t know that. Did you know that Mike or Daryl that Alec Jones was once a Screen Actors Guild Voice over King? &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Doing voices like Optimus Prime and doing commercials and everything? &gt;&gt; No. Alex Jones was not Optimus Prime. &gt;&gt; Oh, wait. Here we go. He&#x27;ll do the voice.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s play it. &gt;&gt; Got it. By the way, have you ever done any sound effects for Hollywood? For movies? You would kill it. You done it? &gt;&gt; Have you ever done any sound? You know, I&#x27;ve never watched one of his podcasts. He&#x27;s not on my list, but hear him do the voices and stuff.</p>
<p>I get it. &gt;&gt; You know, before Obama came along, I never tried to get in in in that. And then people said, &quot;Hey, you want to do a voiceover for this?&quot; So they they taffed Heartley. My voice is out right now. I can do better ones.</p>
<p>But they, you know, Taff Harley&#x27;s when they put you in movies and stuff, you&#x27;re automatically on the screen actors go. And so I got to where right as Obama got in uh I had some voiceovers because I was in the Screen Actors Guild where it was being aired on TV over and over again. I would get like $500,000 checks. One ad. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I would. I swear to God. And then they found out, wait a minute, you don&#x27;t like Obama.</p>
<p>So then they [clears throat] I got black ballalled and and and no more jobs. &gt;&gt; So give me one of the examples of what you did. Like what cartoons you do it for? I mean, I did I did movies, cartoons, and &gt;&gt; seriously, what I got paid the most for was like insurance company ads. &gt;&gt; Rob, did you know this? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I had no clue.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t know it either. &gt;&gt; Insurance company ads. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#x27;ve done like whatever the names were. I hear mutual.</p>
<p>[laughter] &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s going to get better. &gt;&gt; But you got the voice of God, too, is what they call it. No, no, but but even though my voice is I I can give you some of the voice of God. Voice of God&#x27;s like any of that big like a return the map. Return what you have stolen.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re in grave danger. So that&#x27;s like from Time Bandits. Uh I can do U. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great. &gt;&gt; Autobots.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Autobots transform and roll out. Megatron prepare to die. [laughter] Megatron. [clears throat] But but but but if I wasn&#x27;t sick, I could do better. And here&#x27;s Darth Vader.</p>
<p>If you only knew the power of the dark side. join me and I will complete your training. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I can do um &gt;&gt; but like I have an insurance company ad or like a stock ad. It was like I said it was a financial ones I got paid a lot cuz I forget that one. It was end of America and it was like selling all sorts of financial stuff and instruments and it was like it was like experts believe the end of you know and it was all this stuff and and I I used to see it I&#x27;d be in restaurants or bars and the ad was on. &gt;&gt; They had no idea but I Megatron prepared to die. I love it.</p>
<p>I had no idea that he had his part of this. I saw this clip and I was just like, you know what, Mike? I need to go ahead and clip this and play it back for the audience because somebody doesn&#x27;t know and I&#x27;m not a follower of Alex Jones. I&#x27;ve never watched any of his podcasts. We know he&#x27;s extreme right on that partic or extreme right on that well audience is extreme right on that side of the fence. Yes.</p>
<p>But he&#x27;s got the voice. He can do it. &gt;&gt; He did an imitation of it. &gt;&gt; No, but he got paid to do all that stuff. You know, it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t uh Optimus Prime in the movies.</p>
<p>It was Optimus Prime in the cartoons. &gt;&gt; No, the same actor, the voice actor who did Optimus Prime in the cartoons and the movies is an actor by the name of Peter Cullen. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s been doing it for decades. &gt;&gt; Well, we&#x27;ll have to go ahead and find out all the different things in it. Either ways, he&#x27;s got a voice beyond [laughter] &gt;&gt; I I I&#x27;ve seen his podcast and he&#x27;s just really a little too much to take.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I know he&#x27;s too much for me. I just saw the stuff on the voiceovers and he&#x27;s got a decent voice what he can do. Good for him. He used to make a half a million dollars a year do actually off of one commercial. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Until he got taken to court by those parents. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Some shit happened. Yeah. people say some things and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not going to throw him under the bus for that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just talking about it&#x27;s nice to hear a good voice actor out there. Now, meanwhile, Hungary attends Trump&#x27;s Board of Peace. Sounds like the replacement coming for the United Nations. Uh the will of uh against the will of Ursula&#x27;s God, how do we get Ursula in? Isn&#x27;t that like the name of the evil uh witch from uh Little Mermaid? Yeah, &gt;&gt; actually it is. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, let&#x27;s hear what uh Victor has to say about what&#x27;s going on. &gt;&gt; Hungary is the only country to be represented here on the highest level among the founding members from the European Union. [snorts] I represent a country which has been living in the neighborhood of a broader war for the last four years. We all know this war would not have broken out if President Trump had been in office at that time. However, President Trump&#x27;s return to office a great chance to multiply the peace efforts not only in Gaza but in Ukraine as well.</p>
<p>We in Europe understand clearly that the security situation in Middle East and especially in Gaza has a significant impact on the security of Europe. Therefore, our participation in the bord peace is not only based on principle but also on our own security interest. Let me also share with you that there is serious talks going on in Europe about the board of peace and its future role. We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally.</p>
<p>We are sure that President Trump&#x27;s initiative to [clears throat] establish the board of peace is such a step to the right direction. &gt;&gt; Interesting to see how Hungary is pushing back on where the EU is. There&#x27;s a lot of countries, there&#x27;s a lot of people pushing back. It&#x27;s just a interesting uh if you want to call a situation that Europe and is dealing with at this point. Um can&#x27;t wait to see where this all heads towards.</p>
<p>Um let&#x27;s see what else I&#x27;ve got here. All right, heading back to UFOs for a second. Let&#x27;s let&#x27;s take this one with a grain of salt. We have Ross Kolhar talking about the Epstein files. Intriguing references where Jeffrey is talking about information from prominent physicists.</p>
<p>But wait, yes, we got to talk about that next. A a prominent physicist in California was just killed again. This marks the second top physicist we&#x27;ve had in our country has been murdered unknowingly. My god, it sounds like what&#x27;s what was going on in the uh uh the third body body problem where top physicists around the world were getting terminated to prevent them from knowing the truth. Let&#x27;s play this clip coming coming from uh Ross Colart on NewsNation.</p>
<p>All right, here we go. Let&#x27;s play it. All right, folks. Here we go. In the Epstein files, there are multiple references, intriguing references, where Jeffrey Epstein, incredibly is soliciting information from prominent physicists about propulsion and energy systems.</p>
<p>I suspect he was doing this on behalf of the Israelis. Okay? &gt;&gt; And I hope it wasn&#x27;t on behalf of the Russians because that&#x27;s another thing. He had a close relationship with the Russians. Let&#x27;s hope that it was with the Israelis. If that&#x27;s the case, it does imply what Him is shed, the leader of the Israeli space program, he&#x27;s the previous head of the Israeli space program, and he spoke up in a Hebrew newspaper quite a few years ago now and did this extraordinary interview where he revealed that Israel was well aware of the US legacy retrieval program for alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>and he implied very strongly that there was a high degree of collaboration between Israel and the United States on propulsion systems and technology like energy systems and I think it&#x27;s no coincidence that the Epstein files that have still to be released some of the redacted files very clearly show that there is a high degree of um uh interest by Epstein in energy systems and propulsion systems. Yeah, interesting enough to say the least. I&#x27;ve got another video clip here coming in from NB uh ABC CBS News out of Los Angeles talking about a uh prominent physicist who was murdered on his front porch. And as our audience has is agreed, this is something that aligns to what was going on in a third party a third party problem. What kind of science is going on out there that we&#x27;re trying and there&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s trying to keep silence from the public warning tonight after a renowned astrophysicist was killed during a carjacking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Carl Grillmeer was described as a brilliant man, a man who helped us better understand our own planet and the vast universe that surround us. CBSLA&#x27;s Hunter Sards live at Caltech in Pasadena with the very latest on this story. Hunter &gt;&gt; Juan Susie Carl was known here on this campus for his humor and for his creativity. Those I spoke to today said this is not only a huge loss for loved ones, it&#x27;s a huge loss for the entire field of science. Shock and sadness on the campus of Caltech as colleagues mourn the loss of groundbreaking astrophysicist and astronomer Carl Grommy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We are shocked. This was so unexpected. car was full of life. &gt;&gt; The 67year-old killed Sunday in the Analopee Valley spent decades devoted to understanding the galaxies, studying the Milky Way, and making groundbreaking discoveries, helping scientists better understand our planet. &gt;&gt; He was my mentor, uh, my companion, my buddy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sergio Farardo Aosta knew Grommy for 26 years and worked alongside him at Caltech&#x27;s IPAC department. key is and I say in the present tense car is irreplaceable because the ingenuity he injected into into his research in astronomy is unparalleled. &gt;&gt; According to the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department, they responded early Monday morning to a shooting in the town of Lo, southeast of Palmdale. They say around the same time, reports of a carjacking eventually led them to the suspect accused of shooting Grommy, who was quickly arrested and charged with murder and carjacking. Grommyer is now being remembered for his brilliance and generosity.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Always ready to teach to to share his knowledge. He never held anything back. &gt;&gt; Grower&#x27;s work spans decades, degrees, and achievements with specific breakthroughs in the study of stellar streams. He made numerous scientific [music] discoveries. While at Caltech, he worked for the Spitzer Science Center and in 2011 was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.</p>
<p>He was an inspiration. &gt;&gt; And the suspect &gt;&gt; interesting to this &gt;&gt; has been identified as 29year-old Freddy Snider. He&#x27;s behind bars right now for carjacking and murder on a $2 million bond. We have reached out to the sheriff&#x27;s department for more information on the circumstances leading up to this shooting, if this was random or targeted. Of course, we will continue to follow this story for you.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re reporting live tonight in Pasadena. Hunter Sards, CBSLA. Hunter, thank you so much. &gt;&gt; There we go, my friends. And another clip we have coming just from X.</p>
<p>Something Jesse Michaels just broke. We&#x27;ve got an interesting video coming up talking about a uh people in Sweden who have just gotten access to their UFO files. Uh let&#x27;s go ahead and listen to this clip and it gives you an idea of the what you can go ahead and get into on a 3 to four hour long form interview coming from Jesse Michaels. Let&#x27;s play this intro clip. Here we go, folks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not only [music] UFO library. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s about the unknown. &gt;&gt; So, how many countries do you have files from? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. I have no answer to that. But we have Japanese files, for instance, and Russian files.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And they went out on in the field and brought back debris. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; From this crashed object. They were standing on the other edge of this carriage and they had very tight helmets, small small heads and some gloves. She was 8 m from them.</p>
<p>Meet Claus von, journalist, author, and one of the world&#x27;s most impressive UFO researchers. He&#x27;s a real life Swedish fox moulder, and that&#x27;s because he&#x27;s basically in possession of the modern X-Files. I&#x27;m not kidding. Since the early 1970s, Spawn has not only reported on the phenomena for Sweden&#x27;s largest newspaper, but he&#x27;s spent decades [music] building, organizing, and preserving what is widely recognized as the world&#x27;s largest UFO archive, the Archives of the Unexplained. This 16 [music] room building houses detailed witness reports, photographs, audio recordings, radar data, video, [music] and original first generation documents that no longer exist anywhere else.</p>
<p>[music] Time travel. There&#x27;s a time travel section. What is this? Brown and Buridge. Towns in Brown. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I went to Eureka, California. &gt;&gt; I met with this guy in his garage. We packed it all together and sent it back to Sweden. Behind you here is the oldest UFO group in the world, Borderland Science Research Association. What? There&#x27;s something very interesting about them.</p>
<p>They were new more than intelligence ina [music] certain cases in the &#x27; 40s. In this episode, we go over a half century of overlooked evidence. radar tracked objects executing impossible right angle turns, military helicopters nearly colliding with wingless craft, sonar and radar returns, and of course covert European UFO crash retrieval operations. You know what we&#x27;re going to need, folks, on this one, honestly, is we&#x27;re going to need to get all this data digitized and thrown into an AI model, Mike, so we can go ahead and understand what is the culmination of all this information, which is something would take a human so much time to get through, but an AI platform should be able to get to it and just know instantly &gt;&gt; pretty goddamn quickly. That&#x27;s a good point, Thomas.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right about that. So, we need to take the technology we have available to us and leverage it. When we get giant repositories like this, we need to take it, we need to have a plan to digitize it and get it into a system that can help us understand what we&#x27;re really dealing with. Maybe this is some of the reasons why the Trump administration wants to move things forward because as AI advances, Mike, more and uh more and more closer to general uh artificial intelligence, which means consciousness, and we&#x27;re really close at this point. The truth is going to come out either way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Plus, now with the technology breakthroughs that we have with AI, we would need that to go through 80 plus years of information that the government&#x27;s been sitting on this entire time. &gt;&gt; That might have something to do with the announcement as well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know what? I look forward to everything.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s watch a bit more of this. We have 2 minutes more to go. Here we go, folks. &gt;&gt; We discussed the Swedish ghost rocket craze of the 1940s. [music] A swarm of at least 1,400 documented rocket and cigar-shaped UFOs [music] descending on Norway and Sweden, never landing on the ground, always [music] plunging into water.</p>
<p>A swarm that even caused the Swedish government to form a specialized [music] military unit and American President Eisenhower to send his top general James Dittle to investigate. [music] Claus von isn&#x27;t just an archivist. Wow. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s a field investigator in his own right. &gt;&gt; Again, folks, this is just coming out today.</p>
<p>Head over to YouTube, check out Jesse Michael&#x27;s video. This just sounds amazing. Let&#x27;s play more. &gt;&gt; Interviewing experiencers [music] and witnesses at the very center of UFO history. He spent a lot of time [music] with Betty Hill of the famous Barney and Betty Hill 19.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t forget the Obamas bought the rights to the story of Betty and Barney Barney Hill. They have a deal with Netflix to produce a movie on it. Goes along with the story. &gt;&gt; 61 abduction case in New Hampshire. Everybody knows about this canonical abduction story.</p>
<p>But Clauss dug a little deeper and found out that Betty outside of her abduction witnessed a UFO crash near her home. She even recovered the debris which she went on to bury [music] in her backyard where it still might be to this day. &gt;&gt; I usually say that we are standing at the very top of a mountain of knowledge today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But the mountain is resting on this mountain &gt;&gt; that is even bigger.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That is moving into the future. It says give me &gt;&gt; this episode is one of the hardest core summaries of evidence for UFOs I&#x27;ve ever heard. &gt;&gt; When you speak to other people, have you seen anything unnatural? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t want to talk about it. &gt;&gt; Hold on. That sounds like metal gaming &gt;&gt; complete. I looked up. I&#x27;m like, was that [laughter] Metal Gaming? &gt;&gt; Okay, let&#x27;s go back to this again and play Metal Gaming with someone who&#x27;s in the chat and he&#x27;s in the back a lot and I was just like, wait a minute.</p>
<p>As I was typing other stuff, getting things ready to this, typing to the chat, it sounded like him. Let&#x27;s play it again. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don&#x27;t want to talk about it. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve ever heard speak to other people. Have you seen anything unnatural? Yes.</p>
<p>Yes. But I Oh, I don&#x27;t want to talk about it. &gt;&gt; I brought my buddy Amar Candal [music] from Yes Theory to the archives and we had a blast. What is your top UFO photo? Without further ado, please enjoy this week&#x27;s Swedish alchemist, Clauss Swan, the coin 405. Are you out there? Join the back.</p>
<p>People can understand how close your voice sounds to this guy. We&#x27;d love to have you back again. We saw you there before the show heading over to Harolds. Come on, my friend. Jump in.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How is this possible? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amazing stuff, my friends. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s international. It&#x27;s not just the United States. It&#x27;s everywhere.</p>
<p>[music] &gt;&gt; But you know what we&#x27;re missing? We&#x27;re missing the information from India, from uh South Asia, from Asia itself. You know what I mean? And Andy, go ahead. Because you know what? It&#x27;s a world from Australia, from South America, from everywhere. Candy, go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Did Did I get that right? He was saying about Betty Hill had a previous or a a UFO sighting potentially where a crashed UFO and she collected some of or collected some of the &gt;&gt; the this object and buried it in a back garden. Has anybody ever heard that before? I&#x27;ve never heard that. &gt;&gt; No, not even well on mushrooms. [laughter] No, I haven&#x27;t heard it either. And &gt;&gt; nobody&#x27;s heard about that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, it just uh struck me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. Let&#x27;s go ahead. Well, we got 10 seconds left. Uh music, visual effects.</p>
<p>There you go, folks. Great production value coming from Jesse Michaels. They throw a lot into this and it&#x27;s like his shows, they usually go for two, three hours, don&#x27;t they? Uh uh Andy if even some foron in some examples &gt;&gt; I must &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s a long format of long format. &gt;&gt; I&#x27; I&#x27;ve never joined one of his shows. I&#x27;ve never viewed any of them to be honest.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I have. Yeah, you&#x27;re right, Thomas. He&#x27;s long format like Joe Rogan. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s similar.</p>
<p>Yeah, he goes hours with his interviews. He did that with uh the one he did with David Crush if you remember. &gt;&gt; Yep. [snorts] &gt;&gt; That was &gt;&gt; and even more lately some of the stuff that he&#x27;s been getting into has even been longer. And it just gives you all the details because you know what in a lot of these interviews they&#x27;ll go on for four or five hours, right? But they only give you an edited down piece to fit a time slot.</p>
<p>So, what we&#x27;re getting more really is the unedited conversation without all the quick cuts that go in to go ahead and make it into a piece like you&#x27;ll get for social media where as people are talking, there&#x27;s pauses, they all go away where it comes out as there&#x27;s people, there&#x27;s pauses, they&#x27;re all talking in it that way. And it&#x27;s just really changed the canour, more importantly, the believability of people. My god. Wow, Tim, you raised your hand. Living my friend, what&#x27;s up? &gt;&gt; Hey, Thomas.</p>
<p>Um, how&#x27;s it going? I just had some stuff I had to add to today&#x27;s topic. &gt;&gt; Please do. &gt;&gt; All right. So, um, you know, we&#x27;re all pretty excited, or at least I&#x27;m super excited now about the announcement coming from Trump. And so we know back on the 19th when he posted to True Social that he was directing the Secretary of State to go ahead and identify and release all of the records to related to quote alien and extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s pretty specific and we know that he can just disclose anything and declassify it just by saying out loud. So, I feel like that is fairly clear what that announcement is. And so, you know, that kind of leveled my interest up right there. Um, and then I wanted to get more into the timeline and I looked a little deeper into uh the UA the UK eupfologist filmmaker that actually disclosed this information, Mark Christopher Lee. And so, um, his [clears throat] claims of the information directly came from a Trump advisor, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s specifically pretty good information.</p>
<p>Um, if it&#x27;s, you know, the truth. And so, according to those reports that came through the Daily Mail, and this was back before 2026 that this interview took place, and then finally was released through outlets around February, right? So um this information was released to leave far before 20 2026 and um that source alleged that um the key details um that he&#x27;s um you know saying that this circle of intel uh is implying that there is existence of a speech of proposed timeline as you were kind of implying and the content of that suggest that the speech will address specific historical modern incidents including 1947 Roswell crash, 2004 USS Nimmit&#x27;s tic tac encounter and the 2015 gimbal and go fastest videos. And so the timing now we know initial spec speculation was revealing that it was going to be spoken about at the UN General Assembly and then um more recently pointed towards the July 86. If I can&#x27;t bring this forward, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; you know, these things that are being brought forward, I have to point out &gt;&gt; Steven Di uh &gt;&gt; Dier Der, how how you pronounce this? How would you pronounce that? Tim D &gt;&gt; Diner. Thank you.</p>
<p>Steven Diner, &gt;&gt; UAP un, you know, from the UAP unidentified alien podcast. He&#x27;s actually made some calls out about what&#x27;s going on. This isn&#x27;t the first one. This is the guy who&#x27;s actually getting in contact with the people. He was the one who brought out the story about Mark Christopher Lee first bringing all this out.</p>
<p>He was the guy who actually did it. He connected with Lee. He brought out the story. And this has gone like global at this point, &gt;&gt; right? And you say global and there are in fact global implications in connection with this timeline. And so now we know that specifics have been revealed, you know, that kind of do show some urgency to release all of this information in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know, Tim, it&#x27;s almost like the way I&#x27;ve always put it, humanity. Let&#x27;s just be clear. No, not humanity. The United States government ran into something a number of years ago. Coming out of that, we made a promise and signed something that said by this particular date, you&#x27;re going to do this shit and you&#x27;re going to make it known to everybody.</p>
<p>Otherwise, here&#x27;s the repercussions of what&#x27;s going to go. Now, coming out of this, if you agree to do this, we&#x27;re going to give you technology, all these different things. But by this state, you have to bring it out. And knowing humanity, knowing Washington, &gt;&gt; we we fucked it up. We didn&#x27;t meet the protocols.</p>
<p>We started seeing the implementation of and we were told, &quot;You didn&#x27;t do your shit.&quot; And now we&#x27;re moving forward with what we said we wouldn&#x27;t do if it did or shit, which caused our federal government potentially and more to go ahead and change what&#x27;s happening. What we&#x27;ve got now is we&#x27;re finally at the point, &gt;&gt; you know, um we had the UAPF during Trump. ARO came under Biden and Biden was different for whatever reason. the Democrat party and Biden&#x27;s administration shut all this stuff down, throwing the big fuck you to the to the non-human intelligence that potentially for the deals we made. So, we&#x27;re at a point now where we recognize it.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re seeing it. And maybe there&#x27;s some more information that we&#x27;re not privy to. That&#x27;s engaged Obama to go ahead and throw the pitch and Trump to go ahead and fucking hit the home run. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not coincidence.</p>
<p>Obama did not go ahead &gt;&gt; and and say what&#x27;s going on with this and say are aliens real you know aliens are real &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; those questions that Obama went through were completely scripted right &gt;&gt; I believe so too and I think the specifics that were released um you know through this report uh help to verify that because now we know that there are two agencies specifically going to be tasked for these files. Now, you&#x27;re going to get a mixed reaction from the audience when you hear that they&#x27;re tasking Arrow and the Pentagon. And so, that&#x27;s the sources that they&#x27;re going to be getting their alien information from. And so, that is pretty specific information. And they&#x27;re looking at national archives and records obviously uh and the intelligence community.</p>
<p>So there has been a proposed timeline and you know the fact is that timeline is available. You can source it yourself if you use the right uh Google. &gt;&gt; But is the timeline from us or is the timeline hate to say it of something we agreed to with a non-human intelligence? Um well it looked like the phase one is identification coming right now through spring of 2026 followed by review and redaction with the spring and summer of 2026 the ongoing phases the identific or I&#x27;m sorry the big reveal coming July 8th with that 2020 in 2026 with that big Roswell 79th anniversary speech coming from the president followed by rolling releases coming late 2026 and beyond. Now, the catch obviously um the president has the power to declassify anything yet. Um who knows if that means that we&#x27;re talking orbs craft radar or or what we&#x27;re actually physically going to get.</p>
<p>But I think the fact that we do see that there was a planned timeline &gt;&gt; Yeah. just shows us that this was something quick released &gt;&gt; outside of the scope of the norm and what what&#x27;s understood if we have the office of the if we have the executive branch right and as part of the executive branch you have the president all the people he appoints and everything that&#x27;s going on which changes out every four years potentially but then you have this other part of the executive branch that&#x27;s out there that ex uh extends and is enabled from administration administration that handles the deal with the non-human intelligence or protect or potentially the management of the information that regards to what we&#x27;re dealing with. &gt;&gt; Right. Well, I think the fact that they&#x27;re calling this a quote big reveal &gt;&gt; coming with this speech &gt;&gt; um may hint kind of at what that is all about. &gt;&gt; And I think that this audience definitely knows what that is because, you know, you&#x27;ve been talking about it for years.</p>
<p>Um but the [snorts] general public, this is news and I think to hear it from you know, a sitting president is a first and to have to support it. Um, I think this is a short timeline for, you know, for us to consider one year. Um, a that&#x27;s a pretty short timeline. Now, I hate to highlight the review and redaction portion coming through this spring and summer, but I think we knew that that was going to happen to a certain extent. Now how deep that redaction goes is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>But I kind of believe that [snorts] uh social media will keep this kind of honest because there will be an outcry if those redactions get too deep. And now we know X is not a great place to source information. But it&#x27;s definitely a place that even the news uh kind of goes to including people in government. It&#x27;s their first stop when they&#x27;re talking on this topic. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>Tim, if I can, I just got a reminder of time commitments that are going on. Uh, &gt;&gt; you got it. [clears throat and laughter] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Brian Pebble, your your hand is up, my friend, before we wrap this up. &gt;&gt; Yes, I&#x27;ll be brief.</p>
<p>I I thought that was great that Tim and Thomas. Um, two things. One, um, it&#x27;d be interesting to see if George Bush or Bill Clinton comes out with anything on this um, in the near future. Uh, that would be quite fascinating if somebody can ask them a question. on this topic.</p>
<p>Um, the other thing is is can they pry is there a legal way to pry non-human intelligence? Just the fact that biologics are out and about um, &gt;&gt; you know, you know what biologics give us, Brian? &gt;&gt; From the atomic energy act. Just really quick, biologics give us the opportunity to acknowledge there&#x27;s something here without actually admitting that there&#x27;s been a craft here that we&#x27;ve been taking and trying to re uh re-engineer. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s it&#x27;s a way out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It should not be covered under the Atomic Energy Act. &gt;&gt; Right. Bingo. &gt;&gt; And that way the president can get around it. &gt;&gt; Exactly, my friend.</p>
<p>Now, it may have been tied to the craft that had an energy system like that, but maybe they can go ahead and cover it up. But either way, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and thank everybody for coming out to this episode of Disclosure Tonight. One hell of a great time. Thanks everybody for being around for uh our episode today. Yeah, we&#x27;ll continue on Monday, see where it goes.</p>
<p>And yeah, we&#x27;re covering stuff from the United States, what&#x27;s going on with disclosure for around the world, but you know what? [music] We do deal with global politics. And today we had a insight on UK, we cover them, we cover Canada, we cover all all around the world, my friends. Um, [music] yeah, we&#x27;ve got scary things going on with Iran. So, on that, folks, I want to go ahead and appreciate uh thank [music] you for everybody coming out to this episode. More importantly, I want to go ahead and thank uh uh [music] Lord McCormack once, Lord McCormack twice.</p>
<p>Uh this is Liz and Brian Pebble for all your love and support [music] for what we do here. Mike, thanks for coming out to tonight&#x27;s episode. &gt;&gt; Oh, my pleasure. I want to miss it. It was a great episode tonight.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, god. [music] Yeah. got to have a great time. We do this live for you because you know what? We [music] try to go ahead and collect the best information we can about what&#x27;s going on in disclosure and presented in a way that&#x27;s in fun and informative and feels like [music] a community from people hanging out and talking about whether they&#x27;re on one side of this or the other. We [music] want to hear your thoughts on everybody, you know, that&#x27;s why we have the back chat open and it&#x27;s open for everybody, right, Mike? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like your [music] local hangout. Your local bar. &gt;&gt; Your local bar and grill. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everybody gets to come hang out and talk.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. On that point, I want to thank everybody for coming out to this this episode of Sclosure [music] Tonight. And as we say at the end of this show, eyes open, no fear. Be safe everybody, but &gt;&gt; go back to Party City where you belong.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. We&#x27;ll catch you in the flip side. Good night, everybody. Take care.</p>
