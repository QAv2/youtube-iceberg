            <p>this trick will help you remember calculus forever it came from Isaac Newton who believed there was really nothing special about a perfect circle every smooth curve when you zoom in enough looks just like a line This is similar to The Arc that forms when a rocket is launched to the naked eye from afar it looks curved due to the effect of gravity but the closer we get the straighter it becomes Newton said let&#x27;s zoom in the field of view as far as we can to a point that&#x27;s so small it&#x27;s smaller than anything you can name but not zero you&#x27;re looking at the ark not over a period of time but at a single moment what was almost a line becomes exactly a line the slope of this line is what we call the derivative if you swing a rock in a loop around your head and suddenly release it it&#x27;ll shoot off in a linear trajectory at a constant speed exactly in the direction that calculus says the rock is moving at the moment you let it go be sure to subscribe to learn more</p>
