            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>My whole life, I&#x27;ve been fascinated by the universe and what&#x27;s out there beyond Earth. It led me to obtain advanced degrees in astrophysics, aerospace engineering, and optical science. Then I got to work over the past three decades with NASA, the US Army, and the Department of Defense. Travis. &gt;&gt; Hey, Brandon.</p>
<p>How you doing? &gt;&gt; Brandon Fugal. &gt;&gt; Four years ago, I got the chance of a lifetime to join an amazing team in their investigation of the most bizarre place I&#x27;d ever heard of, Skinwalker Ranch. At first, I was skeptical of all the legends. But from day one, we&#x27;ve experienced things together that I thought were only possible in science fiction. &gt;&gt; What are you seeing? &gt;&gt; A signal.</p>
<p>Massive energy spikes that come out of nowhere. &gt;&gt; 1.6 600 0. &gt;&gt; Boy, that thing sounds like it&#x27;s hitting something hard. &gt;&gt; Evidence of a 400 ft long dome-shaped object buried inside a rocky messa. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;m up against something pretty hard right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Inexplicable animal deaths. There&#x27;s no sign of struggle. It&#x27;s just dead. &gt;&gt; And a ton of UAPs. &gt;&gt; Look, look, look.</p>
<p>What is that? &gt;&gt; Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. &gt;&gt; UAP right there. &gt;&gt; Yep. Recently, some documents were released to the public about a program run by the Pentagon known as UAPF, the unidentified aerial phenomena task force. It was created about four years ago for the study of UAPs and phenomena like what we&#x27;ve experienced on Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p>These documents also revealed that I was the chief scientist for the UAPF and I helped author the official report that was presented to Congress in 2021. However, I wasn&#x27;t permitted to disclose any of this to the team on the ranch. So now, as I&#x27;m returning to join them once again for what I consider to be the most critical investigation of the UAP phenomena in the world, I&#x27;m real eager to discuss what I can with them, and I&#x27;m curious what their response will be. There is a ranch in northern Utah. It is considered the epicenter of the strangest and most disturbing phenomena on Earth.</p>
<p>Animal mutilations, bizarre UFO sightings, and unusual energies that have proven harmful to humans. For 20 years, the federal government tried to find answers and failed. Now, a new team of dedicated scientists, researchers, and experts has taken over. They are determined to solve the mystery and reveal the secret of Skinwalker Ranch. Hey, Dragon.</p>
<p>This is uh Cameron. I have Brandon on board. We&#x27;re on the perimeter of Skinwalker Ranch. We&#x27;re inbound. &gt;&gt; Hey Cameron, we are ready for you guys.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m Brandon Fugal, the owner of Skinwalker Ranch. I&#x27;m really excited to pull together the team today. &gt;&gt; Every time that we enter the ranch, there are new discoveries and sometimes new dangers that arise. We&#x27;ve seen more evidence of the reality of the phenomena and we are committed to getting the answers. &gt;&gt; Here we come in for our landing at the Skinwalker Ranch helipad.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The revelation that Dr. Taylor had been acting as the chief scientist for the Pentagon&#x27;s UAP task force came as a shock to all of us. I think we&#x27;re still processing the reality of what that means. I found it to be intriguing. I found it to be confirmation that we are truly on to something.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; welcome back. Good to see you, friend. &gt;&gt; You, too. &gt;&gt; Hey, Caleb. &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s good to be back.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How are you? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re ready to kick off another phase of this investigation. It&#x27;s always good to see my good friend Brandon. We&#x27;re excited to get him up to date on what we&#x27;ve been doing. &gt;&gt; Is the team assembled? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Great.</p>
<p>Today we kick off the new research investigation this summer. I left last year being pretty disturbed about some of the things that I witnessed. And so I wonder, you know, what lies ahead and what crazy things are we going to experience this year? &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s proceed. We&#x27;ve got a a big day ahead of us and an exciting time to kick off this phase of the investigation. Great to have Dr.</p>
<p>Taylor back. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; We had some interesting surprises over the last weeks with Dr. Taylor, the former chief scientist for the Pentagon&#x27;s UAP task force. Uh it would be great to hear you shed some light on your role and how that has uh impacted our investigation and and how that may influence things moving forward.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sure. Uh well, so it started in a way that you&#x27;d be surprised actually. So that first summer back in 2019, I guess it was there were some uh signals that we had measured that I was concerned uh was a national security implication and it was this 1.6 GHz signal. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Eric, are you doing something at 1.6? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not broadcasting. Over the past three years, we&#x27;ve repeatedly detected an energy frequency measuring 1.6 GHz.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What hap what the heck is that? &gt;&gt; Which we&#x27;ve suspected could be some kind of communication signal. Now, normal human technology like cell phones and radios don&#x27;t typically operate at that frequency. So, with all the bizarre phenomena we&#x27;ve seen out here, I wonder who or what could be broadcasting that signal out here on the ranch. I went to the Pentagon to brief to find out if this was us doing it or if it was somebody else doing it. &gt;&gt; Foreign adversaries that may be involved with &gt;&gt; and I had so I had to report it to the right officials.</p>
<p>So I went to a room in the Pentagon and I uh I briefed uh what I&#x27;d seen and then this guy comes into the room and he asked everybody else but me to leave and he said, &quot;I&#x27;m the director of the UAP task force. this is very interesting and what I&#x27;d like to do is invite you to come on on board and be the chief scientist for the task force. And he presented me to both Congress and the White House as the chief scientist of the task force. And uh and it wasn&#x27;t until he and I both retired within the last 6 months and we were approved to re reveal that we actually were part of that that task force. &gt;&gt; Interesting.</p>
<p>Were they able to shed light on whether we&#x27;re dealing with a foreign adversary or the nature of what we&#x27;re recording here at Skinwalker Ranch? &gt;&gt; So, according to the charter written in the National Defense Authorization Act, they had to tell us if they were doing something. It turns out it&#x27;s not us. It&#x27;s not anybody that we know of. So, what is it? &gt;&gt; I know a lot of our team members have been really concerned that they weren&#x27;t actually privy to your role. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I was bound by an oath and legal uh requirements. I could not say it. If I would have said it, I&#x27;d gone to jail, &gt;&gt; right? I can tell you now that uh I&#x27;m in the private sector and I see this as a huge opportunity here that uh hopefully we&#x27;ll see assets come available for us. &gt;&gt; Well, it has to be reciprocal. I agree.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This has to be a give and take. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Especially when we&#x27;re dealing with such sensitive material. &gt;&gt; I agree. It was hard for me to keep information from everyone on the ranch because it&#x27;s critical that we act and feel like a team.</p>
<p>But I also completely understand why the government needed me to keep some things confidential. Thankfully, now that I&#x27;ve left the UAP task force, there will be no more need for secrets. I can say from my personal uh experience here and from uh what we&#x27;ve uh uncovered and investigated, this is a hot spot that uh everybody&#x27;s looking at and and they wish they had the access that we have on the daily basis to do the test and measurements. &gt;&gt; So, if I&#x27;m correct here, it was the work that you started doing here that led to your opportunity to be part of &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s coming from the guy that told us we were all nuts when we first invited say that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Just saying. I love it. &gt;&gt; Dr. Taylor&#x27;s involvement with the UAP task force. This is of course a revelation.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t really change my outlook on his contributions here, but I also welcome any insights that may have come out of his involvement with the UAP task force. &gt;&gt; So, Eric, what would you propose as far as experiments? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got a lot of planned activities. Um, some of them based in the work that we did the last time we were all together. One of the big findings of course was what was inside that mace out there. &gt;&gt; And what did we pull out? Metal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. It&#x27;s an aerospace style manufactured material, not something that happens naturally. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Last year, while drilling horizontally into the mesa, &gt;&gt; Wow, look at all the metal. We extracted pieces of metal from a massive dome-shaped object that the drill couldn&#x27;t penetrate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You did the analysis of the uh samples that we sent. &gt;&gt; Yes, we did. &gt;&gt; Ah. And when we had them analyzed at the University of Utah, we found out that they were composed of a mixture of elements that NASA used as a protective coating on the space shuttle. So, one of our main goals this year is to determine just what could be buried inside that mess.</p>
<p>I think one of the ways we get answers to the mesa is to do a different kind of survey and I&#x27;m thinking ground penetrating radar. So we have a GPR capability that we&#x27;re going to deploy this year which is going to allow us to kind of paint that whole area and see down into the ground and see if maybe there is a big a big void like we&#x27;ve had described to us. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Also, I want to continue expanding the effort out into the homestead, of course, but also we have this opportunity right out there at the Triangle. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Over the past 3 years, we&#x27;ve been perplexed by a zone about a mile above a place on the ranch we call the Triangle. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got liftoff. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. During launch, the electromagnetic spectrum is going crazy, guys. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve detected the 1.6 6 GHz signal there and we&#x27;ve seen rockets and lasers deflected by some invisible force or object. &gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m showing radar alimeter showing we&#x27;re only 40 ft above the ground right now. &gt;&gt; We also took Brandon&#x27;s helicopter up there to scan it and had a shadowy UAP fly back and forth about 40 ft below us. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; My gosh. And last year here, &gt;&gt; this thing&#x27;s really clipping along, huh? &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Can you replay that? &gt;&gt; We watched a UAP ascend from the mesa toward that mile high zone and then just vanish into thin air. &gt;&gt; Are we seeing portals open? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; Brandon&#x27;s not crazy to mention portals. People, including scientists, have reported seeing portals here for years. I just don&#x27;t know what to make of all that yet. There&#x27;s a level of anomalous phenomena happening over the triangle that somehow we need a better handle on.</p>
<p>That begs the question, then how do we follow up? &gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m contemplating a new experiment. You know, taking a a slam scanner, a LAR based device up into the air with the helicopter. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a good idea. You know, it would be nice to have a really good LAR measurement at altitude at 5,000 ft right over the center of the triangle. &gt;&gt; Could we do that with the helicopter? How heavy is this equipment? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s handheld.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a handheld LAR device. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Will open the doors and and fly around the perimeter of it, holding the LAR out the edge of the door and and mapping as we go around it. It takes its own GPS information, which will be interesting if it gets anomalous behavior from that. So, while members of the team are out there conducting these experiments, I think it would be smart to have Tom and Candace and Jim move out to the community in order to interview those who will bring additional information and experiences to light.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m actually finding the community uh willing to embrace us and I think a lot of it is because of the credibility that we bring to the table. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we are excited. We have a lot of leads in the community this year. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So that stigma is breaking down like we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve said and it it is easier to get people to to speak &gt;&gt; well for you, for Jim and you. Thank you for building those relationships. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. You bet.</p>
<p>Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you everyone for your continued hard work. We all have our marching orders. Let&#x27;s press onward. &gt;&gt; Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks, Brandon. &gt;&gt; Fantastic. Let&#x27;s get to work, guys. We got a lot to do. Hey fellas, finally meeting the great Pete Kelsey.</p>
<p>Thank you. &gt;&gt; After our first meeting, technologist Pete Kelsey arrived to help us with our first experiment of the year at the Triangle. Over the last couple of years, he&#x27;s brought in numerous scanning devices that have detected a lot of phenomena all across the ranch. &gt;&gt; So, what do we have here? &gt;&gt; That is the hover map. Um, basically handheld LAR.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to strap myself to your helicopter and see what we get. You saying you&#x27;re going to literally hang outside the helicopter and scan the space with this device. &gt;&gt; With your permission, of course. &gt;&gt; Okay. As Cameron Fugle flies me and Pete Kelsey up through the triangle, Pete will be strapped in and scanning the area with a LAR device.</p>
<p>It works by emitting infrared laser light that we hope will reveal anything that can&#x27;t be seen with the naked eye and might help explain all the UAPs and other phenomena we&#x27;ve detected up there. So that is the first part of our exercise today. There&#x27;s a second part. What&#x27;s that? &gt;&gt; Eric&#x27;s going to turn on a broadcast of the 1.6 GHz signal. Right.</p>
<p>Then when we get to 5,000 ft, these guys are going to launch a rocket from here. Now, it&#x27;s going to go up probably to about 1500 feet, no more than 2,000 ft. So, I feel comfortable with that. &gt;&gt; Now, isn&#x27;t aren&#x27;t rockets and broadcasting at 1.6 how you make things happen here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, the first part of our exercise today is an area on the eastern side of the property where we&#x27;ve seen anomalous data in our photoggramometry suggestive of something.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, Pete, you caught this with your first scan with the photoggramometry. Now, you get to go hover above it in the helicopter and see if you can catch it with your LAR. &gt;&gt; The East Field is a location about a half a mile from the triangle where some of the strangest things have happened during our investigation. &gt;&gt; Spinning up. Right at the end of last year, Pete conducted a photoggramometry scan in the east field near a mysterious circle of stones that sets up on the mesa.</p>
<p>According to Navajo historian John Dover, ancient indigenous people created the feature to represent a portal on Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Okay. &gt;&gt; In the sky. Oh, right there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, weird. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, what Pete scanner detected just blew us away. &gt;&gt; Look at this structure.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s nuts. &gt;&gt; Well, just think about what it would mean if we saw the same kind of anomaly with two completely different technologies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s go ahead and uh commence the experiment. &gt;&gt; What all goes? &gt;&gt; Everything.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s generally true in science that we place the highest confidence in results that repeat themselves. So, as we survey just over the east field here and in the vicinity of the triangle. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You bet.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We want to understand whether we&#x27;re dealing with a persistent effect in those two regions of the ranch because we have no idea. &gt;&gt; All right, so let&#x27;s figure out what hard point we want to snap to. Let&#x27;s go around to that. &gt;&gt; While Pete scans with his LAR device out the open door of the helicopter, I&#x27;ll be right beside him watching the monitor to see if the LAR picks up any structure or objects. &gt;&gt; Let me have that rocket motor and that igniter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dragon, Caleb, and Thomas will be on the ready to launch rockets. They&#x27;ll also be broadcasting the 1.6 GHz communication signal that we&#x27;ve recorded in the past. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, we&#x27;re all set up in here, right? &gt;&gt; Which Eric and Brandon will be monitoring on his systems during the experiment. Both of these tools have been very effective in stimulating bizarre activity on the ranch in the past.</p>
<p>So hopefully by the end of today, we&#x27;ll get some answers about these locations. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, uh we&#x27;re ready to go in the chopper. All right, copy that. You guys be careful up there. We don&#x27;t want to lose Pete.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got him tied in with four different ways. Everything&#x27;s checked this year. The first experiment we&#x27;re going to try involves having one of our experts hanging out of a helicopter. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen, but this is a pretty dangerous experiment, and I hope it yields some results. Here we go.</p>
<p>Hang on, Pete. First, go hit the east field. Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; There we go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now, we&#x27;re tracking. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll be able to capture something interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Every time Pete&#x27;s been out here, something interesting has happened. &gt;&gt; Well, this will be good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Activity is unpredictable at Skinwalker Ranch, but we&#x27;ve found that there are certain methods that you can utilize in order to stimulate response. This very aggressive experiment is an important part of this stage of the investigation, and we are committed to getting the answers. Bryant, I just turned it on. Will you radio Eric and see if they&#x27;re seeing it? Eric, &gt;&gt; Thomas has just turned on the 1.6. Just confirming if you can see that signal or not.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve got good signal. &gt;&gt; Terrific. &gt;&gt; Well, we&#x27;re broadcasting the 1.6, so we&#x27;ll see if that causes any reaction. All right, the east field. We should be about over right in here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. I&#x27;m going to start scanning. All right. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Nice and easy, Cameron. &gt;&gt; All right. We&#x27;re going. I see the ground.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re getting buffet in from the wind a little bit, &gt;&gt; but there&#x27;s no freaking wind. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re getting our asses kicked. &gt;&gt; Something pushed the helicopter away. &gt;&gt; Well, the weird thing is it says there&#x27;s no wind data. Feel that? That&#x27;s just crazy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. We&#x27;re getting something. What? We are getting an anomaly in the air right now. Right there. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re kidding.</p>
<p>No, I am not kidding. We&#x27;re getting a significant anomaly in the air right now. &gt;&gt; It was clearly an anomaly floating in the sky. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve been following them. &gt;&gt; I know.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t see anything either. &gt;&gt; The helicopter is getting buffeted out of the way like there&#x27;s a vortex or something here. Yeah, we got significant buffeting right here. &gt;&gt; This is crazy. &gt;&gt; Right where we obtained photoggramometry images of a mysterious column-shaped anomaly above the east field one year ago.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There are some very interesting artifacts showing up. &gt;&gt; WA Pete Kelsey&#x27;s LAR scanner, which emits infrared light, detected an image of something about 300 ft up in the air. And what was even crazier was that some kind of invisible force was literally pushing Brandon&#x27;s helicopter around in midair. &gt;&gt; Feel that? That&#x27;s just crazy. &gt;&gt; It looks like it&#x27;s being pushed around from the ground right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re getting pushed around. You can see the helicopter out like rocking and I&#x27;m picking up nothing just visually. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s moving us more than it should just by these winds. What the hell is going on? &gt;&gt; You see how he&#x27;s moving? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. You can see. Look at that. &gt;&gt; Feels like there&#x27;s a vortex. Significant turbulence in that spot.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The helicopter definitely looks like it&#x27;s rocking around down here. &gt;&gt; Making me a little uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to come over here to the north just a little bit. &gt;&gt; The outside wind speeds that registered on the helicopter&#x27;s instruments were totally insignificant. It was just this strange invisible force that we couldn&#x27;t see pushing us around.</p>
<p>I have no scientific explanation for it. I just know it&#x27;s where we saw a column-shaped anomaly above the stone circle last year and now an object of some kind on the LAR readout. &gt;&gt; I think we&#x27;re good. We&#x27;ve got a really nice 3D map of the entire area. Cameron, I think we&#x27;re good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I say we fly right by the triangle. &gt;&gt; Yep. See, this is nothing right there. There&#x27;s just something wacky.</p>
<p>That is weird. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s much smoother right here. It shouldn&#x27;t be that. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s unusually turbulent for what uh the conditions are right over in that site. &gt;&gt; I couldn&#x27;t believe what had happened to us over the east field and the preliminary data we got on Pete&#x27;s LAR scanner.</p>
<p>It still needed to be processed, but based on our experience so far, we were really anxious about what we might find above the triangle. I mean, we&#x27;re at the triangle right now. So, &gt;&gt; all right. So, bring it up. &gt;&gt; Give me about 10 seconds and we&#x27;ll be scanning.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Uh, it&#x27;s running. It says, &gt;&gt; are you seeing data then? &gt;&gt; Nothing yet. &gt;&gt; Holy cow. There is something right outside the aircraft. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re kidding.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, I am not kidding. You were at 300 ft and we&#x27;re detecting an object in the air. What? &gt;&gt; Command center. We&#x27;re getting data. We&#x27;re getting data.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Copy you, Cameron. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me. about 300 ft above ground level. You can see the green is the ground, the red is the thing. &gt;&gt; This is unbelievable.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; In the past, all the phenomena we detected above the triangle has been nearly a mile up in the air. But as soon as Pete started scanning with the LAR, he detected something strange beginning at an altitude of just about 300 ft. We had never seen anything at the triangle that close to the ground before. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re climbing.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know why, but I feel really nervous about this. &gt;&gt; So, we got active data coming back showing an anomaly above the triangle &gt;&gt; right as we&#x27;re circling. It was easily distinguished from the ground. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s It froze up, Pete. It&#x27;s checking something.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m scanning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it&#x27;s telling me that it&#x27;s checking. It&#x27;s not writing any more data. &gt;&gt; All right, stand by.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to increase altitude. So, am I getting anything else? &gt;&gt; No, it says it&#x27;s disconnected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which is odd. Disconnected.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Wow, that&#x27;s weird. &gt;&gt; Hey, well, that your GPS is off from your pressure. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Sure.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re we&#x27;re we&#x27;re getting discrepancies right now. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve got electromagnetic interference on my heading. Command center. Uh, this is Cameron &gt;&gt; Center. How do you hear? This is Cameron.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, the ground went away. It was green and now the ground&#x27;s turned red. And, uh, the anomaly above it is is still red. So, I think we need to set down and reset this thing. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. I&#x27;m going to stop scanning. &gt;&gt; Command center. Uh, this camera. Command center.</p>
<p>Whoa. &gt;&gt; Command center helicopter. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we got a downdraft. Whoa.</p>
<p>Hold on. Wow. Wow. Wow. &gt;&gt; Why&#x27; they land in the field? &gt;&gt; Radio him.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Travis, do you copy? Hey, Eric. Do you copy inside the command center? &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. What&#x27;s up? &gt;&gt; I reach out to Cameron. They ended up landing out in the field for some odd reason. &gt;&gt; In the field, Travis, &gt;&gt; what happened? Travis, &gt;&gt; we were at 300 ft and were detecting an object in the air.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re preset. We&#x27;re about to relaunch and go do it again. &gt;&gt; Copy that. We&#x27;ll keep our eyes on you as well. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to circle back toward the ranch house.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And then we&#x27;ll come back to the triangle. &gt;&gt; Understood. After we finished our LAR scan above the east field, we were eager to head southwest to the triangle. &gt;&gt; All right, I&#x27;m going to start scanning.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Just let me know when you got data. &gt;&gt; Get data right now. There is something right outside the aircraft. As soon as we approached the triangle, we started detecting some kind of anomaly again right around 300 ft high. I was getting really anxious about what was going to happen next.</p>
<p>So, it start spiraling up, Cameron. Okay. &gt;&gt; Going to start spiraling up toward that 5,000 foot over the triangle. &gt;&gt; Copy you, Cameron. Holy cow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; You see it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got an anomaly. A clear anomaly right beside us. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve had eyes on it with three of binoculars and we&#x27;ve seen nothing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Are we at 5,000 ft? &gt;&gt; Just about. We&#x27;re almost there. &gt;&gt; Advance center. We are now at 5,000 ft AGL 10,000 ft above sea level. We are on point of the triangle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Tell them to launch. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, launch. You&#x27;re good to launch. &gt;&gt; Right as we reached the mile high zone, this huge mass showed up on the LAR. And with the 1.6 GHz signal being broadcast, it was time to launch a rocket and poke this nest as hard as we could.</p>
<p>3 2 1. There it goes. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s insane. &gt;&gt; See the wind direction? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It appears that the winds are tracking in front of us as I circle around.</p>
<p>So, the winds were out of the west, now they&#x27;re out of the north. It seems like we&#x27;re in a vortex, &gt;&gt; which is what we&#x27;ve seen before. Cameron, right here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is crazy. &gt;&gt; Command center.</p>
<p>Uh, this is Cameron. Be advised, I&#x27;ve got a vortex wind reading. So, these winds now are coming out of the east. They were coming out of the west really strong at 30 knots. He seemed to be moving in a counterclockwise rotation over the ranch.</p>
<p>Now &gt;&gt; hold on. The winds make no sense. They go from 40 knots down to seven in a different direction. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve never seen that before. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s moving us more than it should. Nothing&#x27;s consistent. The winds are coming from all directions. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we got a downdraft right there. &gt;&gt; Nice kick there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. As we approached the mile high zone above the triangle where we saw a UAP literally disappear one year ago, really strange winds started encircling the helicopter like a vortex. It really made me nervous about what the hell we were flying into. I think it&#x27;s time to command &gt;&gt; center.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just descending back down now. We&#x27;re going to land at the helipad. &gt;&gt; Copy you, Cameron. We will clear the helellipad. It&#x27;s exciting to see that we&#x27;re getting interesting returns in real time over the east field and over the triangle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Holy crap. &gt;&gt; I really want to know, are these real features that we&#x27;re seeing? &gt;&gt; Shake my hand. Heck yeah. Wow, you guys. Y&#x27;all are not going to believe that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, Pete&#x27;s face has me thinking that you guys caught something amazing. &gt;&gt; What did you see? There is an anomaly that this LAR picked up in midair three or 4 hundred feet above the ground. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s impossible. It&#x27;s impossible. &gt;&gt; It remained there, too.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what it wasn&#x27;t a quick blip. As we circled and made orbit, it it remained. Let&#x27;s process the data as soon as possible. Cameron and I want a full report at earliest convenience. All right.</p>
<p>Well, we got to go crunch some data. &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. Okay. Pick up. Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go, guys. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s get on that data. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want to take this harness off. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, guys, we&#x27;ve got Brandon and Cameron and Pete on the line for video call. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, Brandon. &gt;&gt; Hey, Gre. It&#x27;s good to be with you. &gt;&gt; Pete, Kelsey spent two days processing all the LAR data we collected above the Eastfield and the triangle. So, we couldn&#x27;t wait to review it with him and Brandon.</p>
<p>We needed to figure out what we had encountered up there that had affected the helicopter&#x27;s flight and control so dramatically. &gt;&gt; This is the data from the helicopter flight. &gt;&gt; So here we are over the east field. &gt;&gt; What you&#x27;re seeing the the icon of course is us. The magenta line is our trajectory.</p>
<p>That is the direction we&#x27;re flying. &gt;&gt; And we can see that the data is following the the aircraft. There&#x27;s something about it that was Oh, and right there it did. See how it&#x27;s doing these zigzag jumps? Something moved the helicopter. It It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>I mean, we we were all like, &quot;Whoa, what was that?&quot; &gt;&gt; It wasn&#x27;t just left and right oscillations. It was forward and aft, left and right, all almost simultaneous. It was if we had two magnets next to each other repelling each other. Whatever it was was trying to push us off. &gt;&gt; You know, I think that has to mean something.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. Now, I&#x27;ll call your attention to you. We have anomalous data in the same general area. &gt;&gt; So, here we are over the east field. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is right where I had the interference with the helicopter as well, isn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; And and there&#x27;s where I said, &quot;You know what? We&#x27;ve got an anomaly in a spot again.&quot; This red feature, &gt;&gt; that red feature floating in midair &gt;&gt; above and there&#x27;s no trail to it. be advised I should disclose some issues with this first scan. This is the incredibly frustrating part. I&#x27;ve spoken with a vendor. I mean, we&#x27;ve gone through it at length.</p>
<p>The vendor looked at this and went, &quot;Ah, you&#x27;re ghosting.&quot; And ghosting is just scanner picking up probably my feet, the skid. &gt;&gt; Well, I would just expect consistency. You know, if you&#x27;re picking up returns from the blades above or the skid below, then I would expect to see that through the whole thing. But the fact that you&#x27;re only seeing it over one point. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What is it about this branch that continues to throw us off? &gt;&gt; It was really sobering to all of us to hear from Pete Kelsey that the LAR data might not have been accurate, but there were certain things about it that just couldn&#x27;t be explained away. &gt;&gt; Pete, go forward. Let me I&#x27;ll tell you when to stop. Go forward. about right there.</p>
<p>Right there. Stop. Now, when you look at that, this is right dead center over where the column was there in your photoggramometry data. And and if you look, there&#x27;s no pathway to it. It&#x27;s not anomalous features until that spot.</p>
<p>Wow. In the exact same spot where we identified the column-like anomaly one year ago, we now have a second kind of scanning technology that seems to be detecting something strange again. If you can back up two frames, Pete, you stop. Perfect. Look at that.</p>
<p>I I I&#x27;m going to go to the screen. So, come on, guys. We&#x27;ve got some kind of wing like features. I mean, you look at that. There&#x27;s threedimensional detail here.</p>
<p>There was nothing there. We flew a helicopter around. We wouldn&#x27;t fly that close to an object like that. This distance right here from there to there is probably 10 m. It look at it.</p>
<p>It tends to have a shape to it. &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. That&#x27;s actually pretty distinct. &gt;&gt; That is compelling. &gt;&gt; Now, if we were standing in the road of the driveway looking north and we took Pete&#x27;s photoggramometry data and overlaid it on this image, you would see the pillar come up just like this.</p>
<p>right where this spot is. Wow. In the same spot where we detected a column-shaped anomaly last year, our LAR experiment may have also identified something strange. And this is right near a location on top of the mesa where ancient indigenous people built a stone monument that&#x27;s meant to represent a portal on Skinwalker Ranch. What could that be? &gt;&gt; We don&#x27;t know what it is, but there&#x27;s something that was anomalous about that spot.</p>
<p>And we got it on multiple sensors now. At least two. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m sitting here just stunned because I mean, no matter what, we&#x27;re dealing with something that is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And that it&#x27;s only over the east field. Oh, it happened at the triangle, too.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, guys. What I&#x27;m going to bring up now is the data at the triangle. &gt;&gt; Yep. There is what appears to be ghosting along the trajectory that we actually flew. &gt;&gt; But why so many in the one spot as we&#x27;re uh circling around the triangle? &gt;&gt; Well, again, I would expect if you&#x27;re seeing uh returns from either the the blades above or the the skid below that it would be consistent through the whole flight.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s the weird part. Why is it not? &gt;&gt; So, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m with you. I mean, there&#x27;s no trajectory line where this first showed up. You see that? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; To cut to the chase, I don&#x27;t think this is 100% conclusive in either direction.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I I agree with that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s so frustrating because it seems like we&#x27;re so close to understanding what we are dealing with. We&#x27;re seeing these things appearing that have no conventional explanation. It It&#x27;s so damn elusive.</p>
<p>If there&#x27;s any way we can we can execute on another experiment in rapid succession to this to to seize this moment and get some answers, I say go for it. &gt;&gt; Well, uh, first and foremost, Pete and Cameron, two of you may recall, but if I recall, I think we were about, uh, 300 400 ft or something like that, right? &gt;&gt; Seems about right. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something new here. you know, uh some of the interesting returns were happening at much lower altitudes than uh we&#x27;ve uh &gt;&gt; 4,000 ft or more lower. Right? During previous experiments at the triangle, it seemed that different phenomena occurred about 5,000 ft high.</p>
<p>But now, if the LAR data is correct, it appears that something is going on between 300 ft and that zone. &gt;&gt; You see that? &gt;&gt; Dude, you see it bend, dude? Did you see that? Last year, we were stunned to see lasers projected up through the triangle mysteriously bend. There it goes. &gt;&gt; There it goes. &gt;&gt; And rockets that we launched up there get completely deflected off target by something we couldn&#x27;t see.</p>
<p>And those things did happen at various altitudes. &gt;&gt; What was that bend all about? &gt;&gt; So, could that mean the anomalous zone is shifting along a vertical plane between 300 and 5,000 ft? Or does it mean that it may cover the entire space? At this point, we don&#x27;t know if we can trust the LAR data. So, we&#x27;re going to have to find another way to verify what we found at both the triangle and the east field. We really need to look over the triangle area at, you know, 400 ft if we or so. &gt;&gt; So, how do you envision that being done? &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, you could get a a swarm of drones because they all fly on GPS coordinates.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I like it. &gt;&gt; And fly them in a grid pattern and fly them around out there and see what happens. And you know way we&#x27;ve seen GPS messed up. Who knows what it would do. You know these people probably go people that do these drone swarms for like light shows and stuff.</p>
<p>They probably they are precise and the patterns do all these geometric shapes. You get them out here and fly them over the triangle with the GPS me. No tellings what you would see. &gt;&gt; No pumping the brakes at this point. Let&#x27;s just go full speed ahead.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s do it. Let&#x27;s move forward. &gt;&gt; Yeah, let&#x27;s go. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something odd going on at this ranch. I want to know the answer to so many things.</p>
<p>just what in the world is going on here? &gt;&gt; Every time we begin this work, I never know what to expect. And I&#x27;ve been surprised, if not shocked, by the outcome of each of our aggressive experiments. This year, we have some things in mind that might also be considered aggressive, but also visionary and quite different from what we&#x27;ve done before. Coming into this investigation, we had such little information, but now it&#x27;s coming to light that so many different government entities were so interested in this place. It makes me feel like we&#x27;re truly onto something and all eyes are watching us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; My hope is to find answers, gain new insights, to be able to understand the nature of what we are dealing with at the ranch. The deeper down the rabbit hole that we travel, the more complex that it appears. There are no easy answers at Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; I really don&#x27;t know what to expect here at the ranch. &gt;&gt; Hey, we got a light that&#x27;s moving.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There is right there. &gt;&gt; That looks like a bonafide UFO to me. &gt;&gt; There is something metallic in the Mesa. &gt;&gt; Whatever this is is as tall as the Mesa. We should be digging, drilling right there.</p>
<p>The closer that we are getting to the answers, the more covert military activity. &gt;&gt; We have a helicopter right over the triangle. &gt;&gt; It just went dark. It was a Blackhawk helicopter. &gt;&gt; Somebody&#x27;s up on the ridge &gt;&gt; right there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We seem to be poking the hornets&#x27;s nest like never before. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a heat source right above them. You feel like this may be a dangerous area to be working in. &gt;&gt; Very. &gt;&gt; The coyotes didn&#x27;t kill this animal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Middle of the day, an orb like that showing up. That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; This is the largest scale experiment that we&#x27;ve ever done here so far. &gt;&gt; Fire. We got a malfunction.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s something in the sky above the rocket. We may be looking at the anomaly for the first time, guys. &gt;&gt; There is definitely something here on Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. We&#x27;ve been wanting to fly a pattern of drones over the triangle and in the east field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Are several drones out of line. We can see from our perspective, &gt;&gt; they are clearly out of place. Yeah, we&#x27;ve got eyes on that. &gt;&gt; I have 80 disconnected. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re coming home.</p>
<p>Three, two, one. We got something right there. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a thing hovering over the launch site. &gt;&gt; So, there&#x27;s a gap in the data from that triangle at the top of the maze dot. &gt;&gt; Somehow, we&#x27;ve got to get inside the mesa.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There is a ranch in northern Utah. It is considered the epicenter of the strangest and most disturbing phenomena on Earth. Animal mutilations. bizarre UFO sightings and unusual energies that have proven harmful to humans. For 20 years, the federal government tried to find answers and failed.</p>
<p>Now, a new team of dedicated scientists, researchers, and experts has taken over. They are determined to solve the mystery and reveal the secret of Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; Pete. &gt;&gt; Hey, Pete. Want you to meet some friends of mine.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. After our experiment at the triangle last week actually revealed that there might be a connection to the mesa, we invited Pete Kelsey and his colleague, ground penetrating radar expert Yan Frank to help us with a new investigation of that area. &gt;&gt; Well, welcome to the ranch. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Happy to be here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, uh, Pete tells us that you&#x27;ve got some interesting technology that might help us out. That&#x27;s amazing. Yeah, I make deep ground penetrating radar systems and I&#x27;ve got one that I made for you guys that&#x27;s a really really small one so we can get up over some of that really rough rocks rock face that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to drag a normal radar on. And I&#x27;ve got one that&#x27;s a really deep penetrating groundbased system that looks like a snake actually. We use this for the mining industry.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. What is it you&#x27;re actually expecting to see? What are you looking for here? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve heard about caves inside of the mesa. &gt;&gt; Okay. We&#x27;re actually looking for also a structure that was impenetrable to our to our drilling. You know, as we went back into that messa, we were using a directional drilling technique that should have been able to turn upward, but could not.</p>
<p>We couldn&#x27;t get through that layer. So, there&#x27;s a dome shape there. And of course, we&#x27;ll be especially interested if we see anything that looks unnatural. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Beneath that surface.</p>
<p>In our ongoing efforts to find the answers behind all the strange phenomena that occur on Skinwalker Ranch, we&#x27;re now getting focused back on the mesa. Oh wow, look at that. We were all baffled one week ago when the drone swarm we launched over the triangle to pinpoint an anomaly between 300 and 5,000 ft began malfunctioning. &gt;&gt; One following. One&#x27;s falling.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE GOES CRAZY. Almost all of them disconnected right now. &gt;&gt; What I&#x27;m going to bring up now is the data from the terrestrial laser scanner. &gt;&gt; And then the LAR data that Pete recorded was missing a big chunk of data that somehow appeared right over that same spot where we drilled into the mesa last year and discovered a 400 ft long dome-shaped metal object. Wow.</p>
<p>a metal object made of the same kind of material that NASA uses to protect the outside of space shuttles. So now we&#x27;re hoping that Yan, who is a world-renowned expert in ground penetrating radar, has a technology that can help us figure out just what&#x27;s inside the mesa and how it might be related to the strange things that keep happening at the triangle. &gt;&gt; So how deep of penetration can you get? Usually we get down to 200 300 feet with this. So it&#x27;s pretty exciting. &gt;&gt; GPR works by sending radio waves into the ground.</p>
<p>They reflect off anomalies like buried objects or voids to reveal an image of their shape as well as their depth. &gt;&gt; If there&#x27;s a discontinuity or a void, we definitely should be able to see that. &gt;&gt; What about metal? &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, metal is a a great target for radar. So if there&#x27;s something metal there, we&#x27;d certainly be able to see that as well. &gt;&gt; Sounds like we&#x27;ve got a lot to do.</p>
<p>We should probably get to it. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s do it. All right, we&#x27;ll see y&#x27;all. Y&#x27;all just follow us down there. Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Even before we discovered this mysterious metal object, there were all kinds of rumors about the mesa going back to when Robert Bigalow and the federal government investigated here from the 1990s to the early 2000s. &gt;&gt; X marks a spot, Pete. &gt;&gt; X marks a spot. I&#x27;ve heard all kinds of crazy stories about this messa. Spacecraft going in it, tunnels, caverns, underground bases.</p>
<p>What kind of mysteries lie inside? For decades, there have been reports of underground chambers or tunnels beneath the mesa that may hold the key to understanding the secrets of Skinwalker Ranch. The deeper we can see into that pile of rocks, into that messa, uh, the more we&#x27;re going to understand what it is we&#x27;re messing with out here. &gt;&gt; Okay. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see what&#x27;s underground. So, that&#x27;s the antenna.</p>
<p>Well, that&#x27;s the entire radar. These are the antennas right here. This is just a separator. It&#x27;s all fiberglass. Keep it as light as possible.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t use carbon fiber cuz it&#x27;s conductive, of course. Giannis brought two devices that we&#x27;ll use to scan the mesa. One is a unit that Tom Winterton will actually wear while he hikes over the area where we drilled against the dome-shaped object last year. And meanwhile, Yan and Caleb will run the other device back and forth on top of the mesa to see if anything else might be hidden inside there like we&#x27;ve heard about in the past. Well, it looks like we&#x27;re just about set up.</p>
<p>So, uh, talk us through what you&#x27;re going to do. &gt;&gt; We got a couple of GPR systems here. So, this one here, what&#x27;s really nice about it, it&#x27;s a very long wavelength, which means we&#x27;re going to get good penetration. And because it&#x27;s handheld, it gives us uh the ability to get into areas that are really difficult terrain. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re set up over here. We&#x27;re going to be doing the usual data logging. We&#x27;ve got the SDR. We&#x27;ve got the uh geer counter running. &gt;&gt; All right, man.</p>
<p>Well, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get going. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good. &gt;&gt; With all that we have going on, and to the extent possible, I&#x27;m keeping a close eye on the RF spectrum analyzer to see if any unusual signals show up. Are you centered on 45? &gt;&gt; That would be 44.5 something.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Good enough. &gt;&gt; Nearly every time we run experiments on the ranch, we detect mysterious energy spikes, especially one measuring 1.6 GHz, which I think could be some kind of communication signal. &gt;&gt; Go ahead and turn it on. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve turned it on. Okay.</p>
<p>Got a transmitter and receiver working right now. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And it creates its own little website. It&#x27;s like a little access point. So, even though we&#x27;re not on the internet here, I&#x27;m going to talk to it with my phone.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And you are good. Um Um Are you guys transmitting something? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. Hey, Eric, Travis, are you guys transmitting something? &gt;&gt; No, we&#x27;re not transmitting at all.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What are you seeing? Uh uh I&#x27;ve never seen this signal before. Uh what the hell? This waveform is not supposed to be happening right now. &gt;&gt; Where&#x27;s it coming from? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. Where&#x27;s it coming from? Let&#x27;s Let&#x27;s way back from the truck here just to be absolutely certain. Uh okay.</p>
<p>Do you have a cell phone on you or something? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean I got one in my back pocket. &gt;&gt; Just take that out if you don&#x27;t mind. &gt;&gt; Turn it off. &gt;&gt; Here, I&#x27;ll turn it off. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, &gt;&gt; that ain&#x27;t it. What the hell? See, so that&#x27;s a normal waveform there just for a second, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I see it. Y it&#x27;s freaking out. &gt;&gt; Yan actually built the systems he brought out here. He understands them completely.</p>
<p>He is the guy for ground penetrating radar. As soon as we got one of his systems off the truck and turned it on, it was instantly detecting a signal that Jan had never seen before. In thousands of experiments using this device, he was baffled and confused. I find that really interesting. &gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;ve not seen that before? &gt;&gt; Uh, no, actually, uh, I have not &gt;&gt; and I tested it this morning.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m gonna go scroll through the spectrum analy. &gt;&gt; I tested it this morning and it was working. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s a little strange. Um, there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it. I think we&#x27;re just going to run with it and see if we can filter it out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Understood. &gt;&gt; When I first came on this ranch, I just thought, look, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of hype around it and I&#x27;m sure everything can be explained, right? And then weird things started happening. I I had that weird interference that just has no simple geological explanation. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to start recording this. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;m going to head up the mesa. So, &gt;&gt; careful. &gt;&gt; Having pulled metal uh 400 ft inside the mesa and now strongly suspecting that there could have actually been a cavern that went deep into the mesa. I&#x27;m praying that the information that we get from this GPR is finally going to answer some of the questions we have as far as what was this object we were bumping up against with the drill last year. &gt;&gt; Man, he&#x27;s up there.</p>
<p>Look at him. What you&#x27;re going to do for me is drag this and it doesn&#x27;t have to be a straight line cuz we&#x27;re tracking exactly where you are at all times, right? And uh this is going to be taking an image of the ground essentially. It&#x27;s a representation of what&#x27;s underground. So one&#x27;s a transmitter, one&#x27;s a receiver, and it&#x27;s going to stretch out behind you about 5 six mters. Okay, as Thomas is going up the mesa there, I&#x27;ve been tasked with escorting Yan.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s got a very powerful GPR system that&#x27;s been used all over the world. &gt;&gt; So, this is a very deep penetrating radar. In fact, it&#x27;s probably the world&#x27;s deepest GPR system. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m excited to see what kind of results we get, and I&#x27;m here to help him out with scanning as much as we can. &gt;&gt; All right, let&#x27;s hope the GPS works.</p>
<p>There are so many questions I have about Skinwalker Ranch. I want to know the answer to so many things. If I had to pick one that I wanted the answer to like right now, it would be what&#x27;s inside the mesa. We&#x27;re just going to have to see what we get. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s going on guys? &gt;&gt; So, what you got here? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m really interested in what you found, Yan.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I can&#x27;t wait. The day after we ran ground penetrating radar scans over the spot on the mesa where we discovered the massive dome-shaped metal object last year and also up on top of the ridge of the mesa. Pete Kelsey and Yan Frank joined us to present the process data of what they had found.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll start off with the uh the small lightweight one. &gt;&gt; This is the this is my walking path. &gt;&gt; This is your path. Yes. Now, do you recall when we were out in the field, we were getting a lot of interference.</p>
<p>Mhm. I&#x27;ve not seen that before. The data is almost unusable. There&#x27;s just a huge amount of interference in this area. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>Interference from what? &gt;&gt; Yes. What usually good GPR data looks like a slightly textured surface that might show subtle waves that represent natural ground features. So any stark changes or bizarre shapes that stand out could be things that aren&#x27;t natural like voids or objects. But most of the GPR data that Thomas got over the drill site was a checkered mess of strange shapes that didn&#x27;t make any sense, which Yan believed were caused by the mysterious interference that his device detected even before we ran his scans. So, we were all at a loss as to what the interference could have been caused by.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Could this signal be coming from the ground? &gt;&gt; It could be coming from anywhere. We don&#x27;t know, right? It is something that&#x27;s strong enough to overwhelm the radar. &gt;&gt; What exactly is responsible for this interference? I can&#x27;t help but wonder, is there something actually within the mesa generating radio frequency signals that could be causing interference? &gt;&gt; What would be the cause of this kind of interference? Do you think it&#x27;s an environmental thing? &gt;&gt; Well, the weird part is it works now when I take it away from the ranch. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I was going to ask you. &gt;&gt; I know you were going to ask.</p>
<p>wanted to know if we could do a controlled and it sounds like you&#x27;ve already done it. &gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t replicate it. &gt;&gt; That is such a that is such an interesting observation. &gt;&gt; We can actually recover a little bit of the data. Literally like 10% of it.</p>
<p>Okay. &gt;&gt; 10% of this data is used &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve detected a number of weird frequencies and signals during our experiments on the ranch, but never like the one that interfered with Yan&#x27;s GPR machines. And hearing that he was only able to recover 10% of what was recorded on the mesa made us all pretty nervous that we wouldn&#x27;t get any new information about just what may be buried inside there. What we can make out of that remaining 10%.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m trying to see if there are any hyperbolic shapes or things that look like horseshoes that would indicate that that could be a void or something discrete in the ground. &gt;&gt; And where do you see something like that? Well, there&#x27;s subtle hints of things that pop out like here. There&#x27;s another one here. There&#x27;s quite a few of them that are just scattered around. So, what that tells us are there&#x27;s a series of discrete anomalies.</p>
<p>These are something that&#x27;s different than rock, right? I was amazed that the GPR data over the area where we&#x27;ve encountered the dome-shaped object showed numerous and distinct other objects or voids that might not be natural. Now, I&#x27;m nowhere near ready to buy into the rumors that an alien base is buried in the mesa, but could there be a bunch of metal objects or tunnels of some kind in there? If so, what could they be? And who put them there? &gt;&gt; I know you did another survey. We did quite a few. &gt;&gt; You actually got some data, right? Absolutely. I would love to see that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Great. Okay, let me switch to that. &gt;&gt; In addition to the stuff that I did at the toe of the mesa, we climbed up to the top and what I use is an even deeper penetrating radar. So, this is a lower frequency and this is actually the deepest penetrating GPR in the world. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a very sensitive radar. &gt;&gt; So, when we look at the cross-section there, you can see where I am on the uh on the map at the top of the screen there, and you can see where the cursor is. Okay. So, as we&#x27;re scrolling along, everything&#x27;s fine. And it keeps going fine until you get to &gt;&gt; Hello.</p>
<p>Look at that. &gt;&gt; Look at that. This is highly anomalous. And this is a good 6 7 m across. And it starts at about 6 7 m from the surface where I was and it extends down to about 40 m which is I guess about the height of the mesa &gt;&gt; approximately right the base.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The height of the mesa &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; whatever this is is as tall as the mea right. &gt;&gt; What in the hell are we looking at here? This is 6 or 7 m across &gt;&gt; and the depth &gt;&gt; from the surface I mean there&#x27;s a bit of surface expression but it&#x27;s about five 6 m and we know that it&#x27;s about 120 ft deep maybe 20 ft wide and at least 12 ft north and south right so it could be bigger &gt;&gt; so I can&#x27;t tell you what that is but it is highly anomalous &gt;&gt; what&#x27;s also interesting is you know we did 300 mters of line. We don&#x27;t see anything else like that anywhere else. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s coincidental where your your drill site is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What in the world could Y have detected with this GPR device? It was right next to where we previously detected the dome-shaped metal object, and it was at least 20 ft wide by 120 ft tall. Are they connected or related in some way? We have to figure out how to get inside the mesa to know for sure. I&#x27;ll tell you right now, we know exactly which boulders we need to be moving out of the way. Y &gt;&gt; we&#x27;ve got a map right now of where there is an anomaly and it&#x27;s only tens of feet into the mesa. We should be digging, drilling, moving rocks right there to find out what that is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We did horizontal drilling last summer into the mesa, collecting strange material fragments. &gt;&gt; Check this out. Curious flakes of metal from within the mesa itself. These are materials of unknown origin. &gt;&gt; Wow, look at all the metal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s my ambition and all of our ambition to determine what this material really is and what it&#x27;s doing there. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no telling how much of this metallic crap there is still in that hillside. &gt;&gt; We have to continue searching into the depths of the mesa. We know we&#x27;ve got a lot of ironbearing material coming out of there with those other elements to europium &gt;&gt; that seems artificially manufactured, not a natural process creating it. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s even been described as something having been made in a furnace.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s not natural. &gt;&gt; I could line up a crane company to come out and start moving those boulders off. Uh going to have a little bit of sight prep that needs to happen to get the crane back there. But I really think it&#x27;d be beneficial to to pull those boulders off and then let&#x27;s bring in a drilling rig and let&#x27;s try to pierce the mea a little bit higher. I mean, if we do that, maybe that gets us up above that hard metal disc that&#x27;s underneath.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m I&#x27;m all for it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh so I mean, we&#x27;ve got our work cut out for us and we&#x27;ve got some spots that we didn&#x27;t have before. And Yiana, really appreciate the work that you do. This is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I want to get out there and start throwing rocks. Let&#x27;s go get a shovel and a pick and start. &gt;&gt; Hey Jake, how are you? &gt;&gt; Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Hey man.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing? A couple of days after Yan Frank presented us with the GPR data showing numerous anomalies in the mesa near the dome-shaped metal object we discovered last year. &gt;&gt; Getting ready to move some dirt. &gt;&gt; Thomas Winterton brought local contractor Jake Huffman back out to the ranch to help prep the area for a major excavation so we can find out what could be buried in there. &gt;&gt; So, uh Jake and I can bring this crane in. Obviously, we&#x27;ve got to get it across the canal.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re just going to put a temporary little culvert in there. We can get the crane across, start moving some rocks. The crane needs 30 feet to be able to spread his outriggers out. And we need to get him as close to those rocks as possible because we&#x27;re estimating some of these rocks are going to weigh as much as 50,000 lbs. &gt;&gt; I believe it.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re going to build a 30 foot by 30 foot pad back in there so we can get him right up next to those rocks. &gt;&gt; Sounds good. In order to get the giant 175 ton crane over to where we need to lift boulders off the mesa, it&#x27;s going to be a massive project. First, Tom and Jake will have to move tons of earth to form a bridge over the canal between the road and the mesa.</p>
<p>Then, they have to clear and level off a goodiz pad where they can park the crane close enough to remove many of the huge boulders. I think it&#x27;s going to take us a couple days to get the pad ready. So, I think we start slinging some dirt. &gt;&gt; Sounds good to me. &gt;&gt; Hey, we&#x27;ll get out of your way.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Watch yourself. &gt;&gt; In preparation for our surgical examination of the mesa. There&#x27;s a lot of work that needs to be done. Thomas is having to put a culvert in place. &gt;&gt; How does that look? Looks good to me.</p>
<p>What we&#x27;re doing here with these excavators and this massive crane is by far the largest scale that we&#x27;ve ever done here on Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll try to get across. &gt;&gt; This is a lot of work. It involves a lot of digging, but we need to get after it. And I&#x27;m anxious to find out what&#x27;s inside that messa.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll hopefully help us with some answers as to what truly is going on on Skinwalker Ranch. I&#x27;m going to take the color camera and we&#x27;re going to put it right up here. I think just pull in right in here. Yeah, that&#x27;ll be good. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Since it was going to take several days to complete the prep work at the mesa. &gt;&gt; Hey Bett, everything okay? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, who wants to operate the camera while I tell them what to do back there? &gt;&gt; I can do it. &gt;&gt; You want to do it? Later that evening, we welcome Berdett Anderson from a company called Photron Cameras to help us with a new experiment at the Triangle. &gt;&gt; Just hit the green button.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He specializes in a high-speed camera system that can shoot thousands of frames per second. &gt;&gt; Everything&#x27;s talking correctly. &gt;&gt; Our eyes basically detect somewhere between 24 and 30 frames per second. The advantage of using a high-speed camera out here is if you have things that are moving that you&#x27;re just not quite catching, if you&#x27;re ready for it, you get a very good look at it. My camera will shoot at 100,000 or a million frames per second.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s load a rocket. &gt;&gt; Red one first. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Our plan was to launch rockets up through the triangle where we&#x27;ve seen numerous UAPs and detected what we believe to be some kind of anomaly between 300 and 5,000 ft. &gt;&gt; Okay, it&#x27;s on.</p>
<p>Yeah. While Berdett photographed each launch at a thousand frames per second with both color and infrared cameras. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait. What&#x27;s this right here? What&#x27;s this? &gt;&gt; Look, what&#x27;s this? What&#x27;s this? &gt;&gt; We got something. We got something.</p>
<p>When we&#x27;ve seen UAPs here in the past, the UAP appeared and vanished. We&#x27;ve gotten quick glimpses of them. &gt;&gt; Hey, look. UAP right there. Yep.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; But then they tend to just disappear before we can really see what they are. &gt;&gt; Are they always that bright? It&#x27;s &gt;&gt; gone. Here we go. Let&#x27;s go straight up. Tell me when you&#x27;re good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s fine. So, we&#x27;re hoping that Berdett&#x27;s cameras will help us get a much better look at anything that might appear in the sky during our rocket launches tonight. &gt;&gt; I hope that works. All right. &gt;&gt; I learned about the investigations at Skinwalker Ranch through Travis.</p>
<p>And some of the things they hadn&#x27;t done yet is tried to catch things in high speed because there&#x27;s so many fastm moving things that happen here that you don&#x27;t get to grasp with your eye. And that&#x27;s kind of where our Fortron cameras come into play. &gt;&gt; We got it. &gt;&gt; They slow down reality. So anything you can&#x27;t see with your eye, we can catch with the cameras.</p>
<p>And anything you just kind of saw with your eye, we can slow it down so you can get a very good look at it. &gt;&gt; The rocket, it&#x27;s ready to go. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, &gt;&gt; are you good? &gt;&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s on. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hey, Eric, do you copy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead. Be advised, we&#x27;re going to go in one minute. One minute. &gt;&gt; All right. Copy you.</p>
<p>Eric was stationed in the command center during the experiment so he could monitor for any strange energy spikes out at the triangle and keep a close eye on the ranch surveillance camera pointed in this direction. All right, here we go. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Okay, we&#x27;re hot. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody ready? Is everybody ready? Eric, be advised the rocket&#x27;s hot.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going hot now. &gt;&gt; Copy you, Travis. &gt;&gt; All right, here we go. In three, two, one. Hey, did you see that? It turned before it could get to wherever the anomaly is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; How many times have we seen that happen? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s going to land right here behind us. Right after the first rocket launched, I noticed that in midair, it suddenly veered a little off course, like it ran into something invisible that deflected it. Now, we&#x27;ve also seen that happen numerous times with other rockets and GPS devices at the Triangle. So, I was really eager to immediately launch another rocket to see what would happen next.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t that crazy? &gt;&gt; Gosh. If it ain&#x27;t one thing, it&#x27;s another &gt;&gt; Hey, Caleb, why don&#x27;t you pull the Jeep around and shine a light over here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me download this image real quick &gt;&gt; and then we can look at it again later. &gt;&gt; Won&#x27;t take long cuz there&#x27;s not much in there. Okay, we as good as we&#x27;re going to get.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hey, Eric, you copy? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead, Travis. &gt;&gt; Great. We&#x27;ve got the next one on the pad. &gt;&gt; We good? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right. Five, four, three, two, one. &gt;&gt; That is cool. &gt;&gt; Oh, that one was awesome. Well, that went up pretty high.</p>
<p>That one may end up in the in the east field. &gt;&gt; Hey, we got a light. That&#x27;s right there. That&#x27;s moving. &gt;&gt; Where? Where? &gt;&gt; Right there.</p>
<p>Right above us. &gt;&gt; What? Really? &gt;&gt; Right there. &gt;&gt; Where? Yeah, we got it. There is right there. No, this was moving pretty fast.</p>
<p>What is that? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not a plane. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not a plane. &gt;&gt; Eric, we&#x27;ve got an orange light across the river on the uh southwest side. moving pretty fast about treetop height. &gt;&gt; Look at that.</p>
<p>Still plenty bright. &gt;&gt; Dang. &gt;&gt; Hey, do you have any cameras in that direction? &gt;&gt; Yes, I do, Travis. I will take a look. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Uh, it looks like it&#x27;s turning north, doesn&#x27;t it? &gt;&gt; It does look like it&#x27;s turning north. &gt;&gt; That ain&#x27;t a satellite, guys. I don&#x27;t know where it came from, but just after we launched our second rocket at the Triangle area, probably the most prominent UAP I&#x27;ve ever seen appeared over Skinwalker Ranch. Eric, we got something moving right overhead of us right now. It&#x27;s moving slightly northeast.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s orange. We And it doesn&#x27;t look like a satellite. Do you see it in the camera? I&#x27;m going to try to track it. You see it? Hey, come. Hey, looks like it sped up.</p>
<p>Did it look like it just sped up to y&#x27;all? &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. &gt;&gt; It just sped up, &gt;&gt; Eric. It&#x27;s almost right over you now. And it&#x27;s moving really fast. &gt;&gt; Not seeing it, &gt;&gt; Travis.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have it. &gt;&gt; Ask Eric if he&#x27;s got anything on the ADSB. Eric, is there anything on the ADSB? It would be going east northeast right now directly over the ranch. &gt;&gt; Copy you. I&#x27;ll check.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve never seen an aircraft maneuver like this thing, but Thomas was right to have Eric check his automatic dependent surveillance broadcasting tracker. It monitors the signals that airplanes and jets are required by law to emit. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve got eyes on the ADSB map. You know, I get aircraft at as far out as 130 mi. There&#x27;s nothing over us.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing near us. &gt;&gt; It was clearly going due north and then it dog leg and it sped up. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it came across and then it like turned. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#x27;s still going. Look at it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, if that was a satellite, you&#x27;d expect it to start fading out. &gt;&gt; By now, it&#x27;d be fading out. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s no satellite. &gt;&gt; Did it just It just vanished. That thing stayed bright and just went away.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I don&#x27;t see any more. &gt;&gt; I think we got to get that rocket up and see if we can make it. &gt;&gt; Yep, I hear you. &gt;&gt; Replicate it. &gt;&gt; That was not a satellite.</p>
<p>So, what was that? Right here over the ranch. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead, Thomas. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re good. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; One more sparky rocket. Okay. Perfect. We couldn&#x27;t wait to see if launching another rocket would evoke the UAP to reappear or stimulate another one or who knows what else.</p>
<p>And also, I hope that Berdette was getting great pictures that would help us figure out what it was. Hook the wires up. Uh, let me make sure it&#x27;s off. Hang on. &gt;&gt; Are we good here? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&#x27;re good. &gt;&gt; Lights on. &gt;&gt; Lights on. &gt;&gt; Hey, Eric, be advised. We&#x27;re ready for launch number three &gt;&gt; in about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Are you ready? &gt;&gt; I am ready. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;re good to go. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>You &gt;&gt; going in five, four, three, two, one. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a malfunction. Everybody watch out. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh.</p>
<p>Oh, it&#x27;s unfair. &gt;&gt; We got a fire. We got a fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, dang. &gt;&gt; We set the rocket up and we we&#x27;re ready to launch this thing.</p>
<p>As the launch starts, it looks like a perfect launch from the beginning. And what we see is that the rocket takes off, clears the tower, gets to somewhere, I&#x27;m estimating between 30 and 50 ft. And then suddenly there&#x27;s a a big flash of light and uh what sounded like a pop, maybe even an explosion. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s burned down. The motor burned out.</p>
<p>Holy crap. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve yet to see that. &gt;&gt; What would cause that? &gt;&gt; What would cause that? &gt;&gt; The motor blew up. It It deflogated inside the rocket. Wow.</p>
<p>Hey, Eric. You copy? &gt;&gt; I copy you, Drevis. Looked like we had a lawn dart. &gt;&gt; Well, it was worse than that. At about 30 ft off the launch pad, &gt;&gt; the motor exploded, blew out the tail section of the rocket, and then it laarded from probably 200 ft up &gt;&gt; and started a fire.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s go look at the high speed cuz it should be right in that view. &gt;&gt; We recovered it. &gt;&gt; Holy crap. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what a night. &gt;&gt; What What to That motor blew up.</p>
<p>It literally exploded. I&#x27;ve never seen uh I&#x27;ve seen experimental motors do that, Caleb, but I&#x27;ve never seen a storebought motor defleate like that. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Hey, Travis. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; we caught the malfunction on on the highspeed.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, check this out. There&#x27;s something on the camera. &gt;&gt; Something I&#x27;ve never seen before.</p>
<p>Check this out. So, as it&#x27;s going, look what you&#x27;ve got. There&#x27;s something in the sky above the rocket right here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look at that.</p>
<p>Look at the lightning. &gt;&gt; No. No way. &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; I see.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s literally something. We&#x27;re maybe looking at the anomaly for the first time, guys. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; There is literally something.</p>
<p>And we may be looking at the anomaly for the first time, guys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look at that. Look at the light. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>Now, the rocket hits the rocket blows up right when it hits. Oh, &gt;&gt; yeah, brother. Right here. Look at that. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Holy crap. All right, Berdick, could you play it one more time? I want to make sure I saw what I think I just saw. After four years of investigating Skinwalker Ranch as a team, we finally got good visual evidence of something incredible at the Triangle. Just as we launched a rocket, Berdett Anderson captured some kind of bloblike feature on his high-speed camera that literally appeared out of nowhere and caused the rocket to explode. It was something that none of us could see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That cloud remained intact. the whole thing. This isn&#x27;t an anomaly in the lens because it didn&#x27;t move. &gt;&gt; Could this be the phenomena that causes the energy spikes we&#x27;ve detected? And is it related to the UAPs we&#x27;ve seen? All I know is we may finally be getting closer to possible answers. Think about all the rockets that hit about that same spot and veered off.</p>
<p>So, you can see it right there. There&#x27;s something in the sky. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s already illuminated by the light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s not a cloud in the sky.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s not a cloud in the sky. And so what? &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s no dust. &gt;&gt; And then it look, it&#x27;s almost there. Right there. It&#x27;s like it hits right on something or zap or whatever.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Boom. &gt;&gt; Boom. &gt;&gt; And it is exactly &gt;&gt; Oh my god. You can&#x27;t make it up. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Usually I can explain everything I&#x27;ve seen in a high-speed camera when I record it. But when we shot the third rocket, as soon as that rocket started illuminating, we saw something that wasn&#x27;t there in the second shot. I can&#x27;t explain what it is. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that come off a Photron camera. Holy crap.</p>
<p>Oh my god. &gt;&gt; Well, Travis, that&#x27;s only 30 feet 30 40 feet above us. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. 40 ft high. What are the odds of that happening right there with other rockets in that same spot? Last year, we attempted to launch a 15t tall rocket through the anomaly above the triangle.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There she go. Uh-oh. That motor blew &gt;&gt; and it exploded in nearly the same spot. &gt;&gt; Oh. And shortly after that, we saw a UAP appear over the triangle.</p>
<p>Look at that. Look at that. Which then vanished into thin air. What did it disappear into? Is it a portal? Are we seeing portals open? Yeah, I couldn&#x27;t possibly know what this phenomenon was, but we now have a clear location to focus our investigation. &gt;&gt; Okay, we caught something cool, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s just more validation.</p>
<p>We got to call Eric and tell him this. Eric, you are not going to believe what the high-speed caught. There is a thing in the sky. The rocket hits it and explodes. That is unbelievable.</p>
<p>I want to see that footage. My gosh. Helicopter. Helicopter. Helicopter coming right over.</p>
<p>Eric, we got a helicopter right over the ranch right now. Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; I am getting no helicopter above the ranch on the ADSB receiver. Here we have a helicopter right over the triangle. &gt;&gt; Hey, it just went dark &gt;&gt; and it just vanished. But we still hear it.</p>
<p>Not that &gt;&gt; there&#x27;s light right there. &gt;&gt; It went behind the anomaly. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a bigger helicopter. &gt;&gt; Why? Why right now? Why right now? Eric, it came over us. We lost the lights for a second and then it turned away from the anomaly and turned souththeast.</p>
<p>Well, whoever they were, they weren&#x27;t transponding. &gt;&gt; A helicopter that size not transponding. &gt;&gt; Well, did you see that? &gt;&gt; We did this. &gt;&gt; The helicopter looks like it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; coming back around. &gt;&gt; Helicopter&#x27;s turning back around.</p>
<p>Eric, &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve got eyes on him. &gt;&gt; Where did that just come out of? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s coming back. &gt;&gt; Eric, that helicopter&#x27;s coming back at us. Do you see that? Yeah, I&#x27;ve got him. All right, now you&#x27;re mine &gt;&gt; again.</p>
<p>Travis, this aircraft is not transponding. &gt;&gt; The aircraft is not transponding &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s slowing down and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s orbiting the range. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s doing surveillance right now. to the range. We have a helicopter right over the triangle right now.</p>
<p>Right overhead. It&#x27;s doing surveillance right now. The ranch. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re definitely watching. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re definitely over the ranch looking at us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Looking at us. Shortly after this UAP sighting and after this rocket blows up, all of a sudden, a helicopter comes flying directly over us. &gt;&gt; Look at them. They&#x27;re turning again. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they are clearing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They are watching. &gt;&gt; And then we also had that other light that we saw earlier. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; As that helicopter sitting there hovering, my mind is immediately trying to figure out who this could be that&#x27;s watching us. &gt;&gt; Hey, Eric.</p>
<p>Uh, are you sure that there&#x27;s nothing on the ADSB? Travis, this helicopter is not transponding as far as I can tell cuz I&#x27;m getting aircraft 100 miles to the south of here. So, it&#x27;s not a connectivity issue. &gt;&gt; And he&#x27;s staying right over us and orbiting and orbiting. &gt;&gt; Well, someone&#x27;s taking an interest in what we&#x27;re doing. There&#x27;s nothing over us.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing near us. And he has not shown up at all. This is an aircraft that is deliberately not transponding while flying over the ranch. &gt;&gt; All I know is there&#x27;s an aircraft flying after night, which means they got night vision. &gt;&gt; There are not any commercial helicopters around here with night vision capability.</p>
<p>The only thing this could be then is a military helicopter. What is the military doing flying over Skinwalker Ranch while we&#x27;re doing this experiment and while we find something that we&#x27;ve never seen before? I don&#x27;t like the feeling of that. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t like that crap either. &gt;&gt; Hey, Eric. Um, are you do you have any of the ranch cameras &gt;&gt; on that helicopter? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve got multiple of the ranch cameras on him.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He is sitting still and hovering watching us. &gt;&gt; That is exactly right. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s really spooking us and uh pissing us off at the same time. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m right there with you, Travis. Well, Travis, it&#x27;s pretty clear somebody is taking an interest in what we&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It It really It&#x27;s a little bit scary. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re leaving. How long they cover? Like four or five minutes? &gt;&gt; Oh, 10 minutes. &gt;&gt; What the heck? &gt;&gt; And now they&#x27;re headed back towards uh Roosevelt. &gt;&gt; Roosevelt.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They are all but gone now. It it came by to show us that it knew we were doing something. I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s possible somebody saw rockets and they called, you know, ATF or something and that was an ATF. &gt;&gt; ATF has a helicopter with the Uni Basin.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They they could have hired somebody, right? &gt;&gt; There are no helicopters out here equipped with night vision. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a good point. I mean, is there there&#x27;s not a military base near I mean, right nearby that has helicopters. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re talking minutes. Yeah.</p>
<p>Who alerted him that fast? &gt;&gt; And where was that helicopter? Where did it come from? How did it get here so quick? It&#x27;s well known that the federal government investigated Skinwalker Ranch in the past, but I&#x27;m not aware of any current government investigations here. So, are we being spied on while we conduct our operations? I don&#x27;t know, but I want to find out. &gt;&gt; What a night. &gt;&gt; Hey, look. Uh, we&#x27;ve got a lot of equipment here.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s getting late. &gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s get cleaned up, shall we? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, let&#x27;s pack up.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s get wrapped up. What the heck is going on in that space above this area? What are we seeing? Is there in fact exotic physics playing out in the space just above the triangle? That&#x27;s what we hope to find out. &gt;&gt; We may have found a real unexplained phenomena above the triangle that nobody has ever seen ever before. Could this new anomaly, this blob, be the cause of each of these incidents over the triangle? We are on the verge of getting the very answers that we&#x27;ve been seeking for years. We&#x27;ve made incredible progress in documenting the reality of the phenomena.</p>
<p>We are just getting started and scratching the surface of what we are really dealing with here at Skinwalker Ranch. I&#x27;ve arranged for a crane to come in and to lift a lot of these big rocks at the bottom of the meat. &gt;&gt; This 1.6 That 6 GHz signal seems to be coming from right there where that big crane is. We&#x27;re going to probe that space out at the triangle. Caleb will be releasing projectiles &gt;&gt; where I saw a flash.</p>
<p>Holy crap. &gt;&gt; This is a video recording taken from the triangle &gt;&gt; right there. &gt;&gt; Holy cow. &gt;&gt; Hey, we got a light that&#x27;s moving. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right there.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s no satellite. &gt;&gt; It just vanished. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a malfunction. Everybody watch out. There&#x27;s something in the sky above the rocket right here.</p>
<p>We may be looking at the anomaly for the first time, guys. We have a helicopter right over the triangle right now. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s pretty clear somebody is taking an interest in what we&#x27;re doing. &gt;&gt; There is a ranch in northern Utah. It is considered the epicenter of the strangest and most disturbing phenomena on Earth.</p>
<p>Animal mutilations, bizarre UFO sightings, and unusual energies that have proven harmful to humans. For 20 years, the federal government tried to find answers and failed. Now, a new team of dedicated scientists, researchers, and experts has taken over. They are determined to solve the mystery and reveal the secret of Skinwalker Ranch. Well, we got the rockets.</p>
<p>Eric, your payloads are in here. Oh, wow. But look at that. That thing blew up out of the side. I&#x27;ve never in my life seen one of these little motors do that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen them all blow out the bottom or the top, &gt;&gt; but I&#x27;ve launched thousands of that particular motor and never seen that in my life. Never. &gt;&gt; After seeing another UAP during a rocket experiment at the Triangle last night, we couldn&#x27;t wait to review the high-speed camera footage that Berdet Anderson recorded. We had just launched a rocket up through the previously identified anomalous zone between 300 and 5,000 ft high. And right after the rocket cleared the launch tower, it appeared to hit something and mysteriously exploded.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve got to see what BDET captured on the highspeed. &gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t wait. &gt;&gt; It is unbelievable. So, after all the time we spent investigating how the triangle might be connected to the weird phenomena that we&#x27;ve seen on Skinwalker Ranch, we were really hoping that Berdett&#x27;s high-speed camera system, which takes a thousand pictures per second, would help us figure out just what in the heck destroyed our rocket. Now, before we go any further, before you hit the play button, look at that screen really closely and see if you see anything that shouldn&#x27;t be there.</p>
<p>One of these things is not like the others. Well, I&#x27;m seeing something there that I don&#x27;t see in the surveillance camera footage. &gt;&gt; Where do you see it? &gt;&gt; Well, high in the screen towards the center. &gt;&gt; There you go. Now, uh watch as it moves a little uh more into the video what what that becomes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, look at that. &gt;&gt; Okay, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s clearly becoming illuminated or something and it&#x27;s growing in size and it looks like an object right there. Look, the rocket&#x27;s not even close to it yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there is I mean there is some uh flare.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But which is to be expected, but there&#x27;s something else going on I think. &gt;&gt; Yep. Now watch what happens right here. Right as the rocket gets there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Boom. Right at exactly the same level where we first see this thing. This rocket&#x27;s exploding. And Oh yeah. You can see how the the shock wave has cleared out the the the trail.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Can you can measure the distance on this, right? Yeah. You know the field of view and everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I did some measuring on that already actually. So basically this long line on the right was measuring from the base of where the rocket &gt;&gt; started.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then this other green point up here is where the about where the explosion took place. Okay. And how high is that? &gt;&gt; 31 ft. &gt;&gt; Didn&#x27;t the lock guys tell us that the flight computer on the big rocket last summer went 31 ft.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Isn&#x27;t that what they told us? You got to be kidding me. &gt;&gt; Last fall, a team from Lock Precision built a custom 15t tall rocket that exploded right after launch. &gt;&gt; There she go. Uh-oh, that motor blew.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, just like what happened last night. And then moments later, we saw a UAP ascend high above the triangle and vanish into thin air. &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, it disappeared. Can you replay that? Could this bloblike thing that appeared just 31 ft high be the anomaly that we&#x27;ve been trying to pinpoint at the Triangle for the last four years? If so, then what the heck could it be? And how might it be related to the UAPs we keep seeing? &gt;&gt; Could this be a portal or maybe even just a force field? &gt;&gt; Caleb, it&#x27;s a great question. We&#x27;ve got to dig through this data and this video and do a lot more analysis and a lot more thinking.</p>
<p>Who knows what it is? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll give you this. It&#x27;s definitely suggestive. &gt;&gt; Yes, I&#x27;m not ruing it out. &gt;&gt; For a thousand years, there&#x27;s been stories about interdimensional portals on Skinwalker Ranch among the local indigenous tribes, and even from when the federal government worked with Robert Bigalow to investigate the property back in the 1990s and early 2000s. All right, let&#x27;s turn this thing on.</p>
<p>What is that? But what really makes me wonder if it could be true is that in 2019, I detected an energy pulse oscillating the entire spectrum from 35 megahertz to 1.6 GHz. That&#x27;s an immense amount of energy that I just don&#x27;t understand. This is the kind of energy that many scientists have suggested might be required to create or be a product of a wormhole. So, is Caleb&#x27;s question about portals crazy? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe not.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s just walk through it. All right. Step through it. All right. Right here.</p>
<p>You see the It flares. That&#x27;s the instant of explosion apparently. Right. What&#x27;s interesting? Go back one one step, Berdette. That flare is gone.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a flare right here. Right. Go go go one more forward now. And you see is that is that camera flare or is that actually light bouncing off of something that&#x27;s in front of it? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. I noticed something before the explosion a few frames back that got my attention to the left of that plume.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ll bet if we if we if we take it back a bit, it&#x27;ll show up &gt;&gt; there. Oh, I saw it. I did. That was bright, dude. I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t see that right there.</p>
<p>Okay, back up. Just &gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;re talking about this right here. &gt;&gt; There it is right there. Look at that. &gt;&gt; Right there.</p>
<p>that I noticed that in one frame there&#x27;s a bright light just above the mesa. It&#x27;s pretty suspicious. I don&#x27;t see anything to account for it directly. I don&#x27;t see anything that would have mechanically interfered with the launch. What we have are a lot of separate pieces of what seems to be an incomplete puzzle.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got something producing a bright spot here in the sky that lasts 1 millisecond. This is a very short fast event. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, this may be the first time we&#x27;ve actually got evidence of there being some physical something above the triangle, the object, whether it&#x27;s a portal or a a UFO or or some whatever else. I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s something. God.</p>
<p>Well, this and the rest of what we&#x27;ve seen taken in the aggregate, including the UAP or the possible UAP that you guys tracked directly overhead. And what was up with that helicopter? You know, I went for over everything we&#x27;ve got. Who knows, we may have even missed additional clues in what you&#x27;ve given us. So, we&#x27;ve got our work cut out for us. &gt;&gt; Well, Berdette, I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I guess uh last thing we need to do is uh report back to Brandon to tell him about that helicopter. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this will blow his mind. &gt;&gt; You there? We are in motion. &gt;&gt; Copy that, Caleb.</p>
<p>Thank you. &gt;&gt; After we told Brandon Fugal, the owner of Skinwalker Ranch about what happened at the triangle and the helicopter, he said he would look into it with some of his associates in the state government and then personally come out to the ranch and report back to us. So, while waiting for that, we turned our focus back to another major spot of interest in our current investigations, the Mesa. &gt;&gt; If it&#x27;s possible, I&#x27;d like to bring him in a little further back. Last week, we conducted new ground penetrating radar scans of the mesa where one year ago, we drilled up against what the data suggests could be a buried 400 ft long metal object shaped like a dome and possibly even made of materials similar to those that NASA uses to build space shuttles.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re just going to have to see what we get. The new scans identified a number of possibly metal anomalies, including a vertical one behind the dome-shaped object that&#x27;s 20 ft wide and over 100 ft tall. &gt;&gt; Whatever this is is as tall as the mea. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, now we&#x27;re trying a different method to figure out just what could be buried inside the mesa.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; He&#x27;s going to be moving this crane over this way. He&#x27;ll be driving right up to about right here. You can come just a little bit more if you want. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve arranged for a crane to come in and to lift a lot of these big rocks out of the way and hopefully get some answers as to what sits inside that messa. Okay, we&#x27;ll run our outriggers out and then we&#x27;ll take a peek.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Sometimes when we&#x27;re making changes to the landscape, even small changes, something unusual happens, often something that we can measure. so that we will be stationed nearby the activity with detectors of various kinds. &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s good. &gt;&gt; Hopefully, this will yield some very interesting results as Thomas makes the initial changes to the mesa aren&#x27;t light, are they? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; There.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Good. You good? The fact that there is a metallic substance in this messa that has the same properties as space shuttle tiles for re-entry. What in the world are we dealing with? And how did it get here? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I want to get your eyes on this.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got a 1.6 on the Omni. Take a look. &gt;&gt; Watch this for a second. Look at that. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Comes and goes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The center is at 1.6 right on that. Okay. So, there&#x27;s a transient. It was It was silent and then it came back. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Just as the crane was about to start removing boulders from the site where we detected the anomalous objects, Eric&#x27;s main energy detector, called a spectrum analyzer got a reading at the mysterious 1.6 GHz radio frequency that we&#x27;ve seen during a number of our experiments. And it&#x27;s a signal that I can&#x27;t rule out being some kind of communication. But if it is, who or what is trying to communicate with us? And from where? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; You see how it&#x27;s intermittent? &gt;&gt; Yeah, something&#x27;s happening. &gt;&gt; We getting close.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s not giving me the option to pick up my counterwe right now. &gt;&gt; You what? &gt;&gt; It won&#x27;t allow me to pick it up right now. &gt;&gt; Is it not operating the way it usually does? &gt;&gt; Nope. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s giving me a glitch here. &gt;&gt; Hang on for a sec.</p>
<p>Hey guys. Uh, I would say that you&#x27;re not going to believe this, but you&#x27;re probably going to believe this. Uh, &gt;&gt; we&#x27;re having some issues up here with the crane. No, &gt;&gt; no, we&#x27;re going to believe it given &gt;&gt; What kind of issues are you having, Tom? &gt;&gt; So, the electronics in the crane are not allowing him to pick up the counterwe. &gt;&gt; Uh, he&#x27;s sitting here shaking his head.</p>
<p>He can&#x27;t can&#x27;t get his head wrapped around. What&#x27;s going on? &gt;&gt; Are you guys seeing anything down there? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Is this responding to that big piece of equipment over there? Just as Alan Mortonson was about to start removing boulders from the mesa where we&#x27;ve detected two massive, possibly metallic anomalies, the controls on his crane froze up. And at the same time, Air Spectrum Analyzer picked up the 1.6 6 GHz signal that we detected during a lot of our experiments, especially when we started digging on Skinwalker Ranch. &gt;&gt; Hey, Thomas, can you hear me? &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Could you get them to rotate the arm? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll ask him, but he&#x27;s telling me that the cranes, the electronics aren&#x27;t letting him do anything right now. So now we are taking big metal objects and intimately connecting them to the ground and we&#x27;re seeing an electromagnetic signal come out in the direction of those big metal objects is the source of that signal inside the ground. Maybe what people have been seeing all this time was when you dig things happen. They&#x27;re touching the source that&#x27;s sending out the signal. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve seen people react when we&#x27;ve seen it pop up.</p>
<p>We have we&#x27;ve had all sorts of instances with medical episodes and one the one footprint that&#x27;s left behind is that 1.6 GHz signal. Dragon was dead right that there have been a number of times that we detected the 1.6 GHz signal when we started digging or drilling on the ranch. Heck, a few years ago, Thomas Winterton ended up in the hospital with a serious head injury after building a road on the mesa. Could the 1.6 GHz signal be the cause of that injury? And did it come from whatever is buried inside the mesa? That possibility made us all anxious to see what would happen as this operation continued. &gt;&gt; So, what would cause was that just typical or is that something that&#x27;s not typical? &gt;&gt; Um, it&#x27;s not real typical.</p>
<p>Normally, this crane works flawless. Whoa. What? We&#x27;re good now. &gt;&gt; Boy, I&#x27;m so curious to know what happened. &gt;&gt; It wouldn&#x27;t let me get in the right position to swing over and pick the counter and wait up.</p>
<p>But I mean, right now it&#x27;s okay. &gt;&gt; So, you&#x27;re good to go now? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;re good to go. And we&#x27;ll position on that first rock whenever you&#x27;re ready. &gt;&gt; Well, he&#x27;s got things squared away now, we think. So, he&#x27;s going to go ahead and boom out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll see if we can start moving some rock. &gt;&gt; Heck yeah. Heck yeah. Right there. That&#x27;s good.</p>
<p>Okay. &gt;&gt; Watch out. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, we got the first rock in the air. &gt;&gt; Got it. It&#x27;s going to swing that way.</p>
<p>So, be ready. &gt;&gt; Look here. They&#x27;re 1.6 six signal has grown some with whatever he&#x27;s doing there. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; So think about this.</p>
<p>If there is some metal dome shaped structure under the ground and we just put a big metal rod above it, we&#x27;ve just created a big dish that we would be seeing a signal from. What is energizing the whole system? &gt;&gt; Where is the energy source? Where is the signal coming from? Oo, easy, easy, easy. We&#x27;ve been looking for this source of this 1.6 GHz now for 3 years going on four and we&#x27;ve never found it. This might be the closest experiment we&#x27;ve come to that is tying us into that signal and where it&#x27;s coming from. Dumb.</p>
<p>Oh, they&#x27;re gone. How does that happen? Well, I can verify that we&#x27;ve got nothing here now. That&#x27;s a little creepy. We were all baffled when the 1.6 6 GHz signal stopped broadcasting. But then we realized it happened exactly when Allen had stopped moving the boulders.</p>
<p>It just looked like more evidence that the two things were connected. We&#x27;re getting about to the end of what we can do safely. You agree? &gt;&gt; Yeah. The bottom rocks are supporting the whole hillside. So any more would cause a slide.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a very dangerous area to work in with the loose rocks, everything. And you never know what may happen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we&#x27;ll keep that in mind. Looking at it, I think we get an excavator in here, clean that up nice, we&#x27;ll have a perfect place to get the drill into, and we&#x27;ll head straight for that anomaly that we saw in the data.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It was disappointing to have to stop removing the boulders, but safety is always the priority. We&#x27;re not giving up on figuring out what the dome-shaped object and the vertical anomaly that we&#x27;ve detected in the mesa are. So, we&#x27;ve got to bring a drill rig back out here and get to the bottom of this. Thanks for having us. Good start.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an anomaly in there. We just got to get to it. &gt;&gt; John, welcome to the ranch. Thanks, brother. Good to be &gt;&gt; The next day, Brandon Fugal alerted us that he and his brother Cameron were bringing Utah Attorney General Shawn Reyes to the ranch to hear more about the mysterious helicopter that showed up during our last experiment at the Triangle.</p>
<p>So, we were all eager to hear his perspective and figure out as a group what our next investigation there should be. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been anxious to get here. I understand with some very suspicious activity occurring and some concerns over our airspace, it was important to have Attorney General Shawn Reyes come back and get a briefing on what is happening here with our investigation. &gt;&gt; Gentlemen, great to be back with you in person. I&#x27;ve been monitoring and keeping tabs with Brandon.</p>
<p>I know you all are doing great things out here. &gt;&gt; Well, General, I think uh we have some uh evidence and some information to show you guys. Brandon and General Reyes, you know that we sometimes see uh air traffic over the ranch. Sometimes they can&#x27;t identify the craft using ADSB or or any other uh method available to us. And we had an event like that very recently.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m going to bring up the all sky camera. I&#x27;m hoping that the sound will carry through for this That&#x27;s sounds like Blackhawk to me. &gt;&gt; Really? Yeah. I&#x27;ve been around aviation my whole life. I&#x27;ve been around every type of helicopter and airplane, military and civilian.</p>
<p>And you can get a lot from the tailrotor sounds of these aircraft. &gt;&gt; That sounds crazy. It sounds crazy. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, in your opinion, based off of the sound, this sounds to you like a military helicopter? &gt;&gt; Sounds to me like a Blackhawk to me.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, as crazy as it sounds, it&#x27;s almost like, is this a Men in Black type of a thing? &gt;&gt; Tell me you got ADSB, Dad on it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I did not get a signal from this helicopter. It is not legal to turn your ADSB off like that &gt;&gt; unless you&#x27;re military.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If that really was a Blackhawk military helicopter that flew over the ranch the other night, it just makes me wonder, did they just happen to show up right after we saw that mysterious blob destroy our rocket over the triangle? Or are we under constant secret surveillance out here? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re a sovereign state. We have our own constitutional rights and uh violations of our state&#x27;s sovereignty and our state&#x27;s rights we have to take very very seriously. &gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;m glad to have the top law enforcement officer in the state of Utah here just to get eyes on it and and give your perspective. &gt;&gt; I have a lot of friends and a lot of assets in this state and I would love to get to the bottom of this and so next time we get together hopefully I&#x27;ll have some information. a covert military helicopter entering the airspace and then hovering south of Homestead 1 watching the experiments.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that it&#x27;s created some concern for the attorney general. Well, as we&#x27;re teeing up our next series of experiments in order to better understand what the hell is going on here, I think we&#x27;re hopefully going to see some more results. So, how do you feel about using the helicopter for more experiments over the triangle area? &gt;&gt; Well, I think we have to uh we&#x27;re getting such compelling data. I want to I want to explore further. Uh the helicopter is safe and I&#x27;ve pre-flighted it.</p>
<p>I feel good about it today. Let&#x27;s do it. &gt;&gt; Well, with that, are you willing to stick around and participate in an experiment with us? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Great. Let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s prepare.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s get moving. Yeah, we got stuff to do. &gt;&gt; While we&#x27;re figuring out our next move at the mea, having Brandon&#x27;s helicopter here gives us the perfect opportunity to investigate for more evidence of the blob-shaped thing we just encountered only 31 ft above the triangle and also to search the entire anomalous zone up as high as 5,000 ft above ground level. &gt;&gt; What do we got going on, guys? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to probe the triangle at or just beneath the anomaly. So, we&#x27;ll be releasing some projectiles and we&#x27;re going to do high-speed camera uh recording uh as those projectiles fall.</p>
<p>These are round dense uh black balls. Who knows? We may see some irregularity in the in the in the way they fall, the timing. &gt;&gt; Well, gentlemen, let&#x27;s proceed. All right. Our plan was to have Cameron fly Caleb and Eric above the triangle, stopping at various altitudes between 1,000 and 5,000 ft high in order to drop small weighted balls down through the anomalous zone to see if their trajectory or velocity is affected in any way by anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hey, Berdat. &gt;&gt; Hey, Thomas. &gt;&gt; Good to see you again. &gt;&gt; Good to see you, man. I&#x27;m all set up for you guys, so we&#x27;re ready to rock.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve dropped objects through the anomalous zone above the triangle before, but this time, high-speed camera expert Berdette Anderson was there to record each drop. &gt;&gt; You have the camera set up? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we&#x27;ve got two high-speed cameras back here. I wanted to show you the framing to make sure that we&#x27;re going to catch the helicopter drop and the anomaly properly. &gt;&gt; Okay. Since he can shoot 1500 frames per second, we were hoping he would be able to capture the best evidence yet of what could be the cause of all the phenomena we&#x27;ve witnessed at the triangle over the last four years.</p>
<p>Before we start, I need to make sure that my GPS tracker is on. One of the high priority items for us is to collect the data logged GPS position information for the helicopter during both phases of this experiment. Okay, if we have a space-time anomaly at the triangle, as we have speculated, it could well be that the GPS data will give us an indication as to its arrival and departure during the experiment. &gt;&gt; All systems look good. Okay, &gt;&gt; I got you, &gt;&gt; Eric.</p>
<p>All good. We will be monitoring any response that we get from the anomaly using a small handheld Spectran device. And we&#x27;ll be looking especially of course in that 1.6 GHz frequency range for what could be a response to our activity over the triangle. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re go lift off this time. Hey, Dragon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Go ahead, Travis. &gt;&gt; They just took off. &gt;&gt; Copy. &gt;&gt; Well, they&#x27;re off. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I always feel a sense of conflict having my brother operating the helicopter above the ranch, but he is eager to be a part of the discovery. Camera, do you copy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve got you loud and clear. We&#x27;re &gt;&gt; just about to hover over the triangle here. &gt;&gt; Right there. &gt;&gt; All right, Cameron.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the spot. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to vacate. We&#x27;ll give you the countdown to drop the payloads. &gt;&gt; Be ready. &gt;&gt; We can drop right now and we&#x27;ll be good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, we&#x27;re ready to drop. We can clearly see the triangle out the right side of the aircraft. Okay, Cameron, in five, four, three, two, one, go. &gt;&gt; Holy crap. &gt;&gt; There it is.</p>
<p>See it right there? Yeah, &gt;&gt; there it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, so there. Look, you see they just dropped another one. They&#x27;re going to do five. I&#x27;ve seen at least three.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; A drop&#x27;s away you can go. Cameron, &gt;&gt; I dropped the way. &gt;&gt; Uh, Cameron. Yeah, I&#x27;ve got a 1.6 GHz signal. I&#x27;m still trying to sort out why I&#x27;m getting it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s crazy. All right. &gt;&gt; Holy crap. Hey, uh, is this getting some pretty sharp pains in my head? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; For now, I&#x27;m just going to leave the ranch for a little while.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Please, just go make sure and then let us know how you&#x27;re feeling once you get off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thomas all of a sudden turned to me and said, &quot;I have a headache and I&#x27;m leaving the ranch.&quot; And given his history on this ranch, I was 100% on board with getting him out of here. That&#x27;s not all right.</p>
<p>It proved to be a little bit more difficult for Cameron to get his helicopter in place for this thousand ft drop. And then as Thomas was sighting up the launch pad that we have there to make sure that they were directly above the triangle, he started to talk about having some neck and head pain, which is very concerning. And we decided to get him off the range. &gt;&gt; Hey Travis, do you copy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I copy. Hey, Thomas has started to get a bit of a tingling pain in his neck, so he&#x27;s decided to go ahead and leave the ranch.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Was Thomas all right? &gt;&gt; But with his history, we figured probably best to just have him go. &gt;&gt; Understood. &gt;&gt; Seems like it&#x27;s always Thomas that is targeted. &gt;&gt; Thomas told me the very first time I met him that the ranch responds to people differently. And as crazy as that sounds, I believe he&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s something going on here that seems to cause physiological effects sometimes specifically on him. So, we&#x27;re going to pay close attention to how he&#x27;s doing. &gt;&gt; Let me know uh when you guys are ready to make the drops. We&#x27;re watching you now. Copy.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; After completing the first set of ball drops over the triangle around the 1,000 ft altitude, Cameron ascended just above 5,000 ft so that Caleb could drop five more to see what would happen to them as they fell all the way through the anomalous zone. 10,000 ft above sea level. 5,000 ft over the ranch. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s interesting the winds. &gt;&gt; I can feel it pushing us back to the east there.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; I feel I can feel that. &gt;&gt; After Eric detected the 1.6 GHz signal and Thomas&#x27; health episode during the 1,00 ft drop, we didn&#x27;t know what to expect once Cameron reached the mile high zone. But as soon as he got up there, the helicopter was suddenly pushed around by major gusts of wind. Dang.</p>
<p>Uh, that&#x27;s insane. &gt;&gt; Hey, uh, Dragon. Uh, how do you copy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead, Cameron. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re right on the point where I&#x27;ve got my GPS coordinates if we want everyone far away from there. &gt;&gt; Copy that, Cameron.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s the way to go. We&#x27;ll start clearing out of the way. &gt;&gt; Roger. Climbing at about 1500 ft a minute right now. &gt;&gt; I have eyes on triangle, so Oh, getting some rain there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep, we are getting rain. &gt;&gt; They 5,000 ft. &gt;&gt; Uh oh. Though they&#x27;re at 9,750 above sea level, put them about 4,000 ft or so uh above ground level. Getting climbing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to call it when we get when we get close. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;m watching. So, approaching the 10,000 foot above sea level mark. Reducing the climb, slowing down. We&#x27;re going to get back over that triangle here.</p>
<p>Every time we get close, seems to be we really get pushed off. The winds go from about 8 knots to 35. My instruments are picking up and then the compass spins. Okay, we&#x27;re approaching. We&#x27;re at 10,000 ft.</p>
<p>Get ready. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m over the bait 10. &gt;&gt; Okay, get ready. Got to slow it down just a little bit. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re about to drop.</p>
<p>Make sure we&#x27;re all clear. &gt;&gt; Keep going west. Cameron, &gt;&gt; left. &gt;&gt; Left. &gt;&gt; Okay, get ready.</p>
<p>Set. Okay, drop. &gt;&gt; What the heck? No GPS position. Holy crap. We lost the GPS.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Where are they? Why are they going so fast? Where are they going? That is weird. &gt;&gt; Dang. &gt;&gt; I swear I saw a flash. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Hey Cameron, do you copy? &gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What are you showing your altitude at? &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re now descending through 9,400 ft above sea level. &gt;&gt; Copy that. &gt;&gt; We showed about 10. &gt;&gt; I only got four. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve dropped all of them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We dropped four of them. We got one more. Copy that. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s still headed off to the west. Where is he going? &gt;&gt; I think something&#x27;s wrong.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got lightning. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re going to abort this mission and come back for safety sake. &gt;&gt; Given the unknown nature of what we&#x27;re dealing with here on Skinwalker Ranch, security and safety are very important. We don&#x27;t know what it is that we&#x27;re interacting with. So, keeping it secure and keeping the scientific integrity of what we have going on here is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>So, we need Cameron to get back down on the ground safely. &gt;&gt; Well, dang. I&#x27;d call that a success, though. It was like right when we got over the triangle again. &gt;&gt; There are, of course, inherent dangers in flying in general, but I would say that this attempt to study this area has been a resounding success.</p>
<p>We have all kinds of new data coming up, but I want to see what was captured. That was weird. &gt;&gt; That was weird. &gt;&gt; Hey, Brandon. &gt;&gt; Good to be back, gentlemen.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s good to see you. &gt;&gt; Hey, good to see you. I&#x27;ve &gt;&gt; been worried about you. &gt;&gt; Thankfully, Thomas Winterton felt better after getting off the ranch, and we were all very relieved that he was able to come back a couple of days after our experiment. It was good timing, too, because we were just about to review the data that we had collected over the triangle with Brandon and Attorney General Shawn Reyes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Hello. It&#x27;s good to have you with us. &gt;&gt; See you all. &gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;re going to be uh looking at this uh for some of us for the very first time. And boy, do we have some interesting things coming out of it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, I&#x27;m interested and excited. uh while you were flying camera, you probably remember that I attached a GPS locator, a data logging device to the helicopter. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; Um and so I&#x27;ll share some data uh that shows the trajectory of the helicopter during that. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.</p>
<p>There clearly some issues with this. They&#x27;re jumping. They&#x27;re glaring over the trailer. &gt;&gt; My first question is I really don&#x27;t recall seeing you guys go way off of the ranch like this big top circle that&#x27;s there. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a really prominent feature in the data.</p>
<p>And so &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s miles. &gt;&gt; I know that&#x27;s not what we did with the helicopter. &gt;&gt; That was my question. &gt;&gt; Not at all. I want to draw some attention to those vertical movements.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve actually measured the vertical distance from this point here to the top of whatever this maneuver is. It&#x27;s 666.1 ft. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No way. &gt;&gt; Did you do anything? &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>I would have had to be in a hover flying straight up in a hovering climb to do that maneuver. And I wouldn&#x27;t have done that. It wouldn&#x27;t have been safe or ideal. &gt;&gt; We never did anything like that. &gt;&gt; That is strange.</p>
<p>and that it happened right above the triangle &gt;&gt; geographically does not match up with what we were playing. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s having problems with his instruments &gt;&gt; and I was feeling that buzz from that metal tower. &gt;&gt; I wonder if that is the period of time when you&#x27;re seeing the anomaly in the GPS. Thomas&#x27;s question was spoton because at the same time the helicopter GPS went haywire, he had his health episode. And this also happened right when Eric started detecting the 1.6 GHz signal over the triangle.</p>
<p>So the question was, could something have caused all those things to happen simultaneously? I&#x27;m going to share some video. This is a video recording taken from ground level right at the triangle looking up at the at the aircraft. And um well, it&#x27;s best I just show you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, anxious to see.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I&#x27;ll just ask you if you see the picture about which I&#x27;m speaking. this, as you notice, it said embossed effect &gt;&gt; uh on the uh on the caption there because what&#x27;s happening is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m applying a filter to the video. &gt;&gt; When you adjust the contrast like that, we start to see unusual features. &gt;&gt; The circles behind &gt;&gt; this artifact right here.</p>
<p>This feature right here. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. &gt;&gt; Holy cow. &gt;&gt; What is that? And it&#x27;s following you in a It&#x27;s like &gt;&gt; Yeah, there&#x27;s something following.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Gentlemen, &gt;&gt; what the heck is flying around in my state? &gt;&gt; That is probably the the most significant thing I&#x27;ve seen flying next to the helicopter. Wow. It was great that we had high-speed cameras recording our experiment over the triangle two days ago. Because at about the same time that our GPS device malfunctioned, Eric detected the 1.6 GHz signal and Thomas got a sudden headache, we captured a clear as day UAP right next to the helicopter. This is in broad daylight.</p>
<p>This is a physical UFO with the reflection off of one side glinting off of it captured all on &gt;&gt; like it&#x27;s metallic or something. &gt;&gt; That is a solid object with the same reflective quality that the helicopter exhibits right above it. &gt;&gt; Is there any chance you can zoom in on it? &gt;&gt; Um certainly. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s all right. There we go.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I was want to see right there. Almost seems like there&#x27;s a point here. &gt;&gt; I was just about to say kind of like a top, &gt;&gt; you know, like a triangle. Actually, actually, if you think about the perspective you&#x27;re looking at it, &gt;&gt; if you look at it, &gt;&gt; you can kind of see a hemisphere here and maybe a hemisphere that this could be very similar to the orb. It could be two spheres with a separation cuz it looks like there might be a separation right there.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, we captured images of a UAP at night during our drone experiment that looked very similar to the strange metallic aircraft that a Navy pilot photographed off the coast of Virginia in 2019. Now, we may have actually documented another mysterious craft in the anomalous zone above the triangle. So, what the heck is it and where did it come from? &gt;&gt; This might be the most convincing evidence I&#x27;ve seen, Brandon. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;m glad you were there, Attorney General, because at least you saw that there were other strange things happening that seemed to correspond with what we&#x27;ve captured here with this camera and this kind of phenomena being captured on camera. It is no surprise that we&#x27;re seeing military craft immediately enter the scene above the ranch.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, Brandon, I did some digging around, reached out to one of my contacts to check on the origin and destination of that Blackhawk. &gt;&gt; Oh, you found out some more information on that. &gt;&gt; I found this flight path that you can see on the screen. So if the Blackhawk took off from Hebrew Valley Airport in Hebrew City, Utah, it&#x27;s what we call McDonald airfield, came around over the ranch, and then turned around and made its way back down into the Salt Lake area.</p>
<p>And you can see that in that yellow flight path. And when we called Brandon and asked what they were doing or who it was, they had no comment. &gt;&gt; No comment. &gt;&gt; It could be of a classified nature, but obviously they&#x27;re not sharing any information. &gt;&gt; No information forthcoming.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, it&#x27;s confirmed it was a Blackhawk helicopter. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Blackhawk helicopter. How did they get here at just the right time to fly over and and see the experiment and then hover and and wait? I mean, they waited here 5 or 10 minutes, &gt;&gt; Travis, that I cannot explain. &gt;&gt; This is absolute evidence that we&#x27;re being monitored.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no other explanation. Attorney General, thank you so much for patching in. You saw it first with us. We&#x27;ll stay in touch and uh appreciate all of your help and your interest in our ongoing investigation, &gt;&gt; Mr. Fugle and your team.</p>
<p>Thank you. Always professionals, man. &gt;&gt; Thank you. All right. Thanks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, we&#x27;ve got a lot to consider. Uh this is some of the most stunning footage yet here at the ranch. So, how do we follow up on this incredible data? &gt;&gt; That really is the question. Well, and this says we need to focus on the triangle. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. We just got to figure out what to do next. Move on. &gt;&gt; All right. Let&#x27;s get you out the door.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Good to see you guys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We have definitely seen an elevated degree of interest from covert military units surveilling the property. the fact that they are not transponding, that they are cloaking their identity with intent and deliberately and I think aggressively monitoring our efforts is something that is both concerning, but it&#x27;s also validating.</p>
<p>That underscores how important the research is at Skinwalker Ranch. We don&#x27;t know what it is. There&#x27;s a big anomaly in the ground penetrating radar right there. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; What in the hell is that thing? That doesn&#x27;t look natural or like it should be there.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There we go. Oh, there it is. Hey, I just saw a purple light over there. &gt;&gt; With our night vision, there&#x27;s something right over Thomas down there in the sky blinking at about 10° up.</p>
