            <p>[Music] good evening the sunset is a disclosure of Darkness the sunset is a disclosure of stars and planets it is a disclosure of the world&#x27;s life when it lives at night the nocturnal animals as well as the Flames whisper and orbs and yet Sunset itself is only the first sign and occurs to the last moment that the sun is visible once the disc hides deep enough the sky says all is fully revealed as surely as every saucer hides what is behind it except for transparent ones of course the saucer called the sun hides the whole sky in a veil of blue you used to just be able to step outside and wait for the sunset and the last Light to disappear in the west but now you have to go to the country because people put lights up everywhere this makes a different sort of veil a yellow veil in the night if there really are unexplained objects in the night sky people living in the city wouldn&#x27;t even be able to see them most of the time because of the yellow Veil is lavender the best does Lou Alis actually have any relevance at all what more do I have to say about Prairie lights at the moment not a whole lot honestly but you know it definitely looks like an interesting Avenue of study plus weird weather but it&#x27;s because of the climate crisis all this and more tonight I&#x27;m Rachel Nelson I&#x27;m Jeff Knox tonight Louise couldn&#x27;t make it unfortunately but in any case we&#x27;re here we are here yes thank you Jeff welcome and welcome to UFOs chat everyone a chat show about our regular show UFO Sunset and now for the rebrief and now for the rebrief petrols will chase Cyclones according to a new study on Tuesday a new study was published in the journal current biology that document petrols purposefully following Cyclones Woods Hole oceanographic Institute or Whi reported on the paper the same day the desertas petrol terod droma deserta is a seabird with a breeding population of around 200 paars that Nest on bugio Island an island of Portugal that sits off the western coast of North Africa the petrols go on Long Journeys to forage crossing the Atlantic Ocean this new study finds that many petrols will actually Chase storms the wake of a storm provides favorable winds for them to follow and the storms turn up food for the for the birds to feed on as we&#x27;ve now discovered quote as we&#x27;ve now discovered deseras petrols follow hurricanes where prey have accumulated closer to the surface in the wakes of storms unot said Caroline umhofer an associate scientist of physical oceanography at the Whi and one of the paper authors quote initial studies suggested that seabirds either circumnavigate Cyclones or seek refuge in the calm eye of the storm however the deseras petrols we tracked did neither instead onethird of them followed the for days covering thousands of kilomet when we saw the data we nearly fell off our chairs this is the first time we have observed this Behavior unquote said lead author and a postdoc investigator in biology at Whi um Fernando Ventura I believe that&#x27;s the name sorry okay the Earth&#x27;s weather the Earth&#x27;s weather is getting weirder due to climate change there have been several items published this week specifically Curr concerned with the weather becoming weirder due to climate change in a piece published today on space.com contributor Daisy doovic interviewed climate scientist Katherine kho because the global average temperature is rising this means that heat waves are increasing in their intensity there&#x27;s increased storm activity and there&#x27;s a greater frequency and intensity of thunderstorms and lightning as well as an increase in wildfires heho is quoted as saying quote each of us wherever we live are experiencing the impacts of climate change today unquote another article on this quote unquote Global weirding of weather was published on Thursday in salon in it a climatologist and Deputy lead scientist at the NASA snow and ice Data Center Dr twilla Moon was quoted as saying quote along with this warming we see increases in deadly heat waves and droughts but also an increased experience of global weirding unquote she described Global weirding as quote more extreme weather events producing conditions that are entirely new for communities weather Whiplash as folks may experience quick swings between hot and cold or drought and flood and many challenges for crops Wildlife Recreation and being able to plan for what we previously considered normal weather conditions unquote this image by Cranston Herald contributor Pam shiff documents some of the damage from a Micro Burst that that happened on June 26th in Cranston Rhode Island the localized storm reportedly affected quote a tiny part of the neighborhood on minen and Beckwith streets unquote according to Chef a giant dust devil was shot on video in Rapid City South Dakota one moment please okay all right sorry about that on Wednesday a tall and Broad dust devil was caught on video near a parking lot in mards in Rapid City this is in the black hills region of South Dakota the video was shot by Joselyn Jensen and reported by knbn News Center 1 a TV station serving the Black Hills from the article um excuse me from the article by trevan Dowling and Brandt Beckman quote the temperature differential between the relatively cool grass and the hot asphalt of the Menard&#x27;s parking lot likely contributed to the creation of the Dust Devil scene on Wednesday unquote it&#x27;s a pretty cool dust devil yeah yeah it&#x27;s pretty big should have been on fire though fire tornadoes are better fire spout fire spout they&#x27;re definitely cooler looking very cool probably not too fun to be around not not the best uh company at a party yeah i&#x27; I&#x27;ve seen a lot of smaller dust devils before like just Eastern Oregon and driving through places like you know New Mexico and the deserts and whatnot big one really uh you&#x27;re having a little trouble or maybe I&#x27;m having trouble I&#x27;m not sure but am I having trouble or are you having trouble I don&#x27;t know but yeah I think I think that it it was probably on your end but you were cutting out quite a bit Ah but weird is you you seem to be doing fun now though h okay well I will try and go ahead and get my update now then hopefully I don&#x27;t cut out okay Co sounds sounds good all right we&#x27;ll do this here all right so uh when I had given this talked about this case last week uh there was a a couple of things I I didn&#x27;t mention and that I didn&#x27;t include and a couple things I I also kind of got wrong uh first of all again I always started these presentations off mentioning how uh I&#x27;m probably going to mispronounced names and stuff and and I noticed I completely mispronounced uh Amy Michelle&#x27;s name throughout the entire uh lecture I kept pronouncing it Mikel uh and that that I want location of this and I kind of uh glossed over it I guess last week briefly and just kind of showed this showed this map that was sketched by the John DARS which honestly does does not help a whole lot um simply because uh many of these roads are not here anymore uh this kind of uh I don&#x27;t know if you call it like an s shaped or kind of turn here uh this kimaz uh does not exist anymore so when you end up looking at satellite maps and more recent Maps it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell where it is and I had mentioned that they had built a landmark out there that I uh I thought was not ex exactly near where the landing location was it turns out it actually might be a bit closer than than I thought it was so this is the map um that or the sketch of uh the kind of location that we had from the John DARS and if you were to pull up uh it on satellite imagery today this is the area you get and you can see that Waypoint Mark there that says Valen Souls uh ET and that&#x27;s kind of supposed to indicate where they put this kind of a model of the in [Music] the with you&#x27;re cutting up again so um you might want to just repeat what you had said previously oh is it is it me cutting up I saw you cut out I don&#x27;t know who it is um I I don&#x27;t know I mean it&#x27;s not I don&#x27;t really know how that works I don&#x27;t yeah huh okay well any anyway so you can&#x27;t it&#x27;s really hard to tell where it is on this map I I wasn&#x27;t sure how close it was you could kind of if you zoom in you can see uh some abandoned structures and I I thought it was one of those three abandoned structures it turns out I was actually completely wrong um the abandoned house that they speak of is sort of a in the middle here is that really dark spot um I can&#x27;t really point it out I guess um uh but you&#x27;ll see in a second here where this house is and you can&#x27;t see that s-shaped turn like I said because that road is not there anymore so I was able to get through the help of uh Michel vent uh through up check a kmz file for Google Earth uh as well as some satellite imagery that was taken two years later and location the the mentioned hilik that when he first had the siding that he was kind of taking a smoke behind of was uh where this Vineyard was that you could no longer see in modern maps and where the this craft landed and these Trace events were uh and if we look a little bit uh closer here in this 1967 image we can see that kind of s-shaped curve and that that house that we can see still in the Modern Day images uh down there in the bottom kind of left and we can see that Vineyard that used to be there that he cut across from the path that he cut across um to get to this UFO and we can even uh and what I did is I took that map from the John DARS and I kind of resized it twisted around laid it on top of this satellite imagery and you can or not satellite but aerial photography and you can see that it&#x27;s a pretty pretty decent map match to uh what they sketched out as to where this uh object landed and where Moss is uh pointed out as standing and again here is a little bit kind of more zoomed out you can see that the H or H hillock front vard [Music] to built is uh it&#x27;s on this d6a uh and it&#x27;s real close real nearby to where this actually happened um and so you can kind of see the d6a cuts through there and this is a a picture taken from kind of a street view image on Google Google Earth of the the model that they have there now so it&#x27;s a bit different than the one I showed in the presentation with the green uh characters this one looks like it&#x27;s a bit more stable and permanent of a structure that they kind of build out there and this is another view kind of looking from the other way and these kind of uh these piles that you can see here these are the those helics uh that he was taking as kind of a smoke break uh behind that he walked around in front of to see the object landed over here so that should give you kind of a better idea of where this kind of event happened so it is fairly close to where they marked it uh on the map and where they put up that kind of structure there uh and like I said I&#x27;d like to than mik a lant for for that uh and help me figure out the exact location of where it happened uh I also just wanted to briefly mention uh when I was kind of looking into this case I I discovered that some people were using uh the one of the Vall sketches uh to represent a type of uh creature that is kind of found in Inuit and Eskimo Legends and this uh this creature this uh uh entity was described by this Dr Henry rink um and Henry rink was a Danish geologist he&#x27;s considered kind of one of I guess the founders of glaciology and was one of the first people to kind of kind of map the the glacier glaciers on Greenland and uh when he was doing this he was kind of uh doing an ethnographic study of kind of like folklore traditions and legends and stuff of the people uh in the regions and he put out this book uh in one place said 1866 I haven&#x27;t seen it published before 1875 1876 uh and this book called the tales and traditions of the Eskimo with a sketch of their habits uh religion language and other peculiarities and uh in this book he talks about uh these creatures the the in Roat inat uh and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re called they&#x27;re basically a kind of a dwarf and these dwarfs possess a shooting weapon in which they able to point at a creature by merely aiming or pointing at it and this is the balance all image you may recognize from the presentation and this is an image I found attached to a description of of what they&#x27;re calling this crypted or whatever on the internet um and the internet has already taken to calling these uh in gets uh to uh as being aliens actually uh so there&#x27;s already a bit of rewriting history going on there but anyways it&#x27;s very fascinating these creatures have this weapon uh that they&#x27;re able to point and it&#x27;ll basically kill a creature just by pointing at it and uh later on this in the book he uh kind of when he&#x27;s relating the the tale of these in uh he kind of describes the weapon a bit more and uh it&#x27;s a weapon that apparently is fashioned out of this kind of this Willow this tree that they find that kind of looks like a person um and from one of its roots he says they made a weapon not larger in size than a closed fist shaped like a pistol at the end they put a little black stone with a little red one on top of it this instrument when finished they named the pointing weapon and knowing and fearing its killing powers for their own kith and kin they are always said to a carry it in their uh their one hand uh and these uh these inula cats uh I&#x27;m ping that name I&#x27;m sure as well uh supposedly also go on to uh in their travels they meet these kind of uh uh these other kind of entities that uh they say they look like humans but they&#x27;re kind of short but they kind of have do dog like almost kind of like legs and they carry these bow and arrows uh that they uh and these weapons these pointing weapons that they can point and shoot things at and uh they say uh they met with these singular beings whose upper limbs were shaped like human beings but below they were shaped like dogs these creatures were armed with bows and Dreadful behold could catch the SC of a man and be against the wind like an animal one winter they covered the whole inside of their abod underground with a single skin that of a large beast called a kifac kilif uh the one with six legs The Story Goes that when they had eaten the Flesh of the animal the bones were covered a new with the flesh but only up to the sixth time and and remember this because this actually also comes into kind of like their life cycle these these end of these life cycles and how they live to be really old um as kind of a repeat this whole five or six time uh situation it says and despite its strength and size they killed it with this above mentioned pet weapon merely by pointing at it so this weapon you know could take out any size creature like small large it didn&#x27;t seem to matter it was able to completely take out anything just by pointing at it uh and apparently they could also somehow uh kind of warp space almost like they could pull one location closer to them to travel large distances as I said they could diminish the distances from one place or another by drawing the various parts of the country closer and they performed this by kneeling down together and spreading their arms out towards the mountaintops uh but finding some of them too high to spread their arms over their foremost finger cross the already contracted Parts with one long stride and uh the others one by one fall in his tracks some of and some of these people would get left behind like the contraction would happen I guess before they could follow and they&#x27;d get left behind uh anyways they would they traveled a long ways until they finally reached this land and they met some more of these uh they&#x27;re kind of people they&#x27;re the the inir inir cats uh and these these creatures had this other kind of interesting feature that kind of is almost kind of Allison and werson land like with the changing in size and they had these two different suits so they would have these smaller like kind of fitting suits for their natural kind of small miniature dwarf like size but uh they would carry around a second suit which was kind of like a larger kind of man-sized outfit and whenever they needed to like do something like carry heavy loads uh or needed to be larger they would put on this suit and apparently by beating themselves somehow they would reach this larger human size I I don&#x27;t know how that works and and a problem with some of these things is like these people are telling a story and this guy uh uh that collected these ring basically admits that uh his notes were kind of poor and so uh this can be some confusion in parts of these stories but basically supposedly beat themselves that that gets them up to big size human size and when they want to get small again they kind of go to their cave and knock the crown of their head against the top of their cave and that shrinks them back down to their normal size again and uh that&#x27;s and that&#x27;s not actually the kind of the this this kind of Legend of a kind of like a stick that you can point at people um is found also in other um uh Legends uh kind of esimo and kind of native people and in this uh book by Charles Leland uh published in 1884 called The alanin Legends of New England or the Miss and folklore the mcmack the pasati and the panasa tribes uh he he tells this other story of this woman that kind of gets this special stick and on this cover here you can kind of see this cool little guy uh I guess he&#x27;s the the mikum uh which is kind of supposedly some sort of Indian puck or kind of a good fellow kind of like a creature that&#x27;s kind of got some kind of stick and he&#x27;s kind of got this like outfit and whatnot anyways he&#x27;s not doesn&#x27;t necessarily relate to this this kind of Legend here and there&#x27;s a lot of Legends of little people uh uh in you know like native am Native American literature and uh lore and traditions and and he tells this story of uh this this deity kcap which is basically he&#x27;s kind of like this Creator Divinity kind of guy that&#x27;s a trickster kind of kind of God um and there&#x27;s this woman and she&#x27;s had lost her child and uh so I guess she was kind of like alone and this strange boy kind of like comes upon her and decides to start calling her mother and kind of starts treating her as mother and he&#x27;s got this kind of special flute that uh uh when you play it like you can call any kind of animal to you so like they never need food or they need like uh Furs or whatnot they can call animals with it and then like kill kill the animal and uh but he tells her you know don&#x27;t tell anybody about this kind of like magic pipe of ours uh or will starve uh and he says he got it from some other kind of stranger uh and I remember this this kind of being is supposed to be GL glap and and it&#x27;s part of this wider uh pas pas pasi Pas Madi Legend uh where uh it&#x27;s actually kcap that discovered America not Christopher Columbus and it&#x27;s not that he discovered America it&#x27;s that kcap discovered England he traveled the seas in a stone canoe discovered England um and then went to France and because they because of that that&#x27;s how they found out about America and then white man came to America after that and so it it&#x27;s kind of this reverse Legend of how he actually discovered Europe and that tipped him off to America and uh created all the people coming here but so anyways back back to the story here and so he&#x27;s got this mother and and one day he&#x27;s he&#x27;s with this mother his you know adopted mother uh that he&#x27;s playing along with and he&#x27;s making this canoe I&#x27;m talking about and it&#x27;s this Stone canoe and the mother takes his pipe and blows it and she gets a deer and a beaver and uh uh you know she Slaughters him and she collects all these kind of Furs and whatnot and this one Beaver comes has this stick in this mouth and this stick you get this magic stick you point something at it and it will die and so she points at a deer uh and it falls dead now this is an old esimo tale again greatly modernized uh it says the eskimos believe in a kind of Sorcerers of spirits who have these instruments in which they can merely just point at people uh and it will kill them uh and that&#x27;s again what we see in a lot of these kind of dwarf stories and legends um is that uh these creatures uh have these weapons that kind of kind of paralyze you or mobilize or disable you uh in some way and uh uh I will also say just kind of briefly um before uh uh the chat today I discovered in um uh Merc eliad elad&#x27;s book on Shamanism uh he&#x27;s got a a section here uh when talking about uh the shamanic sources of power and how Shaman&#x27;s kind of get their power and he says in North America there are also other sources other those have by Supernatural Aid the idea of a dwarf who grants power or serves as a guardian spirit is extremely widespread west of the Rocky Mountains so um we have a lot of these stories of these kind of little people and even Little Green Men uh in Native American and other indigenous folklore from kind of around around the world uh that I thought was really interesting that kind of seems to match up with some of these kind of humanoid encounters that we see uh I just also wanted to uh one last thing point out I mentioned a case uh last week uh that was kind of also rugby ball described as rugly ball shaped on crutches and uh this was a case in uh uh Nima uh France and it happened on October 14th 1954 and neima is in the south of France it&#x27;s actually about about 100 miles um to the to the west of Valen and so this case took place little bit a little more than 10 years before uh uh and it&#x27;s [Music] that um you&#x27;re cutting up again no I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cutting up bad uh this is my last slide hopefully I can just finish it uh it just says uh a rugby ball on crutches in the sky of nim uh after the orange and red gleams accompanied the packs of flying cigars seen by policemen two residents of the Guard Mr dup and his wife saw last night when going back home at a few kilometers in the north of nime uh greenish gleam in a field they approached it and noted with all the time they needed the presence of an object entirely identical to that of a rugly ball and appearing to rest on crutches suddenly the strange apparatus Rose in the air while emitting a weak noise and gradually taking on an orange color and so this is another case of an object rugly ball sized on crutches in a field emitting a kind of a wine or whistling sound and taken off um that happened 100 miles west of Valena over 10 years before and you know this case isn&#x27;t really that unique [Music] J are we back we&#x27;re back again uh yeah you&#x27;re back you were gone there for a minute yeah I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s just uh Comcast or exfinity or what uh because it&#x27;s yeah sorry about that I I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my computer because I closed everything down I&#x27;m not even running my TV and it&#x27;s not just me it&#x27;s cutting not Rachel too so yeah and maybe it&#x27;s streamyard or something I don&#x27;t know yeah or it could just be it could just all be on my end for all I know right now yeah any anyway that&#x27;s uh that&#x27;s kind of all I had uh yeah it&#x27;s the Men in Black that&#x27;s right they&#x27;re they&#x27;re trying to shut us down well um I didn&#x27;t really uh have anything to add to my story from last time just because I kind of wanted to uh take a break before going all in on the Prairie light rabbit hole but uh yeah um there there is a bunch more material about that about uh I I don&#x27;t know specifically if there&#x27;s uh I do want to find out more about the Sand Creek reports from 193 but like just from the clippings at koufos. org which I think are those George Art&#x27;s clippings I&#x27;m not sure but anyway um there&#x27;s a bunch of other reports like that from the same time period from Kansas yeah in the 1910s so yeah it&#x27;s something I definitely want to learn more about I was also got there a couple other things I forgot to kind of go over last week that I was gonna mention about the valinol case was uh I I didn&#x27;t talk a whole lot about the the actual samples like if there they because they took samples from the ground and there if there was anything different I did show a picture where they mentioned uh the main difference they found was kind of a higher calcium [Music] [Music] cut anyways so uh the other main difference was just uh that and I mentioned this in the chat uh on the kind of the live chat again this week on the replay was that uh the difference in what he reported initially like right after the event to the jeery and what he reported six weeks later in August um initially he didn&#x27;t report anything about being paralyzed or these these entities both being on the ground are pointing this uh weapon at him and paralyzing him his uh initial reports uh were much more basic he he described them as being small like 8-year-old children children but that only one of the beings is on the ground one was in the craft nothing about any sort of weapon or paralyzing him or any of the more that more Fantastical element of the story that was not introduced until six weeks later when he said he finally felt he could tell the full story to the people um so uh again you can take take from that what you will uh maybe he was just kind of nervous about telling the whole story because as he said he didn&#x27;t want to tell the story till later men um he just kind of made normal and so those those are some of the main differences didn&#x27;t really get to address is kind of the evolving nature of the story the debris samples and kind of where the case really went well with it cutting out maybe that&#x27;s about all we can do today maybe uh yeah I feel like those I made some sort of error probably but I don&#x27;t remember what it was I should also mention that Louise is uh has a PhD so I I accidentally refer to him as Mr Lis Kayano I wasn&#x27;t doing that as a slight against him or anything like that it was just an error I should have said Dr Lis Kayano is that what he prefers I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know just because you have a PhD most people don&#x27;t use doctor in front of their name yeah but I mean yeah I don&#x27;t know is that rude to call a doctor mister or something I don&#x27;t know according to UFO like people how dare [Music] you you typically put the PHD part in the actual Source reference that&#x27;s just Style Guidelines like but but UFO Twitter got mad like they&#x27;re trying to take away uh Gary Nolan&#x27;s phds and make him seem like he&#x27;s not a qualified it&#x27;s like no that&#x27;s just how like I know you guys have never actually like written papers before or like know what a source is but that&#x27;s just how you write a source out guys like you don&#x27;t put all those FL the the flattery formal titles like in the source like that&#x27;s just how like it is and yeah yeah anyway um okay yeah that&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s coming to my mind I I also meant uh instead of uh it wasn&#x27;t Crawford sure it was Crawfordsville Indiana um yeah those sightings or those reports from 1891 came [Music] from okay um yeah I think maybe we should just end the show early tonight uh you know as much as I would love to just go on and on about the assap a tip thing I actually do want to read that more closely but I have not had the chance to um uh I&#x27;m I I&#x27;m really uh I you know I skimmed through it and I did find it really interesting um and I want to spend more time with it but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to take me a while to really absorb all of that information I think yeah it&#x27;s a lot of stuff all right sounds good well yeah thanks for joining us yeah we won&#x27;t have an episode next week because next week&#x27;s my birthday so um we&#x27;re postponing it so it&#x27;ll be two weeks two weeks uh yeah and also um I this was never actually explicitly stated on the show but I don&#x27;t think it was anyway uh but just dog Dorothy passed away um and uh just after last week&#x27;s show um not well not just right after but you know like uh the following day um so yep she got sick started getting sick shortly before the episode kind of that&#x27;s why all right black is shutting us down they&#x27;re trying to silence us yeah well anyway I just wanted to offer my condolences yeah thank you everybody for all the kind words I appreciate it yeah um and okay for our final story tonight a red Sprite was shot on camera from space Here&#x27;s a shot of a red Sprite taken by Matthew Dominic from the International Space Station on June 3rd the red Sprite is visible as a series of red streaks above the bright blue light which is is actually a lightning storm
