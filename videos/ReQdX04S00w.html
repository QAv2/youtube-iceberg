            <p>is this major right for you i made a short quiz for computer science i would be okay spending a few hours writing and debugging code every single day i&#x27;m more excited by solving logic puzzles instead of deciphering old literature i&#x27;d be okay with sitting for most of the day and relying more on logic and rationality instead of self-expression i&#x27;m okay with my work being abstract and not really tangible i get excited hearing about new technologies here&#x27;s how you can score the quiz the extended version is in my discord</p>
