            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This video is another in our series on doing things with geometric algebra. And in this video, we introduce part three of a guide to Hestess&#x27;s treatment of constant force motion or projectile motion. It&#x27;s part of his book, New Foundations for Classical Mechanics. And the portion that we are treating is this one. He entitles it constant force.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also constant acceleration. And one of the key features in his treatment is what they call the photograph. And in the previous two parts of this series or of of our guide to Hess&#x27;s treatment, we discussed this photograph at length and how Hess uses it. I will link the previous parts and this new part in the video description. and the previous parts also in the upper right hand corner here.</p>
<p>The striking feature of this third part is Hess&#x27;s use of an extended photograph from which he uh derives or infers geometric insights that he then sheets via geometric algebra. And I&#x27;ll just leave it there and encourage you to check out this new part of the guide and also the previous ones. And I hope also that you&#x27;ll consider joining our LinkedIn group, Preun University Geometric Algebra. Thank you for your time.</p>
