            <p>and again is by Val B almost and again this Lis K kaitano katano the author of that opinion piece for the Scientific American and it does do a really good job of of giving an overview and even a timeline of the history of modern UFO research by the government especially the oap and atip program and again the confusion over what they really were doing and this this weird situation with lu alzando saying he was the head of it but then there being disagreement about that so those are all free to download from academia.edu and like I say are linked to multiple times in this the Scientific American article what really happened at the pentagon&#x27;s once hidden UFO office all right and became aware of this interesting collection of UFO Hotspot data over at betus.com</p>
