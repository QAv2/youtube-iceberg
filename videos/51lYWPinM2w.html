            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello welcome to my channel this is an educational Channel where we review and study up on uh all kinds of different theories mostly theories of everything all-encompassing theories that can have a massive impact on your understanding if you uh tune in and are diligent uh use usually these uh theories are a little bit difficult um you have to apply yourself but the payoff is great so today uh as we have for the previous 204 videos we&#x27;re looking at the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson died back in 1990 but for the 60 years before that he was developing the reciprocal system and the basic idea is that we live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time a motion is basically a fraction that has space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator space and time however can come in three or more Dimensions that is what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time and then um space and time also have their scalar aspect or their clock aspect Lars to cause a clock time in clock space space is a time is always flowing progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later but in no particular direction that is a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but no Direction in the same way there is clock space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction which was actually observed by the Hubble telescope that determined that um all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and that goes uh way back to the 1920s I believe and um then uh space and time also come in only discrete units there is no continuity there space and time come in small chunks and uh one chunk of space in one chunk of time is the speed of light so the speed of light is one basically that means that the speed of light is a midpoint unlike Legacy science where zero would be the midpoint and you would have plus or minus in the reciprocal system we&#x27;re dealing with uh multiple multiplicative inverses and so one is at the center and then greater than one would be two three four five six and less than one would be one half one third one-fourth one-fifth one-sixth um so it&#x27;s when you multiply them you get to one not when you add them you get to one okay and then um we are uh we are looking at Larson&#x27;s book called Nothing But motion and this is a book that&#x27;s primarily on Atomic physics we are in the midst of a pretty difficult chapter here called cosmic ray decay uh cosmic ray is a cosmic atom now when you have uh this speed of light as the midpoint of the universe or the null point or the origin or The Ether or the um neutral point of the universe then you have two separate sectors of the universe the material sector which we&#x27;re familiar with where we have uh coordinate space and clock time and then we have the cosmic sector where everything is moving faster than the speed of light in the material sector everything is moving slower than the speed of light in the cosmic sector everything&#x27;s moving faster than the speed light and we have coordinate time and clock space and uh the rules are the same in both and you can actually extrapolate one to the other by simply inverting the rolls of space and time now uh so that&#x27;s where you get cosmic atoms you have material atoms which are combinations of motions an atom is really a combination of two or three different rotations um that is built upon a photon which is a simple harmonic motion or a wave which is a it in itself a combination of two motions so now what happens with we would not be able to really observe any type of cosmic ray or any type of cosmic atom until it starts impinging upon the material sector so um and this happens also invite in the reverse order of material material atoms going over to the cosmic sector that happens when a star or a Galaxy explodes and the explosion goes beyond the speed of light a powerful explosion and when that happens the atom thrust into the other sector because it crosses the speed of light boundary which is the one that the you know boundary between the two sectors and so when it crosses over it becomes unstable radioactive because it is not built for that environment it has you know your various rotations and vibrations and those are not stable in that environment and in the same way when a cosmic star or a cosmic Galaxy explodes and moves um moves everything past the speed of light boundary then [Music] it moves into the material sector and then we&#x27;re able to begin to observe it and so this is what Larson is talking about when the cosmic with cosmic rays cosmic rays come across the material sector to the material sector and they immediately begin to Decay or they&#x27;re unstable and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re Radioactive um and they change into more stable uh configurations uh and in in the case of cosmic rays they actually change a number of different times into different uh Cosmic atoms until they actually Decay into a material uh atom or a true material particles actually that are massless neutrons so it&#x27;s primarily Cosmic hydrogen and Cosmic helium that come into the material sector and they gradually are quickly decay up the periodic up the cosmic periodic table until they get to a cosmic Krypton and then at Cosmic Krypton it flips and they turn into two massless neutrons Larson goes through this earlier in this chapter right now and so these are what a legacy science called the uh mesons and in particular the piperons um now um when you look at Larson&#x27;s system he basically develops his system uh through Theory only so he has two fundamental postulates we went through the main one of those that has you know the universe is made out of motion motions the relationship between space and time space and time of the coordinate and their their clock aspects and they come in only discrete units the other postulate is mostly having to do with math and geometry and then um he takes those postulates and he derives or deduces a theoretical universe and then he Compares his Universe with the universe that the scientists have observed and measured so his his deductions do not come with labels and so it&#x27;s just a deep okay something like this uh something that fits this description exists um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s up to matching that uh function with a label that the scientists have already arrived at if if any and in this case Larson&#x27;s Cosmic atoms coming into the material sector uh matches with what the scientists call mesons and okay so we will take over here where he&#x27;s talking primarily uh about the Pion which is I think Cosmic silicon 27 no um let&#x27;s see yeah I think that&#x27;s right okay pions are frequently reported as products of observed cosmic ray events initiated by primaries as we will see in the next chapter such production is quite feasible where there is a violent contact of some kind with the release of a large amount of energy but direct production of pions in Decay is not consistent with the Decay pattern as derived from Theory the apparent Direction production direct production is however understandable when the relative lifetimes of the Pion and the earlier Decay products are taken into consideration there is no reason to believe that normal decay in Flight will result in any change of Direction ejection of massless particles will take care of the conservation requirements without the necessity of directional modification because the entire Decay process up to the production of the Pion occupies only a very short time compared to the entire lifetime of the Pion itself it is unlikely that the usual methods methods of observation will be able to distinguish between a Pion and a cosmic particle undergoing a complete Decay to the Pion status in Flight in the kind of a situation mentioned in chapter 14 for instance where a Pion apparently leaves the scene of an event in a continuation of the direction of motion of the primary and carries the bulk of the original energy leading to the conclusion that the primary decayed directly to the Pion there is nothing in the observations that is inconsistent with the theoretical conclusion that during a short interval at the beginning of the motion attributed to the Pion the cosmic particle was actually going through the preceding steps in the Decay sequence the next event in this Decay sequence the decay of the Pion involves an eight unit increment to C Argon 35. again the zero isotope is the stable form this leads to a mass of 106.42 Mega electron volts and a theoretical life equal to that of the Pion The observed particle is the muon with mass of 105.66 Mega electron volts formed by decay of the Pion as required of the theory both the Decay to Cosmic silicon 27 the Pion and the subsequent Decay to C argon 35 the muon continue the same pattern of a uniform one unit increase in the cosmic Mass increment in ex each succeeding event that was followed in the earlier Decay steps but in as much as sea argon is equivalent to helium that&#x27;s where you flip one to get the other um using uh four as the basis of a two-dimensional rotation and so since C argon is equal to 3 is notated by Larson as Cosmic three two zero it&#x27;s uh inverse then would be two 1 0 which is helium which from the material standpoint is only one step away from the neutron that is the end product of the Decay process the following ejection of positive displacement carries the cosmic atom to the final Cosmic structure C Krypton each of the two rotating systems of the C Krypton atom is rotationally equivalent to a neutron and converts to that particle since C Krypton is massless that is its observed mass is merely the mass equivalent of the inverse mass of the cosmic sector the conversion products are massless neutrons or their equivalents pairs of neutrinos and positrons some of the aspects of this conversion process will be given further consideration in chapter 17. unlike the Decay events which involve changes in the atomic structure and therefore do not take place until they must the conversion of the C Krypton rotations to massless neutrons is merely a change in scalar direction to conform with the new environment and it takes place as soon as it can do so consequently the the C Krypton atom as such has a zero lifetime as soon as the particle ejection from C argon takes place the conversion to massless neutrons begins in view of the non-appearance of C Krypton the apparent lifetime of C argon the muon is the sum of its own proper Lifetime and the conversion time the value reported from observation is 2.2 times 10 to the minus 6 seconds a theoretical explanation this value is not yet available but it is probably significant that the difference between this and the life of an uncharged particle moving in one dimension about 10 to the minus 8 seconds is approximately that associated with a gravitational charge the absence of the C Krypton Atom from the Decay process is not due to any abnormal instability of this Cosmic atom itself but to the preference for the alternate scalar direction that prevails in the material environment in the reverse process the directional preference favors the C Krypton atom over the neutron alternate plays a prominent part as we will see in chapter 16. in those cases where the incoming Cosmic atom is not in the normal Decay sequence it ejects enough positive displacement in one or two Decay events to reach one of the POS one of the positions in that sequence after which it follows the normal path in the same manner as the products of the decay of cosmic hydrogen however these heavier elements are beyond the stability limit for two gravitational charges in a low energy environment and consequently they do not form structures analogous to the PSI particles PSI particles this has the in has the effect of increasing the probability that some of the Decay process sorry some of the DK products that normally carry one gravitational charge will occasionally be found in the uncharged condition the one allowable charge would result in an asymmetrical structure during the time that the speed of these particles is in the two-dimensional range and if they are observed at this stage they are likely to be uncharged gravitationally the uncharged lifetime for a particle moving two-dimensionally is approximately one natural unit of time or about 10 to the minus 16 seconds such a life is the most definite indication that an observed particle is in this early stage of the Decay process for example the Ada particle with the observed mass of 549 Mega electron volts and a life of 0.25 times 10 to the minus 16 seconds is probably a gravitationally Charged C beryllium 7 atom which theoretically has a mass of 532 Mega electron volts a more questionable identification equates the row particle rho uh with C lithium five the theoretical mass in this case is 745 Omega electron volts and The observed values range from 750 to 770. the more recent measurements being the higher the row lifetime has been reported as about 10 to the minus 23 seconds but this is too short to be a Decay time it is evidently a fragmentation time a concept will which will be explained in connection with the discussion of particle production in the accelerators both C lithium 5 and C beryllium 7 are in the normal Decay sequence a fact which lends some support to the foregoing identifications the reported observations of particles that are outside the normal Decay sequence will be given some further consideration in the next chapter if the UN incoming Cosmic atom is above C Krypton in the cosmic Atomic Series so that it cannot enter the normal Decay sequence in the manner of the elements of lower atomic number it must nevertheless separate into Parts at the end of the appropriate unit of time and since it cannot eject massless neutrons as the lighter atoms do it fragments into smaller units which then follow the normal Decay path all right well that is the end of chapter 15.</p>
<p>uh if you understood any of that yeah pat yourself on the back uh if not um just listen to me going over the chapter over and over again it&#x27;s probably the last six videos um but I would recommend going back to the start and going through all of it because Larson introduces new terminology I can only imagine how he wrote these chapters it must have taken him forever to write these chapters they have all the information in them and they are I think well written but they just he&#x27;s using so many difficult terms terms that he only knows the meaning of uh so it&#x27;s difficult but hang in there and we&#x27;ll come back tomorrow and go through chapter 16 which is called Cosmic atom building</p>
