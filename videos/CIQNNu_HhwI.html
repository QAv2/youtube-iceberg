            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] [Music] [Music] hey there everybody man it is good to be back yes this is live if uh you haven&#x27;t noticed already this is not a premiere uh originally i was actually going to just do a normal cut video but recently in the last month or two when i have been able to have time to do videos i&#x27;ve been doing these behind the scenes ones and to my surprise and pleasant surprise at that they&#x27;ve been very popular in the sense that i do them live it&#x27;s a little bit raw and then what i do is go back and cut the segment together with a more professional cut intro you know if i stammer or have to put my dog out or whatever in the middle of it cut that out i wasn&#x27;t going to do that for this and in the last 48 hours have seen so much chatter online uh that i decided to just do it live at least this segment so you&#x27;re going to see the full presentation minus that&#x27;s you know 70 90 120 second cut introduction that i do on these types of long form uh uh presentations so i have a powerpoint presentation i&#x27;m gonna just jump right into it uh but i at least wanted to give you guys that introduction for those who have never seen a behind the scenes video that&#x27;s what this is it&#x27;s just raw and it&#x27;s a opportunity for me to you know hang out with you guys and you can see my my stutters and fumbles and all that good stuff live um i have till about 7 7 15 my time that&#x27;s california uh so hopefully i&#x27;ll keep it within those constraints some of you may go wow he&#x27;s gonna go that long there&#x27;s a lot here and and i realized doing this i could make it a lot longer i&#x27;ll go more into detail in the actual uh show but uh it it just came to a point where you will see the type of information that i bring out and kind of go over with you guys it&#x27;s something that i wanted to do for a while but there&#x27;s just so much of it and there&#x27;s a lot that isn&#x27;t in this yet so that being said um i know some of you hate those bars and tones so don&#x27;t worry i&#x27;m not gonna do that but i do have to give myself a little bit of a graphic break so just bear with me here you&#x27;re gonna see just a graphic i&#x27;m on the screen for about 10 seconds again that&#x27;s just for me to get a little bit of an edit point when i drop these videos into edit bays and stuff like that i know it&#x27;s silly but bear with me here all right i&#x27;m just going to go into it that&#x27;s right everybody as always thank you so much for tuning in and making this your podcast or your live stream of choice i&#x27;m your host john greenwald jr founder and creator of theblackvault.com and i know that on this channel i&#x27;ve been a little bit quiet lately for that i do apologize work has been a little bit crazy and sadly that does have to take precedence over what i love doing and that is creating these videos and these types of presentations for all of you now for those who aren&#x27;t aware sometimes i will do behind the scenes videos live now if you&#x27;re watching this live welcome it&#x27;s going to be a lot of fun if you&#x27;re watching the pre-recorded version that drops later that&#x27;s a little bit more professionally edited and cut together just know subscribe to this channel that way you get notified when i do the live streams and you can take part any of those who are currently watching live you may see their questions come in super chats are open it&#x27;s a way to support this channel and it helps me get research like this done it always isn&#x27;t free to start digging into some of this stuff and some of those foia requests do yield some high dollar price tags 100 of what comes in through those super chats go right into this channel and the website to create this type of content so if you do decide to support awesome thank you for that if you can&#x27;t don&#x27;t worry about it everything is still free but the biggest help that you can give is spreading the word now today what i&#x27;m going to be going over is something that has been a hot topic in the ufo world or on twitter as some like to call it hashtag ufo twitter and that is the new book skin walkers at the pentagon now i want to show you guys this because this is a a copy that i purchased i had posted on social media that i recommend if you guys are interested support the authors there may be some stuff that i go over today where you may question the authors uh that&#x27;s healthy i hope that i don&#x27;t offend anybody by questioning some of the information but in the same respect i support published authors and so i&#x27;ve seen a lot of people really start scanning and taking pictures and posting things on social media that includes full chapters and stuff like that i don&#x27;t support that what i do support are taking quotes which is what i&#x27;m gonna do and you may see some some pages from the book just know all of those pages are on the amazon free preview so i am not showing you guys anything you can&#x27;t see for free on amazon&#x27;s free preview but again i want to at least plug that ahead of time that i do recommend buying the book if you want to know the full story that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to get it you&#x27;re not going to get it from me because i don&#x27;t go over everything and you&#x27;re not going to see it on social media plus it&#x27;s not fair so i do want to give my show of support for those authors because what they have done and this is what i want to kind of go over here is essentially bring one man forward that has yet to come forward since december or arguably october of 2017 but since this whole atip story broke now we didn&#x27;t know about asap until a few months thereafter but essentially this was the man dr james lakatsky that ran a another program not atip but asap in the defense intelligence agency he has been mum up until the last few weeks since this book came out so that to me is the biggest revelation from this book because now we&#x27;re getting somebody&#x27;s side that we have never heard before but in that process there has been massive confusion that has reigned not only with the uh last three four years since since the new york times and political bro politico broke the atip story but this doesn&#x27;t help in the sense to clear up all of that confusion i&#x27;m not blaming the book or the authors but rather i&#x27;m showing you guys everything is not cleared up as some want us to believe there are still massive massive amounts of confusion with all of this but then on top of that there are still many questions that have yet to be answered so let me go ahead and bring up the presentation that i want to do for you guys and this will go over why that confusion continues to rain when it comes to assap and atip and why questions continue to linger about awesome atip because i see differing viewpoints here that some want us to believe everything is transparent and has been out there for years there&#x27;s just lazy people out there that don&#x27;t want to look at the facts well i&#x27;m here to tell you i don&#x27;t consider myself lazy i&#x27;m a lot of things as some people will tell you sadly lazy is not one of them i&#x27;d love to put my feet up and and uh not really do anything but rather i dig in and i follow as much as i can about all of this and there is a lot of it so what i want to show you guys today is why that confusion rains and the questions continue to linger so let me go ahead and get my proper powerpoint presentation here give me one second now before i dig into some of that stuff i want to tell you guys a little bit about me personally on how i approach research i would say the criticism that i get i love the praise but i also love the criticism because it helps me become better but one point of criticism that some people don&#x27;t like me over is what they may call the minutia of the stories uh that they feel that i nitpick that i go too far into trying to pick apart what people say or what people do or you know whatever it might be and for me the way that i approach these types of topics and why i disagree with that criticism and and i want to kind of give you guys a a little bit of a visual representation on why i do what i do but how i do what i do and that is why the minutia matters now i look into every topic like a puzzle that&#x27;s how i visualize it in my mind for 25 years i&#x27;ve run the black vault that&#x27;s what i do there are thousands sometimes tens of thousands of pieces of that puzzle and we put it together to create a picture now some people out there and this is this is kind of my i would say point of frustration sometimes and you&#x27;ll see where i do get frustrated on social media is they&#x27;re cool with the outer layers right there they&#x27;re cool putting the puzzle together and if they see that there&#x27;s trees there there&#x27;s some leaves maybe a building back here uh that&#x27;s all that matters to them and and they feel that they have the full picture because what&#x27;s in the middle here you know grass maybe another building who really cares we we have enough of the picture to believe that this is an outdoor scene and that&#x27;s how they approach research well i&#x27;m different i&#x27;ve got to put everything together because when you do and you put every single piece of the puzzle together another one usually emerges a full different perspective of what you thought was there when you just looked at the outer layer it&#x27;s different and those pieces of the puzzle the center the minutia the little details when you start picking apart all of the stories and how everybody talks about this or that when you put it together a lot of times and arguably most of the time you get a completely different picture as what you see here so you don&#x27;t have everything you think one thing you have it all you see something completely different that&#x27;s how i have always approached research and that is what the black vault is all about now credit to this amazing artist oleg shuplayak i probably had that pronounced incorrectly google him he&#x27;s got some awesome stuff uh i created the puzzle out of one of his paintings but again that is the best visualization uh and simplistic way of looking at how i approach research now some of what i go over maybe review for some of you who like me have lived and breathed this since october of 2017. why i say october not december that is when luis elizondo entered the scene that was when he talked about an aerospace threat program that was identifying these types of threats but he never said atip in october that was not broken until december that october press conference by to the stars academy introduced luis elizondo to the world and that was where i became incredibly intrigued about what was rumored to be this secret ufo program fast forward then from october to december of that same year new york times and politico breaks the story december 16 2017 in my opinion will forever change ufology in the sense that it created this firestorm of publicity for this program called atip the reality that unidentified aerial phenomena were being investigated by the us government or at least that&#x27;s what we were told in december and since then a lot of stuff has happened you see that on this channel i try and cover it when i can but also in the mainstream media in the last uh really in the last year and a half especially since that uh uap report uh came out and so that&#x27;s why i say that it will forever change ufology the study of of ufos and and that&#x27;s what these two articles were as we dig deeper and look at the confusion in those questions i&#x27;m going to bring up something that upsets a lot of people and to be quite frank and blunt i those that do get upset that i bring this up i don&#x27;t care and here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s those my my new details the small details and that was what i atip actually stood or stands for uh in that in that new york times article and the politico article we were getting two different names for what atip was so in essence the confusion for those who were paying attention to those small details started on day one now some of you may not think this is a big deal and this is one of those things that again upsets some people that i brought up in the past but continue to make reference to because again this is what started the snowball of confusion it was simple as a single word in the letter excuse me in the acronym of aerospace versus aviation new york times reported advanced aerospace threat identification program politico advanced aviation threat identification program why does that matter it&#x27;s plain and simple it&#x27;s research when you look into something you need those names to be accurate and yes foia offices if you don&#x27;t have keywords right or full names correct there is uh sometimes an issue with that and so yes i brought that up uh quite early on because the pentagon had said it was advanced aviation i don&#x27;t regret that at all pushing that that point and in fact i&#x27;m glad i did because it really brought quite a bit more out about the reality of atip and what it was and according to the government what it wasn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t matter if you believe the government or not it doesn&#x27;t matter if i believe the government or not but the pushing of that brought more details out including how it was funded and i&#x27;ll show you that in a minute but also some other details as well but where it really got worse and dicey was all of these different variations of the name just beyond what politico and new york times had reported but as these stories were being written all sorts of names emerged and what was concerning to me was the accuracy number one but number two how much care was going into vetting these stories what you&#x27;re seeing on screen here the sources the main sources for these articles were the main key players involved in the program so my questions as time went on and this confusion began to really mount was why were there so many variations and why weren&#x27;t anybody really getting it right because all of these couldn&#x27;t be right so why was there this confusion when their sources were those involved was it careless journalism i could buy that was it bad sources i don&#x27;t know but that&#x27;s why these issues were being pushed this was one of the first declassified documents from the intelligence community that i got through foia that in fact uh anybody got through foy this is the first one ever it as well said aviation this comes from a system called intellipedia this is used by the cia the nsa uh all of the different arms of the intelligence community as a whole they use this so again even internally referencing the new york times and the use of of an article that used aerospace they flipped it and said aviation why no one really knows here is the statement i got in february of 2019 it took that long for the dia to finally say uh while it was at dia it was advanced aerospace now again i&#x27;ll say it a thousand times that upsets a lot of people this whole name debate some people say well who really cares my point was starting with all of that is to show you that confusion started on day one and it has not gotten better as it continues with the publishing of this book on top of the publishing of the book they laid in my opinion a bombshell when it comes to critiquing past coverage it&#x27;s one thing for you know peon john greenwald to say it and harp on the new york times or whomever that got it wrong but when the ossap former director who has not been disputed by the pentagon uh when that guy comes out and and authors a book that said unf and i i quote on page 156 for those who have the book unfortunately the a tip details presented in these articles and news programs were actually those of asap and in fact many of those details themselves were in error senator harry reid said himself in the forward to the book on page what is that 24 in roman numerals the new york times article created enormous confusion by mistakenly linking the 22 million dollar funding to the small informal atip initiative the 22 million was specifically targeted only to assap atip as used by the new york times was not asap and asap was not atip the 22 million dollars was contracted through the defense intelligence agency into assap to evaluate the threat potential of uaps not a dollar of that sum went to atip despite widespread statements over the last several years page 160 of the skinwalker&#x27;s book says one of the purposes of this book is to correct the record so they are stating quite simply they want to set the record straight and by doing so they&#x27;re saying pretty much everything that was reported uh was mislabeled and wrong now that&#x27;s those are big claims to make because it wasn&#x27;t just politico and new york times that reported it the avalanche trickled to hundreds and arguably thousands of mainstream media outlets around the world if they were all wrong the question mark is how were they all wrong a lot of them were wrong because i call it copy and paste journalism they were just taking other articles and jumbling the words and making it their own in my opinion this is just an opinion insert graphic you know that says john greenman&#x27;s opinion but i believe that the book is placing blame without placing blame they said on page 156 the main source for the times article was lou elizondo who had recently resigned who had recently uh and i apologize i don&#x27;t know how i uh repeated that uh the main source for the times article was lou elizondo who had recently resigned from his pentagon position and joined ttsa and director of global security and special programs again that was page 156. now remember in the last slide i said that all of the facts that they were saying as reported by the times in those articles were wrong so in essence they&#x27;re saying this was the source so the question mark is how did the source um not convey those facts accurately i&#x27;m not blaming mr elizondo by the way that&#x27;s not what i&#x27;m saying the book is so that&#x27;s what they say in the same section articles were wrong and this was their source they didn&#x27;t name anybody else so was it possible that not one but two articles that broke this story from two major mainstream media outlets both somehow mysteriously got the same facts wrong that doesn&#x27;t make sense to me whatsoever so there&#x27;s a lot of layers to that onion which we you know have yet to see as the story continue to unfold even more confusion came out this was a interview earlier this year from uh with robert bigelow on mystery wire george knapp credit to him for sitting down face to face with robert bigelow and asking him some questions in that interview uh this is one thing robert bigelow said i met lou a couple of times didn&#x27;t uh didn&#x27;t really he didn&#x27;t play a role in our program in any way in terms of who we ever reported to or whoever we discussed kind of things with and then he goes on to talk about james lakatsky not by name but referring to him as the program manager now in this interview it is clear that luis elizondo had no role in ossap and they didn&#x27;t communicate he was not somebody that they ever reported to or whoever we discussed the kinds of things with okay fair point right until you start looking at what other people said to the same journalist this for me is cause to question george knapp in an interview back in 2018 june to be exact he sat down with luis elizondo luis elizondo stated when george knapp asked this interaction between you and your group and the asap bigelow bass folks conversations back and forth you got a general idea what they&#x27;re doing luis elizondo he replies in the affirmative he says of course yeah we didn&#x27;t do anything without talking to each other how do you have those statements from two of these individuals go hand in hand you don&#x27;t one who&#x27;s the billionaire who got the funding from the dia to do their program said luella zondo sure nice guy we never talked lou elizondo says yep we didn&#x27;t do anything without talking to each other those are not small details that is a major conflict of statement between two main players of this story who&#x27;s right and who&#x27;s wrong well we kind of don&#x27;t really know to add even more confusion dr hal put off we know him as being involved on the bass side he was a contractor through bass this was something that he gave to me in june of 2019 this was about the pentagon statement that luis elizondo had no assigned responsibilities on the atip program so i wrote about this extensively some people hate me for some of those articles others i think saw the value of digging in because what happened well we got dr hal put off on the record as he submitted this statement and i&#x27;ll read it in part however i have no problem asserting that as an asap slash atip contractor and senior advisor i continue to attend meetings provide briefings gain access to videos provide proposed program plans meet with staff etc all under the aegis of elizondo&#x27;s leadership and responsibility for maintaining continuity of the program effort and goals until he resigned well that&#x27;s great he&#x27;s now vouching for him the question mark however is that bass&#x27;s contract didn&#x27;t go after 2010. now it could be assumed that dr hal put off stayed on if luis elizondo took over in 2010 and we&#x27;ll go over that timeline in a minute dr hal put off then stayed on as a consultant okay i can see that kind of interesting that bass is cut out but one of their contractors stays in so that&#x27;s interesting how that may have unfolded there&#x27;s a lot of unchartered territory there that i don&#x27;t really see anybody talking about but i responded to dr put off and said hey can you elaborate so are you saying that after 2010 you as either a bass contractor or somebody who what didn&#x27;t work for bass and then later got a contract direct with the pentagon to consult with or do whatever you know could consult with or do whatever duties you had with luis elizondo&#x27;s atip well that could be true as well but james liquatsky said atip was never funded so then the question mark is who wrote dr hal put off statement a paycheck so based on this statement if he stayed on there&#x27;s got to be funding from somewhere i mean in my opinion and i don&#x27;t fault anybody for this you&#x27;re not going to volunteer your time so my guess is who&#x27;s paying and and and that&#x27;s where a lot of the layers when it comes to the pentagon&#x27;s atip side start to come into question because if bass was out how did dr putoff stay in he never responded to my follow-up to try and figure out what happened it only got worse we were told and we were you know shown documentation and i&#x27;ll go over that documentation also in a minute that asap started in 2008 after it was awarded to bass well in a dr hal put off lecture that he gave to a conference in las vegas in june of 2018 he said the following people have trouble trying to get documents out of the pentagon by saying they want all documents on atip and they have a hard time because that wasn&#x27;t the actual name of the program advanced aerospace weapon systems application program is the actual name of the program but atip was the nickname it went by it began in june of 2007. the defense intelligence agency was concerned about the fact that obvious observation had shown that advanced aerospace vehicles crafts or drones of unknown origin were flying all over the united states over waters in fact globally as was the case did you catch it it began in june of 2007.</p>
<p>now that&#x27;s more than a full year prior to money ever being allocated to the asap contract in august of 2008 so what happened there now put a pin in that because when i go over the timeline you&#x27;ll see something else emerge that creates yet another question this was also echoed to george knapp in a mystery wire interview uh by luis elizondo because that really wasn&#x27;t a quote i should say because that really wasn&#x27;t that started before i came on board and therefore my knowledge of it is a bit limited so in essence in 2007 the initial program was called asap program it was that name for about nine months and that program was later refined it was a bit of a shotgun approach to the phenomena so yet again we have a 2007 start date but yet again documentation and all reporting contradicts that now despite the controversy about the pentagon saying no luis elizondo had no assigned responsibility on the atip program let&#x27;s get beyond that and find out when he started now we all know for those who watched the history channel special unidentified they went over a lot of elizondo&#x27;s background and they said the following these are three screenshots with the official transcript uh these were taken uh believe uh through my press access to the history channel where they allowed us to screen ahead of time i did not post these until after the show aired but that&#x27;s kind of the screen you&#x27;re seeing and then since then i believe you can view this publicly or at least you did for a while but anybody can verify this they said in that show which luis elizondo was instrumental in the narrator says in 2009 elizondo took over the 22 million dollar advanced aerospace threat identification program well that&#x27;s entirely wrong across the board based on all of the new details that have emerged uh luis elizondo which you&#x27;ll see in a second says well 2010 the 22 million dollars according to james lickatsky never went to atip so yet again how did a television show that was working directly with the sources get it wildly wrong now maybe the producers just made a mistake and sure we can chalk it up to that but was there something else luis elizondo in one of his interviews said the asap program given the resources 22 million dollars would never be enough to really follow each and every uh down each and every rabbit hole to do this conclusively in my opinion anyways so it was refocused to atip i took over in 2010. so yet another discrepancy on the timeline what is going on all these details by the way do mean an awful lot when you&#x27;re trying to figure out what the right story is that timeline defines money where the money came from who was involved who was calling the shots and let&#x27;s just face it essentially who&#x27;s telling the truth not everybody can be right and all of these little details sure people can get dates wrong uh it was now what 11 going on 12 years ago-ish uh depending upon what version you go for so that&#x27;s cool you know maybe some of these are just all mistakes but you know when you&#x27;re talking about something this sensitive in my opinion uh and again an opinion here that i&#x27;d like to insert we should take a little bit more care again i&#x27;m not saying who&#x27;s right or who&#x27;s wrong in this presentation but rather pointing out the huge discrepancies in the timeline the story the claims the facts and what we&#x27;ve been led to believe in a presentation that was done to mufon uh this was edited to uh down a little bit and put onto to the stars academy of arts and sciences or ttsa&#x27;s youtube channel slides were shown by luis elizondo in one of those slides you&#x27;ll see the highlighted purple one highlight was my emphasis 2008 asap is formally changed to atip by former program manager to focus more narrowly on the five observables and research of advanced physics applications but as we know in the book anyway for those who read it it was only said that it was a nickname that atip was never anything within the dia and that the atip that we know it was an unfunded unofficial and the they used the word unofficial program operated out of the pentagon so what happened in 2008 according to mr elizondo two full years or at least close to two years prior to him taking over that atip had already been morphed and uh used to to focus in on these five observables that is not checking out with the new information that has come forward in 2009 this kind of reinforces that in 2008 a transfer to atip or a formal repackaging so to speak likely didn&#x27;t take place excuse me in 2009 this harry reid letter uh was written essentially trying to get sap access or special access program status for what we refer to as atip but in the book it kind of shows that this was an introduction of the atip word that this was an unclassified way of referring to assap which essentially took the spotlight off of this program that they wanted to remain secret and essentially created a nickname they said in the book and again this is from the free preview based on preliminary data a letter had already been sent from senator harry reid to deputy secretary of defense william lynn on june 24 2009 requesting a sap or special access program for ossap as detailed in chapter 10 the decision to create the sap was postponed but the urgent need persisted oddly enough the primary legacy of the letter was the new unclassified nickname the advanced aerospace threat identification program or atip created exclusively for use within the unclassified letter the atip acronym was adopted much later to describe a small unofficial effort within the dod to investigate uaps encountered by the military the new york times article in december of 2017 mistakenly linked the 22 million dollar in funding to atip not asap assap was the change asap was the official name of the 22 million dollar program and was never changed a tip was not a funded program now that&#x27;s completely contradictory to what we&#x27;ve been told about how asap morphed to atip in 2008 well the book is completely contradicting that narrative and it isn&#x27;t right what&#x27;s interesting to point out about harry reid is the shifting of viewpoints when it comes to this because in 2009 he had said in his letter that he had seen enough to try and get what he was referring to as atip a sap status but years later he did an interview and a journalist asked him were you ever briefed on the findings of of of the program and were you staying involved uh in the new york magazine article published in march of 2018 the journalist says when the program was running was this something that you would be briefed on frequently were you briefed on it ever harry reid said no i left everybody alone nope journalists followed up you were never briefed harry reid says that that&#x27;s not my style nope how is it that you as a senator would essentially go and fight for sap status on something which by the way i cannot find any example outside of this storyline of a sitting u.s senator getting involved in a program that&#x27;s already underway trying to request certain status in this in this manner that doesn&#x27;t mean that it hasn&#x27;t happened that&#x27;s just kind of unorthodox once funding goes senators aren&#x27;t generally involved in the day-to-day business of dia or nsa or cia or dod or whomever so the fact that he was involved shows you that there was something else going on he had obviously been briefed enough which by the way i don&#x27;t think i pulled it but there&#x27;s a quote about them briefing harry reid in the book i think so you know it it shows that what version of his story do you want to believe because as time goes on we&#x27;re getting more and more information that is simply creating more and more confusion and generating more and more questions than it is answers in a mystery wire interview again credit to george knapp yes the name a tip and this is from james lickatsky quote yes the name atip was a nickname for asap for certain security reasons that we&#x27;ve put into the book but the difference between asap with the nickname atip at dia and a tip at the pentagon is quite distinct ossap had 22 million in funding it covered military and civilian ufos yielding a massive database it also had a main contract and subcontracts now a tip in the pentagon as described in the articles was basically zero-funded looked at specific military ufo encounters and very important ones because they had film and it had no contract so getting back to how did this mix-up occur i think it&#x27;s not deliberate it&#x27;s not due to authors to television personalities etc it&#x27;s the fact that we were running not an official app but a closed program and he goes on and on so is who&#x27;s to blame for the confusion i&#x27;m not really sure but when you talk about the key players involved none of them agree either so we can talk about the media in one breath and that&#x27;s fine i&#x27;ve done that on this channel before and have made extensive videos about the horrible um the the the horrible reporting when it comes to this topic but now when you look at the actual statements from everybody and the story lines and and what comes out in books like this and you know rumor has it there&#x27;s more books coming when you look at all of that and nothing matches up what are we as the general public led to believe about this was this all kosher and up and up and that brings me to my next section which really upsets some people but it is something that truly puts all of this into context now for many years i&#x27;ve talked about the concept of a sweetheart deal now essentially in plain english what i mean by that is the fact that that asap was a creation for bass to get x amount of dollars in the tunes of tens of millions if not a lot more i don&#x27;t believe that 22 million dollars was supposed to be a cap but tens of millions of dollars in a program that was catered for robert bigelow and bass now that happens in government and military so i&#x27;m sorry it just happens right it&#x27;s not something that i like or dislike but it&#x27;s the reality of what&#x27;s going on but it also puts into proper context what it is that we&#x27;re actually dealing with and what it is that we&#x27;re actually talking about now one of the main things on why i get attached to this is a lot of you who are watching this are into ufos and you know me as somebody who loves the topic and i do i preface a lot of what i do with saying i believe the phenomena is real i believe it warrants scientific scrutiny i believe funding should be put forward to look into it and i fully support the uap task force and its mission to try and uncover what all this is but in the same respect i am a researcher and an investigator who has dug in for decades through the freedom of information act on information that goes well beyond ufos and where i uh want to bring this up is this is a crossroads for me because i take personal biases or i try i&#x27;m only human of course i&#x27;m going to have you know something in it that that is within me that makes me lean a certain way but i truly try hard uh not to do that and this is a crossroads for me because i want all of this to be real and i look into it for the reason that i believe that there&#x27;s something to the ufo topic but in the same respect i look into a lot of government waste and wasteful spending and through the years have gotten you know quite a few different news agencies and media outlets to cover documents that i&#x27;ve come out with on various topics a prime example was years ago quite a few years with one of those stimulus packages how they spent 18 million dollars for the recovery.gov website like how does a website cost 18 million dollars and for it to be a disaster propublica also had a lawsuit to get a lot of that stuff out so so credit to them as well involved in those stories 16.7 million dollars for canned pork and so i&#x27;ve got the fda contract on all of that craziness 1.5 million dollars for cheese and and it goes on and on so that&#x27;s what i do and this is where the concept of a sweetheart deal whether or not it deals with ufos or not comes into play for me because that&#x27;s who i am as a researcher and somebody who looks into these topics and looks at a 22 million dollar dollar sign and whether or not this truly was appropriated properly and what if that 22 million dollars went to the you know let&#x27;s say office of naval intelligence for the uap task force or wherever could that have been appropriated more properly where they don&#x27;t focus on let&#x27;s say cryptozoology stuff and and cryptids and dino beavers and some other stuff that that that i can&#x27;t say without laughing that rather if you focused on the nuts and bolts aspect of this phenomena that we know is real what could that 22 million dollars have purchased elsewhere so that&#x27;s that crossroads for me but i want to deal a little bit with that sweetheart deal narrative because for years i&#x27;ve talked about it as a possibility and you know what with the with the publishing of of this book uh and now james lickatsky on the record truly not third hand information but his words in a book with his name on it i believe now it&#x27;s solidified solidified that it is a sweetheart deal does that take away from results before i dig into this no of course not where are the results is the question so even though i don&#x27;t believe that it takes away from the results my big question is where are those results and if there was something yielded from the 22 million dollars where is it and if it&#x27;s classified and heavily classified at that then they wouldn&#x27;t be talking about asap and atip and writing books about it because the idea concepts and these findings and realities of dino beavers and man-like wolves or whatever that if that all happened you&#x27;re not going to be able to talk about that if it&#x27;s highly classified so if it is unclassified and they&#x27;re able to talk about it where are the results and that is one of the biggest questions that we still have yet to answer when we get into this concept of a sweetheart deal because if this was truly a sweetheart deal and the money was catered for robert bigelow and he doesn&#x27;t want to share it i&#x27;m not not saying that that&#x27;s the reality but where is everything if that is the reality then we have a lot more questions than even i thought about this whole thing so anyway concept of a sweetheart deal so these are some of the the facts that we&#x27;ve learned here uh in the last few years and some with this book as well we know that robert bigelow this man over here owns bigelow aerospace and who created the subsidiary that we know as bass as the one that got this contract we know that senator harry reid is instrumental in that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s really kind of no debating that robert bigelow&#x27;s headquarters is in nevada and when this man senator harry reid uh was the majority leader and and uh was in the senate he was in so for the state of nevada so these guys were obviously in the same state and with the success of a billionaire who creates jobs and creates uh money flowing into that state this man here is obviously very happy so there is motivation for the one to take care of the other now the other two gentlemen that don&#x27;t get mentioned a whole lot uh and we just hear again third hand information would be senators ted stevens and daniel anyway both of which are the late they have both passed away so that&#x27;s why i say most of what we hear is all third-hand information and we don&#x27;t really know the role i&#x27;m sorry if any that they really played in getting that we just have to believe and and trust uh the book itself we&#x27;ve learned that harry reid&#x27;s connection to robert bigelow goes back to the ned&#x27;s days back to 1996 when reid had attended one of the board meetings for nids and he was very impressed by it lots of scientists lots of uh you know big names uh not the the tinfoil hat people that i&#x27;m sure most politicians are scared of these were big people that apparently is the root of harry reid&#x27;s interest in robert bigelow nids all things ufos paranormal skinwalker ranch and and it&#x27;s rooted back uh to 1996 now we know the connection then between robert bigelow and harry reid extended far beyond uh friendship they were also in the tunes of thousands of dollars worth of donations from not only robert bigelow but also his late wife diane bigelow all under the banners a lot of times under the bigelow companies uh bigelow development aerospace llc and it probably extends farther beyond this i just don&#x27;t know all the names of everybody but these are all verifiable contributions all through um 2004 a little bit before then a couple years later asap was awarded and then these thousands of dollars of donations from robert bigelow ironically around the time that they were saying that they were cutting the assap funding uh which is um you know probably just a coincidence but obviously again a a relationship that extends far beyond the professions or or just a friendship that there were thousands of dollars in donations that were going forward enter james lakotsky he again was the dia scientist he was a rocket scientist who in the leaked reports that&#x27;s really how we knew his name before but nobody wanted to say his name he was on the leaked reports as being the asap program manager and so that also was a cause for confusion hey what about mr elizondo didn&#x27;t he wasn&#x27;t he the manager what is this and uh in the early days that really caused a lot of confusion since then we got clarity that uh mr elizondo said hey we uh two different programs he led us excuse me a tip uh elizondo led a tip in the pentagon lakatsky was awesome at the dia dr lakotsky says the following on page 20 for those who have the book reading hunt for the skinwalker which is by the way the original book that was written by george knapp and i think colm kelleher as well about skinwalker ranch created quite a bit of hoopla many many years ago so back to the quote i&#x27;m sorry reading hunt for the skinwalker back in march of 2007 intrigued lakatsky i read the book cover to cover lakatsky says i was legitimately interested in this as useful to the military and useful to my particular group which was looking at possible threats to new weapons systems that&#x27;s what attracted my attention so that kind of gives a time frame march of 2007. lakatsky gets a personal interest into skinwalker ranch specifically this ranch in utah that allegedly has all of this paranormal activity there&#x27;s a little flow chart for you in 2007 this is from senator harry reid by the way page what is that 14 uh in the roman numeral in 2007 i received a telephone call from bob bigelow regarding a letter he had received from the defense intelligence agency or dia that also time stamps it that lakatsky writes robert bigelow and says i want to visit skinwalker ranch bigelow immediately turns around and calls his buddy harry reid to kind of have everything checked out as the story slash legend goes if you want to call it that lakatsky visits the the um skinwalker ranch and actually has which he recounts in the book a paranormal experience and he&#x27;s convinced at this point that money needs to go to this research now again keep in mind that this is 2007 according to the book enter harry reid ted stevens daniel anyway that they according to senator harry reid on page 16 in the roman numeral quote thus the advanced aerospace weapon system applications program was conceived senators stevens inuit and i allocated 22 million dollars to get the program started a government request for re proposal was put out and bob bigelow&#x27;s company secured the bid that was the 22 million dollars that went to bass according to the pentagon this is how it was funded the program commenced in fiscal year 2008 with 10 million dollars appropriated in the defense supplemental appropriation act the first 26 reports were complete completed by late 2009 the defense appropriation act for fiscal year 2010 included an additional 12 million dollars for the program and 12 additional reports were produced that&#x27;s quoted from susan goff pentagon spokesperson that culminated from dia statements and so on and so forth i&#x27;m putting her name because that was the last time i received a version of it uh but james kudla from dia also gave me portions of that even goes back to audreisha harris from the pentagon in early 2018 when i was communicating with her back then senator harry reid also on page 16 as the united states senate majority leader i decided to meet in a classified location in the united states capitol with two key members of the appropriations process the two members of the appropriations committee who controlled the dark money the non-public money were republican senator ted stevens of alaska and democratic senator dan inyue of hawaii now bringing up this because dark money has come up that the phrasing dark money has come up quite a few times when it comes to harry reid and to be blatantly honest with you and i could be completely off base or missing something big i have no idea what in the hell he&#x27;s referring to when you talk about black budget programs sure i i obviously know what he&#x27;s referring to dark money is something different and really doesn&#x27;t have to do with government spending but rather corporations namely non-profit corporations and how they donate to political campaigns ironically one of the biggest outspoken senators on dark money was senator harry reid himself these two articles i pulled from various years 2014 and 2015 harry reid says dark money and campaigns threatens democracy another headline harry reid joins call for obama to take action on dark money now i don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;s using the right phrasing and it completely contradicts the pentagon and what they are documenting in these fiscal year acts and the appropriations bills on what senator harry reid is doing so i&#x27;m not sure what he&#x27;s referring to if there&#x27;s something i&#x27;m missing please guys help me out uh i believe that maybe he&#x27;s just erroneously referring to black budget money um but even that doesn&#x27;t make sense because according to the pentagon they fully admit the money was on the books and they show where it came from on top of that senator harry reid in this book said that he and the two other senators allocated 22 million dollars well i would politely argue that was impossible for him to do he could get the original money or put it in a bill somehow but there was no cap if you look at the documentation of what assap was all about it was supposed to extend far beyond two years maybe even to five years and beyond but after a review in 2009 after the dia had started it they felt they were not getting anything beneficial so then the funding was cut after that second year george knapp was the one that showed screenshots of the first contract that was signed for that first year the total amount 10 million dollars it coincides with what the pentagon says there&#x27;s in my opinion no way that senator harry reid then could understand number one that they would get a second year because it was an option but number two that it would be for the total of 12 million so senator harry reid or in my opinion any senator for that matter or committee or whatever in 2008 or excuse me 2007 i think he said in the book uh they couldn&#x27;t allocate 22 million dollars because the bills weren&#x27;t even written yet and that money that came from those bills wasn&#x27;t even determined yet so for that whole portion of the story and i know it sometimes gets dicey and confusing when you start talking about this level stuff it shows that i believe senator harry reid is wrong and i&#x27;m sorry his use of the word dark money makes no sense to this story but he&#x27;s used that so many times i had to point it out and on top of that senator reid was against the true definition of dark money as a whole going back to the idea of that that sweetheart deal we know from a statement that i got back in march of 2019 that there was only one bidder on this contract that could have potentially equaled tens of millions of dollars should the option go to five years and beyond the fact that no other contractor would try and bid on a public notice in 2008 doesn&#x27;t make really any sense now some have argued that that&#x27;s normal and that&#x27;s fine okay so let&#x27;s get beyond it i won&#x27;t i won&#x27;t beat the dead horse but bigelow aerospace was the only bitter that has never been disputed it was reported however erroneously that lockheed put a bid in that also was wrong senator harry reid has said in interviews that he uh put the bid solution or excuse me that the government put the bid solicitation out and that bass got it because they were the most qualified at the time he never said they were the only one so what are the odds that this bid solicitation which i&#x27;ll show you here called the advanced aerospace weapon system applications program goes out for public bids and nowhere nowhere in that public bid solicitation as skinwalker ranch mentioned or excuse me or ufos or paranormal mentioned which would make skinwalker ranch incredibly valuable to bid on a contract like that saying hey if you want to look in the paranormal we have the prime spot for you or whatever none of that was in the public bid solicitation so what are the odds that out of all of those corporations llcs or whomever is cleared to bid on a contract the one person that actually bids on it strikes the jackpot because its ceo robert bigelow has this invested interest in ufos and paranormal so we&#x27;re led to believe that asap when it went out withheld some of those other details from the public bid notice because some have argued they were classified others say that they were embarrassed by it yeah pick your explanation doesn&#x27;t matter but man did robert bigelow hit the jackpot when he just got lucky and was the only bitter that allowed him to do paranormal fun house research or was he tipped off now let&#x27;s face it he was tipped off you can&#x27;t get around that if if we want to believe otherwise that&#x27;s fine but there&#x27;s no way that a dia scientist a year prior that then a year prior to this contract being awarded calls robert bigelow wants to go to skinwalker ranch has a paranormal experience comes back sets the the deals in motion to get word to harry reid 22 million dollars comes out of nowhere and boom this goes out for a public bid and voila bass is the only bitter no the reality is he was tipped off and this was catered to him another thing emerged too while looking at this book and kind of going over the documentation again this is a copy of version number three of the official notice for bid solution solicitations why i say version three is there are three versions not a whole lot of difference it changed a couple little details but it really didn&#x27;t change the scope of the of the program they just save all the revisions online on theblackvault.com search the search engine for awesapp you will be able to download all of the different versions i have everything archived but while doing this presentation this was the date that you&#x27;ll notice here solicitation issue date august 18 2008 that&#x27;s when it went out that is when uh the dia said hey we want solicitations for this bid the due date was september 5th so pretty tight you didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to submit for this bid uh arguable on whether or not that&#x27;s standard or not but uh irrelevant for for my presentation here so we&#x27;ll just call it september 5th those dates are also backed up by sam.gov or which is now the find business opportunities website believe sam.gov has been rebranded but this is the archived version so september 5th was the due date and of course other websites as well all archives all verify september 5th was the due date now why do i say that well because um the book has september 10th uh so that could just be a typo but then in the appendix on page 184 they talk about the proposals that bass submitted to the defense intelligence agency saying hey look we&#x27;re the guy for you they were submitted three days after the the due date uh what happened there not really sure but it&#x27;s a discrepancy worth noting because well the due date was done so if nobody else was there what happened i i don&#x27;t know i really don&#x27;t have an answer to it uh but it&#x27;s important nonetheless this was the statement of objectives this was the essentially what ossap was all about this also is from that version three document no mention of paranormal no mention of you know ufos or or or anything in that genre uh it was all about looking at advanced uh aerospace technology and forward looking into the 40 years into the future uh looking at various lift propulsion uh so on and so forth on how things uh essentially could progress and that&#x27;s what this was supposedly all about in that same document from the get-go the program manager or the contracting officer was dr james lickatsky the same guy that visited skinwalker ranch and reached out to bigelow aerospace the year prior so you know it seems like it was kind of set up and in the book goes into even more detail about how dr lykotsky was instrumental in that so if we haven&#x27;t really figured out that this was catered for bass and robert bigelow yet i&#x27;m not sure how else to put it but this book solidifies that fact now here&#x27;s kind of a timeline of events some points are review some points are new but this is how it all unfolded march of 2007 likkatsky read hunt for the skinwalker the next month lakoski meets in the defense warning office with jonathan axelrod believed to be just a nickname to talk about tales of the paranormal he is within the the dwo was within the dia or defense intelligence agency axelrod takes the book to iraq while deployed somehow that you know gets the ball in motion that all of this was uh you know real june 19 2007 likkatsky writes to robert bigelow on dia letterhead to ask to visit his ranch now remember when i told you to put a pin in that doctor put off uh quote and then later elizondo had a 2007 start date for awesome that was all june of 2007 when they said that it started so is this the start of ossap did they did they already start putting money towards bigelow did they already choose him why are multiple key players involved saying 2007 contract wasn&#x27;t awarded until more than a year later and according to you know reports they weren&#x27;t aware of it they were just the lucky bitter so how did all that happen and how is it connected not really sure but it was an interesting date correlation when going through the book the next month july 26 2007 the cats came bigelow fly to utah to visit his ranch within 60 minutes of being on the property litkatsky had paranormal experiences seeing quote unearthly technological device that had quote silently appeared out of nowhere in the adjacent kitchen it looked to be a complex semi-opaque yellowish tubular structure that&#x27;s page 39 and 40 for those who have the book in 2007 as well but it&#x27;s an unknown month but we know that it&#x27;s post likatsky&#x27;s ranch visit bigelow briefed long-term friend as the book calls him senator harry reid on extraordinary history of uaps at the uap at the utah ranch excuse me as well on the recent astounding experience by a high-level dia analyst on the same ranch it did not take long to connect jim lakatsky with senators daniel inyoway of hawaii and ted stevens of alaska in a capitol building meeting january of 2008 i tracked down the documentations the the documentation from the nevada secretary of state that shows that bigelow aerospace advanced space studies or bas as it was formed as a domestic limited liability company in nevada it was reported as well bass was set up only for osap the asap contract if that&#x27;s the case seems like he had prior knowledge if that&#x27;s not the case heck of a coincidence august 2008 asap bid solicitation notice is published in the biz ops website september 5th asap bids were due september 8th vast proposal volumes 1 through 3 were submitted and september 22nd 2008 the asap contract was issued to bass i know i spent a lot of time on the sweetheart deal but that frames what we are dealing with and in my book absolutely closes the deal uh when it comes to the sweetheart deal argument does that negate the findings no but where are the findings and that question still lingers to this day those findings could be in the reports that a lot of people are now referring to james lakatsky&#x27;s chapter in chapter three of the book voluminous high quality material more than a hundred separate reports as detailed in appendix one was submitted to the dia in just over two years of the program&#x27;s existence in addition the 11 databases within the asap bas data warehouse were delivered to dia while the massive holdings of the original analyst journals data and photographs remained in storage now those databases i&#x27;ll talk about in a couple of minutes but we have yet to refer to them in this presentation in short bass is said to have created 11 different databases all encompassing uf uap ufo events witness testimony all sorts of material that&#x27;s what those 11 databases are but don&#x27;t worry i&#x27;ll get to those a lot of those reports are probably spelled out in that original bid solicitation notice so a lot of it i&#x27;m not sure is it being framed to be much more interesting than it is these types of reports like you know management plans for different tasks travel reports expenses so on and so forth all due for contracts like this but is that what he&#x27;s talking about with the hundreds of reports i don&#x27;t really know because the only thing we do know came through a freedom of information act request i did and i know that the federal um federation excuse me of american scientists or or fas uh steven aftergood to be uh precise they as well had a case ongoing as did i for uh the and i&#x27;ll read it here all communications to and from the dia with the armed services committee in 2017 and in 2018 regarding the advanced aviation and at this time when i filed that&#x27;s how the government referred to it uh advanced aviation threat identification program or referred to as the advanced aerospace threat identification program or referred to as the advanced aerospace threat and identification program that was harry reid&#x27;s version the result was a letter that was written to john mccain uh in january of 2018 and this is where we discovered the reality of the durd reports and those durd reports were the 38 reports that were created under the assap contract now i&#x27;m going to read to you part of this letter because one word is key based on interest from your staff regarding the dia&#x27;s role in atip please find attached a list of all products produced under the atip contract for dia to publish the purpose of atip was to investigate foreign advanced aerospace weapon threats from the present out to the next 40 years and again we know 38 reports were given i dug it up in the congressional record log also in april of 2018 they also punched the uh published word a letter from the chief congressional relations division defense intelligence agency dod transmitting a list of all products produced under the advanced aerospace threat and identification program contract for the dia to publish to the committee of on armed services so i was able to kind of dig up that this letter was referred to in official congressional record they received these three pages which listed all 38 reports so that is a breakdown of the published reports through atip notice how the letter didn&#x27;t say asap now why not if atip was just a nickname when it came to dia on paper that meant nothing to really anybody um when it came to funding to a senator and so on so is this the same thing that they&#x27;re trying to keep it secret or is there another layer here that we haven&#x27;t really understood but asap was not involved it should be noted however that this does kind of coincide with the pentagon&#x27;s explanation that atip was the overall program and the portion that was contracted out was known as asap now according to lukatsky uh ossap was the program atip was kind of a nickname and then when you talked to luis elizondo asap was a dia program and atip was a dod program um you know quite a few different definitions dr hal put off also just calls it a nickname so who do you believe on that one not really sure but there&#x27;s a lot of question marks here just kind of a quick side note about some history here ossap as a whole as a program looking at forward looking technology and what might be there isn&#x27;t anything new i had dug up this program from 1972 called project outgrowth it was headed by a franklin b mead and run through the air force rocket propulsion laboratory in essence they were looking at major propulsion developments that may occur in the next 30 to 40 years it was a forward-looking program very much like asap and essentially what they were looking for were advancements in propulsion one of the same exact angles of study for ossep and how it may progress over the next 30 to 40 years ironically asap was labeled as through the next 40 years do the math from 1972 you&#x27;re looking at about 35 years or so after project outgrowth that asap was essentially conceived and borne out so it&#x27;s a very interesting maybe just a coincidence correlation that this program preceded ossap was very much looking at very similar things and had a very similar time frame of 40 years looking into the future you&#x27;ll see number nine here in the 1970s program was looking at actually how you can propel a ship using your mind or psychokinesis they labeled it as movement of objects by mental forces although recent developments indicate small objects may be propelled by this technique too much basic research is needed before this method can be considered for propulsion applications so they were looking at incredibly fringe areas of science as well and so now that the pentagon has kind of revamped their statement did did bigelow insert ufos in very much a similar fashion and then that&#x27;s where the confusion comes from or was this that sweetheart deal and it was something else entirely on paper it was yeah let&#x27;s do some research into lift and propulsion and so on and so forth uh materials and and uh whatever the other 38 dirt reports are but in reality all that money went to paranormal you know cryptid research which is bizarre uh a lot of you asked about dr um eric davis today and whether or not you know he&#x27;s he really briefed in a classified setting about off-world vehicles i&#x27;ll deal with that in a second but one interesting thing when when looking at project outgrowth and franklin mead as i told you about this is how tightly niched these these scientists and this research is and this may mean absolutely nothing but i kind of found it a little bit fascinating that this these documents and programs were separated by decades and decades yet when you start digging in here is a ball lightning study that was awarded to warp drive metrics that is the company for this man here dr eric davis now we know that he wrote five of those durd reports i showed you all 38 he had written five of them he was contracted by his pal dr hal put off and for an untold amount of money and he authored these five uh durd reports what&#x27;s interesting about this ball lightning study though this was outside of awesome so had nothing to do with that was written in 2003 but was really interesting was the project manager on eric davis&#x27;s ball lightning study which was franklin meet the same guy that did that asap like program decades prior and in fact if you continue to dig you&#x27;ll see that eric davis and franklin mead then later would author a document together about laser-like craft propulsion now all of this is well over my head when it comes to science but very interesting that number 31 on the 38 list was about laser light craft technology authored by dr eric davis so you can see how tightly niched all of these people and these realms of research really were and when you dig you see that they really are connected in the most bizarre way now back to your questions about did he brief congress about off-world vehicles now for those who aren&#x27;t aware i did a full video about off-world vehicle technology and the claims made by the new york times and that horrific journalism job uh that was later corrected on numerous fronts they also made corrections that they never noted i go through that in the video and i&#x27;ll be honest with you i do not believe the claims by eric davis that he briefed uh in a classified setting or otherwise about off-world vehicles he may have had a meeting he may have sat with a senator congressman house of representatives whomever uh committee even and and maybe had a meeting i don&#x27;t buy that it was a class of in a classified setting and i don&#x27;t buy that he was really driving the point home about quote-unquote off-world vehicles simply put the existence of off-world vehicles would be a highly classified piece of knowledge we all know that there&#x27;s no getting away from it if it wasn&#x27;t an ace a tip or awesapp or whatever really did find it and it was unclassified in nature you better bet your bottom dollar that robert bigelow luis elizondo james lakatsky or any one of those players would have talked about it and confirmed it by now but they haven&#x27;t all we get are these shrouded convoluted cloak and dagger type you know fun stories that may allude to it but we never get the confirmation so let&#x27;s say it really does exist the government military has off-world vehicles well let&#x27;s face it it would be highly classified and no they would not be talking about it or publishing it in the new york times and the mess that became of that article with all of the corrections i think we can all dismiss the notion and no i don&#x27;t believe dr eric davis is as connected as some people want us to believe i wanted to address that though because of so many questions i got today on social media about it those 11 databases that were created this is one of the last things that i&#x27;m going to go over for you guys and timing wise it&#x27;s working out pretty perfect the data warehouse that they created these 11 databases again was a culmination of ufo sightings and witness testimony hopefully you know photos videos whatever they may be but just it sounds like a massive amount of data now where is that data according to the book they turned at least part of it over to the dia but the question mark is where is it now is it classified and if it is how can you classify something that came from the general public which is what dr lakatsky said they were looking into so if i take a picture or video of a ufo and it&#x27;s not a top-secret aircraft it is not taken by classified technology and i am nowhere near a government or military uh uh either employee or enlistee uh can they classify it and then the question from or excuse me i think the answer to that question would be no so the now the question is where is all that data and we have absolutely no idea i was unaware and maybe i just missed it that the number of databases totaled 11. i was only aware of one and the one database or at least the start of the database anyway that i was well aware of that really i don&#x27;t see enough people talking about is the mufon database that that has collected for decades upon decades uh material and and sightings and photos and videos and so on and so forth witness testimony but on top of that their personal and confidential information all went into this massive database that was purchased by robert bigelow back around the 2008-2009 time frame in fact the actual contract that uh bigelow and mufon signed with each other has no mention of a government program or defense intelligence agency or so on all we learned from the leak of this contract by a mufon member the late elaine douglas she brought this out in january of 2011 prior to ever knowing about asap or atip or bass being involved with the government we learned that it was for the sum of 672 000 that mufon got in made payable in 12 installments of 56 000 that that is what robert bigelow got into now uh i i want to point out because there&#x27;s a lot to this story and i&#x27;m not going to go into all of it for a couple different reasons but i will point you to this website here by roger glassell and kirk collins i believe it&#x27;s kurt&#x27;s website but the article itself the pentagon ufo programs secret partner they both authored that and that is at blueblurrylines.com look it up they do a lot of research and a big deep dive into it i am not going to do the same i&#x27;m just going to brush the surface and ask you guys a couple of questions because i think a lot of people are really not dealing with this now we made uh we were all kind of made aware of this in 2009 and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s kind of a blurry picture this is the best image i can find of it this much younger and skinnier version of myself i was the emcee of mufon&#x27;s international symposium for about a decade at the time this man here was uh james carrion he was the international director of mufon and here we have robert bigelow now we know robert bigelow had invested into mufon in turn they created i believe this was the origin of their star team but essentially they were looking for when those ufo reports came in and the photos the videos whatever and they went into mufon which was the number one place for people to report guess who had first dibs on him robert bigelow but what was not known to the general public at the time was that it was just being funneled right back in to the defense intelligence agency a military-run intelligence agency so that is one of the biggest aspects to this story that i think we should start pushing on that how can a military arm of our intelligence community the dia want to get into watching what united states citizens see then keeping that information but never informing the general public how much of this gets into very dicey areas and my first guess would be a lot of it yet i don&#x27;t see a whole lot of people talking about this and to me i will i will just pose this question did the dia even want this if this was not part of ossap then what problems does this create that taxpayer money through a private corporation acquired all of that personal information now this gentleman right here james carrion who i&#x27;ve known for many many years wrote a big expose on this that has since been removed but you can find it here if you&#x27;re watching the video on this internet archive link follow the magic thread was his blog strange bedfellows was the article here&#x27;s two things that he wrote mr bigelow did not fund mufon&#x27;s work for bass instead quote sponsors that bigelow revealed to john schussler who&#x27;s the one of the founders of mufon but not to other mufon board members put up the money that sponsor the defense intelligence agency so is this alleging that the dia again that intelligence arm of the united states military put money in to purchase all of that information and if so what ramifications could occur from that another thing you wrote during the project mufon provided both historical mufon files as well as current move on case files including witness information to pass to cover mufon legally the mufon ufo reporting form was modified to collect the witnesses permission to offer their citing data to a third party the only third party being bas but what happened before that modification took place all of those other people who felt that government bad i see ufo i go to mufon because they&#x27;re good all of a sudden just had all of their information taken and given right to the united states government how is any of that kosher or okay and what makes sense is that the government would not do this because another big problem about all of this is that none of it fits into the purview of the defense intelligence agency&#x27;s mission when you look at what the dia does they don&#x27;t investigate u.s properties in utah that allege paranormal activity because that&#x27;s not what they do they&#x27;re an intelligence arm that provides mostly foreign intelligence on different types of countries and so on and so forth so why would they care about this now if they argued that it was the fbi a domestic law enforcement agency and they tied in potential uh criminal activity uh that that in turn kind of researched some of that paranormal activity okay i can see that but that&#x27;s not the story this is a military intelligence arm that again is the dia i don&#x27;t want to go farther than that to be blatantly honest because there&#x27;s way too much that you can get into about the purchasing of united states citizen information in relation to ufos and uaps and what they thought was a confidential submission to a corporation known as mufon i will let all of you start asking those questions but i hope with what this presentation showed you is that there is a lot of unanswered questions and i didn&#x27;t even scratch the surface you can look at the statements interviews and so on of quite a few of these key players and you can see how the stories have shifted over time i call it like a fine wine in some areas the stories get better with age so what&#x27;s going on why why are we going through this now some i saw somebody mention on twitter today why does it matter at this point you know we&#x27;ve got the uap task force and they&#x27;re looking at ufos and all of that is good and you know what that part is good and if this is what um this has has kind of morphed into then great i i love that the task force is there the phenomena deserves that scrutiny and funding as i said but in the same respect we have to look at the root of all of this and we have to look at what really have we been told in the last few years and how not only this book but simple research and looking into the claims by many of these people makes a lot of this fall apart some of it our dead horses that we&#x27;ve beat for a couple years now will probably never have answers other parts of this stems from the publishing of this book and the revelation by a new voice an old name but a new voice that is now in the ring and some of the claims he has made really throw a lot of this for the loop for a loop and so when we look at all of that in the end we have more questions than answers we have no idea what that program discovered because in this book i don&#x27;t have any i didn&#x27;t see any scientific test results that shows that the dia shows a dna evidence of a dyno beaver or the fact that there&#x27;s some kind of portal within skinwalker ranch or that uf ufos and uaps are miraculously skirting all of our coastal defense lines and somehow appearing over this ranch i don&#x27;t see that i see a lot of speculation i see some great scientists who are a heck of a lot smarter than me but where are the results because if the united states taxpayer funded this those results are ours and they&#x27;re ours to share and nobody owns them this was a contract asap was a contract not a grant and with that being said there&#x27;s no rhyme or reason if it&#x27;s not classified and it&#x27;s not a a breach of personal confidential information that we should not see it so this is what in my opinion should happen next we need somebody that is intimately involved in this to say that the results are classified the results and if they can&#x27;t say that why not because if they truly are that classified we wouldn&#x27;t have ever heard about asap or atip and that is proven by history over time that highly classified programs whether it be stealth technology drones whatever the mere existence of a program that encompasses top secret technology classified technology or whatever the mere existence of it is classified you wouldn&#x27;t be talking about it so what is it we need more clarity and at this point i don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s telling the truth or not i know who returns my phone calls i know who is nice but that doesn&#x27;t make them honest but i know who is nice i know who i found common ground with and i know who dodges me i believe that these types of questions that i put forward here in the last whatever it&#x27;s been uh hour and a half or so these types of questions have to be answered this is not as clear-cut as some people want us to believe this is not as kosher as some people want us to believe and it&#x27;s not as clean as some people want us to believe it is a mess and it&#x27;s a mess because of the main people and players involved that have come out with their respective stories and the fact that none of them align that they all have contradicting information and again some of those are dead horses i&#x27;ve beat for quite some time and some of this is new but it hasn&#x27;t gone away but i fall back on that one point that i&#x27;ll punch one more time before i say goodnight and that is if the united states taxpayer funded this then the results are ours and if somebody wants to say those results are there but are classified then let&#x27;s get together work as a team and try and band together and get those results out if there are no results then it was a waste of 22 million dollars because they were running around looking at dino beavers and um man like wolves or whatever else that all could be very cool stuff and i love that but it&#x27;s not dia money it&#x27;s just not that would be better served with let&#x27;s say the national science foundation or somewhere else and that portion of the research should there be anything to be bore out should be through those agencies and scientific findings should be shared with the general public but instead we get these cloak and dagger type stories convoluted statements and very few people want to talk but when they do talk they only talk to a very few people and it ends up being a mess in the end anyway so that to me is why with ossaf and atip confusion reigns and com and questions still linger and until we get some of those answers and until some people want to talk none of this is going away and more i believe will come out and arise i will say this one last time buy it i i do believe that everybody should have all the information possible i only scratched the surface but i hope that this motivates other people to not be afraid to ask questions and in the last 48 hours of the recording of this video i&#x27;ve seen some big players and big names essentially harp on people like myself and others who are asking questions well you know what i&#x27;m a united states taxpayer and i deserve to know the answers if it&#x27;s not classified or doesn&#x27;t encroach on somebody&#x27;s personal confidential information other than that i believe we all should have the answers to this and that is why i do what i do is to get those answers i hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for sticking around i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll do a live ask me anything ama video soon but for now this is john greenwald jr signing off and we&#x27;ll see you next time</p>
