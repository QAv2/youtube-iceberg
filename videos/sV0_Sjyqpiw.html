            <p>consciousness can exist independent of what created the consciousness in the first place whether that consciousness goes on to another place you know we can all read the books about the monroe institute for instance you know this notion that there&#x27;s people have out-of-body experiences have you ever had one i had one i remember uh waking up and i was in the middle of nowhere like stars and i go oh my god i&#x27;m in space how am i going to get home then there was like one star that was brighter than all of the others i said oh that must be my star i just felt this rushing feeling and i literally remember coming down through the trees through the roof and then into me then i woke up it could be just a dream but it&#x27;s the most unusual dream that i ever had that had a sense of reality i mean most dreams i forget well that sounds like maybe like an astral projection i don&#x27;t know what it was but i found it fascinating</p>
