            <p>[Music] UFO whistleblower David grosh has come forward stating that he believes the United States government is planning to leak his medical records regarding his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly to discredit him in a statement grush has said the mental health struggles of the U.S military and intelligence Community is a broad issue that is very close to my heart and I believe it should be discussed in an open environment due to the stigmas associated with the subject it has come to my attention that The Intercept intends to publish an article about two incidents in 2014 and 2018 that highlight previous struggles I had with post-traumatic stress disorder grief and depression part of the statement continued like many veterans I struggled after returning home from Afghanistan furthermore I was personally affected again years later when a close friend of mine who was serving in Air Force Special Operations can command at the time took his own life shortly after we last spoke investigative journalist Ross kohlhardt who interviewed Rush when he originally came forward with the allegations that the United States government has possessed non-human craft discussed what he knows about the matter involving the medical records on Chris Cuomo&#x27;s show last night let&#x27;s watch earlier today David grush received an approach from a news magazine an online news magazine called The Intercept they&#x27;re doing their jobs that&#x27;s fine they&#x27;ve been fed information the problem is the information that they&#x27;ve been fed is information that David had already privately disclosed to us and actually volunteered in his interview with me it was a section of the interview that didn&#x27;t go to where but basically he discussed with us when I asked him whether there was any dirt that anybody could drag out to try to discredit him he barely thought this was worth mentioning but he acknowledged that he&#x27;d suffered from PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder when he returned from Afghanistan uh David served his country honorably and with distinction he&#x27;s a decorated officer and unfortunately when he came back from Afghanistan like a lot of men in your country and in mine he struggled with the Demons of what he&#x27;d seen in combat and at one time he wouldn&#x27;t mind me telling you this he was suicidal and his lovely wife was so concerned about him that at one stage she did call the police because there were guns in the house and she wanted to make sure he was protected and in the end David was taken to a local hospital given the treatment that he needed and indeed this is the most important thing Chris the intelligence community and the defense department clearly accepted that there was no issue because he was allowed to keep his security clearance and he continued to serve his country honorably we reached out to the intercept for comment but have not heard back yet um is this material information was that yeah do you think we&#x27;ll talk about the ethics of sure of the government allegedly choosing to disclose this Private health information but is it even a material whether or not he experienced moment of suicidal ideation or was hospitalized for a period of time or suffers from depression or PTSD things like that right um I I think it&#x27;s it doesn&#x27;t seem super relevant to me the longer I think about it depression post-traumatic stress disorder I mean if it was if it was schizophrenia or mental illness of that nature seeing hearing things that aren&#x27;t there then I think we would say yes it is relevant well there are post-traumatic stress disorder can present in people thinking they&#x27;re still in Wartime setting confusing noises for bombs and other kind of you know things like that that we don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s the case presumably if the intercept does release this uh article later this week then we&#x27;ll find out more about specifically what happened of course the version that we just heard is them trying to get out ahead of the story and presenting it in a you know palatable manner but it is possible you know if it does come out that he has at other points in his life suffered from any kind of hallucination or Distortion of reality would that change for you whether or not this was material yeah I mean I I have to say and I don&#x27;t like saying this because it does feel like an effort to smear or discredit him including it especially by whatever if it is the case that military sources or government sources leaked this that is just shocking and unconscionable disgusting Behavior I just I think it sucks I really do yeah that that said it&#x27;s not this is I think this is a hard case it&#x27;s it&#x27;s clearly not totally irrelevant or totally unrelated um but also people should you know we still we can take people seriously even if they&#x27;ve had a mental health episode or a depressive episode in their past that doesn&#x27;t discredit them at all that is many Americans have have had that especially who&#x27;ve gone through combat who&#x27;ve gone through such a trying and traumatizing thing so I don&#x27;t at all want to get to the place or leave people with the impression that that voids the things that he&#x27;s saying or that that makes the people who go through that in general are not trustworthy I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at all it sounds like it would have been beneficial frankly given that um according to coldheart grosh told him about some of that and then they didn&#x27;t that wasn&#x27;t in the interview it might have been beneficial honestly to to have him you know it sounds like he was willing to do that it sounds like he was willing to straightforwardly address that and note that and I think that might have been a good way to go instead of having it come out like this yeah but obviously there&#x27;s no one is obligated to disclose you know their medical past yeah I wonder if they did record that section of their conversation and if releasing it now would also help I mean this also I think raises some interesting questions about the uh the status of leakers in the government I at other moments of leaking scandals whether it was the young man on was it Reddit or Discord who earlier this year had leaked tyshera yes exactly whether or not it&#x27;s someone like Julian Assange or Chelsea Manning Etc there is this posture when the information is reflects poorly on our government&#x27;s behavior that they need the book thrown at them that they need to be thrown in jail that it is the worst violation possible and our media tends to go along with that when the leak is the normal kind of leak that frequently happens where the government is feeding stories to the media the way that some people thought that some of the Nordstrom coverage was the government&#x27;s story that was being offered up to places like the New York Times were part of printing them without much pushback or consideration then that of course is permissible and allowed and so now in this case if it is in fact true the government is leaking information to discredit the public interest in UFOs and the testimony that&#x27;s coming out where people are corroborating having personally seen and experienced UFOs aliens seeing spacecraft Etc then this is another reason that we should not especially credit the the country&#x27;s hand ringing when it comes to the importance of leaks and stopping leaks and of preserving confidentiality yes well Cole hard also weighed in on the journalistic process he understands to be behind the release of the medical information about Crush there was in the documents that were prepared at the time there was a thing called a temporary detention order which transferred him to a medical psychiatric unit an impatient program where he got the treatment that he needed and this is a document that would be if the media had done the right thing it would be in his Police Department file in the file in the county sheriff&#x27;s office but Dave has checked today because he assumed that the journalist had done his homework and just asked the local sheriff for the files the sheriff has confirmed it did not come from him the only other place that had this information is the intelligence community Dave&#x27;s personal files inside the intelligence Community where quite properly When anybody is security assist things like this have to be looked at and so that&#x27;s the best side the intelligence Community leaked it that&#x27;s the crumb Trail um you know the intercept is an interesting outlet for them to go to um after all their protection of Snowden uh it&#x27;s interesting that they would want to have anything to do uh with anything seen as negative now I have two problems with this story one is uh that if you&#x27;re trying to fight transparency by smearing the guy uh who lit the fire for it one it&#x27;s too late because the horse is out of the barn and we want to know no matter what happens uh to grush with all due respect but the second one is that somebody thought that playing with his mental health would be a way to discredit him which is playing into one of the ugliest stigmas in our society make of the point about The Intercept I&#x27;m not sure I quite followed What Cuomo was going going after there I think he was saying that the intercept is a publication that is all about um or that is in favor of government transparency I mean obviously we&#x27;ve featured a lot of people on this show from The Intercept Ryan Grimm used to co-host the show with me for a period of time he&#x27;s affiliated with the intercept um I worked there you worked there right you worked there it&#x27;s a a it&#x27;s a I think it&#x27;s a I think he was saying he considers it to be an open-minded place so maybe a place where it would that wouldn&#x27;t want to Tamp down on speculation about government transparency publishes leakers I mean that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s most known for for publishing classes leakers who are bringing information about what the government is keeping secret from you in this case this is a leaker again to Cuomo is not wrong to smear and discredit a person seeking government disclosure of government yeah well they haven&#x27;t published anything yet so we&#x27;ll see how the characters but it also does seem like as we discussed depending on the nature of the disclosure potentially relevant to what&#x27;s going on here now I I do think that it&#x27;s the the the argument that because he was able to keep his classified status might suggest that there was there&#x27;s no there there I would like to know a little bit more about the circumstances under which the military strips people of of um classified status whether or not having Middle episodes you see Oppenheimer yet this is a major plot point in the movement I have not seen off the camera yet uh yeah yeah it&#x27;s uh that actually does come up um and in that context it was unfairly being stripped of him due to um unfair associations with the Communist Party from much much much much much earlier in his career so I think the intercept like you would more expect the intercept to maybe if this story had appeared in different Outlet to go after it with the angle of the military industrial complex is trying to smear David grush and leak this information sure and maybe male who knows how they&#x27;ll characterize it maybe in fact they will say we release this information likely with the intent to smear him but here&#x27;s some additional content I know this one is a little tough um I don&#x27;t think we like have a right or something to know about every single person&#x27;s history with medical stuff and mental health stuff and it shouldn&#x27;t we should never be putting those people down or rendering them untrustworthy however I because these are very um very sensitive very consequential claims that he&#x27;s being made about crafts and recovered bodies Pilots of non-human non-earth crafts those are incredible claims that we obviously want to hear more about and I I I guess I understand some why some people would think that information is relevant even though I really don&#x27;t like the tactic of smearing someone in this way awesome and also the of the again intelligence people operating to just protect this Secret the the timing of this is also interesting my understanding is that gresh made these claims a long time ago he&#x27;s been he&#x27;s talking about this for quite some time did this uh alleged incident happen prior to him having viewed the egg-shaped crafts during his flight in the sky you know if he gave contemporaneous reports describing what he had seen how relevant is it that later he might have suffered some mental health issues that may or may not have involved any negative um impact his ability to perceive things accurately we don&#x27;t know any of that so I&#x27;m looking for I&#x27;m actually looking forward to but I think it will be helpful to all involved to get more clarification following the story&#x27;s actual publication and we&#x27;ll definitely tell you what we discover when that happens more Rising after this oh [Music]</p>
