            <p>hey how&#x27;s it going today&#x27;s 25th of August Sunday and we are taking a look at the market what kind of opportunities we can find since Sunday I thought might be interested uh thing to do uh would be taking a look at some of the Articles we&#x27;re going to be taking a look at us we&#x27;re going to be looking at Wikipedia I&#x27;m trying to understand what this invention secrecy act 1951 we&#x27;re going to be Tak look at inflation UK and uh how things are going in UK I guess since inflation I would say it&#x27;s m but eitherway and something that was leased by the sky new thought we can&#x27;t touch on it and some of that data which potentially we be Tak a look at inflation and uh what is been published to not reflect what&#x27;s really happening right so that&#x27;s kind of troubling right when it comes to government and how information has been presented to the public by the government right from there we can take a look at perhaps invention secret act and all the half of England owned by less than 1% of the population right have read this article I thought might be important it&#x27;s was published uh five years ago we can we can start with this article and from there we can progress and take a look at us uh which uh might be the structure of this video half of England is owned by less than 1% of its population according to new data Shar with the guard that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m taking SLE from right that&#x27;s uh 62 penetrate the SEC uh secret secret that has traditionally surrounded land own so the entire sector might be very complex but either way we&#x27;re going to be taking a look at Secrets the findings described as astronomically unequal uh which is always good I suggest that about 25,000 landowners Ty members of aristocracy and corporations have control of half of the country the figure shows that if the land were distributed evenly across England&#x27;s population each person will have just over half an acre and are roughly half a size of a parliament Square in central London so this is how much land potentially all the people would own right the figure shows that if the land were distributed okay major owner includes okay there&#x27;s the names there what land has long been uh concentrated in the hands of a small number of owners precise information about property ownership has been notoriously hard to access but combination of the development of digital maps and all data as well as the pressures from campaigners had made it possible to assemble the shocking statistics I I don&#x27;t know what either way so some of that information was published some time ago right and uh perhaps a lot of changes have happened way uh the book findings are drawn from combination of public Maps data relases throughout the Federation Freedom of Information Act and other sources right uh but again sometimes uh Freedom of Information Act do not apply to some documents right so either way the sharol estimate that arist gen Tre the loan around 30% of England this may even be under statement yeah of course it&#x27;s way higher as owners of 17% of England and Wells remain UND this closed and all UND declared the land registry the most likely owners of the since the way how they can structure some of these contracts and all this kind of or ownership and who&#x27;s paying taxes all those kind of things so there might be a reasons right why they would structure that in very particular way since many people perhaps would jump under the car and L to Su the person so there&#x27;s I have save mechanism isn&#x27;t there uh well what all kind of people up there right not that I&#x27;m would recommend anyone to do go to extremes right uh shil estimate that 18% of England is owned by Corporation some of them based overseas or in offshore jurisdictions he had based this calculation of a spreadsheet of land owned by register companies so this is what we&#x27;re looking for potentially uh not people directly but the companies and then even there might be a lot of reasons why uh and how a lot of contracts might structure in this particular way so I don&#x27;t want to go too much in detail as well as this information was published by years ago and a lot of numbers have changed if anything land ownership and if we take a look at inflation perhaps where you investing your money right perhaps we can bring more attention to uh potentially we Tak a look at uh businesses uh business owners and uh investors right A lot of people might be considering in investing you know purchasing land as well as uh then taking look at establishing a business and different ideas and how that can work that would the invention secury Act is something that act provides uh for the withholding of certain patterns that might be detrim to the National Security and other purposes other purposes basically economic purpose is candy or it could be whatever reason fill in a blank so we can potentially purchase B right if you feel like it then hold them instead of perhaps using those patents uh put things into perspective if you were to build a car and that car would be powered by water it&#x27;s something that was done previously in us and according to invention secrety act they they don&#x27;t really need to release that car to the public since that would be some of those governments would have economic percussions of a lot of invested interest in keeping things in the way how they are ideas restricted by invention secur act orders can be prohibited from the public disclosure so you can if you were all your ideas were to be uh prohibited you can even talk about those ideas right Sals uh to the party except the United States uh military industry or exports to other nations can be prohibited and can even be sealed from the public as classied right so there perhaps even if we take a look at perhaps in history just try to imagine how many uh inventions were to be hidden under this act right and appeals are limited to United States Federal agency that itself restricts the ideas the United States patent and trademark office has investigated the possibility of restricting new technologies and those new ideas may be disruptive to extincting existing Industries and or make some of those existing Industries extinct right like oil perhaps which some of those governments have built upon the invention secury act has been criticized for a lack of oversight and impact on the future scientific research by inventors industry attorneys and all academics right so for I have to bring more attention to this kind of uh things that are the mechanisms called right that could limit uh progression and uh for special interest be uh thanks for watching see you next one</p>
