            <p>in 1996 a utah ranch owner told a local newspaper that he and his family were being harassed by ufos nevada millionaire named robert bigelow reads this article and then buys the ranch bigelow brings in a team of scientists to investigate however in the first few years after bigelow purchased the ranch no ufos were seen or reported and in 2004 bigelow shut down his team&#x27;s investigation due to a complete absence of paranormal activity but the following year in 2005 hunt for the skinwalker was published written by two bigelow associates the book claims the ranch was actually crawling with monsters ufos and poltergeists the stories are shocking and frightening they&#x27;re just that stories the book contains no evidence to back up any of the paranormal claims and one of the books authors would later admit that there&#x27;s no evidence if you&#x27;re looking for physical evidence and solid proof and they don&#x27;t happen then in 2007 a scientist at the defense intelligence agency read hunt for the skinwalker he was captivated and he believed the stories could actually be true what happens is a scientist at the defense intelligence agency named james lecatsky reads this book james lickatsky at the dia reads this book is shocked and he writes robert bigelow a letter i in my capacity as a dia official want to visit your ranch he goes to the ranch with robert bigelow and sees something himself has an experience he sees in in the kitchen what i guess you could only describe us as some sort of form some some shape you know some weird translucent kind of phenomena right in front of him in the room and even robert bigelow the seasoned believer or you know somebody who i think we&#x27;d all say i want to believe and does believe he doesn&#x27;t see it but lukatsky the government the intelligence community scientist he says that he saw this thing and the nearest estimate of what this thing looked like is the if you look at the cover of the old mike oldfield album tubular bells a structure like that now likatsky goes back to dc bigelow a long time friend of senator harry reid a long time friend and financial supporter of senator harry reid contacts harry reid and says hey this dia guy is interested in the ranch reed then meets with james liquatsky because of that meeting it is decided that you know reid decides something needs to be done about this we should investigate this officially we should officially investigate the phenomena at skin walker ranch working with senator reid james lekatsky would then write the scope and objectives of an official pentagon program called the advanced aerospace weapons systems application program or awsap according to reed lakatsky intentionally left out any mentions of ufos skinwalker ranch or anything paranormal because of this asap appeared to just be a normal aerospace technology program senator reid acquired 22 million dollars to fund the program the asap contract was then put out in the public domain for solicitation according to the law any company could bid on it and the company with the best proposal would win the contract you would think military contractors energy contractors technology contractors would eat this up it&#x27;s millions of dollars they want us to study technology or military stuff oh we&#x27;re perfect for that we&#x27;ll bid on that another company oh that&#x27;s perfect for us we&#x27;ll bid on the energy company says that&#x27;s perfect for us we&#x27;re gonna bid on that how many companies bid on this one company bid on that who owned that company robert bigelow the asap contract in the 22 million dollars was indeed awarded to the sole bidder robert bigelow and his new company bigelow aerospace advanced space studies or bass supported by government money in a government contract bass would spend the next two years not just hunting ufos around the world but also chasing monsters and ghosts at skinwalker ranch much of this story has not been covered in the press and there&#x27;s a reason for that for a full analysis of ossap bass and how the media has gotten the entire ufo story wrong please watch our previous episode where we lay this all out in this episode we&#x27;re going to focus on what bass claims occurred at skinwalker ranch and how they conducted their asap investigations for years james lakatsky the pentagon director of the awsap program remained a mystery he did no interviews with the press he released no statements then in october 2021 he finally stepped out of the shadows to tell his story lickatsky teamed up with the authors of the first skinwalker book cone kelleher the bass project manager and george knapp a journalist and close bigelow associate together they wrote and released a new book titled skinwalkers at the pentagon they claim the book tells the true story of the pentagon&#x27;s assap program and reveals what 22 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent on [Music] in the new book the same spooky things from the first book return werewolves ghosts bigfoot and of course flying saucers but this time in the sequel a new sinister force arises one of the most striking jaw-dropping allegations they make about what happened at skinwalker ranch this phenomena is this malevolent evil poltergeist that affects the health you know affects people&#x27;s health their immune system and attacks you a poltergeist presence that follows people from the ranch to their homes in whatever state the hitchhiker the hitchhikers they&#x27;re called they call them the hitchhiker these hitchhiking poltergeists that follow you wherever you go and harm you you know there&#x27;s a story of a guy goes home from skimwalker and it&#x27;s attacking his son it&#x27;s affecting his wife and they refer to it as like an infectious agent they refer to this poltergeist as as like a pathogen uh almost and you know they right here infectious agent model and then they bring up kovid 19. just this is from the book just as the wuhan institute of virology or the wet markets in china may have been the source of kova 19 could skinwalker ranch be the source of an infectious agent and they&#x27;re comparing it to covet nick if you were to experience an outbreak of something something&#x27;s happening there appears to be an outbreak of some sort who are you contacting i&#x27;m calling the cdc i called the cdc i called the cdc they don&#x27;t know what the hell i&#x27;m talking about when it comes to skinwalker no one&#x27;s ever picked up the phone and called the cdc you call the cdc you don&#x27;t write a book for 1995. you don&#x27;t write a book to say there&#x27;s an infectious agent affecting the health of people they&#x27;re talking about infections transmissible outbreak you don&#x27;t call the cdc you don&#x27;t pick up the phone it&#x27;s a perfectly legitimate point i agree with you on it i think the the covet 19 analogy was unfortunate to say the least and yeah i go back to my point if if there is data um you know relating to to some sort of pathogen um they write it up for a peer-reviewed medical journal uh yeah or as you say go go to the cdc call 9-1-1 if it&#x27;s harming human beings and literally in here someone&#x27;s i went home and hurt my son if it is real make it real sound the alarms the the logic makes no sense if outbreak equals call cdc is a very basic line of logic and that apparently doesn&#x27;t happen here no it doesn&#x27;t and and that is a big problem in terms of evidence as i say i think it&#x27;s unfortunate i think it&#x27;s meant more as analogy some people go to the ranch and see nothing some people have an experience some people apparently take something back with them but but then you get into a whole another debate about individual perception or some people if there is a phenomenon whatever the true nature of this phenomenon are some people able to perceive it while others can&#x27;t one thing&#x27;s for sure one group of people who are not able to perceive the phenomena are the readers of this book which again contains no visual evidence to support any of these supposed paranormal encounters which is a shame because the skinwalker investigators say they had a variety of cameras with them when they stumbled upon the book&#x27;s now most infamous cryptid monster the dino beaver and they literally write in the book we set out with all of our scientific gear but especially our cameras we took our cameras with us and our so he literally writes our sole purpose was to capture visual [Music] and then like a page later they&#x27;re like and then the cryptid monster showed up [Music] and then the cryptid monster showed up and then they write about this thing and they&#x27;re like oh my god and then like the next page was like oh god damn it we forgot to take a picture obviously they were in shock the skinwalker investigators described the creature as being the size of a large pig with dinosaur-like spines on its back and a very large flattened beaver tail they say the monster was ambling towards them ambling means to walk at a slow pace it&#x27;s not like it zipped by them too fast they say they had cameras yet no one takes a photo these are the worst scientists in the world i am not saying this by the way yeah i&#x27;m not saying this is what happened but i will just pull out from the ufo literature some reports which which i have come across myself of ufo witnesses who literally have a camera around their neck see a huge ufo up close and personal and either because they are in shock or because and this is deep conspiracy but there is some sort of spooky extraterrestrial mind control device that prevents us taking good photos no that&#x27;s not true that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening at all and the difference is nick is that they these are a group of scientists who literally said we went out expecting to see we went out prepared to see we went out with the goal to see and capture an image of this thing and then they see it and then they&#x27;re like god damn it we forgot to get a picture if if there is some sort of either extraterrestrial or phenomenological thing that means that witnesses are affected in some way it&#x27;s going to work on scientists too a week after the dinosaur beaver sighting one of the same investigators encountered a gigantic bird that looked like an oversized owl which literally attacked her car the authors state the attack left scrapes and gouges in the paint of her car no visual evidence of the scratched car is provided month later the same investigator claims a poltergeist threw two wine bottles across a room smashing them against a wall no visual evidence of the broken bottles is provided and later the same investigator claims to have seen spooky orbs of light in her home and black shadow-like figures in her room again no evidence but how does one prove that i mean if you&#x27;re a paranormal investigator and spooky events keep happening in your home wouldn&#x27;t you do what the people in paranormal activity did which is set up cameras literally everywhere but of course this never happens and the reader is provided with nothing but words on a page [Music] and while the words and stories seem like a thrilling adventure the stories not included in the book shed some light on what was going on behind the scenes researcher mark zuccotti released this article featuring on record statements from former employees who worked for bigelow at skidwalker i also spoke to some of these sources who worked as security officers and investigators at the ranch their testimony is that bigelow did not like asking them what happened today or what happened this week and hearing nothing or not much he would get frustrated and angry and these are people who are collecting a paycheck you know that this is their job and the boss has established he&#x27;s happy when weird stuff happens and only when weird stuff happens and so an exact quote from an ex-employee is just tell him what he wants to hear when he asks what happened just tell him what he wants to hear i i&#x27;ve certainly heard the skeptical argument that yeah if there is a billionaire funding research who you know believes in ufos and the paranormal you don&#x27;t want to be the one who turns around and says to him you know what there&#x27;s nothing here yeah yeah you don&#x27;t want to be the guy to tell the billionaire that there&#x27;s not he&#x27;s wasting his money because then he pulls the plug right and you&#x27;re out of a job bigelow&#x27;s headquarters was in las vegas 400 miles from skinwalker and he would only rarely visit the ranch himself full-time workers at the ranch say they were supposed to fax daily reports to him but according to those who worked at the ranch 24 7 a lot of those reports were embellished or simply not true they claim one individual while drunk would make up spooky stories and fax them to bigelow stories such as witnessing a man turn into a wolf [Music] we had a few people who tried to make stuff up in order to please mr bigelow i remember hearing rumors when i was first hired that a bonus would be given out if anyone provided actual evidence to an event this of course created a problem yes some people embellish stories [Music] they never attempted to debunk anything ever they would see a goddamn raccoon and assume it&#x27;s paranormal [Music] everything and i mean everything had a logical rational reasonable explanation that mr bigelow just didn&#x27;t want to hear about [Music] this very questionable scientific investigation was not limited to those who worked at skinwalker ranch in 2010 the university of nevada las vegas printed an announcement in their newsletter declaring a former collaboration between the university&#x27;s nuclear materials group and bass via colm kelleher bass would send various materials to the university and dr thomas hartman would analyze them in 2020 dr hartman went on the record to researcher mark zuccotti about what kinds of materials he was getting from dr kelleher and what it was that dr kalaher was hoping to find dr hartman says kelleher was looking for aliens the basic idea of colm kalaher was to identify traces of alien life so he provided us with some spheres which turned out to be ion exchange beads or a rock sample with traces of hydraulic fluid which didn&#x27;t turn out alien as well further we analyzed some brown liquid in a plastic bottle but it was just muddy water i hope this provides some ideas about the level of research mr kelleher was addressing us with i agree that this is not much scientific so this is a another insight into the level in my opinion amateur hour level of scientific rigidity at skinwalker ranch a collection of random stuff sending it pro bono to a science professor who then in turn delegates it to his students he they were analyzing these materials and they were rocks creek water mud pieces of burnt wood but in according to comb kelleher and those at skinwalker they thought it could be alien stuff stuff from aliens in column kelliha&#x27;s defense i would say if he genuinely believes this is alien um isn&#x27;t sending it for scientific analysis exactly the right thing to do no well you send it to a a professor a professor will often delegate to students i mean they&#x27;re still following the same method i don&#x27;t think you can fault colin kalaher for saying i think i&#x27;ve found something interesting i&#x27;ll get some scientists to test it muddy water rocks and burnt wood that you think someone says i think this might be alien i&#x27;m looking for evidence of of extraterrestrial origins here can you test this creek water and i think it&#x27;s couched in that mystique of skinwalker if you are a believer in that already that this is a hot spot for paranormal activity you already have the notion that if you find something curious at the ranch that it&#x27;s going to have something paranormal to do with it there is no doubt that colm kelleher already believes in the poltergeist stuff in the wolf stuff and all of this stuff why because he wrote books and he says so like he believes it and that do you agree that preconceived beliefs could cloud your scientific ambitions absolutely and it&#x27;s clear in many ways that this was a believer program set up by a believer faction i i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s disputed or if it is it shouldn&#x27;t be if you look you will find particularly if you look with a believer mindset dr hartman at the university of nevada was not the only one not impressed by bass in 2009 the pentagon determined the awsap reports submitted by bass were of limited value the pentagon pulled the program&#x27;s funding and by 2012 the program was officially dead at this point robert bigelow decided he was done with skinwalker ranch on literally april fool&#x27;s day in 2016 bigelow sold the ranch to another real estate millionaire searching for the paranormal brandon fugle [Music] and while bigelow was very secretive about the ranch and never allowed the public to see behind its gates fugle has brought in the history channel to produce a reality tv show called the secret of skinwalker ranch this is the most unique science project of its kind some of the most disturbing unexplained events have occurred on this property that sounds exciting and maybe even a little bit scary right right fugle claims he was once a skeptic of skinwalker and didn&#x27;t necessarily believe the spooky stories from the bigelow days but he says all this changed when he himself had a paranormal experience at the ranch he now believes something is there something real something bizarre and extraordinary the reality of the anomalies that are occurring on the property really all combine to tell us that what we are dealing with at skinwalker ranch is absolute reality he is so confident that something otherworldly is occurring at the ranch that he has opened the gates to a very vocal skeptic and said come to the ranch and see for yourself i&#x27;m setting up camp in front of homestead 2 which according to the scientists and people who work here is one of the most haunted places on the ranch i just heard a thump oh i can see it what is that i&#x27;m spending the entire night by myself at skinwalker ranch [Music] [Music] you</p>
