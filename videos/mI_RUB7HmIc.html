            <p>Oh, that is perfect. Right where it needs to be. &gt;&gt; We took scientifically accurate measurements and they lead us to a spot somewhere up here over the ranch. That is our next measurement. And the way we could do that is we tether a weather balloon and raise it up through that region that has equipment on it.</p>
<p>That couldn&#x27;t have worked out better. I don&#x27;t think &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s a good launch. I say we pack up and go back and try and track it on the internet. If this experiment is successful, it&#x27;ll tell us exactly where these energy spikes are occurring and hopefully what&#x27;s causing them. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s It&#x27;s not This is not updating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s strange to me. That&#x27;s supposed to update every minute. &gt;&gt; Crazy that the point where we lost contact with the balloon is at the exact same altitude we calculated the RF energy to be coming from. &gt;&gt; So, the interpretation of this is there&#x27;s something above us sending signals down.</p>
