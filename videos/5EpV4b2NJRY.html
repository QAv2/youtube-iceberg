<p>How the hell are you, my friend? Oh, I&#x27;m doing well. It&#x27;s going to be a very interesting Friday night show tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. &gt;&gt; We have a lot to talk about. &gt;&gt; Oh, you&#x27;re telling me about 300 plus screenshot.</p>
<p>Screenshot. Screenshot. Screenshot of the agent disclosure. We&#x27;ll look at it as like a slideshow. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Going through it. And it should be because we&#x27;re just showing &gt;&gt; slides. We should be okay, right? I would think so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We&#x27;re We&#x27;ll even show part of the screen that I&#x27;ll take the screenshots out of OBS.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s amazing what you can go ahead and capture when you&#x27;re capturing from from another device. Yeah, I&#x27;ve got I&#x27;ve got the pipeline that lets you get anything. On that note, Mike, uh yeah, great great day today. Uh did you enjoy uh the movie? &gt;&gt; Yeah, very interesting. You and I were talking when we were listening to the movie and there wasn&#x27;t anything that we haven&#x27;t covered on the show for the past couple of years now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Nothing new, nothing that we haven&#x27;t already said and put out there. If you remember, um, every point that was made in this documentary has been bits and pieces that we had been covering the whole time, &gt;&gt; right? All we got with this is confirmation. &gt;&gt; Well, it was it gives us continuity. It gives a long version of Lou&#x27;s story of what went on for a lot of different things.</p>
<p>And it takes us from disclosure, what happened starting before 2017 all the way up to what&#x27;s happening on today. So, it&#x27;s they call it the age of disclosure. I think that it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going to happen. They&#x27;ve been talking about the disclosure that has been happening &gt;&gt; and it&#x27;s still going on. Disclosure for the public hasn&#x27;t happened as they say in the movie is because they can&#x27;t tell the people about that.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t handle the truth. &gt;&gt; And the average person doesn&#x27;t have any idea exactly about the information that they covered in this documentary all in one place that you and I have been covering in many different places for years now. So this is a condensed version. If people are interested in this topic from the public and don&#x27;t have the information that we&#x27;ve gathered over a long period of time from many different people, they could sit down and watch this and get like a refresher course. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, and for the people on X who are, if you want to call it, the Lou Alzando hate hate club, they&#x27;ve got they&#x27;ve got to be freaking going crazy because all this does is just give more credibility to what Lou has done, what Lou has been saying, you know, going ahead all the things they&#x27;ve been going ahead and trying to ruin his credibility on. It just seems like they&#x27;re they&#x27;re the true disinformation agents out there. You just got to wonder, you know? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ll leave it at that. They are. You&#x27;re absolutely right about that.</p>
<p>And all the um strikes that have been piling up for them shows you that they&#x27;re not honest and it&#x27;s all disinformation they&#x27;ve been doing out there. &gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly. My friend, if we can uh Corporal A have your hand up, my friend. &gt;&gt; Hey guys.</p>
<p>Uh happy almost Thanksgiving. Uh I haven&#x27;t really seen the the movie yet, but I plan on watching it maybe tonight. But is this if it&#x27;s not disclosure, is this like an acclamation process or an education process, an early on boarding for everybody that&#x27;s not military, government, or in the UFO community globally, maybe even potentially, &gt;&gt; you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a movie for anyone who has interest in this, but may have been on the sidelines, not tracking stuff from day to day, but have heard things along the way. Um, it&#x27;s a good way to get up to speed on all the things that have been happening. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s how I see it as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s a good point. &gt;&gt; This is difficult to catch up that have been behind. &gt;&gt; Is this a is this a part of a government processed planned scheduled information release disclosure? Well, a Thomas and I talked about this on previous shows recently and we made it clear that the way it actually works, all the information that we have covered and has been out there for years now, it came directly from the government. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In one form or another.</p>
<p>There really is no such thing as a whistleblower because all of the information that these people who have come forward have put out there publicly was all authorized by the US government. &gt;&gt; They weren&#x27;t giving us information. So, let me finish. They weren&#x27;t giving us information that they weren&#x27;t allowed to tell the public. &gt;&gt; They were giving information that the government wanted the public to know.</p>
<p>So they&#x27;re more like spokesmen to the government, not whistleblowers. And Thomas and I have been covering that aspect of this recently because it&#x27;s the truth. Everything we&#x27;ve ever gotten in this topic has all been controlled and released bit by bit, drip by drip from the government, &gt;&gt; from the DoD, specifically the Doppser process, which takes any statements that they&#x27;re going to make and they basically censor anything out of that that they don&#x27;t want them to talk about. So, it&#x27;s giving them a script that&#x27;s their stuff, but there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that&#x27;s, you know, it&#x27;s like uh the government&#x27;s the editor. Anything they want to take out of there, because remember, it comes down to the point that Alp put off and others made in this in this flick that, you know, we have to be careful not even to inspire our enemies, which would be China, Russia, anyone else in the world, because they have craft, we have craft, and we don&#x27;t want to give them any inspiration from stuff we may know or figured out.</p>
<p>that may help them to figure it out before we do because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bigger race than it was to create the atom bomb. &gt;&gt; Last question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Expect more from can we expect disclosure from the executive branch or more of this process? &gt;&gt; Well, Rush was alluding to that in his interview tonight that we may be getting that at one point from this administration. &gt;&gt; All right.</p>
<p>Heads or tails? &gt;&gt; Seriously. Heads or tails? Abe? &gt;&gt; Heads. Tails. Tails, tails, &gt;&gt; Eagles, go birds. &gt;&gt; Tails, it is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Birds, we&#x27;re going to win against the Cowboys. &gt;&gt; There you go. We&#x27;ll see. And you know, for reference, it&#x27;s a cheap modern penny. Very thin.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve stopped making these things lately. But yeah, it&#x27;s got a shield on the back. I&#x27;ll take that. But yeah, it&#x27;s a penny. There you go.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s about as close as we&#x27;re going to be able to get to it. All right, let&#x27;s go ahead and uh so to start this off, we actually Jean, you have your hand up next, my friend. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just going to add that I think the you know, I think it did a really nice job framing the complexities of the issue overall. You know, I don&#x27;t think it it it didn&#x27;t go into any territory that um you know, is sort of speculative or whatever.</p>
<p>Everybody was very straightforward about what their experience and and information was that they had. They broke down the national security aspect of it. They broke down the societal aspects of it. The issues that go along with that, you know, yes, the parts about the um you know, adversaries having it first, you know, versus us. Again, I think they know a lot more about that than anybody let on in there.</p>
<p>Overall, you know, it kind of stayed in the guard rails. It laid it all out nicely. Yeah. Nothing extraord, you know, threw in a few stories, which was good. Um, and in background and u, you know, as you said, it was, you know, both a a good primer and a good reminder.</p>
<p>I think it, you know, my takeaway of the message was, you know, as a society, it&#x27;s right now larger than the community. It&#x27;s about getting our arms around the parts of it that we can get our arms around and be definitive about um and move forward that way. So, I thought it was a good uh good documentary and good message overall. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Exactly.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s great to see Lou in this talking about all the different stuff again. Uh this is before Lou went through his weight transformation. Good to see him now. Probably what lost 50 lbs at least. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. Absolutely. It shows what can go on when you put your mind to it. On that note, I uh speak getting back to go ahead and talk about if you want to call it whistleblowers. We&#x27;ve got a video a interview here.</p>
<p>Uh David Grush uh who&#x27;s been MIA for the longest time and we&#x27;ve been waiting for Dave to come around. Abe, do you still have your hand up or you? Okay. All right. Good. All right.</p>
<p>Thanks, Admit. Let Ed in. All right. So, let&#x27;s go ahead and get this interview up of uh uh David Grush on Fox News on the Bret Bear Show. We heard about this back I think September 9th or so.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been a while and it&#x27;s great to see it. It finally came out. So, on that note, let me find the right set I need to get to. There we go. Let&#x27;s bring it up and let&#x27;s play this.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s play this episode. Let&#x27;s play this clip. Here we go. Welcome back to Special Report. Tonight we continue our series looking at unidentified anomalous anonymous say that easy phenomena.</p>
<p>What uh many people still call UFOs, UAPs. Last week we spoke with the director of The Age of Disclosure. It&#x27;s a new documentary out about a suspected government cover up over UAPs for decades, which debuts tonight in select theaters around the country. is also available on Prime Video. It&#x27;s powerful.</p>
<p>It features testimony from 34 former and current government officials, including witnesses who have testified before Congress. Earlier, we spoke with another whistleblower who is now a congressional task force member on the UAP subject. &gt;&gt; If you believe we have crashed craft, uh stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? &gt;&gt; Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah. Um, were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics? &gt;&gt; Non-human.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, let&#x27;s get some insight into the UAP or UFO, it used to be called, controversy, and what Congress is trying to do about it. Joining us now, retired Air Force Major David Grush, who has been a whistleblower on the subject of UFOs, UAPs, and government transparency. He&#x27;s a special adviser now to the House UAP Task Force. Thanks for being here. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me on, Brett.</p>
<p>So since then people say where is the evidence? What&#x27;s happening? Why don&#x27;t we know more right now almost two years later? &gt;&gt; Well certainly the last administration didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t help and my my hearing of course was during the last administration and they were not exactly super transparent on this issue unfortunately. Uh but now that the task force has been created um I&#x27;ve been able to you know guide the members within the boundaries of uh what they&#x27;re actually cleared for. When people look at this, they look online, they say, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot out there. There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about encounters. There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about videos, and we&#x27;ve seen a lot of that.&quot; &gt;&gt; Can we just cut it down to you believe that we have encountered alien beings and that they&#x27;ve come to Earth and that we know about it as a US government? &gt;&gt; That seems to be the case.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like to characterize necessarily where they came from. They&#x27;re definitely some kind of nonhuman sentience, but it is true. Believe it or not, we&#x27;ve recovered the vehicles um and we actually have physical proof and I was actually uh partially cleared into some of those activities. It was beyond uh oral testimony provided to me. I actually had partial access uh to the data and actually read the intelligence reports uh resulting from those programs &gt;&gt; with your own eyes.</p>
<p>You saw it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so when people say this is kooky, this is out there. There&#x27;s nothing to back it up. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t speak for other parts of the government, but I can tell you NASA, which I speak for, is open and transparent with our data. &gt;&gt; Do you believe what Mr.</p>
<p>David Crush said or is he lying? &gt;&gt; Whatever he said, where&#x27;s the evidence? &gt;&gt; Oh god, the freaking Amway salesman again. Thank God he&#x27;s gone. &gt;&gt; What do you say? Certainly members of this current administration are very very well aware of this reality. Um uh certainly the the current president um is very knowledgeable on this subject and I trust his leadership on it and I think he&#x27;s assembled an an a team cabinet and I really believe uh if Trump wants to be the greatest president and the most consequential leader likely in world history, he certainly um has the knowledge, the capabilities and understanding of some of these sensitive government transparency issues. I have access but and I I speak to people about it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had actually meetings on it. People that are very smart and very solid have said they believe there is something out there and you know makes sense that there could be. I&#x27;ve never been convinced even despite that you know I just for some reason it&#x27;s not my thing. So you think one he knows and two he&#x27;s open to transparency on UAPs? &gt;&gt; Uh he certainly is very well informed on this issue. Uh leave it at that.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to get ahead of what the president might want to reveal personally. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s been a role to cover this up, &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re saying, uh, through administrations. &gt;&gt; Um, and there have been people who have been threatened and told not to testify. &gt;&gt; I was, uh, physically threatened even before I sent in my intelligence community inspector general report under the previous administration. I actually had to go and and seek legal protection that way because I was, you know, literally in fear both professionally and in my personal life.</p>
<p>And when you mentioned in that testimony of recovering the pilots or or remains nonhuman, &gt;&gt; that&#x27;s something that you saw as far as the intelligence with your eyes. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it is a very uncomfortable even for me now as as somebody who&#x27;s seen it, experienced it, even talking about it because it&#x27;s so um outside a normal person&#x27;s worldview to understand that there is um this biological sentience that have piloted these crafts that don&#x27;t necessarily look 100% like you and I. &gt;&gt; Were there pictures? Were there &gt;&gt; there were Yes, there were. &gt;&gt; When I said from another planet or from outer space, you said not we don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;re from.</p>
<p>Is it interdimensional? What what are we talking about? &gt;&gt; Uh I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of call gray beards on the program. That is a subject of hot debate on origin. I&#x27;ve as a guy trained in physics formally as well. In my background, I leave an open mind on what the origin is. Uh certainly uh there is the extraterrestrial hypothesis and they could be coming from elsewhere off Earth, but I don&#x27;t usually go there cuz I did not see that data.</p>
<p>I and I&#x27;m not conversant in the high confidence theories that the US government had. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not aware of any remains that the department has um uh of you know any signs of extraterrestrial beings or activity or technology. &gt;&gt; You say we the US government knows but there are many other governments around the world. &gt;&gt; Do they know? They have their own programs and like I said two and a half years ago uh we have been an arms race with our peer competitors you know namely Russia and China and they have their own programs in that in this regard and I was actually able to view a body of intelligence that discussed um adversarial programs and I&#x27;ll leave it at that. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve recovered things you say yeah &gt;&gt; bodies and physical remains.</p>
<p>Was there a sense that the motive of whether how they got here, what they were doing, was it peaceful, not peaceful? We&#x27;ve seen a mixed bag of activity. Um, and uh motive and intent, why they&#x27;re visiting. That&#x27;s once again that gets into our assessments, not necessarily we can&#x27;t quite understand the intent of some of the sentients and why they&#x27;re visiting. Could it be because uh we have interesting genetic material on Earth? uh we&#x27;re uh Jurassic Park tourist attraction for them could be a myriad of reasons &gt;&gt; for the other people who are coming out &gt;&gt; you say to them what you&#x27;ve obviously faced intimidation you talked about harassment u there are reports that others have too &gt;&gt; I say that uh there&#x27;s hope um certainly uh Congress values whistleblower information right now and certainly I believe there&#x27;s an appetite with the administration to do the right thing on this as Well, um, and there&#x27;s some other things that are happening behind the scenes that I&#x27;ll let the administration discuss when they&#x27;re ready. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>Well, we appreciate your time and, uh, we&#x27;ll follow every element. It&#x27;s fascinating. &gt;&gt; Y, thanks for having me on &gt;&gt; there. There we go. Great interview on on that.</p>
<p>Uh, Corporal Abe, it looks like you have your hand up, my friend. Let me bring you in here and we can go ahead and talk about it while we&#x27;ve got this looping in the background. Go ahead, Abe. Maybe not. &gt;&gt; I think my hand&#x27;s just been up the entire time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, I can I can put it down for you. Hold on a second. Here we go. Done. &gt;&gt; Back up again.</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s down. Hey, Mike. What&#x27;s your thoughts? Interesting conversation coming from Grush. Uh, right at the same time that we&#x27;ve got the Age of Disclosure coming out. Great timing from that effect.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s good to see him again talking about something that a lot of people look look to him for. And more importantly, it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s a sad point that Congress has been so unable to move things forward since he gave his ground baking testimony. What was it two and a half years ago? &gt;&gt; Two and a half years ago. &gt;&gt; Has it been that long? God. Yeah.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve all aged since then. &gt;&gt; We we have time has gone by too quickly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what I thought was interesting is the fact that now we have more pieces of the puzzle coming directly from David Grush. He said that he&#x27;s seen photographs of the actual NHI.</p>
<p>And what he didn&#x27;t say in this interview, and by the way, he didn&#x27;t do this interview tonight. It was pre-recorded. &gt;&gt; September 9th is when he did this, &gt;&gt; correct? So, people will think it coincides with the release of the Age of Disclosure. It really doesn&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>But that being said, he&#x27;s seen photographs and if you remember when he was at that VIP meeting in Wall Street right after he did the testimony in Congress, he also said that was what was going to be in his oped was the information he shared at that private meeting that one night that he went in and came out like and two hours later and went back home. He said that the NHI biologics are for the first time publicly admitted by a government official. He said they are in fact the type that have been reported by abductees for decades. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The gray type.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So now we know where he got that information from because at that meeting he didn&#x27;t say he saw photographs. Now we know where he saw and knows what type of biologics, &gt;&gt; right? But also what government is in possession of. &gt;&gt; Also what he said lines up with what Dr. Eric Davis said. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; To a degree. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To a degree. But it&#x27;s interesting because um he said that there were also craft that when the people that were by the craft went in it was 40 ft in diameter on the outside and it was over 300 ft on the inside.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Now he said that at the meeting he was supposed to relay all this information when he released the op-ed that we still haven&#x27;t seen yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But this was the information that was going to be in that oped &gt;&gt; when and if it ever comes out. But you and I have been reporting on this over two years now about what was in there, what he knows about. &gt;&gt; 40 ft on the outside, size of a football field on the inside, different time.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re in there for a couple minutes and they come out and four hours has passed. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s been out there in the general conversation for a time. But it&#x27;s also nice to see all this information kind of pulled together. Now, if I can, Mike, I&#x27;ve got way too many screenshots to go through. So, if people don&#x27;t want a spoiler for what was covered in the film, &gt;&gt; tune out now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Tune out now. I hate to say it, but let&#x27;s go ahead and cover this. And we&#x27;re still trying to figure out a way we can get some people to watch this. Mike, I know I&#x27;ve heard there&#x27;s a 1080p version floating around out there and everyone&#x27;s downloading it. So, might there might be links on X and other places.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll see what you can do to kind of throw you that way potentially, but I plump down to $24.99. What the hell? Why not? Let&#x27;s go ahead and support the filmmaker on this one. And yes, you&#x27;re going to see all the screenshots I took from OBS as I was watching this on my Apple TV and capturing it on my Mac. And it&#x27;s something I could actually record the whole video. But no, let&#x27;s just go ahead and start with uh what we&#x27;ve got going here.</p>
<p>Yes. Would you look at that? We&#x27;ve got uh oh, what is that? Uh 308 viewers in in the show right now. And how many likes do we have? Let&#x27;s go ahead and take a look. 80 likes. If you&#x27;re enjoying this program and want to give me uh props for going ahead and spending this time to get it together, we&#x27;d love to have you a like.</p>
<p>And if you&#x27;re new to the show, I&#x27; we appreciate a subscription. Uh we we try to do our best here, don&#x27;t we, Mike? &gt;&gt; Well, we do. We bend over backwards. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; And put in more time than the public actually sees from when they&#x27;re on watching the show.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; The cost of a subscription is free. And we&#x27;ll even give you a double your money back guarantee on that. Now, granted, this movie costs $24.99 plus tax and everything else. You got to remember, Mike, we&#x27;re in a society now where the cost of a Jersey Mike submarine has gone up from 9 bucks to 20 bucks, and it looks like you&#x27;re getting about half to me thanks to the investment community.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a little bit high, but the thing is it&#x27;s the price of buying the new books a lot of times like eminent and such. So, you know, right, &gt;&gt; let&#x27;s get to this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is going to be fun to cover. &gt;&gt; So, let&#x27;s go ahead and get to this. So, everyone interviewed in this film has direct knowledge of unidentified aerial aerial anomalous phenomena as a result of their work in the US government.</p>
<p>While some of their knowledge is classified, they are now breaking silence better than breaking wind with what they can lawfully disclose. There you go. What they can lawfully disclose means what we&#x27;re listening to is everything has been censored by the federal government. Let&#x27;s continue. All right.</p>
<p>You know, we&#x27;ve got a bunch of statements coming in from Ryan Graves, from uh help me with the names here, Mike. Um, from the tic tac. Uh, yeah, Fraver. We&#x27;ve got &gt;&gt; Commander David Fraver. &gt;&gt; We got Christopher Melon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Bunch of people all coming out. Melon. Uh, we got uh here we go. Hell off. And we&#x27;ve got uh our friend of uh oh god my my mind is off right now.</p>
<p>Well, it&#x27;s Carl Nell. Can&#x27;t forget Carl Nell, Dr. Eric Davis, Dr. Gary Nolan&#x27;s there. And uh let&#x27;s get into uh oh yeah, not that one.</p>
<p>All right. So Gary Nolan, Christopher Melon, all contained in the age of disclosure. What you&#x27;re getting is you&#x27;re getting a lot of clips of guys talking about stuff all contiguous about what was going on, taking as they&#x27;re getting into different parts of the subjects, taking parts of their interviews, all putting it together and giving you one convenient place to go ahead and look at this stuff. So, uh, you got Lu Alazando walking around the nation. Of course, he was a former, uh, Department of Defense official, uh, that he was part of the UAP task force back in the day.</p>
<p>uh they go through Lou&#x27;s uh military history of course and then um you know saying about what he dealt with that he was even working for if you want to call it the White House at a period of time. Uh here he is with uh James Clapper uh who he briefed in on this and of course then we got Jay Stratton. Jay was brought in I believe he was part of uh ATIP and he was also like the head of the UAP task force right Mike? &gt;&gt; Yes he was correct. Yeah, Jay Stratton also has a book coming out soon. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that should be pretty Oh, it should be very interesting.</p>
<p>Mike, let&#x27;s go. He goes through his his history of what he went through to try and give you an idea of who this guy is, what he went through, and you know, help qualify some of the statements that he gets pretty deep into making. So, uh, again, back at the Pentagon, they&#x27;re talking about, you know, that it&#x27;s covered up at all places in the FBI. It&#x27;s covered up in the CIA, and it&#x27;s all been incorporated when they had the ATIP, which is the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, which was initially called OAP. Um, sounds like that was started somewhere around 2007 or so based on this.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go. And that was all funded by, of course, Harry Reid. So, this is like a walkthrough of all of the history of what took place starting back in before 2017, if not all the way back to 2007. I think that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re calling it the age of disclosure. It&#x27;s not, again, I said this earlier, it&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re going to expect.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve had so far as far as disclosure. And it&#x27;s a process. Mike, I think there&#x27;s one thing we can get everyone to agree on here. Full disclosure for the American people hasn&#x27;t happened. We&#x27;ve had a soft disclosure coming from the federal government.</p>
<p>Remember when we had the UAPTF at a period of time the federal government was giving out all the information for everybody and then after the UAPF was shut down and we got ARO, they closed the book and they started denying everything. And we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s extraterrestrials. We don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re coming from another dimension, if they&#x27;re ancient uh another life form that was on this planet a long time ago. It&#x27;s something, you know, we&#x27;ll figure out every time cuz don&#x27;t forget, folks, we have major uh cataclysms on this planet that happen regularly every 12,000 years. And actually on every 3,000 years cycle, there&#x27;s major bumps that happen.</p>
<p>And we are at the 12,000 mark on top of a 3,000 mark. So, we&#x27;re just waiting for the next wave literally to come our way. So, let&#x27;s move on. All right. Talking about uh if you want to call a Harry Reid when he was working with Obama and then we, you know, we got Lou back in here and talking about, you know, for nearly a dec decade, he investigated UAP incidents around the world that were based on hard evidence and and data that we learned that UAPs are present and a serious national security concerns.</p>
<p>Now, if you go and watch this movie and you&#x27;re with your friends, have a drinking game, every single time you hear the mention national security, do a shop, it&#x27;s pervasive. It&#x27;s almost Mike about they should call this the age of the national security coverup because that&#x27;s really what it turns into. Let&#x27;s move on. You know, calling it a potential existential threat that we&#x27;re dealing with. You know, they talk about them being transmedium vehicles that have the capability to operate in the space in the air.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s interesting about this, Mike, is they bring out the info, they bring out the video and show it a bunch of times from the Aquado of Puerto Rico incident was probably one of the best ones we&#x27;ve ever had where we had a DHS helicopter out there um recording on multiple sensors a uh UAP or let&#x27;s call it a UFO flying around the airport and such in the base after coming out of the ocean, circling around it for a while, going back into the ocean, going transmedium underneath the water, and then accelerating once they were underneath the water. Really amazing stuff and it&#x27;s probably one of the best sightings we&#x27;ve ever gotten recordings of. Let&#x27;s continue. All right. And water, of course, that defy all human humanity knows about physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we only know so much about physics. We think we know everything, but we know a little bit. Let&#x27;s be happy about that. Let&#x27;s move on. They&#x27;ve been operating with with complete impunity around the world since the 1940s.</p>
<p>And remember, we&#x27;ve never had domain over our skies ever. And this is one of the reasons why the government doesn&#x27;t want to tell us anything because they don&#x27;t want us to know that we&#x27;ve never had domain over our skies, meaning control over the skies. We&#x27;ve never had that domain over our waters, domain over our land. Because the non-human intelligence, as Lou put it, Mike, we&#x27;ll give him a spoiler, has come out and once again said and clarified, it&#x27;s not a zoo. it.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t call it a zoo or farm, but he said we are not the top of the food chain. We are not the apex predator on this planet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Which kind of means we&#x27;re on the menu. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. It means we&#x27;re not running the farm. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Might be living on it. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s move on. At he had access to some of the most sensitive videos in the Department of Defense inventory. If you could be in his shoes and saw what he saw and seen what he&#x27;s seen like in folks like Jay Stratton who has there would be zero shadow of a doubt that these things are real. Let&#x27;s move along. And they&#x27;re not made by humans most importantly because of technology they just they demonstrate it&#x27;s beyond our anyone on this planet&#x27;s capability.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still well human for that matter. Let&#x27;s move on. Uh the Jay Stratton goes on to talk about the things that he&#x27;s seen. The the clearest videos unlike the videos we get, Mike, they&#x27;re all crap. They&#x27;re all fuzzed out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re all downresed. &gt;&gt; Downresed on purpose. That&#x27;s right. But the best evidence that we have that these non-human they&#x27;re not showing it to us and they and these are non-human intelligence all remain classified. Meaning, Mike, they don&#x27;t want to show shit to us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s nice to have brush telling us about it, but they won&#x27;t show it to us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. Now, we got uh hell put off and Eric Davis talking about that about the classified data that we had access to when we joined the program was indisputable. So, these old guys have seen it.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re getting really old. This is the kind of thing that&#x27;s been talked about recently. They need to come out and start talking about this before they get too old, Mike, and they they lose the opportunity to give us the truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Jim Latsky was talking about that recently with the interview he did with George Knap and Jeremy Corbel. &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And also like all of the OAP files that um J Stratton was working on and Jim Lassky at Osap, they don&#x27;t know where they are. The government seems to have lost track. or they misplaced them or they deleted them like Jim Lowsky said. Could be. So that information will be lost indefinitely if they don&#x27;t take steps to really preserve what we&#x27;ve uh discovered.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Really quick, &gt;&gt; really quick. The guy who&#x27;s down in Maria Marina Del Rey, California, &gt;&gt; who has all these videos, he calls them dragons. They&#x27;re insects. Just saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there&#x27;s that too, Thomas. All right explanation. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Let&#x27;s get on to this. Here we go.</p>
<p>When we joined the program was indisputable. There&#x27;s 80 years of this data that the public isn&#x27;t even aware of. Uh, I&#x27;ve seen them with my own eyes. Non-human craft and non-human beings. So, this actually sounds like Mike, he isn&#x27;t talking about seeing pictures, is he? He&#x27;s talking about seeing with his own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings, &gt;&gt; right? which means he&#x27;s se he&#x27;s seen some of the oh god yes Dr.</p>
<p>Robert Shep. I know who he is. I&#x27;ve seen his videos. I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve gone through them with him on the call. And they are insects 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>If you see something moving around fast and it&#x27;s got wings flapping, it&#x27;s an insect. Let&#x27;s move on. &gt;&gt; Well, you know what they say. If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck, it&#x27;s a duck. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a duck.</p>
<p>Absolutely. But if people want to believe in that, go ahead. I&#x27;m just trying to help guide you to uh dealing with the hundreds of hours of footage I&#x27;ve looked at. So, let&#x27;s go ahead and move on. We see them with my own eyes as non-human craft and non-human beings.</p>
<p>And then we get the Colonel James Cobb who was for who was part of NORAD. Um he was he was a pilot on the A-10 Warthog and while he was at NORAD, he witnessed event he&#x27;ll remember forever. There was an unknown object they were tracking on radars and the commander says, &quot;I want that target.&quot; Now, Mike, this is the incident when they had a UFO that appeared on the East Coast. I think it was around Ohio or something potentially and it shot across towards the ocean and it went and uh basically went AC along the entire east coast, got down in Florida and shot out of there. And no matter what we could potentially do, not any of our craft could stop this craft or could intercept this craft.</p>
<p>And he&#x27;s one of the ones who said we&#x27;re unable to tain air sovereignty over North America. I again it begs I ask the question when is the when has America or any country in the world actually had air sovereignty over their country and I would say never &gt;&gt; and you would be right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We want to think we&#x27;re safe. We want to think everything&#x27;s okay but it&#x27;s the bubble we live in.</p>
<p>Uh let&#x27;s go ahead and move along and uh we get into commander David Fraver who was part of the Nimtts talks about he was the most personent uh senior person in the squadron flying. Yes, we&#x27;ve heard about the incident a bunch of times or chasing UAP the tic tacs. The thing was doing 32,000 m an hour and obviously it&#x27;s not technology the United States. And then we have another person who&#x27;s part of that flight crew, Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrix, who said this was defying the laws of physics, laws of gravity that as pilots we live and uh die by. Now um they&#x27;ve talked about then literally we had these things stalking naval vessels.</p>
<p>Uh the frequency in which UAP were being reported to us was increasing. But it&#x27;s not just increasing to us, it&#x27;s increasing Oh, the Epstein files are out, folks. Don&#x27;t worry about that. Can&#x27;t wait to see whose names are in there honestly. Uh here I hear Hakee Jeff name is in there.</p>
<p>How about that? Uh the frequency in which UAP were being reported to us is increasing. But it&#x27;s not just us. It&#x27;s pe it&#x27;s all countries around the world. You know uh they&#x27;re calling it a safety issue. Ryan Graves and he simply described it.</p>
<p>you know, they saw they had uh two uh two jets flying about 150 feet apart going fullb boore and they had a UAP come and split right between them. Now they&#x27;re thinking, &quot;Oh my god, this thing is almost going to hit us. What what the hell are we going to do?&quot; No, it comes down to it of the way these craft are moving. We&#x27;re like in slow motion. So, we&#x27;re just barely going around about 500 mph in our jet fighters.</p>
<p>And then you get the UAP to come and just kind of go right between us. We&#x27;re freaking out because we&#x27;re having to control all this stuff going so fast. But when you get the UAP to come right between it, Mike, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s pretty much zero risk of that UAP actually in colliding with those jet fighters unless they purposely wanted to. What do you think? &gt;&gt; Well, I think that it&#x27;s the difference between, as another as an analogy, an F-35 or an F-22 fifth generation aircraft maneuvering between air balloons. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re not going to hit him. &gt;&gt; Nope. Right. Oh, it&#x27;s like uh a rabbit uh navigating between two turtles. How about that? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. There we go. Work. &gt;&gt; So, non-human intelligence has been actively conducting ISR, which is intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance on our nuclear sites and on our uh nuclear weapons, our nuclear energy and everything. Got to wonder why they&#x27;re not liking what we&#x27;re seeing, what we&#x27;re doing with it.</p>
<p>But let&#x27;s move on. and some of most sensitive US military facilities and nuclear sites. They&#x27;ve both activated and deactivated nuclear weapons. We&#x27;ve heard the story about Robert Salis, how they shut down uh 10 missiles that were in Maelstrom Air Force Base. And we&#x27;ve also heard the same story about the same time of the you of the nuclear weapons that were in Ukraine that the non-human intelligence showed up and actually started the countdown sequence for launching the missiles that the Russians freaked out because they could not shut it down.</p>
<p>Phenomenal stories, my friend. So, let&#x27;s move on. All right. By the way, this just isn&#x27;t happening in the US. Like we said, it&#x27;s happening around the world with greater frequency.</p>
<p>Um, Christopher Melon pops in, talks about how, you know, it made him aware of not only the phenomenon was real, but it was ongoing and a persistent phenomenon. And nobody was doing anything about this in the federal government, at least outside of the the program other than Lou. And Lou was determined to immediately do actually and Christopher was determined immediately to do whatever he could do to help get Lou to the Secretary of Defense to move that information forward. And now I think he tried to get the Secretary of Defense, but wasn&#x27;t he shut down, Mike? It was. There were members within the Pentagon that felt that this phenomenon was based on demons and um &gt;&gt; Oh, we&#x27;ve got that coming soon.</p>
<p>Yeah. and they didn&#x27;t want to have the secretary of defense was mad dog James Mattis at the time. They didn&#x27;t want him to be uh bothered with this information. They felt it should just go by the wayside because of strong religious convictions. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That group was called the Collins Elite. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And they still operate in &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. Unfortunately, they do, Mike. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Get back this when I was any. Okay, let&#x27;s move on then. Uh, all right.</p>
<p>So, we were met with the fiercest resistance. The stigma alone and that taboo of the topic. Of course, the historical association of UFOs was something that most people in leadership positions was too big of a a pill to swallow. Now, Mike, apparently this whole stigma around UFOs and reporting it is only is only in the United States. No, Thomas, it&#x27;s not.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s all around the world. It&#x27;s China. It&#x27;s Russia. &gt;&gt; No, the stigma with with regards to people reporting it to their governments, what they said in the movie was the stigma about reporting this stuff within their organizations is more within the United States. Yeah, not the best picture of Lou, but I was just not looking for the wrong frames, but uh yeah, let&#x27;s move on here.</p>
<p>Um All right. Um, now we&#x27;re back to Hell Put Off and Eric Davis interviewed together. They couldn&#x27;t get leadership in the Pentagon to look at the actual scientific data. This is where we&#x27;re getting into them going ahead. Oh, thank you, Gene.</p>
<p>We got a COMO interview of Luisando. We&#x27;ll inter uh thank you. Interrupt this in a second. Religion is the biggest problem. Mike, not that one.</p>
<p>That showed that there is a strong national security threat. uh they were uh were really religious fundamentalists, extremists in the Pentagon that had a severe adversity to this topic who were putting religion above national security. A senior DoD official actually stopped me in the halls of Pentagon Jr. talking and told me that we are doing the devil&#x27;s work in their world that these are demons and we are poking demons and messing in Satan&#x27;s world and all those other things. &gt;&gt; Nice.</p>
<p>Lovely. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you know that goes back to something cargo cult potentially. If you go back and look at potentially how some of these sightings of demons and other things that have gone in the past could have been a non-human intelligence and religious fanatics at that time tied it to the particular phenomenas. It could be the same thing, but it&#x27;s just ancient interpretations versus v version versus present interpretations.</p>
<p>But these ancient uh interpretations were religious. So it perpetuates in the text and the teachings of those people. &gt;&gt; So take a look at the typical gray type of alien. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; If you had no idea what that was and weren&#x27;t as knowledgeable as we are today with the internet, our phones, and the research that&#x27;s been done.</p>
<p>And you had no other context. You would assume you&#x27;re looking at a demon. &gt;&gt; Oh god. Who was that guy in Los Angeles years ago went and did the uh seances and stuff and tried to connect it and he actually had a picture of something that he drew that kind of looked like a gray. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>I know who you&#x27;re talking about. &gt;&gt; Anyone in the back remember? I don&#x27;t. But yeah, let&#x27;s Does a chat get it? No. Let&#x27;s go ahead and move on. Not Not Elon Hubard.</p>
<p>This is back in the 40s or 50s, I think. Let&#x27;s move on. I&#x27;m briefing about an advanced aerospace vehicle that has been detected. You&#x27;re telling me that these are demons and we shouldn&#x27;t let it look at them. Yeah, Alistister Crowley.</p>
<p>You got it. Big bad. Real bad daddy. Thank you very much. That&#x27;s exactly.</p>
<p>He had pictures that he drew of meditations of what he saw that kind of looks like a gray. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; So, we shouldn&#x27;t look and uh we shouldn&#x27;t look at them and study them. Come on. You can do this.</p>
<p>Uh, we discovered another deeply h uh hidden and much larger UAP program. This program was so sensitive that it withheld from Congress, the Secretary of Defense and Congress and even the President of the United States is the problem. The pro uh the program is referred to the legacy program. And wasn&#x27;t that the name of the last movie that came out from uh James Fox? The program? &gt;&gt; Yes, it was called The Program. You&#x27;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, &gt;&gt; interesting. &gt;&gt; Seems pretty accurate. Let&#x27;s move on. You know, they were retrieving, you know, apparently the United States has been retrieving and reversing engineering UAPs since at least 1947.</p>
<p>These retrievalss included bodies of nonhumans, some sort of intelligence, intelligent beings. &gt;&gt; Talked about the magenta 1933 Italy recovery. And on the Joe Rogan interview, David Grush also said that there were instances before that that he can&#x27;t talk about. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Someone says, &quot;Really, Shinobi Kenobi? You can&#x27;t possibly state certain that it isn&#x27;t demonic.&quot; No, we&#x27;re not saying it&#x27;s not demonic.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re saying the exact same thing that they saw in the past that they consider was demonic, right? by what was going on that was beyond our ca humans capabilities at that time. They saw it as demons. What I then went on and said, and this could be the exact same stuff we&#x27;re seeing today, but that information because of, you know, we&#x27;re seeing it now. We&#x27;re calling it something else. Someone saw it hundreds of years ago and they&#x27;ve got a different name for it.</p>
<p>That name is perpetuated through religion and other texts and people think it&#x27;s demons when it could be the same thing. We don&#x27;t know what it is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, please don&#x27;t I mean, if you want to jump to the conclusions and crucify me, please go ahead. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m I&#x27;m used to it at this point. And your your words cannot hurt me. So, be gone.</p>
<p>All right. Where in the hell was I? Let&#x27;s get in. some sort of intelligence intelligent being that it&#x27;s nonhuman. Let&#x27;s just call it that. Uh and when Jay and I began knocking doors and trying to get access to the legacy program, there was an almost like an immune response trying to shut down by the legacy program.</p>
<p>Antibodies came out of everywhere trying to shut Lou and their efforts to bring out the truth down. And they tried to shut down hellput off too. They began communicating with science scientists involved in legacy program. But the leaders learned of this and shut it down aggressively. We actually had people angry at us that we were even asking the question.</p>
<p>How dare you ask these questions? You know, Mike, there&#x27;s ism, scientism, histoism, physicsism, all the different stuff that goes along and they have all the rules that are in place, right? If you bring if you go ahead and question those, they get really upset. How dare you question her stuff. This is the way the stuff is, &gt;&gt; right? That&#x27;s the same thing that Graeme Hancock was dealing with with Gobeci and all of the um archaeologists. &gt;&gt; Oh, and the stuff he was dealing with in uh if you want to call Egypt trying to get out the truth. No, sometimes they don&#x27;t want a truth that differs from what they believe.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s where the ism comes into play. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, let&#x27;s move on. Uh god, I need to make this a little bit smaller as we can see this. All right.</p>
<p>So, as you know, we we have the a right to do we uh what right do we have to inquire about this legacy program despite the fact we were running at which was looking into it. So they start looking into it. They get stuff flying around them and then they get the how dare you speech and there&#x27;s a legacy program. I guess Mike has been around at least 80 years at this point and uh to their thing is to protect national security and they refuse to give any information to us for that matter. It sucks.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to the Department of Defense coming from Christopher Melon, only Congress has a wherewithal to get the information out of the DoD and the way Cong the way to get Congress&#x27;s attention is first and foremost through the press. But I have to say, where is Congress taken us yet? Not far. Now, I actually h we got a couple other clips. Um, and we&#x27;re about We&#x27;ve got a ways to go in this, don&#x27;t we, Mike? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; oh, Jesus Christ. We&#x27;ve got a ways to go.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m going to give myself a little break. Um, uh, we&#x27;ve got a video that came out thanks to UAP James. Let me go ahead and bring this down. This is an interview with Lu Alzando. I guess they&#x27;ve been waiting for this for three and a half years to happen, Mike.</p>
<p>So, let me get to uh, here. Let me find um let me download. Let me give a link for this. Almost here. Come on.</p>
<p>You can get it. There we go. Maybe edit it down. May not be the full clip cuz UAP James usually edits stuff down. So, this is 5 minutes and 54 seconds.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go ahead and watch this interview with Luzando and Christopher Melon. How do we find out about this? Well, we follow Luwellando on Twitter and he put out a message everybody to say, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m going to be on Chris Coleman tonight. You know, we&#x27;ve been working on this for three and a half years. Let&#x27;s talk about it.&quot; So, on that note, let&#x27;s go ahead and I&#x27;m going to shut down the auto chat for a second and let&#x27;s go ahead and watch this video from News Nation. Here we go, folks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This documentary, The Age of Disclosure, tells you from But you cannot avoid the truthiness of this film. All right. You got left and right packing this thing saying the same thing. They know that there are things they don&#x27;t know and there is a reason they have been keeping that from you. Okay.</p>
<p>Whistleblower, executive producer of the film, Luis Alzando. Okay. Lou joins me and former assistant secretary of defense Chris Melon. Uh first of all, bravo. Bravo.</p>
<p>Okay. and well acquitted uh both of you. Um congratulations on the production as well, Lou. Um but uh I I appreciate you both being with me and I wish you much success with this as people can get it on Prime now and in select theaters around the country. Chris, let me uh use you though to start here with there is a reason the government hasn&#x27;t wanted to talk about this and it involves competition and their fears of being behind.</p>
<p>What does that mean? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; holy shit, it&#x27;s both. &gt;&gt; I would say first and foremost, uh, one of the largest barriers &gt;&gt; to, uh, conveying this information has simply been the, uh, stigma that surrounds this. That has been a huge block and a huge barrier from the outset. &gt;&gt; Uh, continues to be a problem. Uh, the movie discusses a competition between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>uh and alleges China as well uh may be in a race to acquire this technology and gain superiority, global aerospace superiority. Uh one of the shocking things uh truth of the matter is that that right now today uh and we had two fourstar officers on uh 60 minutes admit that we are unable to control our own airspace. We lost the use of Langley Air Force Base, which is where the Air Combat Command is headquartered, which has as one of its responsibilities the defense of the nation&#x27;s capital. And for several weeks, we couldn&#x27;t operate our leading jet aircraft from that air base. We still have no idea where those aircraft came from.</p>
<p>We haven&#x27;t been able to identify them. We didn&#x27;t successfully intercept any. That should be very alarming to uh anyone concerned with national security in this country. And that is just one one example of a dozen that I could roll off of these things uh invading restricted military airspace, our most sensitive airspace, and we don&#x27;t know where they from. We don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s controlling them.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t know how they operate. So this is something that the executive branch fully agrees with. Now there is no longer any debate, discussion, doubt about that fact between the executive branch or Congress. The the administration, the defense department all fully admit and acknowledge that that is true. So this film is, I think, helping to bring that forward because we need to we need a lot more action than we&#x27;ve had to date to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>Listen, I&#x27;m with it and I appreciate the point so much, Chris, especially coming from you. And I&#x27;ve always I guess my one beef is Lou, what took so long? And I know that&#x27;s totally an unfair question because you&#x27;ve been fighting this for so long. Uh but when people watch this, they&#x27;re going to be like, &quot;Wow, this makes so much s Why haven&#x27;t we been hearing this all along?&quot; And Lou, you have been fighting this fight for years. And what do you hope will happen now after this? &gt;&gt; Well, Chris, great. Thank you for asking that question.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s actually very thoughtful. And uh to me personally, this movie was a bit like uh forgive forgive the cliche, but a bit like birthing an elephant. Uh three and a half years in the making. Um but look, when you&#x27;re talking about getting over 30 separate senior officials both on the legislative branch and in the executive branch, think about this, Chris. Imagine 8 years ago going up to, I don&#x27;t know, a former director of national intelligence or a former director of CIA or a former secretary of defense and say, &quot;Hey, uh, by the way, we&#x27;re doing this little documentary film and, um, we&#x27;d like to talk to you on the record about UFOs.&quot; Um, they they would laugh you right outside of the room.</p>
<p>Uh, frankly, you probably tell the security not to let you back in at some point. Um, so the times have changed significantly and and this took time and and if you notice when you watch the video in the med the movie here, uh, there&#x27;s a lot going on. You literally have someone admitting for the very first time, a very senior ranking official that in some cases presidents and Congress are not briefed to some of these programs. Now think, let that resonate for just a second, right? What does that mean to the American people? That is a that is a that&#x27;s a holy cow moment. And I think if you want to to provide a documentary that has information rich with information like that and reveals like that, it takes time and people have to get comfortable with who you are and and really trust what it is you&#x27;re trying to do.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, you did it right. You you did it right. And I don&#x27;t want to give away too much of it because I want people to watch. But let me just say this. Once this gets its big wave, let&#x27;s come back.</p>
<p>Chris, I&#x27;ll chase you down. Lou, I&#x27;ll chase you down. and let&#x27;s have that secondary conversation that you guys are stoking with this conversation starter. All right. It&#x27;s a great film.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a public service and we&#x27;re here for it at NewsNation as we always have been and on my podcast, The Chris Cuomo Project. This is about transparency and Americans taking their government back. &gt;&gt; Right. But it really comes down to the truth, Mike. Getting transparency out of this is the hardest part because the federal government doesn&#x27;t want to give us any transparency on this because they&#x27;re afraid what information could potentially get to our enemies to let them know what we know about her.</p>
<p>And if they know more than what we don&#x27;t know, it could give them a reason for a preemptive attack on us. Because if they don&#x27;t know what we have and we don&#x27;t know what they have, who&#x27;s afraid to throw what at who? Because you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. I know exactly what you mean.</p>
<p>Yeah. But um &gt;&gt; they were talking on later in the film about how some of these craft like the ones that are a square inside of a circle, they are determining that it is something beyond time and space. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It sounds a lot like the video that we were recently going over from Greg O&#x27;Brien. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, it it&#x27;s nice to hear these people talking about these things that we&#x27;re dealing with here on the show regularly. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. It&#x27;s just one of those things we&#x27;re there. And Nick, I know you have your hand up and if it&#x27;s about going ahead and watching the Joe Rogan interview, we&#x27;re not going to. But what say you? &gt;&gt; Yes, it&#x27;s good.</p>
<p>But um like after the show, are you going to play a documentary, Thomas? I I&#x27;m not sure yet. I know there&#x27;s a bunch of places that&#x27;s out there for people to get it. So, I don&#x27;t want to go ahead and admit that I&#x27;m going to pirate anything, if you know what I mean. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, I know what you mean.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, let&#x27;s jump back into this conversation if I can. Let&#x27;s shut down. Oh, thank you, Chris. Appreciate that.</p>
<p>And thank you, Lou, and Christopher Melon. Let&#x27;s go ahead and find Here we go. Let&#x27;s get back to this again and pick up where we left off a little bit ago. Let&#x27;s get it. Let&#x27;s get into it.</p>
<p>All right. Uh, Congress attention is first uh access to press. This is about Okay, we need to get the press involved, but thank God we&#x27;ve got people like Matt Lazel that are out there that are actually pushing the press. I I know I hate to take a uh a derailment again, but talking about the UAPDA and talking about the press, uh believe it or not, uh Matt Lazlo got a statement today from Eric Bolson. Let me go ahead and bring this up here talking about yes, there may be a last stitch effort out there to go ahead and bring the UAPDA out and uh bring it back to life.</p>
<p>You know, I wonder if this is what they&#x27;re trying to do, Mike. Is something with this? I hate to say it. Is this something like they&#x27;re trying to go ahead and do? They&#x27;ve got the corpse in the corners and the legs start moving and they thinking that the patient&#x27;s still alive. We can bring it back. Hopefully not.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see what Eric Burlson has to say in this interview. All right, here we go. Should start about 30 seconds in. &gt;&gt; Doesn&#x27;t seem like it was ever formally. Do you know what happened with the UAPDA and NDAA? Doesn&#x27;t seem like it was ever formally offered.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I&#x27;m still trying to get it. Um, &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; There may be a last dying hope here. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Um, but I have to move quickly. Um, Chairman Rogers said if I can get the four corners to agree to put it into the NDIA, then he&#x27;ll put it in. &gt;&gt; Interesting.</p>
<p>But I just have to I&#x27;ve got to move quickly and get and get those members to agree to that. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s the four corners armed services &gt;&gt; of armed services and I think in so it would basically be eight corners. &gt;&gt; I know, right? &gt;&gt; Eight corners. &gt;&gt; So I&#x27;ve got that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a lot of people I&#x27;m going to have to make phone calls directly to. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Today probably. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s go get to it. &gt;&gt; All right. To say who in the hell is the four corners? Uh, four corners refers to the chair and ranking members of both the House and Armed Senate services and intelligence committees. So, they&#x27;re calling it the four corners, but it&#x27;s actually eight because you have a you have a chair and a ranking member going across.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that is four. Maybe there is eight, but either way, not bad for Matt to go ahead and see it. Is it really going to happen, Mike? I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath. It could be a lastditch effort to bring it there, but uh you never know. Could be that last Hail Mary pass like in the old Joe Montana game on the Sega Genesis.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, you&#x27;re right. That&#x27;s a good point, Thomas. Oh, yeah. Um, &gt;&gt; that was a fun game. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they they could try to move forward with this for the fourth time.</p>
<p>I have no expectations that it&#x27;s going to pass just like it hasn&#x27;t passed in the in the last three years running. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nothing changes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, don&#x27;t hold your breath.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Maybe we&#x27;ll get a present. You never know. But until then, because usually NDAA is signed off at the end of &gt;&gt; last week in December. &gt;&gt; Last week in December. But here&#x27;s the thing.</p>
<p>Hasn&#x27;t it already passed the House and the Senate in its current form? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it has. But it&#x27;s now going to have to um they&#x27;re going to have to try to sneak it back into the NDA. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to. &gt;&gt; But if they do that, they&#x27;re going to have to go back for approvals in the House and the Senate again. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; If they change the language, it has to go back up to both houses to ratify the changes that both h the House and the Senate are in agreement with him. If it is, then the bill can go ahead and go to the president and be signed into law. Yeah. All right. Let&#x27;s leave it off to the side.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go ahead and get back to the oh to our movie that we&#x27;re going off here, The Age of Disclosure. Yeah, more like what happens since 2020 uh for the last 10 years. Let&#x27;s move on. The way Congress&#x27;s tension is to get it through the press. Let&#x27;s moved on.</p>
<p>He knew he had to get the press engaged to help get the Hill engaged and to then get it back to changing the defense department. Where are these things coming from and how do they work? People want to know. That&#x27;s the question. What are they doing here? Why are they here? And the government wants to know how does their technology work? I don&#x27;t care how their technology works. Just go ahead and just tell us, you know, I don&#x27;t even care where they&#x27;re from.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re from this planet or if they&#x27;re from another dimension, if they&#x27;re from another star system. We just want to know what the hell are they doing here. All right, let&#x27;s move on. Here we go. Uh, Saloo and I strategize on how to come overcome the hurdle that&#x27;s trying to get the truth to come out, if you want to call it.</p>
<p>Uh, let me get back to here. See if I can click it up. All right. So, there really two choices. The first choice is make uh peace with silence by telling the truth about what he know about UAP.</p>
<p>And the second part was to actually leave the DoD like he did and resign. But I know if I could say just enough at the unclassified level to make the media aware and our government officials aware of the reality of the UAP topic, then Jay hopefully would be able to use that momentum to go ahead and achieve the goals that we set out to achieve inside the government. How can people hate this guy, Mike? I just don&#x27;t get it. &gt;&gt; No, it makes no sense to me either. &gt;&gt; No.</p>
<p>You know, they want to throw freaking Lou and everyone under the bus. And anyone who&#x27;s ever known Lou under the bus, it&#x27;s just like guy&#x27;s a freaking hero. Let&#x27;s be honest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you think an orb would burn me? Well, whoever just put that up, yes.</p>
<p>If there was a gravitational wave field, uh, a warp field around it and you got too close to what wasn&#x27;t in operation, yeah, you it&#x27;d probably get you. And from what we&#x27;re going to see later in this flick, you have about 7 years left to live cuz that&#x27;s the mortality after uh people have close encounters with a UA u uh UAP craft when it&#x27;s in operation. So if you did get close to one, set your timer and make sure you have a good health a health insurance pol life insurance policy. So the goals we set out to achieve inside the government and moves on in there. I don&#x27;t have the entire script, but it&#x27;s just the major well more than the major moments.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s such a profound disc uh decision for Lou to make himself and his family um actually uh to to put him at risk and during routine hellish commutes back home. How can any organization, institution, religion or government control that censorship or or govern or gatekeeper? We&#x27;re talking about another form of life that&#x27;s on our planet and our government has classified it. It just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Oh yeah, it does because of national security and they want to use that technology for war. No one has the right to keep the fundamental truths away from the American people, more importantly from humanity.</p>
<p>The there there&#x27;s a lot of coverage of news events of what happened, you know, when we had the first UAPF hearing in here, you know, talking about uh this is back in December 2016. This is a lot of a bunch of flashbacks. Say a Mike. Yeah, there is &gt;&gt; to all, you know, and now we&#x27;re going to start getting into Senator Rubio and Mark Warner. Uh, Rubio is now he&#x27;s the head of He&#x27;s the Secretary of State, isn&#x27;t he? &gt;&gt; He is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And he&#x27;s also in charge of the National Archives. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. He&#x27;s wearing two hats. &gt;&gt; And he&#x27;s the one when we had those UFOs that came and that were shot down initially over Dead Horse, Alaska. Then we had one over the Yukon.</p>
<p>And then we had another one down. It was down by Malstrom Air Force Base and then that one then eventually showed up over Lake Hiron where they shot this stuff down. He had he had said I&#x27;d almost have to hope this wasn&#x27;t I&#x27;d hope it was aliens because if it was the Russians who are Russians or China who had this technology, we&#x27;re screwed. Meaning they have technology that can avoid our radar, avoid our systems, go wherever it wants and we&#x27;re unaware of it. So that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re concerned about.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s move on. You know, to put national security above their own potential interest and careers, you know, the world was real and this was it was happening. Getting back into some more news clips and then we&#x27;ve had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities and it&#x27;s not ours and we don&#x27;t know who it is. That&#x27;s concerning, Mike. They&#x27;re over our nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re over our military bases. They&#x27;re over our our missile bases and stuff. Um, it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s a shit show. &gt;&gt; Well, we can&#x27;t track them. We can&#x27;t shoot them down.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s nothing we could do about it. They could completely violate our airspace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Over military bases, over nuclear facilities. And not a damn thing we can do about it.</p>
<p>Not a good sign at all, Thomas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hear you, Mike. I hear you. Let me move on from this.</p>
<p>All right. Go back to here. Let&#x27;s move up. And that alone, that statement alone deserves inquiry. It deserves attention, deserves focus.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully as the Secretary of State with his ability to put things into the ear of Donald Trump, he&#x27;ll do something. Of course, we have Kirsten Gillibrand saying it&#x27;s a problem because it could be China or Russia or even Iran. She&#x27;s always framed it as it being something from humans, not somebody else. and she eats up anything that arro comes, which really points out, Mike, she is part of the cover up problem. &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s definitely not a good sign, Thomas.</p>
<p>I can tell you that. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Right. So, she&#x27;s like a debunker. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We got James Clapper. Uh, who&#x27;s Oh, yeah. You know what? She&#x27;s like the people who attend the debunkers uh spaces. Let&#x27;s call it that. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; More of them. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. We know they do. But now, J Clapper, who was director of national intelligence, and he was also an air force OSI, I think, back in the day, he said, &quot;Well, any unexplained phenomena could pose, take your shot, folks, a national security threat.&quot; Um, there&#x27;s something violating our airspace.</p>
<p>Uh, US Representative Mike Gallagher from Wisconsin. Uh, we&#x27;ve got Mike rounds because of n because for national defense purposes, national security, we need to know what these things are. Jay Stratton presents a safety of flight concern for all military and civilian aviation. Mike, how many uh planes to date have been brought down or collided with a UF an actual UFO? &gt;&gt; Zero. right now.</p>
<p>We did have a weather balloon at a commercial airliner recently, but that was a weather balloon. So, they keep on bringing up, &quot;Oh my god, it&#x27;s a flight safety risk.&quot; I disagree. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m skeptical. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m going to go ahead and say it&#x27;s a flight safety/training risk.</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t train our airmen how to deal with this stuff with a knowledge that&#x27;s been learned and it&#x27;s been stigmatized and you actually don&#x27;t give them the knowledge they need when they interact with this stuff, they&#x27;re not going to know what the fuck to do, are they? And it&#x27;s not just our military pilots, it&#x27;s our civilian pilots. Anyone who&#x27;s going to be in the air, they need to have a class of UFOs 101. what to do. Just keep on flying. Ignore that it&#x27;s there and it will go away.</p>
<p>And if it comes close and you can&#x27;t handle it, just close your eyes for a second. It won&#x27;t impact because I think there&#x27;s more of a risk of like we got a commercial airliner. They see a UFO coming. They go do a crazy dive to get out of the way. They&#x27;ve got all those passengers back there.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re going to be flying and bouncing around the cabin and getting hurt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, easily. You&#x27;re right. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And also he&#x27;s saying the fact that the a FAA isn&#x27;t tracking UAP. Yeah, they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not tracking UAP because they&#x27;re just tracking what&#x27;s in the sky these days with transponders, Mike, they&#x27;re not actually using radar anymore. So no one in the towers, anyone observing any of this stuff. Nobody can see this stuff in the even in the military. It&#x27;s the same way.</p>
<p>Their technology may pick it up, but when it gets down to their screens of what&#x27;s coming across, Mike, their view of what&#x27;s in the sky is completely filtered. &gt;&gt; Well, they&#x27;re deaf, dumb, and blind, it seems like, in regards to these objects. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not much they can do about any of it. &gt;&gt; Shows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not. So, let&#x27;s continue on here. Is putting American, you know, is this putting American lives at risk any day? &gt;&gt; No, I don&#x27;t think so. I think this is just another statement to make it sound more sensational to get people to go after it. Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it putting at risk? Yes. I would say what&#x27;s putting our American lives at risk every day is the failure of the FAA and the military to train our pilots. If you don&#x27;t have that safety meeting, they&#x27;re not going to know how to operate safe safely when they encounter these craft. It&#x27;s no different than telling them, hey, when you you know, how do you deal with ge flock of geese? How do you deal with all these, you know, weather? How do you deal with uh thunder and lightning or uh you know, uh uh massive downforce winds? It&#x27;s all the stuff they need to learn from. And you know what? If they all have to they all have to learn and take simulators every so often, they could put this built into their simulators and make sure the people who are flying know how to get past this stuff.</p>
<p>So again, this is the fear porn that comes out there that gives them one of the reasons to get there. But uh I think it&#x27;s more fear porn than anything. Let&#x27;s continue. All right. So, then we get Brett Federson who was a director of aviation security and the National Security Council and uh comes down basically says he believes we&#x27;re absolutely not alone in the universe.</p>
<p>The biggest thing that concerns me with the UAP is the national security concern. Do a shot folks if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re playing along. That keeps me up at night and the idea that we&#x27;re behind the power curve. Well, what&#x27;s wrong with that? There&#x27;s something here that&#x27;s bigger than us. Is there anything? Is it Is it that bad that there&#x27;s something here that&#x27;s bigger than humanity, Mike? I don&#x27;t think so.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, you&#x27;re right. But if they&#x27;re worried that we&#x27;re not on the top of the food chain, they want to be able to be prepared for that on their own level. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But this is more about safety in the air. But yeah, if we&#x27;re not part of the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yep. I gotcha. Yeah. That means if they&#x27;re the apex predator, and we&#x27;re not, we eat everything on the planet.</p>
<p>Trust me, I&#x27;ve seen all the videos of countries around the world and all the things they eat. That means we must taste pretty good, &gt;&gt; like chicken, I hear. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you never know. Uh, and a third hypothesis of obso absolutely obviously that this stuff is interdimensional. Yes, it may not be coming from our reality.</p>
<p>Maybe it not be coming from a star system way the heck out of there. It may not be from the oceans and stuff. It could be they&#x27;re in the oceans right now with a base, but they could be warping in and out like we saw of the craft the other day uh from the videos we got from Gregor O&#x27;Brien that we&#x27;re looking at something that&#x27;s visible for 130th of a second and you&#x27;ve got this big massive structured thing that&#x27;s there and it&#x27;s gone. Yeah. Well, invisibility.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get to it. All right, let&#x27;s move on. All right. uh the belief in an adversary or whoever could not do something because it&#x27;s never been done before. You can&#x27;t just write it off.</p>
<p>The US thought it was safe for those ships in Pearl Harbor because we thought the Japanese couldn&#x27;t get there and their uh torpedoes on their submarines weren&#x27;t active enough to be able to shoot into the harbor on in Hawaii. And of course, we&#x27;ve got the hijacking of commercial aircraft in 9/11. And I believe Lou in the past has compared what we&#x27;re dealing with right now with the dis with the non-human intelligence. It&#x27;s equivalent to the national security risk of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor combined. And I think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to get here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I really hope not for our sake. If it goes in that direction, it would be really bad. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but that&#x27;s what Lou&#x27;s been saying forever. And and it could be. You never know.</p>
<p>Okay. Where I took military pilots to tell them the story encounters of UAP. All right. So, this is where Lou gets into the five observables. Hypersonic velocity, instantaneous acceleration, low observability, transmedium travel, anti-gravity.</p>
<p>But there&#x27;s a sixth one here. Biological effects. That&#x27;s, you know, the observables, sudden change in velocity. We&#x27;ve got uh Tim Glet that popped up for a little bit here to talk about this and he was actually talking about the uh actually Jay Stratton was talking about the Puerto Rico case. It&#x27;s again it&#x27;s one of the best videos we have and if anyone else there wants to get into a deep dive of what was going on the Aquade of Puerto Rico case go ahead and check out www.uap theory.com.</p>
<p>It is the by far the biggest most comprehensive tear apart on a frame by frame basis done by a whole bunch of scientists analyzing and giving us the information about what took place in Auadia. They go into the into the uh gravitational warp field, what&#x27;s going in the craft and some of the stuff we&#x27;re going to see later in this is actually based on their work. So it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s a great place. They talk about duplication and visibility, all the kind of stuff these craft can do. So, uh, let&#x27;s move along a little bit.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, the six observable biological effects. Now, this is where we&#x27;re going to get into our dear friend, uh, Gary Nolan. He got started working on this in the office. And, uh, you know, one of his patients he was dealing with was actually Mike, uh, Flattery, a US Navy and Air Force intelligence officer, and he was actually part of the UAP task force. He spent time and uh he he has experienced biological effects of encountering UAP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately um those of us who was investigated it were and were part of the investigation. Uh actually here we said let me get back to this. We be those who were investigated became part of the investigation more importantly investigated by our colleagues. Um, and those people who actually um I if you want to call it got close to the UAP had about a 25% mortality rate and I believe that&#x27;s a 25% death rate, right, Mike? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; I think that&#x27;s a little high.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Within 7 years of having interaction. So 25% of the people who had an interaction with UAP within seven years they&#x27;re dead. Yeah, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a really ugly statistic in my opinion. &gt;&gt; I know. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Uh probably important the public understands that this is more than just an aerial phenomenon. Now, we&#x27;re going to start to go through the different years, 2020, 21, 22, 23, and what&#x27;s taken over the last several years. Um, I guess uh Jay Stratton gets into talking about a a whole government inter agency effort that ultimately became the UAP task force. And if we look back, Mike, at the UAP task force, that was the last time we actually got good information out of the federal government before it came became ARO, &gt;&gt; right? Because they were doing good work and they took it seriously. Jay Stratton did.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. And also he was the one that recruited David Grush &gt;&gt; to investigate. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; That work. I know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it was at that time we were getting decent information out of the government. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Absolutely. And the program was much bigger than ATIP ever was and he handpicked members from all 16 agencies in the intelligence community and everyone in authority was paying attention to the topic.</p>
<p>One distinctive moment uh was when he actually was brought in to uh brief the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Munchin, who I believe he was the Secretary of Treasury during Trump, wasn&#x27;t he? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he was. &gt;&gt; So, briefing the Secretary of the Treasury, you know, he sat back in the chair and he said, you know, Jay, you may wonder why I&#x27;m asking for this briefing. He said, &quot;What are the economic impacts of the president going to the microphone and telling the world we&#x27;re not alone?&quot; This could be one of the reasons Hal Putoff talked about this later in the flick and a bunch of people, everyone always says, &quot;What&#x27;s the implications of the president disclosing where we&#x27;re at?&quot; It would be it would impact all of our normal societal norms like when we went through the pandemic &gt;&gt; temporarily people would be &gt;&gt; dealing with things differently than they normally do daytoday and the government has known this since the 1950s. They&#x27;ve done research on this and they&#x27;ve come up with the same conclusions. If the public found out, at least initially, it would be a disruption of everything that functions normally.</p>
<p>And &gt;&gt; humanity, society, we&#x27;d be dealing with religious problems because it could throw a bunch of religions under the bus whether they like it or not. &gt;&gt; Not sure if that would be a bad thing, though. &gt;&gt; But let&#x27;s move on. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not a good thing. And the government didn&#x27;t want that to come out publicly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, Mike, in that in that in that point, they&#x27;ll never bring out the truth. Well, not completely, no, but they have been releasing this information for a while now, &gt;&gt; and we still have more on the way. So, &gt;&gt; well, we&#x27;ll see where it goes. &gt;&gt; Controlled disclosure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d rather have catastrophic disclosure in my opinion.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, just freaking open Pandora&#x27;s box and pour it out. let everybody see what&#x27;s truly going on &gt;&gt; and then then let the world governments &gt;&gt; um discuss and disclose why they kept it covered up for so long. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, all it&#x27;s going to take is one government to bring out the information publicly. As soon as that happens, all the other governments are going to have to answer to their society, their civilization, uh why they lied about this the whole time.</p>
<p>So all it takes is one &gt;&gt; and then this has the domino effect. &gt;&gt; It does my friend. &gt;&gt; It should be interesting. I know &gt;&gt; it certainly does. So if we have to think about these kinds of impacts in order to prepare if the president were to make that move, you know, we&#x27;ll see where it goes.</p>
<p>Now back to Lu Alazando walking along the to craft UAP legislation that was then taken by Marco Rubio and pushed. And you know, I didn&#x27;t realize that there was actually legislation for disclosure to get stuff going that was actually pushed into the Corona virus relief bill. I did not know that happened. This was a relevation to me. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re right.</p>
<p>And we didn&#x27;t know that because at the time everybody was freaking out over CO 19 and they weren&#x27;t paying attention to little tidbits like that. &gt;&gt; Yep. Apparently people were in the government because most pe the co relief bill was huge and it probably wasn&#x27;t read by everybody which usually kind of happens. &gt;&gt; Oh, it always happens. That&#x27;s most of the time in Congress.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. So &gt;&gt; the majority of the the bills and legislation they sign off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then of course actually so the corona uh virus relief bill actually &gt;&gt; Yeah. It then forced the Pentagon and the UAP task force to provide let me get this here uh written force of Congress and both classified and unclassified.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, correct. I remember that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, here we are. That was 2020.</p>
<p>Yeah. 2020 was the year of CO for that matter. It&#x27;s amazing we can say that word now and not get our stream taken down from YouTube. &gt;&gt; Oh, it&#x27;s about fucking time, Tom. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>So, the long awaited Pentagon reporting UFOs was finally released in 2021. We covered it live here and we had videos. We play this video many times of John Rackllet. Every single time we play this video though, we get a bogus copyright strike we have to face. So, when we talk about sightings, we&#x27;re talking about objects that have been seen by Navy Air Force pilots.</p>
<p>Frankly, there are a lot more sightings than have been made public. Uh they&#x27;re not from the US military or other advanced US government technology. This was the news that we had in 2021 compared to where we&#x27;re at now in the rule in the world ruled by the trolls and Susan Goff. Uh we had Chris Melon. Yeah, Chris Melon was on Fox talking about stuff and getting into it.</p>
<p>And then we had a few elected officials that got read into the classified versions of the report. It opened their eyes to the national security concerns surrounding the topic. Okay, if you&#x27;re playing along folks, do a shot. And we even have uh Mitt Romney talking about how frankly uh China and Russia aren&#x27;t there and neither are we by the way admitting that we don&#x27;t have this technology. No one else on this earth has this technology.</p>
<p>What the hell is it? Oh god. Then we had then we had John Kirby back in the day when he was part of the Pentagon. He was talking about it back and he said so uh who knows what might have been developed somewhere else. What we believe is that there was an unexplained aerial phenomena that have been cited and reported by pilots that these phenomena have in some cases had an impact on our training ranges, on our pilots&#x27;s ability to fly, train, and operate and uh stay ready. Um that alone makes it a national security issue we&#x27;re looking at.</p>
<p>Again, if you&#x27;re playing along, do another shot. You know, a very powerful disinformation campaign began at that time. It&#x27;s going really big right now in X. Let&#x27;s just say that the effort was destroy lose reputation and credibility full stop. And that&#x27;s what these fucktards over on X are doing on a daily basis, Mike, and their non-stop uh Twitter spaces and their posts that they put out time and time again trying to throw Lou under the bus.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s disgusting. He&#x27;s a hero. He&#x27;s a veteran. Why do they whistleblower? &gt;&gt; He&#x27;s a whistleblower Congress. &gt;&gt; And they always say we have to protect whistleblowers.</p>
<p>Oh, but not Lu Alzando because for some reason they think Lu Alzando would be out to get him that he&#x27;s giving orders to go ahead and go after these trolls. Fucking crazy, man. They need help. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; yeah, they do.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let&#x27;s move on. Uh Mr. Alzando had no responsibilities. Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Um they put so you know back in the day they were saying that uh Mr. Alzando had no responsibilities with regard to the ATIP program. Come on don&#x27;t do that. Let&#x27;s go up. Um Mr.</p>
<p>Lu uh Luis Alzando did not have any assigned responsibilities for a tip coming from our dear lady Susan Goff, a troll of the trolls. They actually told the American people that Lu Alzando did not work there. And that was an outright lie. And that&#x27;s J. Stratton saying that, not Lu Alzando.</p>
<p>Lou said, &quot;My family and I suffer greatly for it. And they&#x27;re still attacking his family. They&#x27;re still attacking his daughter in these horrible troll accounts on X, and it&#x27;s disgusting. &gt;&gt; It is.&quot; &gt;&gt; Harry Reid said, &quot;They go online to try and belittle Alzando and me and anybody else, which they&#x27;re still doing today.&quot; Yeah, but let&#x27;s remind the audience that Susan Goff has been through four presidential administrations and in the same position for over 16 years &gt;&gt; and she has a degree in psychological warfare or in the common vernacular scops. So that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re up against.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been dealing with for the past 16 years on this subject. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Miss Susan Goff, &gt;&gt; my son of a bitch. Let&#x27;s move on. So, so all this thing that going after Lou, what they don&#x27;t realize, this gives him the motivation to continue and to press forward. So, even as the trolls are still doing all this shit, they don&#x27;t realize, they think they&#x27;re going to try to get him to go away.</p>
<p>No, they&#x27;re just giving him the energy he needs to move forward. I understand it. &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. Yeah, don&#x27;t forget we had the 60-minute study about uh story about UAP that came and went. Didn&#x27;t do much.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, not really. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we Lou talked about interview. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Lou talked about the government already stated on the record that they&#x27;re real and they have. And I&#x27;m not telling you that. It&#x27;s the United States government telling you that.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right, Lou. And you know, Obama came out and said there&#x27;s footage and records of objects in the skies that we don&#x27;t know exactly what they are. Even even the frequent flyer the guy who earned all the frequent flyer miles to Epstein Island. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, &gt;&gt; Bill Clinton. &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s coming out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, that asking him about UFOs. Well, first of all, that&#x27;s a legitimate question. Now, you know, there are lots of there are lots of mysteries out there. It should keep us humble. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff we don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know, let&#x27;s get John Reckliffe, who&#x27;s now the director of the CIA. There have been sightings all over the world and when we talk about sightings the other things I what I will tell you is it&#x27;s not just a pilot or just a satellite or some um intelligence collection. Usually we have multiple sensors that are picking up these things. Even Averil Haynes, she came in and she was a director of national intelligence under the uh Biden administration. She was in the National Cathedral right after she had taken office and she talked about wanting to bring it up and she said there&#x27;s always the question of is there something else that we simply don&#x27;t understand that might come extraterrestrially and her mission when she came in was to go ahead and shut down the overclassification because that&#x27;s what the among the intelligence agencies and the DoD that that&#x27;s her job.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why they created the national the director of national intelligence Mike after 9/11 they created this position for her that she held right to go ahead and make sure that stove piping that information that was covered up wasn&#x27;t covered up and we had the information sharing that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on. And you know what they did? They shut her down because they saw her as a temporary person that&#x27;s a politically appointed office and they&#x27;re like, &quot;We&#x27;re we don&#x27;t have to listen to her. She&#x27;s here and she&#x27;s gone.&quot; And they, as uh Lou explained it, what do you call it? It uh it was uh was administrative suicide or something like that. Basically doing whatever they could to stop her from getting the information and to stop the overclassification that was going on. They got John Brown.</p>
<p>This is interesting. This is the interview where John Brennan, right, has got his hand over his head and just talking about this because of the weight &gt;&gt; of the conversation is what he&#x27;s talking about. And this little clip that uh came from, oh god, we covered this one when it came out. And he had said, it&#x27;s not arrogant for us to believe that there&#x27;s no other life form any anywhere. And I only got one clip of this when they go into that clip from that period of time, but it was really hit him hard to talk about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Um, John Brennan says, &quot;I I&#x27;ve seen some of those videos from Navy pilots and I must tell you that they&#x27;re quite eyebrow raising.&quot; There it is. There&#x27;s the hand. And um, might in fact be some type of phenomenon that is this is the result of something that we don&#x27;t yet understand. and that could involve some kind of activity that some may say constitutes a different form of life. Now, this is how he was when he was saying it, which really showed it was really hard-hitting.</p>
<p>And yeah, Brennan and all these other people who all signed the papers saying yes, Bunner uh Hunter&#x27;s laptop was Russian disinformation. He signed off on it. Clapper signed off on it. A bunch of them did. But when he talked here, Mike, this was different because you could see the weight of the conversation on him really ripping him apart.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because at that time that he was talking about this, it had nothing to do with partisan politics. He was bipartisan on this subject because he felt it was real and it was a threat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I understand exactly where he was coming from.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. If we could, folks, just want to give you a little uh reminder. Hey, if you haven&#x27;t gone ahead and give us a thumbs up, we&#x27;d appreciate a thumbs up. If you&#x27;re not having a good time, give us a thumbs down. But tell us some comments in the show.</p>
<p>More importantly, we&#x27;ve got 41 people watching the show right now with 202 likes. But I tell you what, if you&#x27;re enjoying the broadcast, you aren&#x27;t a regular disc uh subscriber to disclosure tonight. We&#x27;d love to have you as a regular here, folks. So, let me continue on with this. So, again, hard-hitting interview.</p>
<p>This is the most different you will ever see him in any kind of a conversation talking about this stuff. So, let&#x27;s move on. Uh, back to hell. Put off. Some people who are into physics of time travel think, well, maybe they&#x27;re time travelers.</p>
<p>You know, potentially some sort of protohuman that somehow branched off from human humanity&#x27;s tree a long time ago. I&#x27;ll put off calls it maybe some ancient civilization that sequestered away somewhere on Earth or on the seabed. I&#x27;ll say under the seabed because that&#x27;s the safest place on the planet to survive the cataclysmic action that happens on a regular basis that encourages the great forgetting of humanity as we continue to forget and think this is the first time we&#x27;ve been through this thing. So, let&#x27;s move on. Uh we&#x27;ve heard testimonials from pilots as well as civilians coming back from uh Andre Carson again from different countries having seen things coming from the ocean.</p>
<p>These are otherworldly things that are performing maneuvers that haven&#x27;t been seen. Well, they haven&#x27;t been seen because they&#x27;re doing stuff that we&#x27;ve never seen before. Lou gets back to it. In fact, we&#x27;ve tracked UAP underwater going at speeds, but without any of the associated signatures. You know, it gets into it from someone else saying, &quot;We haven&#x27;t explored 80% of the ocean volume.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve mapped the surface of Mars and and the moon to a higher resolution, and we don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on under the ocean.&quot; I have to wonder, is that on purpose, Mike? Do they possibly know what&#x27;s there and they don&#x27;t want to look? &gt;&gt; It could be &gt;&gt; cuz they they&#x27;re afraid of the answer. Well, it could be because also in the documentary they were talking about, like we mentioned earlier, they don&#x27;t want to release to the public information about something that potentially they can&#x27;t do anything about because then that would cause panic. So, the best thing you could do in a situation like that is to keep your mouth shut. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, I need a &gt;&gt; It seems like that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been doing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I need a cover. Hans says, &quot;I don&#x27;t think aliens are really alien.&quot; Coming from someone who I&#x27;ve talked with many times who went through a horrid, horrid encounter with a non-human intelligence is these things are not human. Do not take anything that represents any kind of emotion, feeling or anything and equated to these creatures because they call them alien because they couldn&#x27;t be so much different from humanity. They are just what they are. You could call them good.</p>
<p>You can call them evil. No. Yes, this could be their planet and probably is their planet. I just want to let that out there because whenever I see that, you just got to remember, well, you could think they could be from here, but from dealing with someone who actually dealt with one of those grays, uh, uh, if you want to call it one-on-one, he was paralyzed. He was on the ground.</p>
<p>He was seeing, he couldn&#x27;t move. And one of them came up and put the their the fingers over the eye. Came in with something that looked like a knitting needle and put it up around his eye and and pushed it past his eye. He could hear the crunching of his skull as it went back as something was pushed into the back of his skull through his brain. So yeah, not human, not good in the clo.</p>
<p>Now there may be good ones out there but again just we cannot take human traits, human emotions and stuff. I would say dogs are more human than these alien things. It&#x27;s just what they are. Jay, you have your hand up, my friend. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just going to say that um it&#x27;s just like that we have here on Earth.</p>
<p>Okay. you have different cultures from all over the world that have different aspects of their religion as well. So you you have to see other other um and and plus we have all these different things on the planet. We&#x27;re not all the same. So we don&#x27;t all agree on the same thing.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the same thing with them. Um the same thing could be true anywhere. You can&#x27;t call them good, bad, you know. I I I figure it it depends on the situation that you either find yourself in or around. And that&#x27;s what you know it it happens and it&#x27;s either good or bad.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, if it&#x27;s described as we&#x27;re not we&#x27;re not uh the apex predator on this planet, what does that say? Does that sound like something good? &gt;&gt; What they&#x27;re doing as far as the abductions then because of the fact that um what would we do when we first go to a new planet? Oh, let&#x27;s see if those animals there are healthy and everything. Let&#x27;s tag them. Let&#x27;s do DNA testing. They&#x27;re they&#x27;re doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; Oh, let&#x27;s go ahead and recreate them in our image.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, they they could do I mean, as far advanced as they are, they look at us as a speck of dust in the highway. And &gt;&gt; we But we don&#x27;t know. This could be their planet. This could be their zoo.</p>
<p>It could be their farm. And we&#x27;re just part of the stuff that they deal with here in whatever they&#x27;re doing with Earth because it&#x27;s probably is their planet. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what I wanted to say, Thomas. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jay. I appreciate that. Great conversation. All right.</p>
<p>Lou is saying it&#x27;s not possible that whatever we&#x27;re seeing isn&#x27;t from there. But it is it from down there. We&#x27;re looking at entire world underneath the water potentially and don&#x27;t want to be detected. It would stay in the ocean. Yes, it would stay in the ocean if you don&#x27;t want the stupid humans to get to you.</p>
<p>But again, they&#x27;re all missing the point. It&#x27;s the safest place to be on the planet if you want to have a long-term society or long-term occupation of the planet, right? Where do you go to where you&#x27;re not going to get wiped out every time? Underneath the ocean. Not on the seafloor, but underneath it. All these possibilities will come with different intentions and motivations. Whoever it is, they&#x27;re here and they&#x27;re operating here.</p>
<p>Now, we&#x27;re going to get to the year 2022. Just three years ago, and L&#x27;s talking about in 2022, we started pushing Congress hard to hold the UAP hearings. We get some news coverage of what they&#x27;re talking about. Hey, look. We got good old Anna Pelina Luna and she&#x27;s not wearing her stars and stripes swimsuit perfectly.</p>
<p>Out of everything in Congress and everything happening, the UAP topic has been one of the only topics that&#x27;s received this level of bipartisan support. God, Mike, did she ever go ahead and subpoena Lu Alzando like she said she was going to? &gt;&gt; Oh, fuck no. Because she can&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was all bullshit when we covered that. I would call it being more of hormones and bullshit.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; For those who are married, you know what I&#x27;m talking about, right, Mike? &gt;&gt; Oh, we do. &gt;&gt; Oh my god, we do. All right, let&#x27;s move on. Uh, it&#x27;s not just an issue at least of yet in this country. Uh, get Mike Gallagher again popping in.</p>
<p>Again, it&#x27;s the same folks coming in talking about this story from their point of view. It&#x27;s really interesting. Uh, Democrats and Republicans just want to understand what&#x27;s going on. and UAP are a potential. All right, if you&#x27;re playing along, Ryan, time for another shot.</p>
<p>UAP phenomena are a national security threat. UAPs are unexplained. It&#x27;s true, but they are real. This is coming from the first UAP hearing, and I would have to say it&#x27;s probably one of the best UAP hearings we&#x27;ve gotten. They gave us the most stuff in that initial hearing, Mike.</p>
<p>And I even realized this when Scott Bray were there and Ronald Moltry. Look who the fuck is right in the first row right behind him. &gt;&gt; Oh, Tim Burch. &gt;&gt; Timmy. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t real I did not know that. &gt;&gt; Yep. Right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s awesome. They need to be investigated and many threats they pose need to be mitigated and yet it seems to move in directions that are inconsistent with what we know of physics or science or more broadly. I love that expression on his face. There are, you know, I&#x27;m just been randomly catching screenshots as I&#x27;m going through this thing as quickly as I could to show it, but I&#x27;ve gotten some really interesting screenshots of people talking there. Okay.</p>
<p>Uh Scott Bra saying, &quot;There are a number of events in which we do not have an explanation. We have encountered unidentified aerial phenomena.&quot; Ronald Moltry back at the day. We are committed to a focused effort to determine their origins. Then why is ARO going and denying any of this stuff is real? Oh, because they want to keep the most real stuff covered up because we can&#x27;t handle the truth. But it needs to be classified at appropriate levels.</p>
<p>We do not want we do not want potential adversaries to know exactly what we were able to see or understand or how we come to the conclusions we make. Jean, take it. Yeah. Get ready to take a shot because I want to talk national security and the um that constant framing. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So what I find interesting is you know Russia doesn&#x27;t frame it in the same way when there are drones that can&#x27;t be identified and it&#x27;s you know most likely drone type technology. they just instantly blame the US. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When there is an unidentified when there is a UAP and this is you know in in the modern era let&#x27;s say in the the same time periods we&#x27;re talking about when there&#x27;s a UAP their reaction is if it is US they must have reverse engineered a UFO. So they don&#x27;t frame it in the way we don&#x27;t know what it is.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#x27;s advanced technology from the US B like that. They they have always been and it goes back to the 80s. They have always taken this a very straightforward approach. Even as far back as 1953, I found a a a radio broadcast in the u the public radio station, the state radio, where they were talking about this. It&#x27;s so ridiculous.</p>
<p>the US is saying maybe it&#x27;s Soviet technology. You know, that&#x27;s a stupid thing to say. Why would they say that? Because they were very much dealing with the same kind of phenomenon, too. So, you know, it&#x27;s this this masking of the UAP phenomena under and UFO phenomena under the national security umbrella that goes all the way back to RAW as well, which they decided to have this dual uh dualpurpose umbrella under which they were going to maintain the mystery and and get it into all of its nice compartmentalized little buckets. Yeah, I would agree.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Mike? &gt;&gt; I agree with Jean. I could tell you that George Knap, who went over to Russia when the wall fell, um, at the time, the Russian UAP reverse engineering program was called Fred Three and it was the largest on the planet at the time. And he said that they&#x27;re still in operation till today. &gt;&gt; So we know Russia was taking this very seriously. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; For a long time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they still at this point are continuing that work that Jean&#x27;s father-in-law was involved with back in the 80s. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and the modern equivalents, you know, somewhat the same there.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s a lot of they&#x27;re more state-owned, you know, corporations or, you know, their equivalents of the Lockheeds and the Boeings and all the rest of them um that are, you know, doing that type of or continuing that type of work today and the, you know, the program they started in the 80s and the relationships with the university systems still seems to be active in the same way. So, you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just an interesting dynamic how we decided to pursue it under this veil of of of secrecy and, you know, the the the path from ridicule &gt;&gt; uh to now trying to standardize it and get the discussion. I think it was even mentioned in the uh Hal Put mentioned it during the the documentary. &gt;&gt; You know, how crippling it is to science when you cannot allow scientists to do that. And um you know I think the result is a lot of the assessments I&#x27;ve done show the US you know between the US, China and Russia from all the open signals that we you know we can examine.</p>
<p>It looks like the US is behind in it. &gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly. I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more Jean. If we could get back to this try and push this along.</p>
<p>I want to try and get this done before we I got we&#x27;re almost going on two hours now. How about that? All right so let&#x27;s crank through this if we can. You know I brought put this in the chat. This reminds me of going through the old film strips back in the day. Exactly what we&#x27;re able to see, understand, or how come the conclusions we make.</p>
<p>Therefore, public disclosure must be carefully considered. Meaning that, yeah, they don&#x27;t want to tell us the truth because they&#x27;re afraid what&#x27;s going to happen when humans find out about this. Now, Lou says on a case-byase basis, the hearing was a historic bipartisan effort towards transparency. You know, Jay Stratton, I learned that the legacy program was quietly behind the scenes pushing back and they were creating bureaucratic hurdles uh that was approved. They actually went and they actually got in the way, Mike and Gene, they actually got in the way of the UAP task force budget and prevented them from getting the funding they needed in the DoD.</p>
<p>Although it was uh um if you want to call it approved by Congress, they actually found out a way to keep their funding to keep them away from what was hap happening. And he can&#x27;t describe it any other way. I was just angry. There&#x27;s a hidden hand that&#x27;s blocking all of these actions of the things that I&#x27;m going with a subversive government overriding the real government. And it&#x27;s almost like Gene, we have this fourth branch of the government.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got the executive, the legislative, the judicial, but there&#x27;s this other branch of government that&#x27;s out there that&#x27;s dealing with the non-human intelligence that is almost like it&#x27;s above all the other branches and they&#x27;re pulling the strings and doing whatever they want and they&#x27;re getting away with it. &gt;&gt; I think they somewhat call it the administrative state. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The deep state, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so bad we&#x27;re really aren&#x27;t going to make pro If it&#x27;s so bad, we&#x27;re not going to make progress. uh Congress began hearing from whistleblowers in a classified settings. They came to the realization of the existence of the legacy program which comes into detail. Uh I guess it&#x27;s been run by the CIA, the US Air Force, and of course what we&#x27;ve been talking about forever, Mike, the Department of Energy. Let&#x27;s get into it.</p>
<p>And of course, defense contractors. If you look at the legacy program, it&#x27;s headed up by the CIA. the defense contractors are there to go ahead and hide stuff because you can&#x27;t get information out of them. You can&#x27;t get a foyer and you&#x27;ve got the Air Force which can be foyed. But what&#x27;s more interesting is the DOE is actually locked down tighter than potentially defense contractors.</p>
<p>And that&#x27;s where a lot of that heavy duty work is going with. You know, they&#x27;re talking about the directory uh the deputy director of science and technology at the CIA. He&#x27;s the guy who holds the purse strings because he&#x27;s been there for like 20 30 years. the person who comes in and runs the CIA and as an elected position, he&#x27;s just a temporary employee and maybe cannot get to the stuff that this position could bring out as truth. You know, he controls the UAP crash retrieval portfolio.</p>
<p>Uh then we got the US Air Force is responsible for field operations. We&#x27;re talking about recovery programs, &gt;&gt; retrievalss, &gt;&gt; crash retrievalss. Exactly. These are the folks that are responsible for deploying within a minute&#x27;s notice. anywhere in the world to go secure and retrieve crashed UAP.</p>
<p>We have intelligence teams that are quickly notified if there&#x27;s a UAP event. The US Air Force uses their own special forces, but they also coordinate with other special forces in other branches of the US military. They&#x27;re so well organized that basically uh that they basically can go to a site, gather the material, whatever it is, and once in their position, they have the authority to classify it and therefore make any information about it unavailable to the public. And even admission that it even exists is unavailable to the public. They&#x27;re responsible for exploitation, reverse engineering.</p>
<p>They provided technical and advisory services. But last but not least, the Department of Energy. This is the hell hole where all of this stuff is locked up because the only way you can get any information out of the DOE is to have a sign off from the director of the DOE, the head of the DOE appointed by the president, the head of the CIA appointed by the president, and the president himself. Unless all three people sign off on it, nothing will be released to the public from the DOE. Again, um they&#x27;re the world&#x27;s experts in anything that&#x27;s related to anything either atomic or nuclear technology or anything that gives off radiation, Mike.</p>
<p>More importantly, any kind of a part of an of a craft that&#x27;s connected to something that gives off radiation. They have the right today to come and seize any of this from anybody without the need for any legal papers put together cuz they already have the power to do it. So everyone&#x27;s afraid of oh my god the UAP disclosure act that&#x27;s going to give eminent domain. Guess what? Don&#x27;t they already have eminent domain &gt;&gt; for national security reasons? They do tell &gt;&gt; for national security and because it falls within the realm of the DOE and they have the rights to come and take anything they want as long as it&#x27;s connected to something that has a connection with some kind of energy source like this. But don&#x27;t forget don&#x27;t don&#x27;t UAP put off radiation in their warp field that hurts people.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There you go. Anything associated with that craft is locked away. But there&#x27;s another advantage because the DOE has its own security classification system well outside of of the overview and oversight if you will traditional classification systems like the DoD, the intelligence community and they&#x27;ve used security and classification language that came around Mike in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Which let them locking down and they&#x27;re basically saying this is more top secret than the original Manhattan project ever was. Well, we heard when David Grush did the interview with Jesse Michaels, he was talking about how the original Manhattan project was also dealing with UFOs at the time or UAP. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they were coming over Los Alamos a lot.</p>
<p>There was one time they had over 200 sightings in a number of months in one of the summers when they were working on the atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; Right. And that&#x27;s how they were able to keep a a tight lock on this before the 1947 National Security Act. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s true. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, I know &gt;&gt; been going on for some time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, Andy, you have your hand up, my friend. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, as it just popped up what what I said. You know, if um if anybody watched the last um James Natsky interview on um weaponize the Jeremy Corbell uh interview um George Knap interview, you know, James Natsky admitted he had a Q clearance with the Atomic Energy Commission. &gt;&gt; Well, you didn&#x27;t say it was for the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>He just said he had a Q clearance and left at that. As soon as I heard that, I was like, &quot;Oh my god.&quot; And Jeremy Corbel was just trying to rush rush right behind it. But he didn&#x27;t realize what the hell a Q clearance meant which means that craft he was working with everything that was he was seeing everything that was going on was all under the opice of the DOE. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Department of energy did a did a after um podcast a few days ago and he said yeah I admitted you know watching back watching it back.</p>
<p>Yeah, I I shouldn&#x27;t have talked over him, but yeah, I saw that he he had basically admitted what he&#x27;d done. So, you know, he&#x27;s he&#x27;s he&#x27;s laid it out there for everybody to see that, you know, but &gt;&gt; but he had this clearance for for people to start digging those those who&#x27;ve got the ability to. &gt;&gt; And apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who talks over other people. So, I feel better now. &gt;&gt; All right, great points, Andy.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lassky interview. It&#x27;s a 10 out of 10. Let&#x27;s just go ahead and say that. Let&#x27;s move on. Uh, whoever &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoever discloses restricted data shall be punished by death or imprisonment in the Atomic Energy Act to hide the legacy class crash retrieval program. Oh wow. If you reveal anything, no wonder why Latsky is being careful about what the fuck he&#x27;s talking about because the language already is there. He is it&#x27;s punishable by death or imprisonment. And it&#x27;s been like that since the Roswell crash.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, this is since 19 uh since uh the Atomic Energy Act of 1952. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But in 47 in 47, couple months after Roswell, we got the National Security Act, the CIA, and the Air Force. And their job was to deal with the non-human intelligence up front. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There we go. &gt;&gt; So, every piece of information we&#x27;ve gotten has been either a direct or indirect result of the US government &gt;&gt; out to the public. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All of it, including Roswell. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Appreciate people coming to the show tonight, watching this. We&#x27;re just about through this. Oh, God.</p>
<p>How much? Well, we still have a bunch to go. Want to finish covering this stuff tomorrow, Mike? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It&#x27;s a good idea. Yeah, because I probably have still another 50 70 slides to get through. &gt;&gt; Yes, tomorrow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That&#x27;s right, folks. Uh, wow. Great show. Great time with everybody.</p>
