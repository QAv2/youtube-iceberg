host faraji Muhammad thank you so much for tuning in and being a part of the conversation again folks happy Monday thank you thank you thank you for tuning in for uh to us this week let&#x27;s jump right into the conversations we got a lot to talk about first and foremost if you haven&#x27;t heard President Biden has put forth to Congress his proposed budget on what he thinks that uh some of the top priorities in the country and this budget has gotten everyone talking folks from folks in an Institutional level all the way down to the Grassroots and President Biden is trying to change the game and trying to turn a page and providing a little bit more resources to dealing with the issues of inequality uh dealing with issues of racial Justice and so much more so we&#x27;re asking a question today is his budget good for Black America when you start looking at it and uh let me just share with you just a little bit of what the president is trying to do uh with this budget because his budget this year is going into a different direction according to the reports instead of proposing a uh uh his budget has went the opposite direction of what the expectation was instead he&#x27;s proposing a seven percent increase over current non-defense spending levels in addition to tax increases one thing that his budget is emphasizing is that the uh uh that there should be even higher taxes for the wealthy and so of course the Republicans are pushing back on that but he&#x27;s also spinning in a number a great number a great amount of money on other programs outside of Defense outside of Viva law enforcement putting more Pro more money into social programs and and many people I asked are saying that these are the things that really need to be uh accounted for a program such that speaks to infrastructure housing Social Services unemployment and so much more let&#x27;s go check in Now with uh Dr Jason Nichols who is the uh lecturer from the African-American studies department at the University of Maryland here to give us his Insight on President Biden&#x27;s proposed budget and more importantly answering the question is it good for Black America doc good to talk to you brother how you feeling my brother I&#x27;m feeling well I&#x27;m feeling good brother how are you oh I&#x27;m good man it&#x27;s Monday you know you know hanging out with you a little bit uh let&#x27;s talk about this bro uh this this budget here uh I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m trying to pull up these numbers here because this one of these numbers is is something I think is pivotal he&#x27;s putting a lot and first and foremost this is a a 6.8 trillion dollar budget this is a huge budget that the president has put forth to Congress already it&#x27;s gotten some pushback up naturally um but one of the big things um is that one it it slashes according to the budget that this is uh three trillion dollars in deficit slash in policies on deficit slashing that would happen over a 10-year period over a decade and and so when we have these conversations first and foremost about the importance of the budget we got to IGN we have to acknowledge the fact that this is over a long protracted period of time that if you want to know what the priorities of any Administration is look at its budget and if you want to know the impact of what an Administration is look at its budget talk to us about the significance of that first well I think again uh you stated it perfectly if you want to know where they&#x27;re putting their money and where they&#x27;re you know where their actions and their policies are going to follow you look at the budget and I don&#x27;t think that this budget is going to go very far in Congress when you have a republican-controlled Congress and they&#x27;re they&#x27;re looking to they&#x27;re even playing with total economic meltdown with the debt ceiling so they&#x27;re they&#x27;re willing to play with fire they&#x27;re not going to approve any budget that&#x27;s positive uh for black folks or for anyone else for that matter they&#x27;re they&#x27;re looking for fiscal austerity which we know doesn&#x27;t really work um I I will say you know this does come with tax increases and you know there are middle class people that are going to feel some of this I know they say they&#x27;re only going to tax people making over four hundred thousand dollars whether you&#x27;re middle class or 400 a family making four hundred thousand dollars that that&#x27;s Up For Debate depending on where you live uh I would say out there in California you&#x27;re probably upper middle class yeah I mean you&#x27;re still doing something out here doc you know don&#x27;t don&#x27;t get me wrong you&#x27;re doing it right anyway you&#x27;re doing all right but you you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re not you know you&#x27;re not bawling out of control now you know if you&#x27;re in San Francisco and you may you know you have a family of five no no no oh no oh no so you know we can talk about that but I think middle class people are going to get hit uh particularly in the stock market I know one of the things that he wants to do is tax capital gains more heavily but the the thing is I still think that&#x27;s important and I&#x27;m somebody who&#x27;s pretty well invested in the stock market but I still think that that&#x27;s really really important and I&#x27;m willing to pay those taxes because with capital gains taxes that&#x27;s the only way that we can legally tax the super wealthy we have to think about people like Elon Musk when he sells Tesla stock in order to buy Twitter you know he should have to pay taxes on that because he doesn&#x27;t make a traditional income so you can&#x27;t tax his income the same way he&#x27;s gonna pay nothing because you know what&#x27;s what does he even get a salary I don&#x27;t think he does no I don&#x27;t think he does either again the only way to tax the the super wealthy is to go after capital gains you could try what uh and I don&#x27;t want to get too technical but you could try what Elizabeth Warren talks about in tax and wealth but I agree with the Republicans having looked at it that that is unconstitutional and you will have to change the Constitution and you&#x27;re not going to get that out of Republicans you won&#x27;t even get that out of some Democrats because they&#x27;re super wealthy so the only way to really do this is to tax capital gains and tax the upper middle class and that&#x27;s the only way that the middle the uh the wealthy are going to pay their fair share in order to secure things that the president has said are his priorities Medicare Social Security and you got people saying no we just need to raise the age on Social Security now I broke this down in a piece I wrote for uh for Newsweek so let&#x27;s take Senator Kennedy out of Louisiana and Louisiana is a state that has plenty of black folks right you they want to raise the Social Security age to 70. the average black man in America lives to be 70.8 years old that means that you will pay into the socials of black men will be paying into the Social Security uh pot their entire working lives and not live long enough to actually benefit from it I think that&#x27;s unfair personally oh yeah oh and Dr Jason that is way totally unfair yeah absolutely unfair like you work all of your life you give so much of your time to uh you know to the company or to the country in some way shape or form and then you don&#x27;t even reap the benefits until not even your golden years it&#x27;s almost like your decaying years you know so you got you can&#x27;t even reap the benefits from it so you&#x27;re right you&#x27;re absolutely right right so I I&#x27;m really um I think the the Biden budget you know I haven&#x27;t gone through it you know line item but to me it looks like his priorities in terms of finding ways to tax the wealthy um and finding ways uh to uh protect things that affect black folks Medicaid Medicare as a matter of fact most of the black babies born in this country the health care for those mothers comes from Medicaid you know so we are not the not most I have to go back and look at those statistics but either way a large portion and so we need to protect those uh those entitlements for the working class making sure that people can get health care uh making sure that they get it in their golden years and when they&#x27;re delivering babies and throughout their lives we need Medicaid expansion which Republicans have uh gone up against and there&#x27;s ways to generate the revenue for all of that but Republicans are more worried about their donors you know than they are about the Working Class People in their states and in their districts yeah yeah absolutely absolutely look I I wanted to in crew I want y&#x27;all to check in and let me know what your thoughts are as we talk about President Biden&#x27;s budget here&#x27;s the thing because this budget is so big it&#x27;s got so much stuff that&#x27;s stuffed in it and and I know folks when Utah often talk about budgets when you&#x27;re talking about government spending it starts people&#x27;s eyes start to gloss over right Dr J so like people just be like yeah okay what does that mean what does that mean right so so how do people break this thing down how do we look at this from a quote-unquote Layman&#x27;s perspective to make sure that we understand where the president has put his emphasis um and then you know we&#x27;re going to take a quick pause and then I&#x27;m gonna share some other stuff but how do we how do we do that I I think we look at where I mean budgets are complicated but where the money goes is simple you know what I mean so like where are they planning on spending our tax revenue where are they planning on spending our tax dollars how are they planning on generating revenue and if it&#x27;s taxing working-class people then that&#x27;s a problem if it is uh sending it to to uh things that make us a healthier stronger safer Society then you know I think it&#x27;s a good thing I think of course Republicans are going to fight against climate change and all that kind of stuff I get that uh I don&#x27;t agree with it I think that this is uh an important crisis particularly for black and brown communities and I&#x27;m gonna do a Shameless plug and say you know look at my my interview or listen to my interview with uh Mustafa Santiago Ali where he talks about uh you know a green economy and where that could help black communities and how China climate change is affecting black communities but I would say you know we need health care that&#x27;s one of the reasons why black folks are dying so early why are black men are aren&#x27;t living past seven barely true you know so these are where our priorities should be we should see it as pro-black policy um I&#x27;m not you know I&#x27;m gonna go as far as to say Biden&#x27;s you know whatever you ain&#x27;t black another half you know I&#x27;m not saying that but I I am saying that uh where they put their money is where their priorities are and we need to recognize what will disproportionately uh impact and improve the lives of black folks absolutely absolutely we got to take a quick pause when we come forward folks let&#x27;s continue to talk about this President Biden&#x27;s but a proposed budget and its impact on Black America would love to get your questions take your thoughts in and uh diesel I see what you got to say sir I&#x27;m going to definitely uh break that up into the conversation folks stay with us we got a lot to cover as we check in with my brother Dr Jason uh Nichols Andrew stay with us it&#x27;s the culture here on the Black Star Network foreign [Music] on the streets a horrific scene a white nationalist rally that descended into deadly violence storms the U.S Capitol we&#x27;re about to see the rides what I call White minority resistance we have seen white folks in this country who simply cannot tolerate black folks voting I think what we&#x27;re seeing is the inevitable result of violent denial this is part of American History every time that people of color have been in progress whether real or symbolic there has been but Harold Anderson at Emory University calls white rage as a backlash this is the wrath of The Proud boys and the Boogaloo boys America there&#x27;s going to be more of this this country is getting increasingly racist in its behaviors and its attitudes because of the fear of white people the fee that they&#x27;re taking our jobs taking our resources they&#x27;re taking out women this is right field [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] pull up a chair take your seat the black

for Dr Jackie we&#x27;ll laugh together cry together pull ourselves together and cheer each other on so join me for new shows each Tuesday on black star Network a balanced life or Dr Jackie [Music] thank you [Music] folks welcome back to the show we have been talking to Dr Jason Nichols who is the lecturer from the African American studies Department from the University of Maryland as we&#x27;ve been talking about President Biden&#x27;s proposed budget is it good for Black America that&#x27;s the big question and I want to get back to my brother Dr Jason and I want to hear from you crew to let me know your thoughts on this situation you can hit us up you can post your comments on the chat on YouTube Facebook as we&#x27;re streaming on those platforms as well as of course on black star Network and of course on Amazon let&#x27;s go back into looking at this so one of the big things saying that you said and not just pose that question before the pause saying look if you want to look where the priorities are for any Administration look at where they&#x27;re spending the money because a lot of time these administrations have been spending money on things of Defense uh uh in most cases some cases like infrastructure building the physical roads and the physical uh settings of the country in different parts of the country those have often been the two big things um but diesel brought this point up you know when you look at how much money is being spent in Ukraine with the Ukraine Russia in uh uh War that additional money you talk about billions of dollars that&#x27;s being spent over there right how does that fit into the budget where does that fall and should us As Americans to show us as as constituents in this country should we push back and say hey Mr President yeah can you cut down on that where does that fit bro so you know that&#x27;s a complicated question I I will say this I mean of course I think I it gave me a lot of pause when I saw Ukraine getting hundreds of billions of dollars in military aid and then uh you know estimates say that we could end homelessness in this country with 20 billion dollars you know Houston and homelessness with just uh 20 billion dollar investment um so again I see the argument I do think that there is a danger in letting Russia go in and take one of the you know I think people don&#x27;t realize how large Ukraine is Ukraine is a really large country in Eastern Europe um letting Russia encroach upon that territory like Russia Empower itself uh right I think it is something that deserves attention from the United States and from the West uh particularly here&#x27;s the problem with that bro here&#x27;s the problem with this doc we as the American people we don&#x27;t know what the interests are for the United States to even get involved in that war I&#x27;m not one who says okay well we gotta know every single government step I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not that guy right because once you start to learn what the government is really doing in the name of the American people and in the name of democracy you&#x27;re gonna start to you you it go it goes down like that Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole right but in the case like Ukraine that really hasn&#x27;t been a um I mean I know President Biden has done a number of like uh of messages National messages where he talked about the need to support Ukraine but there still hasn&#x27;t been enough information from my vantage point for us to really say oh this makes sense because to a lot of American people and we talked about it on the show I talked about it with you and other folks Dr Gerald horn included it it the American people are still not totally on board if if the president if there was to something that happened in Russia in the Russian Ukraine conflict today and it was a such a dire situation that the president said okay we need boots on the ground from the American soldiers I bet you probably more than just more than half a majority of Americans would be like no we&#x27;re not here no no I would be like hell no you know what I mean that&#x27;s right right you know um could we you know can we invest first of all we&#x27;ve invested about five percent of our military capability last I checked five percent of our military capability in Ukraine and we have destroyed over 50 percent of the military capability of Russia which was like considered basically the third power in in the world the third most powerful military in the world and we&#x27;ve literally pretty much wiped it out to the point where they&#x27;re having to empty their jails you know what I mean they&#x27;re emptying their jails in prisons and saying if you fight we&#x27;ll give you uh Freedom you know they are literally hiring mercenaries like the Wagner group uh to go out and fight they&#x27;re conscripting people off the street if you are a Russian citizen a male Russian citizen they&#x27;re going to put an M4 in your hand you&#x27;re going to get two weeks of training and they&#x27;re gonna put you in the field and that&#x27;s because of the strength of the American Military military capability um yeah we invest a lot of money in it uh for this you know for this reason because we basically want to control the world financially and economically and militarily we want to be able to say to to Russia to India to China look you don&#x27;t you really don&#x27;t want smoke you know um but boots on the ground doesn&#x27;t really help we saw boots on the ground in Afghanistan and we lost that war you know what I mean we saw boots on the ground in Iraq and you know still I guess up to interpretation whether we won or lost that war we saw boots on the ground in Vietnam we haven&#x27;t won a war since since World War II um so when we put boots on the ground so I think we ought to just do what we do you know fund you know uh the you know this maybe this I how much funding I think could be debated um but you know helping the ukrainians and making sure that Russia doesn&#x27;t attack any NATO Nations because then we&#x27;re obligated to actually fight um making sure that we we maintain that red line I remember when when Ukraine first popped off people were saying well we need to establish a no-fly zone I was like you&#x27;re out of your mind because to establish a no-fly zone you have to establish air superiority how do you establish air superiority you have to fight and we&#x27;re not we don&#x27;t want to fight with especially Russia we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t need that fight uh can we let Ukraine you know borrow you know not borrow but take some some missiles and stuff like that um yeah I you know I I tend to be more okay with that but boots on the ground is out of the question I think Joe Biden realizes that he&#x27;d be insane right that would be the presidency we just got oh yeah no doubt we don&#x27;t want to go into war we literally just ended a 20-year war no you don&#x27;t want that he don&#x27;t want that bro he&#x27;s not stupid right no not at all let&#x27;s let&#x27;s talk about this for this this domestic Affair uh and I want to share what um the NAACP president and CEO Derek Johnson he released a statement last week talking about this budget um he said the bite enhancement administration&#x27;s proposed budget reflects many of our most uh um and this is this is um that&#x27;s about it look we want to take that quote down for me please can it that&#x27;s from the uh movement for black lives we can get to that in a moment bro but this piece here Mr Johnson said the Biden Harris administration&#x27;s proposed budget reflects many of our most urgent needs including health and well-being environmental justice education housing and long overdue policy solutions to close the racial wave wealth Gap so the NAACP is in support of this proposed budget just saying it is good for Black America because it deals with these long-standing systemic issues what I&#x27;m assuming on the flip side now King if we can post that quote bro thank you um the the movement for black lives put out this piece President Biden and attorney general uh General mayor Garland&#x27;s plan puts the lives of millions of black and brown people at risk by increasing the already women and violent police presence in our community despite bloated police budgets across the country crime continues to occur because the police do not keep us safe and they do not prevent north-stop crime pouring more money into the system of policing only threatens the very lives they&#x27;re perfected to protect what&#x27;s worse using covid-19 relief money to boost officer pay or fund oppressive police tactics when our communities are still struggling from the pandemic it is immoral but not unsurprising it is also slapping the face to the millions of black brown Asian and lgbtq plus people who voted this Administration into office in a historic wave of support in hopes of Shifting the material conditions of their families and their communities and then it ends that we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that our country is facing the same issues over and over again when what is put forward as Solutions are the same races dysfunctional and violent Solutions when we say defund and abolish the police mean exactly that we need policies or solutions that center community and investments in housing education good jobs and mental and physical health for all I think it&#x27;s absolutely interesting brother Jason that you got two organizations one is saying yes this is what the budget is doing the other is saying no this is not what the budget is doing and this is why I think it&#x27;s interesting that black Americans in the condition that we&#x27;re in just because it&#x27;s hard for us to see which page that we should be on what&#x27;s your take on that we got a minute left before we take our next pause but what&#x27;s your take on this on on seeing the disparity in both of these statements from movement for black lives in the NAACP I think there&#x27;s a generational Gap there um I think you know one place where I I disagree with the movement for black lives is I think we should pay cops more I think I&#x27;ve said that on this show um I believe that cops should be paid more because I can expect more from you and I can expect higher qualifications if I&#x27;m giving you a good salary so nurses teachers and cops I&#x27;m I&#x27;m with paying them more that at the same time I think we can still uh move funding into more Community centered ideas and policies and to make it a zero-sum game I think it&#x27;s a mistake on the part of uh the movement for black lives um I think the NAACP they&#x27;re almost a little two in the pocket of the Biden Administration and not recognizing that look there this budget isn&#x27;t perfect you know and um you know I think there&#x27;s also a philosophical difference between people who believe in community policing which means you know you&#x27;re going to have cops more police because they&#x27;re not going to be riding around in Cruisers and not getting to know the community they&#x27;re going to be out walking beats and getting to know the old lady on the corner getting to know the person that&#x27;s hanging out the window getting to know the kids in the community um and then there are people who believe that we should have fewer police altogether um I&#x27;ll tell you when I talk to a lot of older black folk they want some police presence you know what I mean hey look Hey look until we come up with a legitimate alternative we gotta we gotta deal with the system and we could do two things at one time at the same time we could walk into gum at the same time we can build a community policing infrastructure in our communities right with from various organizations you know of course from everybody from the nation to the church to everybody right and at the same time still do some reform because while we&#x27;re building our capacity police departments currently got the capacity to handle the thousands and millions of people that are in most of these millions of black people that are in these cities we can do two things at the same time we just gotta have a plan to do it I gotta I gotta take a quick pause doc when we come forward uh we&#x27;re gonna switch gears a little bit on from the budget let&#x27;s talk about Colin Kaepernick as we talk about the policing issues he did a CBS interview with shared with you a quick excerpt from that interview but he&#x27;s still putting it out there that he still wants to play in the NFL even though he&#x27;s doing all these other great things for the community what you said what do you think folks should he get off of the NFL and just kind of move forward or should he stay with where he is we&#x27;ll have that conversation up next here on the cold turkey on the Black Star Network [Music]

every week we&#x27;ll take a deeper dive into the world we&#x27;re living in join the conversation only on the Black Star Network foreign [Music] folks welcome back to the show uh we&#x27;ve been talking to Dr Jason Nichols um from the University of Maryland and I wanted to get the doc&#x27;s take on this situation with Colin Kaepernick and let&#x27;s bring doc back into the frame hey Doc uh your man Colin Kaepernick our guy who took a knee uh some time ago it&#x27;s like what six years ago how long was what was it yeah this is am I wrong for that no I think you might be right it&#x27;s like 2017 something like that 20 oh it might be it might be yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so he continues to put it out there that he wants to uh continue to play in the NFL and here&#x27;s why he just did a recent interview with uh with CBS News where he sat down with them to talk about his new book changed the game a book about talking about how he grew into his his understanding of self-awareness during his teenage years and he was talking about that but then the conversation about the NFL came up where the MVP said look I&#x27;m still training training five six days a week I&#x27;m still ready but here&#x27;s the thing he got a new documentary that he&#x27;s going to be putting out uh with a spike you know Spike Lee and he hasn&#x27;t reveal and this won&#x27;t be until the documentary he said but he said he kind of teased that why he decided not to approach the um that arranged uh uh um what was that the arranged practice that the NFL said back in 2019 yeah but here&#x27;s my thing on this doc I love the brother I really do yeah yeah now I&#x27;m with you just let it go yeah it&#x27;s over yeah you know what I&#x27;m saying look just let it go yeah you you legitimately have great quarterback I.E Lamar Jackson who&#x27;s still trying to figure out his situation right you know but then um then you have possibly bringing Colin Kaepernick back into the mix I I I think part of me is like Colin you&#x27;ve done your work in the NFL you&#x27;re doing it in a phenomenal job on social activism social justice in those spaces right I don&#x27;t think you should worry about going back into the NFL at this point only if here&#x27;s my here&#x27;s my suggestion doc you tell me this if I&#x27;m crazy I think you should only go back into the NFL if he plans to sit down with them and have a different conversation and say look let me work with Jay-Z your Inspire change initiative needs some upgrade let me create a space for future players current and future players to express themselves politically without retributional consequences from owners and and and teams and all of that stuff let me let me let me I want to come in on that end versus trying to be a player I think his days of being a play are open NFL it&#x27;s over if if he wants to make the change bring that same moment to bring that same energy and do it on the front end like I said you can work with Jay you could work with other people and say look we&#x27;re going to create a real legitimate outlet for players to to express themselves that&#x27;s the only way I could see him working with the NFL at this point bro yeah I can tell you right now one of the things you know in in media I can tell you if you sue one of the networks you&#x27;ll never work at that Network or any other network for that matter never again yeah they steer clear of you and Colin Kaepernick sued them he took the payout they&#x27;re not going to bring him back number one he&#x27;s been away from the game so long you got all these young college studs coming up you got guys who are playing in the XFL and the usfl who wanted who won a shot I just don&#x27;t think Colin Kaepernick is going to get an opportunity not only uh whether he can play or not whether he&#x27;s injury free or not he&#x27;s been away from the game for a little a really long time but one thing I will say is you know taking another athlete quarterback Who is very a very different person with a very different personality but I think about RG3 right RG3 was number one pick in the draft you know everybody thought he was going to be a great quarterback it didn&#x27;t pan out uh now he is calling games and doing analysis and he&#x27;s much better at that than he ever was at playing football so to me sometimes you learn your purpose you know it&#x27;s not what you thought it was you know and I think Colin Kaepernick has a greater purpose a grander purpose than you know running a football or throwing a football I think he has uh you know a greater purpose in in the in the world uh a better better lessons he can teach the world I know he&#x27;s passionate about football and there&#x27;s probably other ways that he can get back into you know football um you know whether it&#x27;s some he&#x27;s a pretty reserved person but he can do you know media there are other things that he could do that I think people would absolutely accept him and be excited about it but the idea of him coming back and challenging for an you know a position on an NFL team to be a quarterback it&#x27;s over that that that yeah and I I never understood this like you said he got the payouts he took him to court he embarrassed the hell out of the league right right essentially like once he did it yeah he went through all of the the the the scrutinizing he went through all the criticism he went through all of that and then a couple of years later the league started everybody started to say oh yeah he was right he was right he was right right I mean he did all these things and it&#x27;s like bro why do you keep wanting to come back to the same to the same situation that ostracized you that made you why why would you I don&#x27;t that&#x27;s the part I&#x27;m not understanding like why is there still this this this this desire to be a part of a system that you said is not good well I think part of it is he&#x27;s trained his whole life to be a football player and to be an athlete and he feels you know he wakes up in the morning he still feels strong he&#x27;s he can still throw the ball a mile he&#x27;s like I can still do this and he feels I think in terms of his career like he left something on the plate you know he didn&#x27;t eat his food he didn&#x27;t ever won that Super Bowl he didn&#x27;t get a chance to live out his career we saw Brady play for 75 years you know and he&#x27;s like you know I want my leftovers and to prove that Not only was he an activist but a great player I mean when you think about some of the activists that we&#x27;ve had in sports they&#x27;ve all been great athletes there&#x27;s always going to be that question mark around Colin Kaepernick you know was he great was he you know we never saw it so I think he still has that in his head you know I mean Muhammad Ali was great you know um you know when you go back to to uh um breaking the color barrier you know people forget that he was the he was the best player in baseball for about three seasons it was an MVP you know in all of baseball you know we often talk about Satchel Paige being better than him or we talk about Josh Gibson being a better hitter than him but when we look at it he was literally the best player in baseball so we with all of the great things you know of course Jackie Robinson was you know like I said great you know um Roberto Clemente great all the people that we think of it as activists were also great at their craft there&#x27;s always that question mark over Colin Kaepernick and he&#x27;s got the question mark I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t get to do what I could have done and he wants that opportunity again with all these new leagues popping up if he wants to play football he can play football would let him in but the NFL it&#x27;s over hey I was about to I was literally thinking that bro like and with all of these new leads with all these opportunities you can play football hell you can even coach football if you decided that that&#x27;s you know your path but I I&#x27;m with you there I think that at this point we and I&#x27;m saying we in terms of those who have supported the Colin all the way from the beginning at this point we should just be like all right well you know you had your run you know I get it you got some stuff left on the plate you still feel like you got some gas in the tank but at the end of the day based upon how the relationship has gone between you and the league yeah it&#x27;s over it&#x27;s not happening sir he&#x27;s done it&#x27;s over he could play into XFL you could play in the usfl right all right right and if he balls out there then he has a strong argument like I can still play you know but let me tell you Bishop yes [Music] pull up a chair take your seat the black tape with me Dr Greg Carr here on the Black Star Network every week we&#x27;ll take a deeper dive into the world we&#x27;re living in join

lights keep getting into the system bro but um I agree with you as you mentioned Colin Kaepernick brother is is I think his time in the NFL is done I would agree with you I think that for us we need to just say thank you thank you for your service on the field and we look forward to you all the great things that you bring to the conversation around social and racial Justice in this country so that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at right now with the quarterback and we will see but he got a documentary he got a new book called change the game he&#x27;s doing so many other fantastic things so Colin big shout out to you for continuing to put your message out there and more importantly uh you will never be forgotten in NFL history never will be forgotten Josh you got the final say yeah no I think I think you took the words right out of my mouth you will never be forgotten he is a legendary figure he&#x27;ll still be a polarizing figure because we live in a polarizing time of social media uh I think through time he will have more people on his side but uh he will never be forgotten and I think the NFL one day will make public amends but they don&#x27;t want him to play on the field he&#x27;s never going to play on the field in the NFL barring like like we said if he goes on and plays in one of these smaller leagues and just balls out of control then perhaps you know you got to give him a shot you got to start you know kick up that buzz but right now he&#x27;s you know he&#x27;s yesterday&#x27;s news he&#x27;s yesterday&#x27;s paper as far as being a player but uh what he did for social justice what he did for that discussion can never be minimized he is a legendary figure in the history of sports and activism absolutely absolutely Dr Jason Nichols is always a pleasure

of our segment called reclaim your Wellness with Dr Bridget Williams MD check it out [Music] Dr Bridget good afternoon sis how you feeling today great how are you faraji oh I&#x27;m good I&#x27;m good thank thank you so much for checking in and and I&#x27;m very very excited about today&#x27;s conversation you you got a couple of things on tap right absolutely so first of all thank you for having me today um we&#x27;re really talking about some really important issues and you know we&#x27;ve had these conversations where the black community in mental health is a really important thing for me that we we don&#x27;t get the services that we need we ignored the care that we should be getting and so I want to talk about this new study that came out from the Centers for Disease Center for Disease Control that looked at people during 2018 to 2020 they did a study and black people visit the ER for mental health at the higher rates than anyone else and so and this is really important so what they found is that they took a thousand emergency room visits and but basically black adults were going to the ER twice as often for mental health as white adults so looking at a thousand visits 97 of them were um black adults uh 43 were white adults and why this is important is because basically when they&#x27;re getting in there they&#x27;re not necessarily getting the care that they need and honestly in the long range of things that can even lead to death so what we&#x27;re looking at is black adults have a higher rate of emergency department visits for um all over mental health disorders substance abuse anxiety disorders mood disorders and schizophrenia and when they get in there they end up waiting um at least an hour long than white patients um I have seen it myself being in the ER I have had conversations with some of my white patients and being told how Disturbed they have been sometimes when they see a waiting room full of people and the white patients were being seen while waiting on the black people still sat there and I&#x27;ve gotten that from white Americans okay and let me just real quick what I thought is this something that is you know across the board is it is it or is it relative to the states is it relative to the hospital systems public versus private how does those how does those Dynamics fit absolutely so this is some this is a study that was looking just across the board between 2018 and 2020. and what they&#x27;re finding is that during this time um there&#x27;s simply a lack of proper care black Americans don&#x27;t have the primary care services that they should be getting and then a really important part of this is that there is a stigma when we talk about mental health right and there are cultural beliefs that still stay with us that we believe we&#x27;re strong that we dismiss the idea of someone being crazy and that we simply wait longer to receive care than white America does and when you consider that um when you go into the ER they are not your psychiatrist they&#x27;re not a Mental Health Organization they simply put a Band-Aid on what&#x27;s coming in and many times you&#x27;re more likely to be diagnosed with substance use or substance abuse then depression and writing being treated for that and so they put the Band-Aid on there and this is no disrespect for our ER doctors but it&#x27;s simply the function that they play so it&#x27;s very important that you get proper care from the right places and the fact of the matter is there&#x27;s a great distrust in our community when it comes to the to medical facilities and doctors and um the services that we could be getting because of a long history of mistreatment to be honest right at the same time our behavioral health and mental health systems are swamped with and we have limited resources so when you&#x27;re looking for your black psychiatrist even your family physician or your therapist sometimes it takes a lot more work to find the person that is right for you right and so why this is an issue in the long run is because what we end up doing and I&#x27;m sure we all know someone that fits in this category that we end up taking an opportunity where we have mental health issues where they&#x27;re you know disturbances stress anxiety depression going on and because we don&#x27;t seek medical care we end up falling into drug abuse self-treatment you know uh alcohol abuse instead of really getting the help that we need to feel better folks I want y&#x27;all to join us in the conversations I&#x27;m talking to Dr bridge and MD uh I&#x27;m crew I would love to hear what your take is about this uh this epidemic of mental health and ER and the ER visits post your comments in a chat section of YouTube Facebook of course we&#x27;re streaming live from Black Star Network and Amazon news uh but but Dr Bridget I mean this is this is very disturbing and again it adds to the many challenges that we face in this country systemically what are hospitals doing around coming up with better better measures on on uh uh you know getting getting patients registered or when they come in through the door is there a better process what are hospitals doing to to make sure that they can cut down on this time absolutely so I I can&#x27;t really say that there has been some dramatic push outside of a lot of hospitals are doing more diversity Equity inclusion type training um so that the employees have a better understanding of how to approach and treat um the patients that are coming in but one of the reasons why I find this disturbing because a lot of people say so what why why is it a problem going to the arm but if you look at the Trump era if you look at the covet pandemic the only racial group that had a decrease in suicide rates were as White America and so that I&#x27;m talking about 2018 to 2021 that uh the suicide rate for black Americans increased by 19 increased Hispanic Americans increased by seven percent while white Americans went down 3.9 percent and so and suicide is a mental health issue right right we have to do more we have to change how we think about this we have to pay more attention to each other if we&#x27;re really going to make a difference and save each other save each other at this point so my recommendation when we&#x27;re looking at this is find your health tribe look at what your priorities are and your mental health better be one of the top ones without a doubt if you don&#x27;t have that you don&#x27;t have anything no no you don&#x27;t have anything and so when you say your health tribe right because we&#x27;re in the age right now Dr Bridget you know what I know it everybody is a mental health specialist everybody want to give you their take on how they are living their best you know drama-free Carefree life right social media and everybody&#x27;s talking about oh self-care you know self-care Sundays and all of those things and I feel like these are great ideas these are great tips you know we&#x27;re taking a walk go outside um read a book you know exercise I think these are all great these are good stuff but I don&#x27;t think that it speaks to the very very deep personal pain that many people who suffer from mental health issues really feel you know what I mean like like telling yourself that you are okay in those daily affirmations is not going to be enough yeah and I think that it it has been used as a you might need to take some medication or you know there has to be some other stuff that has to be done but it just can&#x27;t be this kind of like oh okay I&#x27;m having a I&#x27;m depressed today and we use certain terms and we throw it around but as if it&#x27;s like oh I just had a headache like oh I was just depressed today but I&#x27;m better now and I&#x27;m trying to see like so how do we get through all of that that type of chatter to get to a person who says you know what I seriously think I&#x27;m I need some additional assistance I need some professional help they don&#x27;t go to social media and thinking that&#x27;s the the bone to get them healed absolutely and let me say that um sometimes social media is the problem right and that there was a great amount of anxiety and depression just related to Too much exposure to social media you cannot take an affirmation and cure your anxiety and your depression in itself it might be great and positive but you need to do some serious self-check-in I think we all had a huge wake-up call when um twitch ended up having um committing suicide I think that was you know something that hit a lot of us because on the social media side of things we see nothing right and so we need to do that self-check-in if you were feeling down depressed unable to be motivated having sleep issues anger issues appetite issues and this has been going on for more than two weeks consistently or um on a more moderate side for uh more than three months then you need to seek help if you&#x27;re concerned about well what does talking to someone mean if you&#x27;re seeing a good therapist it is not about sitting and share bring your talks it&#x27;s not the same thing as talking to your best friend or your girlfriend or what have you when you&#x27;re talking about quality therapy you&#x27;re talking about changing the narrative and changing how you&#x27;re thinking so that you can get out of the situation that you&#x27;re in and as much as sometimes we want to avoid Pharmaceuticals sometimes the Pharmaceuticals is what might help you the most and let&#x27;s not don&#x27;t allow the negativity or the downside of this or your impressions of what mental health means stop you from getting proper care all you can do is try so yes there everyone&#x27;s seen everybody&#x27;s a life coach right because everyone&#x27;s got a little life but a life you know uh does not does not necessarily take care of that and let me say that we do better when we are taking care by by our own and this kind of leads into that other piece there that even talking about infants black babies die at three times the rate of white newborns black doctors are involved in mortality rate Cuts in half we do better when we take care of ourselves and so I guess if you&#x27;re talking about my medical recommendation see your black therapist your black doctor your black psychiatrist find them support them encourage people um into the health field I think we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve really 40 of people are looking for treatment outside of traditional medicine but the fact of the matter is sometimes that traditional medicine practitioners who you need go to your nurse practitioners a lot of people don&#x27;t want to see they&#x27;re they work harder than anybody else I know get the help you need and and stop putting Band-Aids on it and think it&#x27;ll just go away because it can kill you absolutely absolutely we got to take a quick pause when we come forward we&#x27;re going to continue our conversation as she continues to give us some insightful and very very important information on how we can reclaim our Wellness folks stay with us more conversations with her and of course with you Lana I see you would love to share your comment with our Watchers and so many more of you so but stay tuned we got a lot to talk about here on the culture on the Black Star Network foreign [Music] on the streets a horrific scene a white nationalists rally that descended into deadly violence white people are losing their deadlines as an angry pro-trump monster storms the U.S Capitol we&#x27;re about to see the rods what I call White minority resistance you have seen white folks in this country who simply cannot tolerate black folks voting I think what we&#x27;re seeing is the inevitable result of violent denial this is part of American History every time that people of color had made progress whether real or symbolic there has been but Harold Anderson at Emory University calls white rage as a backlash this is the wrath of The Proud boys and the Boogaloo boys America there&#x27;s going to be more of this guy this country is getting increasingly racist in its behaviors and its attitudes because of the fear of white people to see that they&#x27;re taking our job they&#x27;re taking our resources they&#x27;re taking our women this is Whitefield Papa [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Livestock Network a real uh Revolution there right now thank you for being the voice of Black Americans now we have to keep this going the video looks phenomenal see the difference between black star Network and black owned media and something like CNN you can&#x27;t beat black on media and be scared it&#x27;s time to be smart bring your eyeballs home you dig [Music] foreign [Music] all right folks welcome back to the show we have been talking to our sister Dr Bridget Williams ND for her News segment we claim your Wellness to another installment is happening at this point uh Dr Bridget uh want to bring you back into the frame as you talk to us about mental health and more importantly um how ERS have not been accommodating to to Black patients coming in through their doors to address this very very very very big issue in our community and you brought up the cases around suicide um then you also talked to us about the situation of the infant mortality rate among black women higher than any other group of women in this country and so we we when we&#x27;re talking about reclaiming our wealth and our Wellness um it really is a a multi-pronged approach it&#x27;s not just about what an individual chooses to do or not to do is also about what the hospital and the Health Care system of this country chooses to do and not to do it is also about what the community what we advocate for right what we what we say is oh is good and what&#x27;s not good and that comes that helps to to create the culture around these conversations you know um so many people are checking in my crew members are saying look we look at mental health uh for example Lana said I I never she said I know several black people who had committed suicide uh we have never taken our lives at rates like today we talked about twitch we talked about other black folks prominent black folks black folks who in all metrics have achieved some high level of success but still felt like they were unfulfilled still felt like taking their lives was the best option to to deal with whatever issues that they had and so I think the conversation has to be more than just this trendy space that we find this conversation in you know people say you know people we throw around different words mental health we throw around depression we throw around anxiety we we throw around self-care and it&#x27;s like no man this stuff is really affecting us though it&#x27;s really infected us now if we go really deep in to this point that you made about the infant mortality rate I think that part of the reason that I could be way wrong on this but I think that part of the reason that women are losing babies is because of the great amount of stress that is placed on black women in particular from everything from housing to money to family to to relationships and all of that that plays a huge role in a woman&#x27;s body when she&#x27;s carrying a child and and if she is not consuming the right information she&#x27;s not eating the right food if she&#x27;s not living in a very um life preserving environment she is not the the chances of the child going through this part of the the process it gets slim and slim and I mean the fact I&#x27;m seeing doc very quickly no and the fact of the matter is is no you&#x27;re you&#x27;re fine when you&#x27;re talking about poverty if you&#x27;re talking about stress right poverty itself is a factor into mental illness 31 of individuals living in poverty deal with depression um versus half of that 15.8 percent of people that are not living in poverty right and basically anytime you&#x27;re dealing with tremendous stress on your mental on your body it&#x27;s going to have an effect obviously on on on the hormones that are produced during your pregnancy and so not only is it affecting you affecting whether you&#x27;re able to carry this child but then those hormones have an effect on the child itself and so all of that can be taken into consideration we need what what I&#x27;m hoping with reclaim your Wellness is that we have conversations that change the narrative that shift the mindset of how we think about our health and how we approach the Health Community how we look at mental health this is something that we&#x27;re going to be talking about because way too often do we dismiss the crazy cousin um wait and everyone&#x27;s got that person I remember you know you know that I&#x27;m a cannabinoid specialist one of my best friends older cousin smoked all the time and I literally thought oh you know and she was a wild child she was a wild child and I thought oh it&#x27;s that cannabis it&#x27;s that weed that&#x27;s what makes her act like that scared everything out of me it wasn&#x27;t until going to medical school learning about cannabis one day I called my friend I was like I think your cousin had bipolar disorder and diagnosed into her 40s here was a teenage girl self-medicating all of her life until she got into her 40s and then realized that what she was doing was actually dealing with bipolar disorder this is what happens too often we have young people that are unsure of how they&#x27;re interpreting the world unsure about the feelings that they&#x27;re having and then they self-medicate with alcohol drugs cannabis whatever it may be when we need to let mental health be an open conversation in our black homes with our parents with our grandparents and not be ashamed of it but approach this so that we can do we have a vulnerability being black in America that we cover up we&#x27;re always talking about the strong black man the strong black one people are tired of being strong we need to put our resources into being helped and no better way of being helped is being helped by people that look like us a lot also said doc that you would be a great uh black chief of medicine for black people she thinks you&#x27;re really good about that give me give me come on so big shout out to Lana uh Karena checked in and said we didn&#x27;t pay uh we don&#x27;t pay enough attention to each other and social media has made it a thousand times worse we are confident in the depiction of a curated space to tell us how a person uh should feel absolutely um people need to seriously take social media breaks um if if use it at all the fact that it is so exciting I mean first of all just the smart spun itself we will realize over the years that the detriment that it has had on our young people and as uh as a cultural worldwide okay this constant ability to be contacted to be plugged in to see these perfect lives the way that they appear and it&#x27;s not the way it is okay all of it is well constructed and so but that leads people into stress anxiety feeling like they need to keep up we didn&#x27;t grow up in that situation necessarily people what people were doing was was in their own homes but now it is for everyone to see and people curate ideas that for some of us we take it in and it causes depression and less than anxiety and stress that we don&#x27;t need in this world turn it off get rid of it have your hour for it today you&#x27;re not missing anything if there&#x27;s other ways to and you can actually have a phone conversation right but you know I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about missing anything because I think most of us know if you&#x27;re on social media you know that nothing is really jumping off like that you know every 30 minutes I think it&#x27;s gotten just be part of our habit right you know I remember reading some statistics around this and they said that you know within a course of an hour we look at our phones over like three four hundred times absolutely a course of an hour so I think it&#x27;s more now it&#x27;s just so ingrained in our habit that we you know it&#x27;s like the first moment we can take to breathe we breathe in on social media it&#x27;s like ah I&#x27;ve taken a little break let me see what&#x27;s going on on Instagram and it&#x27;s like natural it&#x27;s like this habit now yeah but it&#x27;s we want rewiring our brains because now we&#x27;re using this very quick 30 second information it pulls down our ability to sit through an hour class how when when you&#x27;re used to the screen flipping every 30 seconds or less very quickly right so if you notice it happens so quickly that you have to watch it a couple times to get the full thing and understand it it is rewiring our brains children should have breaks and limited exposure adults need to have breaks and limited exposure because it&#x27;s not good for anybody okay absolutely so absolutely and so what what I suggest is do real person interaction whether it is getting in a real conversation there&#x27;s nothing wrong with face timing or what have you in this day and age um but to be willing to have real conversations and be vulnerable vulnerable enough to share how you actually are feeling and checking in on somebody else and have a pact that you can share how you are really feeling with me with no judgment I&#x27;m not going to just tell you it&#x27;s going to be okay I&#x27;m really going to hear you people need to have a safe Zone if you ask me you can um okay yes ma&#x27;am the fact of the matter is if you&#x27;re black in America you have PTSD you have some mild exaggerate heavy some level of severe to mild form of PTSD because it is hard to grow up in this culture in the U.S without having some sense of trauma around the fact of how the world experiences your Blackness I want to put you on pause right there and there&#x27;s no way in the world that I gotta let alone we gotta take a quick pause I can&#x27;t let you go okay I can&#x27;t let you go right now okay all right I can&#x27;t let you go because that is that that now you&#x27;re changing the game you&#x27;re changing the whole conversation yeah if we&#x27;re all suffering from some form of PTSD mild to Major then then we got to have in serious conversation folks we got to take a quick pause when we come back more with Dr Bridget as we&#x27;re talking about reclaiming your Wellness here on the culture stay with us it&#x27;s the culture and the Black Star Network [Music] pull up a chair take your seat the black tape with me Dr Greg Carr here on the Black Star Network every week we&#x27;ll take a deeper dive into the world we&#x27;re living in join the conversation only on the Black Star Network Blackstar network is here the real uh revolutionary right now thank you for being the voice of Black Americans going the video looks phenomenal see the difference between black star Network and black owned media and something like CNN you can&#x27;t beat black on media and be scared it&#x27;s time to be smart bring your eyeballs home you dig [Music] thank you [Music] all right folks welcome back to the culture here on the Black Star Network we&#x27;ve been talking about reclaiming your Wellness with Dr Bridget Williams MD and Dr Williams Dr Bridget just dropped the ball this wasn&#x27;t even on the agenda folks he just is this when you were on the agenda Dr Bridget you said that if you&#x27;re black in America that we all you didn&#x27;t say some you said we all suffer from PTSD from mild to major or severe and I do think that is and I I do say all because that&#x27;s my opinion if you look at research we black people have the highest prevalence of PTSD in America we are ptsc we&#x27;re 8.7 percent um where everyone else is falling below that and so I think that is I I say that a little tongue-in-cheek button just asking me in my medical appearance my medical uh opinion I don&#x27;t know how we cannot and so in simply growing up and and I don&#x27;t even have to go through the details that if you are experiencing American culture and you&#x27;re growing up black in American culture you&#x27;re going to have some experiences that can lead to whether mild to more severe PTSD um depending on your experiences right and we have similar experiences we don&#x27;t have all the same experiences but we do have some things obviously in common wow wow now here&#x27;s what here&#x27;s another point that my guy Willie Frazier brought up I don&#x27;t know if you saw this on social media I did I thought this was interesting I actually put it out on my Twitter Willy you brought this question up you said there was a moment this weekend when a black female therapist said she wasn&#x27;t going to treat black males because of questions uh the potential patients had uh about her um about her her experience she was getting and I saw this where this sister was saying look I&#x27;m no longer going to treat black men she said because black men have been scrutinizing her and and really uh questioning her experience and her ability to do her job before they decide that they want to you know get her Services as a therapist and she was pushing back on that so Willie asked this question um is this common and are males difficult did you see this on social media I did not um I I have a dozen questions around that because I think just in my own just in my you know my own medical practice and and you know over the years I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve had that experience across the board right and I do think if you&#x27;re in the healthcare field um It&#x27;s Not Easy Being a woman it&#x27;s not easy being a black woman in the healthcare field because we are definitely black women are are not the most cared for group and you know we we have a lot of Statistics that puts us at the bottom as far as being protected and cared for and seen as intelligent even though we probably have the highest um College in higher education numbers in this country and so I think quite often um we are asked how do you measure up and but I&#x27;ve had that happen with you know white women white men black men I mean they there&#x27;s a moment of trying to scrutinize you and for whatever reason she&#x27;s seeing this with one particular group um my thing is when you&#x27;re seeing abnormal behavior from a group either it&#x27;s a cultural aspect or there is a issue with that individual themselves meaning do they have some trauma that has led them to those questions so obviously I haven&#x27;t seen the report and there&#x27;s probably a lot more to this than what we are I gotta say this tweeter I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m not just saying I got to send you the Tweet of the therapist who made this because it was it&#x27;s fascinating and and I saw it and I was like okay this is very interesting but I do know that some black men and some men in general uh really do have a problem with getting any type of guidance and I and I also you know I question that because I&#x27;m thinking of like well what about your mother I&#x27;m like she&#x27;s your first therapist she&#x27;s your first you know health care worker so would you question your mother&#x27;s ability like I I question any man who who has a problem getting any type of guidance any type of Truth any type of anything from a woman because she&#x27;s based on a woman I&#x27;m like well what kind of relationship do you have with your mother it&#x27;s very interesting but I do recognize to your point that you made earlier about that uh we got PTSD and we got some serious entries between the Sexes right which creates barriers for us to build and to connect with one another in a healthy way and and of course that just permeates through building families building communities having a solid foundation for the next generation of children I mean it it creates a domino effect it does it does look we definitely struggle and I definitely think um black men in particular will struggle with being vulnerable and to be honest being with any sort of therapist whatsoever puts you in a place of great vulnerability and if that is something that you&#x27;re uncomfortable with if you have not been taught to um be comfortable in your own skin and with your emotions seeing a therapist can be an incredibly uncomfortable situation and if anything what I&#x27;m hearing from the little that I know from this tweet is that if someone is coming in and they&#x27;re not really comfortable with the idea of seeing a therapist in the first place you put on the defense mechanism and now I point the finger back at you to make you and so the I hate the fact that it&#x27;s pointing the finger at black men what we should be pointing the finger at is vulnerability a lack of uh being able to control your emotions in an appropriate way and this is not a particularly a black man problem I think the same thing could happen with black women or white one anyone that has trouble struggling with emotion and they&#x27;ve had issues or trauma I mean why are they seeing the therapist there&#x27;s probably some issues that got them there right right so if that was the way to and I cannot speak on her experience that would lead her to that coming to that conclusion but clearly instead of working through it in some way because in seeing this is someone that needs a lot more help let me work this through with them I don&#x27;t I understand sometimes you have to cut that line and create the boundary and it&#x27;s time to move on but there is a reason why someone behaves that way and I think as a community we need to be able to find a way to become comfortable with vulnerability we&#x27;re not allowed to be vulnerable in this country absolutely absolutely man oh man I&#x27;m so happy that we got this new segment with you Doc and I know some of our crew members have already expressed that they&#x27;re happy to have this type of connection with you so again we appreciate it we claim your Wellness with

back to the show uh before we roll out gotta talk about the Oscars just for a quick moment if you haven&#x27;t had a chance to watch the 95th Oscar presentation last night there were some big moments and of course there were some big snubs yes yes yes all right let me just say this first and foremost it seems to be a trend where now if you host an award show you can go on stage and just blast them for what they&#x27;re not doing this is what Jimmy Kimmel did last night as he hosted the the Oscars presentation just talking about everything from the slap of last year to talk about how now the Oscars has a crisis team in case there are moments of violence yeah and this is all coming from a white comedian so it will be interesting to see how that message who comes across to the media so Jimmy Kimmel definitely put the Oscars on blast last night uh another one of the big moments is one of our sisters sister Ruth Carter who is the phenomenal costume designer for black panther she has won her second Oscar yesterday for her work for black panther uh wakanda forever and she took home the big one yesterday and uh rightfully so if you saw black panther you know that Ruth Carter put in extra work there&#x27;s a fantastic documentary that she&#x27;s included in on Disney plus when she talks about how she decided to go once they decided to take this to the conversation to uh to Mexico and including that part of um you know including those people into the story how she had to do the research and how she Incorporated all of the here&#x27;s history to bring that characters the the costumes of those characters to life so it&#x27;s a phenomenally it&#x27;s a fascinating piece um around the making of black panther wakanda forever but big shout out to Sister Ruth Carter once again bringing home Oscar gold all right and the final piece I don&#x27;t know if it was a snob or not but everyone was expecting and even hoping that ah Queen Angela Bassett would take home her Oscar for her role as the queen ramonda and she did not and it was uh the best ass her role in everyone every everything everywhere all at once um and so you know people uh let me just say hey Kim Let&#x27;s go up the pictures do we got a picture of Angela Bassett when she was uh when Jamie Lee Curtis was uh was name was called we got a picture of video I just wanted to show people she was not happy folks take a look at this this is not the face of Happiness folks everyone else was clapping and cheering and Angela Bassett had to take that gut punch right there and this was what made the news today that she did not even clap for Jamie Lee Curtis then she had to take one on the chin for that snub even though people many people thought she was going to win it was this phase that has gotten people talking and not only did this happen that face but then Jonathan major saying Michael B Jordan of Creed 3 decided to take a few moments out of their presentation for the best cinematography to say this take a look hey auntie we love you I see we love you that&#x27;s a nod that was a little interesting nod on the whole situation here&#x27;s the thing very quickly folks as we wrap up today&#x27;s show um Angela Bassett phenomenal actress Jamie Lee Curtis never got her never gotten an Emmy Emmy I&#x27;m saying Oscar for all of the years of work she&#x27;s put in she&#x27;s another great actress they both uh Jamie Lee Curtis this will be her first Oscar at the age of 68. um it&#x27;s unfortunate it&#x27;s unfortunate I hope that people don&#x27;t make Jamie Lee Curtis feel bad about about everything uh just for her win because Angela Bassett didn&#x27;t win unfortunately in the Oscar in the awards world this is how it goes someone wins and someone loses and we only hope and praying and we know that Angela Bassett is going to continue to put out quality work Jamie Lee Curtis is going to continue to put out quality work and that is unfortunately the hit that we that you get when you are active when you put up your work to be uh scrutinized when you put up your work to be judged that if you won&#x27;t sometimes walk away with the big goal but I just hope and pray that we don&#x27;t make Jamie be Curtis or any active field less than because they won because we didn&#x27;t because we were expecting someone else at the end of the day it is Art it is subjective we still loved it and they both deserve the great work and the great accolades that they have and so you know I know it&#x27;s hard for Angela Bassett but since Angela trust and believe your work has been Oscar gold for so many years you don&#x27;t need a statue to verify to validate it just know that you got love from the culture for the great work that you do all right all right folks that&#x27;s going to do it for me I thank each and every one if you want to thank my Dynamic team King Keenan Joel my control room I want to thank all of my very special voices Jason Nickles Dr Jason Nichols and
