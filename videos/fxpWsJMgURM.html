            <p>does ac gravity exist if so what shows it does one clear instance that shows ac gravity exists is the bose-einstein condensate this would leave albert einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity intact when one speaks of ac gravity ning lee is one of the people that comes to mind but we&#x27;ll come back to her later two important things to know about the bose einstein condensate is the fermion condensate and the higgs boson the higgs boson is the part within an atom that tells the atom what the mass should be the fermion condensate is a collection of electrons or any type of fermion for that matter on the lowest energy state so the state closest to the atom&#x27;s nucleus and it&#x27;s usually more than one fermion at this state which doesn&#x27;t naturally occur a fermion condensate is directly connected to the bose einstein condensate which is an exotic state of matter it&#x27;s a large quantum particle which is a collection of particles acting as one large particle this occurs due to the expansion of the higgs boson&#x27;s field of influence with a reduction of gravity and the propagation of an electromagnetic field which is directly connected to the gravitational field of an atom this was observed by a handful of scientists too well known eugene pobledoff and dr ningli this shows that gravity and electromagnetic fields have a direct correlation ning lee who passed on in 2021 had a string of interesting occurrences after a rediscovery of ac gravity in 1991. she stated that rotating ions could create a gravital magnetic effect if they were spinning perpendicular to their spin axis this could be done only by trapping superconductor ions in a lattice structure this can result in the device being either repulsive or attractive in dr ningli&#x27;s last research paper it stated that the device had a 0.5 to 2.1 gravitational reduction the paper stated that there would be research into a rotating model and then there was nothing for an extended period of time this extended period of silence right after this groundbreaking discovery riled up a lot of curiosity in people everyone was wondering where did dr ningli go one such person who brought it to the attention of a lot of people was tim ventura he came to discover that she was working for the department of defense and she was well and in good health followed by more silence and then she emailed a colleague letting them know that she got an 11 kilowatt effect everyone brushed this off this statement as if it was meaningless she got a grant from the department of defense for half a million dollars when an individual works for the the government they cannot openly talk about their work if they do there will be problems one of the people who know about such problems would be edward snowden ask him how well is that going for him see ning lee said herself this information should be for the people she said an 11 kilowatt effect 11 kilowatts she had 2 percent at 100 watts and she emailed her colleague to tell her that she got an 11 kilowatt effect that should be a 20 decrease in gravity magnetic fields at 11 kilowatts i would be assuming that this was done with a non-rotating model now just imagine what the decrease in gravity magnetic reduction would be with a rotating model before dr ningli did her last research paper and disappeared the following questions were asked about her 1997 research magnetic vector field okay so unfortunately at what distance does the two percent of gravity fade out so you&#x27;re back to normal okay according to the latino for the papers all of the should conduct up the space even the second floor they can imagine so that&#x27;s the inertial frame is really very very high and about second floor they said they couldn&#x27;t imagine it and he&#x27;s experimental he took her out let anything running there are no disinfect they put a superconductor back to no energy solved she based her ac gravity experiments off of an experiment made by a scientist known as eugene pobledov who was discredited called a fringe scientist and never had his results seen when reproduced by others who did not follow the same methods he did to produce such results go check the information about his experiments either the people did not even complete the experiment fully or they just didn&#x27;t replicate the results correctly like why would you try to recreate a scientific experiment that have the steps written out for you which you&#x27;re supposed to do and not do it correctly it&#x27;s like building a car not putting an engine in it and then wondering why it doesn&#x27;t start like it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just backwards or you complete half the experiment would be the equivalent of getting in the car and not turning the key to start it and just say the car doesn&#x27;t work well that&#x27;s all i got to say about that anyways but not only was he pushed from the public sector into the private sector many other well-known and recognized scientists supported his work one person that seems to stick out whenever the words anti-gravity is searched on google is the inventor salvatore caesar paris this is the device he patent i&#x27;m pretty sure you can&#x27;t patent devices that don&#x27;t work or maybe the patent office just doesn&#x27;t know that it doesn&#x27;t work but there are research papers showing that it does work such as this paper right here along with the 1997 paper by dr ningli but hey [Applause] but that all said is ac gravity possible or is it fiction with a peer review paper in real time evidence you decide you know comment what you think do you think it&#x27;s true or false oh yeah my next video is going to be on quantum crafts and what properties they possess till then peace online experimental results that establish this theory when this theory accepted by the society that we can think of how to increase the effect to the anti-gravity to the commercial use yet my situation is still in the controversial i&#x27;m not you</p>
