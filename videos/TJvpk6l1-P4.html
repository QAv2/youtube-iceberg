            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music playing] THOMAS WINTERTON: They&#x27;re here. TRAVIS TAYLOR: Awesome. THOMAS WINTERTON: I&#x27;m excited for their equipment.</p>
<p>TRAVIS TAYLOR: After last week, when Chris Bartel, who worked security on the ranch for Robert Bigelow more than a decade ago, showed us where a cave entrance in the mesa had mysteriously been covered over, we invited a team of</p>
<p>drillers to the ranch to help figure out what the Bigelow team might have wanted to keep hidden. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: Aaron and his crew from Straight Shot Drilling, they&#x27;re going to do some horizontal drilling into the side of the mesa.</p>
<p>The way that this horizontal drill works is they&#x27;re actually going to go down under the road, under this canal, and then be able to maneuver up, and hopefully puncture up into the mesa and see if we find a void there.</p>
<p>How deep are you? 80 feet. You&#x27;re 80 feet out? DRILLER: Yeah. How many gallons of fluid are we into this now that hasn&#x27;t come back out? 500 out of this tank, 1,000 out of the last one, and 400 out of the first.</p>
<p>ERIK BARD: So we&#x27;re talking 2,000 gallons, around there? It could be punching through into that void. - Wow. - Whoa.</p>
<p>Look at this. That-- what&#x27;s going on there. OK. So there it is, again. [beeping] Again, we&#x27;re doing</p>
<p>something here that we&#x27;ve not done before out here, outdoors with this thing running-- Yep. ERIK BARD: --and so there&#x27;s a correlation. Always.</p>
<p>Yeah. I noticed that the spectrum analyzer is giving us, once again, this mysterious 1.6 gigahertz signal, like the one recently captured at Homestead Two.</p>
<p>Every time we&#x27;ve seen that signal, something really strange is happening. ERIK BARD: Hey, Bryant. If you guys are game, I&#x27;ve got some handheld instruments that you could take</p>
<p>out to the homesteads. Just wander about and see if you get any unusual readings out there. Yeah. It always seems like,</p>
<p>it&#x27;s almost like a bait and switch type of a thing. You focus your energies in one spot and then, all of a sudden, stuff happens in other areas. Right.</p>
<p>[music playing] Well, do you want to go head down to the Homestead, then? Yeah. OK. Let&#x27;s do it. ERIK BARD: I&#x27;ve decided</p>
<p>to send Tom and Dragon out to the homesteads and see if we pick up anything happening out there. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: I guess we&#x27;ll walk around with both the Geiger counter, and then you&#x27;ve got the TriField meter.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll see if anything strange pops up and keep in touch with them. - Yeah. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: And I&#x27;ve also got the lightning detector, and right</p>
<p>now, it&#x27;s not measuring anything above background. OK. Yeah. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: Let&#x27;s walk around the back, where we&#x27;ve seen some strange</p>
<p>stuff, and then I guess we could even poke around inside the building a little bit. TOM LEWIS: OK. [beeping] Now, what am I getting? What was all that? KANDUS LINDE: Oh.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a lot of noise. This doggone thing is broadcasting. This thing shouldn&#x27;t be broadcasting anything.</p>
<p>Why would a device that&#x27;s designed to receive be broadcasting? Hey, Bryant, Tom, you copy? Yeah, I got you. Go ahead, Erik. ERIK BARD: We&#x27;ve got an RF spectrum analyzer, which is a receiver, that</p>
<p>seems to be broadcasting instead of just receiving. That&#x27;s not good. Well, just have a listen at this. [static and beeping] BRYANT DRAGON</p>
<p>ARNOLD: Are you OK? No. I just-- I just blacked out. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: Like blacked out? Yeah. It was like all the</p>
<p>blood rushed out of my-- my brain. This is not OK. Here, help me up. [radio chatter] Dude, you&#x27;re shaking. Want to go?</p>
<p>- Yeah. Let&#x27;s go. OK. I can&#x27;t feel my hand. You like-- you</p>
<p>can&#x27;t feel your hand? I can&#x27;t feel my hand. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: That&#x27;s your left arm. TOM LEWIS: That&#x27;s my left arm. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD:</p>
<p>That&#x27;s scary, dude. I don&#x27;t-- here. Put your arm around me. I don&#x27;t want to [bleep] around with that.</p>
<p>Tom Lewis said that he had no feeling in his left arm. I knew it had to be something cardiac-related. BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD (OVER</p>
<p>RADIO): Hey, you guys. Tom is experiencing stuff. He blacked out, has pain in his arm. KANDUS LINDE: Are you serious? Oh.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s taken him straight to the emergency room. I think so. THOMAS WINTERTON: Bryant, Kandus is right behind you so you can be watching for her.</p>
<p>[monitor beeping] We&#x27;re here at the emergency room still. The doctor finally came with results and basically, couldn&#x27;t say what exactly happened to cause Tom to pass out or black out.</p>
<p>He said my heart is skipping beats every so often, and so he&#x27;s running lots of lab tests to see if he can figure out why. It&#x27;s very unsettling because of the sequence of events that led up to that radio call.</p>
<p>From what I was experiencing and the sounds that Erik was sharing with everyone, and the way that it starts to-- those things don&#x27;t seem coincidental, just like so many others. There&#x27;s once again more</p>
<p>questions than answers, but at least I&#x27;m alive. [chuckling] Yeah. It was scary, and that&#x27;s all over now. THOMAS WINTERTON: What</p>
<p>happened to Tom is serious. The ranch takes a toll on people, but we need to move forward, go back into the hole, and keep drilling. As we get deeper into the hill,</p>
<p>the mud finally starts flowing. It fills up this large hole that they dug with a backhoe to catch this stuff. It becomes necessary to vacuum it out.</p>
<p>DRILLER: Hey, Thomas. Yeah. My back&#x27;s full. I need to go dump it. Oh, OK.</p>
<p>All right. THOMAS WINTERTON: You think that&#x27;ll catch it? DRILLER: Yeah THOMAS WINTERTON: We put a screen underneath of it when we dumped it, just to see if we could catch anything that might</p>
<p>be coming out of that hole. DRILLER: Check. THOMAS WINTERTON: What is that? Hey. Look at that. ERIK BARD: Thomas,</p>
<p>what are you seeing? Looks like you&#x27;re studying some-- THOMAS WINTERTON: I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s rock or if it&#x27;s like rust or What is that? Oh, my. THOMAS WINTERTON: Is it just rock? It&#x27;s brittle.</p>
<p>ERIK BARD: This is really thin. What did you think it was when you first saw it? THOMAS WINTERTON: Well, I wondered if it was, like, metal flakes or something. ERIK BARD: That&#x27;s exactly</p>
<p>the same impression I got. I&#x27;m surprised to see that there are pieces of material-- not rock, possibly metal-- being screened out of that 800 gallon volume of slurry with bentonite clay. I don&#x27;t know what</p>
<p>this material is. At first, it appears to be like rust or some kind of sheet metal that has been broken into pieces. So this is that really-- that&#x27;s that really large one.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the biggest one we found, right? ERIK BARD: Yeah, yeah. All right. I want to rinse it off back here away from the electronics.</p>
<p>MALE: OK. ERIK BARD: Let&#x27;s get the other side. All right. Well, look at that.</p>
<p>MALE: Does it have any-- ERIK BARD: Yeah. Look at this surface here. It&#x27;s all bumpy. It&#x27;s kind of a brownish color.</p>
<p>And this has got streaks of that brown in it, but there&#x27;s a black color here on this much flatter, smoother surface. Well, let&#x27;s find out what it is.</p>
<p>Does it have to be dry to analyze it? ERIK BARD: Yeah. I&#x27;d prefer to let the thing dry off. OK.</p>
<p>ERIK BARD: In order to identify what that material is, at least to get a sense of its composition, I&#x27;ve decided to use the handheld X-ray fluorescence analyzer, or XRF instrument, and see what elements show up.</p>
<p>I like to describe the XRF device is basically a fancy X-ray flashlight. We shine those X-rays at objects and we look at what X-ray colors come back to identify the materials of which they&#x27;re made.</p>
<p>So this is telling me, on this first reading on this side, we&#x27;re looking at calcium, iron, silicon, aluminum, magnesium. - Wait, iron? - Yeah.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s-- And aluminum? Yeah. It&#x27;s like 8% aluminum on that shot. How much iron is it? That time, it was 26%. So this is definitely</p>
<p>metallic, then. Oh, yeah. Let&#x27;s take a look at this other side. Guys.</p>
<p>THOMAS WINTERTON: That number is much different. Yeah. This side of this thing is showing up-- it&#x27;s almost 72% iron.</p>
<p>This thing is just straight up metal. This sample is almost solid metal. Wow.</p>
<p>What is metal doing coming out of the hill 300 feet in? BRYANT DRAGON ARNOLD: As the experiments get bigger and better, they also get more dangerous and more hazardous. What are we going to trigger</p>
<p>with these bigger experiments? THOMAS WINTERTON: Metal flakes or something. TRAVIS TAYLOR: I don&#x27;t know how this material got inside the mesa. Could it be from an asteroid</p>
<p>impact or an alien spacecraft or an underground base? Who knows? But what we do know is whatever this is, it&#x27;s made up of rare and unusual elements. We need to find out what it&#x27;s doing here on Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
