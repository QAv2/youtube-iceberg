            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel this channel is educational in nature and uh I try to turn people on to uh new and exciting theories of everything and all-encompassing theories and obscure and esoteric um Paradigm shifters uh things that I&#x27;ve stumbled across in my research over the last many years and uh that I&#x27;d like to share with you as um to hope that they will help you in ways that they&#x27;ve helped me so on and so forth uh today is our 338th video that we have done on dwey B Larson&#x27;s reciprocal system of theory and uh Mr Larson was a engineer chemical IAL and Mining engineer maybe and uh he lived I was born in North Dakota back in 1898 moved out to Portland he fought in World War I moved out to Portland and went to school out at Oregon State uh oh in Corvalis and then moved to Portland and uh had his career out there and it was working on a chemistry problem trying to make a contribution to the industry uh but he uh stumbled across something that was much more um you know uh much bigger than what he was actually looking for he was just trying to make you know marginal discoveries and he ended up kind of stumbling upon this huge discovery that required him to uh put in a crap ton of work to um you know work it out but he answered the call and he he he you know he was kind of maybe be thinking I&#x27;m in over my head here uh do I want to really dedicate my whole life to this uh and that&#x27;s what he did he dedicated UH 60 years the rest of of his life until he died in 1990 to um you know working out and then refining his reciprocal system of theory uh he eventually came out with his uh two fundamental postulates in the 19 late 19 1950s and from there he worked out his a theoretical universe and from there he he kind of compared his Universe his theoretical Universe with the actual universe that the the um Legacy scientists had come up with and in general uh his findings compared very favorably with the already found findings of the um Main stream but he made a significant Corrections in a number of different areas especially in the so-called relativistic areas of the very fast the very small and the very large and in the same way that Einstein uh came and corrected a lot of the Newtonian mechanics the Newtonian mechanics is generally correct for for you know the majority of cases but in the cases of the very small the very fast and the very large um some adjustments were end were made by Einstein Larson kind of makes those same or similar adjustments and in some cases the math is the same but in larsson&#x27;s case he clears up the concepts he he not only can give you the different equations but he gives you the why and wherefore of these equations why are we doing this uh many times Einstein didn&#x27;t uh provide that or if he did he provided it incorrectly and some of his followers didn&#x27;t even think that there were any concepts involved uh such as verer Heisenberg okay now uh the basic idea and the reciprocal system of theory is that the universe is made entirely of motion and for Larson uh motion was the relationship between space and time uh space and time uh are thereby reciprocals of one another motion is basically a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator space and time have no independent significance they only exist together in motion and they&#x27;re reciprocally related in motion um now it wasn&#x27;t really just any kind of motion what we&#x27;re talking about is what Larson calls a scalar motion which is a motion that hasn&#x27;t really been uh has been discovered but hasn&#x27;t been really investigated in detail uh to to uh flesh out um all the properties uh scalar motion is a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction um you can Envision a scalar motion by taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on it and then blowing up the balloon all of the dots will be moving away from each other but in no specific Direction uh each dot will be moving away from each other dot um and uh you won&#x27;t really get a direction or what you call a vectorial motion or a normal kind of motion out of that until you pick one dot and you decide that this dot is my reference point meaning that this dot is I&#x27;m going to pretend that this dot is motionless and then you will be able to kind of measure the direction that each dot is moving away from that particular dot but in reality the dot that you&#x27;ve picked is also moving and so when you do assign a reference point you&#x27;re kind of moving away from uh from RE the reality which is that the motion is scalar and it doesn&#x27;t have any specific Direction uh everything is moving away from every other thing even whether whether it occupies a DOT or not so um that is what Larson calls a scaler motion he refers to that as clock time and clock space so clocks clock time we we understand the clock time is always getting later and later and later and later but in no specific Direction so that is uh scalar Motion in time scalar motion is in space uh is that um everything is always getting farther and farther and farther apart and uh you can use that balloon uh with the dots on it to model that but that has also been observed by the Hubble telescope and seeing that all of uh the distant galaxies are moving away from one another and as long as we don&#x27;t want to cling to the idea that our galaxy is at the center of the universe then we would also assume that our galaxy is participating in that same um motion away from all other galaxies all galaxies are moving away from all other galaxies except possibly the ones that are so close together that that motion that outward motion gets canceled out by some kind of gravitational motion the farther away they are the faster they are moving moving away from each other um and so that is what Larson refers to as clock uh clock space clock space and clock time then there&#x27;s also coordinate space and coordinate time we generally recognize uh coordinate space three dimensions of space XYZ coordinates but also there is such a thing as coordinate time um most people recog in time to be just onedimensional always flowing uh getting later and later and later but under C some circumstances time can take the form of three-dimensionality as well and then time and space Also only come in discrete units there is one um you have to have one full unit of space to have any space and you have to have one full unit of time to have any time and um if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light and so for Larson the speed of light is what he calls unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 and this unit speed is really like the background or the null point or the reference point or the zero point um of this Universe of motion which makes sense if you have a universe of motion that means that motion comes before everything else so this motion outward at the speed of light Larsson refers to it as the progression of the natural reference system this is what always is always in existence and so he makes his measurements from the speed of light outward in all directions you&#x27;re either going faster or slower so that that means that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light lson refers to this as the cosmic sector and this sector of the universe is generally unknown to a legacy scientists the part that they know about is called the material sector that&#x27;s the half that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light and that is where all the scientists make their observations and measurements and um the good news is that because of the reciprocal relationships involved um what is going on in the material sector is also going on in the cosmic sector with the caveat that all you have to do is ex uh interchange the roles of space and time so in the material sector you&#x27;ve got coordinate space and clock time time is always getting later and later later but if you cross that unit speed boundary and you move into the cosmic sector into the faster than the speed of light realm then you have coordinate time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart you have three dimensions of time so that&#x27;s kind of how it works and Larson took that postulate and the second po which just really has to do with math and geometry um of the universe and he worked out his theoretical universe and then he wrote many books based on his findings uh books on chemistry and astronomy and physics but also on economics metaphysics including philosophy psychology religion um biology even things like dream interpretation psychic phenomena and uh we&#x27;ve gone over many of those things in the previous videos today we are looking at um the last installment of larsson&#x27;s paper is called the mechanism of the universe this paper is primarily on cosmology talks about uh kind of the macro grow universe that we live in uh the big you know goes over some of the uh Legacy Theory theories of a uh cosmology such as the big bang and the steady state Theory and the oscillating Theory and uh he reviews those basic ideas of the Legacy scientists and then he also inserts his own ideas about what his cosmology is what what you know does his the does the reciprocal system agree with these other philosophies or cosmologies or does it disagree and how and why and what are the concepts involved uh and he&#x27;s gone over a number of different uh uh points of view on this matter so if you want to start fresh you want to go back about six videos and start uh at the beginning to go through Larson&#x27;s whole thought process so he&#x27;s just kind of summing up summing it up right here and um uh here we go the region under the gravitational control of a star uh he was talking about globular clusters here globular clusters are like Proto galaxies they&#x27;re not not quite big enough to be galaxies but they are uh spherically shaped groups of stars that are in the process of formation and then when you combine several of the globular clusters you end up start getting like dwarf galaxies and then more globular clusters come into the picture and you get bigger and bigger galaxies the region under the gravitational control of a star within the cluster meets the region under the control of its neighbor at a point where the gravitational force of each star is near the minimum each star is therefore outside the gravitational limit of its neighbor and because its net balance of motions is outward it can never get inside this limit the defuse aggregate from which the globular cluster was formed contacts its neighbor at a point of Maximum gravitational force and the gravitational limits of neighboring Aggregates therefore overlap the increase of mass due to the incoming Cosmic matter extends the limits still farther and by the time the globular cluster stage is reached each cluster is well within the gravitational limits of one or more of its neighbors the Clusters therefore move toward each other and eventually some of them make contact the prevailing opinion is that because of the immense distances between the Stars the Stellar Aggregates participating in such an encounter would pass through each other with no significant interaction our findings indicate that this view is incorrect in as much as the stars of the cluster occupy equilibrium positions the aggregate has the general characteristics of a liquid and the actual results of contact is an amalgamation of the Clusters the resulting combination with a population of two or three million stars is classified as a dwarf Galaxy its larger mass as compared to that of the original cluster greatly increases its gravitational force and improves its ability to capture additional clusters if it keeps out of the clutches of still larger galaxies the small Galaxy ultimately becomes a large Galaxy this picture of the situation is in direct conflict with much of current astronomical thought although no consensus has been reached on the issue as to how and under what circumstances condensation from the original diffus matter occurred conventional Theory regards the galaxies rather than the globular clusters as the original products of the condensation process and Views the globular clusters as very old features of the galaxies according to our findings by deduction from the fundamental physical Theory the stars of the globular clusters instead of being the oldest of those that are optically visible to us as conventional Theory asserts are the youngest of the observable stars in view of this direct conflict it would be of interest to review the available evidence to see just how well each of these conflicting theories agrees with the information from observation unfortunately the remaining space will not permit a detailed review of this kind but I can say that I made a critical comparison of the two conflicting explanations of the status of the globular clusters a few years ago in which I examined the assertions of each Theory with respect to 15 sets of facts which can be considered to represent practically all that is now known about the Clusters in this investigation I found that conventional Theory furnishes fully acceptable explanations for three of these 15 items partially satisfactory explanations for three more unsatisfactory explanations for three items no explanation at all for four items and is definit in conflict with the facts in two cases the deductions from the postulates of the reciprocal system on the other hand furnish full and detailed explanations for everyone of these 15 items while as I said space does not permit a full discussion of these results I am rather reluctant to make statements such as the foregoing with without at least some substantiation and I will therefore comment briefly on two of the items to give an idea of the basis for my conclusions first let us consider the Motions of the Clusters in the words of stru they move quote much as freely falling bodies attracted by the galactic center our Theory says that this is is exactly what they are and how they should move conventional theory is able to explain such motions only on the basis of some highly implausible assumptions as an illustration of another type of pertinent information observations of the star clusters within the galactic disk show that these groups are not stable and are disintegrating at a relatively rapid rate the large number of such clusters now in existence in spite of the short indicated life means that some process of replenishment must be operative our theoretical development tells us that the supply is replenished by globular clusters which fall into the Galaxy and break up the astronomers have no explanation at all Bach for example says we quote we do not pretend to know from where the galactic clusters come he admits that it would be tempting to regard the globular clusters as the source of The Replacements but this would challenge the physicist&#x27;s conclusions as to the source of Stellar energy and of course that is Unthinkable there is no no limitation on the process of capture from the environment which continually increases the size of a Galaxy so far as the capture process itself is concerned the growth could continue indefinitely however the existence of an age limit also limits the galactic size when this limit is reached the material phase of the great cycle of the universe of motion terminates all right that is the end of Larson&#x27;s paper the mechanism of the universe and um so if you want to uh go back to the beginning go back six episodes there are seven EP uh seven episodes of that paper now tomorrow we we will be uh going into a new paper a new writing a new something um that related to the reciprocal system still but um I think we&#x27;re going to try to uh learn a little bit more about what is called rs2 rs2 is the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system so a few of larsson&#x27;s followers in particular Dr Bruce paret and Dr kvk um uh worked out some of the Kinks in Larson&#x27;s Theory Larson admitted that his theory was subject to error that the theory itself was correct but whether it was applied correctly in all cases was another matter and that he may have made some mistakes in and how he applied the theory and that those mistakes would become clear over time time um because they would uh you know they would Clash with the rest of the theory they would conflict with things and so uh pret and nuu even though they are uh very uh much followers of lson they&#x27;re not trying to you know dissent or to disagree with larsson&#x27;s Theory but they just felt like certain aspects of it needed uh some correction and so they derived this thing called rs2 the reciprocal system to the re-evaluation of the reciprocal system we&#x27;re going to look we&#x27;re going to take a look at um some writings that have to do with their work uh in particular Dr Bruce pet in this uh in this instance we&#x27;re going to look at a few of his articles that kind of try to explicate rs2 um which is exciting and actually I consider uh I consider consider larsson&#x27;s contributions in terms of the reciprocal system to be absolutely um uh what&#x27;s the word um just uh magnificent and gargantuan um but I also consider the uh improvements that have been made by doctors pet and nuou to be accomplishments almost on that same level just like hug huge amounts of work was put into this and huge advances that were made and it it really shapes out the reciprocal system to be something that can be reckoned with in the 21st and 22nd centuries that um and you know I am convinced that uh before it&#x27;s all said and done uh the reciprocal system will be used as the um you know educational standard in all Fields this is what we&#x27;re going to use to do uh as the fundamental basis for every subject um it might take 100 or 200 years to get there um because um you know overthrowing the previous paradigms can be a very time time consuming process because sometimes you have to wait till all the progenitors of those theories actually die off before you can encounter anybody with an open enough mind to um you know to accept the new theories but I find that uh the rs2 theory is just incredibly compelling um and uh so we&#x27;re going to learn about how you know kind of the process that Dr pet took to get from the reciprocal system over to rs2 and drive rs2 all right now uh thanks for tuning in and um you know come back tomorrow and we will learn a little bit about rs2 and uh have a beautiful day</p>
