            <p>hi everyone it&#x27;s good to be back I wanted to talk a little bit today about the antigravity theme coming out of the hunt for zero-point a few stories that came after the book was published which I thought one or two people might be interested in we&#x27;re going to talk about superconductors and anti-gravity experiments conducted by someone called Eugene pod clip knov a Russian and Ning Lee chinese-american I had the good fortune to meet them both and I&#x27;m gonna tell the stories of what happened to both of them because they&#x27;re actually very interesting and curious in 1996 the Daily Telegraph in London published a story about you jean-claude Clinton of POD Clinton oov was working at the University of tampere in Finland and he claimed he had managed to negate the force of gravity by 3% three to five percent actually doesn&#x27;t sound much but actually it&#x27;s tremendous amount when you consider that the force of gravity according to physics shouldn&#x27;t be negated by anything but he said that he&#x27;d negated the force of gravity by using superconductors superconductors are materials that lose all resistance to electricity at low temperatures there are some high-temperature superconductors as well and what spod clinton or found he claimed by accident was that he placed an object in a beam above the superconductor which sort of rotates like her if you imagine it like a vinyl disc if you place a an object in that beam above the above above it what happens is is that object loses weight five three to five percent again science says that&#x27;s impossible anyway he went forward NASA became interested NASA set up a concepts office to look at this and they were going to go ahead and test it Q to somebody called Ning Li Ning Li as I said Chinese Americans she was working at the University of Huntsville in Alabama and she also claimed that she had developed a similar system using superconductor that negates the force of gravity so NASA is gonna step in actually Ning Li get does get some US government money to go test this and then some rather strange things start to happen now in the hunt for zero point I talked about my meeting with Claude Clayton off he not only claimed when I met him that he had negated the force of gravity but that he had developed something called an impulse gravity generator which was like a kind of force field of being that he could shoot out into space and which would be capable when weaponized of knocking down satellites and the beauty of this as a weapon was that the person or the object struck by this by this weapon system would never actually know what had hit them so it was the ultimate kind of stealthy weapon system now you&#x27;d think that someone who developed something like this and he claimed that these experiments have been going on inside Russia would have got no end of people beating a path to their door to sign them up get the money get this stuff developed and I&#x27;m gonna come back in a second to what happened when Boeing tried to beat a path to pod clad knobs door but let&#x27;s just go back to what happened with Ning Lee so Ning Lee make some progress in America under NASA supervision shortly after the publication of the hunt for zero-point XI which was in the American version was in 2002 Ning Lee disappears off the face of the earth in fact as far as I&#x27;m aware right now no one knows where she is the speculation is is that she succeeded in developing this anti-gravity system and she was either spirited into the American black world and somewhere maybe out in the desert someplace has developed a propulsion beam or a weapon system for the US Air Force or some branch at the US military or she went back to her her name of China simple people have tried to get in touch with her since 2003 which is around about the timeframe she disappeared and they have failed to do so as far as I&#x27;m aware I had the good fortune to meet Ning Li after the publication of to up the hunt for a point in 2003 at a conference in Washington DC called the high-frequency gravity wave conference and she was an utterly charming woman who was totally dedicated to producing gravity free energy for all she didn&#x27;t want it weaponized she didn&#x27;t want it thought by governments who had then suborn the technology for their own purposes she wanted to give it as a gift to the people people of the world so where did she go now I&#x27;m going to cut to the Boeing story in 2002 in 2002 and around the time of the publication of the US edition of the Harper&#x27;s ear point I came into possession of a set of documents they were literally posted through my office door anonymously in a brown envelope and when I opened it up it was a internal briefing memorandum from Boeing and it was called grasp and grasp stood for gravity reduction for advanced space propulsion and basically what this memo was saying was that Boeing was going to spend about a hundred thousand dollars of internal money testing the eugene pod clayton of anti-gravity device we published this in Jane&#x27;s Defence weekly there was a huge hoo-ha Boeing denied the story said that it wasn&#x27;t working on an antigravity or anything like it but of course I had the documents which said that they were looking at doing this so it was a little bit disingenuous because they were looking to do this experiment and they were going to spend money on it and I even had the name of the program manager who was a guy called Jamie Childress who was going to be in charge of this cut to a year later when I was at an event at which I met Jamie children and he advanced towards me looking slightly pissed off saying you&#x27;re the guy who got me my program cut well cut a long story short we had a drink or two everything was fine he calmed down and said look it wasn&#x27;t your fault but when that story came out in Jane&#x27;s Defence weekly all the funding that had been allocated to this experiment and all the who are surrounding it meant that it was never ever gonna get covered so we sort of shook hands and and went on our way so that really is kind of the story of these mysterious superconductors and what happened after the hunt for zero-point the two leading players as I say pod CLEP northern English I talk to them I have no doubt in my mind that Ning Lee was a very serious player and her disappearance remains mysterious and if anyone knows where she is in fact if Ning Lee happens to see this I would love to hear from her again she signed actually a theoretical paper that she had written on her work on the whole use of superconducting magnets and how to negate gravity and it was a really beautiful inscription that she put on the bottom of it which was I want to make this device work for all mankind and I hope that wherever she is she&#x27;s achieved that and to hear from her but as I say if anyone knows where she is I&#x27;d be delighted to hear from you too that&#x27;s all till the next time thanks again for listening and take care</p>
