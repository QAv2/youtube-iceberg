            <p>[Music] what&#x27;s up Jesse Michaels what&#x27;s up Danny Jones like I just said to you bro you&#x27;re gonna have to pull me back into the believer make me a Believer again because the more sh I learn about UFOs the more I am just out on this topic lately that&#x27;s understandable and I&#x27;m not here to bring you back I&#x27;m not an evangelist um I do think damn it I&#x27;m sorry I do think if the question is is the topic worthy of further investigation and is there something very interesting at the bottom of all of this you know you get to the final room is there something interesting going on my answer would be I I think I think yes um but yeah not I don&#x27;t want to Evangel I think in many ways interest in UFOs is maladaptive and a distraction for a lot of people and doesn&#x27;t make sense yes yes there&#x27;s a lot of sh you got to cut through bro like not just the if you want to talk about like scop stuff like sure there&#x27;s a lot of stuff you got to cut through with that but then there&#x27;s a whole another layer of of people monetizing this there&#x27;s a business right y like there we&#x27;re doing a podcast in a spaceship about UFOs because my audience loves UFOs and I&#x27;m going to make money talking about UFOs half the books on that on that shelf are about UFOs so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a huge business too yep which muddies the water even more yeah it it totally muddies the water and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a weird dynamic and I I think when you have a topic that&#x27;s kind of pointing at the sacred you know it&#x27;s it might be the tip of the iceberg it&#x27;s not the rest of the iceberg like it&#x27;s just an unidentified flying object is not necessarily what you&#x27;re going for I think a lot of people that are into it are like ultimately meaning Seekers and they want like a kind of a they want to understand the reality of religion they want to understand metaphysics and so I think uh UFOs are just a foray they&#x27;re just one kind of route in but I think combining that with money is a very weird thing I mean then it&#x27;s like sort of the modern modern Catholic indulgences or something it doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t really work right yeah totally man and we so we were just talking before we uh started rolling about that movie The Adjustment Bureau and there&#x27;s some crazy people some deep dark secretive people in this whole UFO world that aren&#x27;t public that um I guess we can talk about the guy right like he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s fully the reason I&#x27;m scared to talk about this guy yeah is because my podcast with Chris bledo yeah completely got nuked off YouTube yeah should we tell this story because you told me some really interesting stuff on a phone call I did yeah what did I tell you well you said that you say I don&#x27;t care okay Co cool um you said that uh the views were like you know was like doing 50k a day oh and then it cuts off you speak to some rep at Google and they&#x27;re like we don&#x27;t know what the hell happened here it doesn&#x27;t make any sense giv the clickthrough rate average V duration which should basically Define the video&#x27;s performance he goes the one other time I&#x27;ve seen this is with Jesse&#x27;s David grush video exactly performance fell off a cliff yep so and he said that he said that my video with bledo and your video with grush neither of them broke any YouTube rules or had any internal red flags that he was able to see yep and he goes whenever this happens which has happened one other time recently with David grush yep it&#x27;s basically the floor above me that I have no access to yep some something above my head that I don&#x27;t know what the hell&#x27;s going on so what the hell is going on why are they why are they doing this erasing podcasts with people who talk about getting abducted by aliens off of the internet I feel like they have way bigger fish to fry you would think I I I don&#x27;t know um there&#x27;s something very interesting about Chris bledo story it&#x27;s like why is you know Jim semivan very high up at the CIA why is he showing up at Chris bled so&#x27;s you know place in fville North Carolina uh when when he&#x27;s you know starts to kind of attract UFOs he talks to the lady or whatever you know the whole story uh he&#x27;s definitely attracted the attention of some very interesting people you know we were just talking about you know Tim Taylor that&#x27;s the guy I would always mention pseudonymously was WR written about in this great Book By Di Pula religious studies Professor called American Cosmic and then he was kind of doxed by Chris bledo on your show actually right which I think I thought that that might have been the reason that that video got completely blasted off the face of YouTube because of him talking about him right because if I&#x27;m that guy and I have all these connections that he allegedly has yeah I could probably make a call or send an email to somebody YouTube being like Nuke this thing totally yeah well that&#x27;s what and bledo even says in the story story that Tim Taylor gives him a whole brief about UFOs and then uh he says you can&#x27;t send this to anybody and then he like sends the email or something to his wife or like I don&#x27;t somebody very close and immediately gets a call from Tim being like knowing that he forwarded it yeah like you up yeah and so you know who knows if that&#x27;s like a test and like you know they&#x27;re sort of being scoped or you know I don&#x27;t I think even bledo thinks that you know maybe he was being messed with initially when he sort of entered his life um and even when he was I think he was G him a tour of like Kennedy Space Center he said he said when you walk through the security when you walk past the security Tower he goes just play a song in your head yeah so they can&#x27;t access your thoughts so they can&#x27;t access your thoughts right yeah and I asked him like what I&#x27;m like who&#x27;s in there yeah and he he was very he didn&#x27;t know he&#x27;s like mind readers I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re aliens or humans but they they read your minds and then he also said some sh that I&#x27;m like I don&#x27;t even know if I want to say on camera but he like say it d he told me some stuff okay essentially I&#x27;ll make it I&#x27;ll dumb it down so it&#x27;s not too technical but he basically told me that this fella showed him a real life Men In Black neuralyzer no way that wipes your memory no way this is what he told me how can you know neural we actually cut the segment out of the podcast cuz I was like there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m putting this on the podcast it was like a five it was like a 10-minute chunk of that bledo podcast where he explains everything about it how it works where they got it from no way yeah bro why didn&#x27;t they neuralize him after they described the whole neural that would seem like you would think they would want to do that right yeah but like that is like essentially is like one of the explanation for the missing time stuff and he had another story about like missing time where they were like walking through a forest yep I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re familiar with that one but like they were walking him and Tim were walking through a forest with somebody like looking for something and then all of a sudden like they started wow like they almost like started back to where they were an hour ago with like like in in an instant like almost it was like a loop like they looped through time or something it&#x27;s fascinating I don&#x27;t know well I just you know we were talking earlier about I did a piece on this guy Thomas Townsen Brown who I think is just a fascinating character one of the best documentaries I&#x27;ve ever seen thank you man it was incredible appreciate that um yeah well he&#x27;s he&#x27;s amazing he&#x27;s a I think like a forgotten hero in American history I think he made all sorts of breakthroughs and in the world of gravity but in general relativity gravity and time are related so the kind of subplot of his whole biography it&#x27;s a great biography called the man who mastered Gravity by a guy named Paul shatkin recommend you all read it um the subplot is that he&#x27;s obsessed with time travel and he talks about time travel constantly with his wife Josephine his daughter Linda and here&#x27;s where it gets really weird uh apparently Tim Taylor told Chris bledo that he was part of a secret time Travel Group in Nassau in the Bahamas and the president of that group was Thomas Townsen Brown now I would think that was totally I would dismiss that out of hand I would be like that&#x27;s you know that&#x27;s sort of you know Madness but I know from my own research independent research on Thomas towns of brown he spent a ton of time in Nassau in the Bahamas and he was just extremely interested in time travel and it was he was spending a lot of time with this guy William Stevenson who was James Bond&#x27;s super spy or sorry he was the inspiration for James Bond he was Winston Churchill&#x27;s super spy um but he was you know Ian Fleming&#x27;s inspiration for James Bond he&#x27;s just like fascinating kind of he&#x27;s you know coordinating a lot with Wild Bill Donovan early OSS U or late OSS you know early CIA involved in the formation of a CIA um was working out of the Rockefeller uh Center in New York and kind of calling a lot of interesting shots as you know almost part of like a a a shadow government if you will so he&#x27;s close with Thomas towns and brown they&#x27;re in the Bahamas a lot and then you you have you know Ryan bledo saying that Tim Taylor told his father that he&#x27;s part of the secret time Travel Group with Thomas Townson Brown just very very interesting and then and then you you know we were talking about this before the show you said uh you know that Tim Taylor told Chris bledo that The Adjustment Bureau was like you know yes his life or whatever and that&#x27;s all about like changing one little variable like it&#x27;s like if I were to freeze this room and like I don&#x27;t know move your mic like a little bit and you get this butterf butter fly effect style multiplicative effect down the line or whatever of like CH you know changing timelines it&#x27;s Madness it sounds kind of crazy completeing Madness science fiction it is it&#x27;s sci-fi and I&#x27;m not proposing that that&#x27;s you know a real thing but it&#x27;s it is fascinating that there are some connections there and then the final thing the final connection I made is towns and Brown&#x27;s daughter uh is a an amazing woman uh she was in the documentary right she was in the documentary on the phone call and her name&#x27;s Linda Brown but it was Linda Le uh for a while and she has an Amazon review on Tim Taylor&#x27;s biography Tim Taylor&#x27;s biography is called launch fever and I think he wrote 2003 2004 right and in 20 12 or 13 or 14 like early well before Diana Pula even pseudonymously published about Tim Taylor under the pseudonym Tyler in American Cosmic in 2018 Linda leech is writing a review on launch fever saying this is you know Wonderful homage to you know the the space program or whatever so clearly there&#x27;s a connection between towns and brown and Tim Taylor which is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s pretty interesting yeah dude yeah so you have this mid-century inventor who I I think I mean at the very Le like we have an FBI file on Thomas Townson Brown saying he was the the lead radar scientist in the entire Navy like this guy&#x27;s a real guy you can say he didn&#x27;t crack anti-gravity that&#x27;s f I&#x27;m like totally open to that like you have to think probabilistically around that I have a lot ofing evidence that he did you can but say he didn&#x27;t do that or whatever he&#x27;s like a very real guy and he&#x27;s talking about time travel constantly and then there&#x27;s this really interesting connection with a modern NASA Mission controller I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t understand it yeah going to the like The Adjustment Bureau comment that he [Music] made do you think that there&#x27;s a thing that happens to people and I wouldn&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t have this the personal experience but do you think it&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s something that happens to somebody or or certain individuals when they have tons of super super top secret information that they have and nobody else has where they sort of feel like their life is for lack of a better term they&#x27;re living The Da Vinci Code and they sort of like fall into to that and they sort of like look through their entire life at that through that lens right like like I am living I am living this movie or like I am the superhero character because I hold these secrets that like literally would change the power Bal balance of the world if I let them out yeah I wonder what that does to your brain you know what I mean I want I do wonder that as well and then I wonder how much of it is like human clearance systems versus like have you ever experienced synchron ities in your life popping up showing up like really really cool interesting fun way so maybe there are people that are more tapped into that in a in sort of a weird way you know well that&#x27;s what this guy tries to do right he&#x27;s trying to tap into this this other thing he&#x27;s trying to get these downloads that she&#x27;s in her new book she talks about like all these Diana Pula in her new I forget the name of her new book she T in that one she talks about encounters yeah yeah it&#x27;s great awesome book um shout out to Dian um all these protocols that he goes through every day by not drinking coffee and like going outside getting sunlight and all this stuff in the morning and like trying to download some sort of cosmic [ __ ] so we can make more patents yeah it it sounds so woooo and wild and like I you know I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what to say about it um I think that&#x27;s more how thinking Works than the average person realiz it you know I&#x27;m a big fan of the transmission theory of Consciousness I don&#x27;t when you&#x27;re daydreaming you&#x27;re not actively producing those thoughts right it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re like you&#x27;re like a receptacle for the thoughts and uh so I think it&#x27;s this like this an important kind of epistemological question is are we locally producing the content in our minds or are we somehow downloading them from elsewhere sure I think that is probably going to be proven by some sort of you know scientific model of the future right now electromagnetism as we know it decays over and attenuates over SpaceTime so we don&#x27;t have a good model for like how that transmission might occur you know like nutrino information transfer but uh increasingly in Vogue is this um extended electrodynamics model which uh uh you know NASA and uh uh not the doe the National Science Foundation in NASA just launched this podcast and like how put off and all these interesting like kind of figures in UFO world but also with some pretty impressive bonafides just in science as well uh you got a former Skunk Works guy you know um some Navy scientists all righty fellas it&#x27;s time to talk about personal grooming which is not just about looking good it&#x27;s about feeling good whether it&#x27;s gearing up for a

extended electrodynamics and this is basically a model that involves a scaler field so unlike classical electrodynamics uh you don&#x27;t get the attenuation over SpaceTime so you can have you can have basically In classical electr Dynamics you just have one electromagnetic wave a transverse herzan wave so you have um uh a magnetic field uh an electric field and wave propagation and all three are perpendicular to one another and so because of that you get this attenuation you get electrons pairing off you know and you know you get this Decay function on the signal but in this scalar field you can get like scalar longitudinal waves you get all these interesting wave types and you don&#x27;t get the same Decay and so maybe we are downloading thoughts via one of these sort of scalar field waves that would just be one thought experiment I don&#x27;t know right but I do think something like that will get proven out just given the phenomenology of thought or invention where like a wheel pops up in Africa at the same time as South America this this you look at the phenomenology of science it looks way more like Revelation than it does quantum mechanics or something it looks like something&#x27;s popping into the person&#x27;s head every single time whether it&#x27;s dck staring at the fire at Cambridge coming up with the dck equation or Einstein at his desk as a patent cler like it literally it&#x27;s the exception to the rule is like I just finished the equation on the Whiteboard no you&#x27;re like in the shower you&#x27;re like uh there&#x27;s so many examples um uh so yeah I think you know Heisenberg at helgoland you know making all these downloads about you know how how you know electrons make Quantum leaps and you know electron cloud like it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s sort of constant so I so Tim Taylor saying that it&#x27;s like yeah I think that&#x27;s real but then and then and then I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s hard to sift through some of the other quacky I&#x27;m not I don&#x27;t want to endorse any of the stuff that he says is definitively real but interesting he seems like the most I mean it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s so elusive I think is making makes him so interesting yes you know especially the way she talks about some of the stuff that he was involved with like like you&#x27;ve met the dude right yeah I had I had like a 20 minute call with him really yeah how did that come about uh I can&#x27;t say because I will say anything on any podcast I&#x27;ll always be public but I want to protect sources yeah sources exactly I just don&#x27;t want to like burn relationships um can you tell what you talked about him with what you talked about with him um yeah well the impetus on my end so I always I invest um Adventure capitalist oh Stephen did you leave your phone out we got to put our phones out there we got paler in the building bro we can&#x27;t let all our info get suck the out of here dude he&#x27;s said paler Honey Trap Jesse Michaels I I am I am not I am not you&#x27;re furthering the internet [ __ ] Daddy come on man just kidding just kidding but no you you uh what you talked about on Julian dory&#x27;s podcast a great great podcast you guys went into like your whole background into investing and how you you&#x27;re invest basically you invest Peter Teal&#x27;s money exact exactly yeah love Julian great guy and um yeah so I I I worked at the the family office for for a long amount of time and even even now um I still have a contract with them and I do investing and uh but I mainly focus on the show it&#x27;s like 90 95% show at this point um but uh yeah so one one of the companies that I was invested in was uh you know a rocket company and they were struggling rocket rocketry is incredibly hard it&#x27;s it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s got a very high failure rate yeah yeah yeah yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s absurd I mean the amount of you&#x27;re talking about like thousands of sub components and like you know one thing fails and you get this Chain Reaction the whole thing screws up so uh we had had you know a couple of failures and I always try to keep my um you know uh investment stuff and uh you know the the the quacky stuff that I&#x27;m into I always try to keep those separate um for for for many reasons but I&#x27;m kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel as far as you know it&#x27;s like oh we&#x27;re struggling to get off the ground and I know a startup rocket company yeah it&#x27;s a startup rocket company yeah yeah yeah and so I know about um you know uh Tim Taylor being this NASA Mission controller who uses Consciousness protocols to get rockets off the ground and I also know about the history of rocketry where it&#x27;s like Jack parsons&#x27;s the you know founder of JPL basically the American rocket program or chovsky the equivalent in uh Russia or warneron brown like all of these guys believed in versions of this so I&#x27;m scraping the bottom of the barrel that&#x27;s so crazy yeah basically like in my you know in putting my investment hat on I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m a materialist reductionist like I don&#x27;t want to bring the woooo stuff in but again it&#x27;s you know I I I&#x27;m like if I have access to this guy I gotta you know find a way to meet him pret pretend I&#x27;m not interested in UFOs yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah genius Yeah Yeah well yeah I I actually that was literally the impetus actually was like helping on the rocket stuff so it actually wasn&#x27;t as much like the UFO thing right and so we yeah we spoke and he said some interesting stuff he was like he you know most of it was actually kind of very like like kind of platitudes around the American Cosmic style stuff like you know use these protocols and tap in and like don&#x27;t use your phone and I was like I already read that in the you know book that Pula you know published but thank you and then um he was also like look if you want the rocket to work you know maybe you have to get aligned with what they want and I was like who is they you like the non-human intelligence he said this to you knowing that you weren&#x27;t you didn&#x27;t bring you didn&#x27;t bring this first he brought it up first no I I brought it I oh I didn&#x27;t bring I bring didn&#x27;t bring up non-human intelligence first he was the one to bring yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I just asked questions about Rockets bless you bless you I just I just iess bless you I just I was just asking questions about the the rocket and getting it to work wow yeah yeah and so did you ask did you follow up on that when he was like they did you ask who they were I I don&#x27;t remember exactly I mean I&#x27;m sure I did um and I&#x27;m sure I was sure that when he said they he was talking about non-human intelligence either due to a follow-up question that I asked or something he made that kind of clear so yeah I don&#x27;t know what to make of this stuff man I mean he even said like apparently like he knows Elon right he has to know Elon he works for Elon and at SpaceX and like watches the rockets and supposedly is part of nro where they have to like watch everything that happens around the rocket with the satellites and the drones or whatever I I I think so I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know you know I&#x27;ve heard that and um pulus tweeted that and but yeah I I think he does work occasionally with with Elon I know he works on some I think you know some serious launches he also works at Aerospace corporation which is a very interesting um company um they&#x27;re sort of like remind me what that one is they&#x27;re like a I think they&#x27;re kind of like a think tank they have like 5,000 employees split between Virginia and you know Fairfax area and Elsa Gund and um I think they yeah they show up in interesting places around the UFO question for sure Aerospace Corporation yep yeah yeah I don&#x27;t know like my world got turned upside down when when when which I talk about it at nauseum on the show but like when bledo came in here and talked about this stuff and then after recent after that I became aware of the miragen documentary which flipped my world upside down again yeah yeah yeah yeah and I&#x27;ve been looking at this whole topic through that lens ever since then sure and it really makes a ton of sense yep well there yeah I mean that&#x27;s an example of like should we like talk about so so this guy Paul benowitz is outside kitland Air Force Space he sees this like uh vertical takeoff and Landing occur of probably some exotic you know craft or whatever which to me doesn&#x27;t mean look away it&#x27;s like what is that what&#x27;s the initial thing he saw and then Rick doie used an Air Force office special investigations officer enters into his life and kind of drives him crazy he&#x27;s told that he&#x27;s communicating with aliens via these signal is across the street beaming sh into his house telling him they&#x27;re aliens that are like running out of gas on their planet and they&#x27;re on their way here yep yep yeah so pretty n pretty nuts so now like so so after watching the documentary and learning the story this guy Paul benowitz and seeing how this this world really works behind the scenes like I I have to just assume that most of this stuff that is going on is just super secret military technology and there&#x27;s a huge apparatus and bureaucracy of people behind the scenes that are just involved in making information murkier right and like what they were doing with Paul if I understand it correctly was they were because he was in the UFO field he was part of muon and all this stuff so they were trying to use him as a conduit of dis info to Poison the Well Y and tried and because they knew there was also Russian spies in the UFO Community out west so they thought okay we can just throw a couple curveballs through Paul benowitz it&#x27;ll throw off the Russians and they won&#x27;t know what we really have going on so now I look at people like in the media today like and I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m you&#x27;re going to have to explain this stuff to me better but like people like grush people like all these whistleblowers people like uh bledo like okay is he Paul benowitz is he a Paul benowitz is he a Paul the thing with PLO is like there&#x27;s like CIA people NSA people nro people like the guy uh that he talked about that map the moon for the Apollo missions was like visiting him and like befriending him and telling him all this secret stuff Y and then like god dude it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s too much yeah it&#x27;s extremely confusing I mean I here&#x27;s what I would say that seems like a massive waste of resource like to what end why why are you why are you um getting all these kind of super high up guys at Nasa CIA to visit this guy driving to North Carolina from from the middle of Florida so but that points to there being some real like Proto architecture underneath like there&#x27;s a different you can try to you can attempt to manipulate or like shade a thing differently and I&#x27;m by the way I&#x27;m not saying I have no evidence that this at all happened in for example bled so&#x27;s case um and he seems like a really Earnest good guy to me and I&#x27;m I&#x27;m hopefully can go talking about very very sweet sweet guy yeah yeah um as as his daughter she was she was in here with him when he came in awesome yeah their whole family seems really cool um but I think you can have an experience and you can shade that experience differently versus like you didn&#x27;t experience anything to begin with because it&#x27;s like why are you spending all this like Manpower and resources you know like it&#x27;s like this huge waste of resources otherwise and so if it&#x27;s it&#x27;s all passage material or all some Honey Trap or like I I just that feels like a little crazy to me and then you have all this you have like so you have to think probabilistically with all this stuff so like there&#x27;s the stuff where like the adjustment per like the crazy stuff like to me I hold that extremely Loosely I catalog it as very low probability and I&#x27;ll look for corroboration in the future for it but like if you&#x27;re like do you believe that&#x27;s definitely a thing like no I don&#x27;t have no idea right but then you have things like you have this book called UFOs and nukes by a guy named Robert Hastings and he document we&#x27;ve talked about this he he documents 167 Q cleared ICBM security Personnel radar operators guys that work most psychologically sound people in the military right they&#x27;re on the PRP program the personal reliability program where they have to report if they&#x27;re taking ibuprofen or Tylenol they inherently have to be the the the Paradigm of a sound mind because you are guarding the crown jewels like you would never let you know crazy person to a nuke right um and and in certain cases they have their finger on the button uh and so uh uh all these guys see Tic Tacs saucers orbs often they&#x27;re messing with comms links shutting down the nukes rendering them inoperable in the case of you know Malmstrom 67 Robert Solace um uh and you know 64 vandenbberg you have a nuke wrapping around in Atlas 5 dummy missile and taking it out of the sky and then you have Air Force office of special investigations people like Rick do in fact Rick doie is literally one of these people who shows up with this guy Mario Woods at Ellsworth Air Force Base in 1977 and swearing them to secrecy and saying you know never talk about this again and and and and demoting them in cases where they do come out when they speak to Robert Hastings Robert Hastings getting threatening phone calls and so to me if you were to you know like you have to think about everything as like a database and it&#x27;s like okay there&#x27;s one thing if you have like the you know National UFO Reporting Center or muon it&#x27;s another thing if you have this you know database that which I would call UFOs and nukes of these inherently very credible people coming forward saying they&#x27;ve seen things yes and then did you know sleeping less than 6 hours per night nearly doubles your risk of death poor sleep is also linked to obesity heart disease high blood pressure diabetes depression and weakened immune system I&#x27;ve struggled with sleep for a while and I&#x27;m not alone the CDC reports over 35% of adults in the US sleep less than the recommended 7 hours many sleep supplements contain melatonin and other ingredients that create dependencies cause morning grogginess and lose their effectiveness over time and that is why I take evening being by Verso after 3 years of perfecting the formula they created a melatonin free drink mix with clinically studied patented ingredients it&#x27;s formulated to an active mind helps you fall asleep faster stay asleep longer and improves deep and REM sleep without creating dependencies or causing morning grogginess I look forward to my evening being night cap every night now and it&#x27;s become a staple in my nightly routine because it not only helps me stay asleep longer fall asleep faster but I wake up with far more energy I hop out of bed quicker and in a better mood and it tastes great which is why it&#x27;s become my new night cap click the link in the description or head on over to v.s o/d Danny and use my coupon code Danny at checkout to save 15% off your first order again hit the link in the

some us deep State cabal thing like okay maybe but even then your null hypothesis gets pretty Fantastical and weird if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying but then you look at Fukushima Le loo which is a town in uh uh right next to Fukushima next to the prefracture where they have their civilian energy nuclear energy grid and they&#x27;ve had it there since the 70s they&#x27;re famous for their nuclear spill in 2011 right and in uh uh the 9s they built a museum dedicated to UFOs and vice did a documentary about how Obsessed the town&#x27;s people are with UFOs and it&#x27;s probably due to the nuclear energy presence and you have a famous case in bar loce Argentina where they have their Civ civilian nuclear grid where uh you know commercial pilot sees a UFO and you have stories around Chernobyl and so this nuclear connection is extremely important then you hear about uh uh UFOs basically being bounded up within nuclear secrecy and battel Memorial Institute being you know very big part of UFO research uh you look at the special definition of nuclear material under the atomic energy commission which was in 1954 and it&#x27;s basically any material with emitting any sort of radiation so Alpha Beta gamer radi anything uh is born secret and it&#x27;s restricted data meaning that you don&#x27;t even have to fall under the direct clearances of government if you are a private Aerospace Corporation and you pick this stuff up it is restricted for you too so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like born classified so you have all this evidence that there&#x27;s this kind of like doe Atomic research UFO thing that&#x27;s been going on for for a very long time and I think that&#x27;s where you have to start this coherent picture and then yeah there&#x27;s scops there&#x27;s weird [ __ ] but I think what people don&#x27;t understand is that um if there are scops around a thing it means the thing is more likely to be real how many how many Bigfoot scops do you know none yeah because nobody would [ __ ] believe it right scops are 95% true and 5% false and the 5% that&#x27;s false matters a ton because it throws you entirely off the trail it&#x27;s it&#x27;s 95% true and 5% false yes oh really that&#x27;s what people don&#x27;t understand about Sops they think Sops are OPP that&#x27;s sure they think that it&#x27;s 95% false but you You&#x27; dismiss it out of hand if it was 95% false you&#x27;d be like oh it&#x27;s Bigfoot [ __ ] I I&#x27;m not going to believe that UFOs are standard deviations more charismatic than any other if if it&#x27;s the scop well bigo Bigfoot&#x27;s more more believable than a [ __ ] alien coming here from Another Universe right it&#x27;s a homed just a big homant right right right which is why and I I actually I&#x27;m I&#x27;m more in the like jacqu valet di Pula line of thinking where I don&#x27;t think you know little green men from Zeta reticuli is the answer to like what we&#x27;re seeing in in you know the airspace shout out to Mike Masters shout out to Mike Masters yeah love Mike m and he does some really important work faor he&#x27;s amazing yeah and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s great because he&#x27;s he&#x27;s thinking about this stuff inductively most people don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re bringing priors into thinking about UFOs that deal with movies they&#x27;ve seen and the zeist and culture and so they&#x27;re not looking at the phenomena ground up first principles and he is and that&#x27;s why Mike Masters is amazing and people should definitely follow him but that&#x27;s what people don&#x27;t so but the SC just I think I think it&#x27;s a really important Point um if if there are Sops around a thing it&#x27;s more likely to be real and then if UFOs are real there are going to be scops around it obviously if you have this like core important truth they&#x27;re going to be scops around it if if you&#x27;re it&#x27;s talking about the nature of reality obviously and but it&#x27;s ephemeral and hard to detect and it&#x27;s like this thing that happens only to certain people of course you&#x27;re going to Coop that manipulate it for narratives and you&#x27;re going to have all these competing factions trying to like overlay their narratives on top of the thing yeah so these things are scop or real is positive sum it&#x27;s not Zero Sum the fact that it&#x27;s real means there&#x27;s going to be a scop the fact that there&#x27;s a scop probably means there&#x27;s an element of reality to it why would why else would they invest Manpower into it right why would they invest so much Manpower at the highest levels and so that&#x27;s I think people don&#x27;t get that and they&#x27;re they snap it to grid they&#x27;re like this is a scop or this is real and it&#x27;s like there are scops and it&#x27;s real it&#x27;s the and that makes it really interesting yes and worthy of Investigation everybody should think for themselves and you should distrust anybody who&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s definitely this mhm that&#x27;s why the the um the Bob Lazar story is so interesting to me and and it stays interesting because like the more we learn about the more we learn about the psychological warfare and The Counter Intelligence stuff like in this current UFO State we&#x27;re in the more light It Shines on The Bob Lazar story in what was it 1980 or something 1990 87 &#x27;87 y so like apparently he was the guy who first came to Area 51 blew the whistle on Area 51 but then I think this this was all part of your um documentary was this a part of your towns and brown documentary it was yeah so like I think one of the questions you asked in the towns and brown documentary which was which was brilliant was why would the CIA let a guy come in who has this crazy history y right he I think and another thing that happened was I think he like recently got in a divorce with with his previous wife who then like killed herself I didn&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s interesting she she like went in her car in her garage and let her car run until like she suffocated this was like a week after they got a divorce oh no I think Bob also owned a strip club in Vegas yeah I know that yeah yeah he did and then what were I think a brothel not not just oh it was brothel yeah yeah you a brothel so the CIA is going to go out and find a and to think they&#x27;re not going to do a background check and find that kind of stuff if it&#x27;s the CIA their most top secret facility on in America well you&#x27;ve seen Oppenheimer right yeah so you remember that Leslie Matt Damon&#x27;s character Leslie grov who&#x27;s running basically the the entire M Hatton project from like a national security standpoint and he says I didn&#x27;t hire uh uh Oppenheimer in spite of his socialist sympathy I hired him because of them and so you H you hire people when it comes to some of these more secret programs sometimes if they do have comprom on them because they&#x27;re more easily controllable so that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily cut against the whole B for them that&#x27;s an argument for them hiring him okay but and discrediting him if he ever decides to Spill the Beans yeah and there&#x27;s there&#x27;s even a so what I was saying in that documentary is John leer is a a CIA cargo pilot cargo Jet Pilot or whatever and the the the son of biler who created the first you know business uh basically private jet in the in the US who&#x27;s known as the autopilot Wizard and actually worked with Thomas towns and brown comes from this like Aerospace like you know Dynasty right and he yeah affiliated with the CIA and say he disaffiliated in &#x27; 83 but definitely was still flying cargo jets for them like into the mid 80s at least so question is like you know we we kind of know that if there is a UFO program it&#x27;s being run partially by the CIA and the CIA has a part in it and so if you&#x27;re the CIA why do you continue unless you&#x27;re extremely dysfunctional and not coordinated why do you continue to pay this guy you know flying cargo jets for you if he&#x27;s leaking your most vital important Secrets because John leer put all the files around Bob Lazar on George nap&#x27;s desk he broke the story so why would you pay who&#x27;s leaking your you know your crown your crown jewel secrets so that that&#x27;s one question and then John leer also had a UFO blog before and was friends with Bob Lazar and this there&#x27;s some story that Bob Lazar says all this UFO stuff&#x27;s crazy and wacky and [ __ ] before he gets hired by Area 51 and S4 but the question stands why would you hire Bob Lazar to your top secret UFO reverse engineering Pro program if your good friend or his good friend John leer was a babbling UFO nut who has a UFO blog like you&#x27;d obviously find that in a background check right yeah so like there&#x27;s a lot to me that points to the CIA wanting the bzar story out again that doesn&#x27;t mean the details of the Bob Lazar story are not incredibly interesting and maybe it&#x27;s 95% true and 5% false and maybe this Billy Meers sports model that he worked on was real I don&#x27;t know uh maybe gravity a and gravity B are highlevel Frameworks that if you are working on a secret UFO program you need some initiate you know stem student to start to develop an interest an interest in but you need to protect this from getting into adversary hands so you put it out through these kind of this quacky person who is discreditable in Bob Lazar and so it&#x27;s kind of this limited hangout of a person where you can always retract it you can always point to you know say he faked his MIT you know educational credentials and you could say you say all this stuff about B you say the the the brothel thing but maybe there are elements of it that you know are are are very real so I think it&#x27;s this incredibly intriguing story and what I want to be clear about is I think like the Corbell and George nap reporting on it are awesome like I think it&#x27;s we should be looking into this stuff but to me if you&#x27;re not thinking about it through a a meta lens of like the CIA probably wanted elements of this out I think you&#x27;re losing the plot you know know I think you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to fall for you&#x27;re you can&#x27;t take the thing at face value you need to understand that it&#x27;s being pushed for some reason and I think there&#x27;s even a John leer interview where I believe he says a guy named I think it was like an admiral mclen he says that this guy who was part of like Legacy UFO efforts told him that he needed to leak the Lazar story because he knew that it was discreditable but that there were it was mostly true but also discreditable um and so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s literally a interview cuz leer was clearly kind of unhinged and a little you know crazy himself where he&#x27;s just saying what I&#x27;m telling you now which is that the Lazar story again there could be elements of truth but it was put out because it was discreditable and I think that&#x27;s a the way a lot of this stuff works but what was the benefit of putting it out was it to recruit new Talent was it oh tons it&#x27;s it&#x27;s yeah so it&#x27;s like if you want to throw the adversary off the trail or like keep things fundamentally protected but have initiates you know uh develop Intrigue and want to be recruited or whatever like it&#x27;s like the perfect way to do it yeah um so it&#x27;s like Tech protection it&#x27;s adversary signaling it&#x27;s recruitment it&#x27;s increasing the surface area it&#x27;s if you expect a leak in the future you can manage that leak because you&#x27;re you&#x27;re like conditioning people and like softening the blow for something you expect to leak in the future anyways there&#x27;s so many reasons to get in front of and do something like that and Ben Rich who was you know president of of uh locked Skunk Works you know their most secretive you know Advanced Aerospace aircraft division at the time responsible for you know the SR71 and you know You2 um he uh was complaining at the time how he was basically saying like you know I have to spend tons and tons of money on Tech protection because the f-117a which was their first stealth fighter had just crashed in Bakersfield in 1986 leer actually established credibility with kaas with George nap&#x27;s um you know newss station by giving them information on that f-17 oh wow yeah so there&#x27;s some interesting ties there the the final thing is John leer and Jim Goodall his buddy had been camping outside of Area 51 for the better part of a decade taking pictures of all these Advanced Recon stealthcraft and so the the security knew him they know they all knew who he was so it&#x27;s like if he&#x27;s leaking stuff it&#x27;s probably for a reason and so I think you know people like Ben Rich were smart really smart he used to Ben Rich used to call UFOs unfunded opportunities and I think you know he was kind of using um John le to those ends if that makes sense again I don&#x27;t know if you have to throw the baby out with the bath water and say that we&#x27;re not you know reverse engineering UFOs in in sort of you know secret compartments of the government but that&#x27;s the way you I think you need that meta lens to to to look at it through if that makes sense and on my list on my on top of my to-do list is read the book that jacqu fet wrote about this stuff where he talks about Bob Lazar drinking something weird or something yeah messengers of deception jock Valle Jac Val&#x27;s always I&#x27;ve had a bunch of convers I love that guy you know French Godfather of UFOs right and um he&#x27;s always thought B Bazar was like just completely full of [ __ ] um which which I I think there are more elements of truth to it and and there&#x27;s actually a great movie coming out about Bob Lazar by um my buddy uh uh Luigi and it&#x27;s called project gravitar and I do think it&#x27;s actually going to corroborate that Lazar probably was at Area 51 I just yeah he&#x27;s working on it with Lazar he&#x27;s working on it with Lazar yeah it&#x27;s gonna be epic it&#x27;s going to be really awesome um but yeah so in messengers of deception uh jacqu fet says you know uh uh and what about the the the liquid that that Bob Lazar said he was you know meant to drink or whatever and the memory lapses that it caused and immediately my mind goes to MK Ultra and I&#x27;m like yeah you know and and and I Lazar admits that and I think he&#x27;s admitted it to Luigi and he&#x27;ll you know he&#x27;ll he&#x27;ll talk about this the fact that they like made him drink a weird liquid and he&#x27;ll forget certain things something kind of you know weird going on there I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know what it is a scop wrapped in a mystery wrapped in another scop wrapped in some sort of strategic deception I love what Annie Jacobson says in her book about when they&#x27;re first flying the first jet planes out of out of air 51 he the CIA Pilots had to bring gorilla masks in the cockpit oh remember that oh no the CIA Pilots when they were flying those first jet planes in case they came in visual distance of a civilian airplane they had to put on the gorilla masks no way how crazy is that that&#x27;s crazy that&#x27;s my favorite one oh that&#x27;s so f is that an Area 51 that&#x27;s an Area 51 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you spent a lot of time with jacqu Fil-A right you guys you guys are did you live you live close to him or you live you you used to live closer to LA right yeah I I lived in La for for most of my life and um no I just whenever we&#x27;re in the same city I tried to hit him up and visit him and um he&#x27;s amazing he&#x27;s just a very very deep thinker and there are clearly a lot of layers to his understanding of the UFO a lot of layers the most interesting thing to me and I&#x27;m interested to hear your thoughts on this was in Diana&#x27;s book she talks about him being obsessed with angels and demons yes and this medieval spiritual stuff right oh yeah and she says that he gave her a book about the devil uhhuh with 666 pages and he said to her if you want to understand the stuff read the book MH about the devil MH what the hell I don&#x27;t know what to make of that I don&#x27;t think Diana did either when I asked her I&#x27;m like did you read the book she goes no can&#x27;t find it she go lost it um no he didn&#x27;t give it to her he just like showed her the book find book okay okay got it got it got it yeah um I don&#x27;t know man I mean I will say what you know you know the concept of Lindy so it&#x27;s this idea that the current age of something should Define its expected survival in the future so really old things are very durable and are probably more true or right or like you know yeah just valid um so like the Bible very Lindy Plato very Lindy you know modern architecture or you know I don&#x27;t know the Museum of ice cream not Lindy you know like right and so okay um I would say that really applies to the UFO question whatever we are seeing now is what we&#x27;ve historically seen forever and that&#x27;s what ja Val&#x27;s book passport to Magonia touches on it&#x27;s like you know Celtic medieval you know fairies and leprechauns angels and demons and you know passport to MOS it&#x27;s based on uh uh the Denis of Magonia and medieval France it&#x27;s probably what we&#x27;re seeing today and they almost pattern match one to one in terms of you know the actual story it&#x27;s like somebody comes down there&#x27;s missing time involved there&#x27;s sometimes implants and physical marks there&#x27;s healings but people also freak out sometimes they get sick afterwards it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just very common and so I think when you get into the religious stuff a modern scientist would say oh that&#x27;s crazy or whatever but if you treat that as a real phenomenology in the past if you treat you know like Diana Pula has in her book St Francis of aisi you know experience on Mount lever in 13th century Italy if you treat that as a historical artifact which I think you should then I think a lot of these things were just UFOs now where it gets weird is like then you said say oh UFOs are just Angels and Demons like so many people say that and then you just you give them one more question say think Tucker Carlson says that more oh he says it more than anybody and and you know I&#x27;m a fan of Tuckers but like then you ask any ask Tucker ask anybody then you say what&#x27;s an angel what&#x27;s a demon they&#x27;ll have no idea they&#x27;ll like I don&#x27;t know what are you talking about you know Clinton there you go yeah yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what it&#x27;ll say by the way love that [ __ ] podcast you did with with Alex Jones oh thank youing one of one of your original ones one of the OG yeah yeah he he&#x27;s hilarious man I love Alex Jones he&#x27;s so funny dude that was that was pure entertainment it was it was so with painting rocks are you painting rocks with Alex Jones well we did this thing in in Austin and like at like Infowars HQ and he had covid and he gave me Co what yeah so I share some genetics with oh my God and and then and it was just I we I don&#x27;t know it was fun we shot guns and stuff but the vibe was like a little off and then my friend Reva she was like in LA at the time and he was coming into LA and she was like we got to just make it Gonzo weird and funny and we got a Paint Rock she bought all these board games and stuff and it was just genius light in the mood it was awesome it was so funny y there it is what is the title of it isn&#x27;t it like painting rocks with Alex Jones alexes yeah getting drunk and painting rocks getting drunk and painting Rock and he just said the that&#x27;s such an OG Vice title yeah ex it felt like very Vice it felt like just I feel like your stuff is very Vice too like you have a lot of episodes like that too but yeah he&#x27;s just like oh man he&#x27;s such he&#x27;s so fun to spend time he oh he looks so he looks like he&#x27;s he&#x27; be such fun to hang out with he so fun he spent that whole day at my house and I gave him all these books and it was just such a good fun vibe what were you guys drinking I think tequila tequila yeah yeah and he went he was going he&#x27;s he go yeah I know what he&#x27;s saying right now he goes He this is so weird he goes uh I didn&#x27;t have a sexual desire for my for my mother but when I look at her what oh my god when I look at her you know she&#x27;s so beautiful and then I&#x27;ll be like Alex you are crazy but in the best way dude he is he is such a smart dude he&#x27;s actually extremely smart he&#x27;s such a smart dude but like I like he the thing about Alex Jones people a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is that he throws so many so much [ __ ] at the wall like there&#x27;s the whole there&#x27;s the there&#x27;s the meme right like Alex Jones always like he gets stuff right over time yeah he&#x27;s like the difference between conspiracy theory and the truth is six months you know Alex Jones was right again but like if you saw the volume of [ __ ] that he says you would realize how much he actually doesn&#x27;t get right he he does get a ton of [ __ ] right there&#x27;s so much survivorship bias he constantly just throwing [ __ ] out there right of course he&#x27;s going to predict something right yeah you know the 911 stuff is crazy how he predict like literally called out that Al-Qaeda was going to fly planes in the tower goes Osama specifically it&#x27;s wild that is [ __ ] enough I think he&#x27;s like I think he&#x27;s tapped in it goes back to our conversation on Consciousness I feel like he&#x27;s like a a a bit of a prophet he&#x27;s like one of these people it&#x27;s like a a generically magnified receptor and like I think he&#x27;s like an antenna he&#x27;s like an antenna and a lot of bad [ __ ] gloms on to him he&#x27;s like Kanye too where it&#x27;s like so much bad stuff gloms on to Kanye then so much good too and like I think that&#x27;s where people like don&#x27;t understand somebody like him he can be so wildly wrong when he&#x27;s wrong yeah but when he&#x27;s right it&#x27;s like nobody else was right like it&#x27;s like a download that he got that was so prophetic and so like ahead of his time it&#x27;s really amazing yeah and it&#x27;s almost like you have to you have to be able to get rid of that filter for that stuff to happen because if you have that filter and you&#x27;re like constantly like sitting and mulling on things before you talk about them or before you claim them whatever it is it&#x27;s like automatically that is that is like you&#x27;re not going to have that superpower but if you don&#x27;t have the filter built in at all and you&#x27;re just constantly just coming in and it&#x27;s going out it&#x27;s flowing through you then it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re more tapped in somehow and I yeah it&#x27;s definitely you can see that with cont yeah it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like automatic writing where like you like you get the first like page you write is like contrived it&#x27;s coming from your like prefrontal corex like this intellectual thing and then boom you get into the flow and you&#x27;re on autopilot and something&#x27;s coming through you in the Muses you&#x27;re taing the muses and yeah I agree you you can&#x27;t have the filter and I think and that&#x27;s why I get so much WR that&#x27;s the double- EDG sword that you have dou sword you have to be okay with it and you have to be Discerning it&#x27;s condescending to an audience to say I&#x27;m going to a prior I conceal you from this entire thing instead of I&#x27;m going to let you think for yourself and there&#x27;s a lot that this guy says is completely quacky and wrong and there&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s super right and like but we&#x27;re not going to like you&#x27;re not going to be like Bubble Boy and bubble bubble girl who they you know like like like like siphon you off from like this like you know really important you know possible you know slivers of information that are really important golden nuggets yeah totally where where were we going before we start talking about we talk how did we get to Alex Oh demons I said Hillary Hillary Clinton yeah yeah talking about Jo Vala saying part of I mean if you get into like there&#x27;s like a a gnostic through line in thinking about UFOs so like you&#x27;re familiar with gnosticism yeah gnosticism yeah yeah I&#x27;m familiar with that so like you know the idea that these are like AR arani you know uh protectors or tricksters Protectors of the material world but the you know the there&#x27;s like a you know there&#x27;s like a a demi urge that you know runs the material world and that&#x27;s like a lower God and then there&#x27;s like a higher God and this is not something I would fully subscribe to I think they&#x27;re too anti I think the material world&#x27;s very special and we can learn all these amazing things from it I also think there&#x27;s higher stuff going on um so I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m more like I don&#x27;t know like a neoplatonist or something but there&#x27;s definitely some Gnostic thought and through lines in this world and like I think that is one lens you can overlay the whole UFO question with but as to you know I don&#x27;t know yeah he&#x27;s super into fallen angels and he&#x27;s interested in demons and I don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t quite you know explain that well the demon thing is interesting when you look at the Virginia Brazil case the thing that smelled like sulfur and call it the three women they go it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like a demon you know it&#x27;s yeah smelled like a demon had horns and eyes like a demon uhhuh and killed a guy uhhuh uhhuh yeah no to to some of these things patterned or even the rumors of Roswell there&#x27;s this CIA leaon named Chase Brandon who wrote a book called cryptos conundrum and the you the alien being that comes out of Roswell and I think there&#x27;s some true stuff that comes out you think there do you think we really have a being that came out of Roswell I I again I would say low probab high probability that Roswell happened something there was a crash there and then lower probability that there was a being I don&#x27;t know what you know maybe 50ish percent but at decently High there&#x27;s a so many towns people at Roswell like something happened here beings came out Edgar Mitchell who I know this is going to come M of the waters because he was you know an Apollo 14 astronaut who then got really interested in Consciousness and Aliens you know this trip on the way back to the Moon almost this conversion experience he was from Roswell and it&#x27;s like an Open Secret there that something happened um and then the beings I would rank is lower probability than like the memory metal that Jesse Marcel this Air Force flight surgeon I think definitely collected and I think it did make it to right right Airfield the TR TR Trum trinium what is the word for that metal the TR tritium or night trium Tri no not tridium it was like uh it was like there was a crazy uh metal that there was a name a word a name for it where it would bend and go back to its original shape oh you&#x27;re talking about the um Titanium nickel alloy that so there&#x27;s a contract between uh right Airfield and battel Memorial Institute from 1949 that my buddy the gerb video UAP gerb everybody check out his channel shout out to gerb amazing researcher you should have him on he&#x27;s awesome um yeah so there&#x27;s this titanium and I think it&#x27;s a uh Nick I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a crazy word right it&#x27;s yeah I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s titanium nickel alloy yes yeah tit titanium nickel alloy and that&#x27;s there&#x27;s evidence that we that we have that we have that well we definitely have that that was Declassified as a material that we have in 1961 then you have to ask the question why does Batel Memorial Institute that runs all of our nuclear stuff have a contract with right Airfield where the Roswell materials were yeah nitol n nitol that&#x27;s what it was that&#x27;s the word yep so so that they have a contract to study this stuff between right Airfield and battel Memorial Institute in 1949 again there&#x27;s the nuclear connection and then I think in&#x27; 61 or 62 it comes out that nit all&#x27;s a thing but why are you keeping it secret for 12 years and then Nall is really interesting because it exactly pattern so Jesse Marcel this Air Force flight surgeon he comes out later in 1979 I think saying you know actually I was like forced to pose with this you know fake material and you know then project Mogul comes out later the Air Force says that you know it it was just a weather balloon or whatever but actually it was this kind of you know Memory Metal that was like extremely very uh uh durable and like you could you could apply a lot of stress to it and it would kind of like uh it had like shape memory it would go it would go back into its original form and look unperturbed and nitol is that you can that&#x27;s we know that that&#x27;s the case yeah that is crazy and James Fox&#x27;s Witnesses literally said this is the exact same stuff they found in Brazil when that thing crashed there you go yeah so that he explained it like he was like foil that you could bend around and it would go back to its original form and Robert sarbacher who was very close with Thomas towns and brown is probably working on a lot of this stuff talks about material thinly layered materials that you know do similar things from that time yeah so I there&#x27;s I think they&#x27;re there and then the bodies i&#x27; you know rank a little lower probability but I&#x27;m I&#x27;ve heard from some pretty credible sources that you know I think there&#x27;s something there too so what do you make about what and moment of contact is and I think more by the way is going to come out about the V case moment of contact is in some ways better what else is going to come

pursuing that he&#x27;s so yeah so I think I&#x27;m I&#x27;m really excited to see what happens there but like I would rank that as higher probability as far as the beings than Roswell because we have witnesses who were alive and we have them on video saying they were right there three women who like how about the scene where they go to the guy&#x27;s house and he&#x27;s like he pulls his gun out and he&#x27;s about to shoot him totally that scene and and then you know there&#x27;s this doctor that reportedly died when the thing was in his hands and this kind of amonia like smell which keeps coming up so yeah he said that the the Doctor Who did the X-ray said the whole Hospital spend like ammonia for a week there yeah crazy no no no sulfur I&#x27;m sorry sulfur sulfur sulfur which is the smell of the devil so yes weird then you have to ask yourself the question like yeah how much of that stuff is actually just historical and real like we if something has a religious veneer to it we throw it out as not historical but we have to remember like pre-enlightenment everybody was religious everybody so it&#x27;s history it&#x27;s not religion just because something has a religious overlay to it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s inherently not true you can say a lot of the things in the Bible feel Beyond The Pale for you to believe or whatever like the Seas parting in the old test whatever but to say that like somebody definitely didn&#x27;t have this experience that seemed paranormal we put this religious overlay over there I think is extremely closed mind sure yeah we have all these examples now of people experiencing paranormal stuff and it&#x27;s just not a religious overlay because that&#x27;s not the kind of Mythology of today Sciences right right yeah again like you said don&#x27;t can&#x27;t throw the baby out with bath water but there&#x27;s um when when it comes to the crashes though what do you make of the crashes like if these things are so Advanced if they&#x27;re extra teral or if they&#x27;re future humans that are 500,000 years in the future why are they crashing yeah this gets into weird uh stuff but I think there&#x27;s high-powered radar that was developed in the 40s um I think Watson watt was like the first guy that developed radar that was in um in Britain and then we started to experiment with more and more High powerered radar and that we had that at white sand and I think we had that probably at right Airfield and I think we&#x27;ve had that at Air Force bases across the US and then I think they&#x27;re attracted to nuclear stuff and so I think they they can be disrupted by some of these high powerered Radars and this is where I it&#x27;s the conversation kind of gets weird because I and they&#x27;re not aware of our high powerered radar I I think that&#x27;s possible man I mean there&#x27;s also yeah I think it&#x27;s possible like they could not be care like okay if they&#x27;re talking about directed energy weapons is that like similar yeah and it&#x27;s a weird I don&#x27;t like talking about it cuz I think it&#x27;s kind of [ __ ] up to be honest like I don&#x27;t think that um should be you know yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of weird but yeah how so what do you mean well just just messing with these things at all I think they&#x27;re not kind of interfering with us and so we shouldn&#x27;t interfere with them oh totally you know um but but yeah I think as far as that being possible I don&#x27;t think we know what they are I think we assuming oh they traveled the cosmos to get here and they&#x27;re so Advanced or whatever and then they they get messed up due to our you know like like how do we have the hubis to think that we could like pop them out of the sky with this stuff it&#x27;s like we don&#x27;t know what they are and like why they&#x27;re here and there are ways in which you could be extremely Advanced and then ways in which you could be super simple like AGI is way more advanced not AGI any AI model is way more advanced on like vector calculus than like a human way more Advan when it comes to like Snap intuition and like Judgment of like kind of multimodal stuff like across different domains humans are way more advanced than AI right so this idea that like they are stepwise better than us in like every single way and can&#x27;t crash I think is ridiculous and then it also is predicated on this space alien thing that like again we don&#x27;t know like they could just exist in this kind of interior fabric of reality they could be kind of mostly ignoring us outside of certain things that light up in our population around Consciousness or nuclear you know things of that nature and so yeah the development of certain you know weapons technology interfere with them and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s crazy to to say well it might not be as crazy if they were sending things that weren&#x27;t biological right if they were sending sort of drones through reconnaissance drones like kind of like we send to other planets everybody I know who deep on this topic says that the biological stuff they&#x27;re drones and like the the Grays and all this stuff they&#x27;re like 3D printed things they&#x27;re they&#x27;re anatomically compiled like like what is DARPA looking into right now like like uh programming biology so like that&#x27;s probably what they are too and if you think talk look at like all the interactions with the alien beings they&#x27;re always like do not fear do not fear we won&#x27;t hurt you this will take a second and then they like you know there&#x27;s like an incision and they like put an implant in you and then they go away and so like they are doing a a a low-level task they are probably not the beings themselves they&#x27;re probably Von noyman replicator envoys to like achieve a specific function mhm so it&#x27;s not going to be that catastrophic if they lose something no not at all if they lose something through a lightning strike or DW or whatever no it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re little robot Avatar but some people think that they&#x27;re crashing him on purpose right yeah or like yeah it&#x27;s like a donation or a gift jaac Val speculates that I don&#x27;t this is where I you know have no idea yeah but um but I do believe there are crash there are just so many I mean Leonard Stringfield at 119 cases there&#x27;s a guy named Ryan wood who has 104 cases most of which are uncorrelated with the Leonard Stringfield cases so so when you&#x27;re talking about those like anatomically uh 3D printed biological beings that everyone thinks about as like the little aliens yeah when I had Greer in here last week he&#x27;s as soon as I said that to asked him about those things he goes oh that&#x27;s just CIA I&#x27;m like Whit I&#x27;m like what about whitly streber he&#x27;s like oh that&#x27;s all CIA that&#x27;s all CIA mind control stuff he like completely he completely brushed it off as like intelligence black [ __ ] happening yeah he he his easy straw man for anything that he thinks is like fake in the UFO world is it&#x27;s like Intel National Security deep State whatever and like I yeah I just think that&#x27;s like super close close-minded thinking and like I I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know it could be in the case of Whitley Whitley did Whitley has a really interesting story where um he was he did a great podcast with him that everybody should check out but there were experiments done on him as a child at Randolph Air Force Base near San Antonio I believe did he tell you about when he went to Mexico yes yeah that was very strange as well yeah so I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what to make of yeah I don&#x27;t know if you like have like a theory there but I mean and that&#x27;s I think less of an uncommon story than people realize as well these like gate programs these gifted and talent talented student programs recruiting kids stranger things type [ __ ] stranger things yeah exactly yeah Whitley first of all when he came on that podcast I didn&#x27;t know he had an implant and he [ __ ] dropped that on me right when we started recording did you by the way touch the implant or see no I didn&#x27;t touch it but he gave me he showed me a video you should have dude cuz that thing is weird really I touched it he sent me a video of it there&#x27;s a video of it I have and he showed me like the x-rays of it I saw you touch it though yeah that&#x27;s crazy he says that he says that it moves around yeah that&#x27;s what he he said they tried to take it out and it just move like which also is a common thing that you hear of these things move on their own metabolism which is that&#x27;s that&#x27;s very common with the implant thing so again it points to this kind of biological drone thing have you read so have you read all whitle books or or did you just read um no I&#x27;ve just read communion so there&#x27;s a bunch of other stuff oh and I read his book on Jesus actually oh did you really okay I read that one too um but there&#x27;s a lot of there&#x27;s lot of interesting stuff that he didn&#x27;t include in communion that he does include in his other books this fell I had on the show Jason geani is like a a I&#x27;ve seen that episode he is a historian of Whitley streer he&#x27;s read every single book front to back multiple times and like I spent like two hours on the phone with him before I had uh Whitley in here and there&#x27;s a lot of other interesting things like wild wild things that he left out of communion like for example yeah there&#x27;s one scene in one of his books I can&#x27;t remember the name of the book but where he talks about when the alien girl is like riding him okay he says there&#x27;s a CIA guy in the room watching him a CIA guy that he knows watching him have sex with an alien watching him have sex with an alien no way and like like how do you explain that first of all why&#x27; you leave that out of the book yeah what was going I think I talked I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t remember if I asked him about that in the podcast but like there&#x27;s there&#x27;s so many just bizarre and then also like the history of him going to Mexico yeah and like he didn&#x27;t want to talk about that to me on the show I don&#x27;t know if he talked about it with you but like apparently there were some kids who went down to Mexico and he was a part of it where he was at some house that was like guarded by the military and it was all military stuff where they were like subjecting children to watching like like murder videos of people getting like tortured and murdered and stuff to do something to their mind to like to induce some sort of trauma to these children right so if you combine that y with his stories what I don&#x27;t what do you I don&#x27;t know what to make of that well I I do think the inducing of trauma and dissociation is more common than we realize when it comes to these programs that recruit kids and try to find kids with high sigh abilities and this is going to sound nuts to the average person who doesn&#x27;t believe that there&#x27;s any sort of Mind matter interaction or whatever but parapsychology has been studied at Elite University since you know midcentury Stanford Research Institute uh Princeton you know uh uh engineering and anomalous research par lab uh Duke the Ry uh uh uh Center uh from 1931 1960 was the first one in the US and uh I think Aerospace has known about this for for a long time and um unfortunately I think we have a dark past checkered past when it comes to MK Ultra which came out in the church Committee in 1975 and I think MK Ultra and and a lot of this psychic stuff dealt with trying to find kids and and and and and induce trauma and so I don&#x27;t know you know I F I find Whitley to be pretty pretty honest in his readout of things you know like not like a he&#x27;s like a good guy and then like you know I don&#x27;t know what to make of any of this stuff I just listen to what people say and repeat it like me too sure yeah yeah yeah well I think I think um and then you can obviously remember things falsely as your you know kid so I I don&#x27;t know on that but I I would be lying if I weren&#x27;t to say that that didn&#x27;t kind of pattern match to other stories that you hear so Whitley story yeah I just interviewed uh psionic asset on my show oh Jake Barber not Jake Barber but Jake Barber does say he says he kind of hints at this he goes I was traumatized he had a really rough child his stepfather didn&#x27;t treat him super well and he kind of talks about how he was gifted as well where he was like you know he had matched colors up as a kid with major chords and minor chords and so certain colors would make you happy like a major chord certain colors would make you sad like a minor chord and to me like my like almost uh coded read on that is like maybe you know he was part of something as a kid or maybe they like they they they they looked at him yeah maybe maybe early on they thought that he had something kind of special going on and that that again it&#x27;s a a lot of stuff around gate programs in the US I think are going to come out in the next programs gate Gat get gifted and talented education oh yeah I think a lot a lot of stuff there is going to stranger things style stuff I think stranger things as a show will look a lot more real than people now think it is in a couple years from now yeah and there are people I know deeper than me on this who are the tip of the spear as far as investigative research on this stuff so I&#x27;m not trying to blow up their spot and uh yeah but it&#x27;s kind of it&#x27;s kind of weird it&#x27;s kind of weird weird that&#x27;s putting it&#x27;s really it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really like uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s messed up I was I&#x27;m just like my pause with the [ __ ] with people like Jake Barber and um all the whistleblowers for that matter is that if I am a part of this secret government right or this secret Rogue private uh organization that has possession and understands this super Anti-Gravity UFO technology contacting non-human intelligence whatever it is it seems like something that&#x27;s so much more powerful than anything that the US government would even have or any government for that matter and if I wanted to protect my secrets I would absolutely send out fake whistleblowers you know sure I I think we don&#x27;t know exactly what to do with what we have I think we have bits and P okay if take this analogy if you had uh you gave a a thumb drave to a caveman would they have any idea what to do with it they don&#x27;t know information Theory they don&#x27;t have a computer to plug it into they just look at this thing they probably like try to make a fire with it right right right right so like I I think that&#x27;s you know maybe you can get some interesting derivative technology maybe the you know the nickel alloy titanium maybe we&#x27;ve done some interesting stuff with that you know uh maybe there elements of the Philip J Corso day after Roswell you know narrative that are true that some of this stuff has made its way into civil side you know infrastructure yeah elements of it I think there&#x27;s clearly falsities in that book like I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think semiconductors required you know alien Tech to to to you know their their patents of transistors that go back way back to the 30s but by and large I think we&#x27;re extremely confused and in the Stone Age on what we&#x27;ve retrieved and so if you find this stuff and it&#x27;s like Cold War era you say we who do I mean it&#x27;s the US government the US the people who know what&#x27;s going on yeah yeah yeah and and so like yeah I me just like America okay you know I don&#x27;t know if you me me or if you met the guy that&#x27;s working on the craft tell I got a stash Dan yeah yeah no I think I think like the the programs around this stuff I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think they know exactly what they&#x27;re working with or what they&#x27;re doing and to me that explains a lot of like you like you you need in the era of Cold War secrecy um you know we&#x27;re like we&#x27;re like way ahead of like China and Russia on like retrieving this stuff to begin with then like you can keep it super overco compartmentalized right and that&#x27;s fine it doesn&#x27;t matter then all of a sudden if like cold war ends and then now we&#x27;re probably back in another cold war and it&#x27;s this multipolar kind of scary thing and China starts to catch up and like eat our lunch on some of this stuff then all of a sudden you need like some civil side eyes like a lot of our best and brightest are not working at like locked or Northrup or like any of these places so you need to like let certain things out and so that I&#x27;m not cynical about you know um a lot of these whistleblowers I think they&#x27;re they&#x27;re genuinely wanting to come out why they might have some sort of top cover or like why they&#x27;re not dead to me might be explained by you got to kind of let the cat out of the bag somewhat if that makes sense because you need certain eyes on this thing because I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve made a ton of progress in in on many dimensions you know I&#x27;ve heard rumors that we have alien reproduction vehicles or you know Advanced research vehicles that pattern match the UFOs and we&#x27;ve made them flyable and then I just I just don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s like you know how how much progress we&#x27;ve actually made so and then even if we have made progress It&#x27;s really that fundamental question of like if we&#x27;re at parody with China or Russia then this stuff has to come out somewhat if that makes sense um and then we live in this like Information Age too where it&#x27;s just like impossible to keep a lid on this [ __ ] and I do think there&#x27;s there these snowball effects where somebody displays a tremendous amount of Courage like David grush where he pieces together all this stuff and he you know goes forward to the inspector the IC Inspector General gives him a thousand pages and you know offers to say I&#x27;ll go in a skiff with anybody and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll you know show you where the bodies are buried and I can give you the exact addresses of the you know facilities and stuff and it does this in front of Congress and I think if you&#x27;re on the program you&#x27;re you&#x27;re somebody like Jake and you&#x27;re seeing that you&#x27;re like this guy&#x27;s really courageous and it like it inspires you you know it&#x27;s like the banister effect Roger banister broke the 4-minute mile and then 10 people broke the 4-minute mile like 2 years after him I think you see somebody go a little you know you&#x27;ve had like moral qualms about what you&#x27;ve been doing already and you see somebody like you know take it this far and you&#x27;re like okay well I know a little bit more and I can probably help with this effort I&#x27;m I&#x27;m going to go a little farther and so yeah yeah I can see the problem though which you alluded to in that conversation with Jake that if all this super high-tech secretive War stuff that we&#x27;re we&#x27;re working on is so compartmentalized and not available to even people in the highest levels of the military and and you know the highest generals and the president like if we get into a war I&#x27;m sure that Russia and China under their dictatorships they&#x27;re going to be able to get [ __ ] done instantly and they probably don&#x27;t have this problem of compartmentalization and keeping secrets from their actual government yes right so like that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s a huge problem from a national security standpoint I mean read the three body problem and like that&#x27;s how it goes down it&#x27;s like you see like a scientist that you know you&#x27;re the CCP you&#x27;re the you know the pla yeah and you see a scientist like working on some really interesting neutrino info transfer you something like really far out crazy stuff that like you don&#x27;t have you just knock on their door you say we&#x27;re relocating you you&#x27;re working at this base that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s the way it goes that&#x27;s not the way the US the US is like you have these competing factions you have all this you know it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s way more of this kind of uncoordinated octopus right exactly that&#x27;s a good way putting it so I think the reason you know I think a lot of these ndas that people have signed in the Aerospace context to work on this stuff in the past are extremely threatening and there are you know really scary retributions that could occur hypothetically for a lot of these people yeah and then I do think uh whatever Legacy programs like don&#x27;t want anything to come back come out are on their back heels and they&#x27;re like some limited disclosure has to occur and I think they&#x27;re sort of they&#x27;re they&#x27;re kind of like we we don&#x27;t quite know what to do here and I think my hope is there are people on the inside a little more like we need basic ontological truths to come out it&#x27;s like nuclear stuff right like you have nuclear physics are you have programs all over the country it&#x27;s it&#x27;s physics it&#x27;s open source ontological truths the idea that there could be bodies and crafts like people need to know this [ __ ] that&#x27;s crazy yeah and then you know anything that um you know any trade secret that could immediately be weaponized or is low barrier to entry you know blow up the world kind of stuff that obviously should be classified and we just need to think about it reasonably through through through those lens but I do I do think there people on the inside who are just dogmatically pro- secrecy because of it&#x27;s like this like cargo cult bureaucracy thing it&#x27;s just like they don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t understand how to be any other way or something yeah I mean the the most frightening thing is that if this Rogue government that&#x27;s like has its own Air Force military uh Navy whatever that has all this power and has this technology that could essentially like beat any world government govern technology as far as like war or whatever it is like and if they go Rogue and they start and if they decide to start a war against the rest of the world like that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the worst that seems like the scariest thing regarding these companies that have this stuff because what what&#x27;s going to stop them from just keep from keeping more secrets from you and just and just taking this technology and exponentially gaining more information and and revealing more insight into it and understanding more about the universe and keeping that [ __ ] from the US right turns into like a breakway a breakaway military Breakaway it&#x27;s not a country but it&#x27;s like a company that&#x27;s more powerful than any country you know I did find it very interesting that like Matthew livelsberger that Green Beret he blows up a cyber truck in front of Trump Towers so it&#x27;s like this weird message or something symbolic yeah felt kind of symbolic like some sort of meme Warfare thing and then the email he sends to Sam shoemate who goes on Shan Ryan is all about Chinese gravitic propulsion drones which I think is China is not flying with impunity with you know electrogravity propulsion like that&#x27;s game over right like that&#x27;s like we&#x27;re in the Cuban Missile Crisis it&#x27;s been going on for three months or what like that it&#x27;s not that but maybe it&#x27;s sort of a little bit of a shot across the bow bow depending on what was what force was behind that cuz clearly he was dealing with a lot of trauma PTSD and you know I think was like a a good guy in his private life but like what leads somebody who&#x27;s like that to do that and to send that email and I did speak to a Green Beret um about this and he was like maybe this is a way to let out some of the gravity stuff that you know we have made breakthroughs with so think about it like this like maybe you&#x27;re sending a little shot across the bow again to Elon to Trump you know civils side government and you&#x27;re saying we you got some some hardcoree [ __ ] that you don&#x27;t have yeah and again this is deep conspiracy I would hold this very kind of loosely low probability but it goes to the point that you know you&#x27;ve made and then yeah I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know where they are technologically and if they even have the power to sort of to sort of flex and do that but I I do think that Aerospace has some pretty advanced technology that you know that those drones over New Jersey they didn&#x27;t seem like anything special like they seemed moving like regular drones like they they weren&#x27;t moving at light speed or like they weren&#x27;t moving like Tic Tacs making sharp turns they were just like floating around like normal quadcopters they were floating around for longer periods of time than you would ever expect like you know hours and hours at a time they&#x27;d stay stationary so they were exhibiting some kind of exotic effects with the kind of winds and stuff but like yeah generally and then I would make a huge distinction between a lot of people were seeing orbs and like other weird stuff and then there were like the fixed Wing drones that looked like they were meeting FAA Rags which were obviously human and so I would make a clear distinction between those two things I would also make a distinction between the stuff showing up at nuclear bases which if you know Robert Hastings Works yes that looks more I don&#x27;t want to say paranormal because that sounds quacky but that looks more like of the UFO the classic UFO variety you have to classify it understand the New Jersey stuff didn&#x27;t seem like anything near the UFO variety no I I agree with that a lot of it and then you but you had salum Nuclear Plant right there and you had stuff showing up there and at Penny Arsenal right you know stuff was showing up right right right I think I think it was definitely our government or or one of our government contractors that was in charge of that I I don&#x27;t know what they were doing but did you hear the audio of um you know rright Patterson&#x27;s like comms links were down like their power was out for like a few hours like that to me is classic Robert Hastings UFOs and nukes and that was happening around that time what happened with with wght Patterson I thought they just had to I thought they just had to like shut down the runway or something for no the I think the the power was out for for a couple of hours right Patterson the power was out I believe either the power or all comms were down for a little bit yeah and there&#x27;s can you look this up can we find this we should look it up yeah yeah let&#x27;s find let&#x27;s find out yeah I think it&#x27;s on twit is where what would we search how dude right right P right Patterson uh Communications outage right Patterson drone patter Air Force Base experienced a closure of its airspace for about 4 hours late Friday night into early Saturday morning due to the sightings of small unman aerial systems drones in a vicinity of the base the base&#x27;s airspace was closed as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the installation and its residence no property was damaged or residence harmed during the incidence so they closed the airspace okay and there I guess there was maybe there wasn&#x27;t a comms outage it was like it was du it was precautionary because there was stuff flying around it right right huh yeah I did hear I did hear uh I did hear like a um some sort of radio com thing too where they were talking about like shutting down the airspace or I have I have a crazy one for you so in 2010 after Robert Hastings wrote his book which was 2008 yeah Fe Warren experienced an outage for what&#x27;s Fe Warren Fe Warren is a nuclear base in Wyoming oh okay and it experienced an outage for they said 59 minutes but Robert hings did back channeling and it was 24 hours and President Obama was briefed on this now do you Fe Warren out outage uh Atlantic Fe Warren uh yeah outage Atlantic and you&#x27;ll see that this was reported on by like mainstream media and I don&#x27;t know go to broadband no the like the Atlantic like the you know the the periodical or whatever oh and the Atlantic magazine Atlantic magazine Okay Okay Okay magazine magaz Atlantic magazine yeah magazine was it a power outage failure shuts that third article yeah yeah yeah exactly so I okay this is really crazy so President Obama was briefed on this and uh Hastings back channeled with this guy this retired missile technician named John Mills yeah and he uh back channeled with some missile security officers on site and were like there was a Tic Tac flying around all over the base and that caused the outage is this like one of the Minutemen missile silos like where they have those underground icbms I know Malmstrom is I don&#x27;t know if f warrren is maybe but this is what&#x27;s crazy is you can even see in the article at the top of the article engineering so power is crossed out and then it goes into engineering failure I think it&#x27;s covering their ass I think they&#x27;re they don&#x27;t want it to seem like it was attributed to a UFO or to a Tic Tac or whatever which again Robert Hastings back and by the way I should say I think you know I was wrong about the right path thing so I don&#x27;t want to like conflate like this is another thing that I think is is very uh uh legit um but I mean I that&#x27;s that&#x27;s huge when they shut down a nuclear dude Obama was briefed yeah right that&#x27;s big that&#x27;s a big deal oh no [ __ ] yeah and and then you&#x27;re back channeling with these guys who say that it&#x27;s attributed to a Tic Tac flying around in the airspace and then they&#x27;re Crossing out power and they&#x27;re making it seem like it&#x27;s an engineering thing what did that say three other lccs were successfully restarted the suspect LCC remains offline what do LCC uh let&#x27;s see here the LCC uh launch control center oh okay so the LC the launch control centers yeah they lost comms like they couldn&#x27;t launch the thing if they want interrogate each missile in sequence so if they begin to send signals out when they&#x27;re not supposed to receivers on the missiles on the missiles themselves will notice this and send out error codes um left 50 missiles in the dark the missiles then restarted one of the lccs and began to normally wow dude dude that&#x27;s freaky man it&#x27;s really freaky and then you&#x27;re doing you know Hastings who I think is a very honest actor is doing back channeling with these guys and they&#x27;re like there&#x27;s a Tic Tac flying around and that&#x27;s what caused the outage and then I think one of them faces kind of career reprisals as a result of this back Channel with Hastings and stuff so and then you have that it&#x27;s crossed power is cross out and Engineering is put up it&#x27;s like the live editing is shown on the Atlantic article we&#x27;re on um uh we&#x27;re on the brave browser the brave browser browser shows you all I wonder if it shows it in Chrome it does show it in Chrome too it does cuz I put it in my documentary on Hastings okay so anyway so so the right Pat thing that is interesting that it I guess it sounds like they were just incurs there were incursions on right p and then they ended up shutting the airspace down as a result of that wasn&#x27;t a conseling failure so that&#x27;s my bad but I think they were getting ready for the uh the Eagles to win the Super Bowl so so they had to like start figuring out philadelph they knew people were going to be looting and terrorizing the whole town going to turn Afghanistan for a week that&#x27;s funny exactly but that just goes to the point that like if these things are showing up around sensitive military sites yeah it points to the nuclear connection it points to this more generalizable three-body problem narrative where they&#x27;re not just showing up at nuclear sites they&#x27;re showing up at ad Advanced science research sites uh and the most sensitive military sites and that was the case with the New Jersey drone the whole New Jersey drone the the name New Jersey drone is a scop cuz they weren&#x27;t just in New Jersey they were at Lake and heat they in Florida they were in Florida they were everywhere and they weren&#x27;t just drones the the drones were drones when the [ __ ] you could see that were taken down occasionally that blinking red and and green because they&#x27;re meeting FAA RS obviously drones you know like clearly those were drones in fact even the White House statement on the drones uh the Press Secret Trump said well Trump says it&#x27;s very weird very strange it&#x27;s not adversary and they&#x27;re going to the G they&#x27;re they&#x27;re coming from the garage and we know where the garage is so that that&#x27;s interesting right that&#x27;s weird yeah the way he talks is just so confusing sometimes it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very confusing but then his his white the press secretary tries to minimize it and say there&#x27;s nothing to see here she says oh it they were FAA approved they were research drones yeah see that begs a question if you were given orders by the president who told you we will clear this up immediately cuz he was asked this as soon as he was elected he goes what happened there we have to figure that out and he like orders somebody to figure it out so those were your orders you&#x27;re saying we have FAA research drones what were they researching if it&#x27;s a prosaic easy thing to explain away you say it how come no one that if it&#x27;s not if it is not then you don&#x27;t say it so I think it points to some more exotic answers again I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know you have to think probabilistically about all this stuff and I&#x27;d be open to it not being you but like I think there&#x27;s a lot of evidence also Southport New Brunswick Duke Energy plant there was UFOs showing up there too so like so so drones or UFOs UFOs meaning what what do they look like they look more like these plasma orb style things yeah like the bledo orbs more like the bledo orbs like those look very different than these like fixed Wing like like they&#x27;re just different that&#x27;s why the whole thing&#x27;s it&#x27;s like not New Jersey and it&#x27;s not just drones yeah it&#x27;s a whole of stuff and and it&#x27;s again it you get into these weird kind of questions of like were they trying distract were they trying to run a simulation there&#x27;s so many like so many questions but also in the case in which it wasn&#x27;t our say say in the case in which there were real UFOs like not you know not ours not prosaically explained UFOs you would probably put some stuff out to research it you put some of our stuff out so it&#x27;s like really murky and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s way more charismatic and easy and goes viral much quicker to be like there&#x27;s a loose nuke on the Eastern Seaboard right that will go viral way faster than like it&#x27;s actually a whole host of things complicated not that yeah yeah yeah exactly so I think that&#x27;s kind of what happened and that&#x27;s why like the you know if there were scops around explaining things away I think it that&#x27;s why it was so charismatic but then you talk to like the nuclear you know support teams that the emergency teams Nest or whatever all of those guys were like no there&#x27;s nothing there like you know nobody was like being evacuated so clearly wasn&#x27;t so it&#x27;s weird dude with like all of this stuff that&#x27;s been happening lately with the news cycle and all the crazy things that have gone on in the last six months like from Trump almost getting killed on on live TV yeah to like a week later that story is completely dead and then we have like the Olympics debacle and then we have like the the debates the election and all this the New Jersey drones like there&#x27;s like so much stuff happening on top of the fact that people are more awake now than ever of all the [ __ ] that&#x27;s going on with like not only just the media trying to subvert stuff with advertisers but with the government trying to subvert stuff like people more aware of the word scop now than ever I&#x27;m sure if you I&#x27;m sure if you did a Google trend on that word scop it&#x27;s probably a skyrocketing the last year for sure so like I wonder if the government came out tomorrow and said Yes we made a deal deal with these alien civilization and they&#x27;re here we have their UFOs I wonder legitimately what percentage of people would believe that or just run the other way this is such an important thing you&#x27;re bringing up because all already with the Jake Barber piece the UFO world has cleaved off and is on another island of reality from M mainstream media has no idea who Jake Barber is unfortunately it sucks cuz it&#x27;s such an important story but like because it&#x27;s a hard pill to swallow we&#x27;re talking about psionics mind matter connection you know uh egg-shaped things showing up in our air like it&#x27;s a lot to stomach all at once and it breaks the brain of these Normy Legacy people who like aren&#x27;t down these rabbit holes that you and I are down because we&#x27;ve spoken to a lot of people and so it it&#x27;s this really important ontological question where it&#x27;s like people we need disclosure we need disclosure I&#x27;m like if you walked into a hanger and were shown a UFO you walked into the UFO it wouldn&#x27;t change your life at all you&#x27;d have no idea what you were looking at and it would beget all sorts of other questions that you&#x27;d have that wouldn&#x27;t be answered upon walking into the UFO or whatever so it&#x27;s disclosure isn&#x27;t some file that&#x27;s going to come out where it&#x27;s like this this this these are you know facts or whatever I do look I do think if Trump or Tulsi or like one of these people with like you know serious you know credentials in the government like cabinet level credentials or even from the past cabinet level credentials says there&#x27;s a there there I do think that&#x27;s like a step function up as far as disclosure like that&#x27;s that&#x27;s progress but it&#x27;s gonna be this it&#x27;s you&#x27;re you&#x27;re dealing with people&#x27;s core belief systems and it&#x27;s going to be this sort of um broken Jagged process it&#x27;s not going to be this like overnight like we have disclosure like it people in our world or you know I I don&#x27;t know where you lie but in a lot of my world or whatever they&#x27;re like we&#x27;ve had disclosure like so much has come out outside of 8K you know imagery with like the president standing next to a UFO it&#x27;s like we&#x27;ve kind of given a lot if they wanted to make it available if they wanted to do disclosure think about it they&#x27;re doing it the right way right no one&#x27;s losing their mind yeah religion is not burning to the ground people aren&#x27;t quitting their jobs and like shooting it&#x27;s not turning into Mad Max out there or like they they are doing it the right way although like kind of what I was alluding to is like with the distrust of media and government now and people being aware of the deception the Strategic deception that they are capable of Y if the government was to say yes there&#x27;s aliens we have them we have a we have a saucer right there would be a huge chunk of people who think automatically if they&#x27;re saying that the opposite must be true yeah of course of course and I and I I understand that skepticism and I I have a reflexive allergic reaction to the government telling me anything as well and I would just say just because you think somebody has an ulterior motive because a lot of people in the yo world have a [ __ ] ulterior motive doesn&#x27;t mean everything they&#x27;re saying is wrong right maybe they&#x27;re doing some weird controlled opposition thing maybe they&#x27;re doing some thing where they want to make money and inherit some equities outside of the government maybe they&#x27;re like I can give you 50 million reasons as to why somebody would say some [ __ ] about UFOs and you know claim to come from an authoritative background that aren&#x27;t pure that doesn&#x27;t mean the facts they&#x27;re saying are wrong and I think a you know a lot of these guy like I think the the the the the primacia stories of a lot of these guys are just fully right they&#x27;re just correct and people just can&#x27;t stomach them they can&#x27;t they&#x27;re like this just breaks their brain it breaks their priors and uh yeah it&#x27;s tough and it&#x27;s that&#x27;s why you think mainstream media hasn&#x27;t reported on Jake story yeah I think it breaks I think they don&#x27;t know how to process it I think they have no idea how to the computer it like breaks their computer I mean dude those guys are mind controlled I mean like in those guys want money though they want that&#x27;s true they do want money but they also you know have certain commercial interests and like are you know uh connected to like various I mean you&#x27;re seeing what&#x27;s happening with Mike you know Mike Ben is reporting on all this like USA like you know back Channel [ __ ] with like every Legacy Media I am so shocked that YouTube&#x27;s letting that [ __ ] go it&#x27;s wild it&#x27;s wild that they&#x27;re letting it go but I think we&#x27;ve crossed the Rubicon of sorts but like I hope so we don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s making calls at these Studios but look at like covid like for a year I mean even in like I think 2022 the New York Times published a steel Manning of the like zuntic origin of Co story it&#x27;s like give it up guys it&#x27;s so stupid like you literally have to it takes the probabilistic thinking of a child to realize they&#x27;re wet markets all over China why was it the one wet Market six miles next to the W Institute of biology which is studying Spike proteins added on to like a basically modification of SARS and how they can create a pandemic like give me a break like there&#x27;s an outbreak of chocolatey goodness in Hershey Pennsylvania John John Stewart said it hilarious and that just get so simple right but they don&#x27;t they&#x27;re it they&#x27;re overeducated they&#x27;ve lost their Instinct they don&#x27;t actually think of about any media story critically at all they&#x27;re I hate to say I come from this world I went to Columbia and like I you know I know a lot of these people I love them they think I&#x27;m crazy now or whatever but they don&#x27;t actually do thinking around like like they hear a story and they they&#x27;re they ideas are fashion statements and they don&#x27;t want to look bad at the water cooler you know at con Nast or wherever they are you know they don&#x27;t want to like they and they&#x27;re snarky and if you watch you know I used to in I interned for uh you know The Daily Show back in the day and like I I I thought they were yeah that&#x27;s crazy I John Stewart was a total uh Bull workk against neoconservatism back in the day that was very healthy and like amazing and now he&#x27;s just out of they&#x27;re out of touch man like like you have you know these correspondents go out these like Maga rallies and they just like make fun of them and like they&#x27;re snarky and look I was probably guilty of I was anti-trump in 2016 and like I you know I thought he was kind of crazy and like I was the same way you know I was like these these these states don&#x27;t these red states don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s good for them like you know and then you my now belief is like the more like you go through like the liberal arts like ivy league education the more you lose touch with your real instincts about reality and your your your worldview and like mental models on things are actually like really wrong you&#x27;re like way off and it&#x27;s couched in this veneer of sophistry and of sophistication and so it sounds really smart but it&#x27;s actually really stupid and it&#x27;s wrong I try I try my hardest to be open-minded about things and look at things from multiple angles but like every single big topic like UFOs or ancient Graham Hancock&#x27;s a big one yeah yeah he&#x27;s like a he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s like no well no they [ __ ] love him well it&#x27;s either one or the other he&#x27;s so polarizing it&#x27;s so polarizing and the lack of open-mindedness and an an ability to form independent thoughts outside of the comment B is astonishing yeah no it&#x27;s it&#x27;s crazy and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an ageold Trope in history of this amateur gentleman journeyer who has correct instincts is outside of the Priestly Citadel of experts and then gets proven right Hinrich schiman was this German businessman that was laughed at forever because he thought the ancient city of Troy you know in the pelian War written about by Homer and Theus cities was actually you know that wasn&#x27;t mythology like that was actually real place and then he goes out and he finds it and the 1870s and we now have tons of corroboration that&#x27;s now consensus Luis Walter Alvarez thought that you know an asteroid impact took out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago and in their case they actually were extremely credential Luis Walter Alvarez the father was uh you know in the Manhattan Project very involved with Oppenheimer and so but he was this like you know he was out of his domain right it he was an archaeologist but he was right right and now now you have Graham Hancock and Randle Carlson they&#x27;re saying the same thing about younger drag impact younger D impact they&#x27;re also pointing to mythology just like uh Hinrich Von schan did in the case of Plato and dates around Plato but they also have tons of archaeological evidence like great archaeological evidence that uh there was an air burst from the torid meteor stream around that time and they&#x27;re just not being taken seriously and my money&#x27;s on them my money&#x27;s not on the The Citadel so it&#x27;s yeah it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s reflexive bad thinking and any there&#x27;s a great book um by this guy Sam arbisman it&#x27;s called the halflife of facts and at any point in history we were wrong about 50% of the like conventional wisdom at the time like or roughly right okay like so we&#x27;re probably wrong about 50% of what we know now yeah so if you are going around being this like Michael shurmer style or Richard Dawkins style skeptic Neil degrass Tyson like we know everything you&#x27;re you you are being ahistorical you&#x27;re engaging in thinking unless you can point to some percentage of current knowledge that you think is wrong you are a you&#x27;re like a me an extension of the Borg you&#x27;re like you were the thought police for the conventional wisdom and you&#x27;re probably wrong so yeah I I just I I like to systematically go through the anomalies because I think that there tells on what the next scientific paradigms are like if you look at you know black body radiation uh was discovered by this German guy in the 1860s we couldn&#x27;t that was the you know the fact that that would create this ultraviolet catastrophe it was this guy Gustaf kop we couldn&#x27;t understand that until Max plank in the quantum revolution in the 1900s the Mercury the the the orbit of mercury wasn&#x27;t understood in the Newtonian context and we needed general relativity to explain it so when you see an anomaly like a UFO or like you know uh a scab you know Washington scablands like you know impacts or whatever that you know you might represent you know the the you system look at the anomalies you can&#x27;t IGN them because they to new scient this is scientific revolutions 101 Thomas [ __ ] wrote about this in the structure of scientific revolutions the anomalies bring in the new paradigm yeah so what I think you&#x27;re doing and what I love to do is like talk to people on the fringes and just because you&#x27;re talking to them doesn&#x27;t mean you agree with everything they say you&#x27;re not platform we have the benefit of talking to the people on the fringes and the people in the center of the academic institutions totally totally which they each one to you know some of them the people in the academic institutions are most are in a bubble they&#x27;re not talking to the people in The Fringe every day and same thing most of the time with people on the fringes and like the way I explain like the whole Flint dible Graham Hancock thing is like I completely understand how Flint Dibble who his dad named him Flint because he&#x27;s an archaeologist and his dad&#x27;s probably an archaeologist who spent his whole life studying archaeology reading the boring books doing the boring [ __ ] traveling all over digging through the mud and pulling stuff out his whole life and nobody knows who the [ __ ] you are y then Graham Hancock comes along writes some crazy [ __ ] book and becomes a super celebrity and makes tons of money going on Joe Rogan all the time I&#x27;m gonna be I&#x27;m gonna be super jealous and resentful of that guy too 100% I&#x27;m not going to go as far Flint Dibble did make that very clear I mean some of the [ __ ] he did was really terrible in my opinion and he was like lying about he was the some certain slides were up on that Rogan episode that were just like wrong and not only that but like and this is a super unpopular opinion and I will get completely destroyed in the comments for saying this but I think Flint killed him on that debate oh Hancock without having the ability of have being able to Monday Morning Quarterback and see okay he was wrong about a lot of stuff because he did do some dishonest things by like he was very confident and saying things that were quite literally wrong after people were able to go back and review the stuff and Graham was actually able to go back over the podcast and out like okay like you&#x27;re completely wrong about the number of ships or any of this other stuff that you were talking about but like but like I learned a fuckload from Flint during that podcast he was able to fill in the gaps of stuff that Graham didn&#x27;t really understand during that podcast I feel like and I feel like even Rogan during that podcast was siding with Flint on things like he was like Graham don&#x27;t you think that looks like that looks kind of natural to me was like no no no no no no anyways that&#x27;s neither here nor there I I think that like I thought he did a great job but what I don&#x27;t like is how he went on Twitter afterwards and like oh do you see how much I kick Graham&#x27;s ass during that podcast sub tweeting every tweet that Graham did looking like a complete douchebag totally yeah but like so I guess my point is like I understand I understand how Flint feels the why he feels the way he feels yeah right and why people in Academia feel the the way um the way Flint feels and I see how there&#x27;s sort of like a rift between these two groups and just like combine that with the way modern media works like podcasting is the number one form of information in the world now right and like people are more interested in the Fring stuff because it&#x27;s exciting Y and it&#x27;s more Sensational and um I think you know long way of putting it but you know Academia academics get resentful of that and it&#x27;s created this sort of like this dichotomy if you will totally totally and and I but I think there&#x27;s value in it to your point with Flint dble where it&#x27;s like you need to stress test the really bold Grand new ideas and theories and uh yeah I think science is a process it&#x27;s like you know you have skepticism and dogmatism and it&#x27;s a inbus and you want you want you know you want both and I think having debates like that are really good but I&#x27;m always partial or sympathetic to quote unquote platforming the people with the Bold Grand ideas where like some of the stuff might be wrong semantically yeah but they&#x27;re directionally correct on like in like a big way that&#x27;s exciting versus these guys that are just defending the modern Paradigm cuz I don&#x27;t think that gets us anywhere like yeah like I agree like Darwin is like a locally useful Theory like I don&#x27;t like I wouldn&#x27;t I don&#x27;t think like Darwin fake it&#x27;s a theory and I think gravity is also a theory gravity is also a theory totally and but I think it&#x27;s also useful in a scientific you know I don&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t like throw it out at all like these things are like extremely useful gravity is a great example because there are like many anomalies with it both on a macroscopic you know level with with dark matter and on a microscopic level you know with you know um it&#x27;s irreconcilable with the other you know forces on a Quantum level um and you know electrons don&#x27;t exhibit gravity you know in the same in the same way you know other you know objects do super wild [ __ ] it&#x27;s interesting yeah yeah um so yeah I I don&#x27;t know I think I I I&#x27;m always partial to Let&#x27;s like systematically talk to the people with the Bold theories and then stress test and come at them and try to you know uh uh uh uh negate any parts of their thinking that are kind of flimsy right but like you know really take seriously their their ideas especially when they&#x27;re driven I think the difference between Dibble and Graham Hancock is like one is driven more by intuition and this like life purpose Mission thing and in our modern day that&#x27;s seen as inherently BS or something whereas the other person&#x27;s like like came up through the system and like that&#x27;s just seen as more valid and I would say if you&#x27;re like you feel like hermetically called to a thing you&#x27;re going to be extremely motivated you&#x27;re going to find out all sorts of stuff and he had I mean we would not be talking about gockley Tey if it weren&#x27;t for Graham hanc exact and so we the conventional wisdom on like how old civilization is would be the you know classic Mesopotamia was the cradle of civilization so like who&#x27;s who&#x27;s had more of an impact just based on that 100% that&#x27;s Graham Hancock even Flint said when he was in here he goes Graham inspired a lot of people that I know that are now academic archaeologists and devoted their career to this stuff there you go so you know totally so yeah again and I don&#x27;t even know like I don&#x27;t even know what the actual objective was of that debate other than to like disprove Graham&#x27;s ancient civilization idea debates like this are tough yeah because like often it&#x27;s like like I I I did did like this informal debate with like Michael Shermer I saw that and like who was the guy that he debated who uh Michael Shermer you&#x27;re Michael shmer and who no I uh it was just me and him oh no but I saw one on your Channel with oh no no Mick that was Mick and that that was that was a tough one too where it&#x27;s just you have the Skeptics who I think do provide this service and I even came out thinking okay like Mick actually you know has some interesting debunks in these certain areas I&#x27;m going to like hold certain of some of these videos in lower probability like actually one of my takeaways is like video evidence isn&#x27;t the kind of Archimedes lever for disclosure in general like it&#x27;s not the thing you want to hinge your belief on at all cuz like they&#x27;re all kind of murky and like not great um although I think maybe on the margins won the debate but yeah I think the the classic thing with like skeptic versus Pro when it comes to these really kind of hard to answer questions is like the pro people have all these reasons as to like why you know it&#x27;s anomalous and then the anti people they just they sit on these kind of like oh it&#x27;s law of large numbers or it&#x27;s aam&#x27;s Razer or it&#x27;s that you know it&#x27;s like these like rules of thumb that like are just it&#x27;s like kind of lame and like provocative and like you&#x27;re not actually looking at the like finally I think mck West has read UFOs and nukes by Robert Hastings CU it&#x27;s such an important data set when it comes to UFOs but can&#x27;t say anything there&#x27;s nothing he can say because he it&#x27;s like how are how are you GNA go at these guy you can&#x27;t go out their credentials you going to say call them Liars like they&#x27;re on the PRP program it&#x27;s kind of hard so like you end up with these this like two trains passing in the night in the debates where it&#x27;s like one side has a data set and the other side just won&#x27;t agree that the set is legitimate they&#x27;re just like it&#x27;s survivorship bias it&#x27;s file drawer issues it&#x27;s you&#x27;re a liar you&#x27;re a grifter or whatever but like look at the data look at what do you mean like I&#x27;ve met a lot of these guys who&#x27;ve seen the stuff at nuclear sites and it&#x27;s like some of them have maintained Q clearances for years after they&#x27;ve seen the stuff like and then at that point it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know what to tell you if you&#x27;re not going to like believe you know if you&#x27;re not going to like read the book which is a 580 page book extremely dry and it&#x27;s almost boring really because it&#x27;s so r and good and meticulously done like Robert Hastings has like an tic memory and so like you&#x27;re either going to read the book and like engage with it or you&#x27;re not and if you&#x27;re not then like I don&#x27;t know what the debate is about right what do you make of Elon not being impressed or not being interested in this stuff I find it really interesting um you know starlink is just like an optical uh uh group of you know satellites and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the the biggest you know Optical you know group but and then obviously RF communic seen videos of all the satellites that we have surrounding the earth it&#x27;s insane yeah it&#x27;s crazy especially starlink is just blowing it out of the water I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s everywhere and they have they have um I think it&#x27;s star Shield is like the Dual use kind of you know Optical or whatever but so you hear that these things the UFOs are like picked up by like other sensor modalities I don&#x27;t know on Elon I like look in the world in which UFOs exist I would have to think he&#x27;s got to know some stuff you know like I just so I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s playing especially if these rocket guys like Tim are [ __ ] dedicating their like their lives to this stuff totally and they have any overlap okay the interesting thing I thought on Elon is he kind of too he walked back a couple of things recently in the last couple of months somebody said talk mentioned David grush to him and said like you know maybe we&#x27;re hiding all the secret Tech and he said well if we are hiding secret Tech I would hope that that would you know come out and so that was a change in tune that wasn&#x27;t this like you know joke oh I&#x27;m an alien or like I would know like it&#x27;s you know we don&#x27;t have high resolution imagery like he kind of walked that back in that in that you know um interview question yeah and then the second thing he said I think Tucker asked him about UFOs and he said I think it&#x27;s deep black American programs really at that point you&#x27;re kind of backing yourself into a corner where it&#x27;s really interesting like what are you saying man are you saying that we have deep black American programs that look like they&#x27;re breaking physics so like they break conservation momentum they fly mock you know 10 and then they stop on a dime and then they you know make right angle turns and then they go from you know uh right above the water to like above 880,000 ft like David fraver is saying and you know uh uh looks like they&#x27;re you know not using chemical combustion because if you are then you&#x27;re saying we have physics that&#x27;s in deep black compartments that you know well surpass what we&#x27;re doing with chemical combustion when it comes to starlink where you have these you know I don&#x27;t know 33 36 Raptor engines and it&#x27;s all just mass ejection and it&#x27;s all just you know Newton&#x27;s Laws yeah and so it&#x27;s you&#x27;re kind of backing yourself into a corner where it&#x27;s like we either have secret physics or you&#x27;re because you&#x27;re saying this stuff is real in that interview you&#x27;re saying the stuff is real or maybe there&#x27;s you could hang on like um that we have some you know really good like radar spoofing you know and like that would be your you know or Fleer spoofing or whatever you&#x27;d have you know yeah some some version of that maybe you could do Holograms and Optical spoofy I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what he would say but it&#x27;s weird it&#x27;s such a mind [ __ ] because I think if I can think of anyone who would be more interested who should be interested in stuff I would think of him I no I&#x27;m with you it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a strange it feels like you know like there&#x27;s like dark matter in physics it&#x27;s like what&#x27;s the Dark Matter there like like like we can&#x27;t detect something going on there and I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what it is oh that&#x27;s so true man that&#x27;s so true um I got to take a leak go take a Le let&#x27;s take a quick break yeah let&#x27;s do it cool all right we&#x27;re back from our PP break yes um yeah the Elon stuff is crazy so I wanted I did want to ask you um yeah how did you find this guy Jake Barber and I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this guy can can you explain how you met him and then how like what happened with him and where he came from like his story yeah so he was originally like a red team guy who was well he was on the program what does that mean um that means he was like meant to infiltrate like like adversary groups okay and stuff and so like he and he was like you know it&#x27;s basically like security for the program so he was part of the C crash retrieval program he was pipelined through Air Force combat control which is a special uh the Air Force version of Special Forces he didn&#x27;t become Air Force Special Forces at that point he became kind of sheep dipped if you know that term in like Intel circles or whatever like erased like he became like you know director of uh operations for a helicopter company and you know that was basically his title okay um but he was working with these you know Prime contractors you might be able to guess who they are he doesn&#x27;t reveal who they are exactly but he he he so he says he was working for these secret Aerospace contract Aerospace contractors Aerospace contractors and I would imagine he&#x27;s talking about companies that are are like or similar to Batel or any of these other ones like locked or something like that yeah I don&#x27;t know you could guess he he he didn&#x27;t say he said he said if you tried to guess two you&#x27;d probably get them right on your first try so I might have got those two right maybe maybe um and so he&#x27;s doing retrieval operations for them and then on behalf of his employ laer he goes to Red Team Steven Greer Steven Greer was the we were just talking about this he was like the go-to guy for like any whistleblower in the government like he was the guy the disclosure project was for the last 20 years so he was trying to subvert Steven Greer&#x27;s whist try subvert and then 2023 um Stephen Greer held his like disclosure you know uh Congress thing or whatever and he had done a version of this two decades prior in 2001 I think and it was with a lot of really impressive amazing whistleblowers and it unfortunately it&#x27;s kind of couched under the veneer of Steven Greer who has you know certain issues yeah personality everybody I mean every single respectable person in the UFO World um they all detest step Greer he can I don&#x27;t know why I mean I can I mean I can I can I can imagine why but I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s like any kind of like like solid reason why they don&#x27;t like him I don&#x27;t know the guy personally and I&#x27;ve been trying to interview him for like a year through various goet and it&#x27;s I&#x27;ve got a lot of like weird resp like ego and responses I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know what the deal is So for anybody watching like oh thanks man appreciate it that&#x27;d be awesome yeah um I&#x27;ll trade you for grush that&#x27;s not a fair trade bro I need somebody else that&#x27;s so funny um so like we&#x27;re trading them Le UFO people like Pokemon cards yeah yeah yeah exactly I got to write you it&#x27;s yeah is like in the Pokemon what would he be is he like a don&#x27;t say it I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not I know like there&#x27;s Collectibles you got to catch them all but like what which one would Greer be would he be the Charizard or what maybe it might be Charizard I don&#x27;t know okay what&#x27;s the big one that would Puff out all that stinky gas what&#x27;s the most what&#x27;s the most valuable Pokemon Charizard right it&#x27;s Mewtwo Mewtwo no Mew is even more valuable than Mewtwo Mewtwo and then Mew is like the baby Mewtwo I think oh okay I don&#x27;t know all yeah you go if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re collecting these guys you got to have you got to have Greer on your belt yeah I I know like you explain that to me right he&#x27;s one of he&#x27;s one of the most legendary like like OG UFO people you said he was like in the 90s he was the only guy he was like the only guy I mean that&#x27;s not that&#x27;s actually an important thing to correct he was the only very public facing guy and that&#x27;s why he became who he is now MH but I think he took a lot of his stuff from a guy named uh Bill Hamilton William Hamilton who would write about these deep underground military bases covert operations and there was a lot of actually hard-headed research going on at the time and he kind of shorted it up and made it this more public thing it was interest it&#x27;s an interesting origin story because I don&#x27;t quite understand how he went from he was a physician and he says he was n doctor he was n doctor and then he got super into UFOs he said during one of his C5 things um there was a an Air Force spook or something there and saw the stuff he was doing and told the CIA guy the head of the CIA who then want wanted to go to dinner with him yeah I it&#x27;s super interesting I mean and again I believe the Jake Barber account and like it kind of comports with that where it involves like trying to call stuff in which is so at that time you have this guy Albert stubblebine who also has connections with remote viewing at the time and John Alexander who&#x27;s this longtime kind of UFO historian but he also debunks certain things and he deep government also close to with bledo and inserts himself in like all sorts of interesting C like John Hutchinson was this guy who would claimed to like have mind matter effects with like these like metallic instruments around him and in California and John Alexander shows up there John Alexander is this very interesting figure in UFO world where he just pops in like you know at very opportune times um so stubblebine career claims he offered him $2 billion to participate in the Legacy UFO or Oh I thought the side I thought it was like join come join our UFO program or something it was okay interesting he explained it to me like it was part of the offered him $2 billion to basically be a part of their building the public narrative or something okay interesting interesting well that yeah sounds like Yes sounds right I mean I like I actually I think there&#x27;s an email showing that maybe but I but I I don&#x27;t think the offer was real I I mean stubble B&#x27;s this weird character he&#x27;s Army counter Intel and he&#x27;s also on record touting all sorts of other bizarre conspiracies he&#x27;s one of these people who just subbin yeah yeah and so it&#x27;s one of these people who just don&#x27;t know what to make of him um but they do insert themselves in Greer&#x27;s life and then Greer becomes the deao guy where if you&#x27;re on the inside you&#x27;re working at locked or northrip or you know you&#x27;re a CIA contractor or whatever you see some [ __ ] and you want the public to know you go to Greer and so the dislo disclosure project archives are to this day probably like among the best UFO databases Treasure troves of pretty interesting contemporary information and so I you can&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bath water as much as uh he&#x27;s a very interesting kind of strange character there&#x27;s some ego there he&#x27;s easy to dismiss for sure yeah and there&#x27;s definitely some Messianic VI like it feels like he&#x27;s you know he&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s bringing the thing it&#x27;s like come on dude it&#x27;s it&#x27;s everybody you know yeah it is most people yeah and this you know it&#x27;s just like there&#x27;s also like a thing when somebody H you know has all the answers to every thing yep yep you know there&#x27;s a weird thing that happens there too yep but um what were we talking oh we were talking about Jake Barber so so Greer um Greer was hosting this thing uh where he had all these whistleblowers he was providing an outlet for these whistleblowers to come out and um you were saying that Jake barber went there to try to red team red team meaning what infiltrate Greer and trying to like like like bust one of these guys for blowing the whistle bust the whole organization maybe infiltrate the organization and then become you know like the guy from Legacy who&#x27;s feeding info back into Legacy UFO programs from like you know this important kind of vulnerability Threat Vector or whatever yeah and so he&#x27;s at this Congress or whatever and you know his story is that Michael Herrera do you know who that is yeah he&#x27;s a Marine who was in the Philippines and he gets diverted with his unit of I think like eight or nine people to Indonesia and Indonesia is a disaster Zone it&#x27;s due to this earthquake there&#x27;s a tsunami warning and so everybody&#x27;s evacuating the area and his Marines he and his Marines are apprehended first he sees an eight gon like an octagon shaped craft hovering above the Treetops that he says is vanta black and it&#x27;s like he calls it blacker than black and it&#x27;s above the Treetops and he starts to close in on that craft with his Marines cuz they&#x27;re like what the hell&#x27;s going on here and then they get apprehended by this Elite param military unit which in like I think it was 2009 like they had like bioc scanners and like all sorts of gear you would never expect that they like they were clearly and they were very well trained probably tier one special forces and we kind of running circles around these marines saying stuff like it&#x27;s easy to get lost in the woods or it&#x27;s easy to get lost in the jungle you know like well you know uh did these guys say they were part of any any specific branch of the military or were they do they have any like badging on them or they had it was completely nondescript but very Advanced according to Herrera and so private yeah maybe yeah and they were loading these crates onto this flatbed this truck it was like an Ford F250 or something and uh he was like I don&#x27;t know what the crates were or whatever and so Barber he&#x27;s at this disclosure event where Herrera is giving this account and Herrera also gets interviewed by Shawn Ryan as well and barber is like I could see the authenticity in Herrera and I you know what am I doing here sort of thing and there are other reasons I guess Barber felt like he was betrayed by his you know contractor uh in the past and at that moment he goes like [ __ ] this I&#x27;m going to like red team the red team or I&#x27;m going to like red team you know the the I&#x27;m gonna I&#x27;m going to talk to these guys earnestly I&#x27;m going to side up with you know the herreras of the world and try to see if we can get you know some of these truths out um and so he back CH he talks to Herrera and he says that the crates actually had people in them in Indonesia and that these crates were bringing back these psionic assets that are used for the UFO program to attract UFOs and so it&#x27;s this crazy story psionic assets meaning like 11 from stranger things they&#x27;re trying to find girls like or like young children I don&#x27;t people that had superpowers I don&#x27;t know what age again there are stories that like really match stranger things as far as the ages of the people being recruited into the programs and that gets into some weird weird [ __ ] um and so I don&#x27;t know what age these people were because they were in these like metallic containers and they were being evacuated from the area I mean even the fact that they&#x27;re being kept in the metallic containers is weird right like it&#x27;s also said there was uh they were trying to get homosexual people that&#x27;s apparently this thing apparently uh uh gay men and uh left people who are left hand and again this is something I just I have no idea if that&#x27;s how true that is but that&#x27;s I&#x27;m just trying to I&#x27;m trying to like think through the logistics of that you&#x27;re in a earthquake zone where there was a crazy natural disaster people are like they&#x27;re I don&#x27;t know if they speak English right or they the other guys speak IND Indonesian right but like were they like raise your hand if you&#x27;re a homosexual or like are you left-handed or right-handed like how are you doing this are you just bulk Gathering these people and then figuring it out later I don&#x27;t know and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s there&#x27;s another question question is like were they engaging in operations and did they have to evacuate because of the tsunami or were they take and this is the way Herrera presents it on Shan Ryan which is more nefarious honestly where it&#x27;s like are you taking advantage of the fact that there&#x27;s a disaster Zone and people could go missing yeah and taking them back with you which is like weird of course they would be why wouldn&#x27;t they be well it&#x27;s a question of like were those people already like willfully signed up for the program they were attracting stuff in the jungle of Indonesia that&#x27;s why the the the Black Craft was there I guess the Black Craft I think was human so so I take that back but like maybe that was part of the operation but like so yeah they were like engaging in oper field operations there or was were you just the operation itself was to round up these people who were lost that&#x27;s the impression that I got was that I mean just from watching your podcast the impression I got was that they saw there was a disaster there and thought this would be an opportunity to extract some people can use so I want to talk to Herrera and I I want to get to the bottom of it um he says that on the Shan Ryan podcast yeah but Barber says on my podcast or they were engaging in operations and they had to get the hell out of Dodge because this tsunami was coming so Barbara also seemed very off-put about Shawn Ryan and Herrera saying that that they were just going there to exploit the the disaster and get those people out he seemed kind of like right he&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t like Des Shawn Ryan even used the word human trafficking right offended by it almost right yeah so yeah I I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know the the the kind of ground truth on that but so so he&#x27;s saying that there PE that these people are being taken from this place in Indonesia and my assessment my guess is that like these people are are more in tune to Nature they&#x27;re not around technology and civilization so Jake said that they he said that on your podcast maybe they have a different diet they&#x27;re not eating processed garbage so that would automatically give them let them be tapped into this Muse or this consciousness or whatever it is well that&#x27;s what they say in the US too like you know you have Dolce you know New Mexico you have Tacoma Washington you have Skinwalker Ranch all of these are ancient Native American lands and apparently that&#x27;s where a lot of this kind of weird stuff shows up Skinwalker rench we know is professionally you know as part of UFO research efforts investigated as part of assap from 2007 to 2012 and so I I think both like the people um are like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s just like you know if you go to like you know most indigenous tribes you talk about people from the Stars you&#x27;re not going to freak them out like they&#x27;re going to be kind of familiar with those Concepts like yeah we they come down during our ceremonies you know um it&#x27;s both I think the for the people it&#x27;s like they have less of like an allergic reaction because they haven&#x27;t been indoctrinated with this materialist reductionist Western Paradigm where we even need the idea of disclosure like for them it&#x27;s like second nature or whatever yes exactly and um and then also the land itself which then you&#x27;re getting into like trippier territory as to is there a residue on the places themselves that where like more kind of strange stuff goes on like I I would say yes like I think a lot of the stuff that goes on at Skinwalker Ranch is genuinely not you know we need to explain it via science but it&#x27;s weird it&#x27;s definitely weird like I don&#x27;t think that that show you know the secrets of Skinwalker Ranch yeah might be like you know you know the the the noise effects probably do it a diss surface and you got that kind of History Channel thing but like yeah it&#x27;s produced it&#x27;s produced but like I I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re lying about a lot of that stuff and if you again if you just investigate the you know first principles like what&#x27;s happening there it&#x27;s pretty weird it&#x27;s pretty weird it is so the cattle mutilation thing though that they talk about on mirag man yeah is fascinating yeah what&#x27;s your take there oh I mean it just seems like a perfect distraction or just a scop right I mean but it was all well they it seemed like an unintended scop that worked perfect for them right because I guess there was some sort of they were trying to prospect for oil I think it was there was a company that was trying to find oil by detonating an underground nuclear bomb uhhuh and they were trying to test the local Agriculture and Wildlife to see if how far the contamination went in the soil y so they were trying to find like they were extracting the glands of these cows to see if they had been affected by this radiation or whatever see if there was contamination and that happened to be the same place that they were flying this crazy exotic stuff and so the people were like oh my God we&#x27;re seeing UFOs and these cows are looking like this like it must be it must be them doing this so it&#x27;s like now okay that&#x27;s the perfect place to keep doing these test flies you know what I mean sure sure yeah yeah but that that was super interesting to to learn about that and to see how like you know just just like two operations Collide and end up being the perfect [ __ ] mind [ __ ] for the public to like sure don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on 100% 100% no and that movie is super important to realize how sophisticated a lot of the scops can be in in in this like you can you know write scripts and back rooms and like make everything kind of weave together and fit but like the the a could you know be a data point B could be a data point that could be look completely uncorrelated but like you&#x27;re the source of both or whatever you know and like that&#x27;s definitely a thing you have to look out for in this world for sure going back to Barber uh he was saying that there was a secret place where they were trying to use these people that they captured and give them drugs and get them to yep summon these UFOs yeah stress inoculation and dissociation andg like weird yeah and I think people who&#x27;ve had trauma in their past I guess are predisposed all of this is seems a little was saying it was dopaminergic drugs that they were giving him yeah that might make sense yeah yeah I mean I again this is not based on firsthand knowledge so I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know this is this all like super super speculative but I also like so I&#x27;m in the camp where I believe the summoning stuff is very real and very dangerous and I the I I I feel pretty like you know like I think Jake Barber&#x27;s story is like pretty beyond reproach actually on the like surface level details of it and then where by that what do you mean is beyond rep like you think it&#x27;s super legit I think it&#x27;s super legit yeah I do um where I get worried about what might be an after effect is this idea of like summoning things into your purview I think that stuff&#x27;s really real and I think it&#x27;s dangerous I don&#x27;t think uh it&#x27;s for the you know I think you have to have very pure intentions and I think if you show up in certain places and you you try to you know do these things I I think that&#x27;s it&#x27;s very it&#x27;s very could end very bad Sly for for people uh so and I think it&#x27;s the reason you have all this stuff at Skinwalker Ranch where like often it&#x27;s guys with big egos or whatever it&#x27;s like they have the story of this like Hell&#x27;s Angels Chieftain who like you know uh uh goes there and he&#x27;s like put into a catatonic State like on the Mesa or whatever and then he has to go he&#x27;s in the hospital for three weeks after that and uh so I think it&#x27;s I think it&#x27;s kind of dangerous to to do some of this stuff if you&#x27;re not doing it safely and and and and honestly with it just pure intention what&#x27;s the danger I don&#x27;t you know have you uh you&#x27;ve had Dana Pula on right yeah okay so like you remember the story with St Francis of Ai No so okay so he&#x27;s this you know um he&#x27;s actually kind of grows up like kind of this popular Guy and um you know he&#x27;s kind of you know life of the party kind of guy and then uh you know he he becomes a brother and I think he&#x27;s you know in a in a monastery and he starts to become more religious and he&#x27;s on Mount lever he&#x27;s hiking with his Confidant brother Leo who like records all the stuff that happens to him and uh he basically has a an encounter with an Angel and the angel Burns him and basically you know oh I remember this now it gives him you know what he calls this he say says it&#x27;s like a vision of Christ but if you actually go back to the original translation which Pula did it&#x27;s a flaming torch and what language was it uh remember Orek no it must have been uh uh Latin oh Latin yeah I think so medieval yeah yeah probably Latin okay um so St Francis of his CC was when like uh in medieval times uh 13th century I think 13th okay yeah um so like the subplot of the whole thing with St Francis viisi is like he has basically electromagnetic radiation damage and he calls it the Stigmata and he says div vision of Christ but like it&#x27;s probably what you would say is just electromagnetic radiation now and he died from this stuff and if you look at the files given to Gary Nolan on people who&#x27;ve had you know paranormal you know basically encounters with UFOs and with you know alien beings it&#x27;s often electromagnetic damage and you know ultraviolet Burns and you you you know I I think some of these truths have been disseminated through fiction if you watch close CS of the Third Kind the guy is a sunburn after he sees a UFO and I think Steven Spielberg definitely has some spooky sources um and he has across the years and so I think calling these things into to your I think there are two things that attract this stuff nuclear and and certain States Of Consciousness and uh the ladder is going to you know give a lot of people you know an allergic reaction if you&#x27;re coming from kind of like a uh you know more Western materialist reductionist you know uh Academia you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re coming from but I do believe that&#x27;s that&#x27;s part of it and um calling these things into your purview can be very dangerous allaha all the files that Nolan looked at and Allah what happened to you know St Francis of aisi and I think as with all this stuff there&#x27;s a left-hand path and there&#x27;s a right way to do it and the left-hand path is basically ult stuff it&#x27;s like trying to summon stuff and you&#x27;re going to get burned it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s a typical every myth whether it&#x27;s Lord of the Rings faou Prometheus it always ends badly we&#x27;ve seen this movie before if you want the secret knowledge and you don&#x27;t have the right you know pure intention in your heart you&#x27;re just going to get burned cuz what you see will be an excavation of what&#x27;s in inside of you I mean that so you&#x27;re saying that first of all when it comes to Gary Nolan he was looking at people who these people that he studied people that got injured and or died yep right after having radiation poisoning or something like this from these these things those people how were they getting in contact with these things were they summoning them I so that that&#x27;s a total Black Box I don&#x27;t know I have no idea but I just think coming into contact with them it&#x27;s like you know the legend I&#x27;m not saying the Arc of the Covenant is real but this is a good analogy it&#x27;s like you know the holiest of holies if you don&#x27;t go in with a pure heart it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to be bad for you I think dealing if you&#x27;re dealing with this other world um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to you know kind of uh see you from the inside and out and it&#x27;s going to be very bad for you if you it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a classic myth and I think and I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not just myth I think it&#x27;s very real I think we live inside of a cave basically and and that cave is our kind of perceptive epistemology and if you want to see something that&#x27;s outside of the cave you can ask for it and it can come and you&#x27;re going to get you know hit like a load of bricks if you ask with the wrong intention what you&#x27;re describing sounds a lot like a a psychedelic trip it it&#x27;s the exact it&#x27;s very similar because if you go into a psychedelic trip and you have a lot of ego going in you&#x27;re G to get smashed yeah it&#x27;s G and it&#x27;s G to excavate but it&#x27;s not necessarily bad for you it&#x27;ll excavate what&#x27;s inside of you often but it needs to be done in a way that like you can handle and honestly I don&#x27;t believe in Psych that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t believe in like I believe in like veterans who are like on their last legs who need to take like iban or like of course like you know or like you know mushrooms or whatever but like this like oh let&#x27;s just like you know willy-nilly do this recreationally that I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to be good at all the the the veil not it&#x27;s definitely not for every it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not we have the veil for a reason you don&#x27;t want to unveil everything all at once right and so I I do believe that we have a very limited scope we only see between 400 and 700 nanometers on the electromagnetic wave spectrum you know our decibel range that we hear is limited like the the idea that like there&#x27;s nothing outside of what we see is ridiculous and then you have people like Donald Hoffman cognitive psychologist showing that what we see are basically like icons of reality like they are categorizations of reality like you&#x27;re not seeing electromagnetic wavelengths you&#x27;re not seeing the waves themselves you are seeing this table right because you need to instantly categorize things so the idea that we are seeing ground reality is crazy and then the idea that physics is the end of history is also crazy like our Consciousness definitely plays a part in what we&#x27;re seeing you say you experience synchronicities all the time you&#x27;re basically admitting that your personal epistemology is out of Step with the Western materialist Dogma you&#x27;re admitting that and saying that and maybe you&#x27;re saying I don&#x27;t know it could be like P the pattern matching of my mind or whatever but if you like get down to it with most people they&#x27;re like yeah a bunch of [ __ ] happened to me that&#x27;s like Beyond chance and probability and there&#x27;s probably something with your Consciousness that affects the material world or whatever so I think it&#x27;s not Beyond The Pale to say like if you want to experience something paranormal you probably will if you like you know do certain things and doing that um in a reckless way is very bad um and doing that honestly it&#x27;s the whole issue I think with the UFO thing like the whole context of this conversation is around weaponization of this stuff yeah and in certain cases I I always like my rallying cry is like it&#x27;s actually bad for National Security because like I want the powers that be to let more out so that&#x27;s like I&#x27;ll say that right like it&#x27;s bad for National Security if the left hand isn&#x27;t talking to the right hand and like Russia and China have their own UFO programs and they&#x27;re like beating us but my motivation is not weaponizing these things like I just I I kind of want to like poke the bear a little so they like let more out because they are holding on to a lot of stuff but the whole the fact that all this whole conversation is couched in like how can we build weapons out of the like this like meta material that like is like Mana from Heaven is so perverse and [ __ ] and so like my whole goal like to the extent that I ever do anything in a capitalist context with the UFOs stuff it&#x27;s I want civil side infrastructure update in the our cities to make our lives better and I want more meaning in the world in people&#x27;s individual lives and if I can do that and have top cover from National Security people who are like yeah if you find something dual use we&#x27;ll take it to the back room and work on it fine I&#x27;m I&#x27;m cool with protecting the Free World and making sure we&#x27;re ahead of China and Russia but the whole idea that like people&#x27;s impetus into this topic like that the fact that they&#x27;re into it is to just like let&#x27;s weaponize this like immediately is so so [ __ ] like you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re dealing with it&#x27;s probably is Angels and Demons that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the whole reason that we have everything that we have is I mean the most absurd and mind-blowing Science and Technology that we have was literally created in the context of War like John Von noyman like you were saying the brain power of that [ __ ] yeah like was literally used and monopolized for war like they they I think I think it was him was I think he was the one that calculated the exact elevation that the fat man little boy nukes needed to be to cause the most civilian casualties like he he estimated the exact elevation they needed to detonate those at Jesus to kill the most people it&#x27;s death it&#x27;s death yeah it&#x27;s so yeah I didn&#x27;t even know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s crazy yeah that&#x27;s bril I mean in in Annie Jacobson&#x27;s Pentagon Brain book all about the history of DARPA [ __ ] wow dude one of the most insane books yeah it&#x27;s that&#x27;s an amazing book that&#x27;s one of my favorite books of all time she&#x27;s amazing what a like an epic chronicler of just love her man and her voice God voice she a great voice she like the best podcast voice the best voice the best voice she so seductive so funny yeah she&#x27;s awesome but yeah no I don&#x27;t know how I don&#x27;t like going to what you&#x27;re saying I don&#x27;t know how you break that out of that right like how do you break out of that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the way the world works right that&#x27;s the way the world works the the the the the main motivation for technological innovation is for super superpowers to maintain their power and to gain more power well I think I mean again this requires a predisposition to some pretty trip trippy kind of ontological worldviews but like I I think the veil is droing I think like we&#x27;re seeing more of this stuff now and it might be because we&#x27;re not being super responsible with our world we live in this multi-polar nuclear world then you&#x27;re right to the extent we have access to you know anything off the books and you know of celestial or or whatever we&#x27;re weaponizing it immediately and you know things are just not good on a global scale right now no so I think what we might be seeing is kind of intervention Allah the three body problem or UFOs and nukes with Robert Hastings where if you talk to any of these guys any of the ICBM security Personnel any of these people who you know firsthand Witnesses their first instinct is always they&#x27;re trying to tell us to like stop our way you know to like you know hang back and like not destroy ourselves so and then you can get into the Mike Masters things where it&#x27;s like you know is is it some future version of humanity that is coming back in time trying to protect sustain the existence of the human timeline because like we&#x27;re going to blow ourselves up yeah and who would care more than the future version of ourselves it&#x27;s like in Back to the Future where it&#x27;s like you know Marty goes back in time because he wants his parents you know to be together Y and what Mike says about that the pedomorphism Y thing thaten happens how our ancestors that when the adults look more like the children of our of our descendants is crazy and that&#x27;s like like all the depictions of the aliens look like children yeah that&#x27;s right so in 500,000 years fully grown adults are going to look more like the toddlers of today if you were to ask any conventional biologist like somebody who doesn&#x27;t believe in aliens what will Humanity look like in a few thousand years you&#x27;d say Okay humans are getting domesticated so we&#x27;re losing the melanin in our skin so it&#x27;s getting kind of more pale our brains are becoming selected for because of more white collar work so cranial size gets much bigger nose and ears they don&#x27;t matter so much because you know we&#x27;re not Hunter Gathering right we yes there is paedomorphosis there&#x27;s neony we retain the larval features like of like young people in our you know basically like your kids are going to look like what your ancestors look like in the future right a and and we&#x27;re becoming domesticated a dog is to a wolf what we will look like you know in the future is to us right and so so I think yeah and then if you look at like all the databases around UFO abductions over 50% in almost all cases are homed creatures so and then and then you think the the likelihood of evolutionary convergence on Zeta reticuli Proxima centuri of them looking like homed beings what are the chances their atmosphere their gravity their solar system everything like like were they water worlds I know most of the goldilock plets that we&#x27;ve discovered have been water worlds if I&#x27;m not mistaken so like if they evolved in a world that was mostly water yeah it wouldn&#x27;t look anything like us are they going to have a brain that sits directly on top of the head no you have 8 million species on Earth and you have like 20 upright homed you know and then you have like one like fig so you&#x27;re saying like a gray looks exactly like us it doesn&#x27;t make any sense that blew my mind the most out of that book as how rare we are yes as as a species Homo sapiens on planet Earth which is a a a planet that&#x27;s teeming with [ __ ] life yes and how few planets that we&#x27;ve discovered that are habitable of life and like what how much like he was basically saying it&#x27;s like we are 0.00001% of the species on this Earth so if you extrapolate that out into the universe and how many planets are able to inhabit life what&#x27;s the chance they&#x27;re going to look like us like like that accurate yeah yeah it seems almost like impossible yeah no it&#x27;s the the ex exactly it&#x27;s the likelihood and if you&#x27;re seeing a thing in your neighborhood it&#x27;s more likely to be related it&#x27;s think about like North Sentinel Island is off the coast of India they never get visited occasionally by missionaries and they&#x27;ll kill the missionaries and they probably think when people visit them like you know you&#x27;re just some white dude and you like show up there they&#x27;d be like you&#x27;re an alien because they don&#x27;t know the rest of the world exists but if you see a thing in your neighborhood and it looks like you it&#x27;s probably an extension of you it&#x27;s probably related to you that&#x27;s just kind of aam&#x27;s Razor yeah so and then we have 20 billion you know earthlike planets in the you know Milky Way galaxy so people love to say that but then you have over a trillion non- earthlike planets so again the likelihood that you are seeing a thing in your neighborhood that looks like you doesn&#x27;t only look like you looks like what you probably are going to look like in a certain amount of time from an conventional evolutionary biology perspective yeah it&#x27;s Pro I love the Mike Master&#x27;s thesis as a result of that where I think Mike where I would disagree with him or where I think he might might fall slightly short and he would probably admit this because he&#x27;s again he&#x27;s done amazing foundational work is like I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s us from the future I think we might be stuck in a Time bound reality where we&#x27;re subject to Zeno&#x27;s Arrow of time where we are kind of indelibly permanently moving forward in Zeno&#x27;s Arrow of time and they have some ability to do trans temporal stuff where they can time travel and so you get all all these weird questions of like if time travel is future is is possible at any point in the future which he&#x27;s saying it is right with his book because they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re coming back in time they wouldn&#x27;t be able to go back past when that time machine was created is that right that&#x27;s right then it&#x27;s always been inherently available if time travel is available at any point in the future it&#x27;s always been available inherently right so that means time travel would had have been figured out somewhere else in the in the in the universe yes that&#x27;s right and so then you get into these questions of like you have the Angels and Demons ontology and you have the T human future time travel to ontology I think a really valid you know use of like a think tank would be like how do those two things comport are these ascended humans that have trans temporal capabilities time travel capabilities um that are like the next step on the evolutionary chain and but they like saying future is kind of a misnomer because in their Paradigm time doesn&#x27;t even exist the way it exists in ours right so I don&#x27;t know you get into all sorts of like crazy rabbit Hol but what I love about that book is it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s very scientific goes through cases and it goes through data to the extent we have data unfortunately the data is kind of scanted but it goes through the data and it just makes a very compelling groundup argument for why time travel is involved and why they&#x27;re related to humans and not just you know dation Paradox thing is really interesting too like how he said I love the part where he&#x27;s talking about like if we sent some um Interstellar crew out into the universe to find another planet or whatever he&#x27;s like 20 years of their rocket time would be like a 100,000 years of our time here on Earth totally so by like so half like 20 years into their trip we we would have figured out technology on Earth to be able to blow past them and like he&#x27;s he&#x27;s like he&#x27;s like 20 years into their trip we&#x27;re going to have people from Earth passing them and they just left that morning with a belly full of breakfast and they&#x27;re like what the [ __ ] we wasted our entire lives on this like uhhuh that&#x27;s an interesting Paradox too oh it&#x27;s a fascinating one any of the pl whole Planet of the Apes that yeah it&#x27;s like the the time itself is very weird in general relativity you have time dilation which we just described the twin paradox all that stuff and then in Quantum stuff I don&#x27;t think we quite understand time we take it as like this formal Axiom in Schrodinger&#x27;s equation but it&#x27;s actually kind of really weird and like time and gravity are coupled in general relativity the closer you get to a gravitational Source Time slows and in Quantum stuff you can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t figure out gravity that&#x27;s this big field of quantum gravity which is turned into String Theory which was like we&#x27;ve never been able to solve for for Gravity we&#x27;ve never been able to you know um fully you know uh uh figured out I love that documentary you did too with Eric Weinstein and uh that was fun man like like string theory some limited hangout or something to basically distract yeah Eric makes that proposition goes I don&#x27;t know he goes if you were trying to limit the physics String Theory would be a pretty good way to do it which that&#x27;s gets Beyond me okay so like is string theory this like padded walls 2D version of the real physics that they have in the back room and it&#x27;s just this like initiation recruitment thing but it&#x27;s like less dangerous I don&#x27;t know if you can do that to that seems like maybe like Beyond human coordination abilities that it gets beyond my physics knowledge and Eric might be able to speak to that more in a more sophisticated way as to like why that might even be possible but crazy thing that he said that really that really resonated with me in that video was he was like look at the Civil War in 1860 and less than a human lifetime later we figured out the [ __ ] adom bomb yeah how to drop a atom bomb out of a plane in less than a hundred years less than 100 years less than 100 years I mean so like just the understanding of physics how that changes changes our world and our technology and our our civilization we were using muskets in dude from muskets to nukes to nukes and if you take the three body problem seriously where you have the firmy Paradox where it&#x27;s like can you explain the three body problem for people who might not these tarian aliens that like we&#x27;ve been in contact with it takes place actually originally in the cultural revolution in in China and you have all these like scientists getting kind of like stamped out or whatever and then you have modern scientists that are making contact with aliens and often it&#x27;s in these extremely Advanced science projects like particle accelerators at places like CERN and they&#x27;re getting all sorts of like interesting CS from the aliens and um the tric salarian aliens are like in touch with the government and they&#x27;re like you cannot tell the populace that we are in touch with you because it&#x27;s going to like kind of you know it&#x27;s going to tip off Mass hysteria so we have to like slowly infiltrate ourselves which is by the way very similar to Arthur C Clark&#x27;s amazing book childhood&#x27;s end and I think this idea that like an alien civilization is slowly incepting itself is very popular and actually probably a good answer to the you know fmy Paradox if you were incredibly sophisticated you wouldn&#x27;t show up as this foreign Invader hominid you would just incept yourself you&#x27;d create hybrids you do genetic experiment you do all sorts of stuff so what what what were we just talking about why did I bring up the three body problem do you remember I forgot um oh we talking about nusk muskets to nukes yeah to nukes so like if you take the three body problem like in the three body problem there&#x27;s this Dark Forest analogy and it&#x27;s like the the universe could be teaming with life and it could be adaptive from the perspective of an alien race to not show themselves to you because they&#x27;re worried that you&#x27;re going to kill them or like going to harm them and why would they care until you start creating nukes or like certain things to like maybe you reach a certain level of Consciousness maybe you create a nuke maybe a high energy physics and maybe it&#x27;s C people reaching certain levels of consciousness and then all of a sudden they make themselves known where it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re are living you you living in this time bound simulation and you&#x27;re poking at the edges of the simulation you can do it with Consciousness you can do it with high energy physics and you know here we are like trying to like you know guard guard the simulation um and like make sure you&#x27;re not going to like mess anything up in a big way um and so I I think that&#x27;s actually a very good answer to the firmy Paradox it&#x27;s like why don&#x27;t they show themselves well there it&#x27;s actually like probably evolutionarily adaptive for them to not show themselves it like makes more sense that they wouldn&#x27;t in many ways yes yes yeah that does make a lot of sense so you think what what what are what are your thoughts on on the whole String Theory thing do you think that it&#x27;s like I know I know Eric&#x27;s like gone off the rails with it he says meaku how to control you talked to meaku yeah yeah I I&#x27;m on Eric&#x27;s side like I think clearly it doesn&#x27;t work and like it doesn&#x27;t take Eric or any physicist like you or me can say it doesn&#x27;t work it like name me like a piece of technology that&#x27;s come from String Theory right can&#x27;t name anything unfortunately name me something that&#x27;s come from Quantum field Theory like semiconductors like a third of our economy Quantum field Theory so yeah so it&#x27;s like one thing is like this you&#x27;re lost like science is the map and not the territory in my belief so yes like my my metaphysical world view is more like Plato like it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s something Beyond us that&#x27;s true it exists in the world of like forms and ideas but like when it comes to science I&#x27;m more kind of Aristotelian in and that what is useful is true and the quantum stuff is eminently useful if you want the most accurate sensor it&#x27;s a Quantum sensor if you want the best computer you know eventually it&#x27;ll be a quantum computer you know um uh uh uh quantum stuff just seems to work incredibly well especially at like lower scale subatomic scales and it and it&#x27;s really useful from an engineering standpoint and string theory is just basically trying to force fit what describes our kind of cosmological World Views of General with general relativity and um Quantum field Theory Force fit them with math and so you have a map here that&#x27;s not the map is not the territory so you have stuff that you you can do cool things with with Quantum field there you have some stuff you can do cool things with with general relativity neither are descriptors of the underlying reality so the maps are going to be a little Jagged and off string theory is like you have these Jagged off maps that aren&#x27;t perfect and you are forcing them together with math like it doesn&#x27;t take a genius like you or I could look at that and be like that&#x27;s the wrong approach yeah it&#x27;s just the wrong approach so that&#x27;s the way I look at it from like a more highlevel perspective as to like you know whether it&#x27;s some limited hangout they are all these really interesting things I&#x27;ve uncovered with so the people that funded quantum gravity were you know it was like a uh initially kind of established at this Chapel Hill conference at University of North Carolina 1957 yeah and it was this guy agnu bonson and he was obsessed with gravity and he wasn&#x27;t there also a guy named dwit and then Bryce DT Bryce dit yeah Institute of field physics was uh bonson outfit and Bryce thewit was his chief theoretical physicist and he&#x27;s uh basically convening the top physicist in the world at the time I don&#x27;t think anybody would argue with this like John Wheeler Peter Bergman you know Freeman Dyson like these Legends and they&#x27;re all trying to figure out why gravity breaks down you know at subatomic scale so like why gravity doesn&#x27;t work with Quantum stuff and that establishes the field of quantum gravity from which you could say string theory is like a later offshoot right this is the crazy part bonson in the back room is funding towns and brown and in my opinion I&#x27;ve uncovered all sorts of stuff as to why towns and brown experimentally is figuring out real physics and is using these capacitors and with high voltage experimentation in a way that ostensibly seems to create some sort of connection between electromagnetism and gravity which again if you were to talk to any conventional physicist they&#x27;d be like if you can experimentally do that that is crazy leads to all sorts of amazing possibilities propulsion calms whatever and so I think bondon was like funding some like you know back of thee house research with this guy Townsen Brown who was according to a couple of books this guy Paul Paul lolet um was maybe even at the Chapel Hill conference and the thing about Brown is he was never an amazing theoretician he was more of an experimentalist he was more of a Tesla type and he actually wasn&#x27;t like traditionally super credentialed but he had theories around what he was doing and I I think he was kind of breaking physics and and they&#x27;re all these kind of credible Witnesses who saw he was doing and we freaked out Edward Teller was one of those Witnesses freaked out Curtis L witnessed his experiments and so you know I think he was doing some really interesting off the book stuff and then meanwhile academic physics is being sent into a culdesac being sent into a dead end is that incidental and emergent I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m not I don&#x27;t know how conspiratorial to be about that but it&#x27;s fascinating yeah um Jeremy riss was explaining to me alien scientist he does great work on the he&#x27;s like a [ __ ] historian on on this anti-gravity history and all this stuff the the amount of knowledge he has is is unimaginable oh yeah but like I think he was explaining to me that um dwit and Whitten were both working on this stuff previous to that North Carolina Summit event or whatever it was yeah so yes so okay and then here&#x27;s the interesting String Theory connection Lewis Whitten was the representative of that conference from Ras which is Martin corporation&#x27;s anti-gravity research group and so Martin Corporation is pre-lock merger so it&#x27;s like the original lockie Martin has like an anti-gravity research group Lewis Whitten is researching gravity and he even says this there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a video online where he goes I was uh uh I was meant to research gravity and right right field told me to research Gravity the whole conference is sponsored by wri Airfield that&#x27;s crazy which is the epicenter of all UFO lore Bryce dwit almost worked at RAS as well and then he ended up at the Institute of field physics there all these interesting Aerospace connections John there was so much it was so B up in Aerospace that John Wheeler would complain at like the how like tied in tied to Aerospace and anti-gravity like he he kept being like you know all this talk of anti-gravity it&#x27;s just too much like we have to figure this out in like a serious Academic Way yeah um but that just shows you the prevailing ethos of you know the place itself and so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really fascinating uh right field had its own this guy named Josh Goldberg who is a PhD from Syracuse and they were systematically studying anti-gravity anti-gravity in the 50s was you know uh uh L Whitten even says this in the wind meaning it was everywhere but it also the other meaning of in the wind it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a spy term that could mean in the dark and so it&#x27;s really interesting like that there could be some double meaning there so the the tie between quantum gravity and string theory is Lou witton&#x27;s son is a guy named ed Wht yeah Ed Wht is the number one string theorist you know in the world Bar None and this is the guy that that Eric was talking about on The Joe Rogan podcast saying this guy is like Untouchable he&#x27;s like I&#x27;m so scared Michael Jordan exactly I&#x27;m so intimidated by this guy&#x27;s int intelligence yeah exactly like alien level yeah exactly so so that&#x27;s Ed Wht so that&#x27;s the son of the guy studying anti-gravity with Martin Corporation and establishing quantum gravity which is this culdesac so like your son is like the king of the culdesac and like maybe there&#x27;s some interesting updates going on in the back of the house with guys like towns and brown who also has a work history at Martin Corporation right he joined Martin Corporation in 1943 or two or three right when skunk workor starts the same year skunk work starts so H some interesting weird connections there a lot of smoke I don&#x27;t have fire so this LS Whitten fella has anyone talked to him have you ever talked to him has Eric ever talked to him he is I think 99 years old or something like it&#x27;s like so he&#x27;s super old and I have a friend who is corresponded over email with him and as soon as he said you know hey I want to get into the anti-gravity stuff the the line went dark and he stopped responding emails I make of it that we&#x27;ve made updates in the world of gravity that are off the books and not and you don&#x27;t even need me to say this like like the National Science foundation&#x27;s now coming out with these podcasts talking about extended electrodynamics and literally scientific Frameworks that if I were to say this a year ago to you you&#x27;d be like that&#x27;s quacky that doesn&#x27;t make any sense and like the this was relegated to like Zero Point Energy conferences in the Southwest like that you know some Crystal healer would tell you about extended electrodynamics and You&#x27; be like okay yeah go but it&#x27;s being Vindicated as real and uh electr gravitics being Vindicated a lot of people who are high up have kind of like hey you&#x27;re kind of oned things some things with this stuff and um I I just interviewed Carl Nell who&#x27;s the Army representative for the UAP task force worked alongside grush extremely smart was the deputy CTO of North rup Grumman part of what the argument I made in my towns in Brown documentary is that some of this gravity you know interesting gravity stuff made it into the B2 stealth bomber some of Brown&#x27;s work this is like the ion wind stuff like the yes somehow because it looks like the the stealth bombers they look like they defy gravity because they don&#x27;t look built like they&#x27;re like unless they have some super powerful jet engines the the uh which they do but most legendary air airspace journalist in uh the UK was a guy named Bill gunsten and he&#x27;s writing a survey level overview of All aerot Tech you know AO engine technology um since World War II and he gets to the B2 stealth bomber and he says um you know uh I do not wish to reside in the Tower of London so I will refrain from talking about clever wings with leading edges charged to millions of volts positive with trailing edges charged to millions of volts negative he&#x27;s talking about the B2 stealth bomber and um Aerospace uh uh or Aviation week Aviation week Bill Scott another you know amazing Aviation journalist he says you know when when the B2 gets revealed you know uh early 90s he&#x27;s like the B2 surfs its own wave and uses a Byfield Brown effect some people even think B2 is stands for bfield brown wow and so the majority owner of Northrup where the B2 came from north of Grumman yeah so this is Prem merger with Grumman the majority owner or the majority investor rather there&#x27;s a guy named Floyd odam he&#x27;s a lawyer he&#x27;s a financier for Aerospace he&#x27;s funding Brown&#x27;s research in Santa Monica right and that the the research fails quote unquote in &#x27; 67 then in&#x27; 68 three months later because the end of 67 early 68 they publish a paper North R saying we are looking into Electro aerodynamics and um and it&#x27;s this paper that was archived in the American Institute of astronautics and Aeronautics Aeronautics and astronautics and that paper just goes missing and so they retract that paper and say oh there&#x27;s nothing to see here whatever and then a couple decades later the B2 stealth bomber gets revealed so it&#x27;s like you tell me like I think there&#x27;s a there there [ __ ] ay dude so so so basically in the 50s before that conference in North Carolina like the idea is that or what Eric was speculating is a possibility that this stuff just went dark and got captured by these aerospace companies and like they came up with a plan to basically like deceive the public send the public down the string theory rabbit hole and take all this stuff that dwit and Whitten and brown were doing and make this part of this secret Black Project stuff I think it&#x27;s hard to say whether we just had updates in topological physics and experimental physics and we figured out some anomalies and like locally useful Frameworks where it&#x27;s like we know how this works in the context of a single you know this stealth aircraft but like how generalizable that gets like how much you with that I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s total black Bo to me and I don&#x27;t know how coordinated the sequestering of that there&#x27;s a ton of smoke there&#x27;s there&#x27;s not a lot of fire it&#x27;s just hard to say and then you can either say it was like sequestered by you know just humans you know where it&#x27;s like you you need you need topside science you need black side science or whatever which we definitely have I mean that&#x27;s ridiculous to say we don&#x27;t even like and you know uh Mark Andre and Ben Horwitz I think we at the White House and like some National Security Council person was like yeah we&#x27;re going to like regulate AI just like we regulated physics in the past like physics you&#x27;re talking about physics so like this has definitely been done the idea that it hasn&#x27;t been done is absurd um and so is that coordinated on a human level do you believe the three body problem stuff where the aliens are controlling the way science emerges to begin with right and like are they like playing deceptive tricks on our top scientists and then like inspiring other scienti like I don&#x27;t you get into these like crazy questions I don&#x27;t know how it went down have we made updates in science in the black yeah like you watch my towns and brown documentary I think it&#x27;s hard to come out of it being like this stuff is fake like if you actually like ingest the details it&#x27;s like pretty absolutely like even me have to think probabilistically but I&#x27;m 80% you I don&#x27;t know like yeah um and then so go back to Jake Barbara so so going back to this uh Jake Barber thing where they&#x27;re getting these psionic assets from other countries and getting them and putting them in this program using drugs and using protocols to get them to sort of summon these things he&#x27;s saying that the they&#x27;re using these people to summon these crafts mhm did he say he had any idea where they were coming from no that that was um the Jake interview was simultaneously felt historic and epic and he was so articulate and like such a good you know purveyor so intelligent grush yeah yeah totally and then where it was incredibly frustrating even in a way that like grush H grush is like can get into the theory and speculation and and is like a good FactFinder and it felt like with Jake he was was just he really wanted to like keep to like the core details of like what he experienced and it it made it it was a little frustrating for me cuz I I I think I&#x27;m strongest on the theory stuff and like that&#x27;s I always want to get into that [ __ ] and like I understand his position to like not want it you know totally go off the rails and speculating into crazy stuff and then there was uh some sort of tough book hard drive that was uh held underwater in a glacier Lake yep on top of a mountain yep yep yep and then and and he had to like retrieve that and then they were trying to like sever The Hidden Hand like they were trying to like basically uh get rid of him and like like because when you&#x27;re when you&#x27;re like sheep dipped like that and you&#x27;re like you know director of operations for a helicopter uh company there&#x27;s so much plausible deniability your employer can just be like that what do you tell that guy&#x27;s crazy you know just like people in the public are now saying you know Jake&#x27;s crazy or whatever even if though you know all these guys with dd214s and like clear history of like coming to back him up and I I think he&#x27;s totally legit but like who&#x27;s who&#x27;s backing him up uh you this guy Don Paul uh don Paul Bales uh other guys that Ross Kart has interviewed um so he&#x27;s one uh Fred Baker is another um John blitch I think knows him less well doesn&#x27;t have like a you know as much of a history with him but he&#x27;s a he&#x27;s a DARPA guy uh who&#x27;s come out and he vetted him I think on behalf of grush and some other people to see if he was the real deal he was like yeah this guy story totally comports with like the that world that I&#x27;ve you know come to know and research a little bit so it just seems so crazy to me that there like we on Earth with our motives our military motives and our financial motives are able to do something as crazy as summon something from another [ __ ] Dimension and crash it yeah so we can study it I it feels crazy to me too the the thing the question that that begets which I think is really important that we should all question is like you hear that we only have I don&#x27;t know 10 to 15 UFOs in our possession they&#x27;re any specific hangers or whatever or maybe you get one you know some people say one to two crashes a year so that would be you know since Roswell maybe since a little before that say 120 or what you know whatever but if you can like summon these things on command then you&#x27;d expect us to have a th000 plus right if you have a th000 plus you&#x27;re going to get leakage yes right so like it can&#x27;t be this like you put a coin in the slot machine that you know the drink comes out sort of vibe like it can&#x27;t just be this like extremely repeatable predictable thing right it has to be more hard to you know successfully do than that and so yeah there are all these questions that the interview beets that I think people should ask because I yeah I don&#x27;t know the answer to them yeah and like why like why isn&#x27;t he or people he knows or even Greers people being put in front of Congress and and test testifying all their stuff like why are they and Jake Jake said I would 100% testify before Congress and so that again that show of confidence I think is important you know to to which look I my guess is Congress has been lied to before I like I&#x27;ve been in like rooms with con I&#x27;m like God these guys are so they&#x27;re not smart but like um but uh you know I think just the fact that he&#x27;s he&#x27;s willing to do that I think and go under oath under you know threat of perjury I think is you know a good a good display yeah um so again I think the the the details are you know everybody has to think probabilistically but I think they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re pretty solid and then it&#x27;s like then what there are so many other questions that gets where it&#x27;s like what yeah yeah like what you were saying about like like being afraid to interact with this or try to interact try to summon it or try to somehow like do some one of the C5 things that that Greer talks about you know and one of the things that um I think I talked about with Greer was this hitchhiker effect yeah that happens where like not only can people get damaged or hurt or killed by the radiation or whatever it is that these things have but like there&#x27;s some sort of portal that&#x27;s permanently opened with you if you&#x27;re able to interact with this stuff or even see it to where now like you have all you have unlimited access to all this crazy um paranormal stuff yeah like some of the stuff that you see a skinwalker that&#x27;s extremely common like everybody yeah Skinwalker is a great example and and those cases I think it was very negative because again I think if you&#x27;re trying to like weaponize this stuff it explains yeah these kind of hauntings where these you know Aerospace practitioners come home and their their kids and their family get haunted by this stuff it is like they have like residue L Lou Alando always calls it a sticky portfolio and I think he calls it that for a very specific reason which is like stuff gloms onto you yeah like what what you know it&#x27;s like you stare at the abyss long enough the abyss stares back and I I think that&#x27;s just a truism especially in this top and then what do you make of all like the infighting of all these people like like alzando versus Greer versus like like you have alzando calling Greer a terrorist I think right right and like you know and simultaneously these guys are all writing books going on all these podcasts it&#x27;s just like what it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s weird uh and at times I see you know all the infighting and I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m like tired like I I just want want like more of like a normal life and like why am I like covering this like it&#x27;s just so ridiculous um it&#x27;s so easy to get fatigued by it it is it is I think like The Meta scop would be like you get distracted by this internal drama or whatever and like a rule that I really try to adhere to is I don&#x27;t go after anybody at homonym there&#x27;s like a map that I have of UFOs and like I should say this for the sake of your audience and my audience there are people I&#x27;ve interviewed that I ECT have ulterior motives mhm I don&#x27;t call out those ulterior motives because I&#x27;m in enough danger seeking truth and I don&#x27;t want it like I don&#x27;t want people like specifically coming after me because I&#x27;m like [ __ ] with them right not only that but there are people with alterior motives where like we said earlier there are elements of Truth to what they say and like a a lot of what they TR people can tell the truth in limited ways and have alterior motives that&#x27;s what people don&#x27;t understand so you can sift out valuable stuff so I think the the the best way is you know just be open Friendly cool with everybody you know I&#x27;m cool with you know the two guys you just mentioned I guess we I haven&#x27;t met yet but like I would be cool with him you know I&#x27;m just I just try to have like an open honest fun conversation and then glean out what I think is true and honestly ask rhetorical if there&#x27;s any untruths you ask rhetorical questions that like show on the face of it that like there&#x27;s something kind of going on here but like you don&#x27;t have to call it out directly because it&#x27;s just you&#x27;re just going to end up in some [ __ ] food fight on Twitter and it&#x27;s going to waste your time and you&#x27;re not going to get close to the truth that way you&#x27;re going to get distracted by like getting into it the times I feel conflicted about having that predisposition is like I do think there&#x27;s been like harassment of people and I see it on like Twitter and other places and like that [ __ ] with me cuz I&#x27;m like I want to like come out and defend you know uh uh anybody who&#x27;s been harassed just for looking into this stuff yeah and then and and by the way I&#x27;ve faced it too and there&#x27;s stuff I could tell you that would like I&#x27;ll I can tell you off air that&#x27;s like it&#x27;s [ __ ] crazy as far as stuff that&#x27;s come my way really yeah yeah um so yeah so like that that rils me up for sure wanting to defend other people um but otherwise man it&#x27;s just like it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s a Fool&#x27;s errand trying to like get get you know come after somebody yeah I agree you know so I just I try to stay like pretty you know Switzerland esque it seems like you&#x27;re the closest dude out there to this stuff like you&#x27;re you&#x27;re it&#x27;s seems like you have like flown closer to the Sun than anybody that&#x27;s not good man iist is not oh no like the people you know and the circles you run in like I mean I mean I&#x27;m not even just talking about working for Peter teal but like being befriending grush and you know talking to all these secret Aerospace people and getting all this stuff like you your brain you probably got more of this puzzle put together than most people I I thank you I mean 100% you have more of the puzzle than most people that are like in the media doing podcasts but like even when it comes to behind the scenes [ __ ] I thank you for saying that I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good spot to be in you that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m like if I&#x27;m if I&#x27;m one of these people or if I&#x27;m one of these folks that are in charge of this stuff I&#x27;m going to be maybe trying to get to you and subvert you 100% I think I&#x27;m being fully tracked at all times I think every every conversation every text every interaction um um and uh I think there insights that I&#x27;ve probably come to that have been gleaned and like taken for you know profit or whatever and uh you know that&#x27;s kind of weird um but like you got to just uh kind of ignore it put your blinders on keep going used to get to me more and now I just try to you know I think if you have pure intentions and you&#x27;re just trying to seek truth then I think things end well for you karmically you know but yeah it&#x27;s a it for sure it&#x27;s a weird spot to to be in I think it is partially because like if somebody tells me something and then they say not to say it like I I respect relationships like really like I I don&#x27;t if somebody you know is pro providing a you know as a source for something like I really I I don&#x27;t [ __ ] people over right like I and even for like I think in the microeconomics of like podcasting journalist world it&#x27;s like some of these people would like push their grandma in front of a moving taxi for a tip you know for a story and it&#x27;s like I just don&#x27;t do that [ __ ] like I just I uh you know and then if it that cuts against the truth I&#x27;m just not going to air it I&#x27;m not going to put it out you know but I&#x27;ll kind of walk away and not touch the Fine China and be like I kind of know what you&#x27;re up to but like I I don&#x27;t what would you do if if uh the CIA came to you Jesse Michaels we need to have a talk we&#x27;re going to tell you everything we&#x27;re going to give you access to everything but you need to shut the [ __ ] up or you need to just run with the stories that we gave you the green light here&#x27;s the thing I National Security Jesse I think that&#x27;s a counterfactual I don&#x27;t think the CIA has everything I don&#x27;t think the government has everything and I realize this might be you know slightly evading your question but it&#x27;s like genuinely I think it&#x27;s so important to to emphasize for people like it this is not a file that you can just get the government has tons of data that like reality is not what it seems they probably have metam material there&#x27;s probably some biologics there&#x27;s probably you know there&#x27;s a lot of stuff that where they like know reality is way weirder than what the average civilian does and in fact I think that you would say this too the closer you get to government circles the more they&#x27;re conspiratorial than the average citizen like they&#x27;re more conspiratory so they know that does that mean they have like an ontological worldview a map of what the aliens are what their intentions are how many races there are where they&#x27;re from whether they&#x27;re interdimensional extr TR absolutely not I think maybe you get in a certain core circles and areas they have better Frameworks than you know people on the Civil side do what if it was Patel that came to you Jesse Michaels we need to have a talk brother we&#x27;re going to fund your podcast $5 million a year subsidize by way I would I would never get like funded if the funding involves like steering the content like no yeah um if it&#x27;s like educational and like you know in in order to like tell the truth about something and there was some like public private partnership I would entertain it especially if I could be open to that to the public and I was wasn&#x27;t like lying about that yeah for sure like I don&#x27;t think like everybody in government&#x27;s like a bad person or like a it&#x27;s not a monolith right for sure um but yeah know I wouldn&#x27;t like I wouldn&#x27;t do some like intentional limited hangout thing yeah yeah it&#x27;d be it&#x27;d be an interesting bridge to cross if the opportunity ever presented itself I always think about that is that your pitch Danny yeah you&#x27;re like you&#x27;re like just hit me up it&#x27;s so funny H yeah would it matter because I mean most people online already think that were CIA I know dude it&#x27;s exactly half the people are like she&#x27;s a spook and he&#x27;s funded by Peter teal and blah blah blah yeah right yeah you&#x27;re already you&#x27;re already you got an uphill battle it&#x27;s an uphill battle for sure for sure and like I don&#x27;t know I always just like okay don&#x27;t trust anything I&#x27;m saying like fine and then like the people who do like you&#x27;re going to learn a lot of crazy [ __ ] because I&#x27;m revealing like really crazy [ __ ] stuff that I came to on my own and honestly I&#x27;ve lost I&#x27;ve put a lot of money like like the opportunity cost in involved in like stud like going after UFOs like I I managed like nine figures of capital like I was investing a lot of money in a way that would have been like really good for my future if I wanted like a chill good life like I had that like set up like I easily could have kept going on the path I was going on do some conventional Venture fund you know have [ __ ] cocktails at happy hour in La go to [ __ ] Beverly Hills Hotel and go to like I could have done that and I and I decided to go like a way more masochistic route so it&#x27;s fine like you can call me whatever but like trust me it&#x27;s not [ __ ] that yeah how do you have time to do the investing stuff anymore I honestly don&#x27;t do that much of it anymore it&#x27;s like yeah it&#x27;s like most of what we&#x27;ve done like I&#x27;m managing up on you know like existing Investments and just making sure they&#x27;re going well and I&#x27;m like in touch with the you know the fund managers that I&#x27;ve sourced as well as uh the companies themselves and then occasionally if something jumps the bar and feels like a no-brainer I&#x27;ll do a little bit of I&#x27;ll do diligence on like you know an early stage thing where it&#x27;s more qualitative and not quantitative analysis and I&#x27;ll do a deal but it&#x27;s like I was deploying much more money 3 years ago than I am now so it&#x27;s just slowed down right what is to you what is the absolute spookiest darkest Sinister theory about what these things are that you&#x27;ve heard that you may not believe but that you&#x27;ve heard that you think may have may have some little bit of Merit like the one that you don&#x27;t want to be true I can&#x27;t say it really yeah it&#x27;s too dark yeah it&#x27;s really [ __ ] say it because you be betraying somebody or because you just don&#x27;t want to put it out there I don&#x27;t want to put it out there really yeah there there are well there are probably good factions that are Angelic you know to use a simple term and then bad factions that are demonic and then what are the demonic things doing let like maybe they&#x27;re mining our attention you know like Robert Monroe who studied Consciousness and you know um you know Virginia has this institute you know that he started like he he had this concept of Louch and so maybe there&#x27;s stuff like that going on where like when you&#x27;re in a zombie state where does your Consciousness go maybe that&#x27;s sort of like a mining process but then you look at like you know scapegoating Cycles like Pig and scapegoating cycles and like I don&#x27;t know you get into a weird territory and like I it&#x27;s hard to I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what the darkest you know theory is but um I think the the good ones are like don&#x27;t don&#x27;t interfere as much with you and you&#x27;re more like you&#x27;re ascending to their level and it&#x27;s like a two-way bilateral connection where like one of my favorite quotes is uh the world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper and it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s once if if you can like increase your own you know kind of spiritual sense and your knowledge and you can increase the purity of your intention I think you get closer to to truth around a lot of these things and I think this idea this bifurcation this idea that it&#x27;s just academic rote knowledge that you have to learn and then this kind of you know spiritual sense like that&#x27;s different like your own you know moral development as a person I think they go hand in hand and I think the more you do that the more you have synchronicities the more you get in touch you you feel this sort of angelic guidance in your life the more you feel protected and and and and uh and so I think whatever&#x27;s good is like this kind of non- interferent initiation process and then the bad stuff you know I don&#x27;t know in the in the world in which these beings exist they&#x27;re probably behind a whole lot of human Affairs and they&#x27;re probably stoking Wars and causing violence and Division and then you have to ask why and I don&#x27;t know why right well I mean why wouldn&#x27;t they be like us right why why wouldn&#x27;t there be good versions and bad versions totally totally yeah you have good and bad humans yeah yeah I I agree with that have you ever seen a UFO in real life oh yeah yeah yeah really yeah I&#x27;ve seen more than one see that&#x27;s the thing that I I&#x27;m kind of like on the fence about sure because like like me and you talk about this stuff all the time but I I don&#x27;t know if I want to have any of these experiences I don&#x27;t know if I want to actually encounter this kind of [ __ ] in real life I don&#x27;t know how that would affect me I think that&#x27;s totally valid and I definitely don&#x27;t want to have an abduction experience like I actually get everybody I interview who&#x27;s had an abduction experience I my buddy from yes the Amar kandal who does a lot of the shows with me I make him come with me because he&#x27;s like this like positive energy like protective energy bubble and I&#x27;m like I get spooked I get freaked even with Whitley I was a little freaked out dude I&#x27;ve never been more terrified yeah and he&#x27;ll say stuff like oh people he said it with you I remember he said like people who are with me sometimes have like experiences and I remember you&#x27;re like I was like I don&#x27;t want that he&#x27;s like it might happen to you absolutely it&#x27;ll happen to you I&#x27;m like please no please no he&#x27;s like okay I&#x27;ll tell him not to yeah yeah yeah no I I think um Annie Jacobson when she wrote a great book The phenomenon um yes also I think she was like she was talking to Jac valet and she was like please like don&#x27;t don&#x27;t I just don&#x27;t want to get abducted like I&#x27;ll study this stuff but yeah once you start studying this stuff you the second you realize like a switch in your brain goes off and you&#x27;re like okay this person&#x27;s not crazy and they&#x27;ve been abducted like this stuff&#x27;s actually just real then it freaks you out cu you&#x27;re like uh oh am I you know so I I I I feel that on the abduct I don&#x27;t want to get abducted man no I don&#x27;t want to ever see any of these things in my bedroom same same but I do think there&#x27;s a huge difference between that like being inspired by some like cool craft in the sky like I think that&#x27;s kind of chill yeah I think it&#x27;s and for me that was like a that was like a beautiful what did you see exactly although I will say abduction experiences I think over 50% are often described as positive so or over 50% are are are positive at least in the free Edgar Mitchell study but oh okay I saw cuz Whitley is a horror movie yeah I know I know and a lot a lot are and a lot again it goes back to that like Droid gray thing where it&#x27;s like we do not fear but then they like bleeding everywhere and they like put a little thing in you and it&#x27;s going black out and it&#x27;s like oh God that doesn&#x27;t sound good at all um my uh UFO experience well I had I had two that like really stand out and that are one was in Laurel Canyon and I I talked about this on Julian dory&#x27;s podcast as well where it looked it looked like a school bus or something like it was like nothing like prosaically that I ever see and so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll call it a UFO I don&#x27;t know you know if it could have been Aerospace but it was hovering above the Treetops at like you know 40 50 fet and it was it was going across the Treetops and then the uh the woman I was with she said that she saw the thing like descend down like uh across the the Treetops in Laurel Canyon I didn&#x27;t see that but what I saw was like it was like this like kind of tessera like rectangle shaped like School Bus like thing that like I&#x27;ve just never seen before ever and was so weird and the way it came about was also weird too cuz aliens had just come up in our discussion so it it was like one of us was like do you believe in aliens and like and then some point I was like yeah I&#x27;m kind of super into aliens actually I things is really interesting and then I was like I kind of it would be interesting to meet an alien and then she goes um it&#x27;ll come when you least expect it and this is the weirdest part of the story is we walk by a guy who&#x27;s has a metal detector and it&#x27;s like Sunset a little after sunset or sunset in Laurel Canyon and it&#x27;s like why does he have a metal detector he&#x27;s like looking for something and it says it&#x27;ll come when or she said it&#x27;ll come when you stop looking for it and he&#x27;s like looking for weird and that could be again me noticing too many patterns but like um then we walk and we just see this little clearing and then the thing goes over I&#x27;m like what color was it [ __ ] it was gray metallic and uh yeah it it was like seemed like I don&#x27;t know wasn&#x27;t making like enough noise where like the amount of weight that it was carrying like you&#x27;d expect like an absurd amount of noise like Apache level like 10 Apache level you know so super super strange and was around a time in my life where I was experiencing a lot of kind of like interesting synchronicities and like things would kind of pop into you know that was when I I was around the time when I met Diana Pula actually and like I started to kind of take take more of a dive down the down the rabbit hole the other time I was doing holotropic breath work in Silver Lake with a friend a friend who&#x27;s I I won&#x27;t out him but he&#x27;s a prominent investor who&#x27;s like as rational as it gets like he&#x27;s actually really interested in like philosophy and you know academic science and stuff and like the way he&#x27; describe his worldview is like the natural philosophers like David Hume super Nome Chomsky like he couldn&#x27;t be more like the material world is what it is like he&#x27;s kind of like a material world like a materialist atheist you know and we had just gone surfing and then we&#x27;re back at his spot in Silver Lake and I I want to teach him holotropic breath work which is I love holotropic is the best and uh we&#x27;re doing it and he kind of like five minutes in like you&#x27;re your hands can kind of clam up it&#x27;s like a common thing and like you get into like an interesting State and all of a sudden he looks up he&#x27;s like what is that oh my God two metallic or like one above him one above me they look like they&#x27;re way too high to be you know praic aircraft I I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you like what you know 60,000 880,000 but like they were high up and they were like bobbing like hovering and uh he go this is so funny like initially he goes I goes what I go what the [ __ ] do you think those things are and he goes I those that must be one of those like deep black you know locked crafts or whatever and I&#x27;m like interesting and then a second later he goes dude those are not like of Earth how long ago was this this was 2020 2020 yeah this is either that was either the um the Laurel Canon was 2020 that was either 2020 or 2021 okay either late 2020 or early 2021 yeah holy [ __ ] yeah yeah F it&#x27;s interesting the only thing I&#x27;ve ever seen was with Chris bledo so you saw UFO I mean I don&#x27;t think it it was nothing like that it was just like a ball of light like what he what he the stuff that he summons and he was trying to do it do yeah he was praying and do you I don&#x27;t know like Okay g to your head you&#x27;re wrong if you you know you&#x27;re wrong and you die okay would you say that that was like human aircraft or prosaically explained ball light or whatever or like some kind of celestial like otherworldly thing I would say if I had a gun in my head I and my my best guess yeah would be that it&#x27;s some sort of natural phenomenon that happens in the atmosphere that we just don&#x27;t that I just don&#x27;t notice because I don&#x27;t stare at the sky enough yep because me and Stephen were out there for two hours trying to find something with him praying to the heavens and then we saw this thing it was definitely not an airplane yep I know it wasn&#x27;t an airplane what it looked like we have a video of it it was a it came off of The Horizon it was like a little ball of light came up off the Horizon where the water met the the air and it came up started going this way then got really really bright then got really really dim and then just fizzled out so H so how would you explain that from a scientific perspective I don&#x27;t know yeah I don&#x27;t know ball lightning something like that like a like ball lightning some sort of atmospheric anomaly yeah but was there anything that would you know cause ball lightning I have no idea I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know the science behind it but like if I was to the I know it was not an airplane yeah yeah yeah and the way it was moving would definitely showed that it wasn&#x27;t an airplane cuz we saw airplanes that were flying there there was airplanes flying off the beach or off the ocean onto land to land in Tampa Airport and they had they had navigation lights flashing and stuff like that they were obviously following a specific flight flight pattern and this thing was not doing that it didn&#x27;t have the flashing lights it got brighter dimmer fizzled out to nothing came off there here it is came off the atmosphere so this is The Horizon of the uh can you see the Horizon down there where it&#x27;s like cuz it&#x27;s so dark it&#x27;s one more time this is North Carolina no this is here oh here there it is oh there&#x27;s something right on the water right on the water thank you thank you that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for if you could flash for us that&#x27;s an airplane on the top that&#x27;s not uh-huh I&#x27;m getting it that&#x27;s your orb there right there now start going to the right W it&#x27;s still in here and now no another one above it see yeah and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s zigzagging that one Fizzles out look at this one on the left look at this one look how bright it&#x27;s getting wow here someone needs to look through this it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very bright thank you w oh you see it it&#x27;s right there you see it that is an orb that is definitely an orb I&#x27;m I&#x27;m tracking it here do you want to look yeah and then it fizzled out to nothing H let me find it faded in and faded out they were seeing it with the naked eye I didn&#x27;t see it until I put in his little psionic uh camera thing that sees in like the dark but like maybe has something to do with that camera but I don&#x27;t know also they were seeing it with their naked eye uhhuh but like I don&#x27;t know how do you explain that I don&#x27;t know I got to talk to somebody who knows about like this stuff I mean I don&#x27;t know do you see how it comes off of The Horizon like that though that&#x27;s crazy do that again Steve yeah cuz that&#x27;s is that water rewind that&#x27;s water yeah go to the very beginning move the controller too so we can see the Horizon watch watch look at that [Applause] what it was so far away you know it was like how many how far away would you say that was Steve I think the from our Vantage Point The Horizon is probably like three miles yeah look how it starts going to the right too yeah yeah and then it kind of goes back it kind of Zig yeah like what flies like that I don&#x27;t know I think there&#x27;s some there&#x27;s definitely something to what he&#x27;s doing like what he&#x27;s doing is absolutely legit and real I don&#x27;t know how to explain it do you sense interesting energy when you&#x27;re around him like do you just like feel it like I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know what to attribute that to I don&#x27;t know whether to attribute that to whether I&#x27;m I&#x27;m just sort of being affected by the energy and that&#x27;s just a normal thing like it&#x27;s just his vibe that he gives off yeah you know and and it&#x27;s just affecting me like affecting my soul in a way where I&#x27;m like I&#x27;m in it and I&#x27;m believing it in the moment I&#x27;m like oh my god wow this is [ __ ] blowing my mind this is real what is this yeah or like like I said is this something that you could just go anywhere and stare at the sky all night long and see this stuff all the time that seemed anomalous to me at the very least that doesn&#x27;t seem like if you were to do some like meta study on like the probability of seeing that even in a 2hour period where you&#x27;re staring at the sky extremely low yeah what is that right that&#x27;s weird now I&#x27;m not saying that that&#x27;s definitely UFO and Angel and orb I don&#x27;t know but but it I think it&#x27;s worthy of a investigation yeah and then like like detractors would say that like maybe he set somebody up with a boat and a drone outside there but like off the beach there you get that vibe from him I don&#x27;t at all I get I get you know maybe everybody in UFO world where a lot of people are credulous and high on the openness scale I don&#x27;t from my you know conversations with Chris blood so I think he&#x27;s a good person me too and and and also he had no idea where we were going to dinner that night we just went to I told him a random restaurant I took him to on the beach he didn&#x27;t know where it was and I said or afterwards I&#x27;m like you want to go to across to the beach to see if we can do this he&#x27;s like oh yeah let&#x27;s do it I got my camera with me and his daughter and his wife and his his his uh his his daughter and his wife were also there yeah and and he just did it yeah I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a hoax man I there&#x27;s something something going on there&#x27;s something going on and the wildest thing is all these people that are attaching themselves to him which is like the craziest thing crazy people where if I mean dude like we&#x27;re in like a war with China why would we be spending those sorts of resources on a guy who&#x27;s seeing orbs you know in North Carolina outside his backyard if it weren&#x27;t something actually kind of profound and interesting MH like why right because these guys are like we&#x27;re not just connecting Dots here like this is like legitimate stuff yeah yeah the like this stuff is all documented that the the people that are that are visiting him and befriending him yeah Jim semivan is like very well respected at the CIA like he&#x27;s like pretty I think High up and like he spent a lot of time with Chris bledo I think they&#x27;re good friends so it&#x27;s interesting that combined with the fact that that video is completely went unsearchable in one in an instant Wild on YouTube that&#x27;s weird and we like I was good like after that thing dropped I would go every day you probably do this where you just I searched Chris bledo on YouTube every day yeah for like the first week just to see where it was ranking right it was top for the first week the day it dropped you couldn&#x27;t find it you would you could go a thousand Pages deep and never find it it was just it was just four or five or six um History Channel videos of him with on the History Channel you want to know something funny huh you could type in David grush to this day I&#x27;m not to T my own horn but the video I did with him is the best video that he has and and like you can&#x27;t find it you could type in David grush on YouTube and it&#x27;s news Nation Rogan a bunch of other thing and it&#x27;s my thing is unsearchable and it in five days six days got well over 2 million views and then it just got throttled and and everybody I mean I&#x27;m working with yes theory on it they have 9 million subscribers on YouTube and I&#x27;m showing them the stats like the clickthrough rate and average view duration they&#x27;re like we&#x27;ve never seen anything this high like what like what the [ __ ] and like you watch it and it&#x27;s like very watchable and it&#x27;s just imp here we&#x27;re going through right now it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re searching David uh with the c is that it yeah but go to Dave David uh g r u s c h have you seen it before though uh I don&#x27;t know search go down look there it is bro that that looks good we&#x27;re back baby it definitely was and like I have an email chain with Google about where it wasn&#x27;t so like I have the receipts that it was unsearchable this happened to my whitly streer episode too but only for the first two weeks okay after the first two weeks they put it back well also go on Incognito I I do want to see if it&#x27;s the same open up cuz you&#x27;ve seen the video open up an incognito browser yeah new private window yeah whatever but you&#x27;re saying that it can come back get off Brave get off Brave go to go to Chrome yeah sometimes what they&#x27;ll do is they&#x27;ll make it invisible on search for the first two weeks when it&#x27;s going to get shared the most and go viral catch traction the most after the first two weeks you&#x27;re already posted your next video then they&#x27;ll put it back so they can plausibly deny the fact that okay so we&#x27;re good now we&#x27;re we&#x27;re we&#x27;re numbered two now type in Chris bledo yeah let&#x27;s do that which is all it&#x27;s been a year now so it&#x27;s not as relevant but yeah scroll down that&#x27;s my boy Chris Ramy made an epic one keep going keep going just go faster you&#x27;ll be able you&#x27;ll definitely notice it if it pops up see those history ones were the first ones to pop up last time and you&#x27;re just just nowhere to be found and and you know what&#x27;s funny there was even a guy who re-uploaded my full podcast on his Channel with him reacting to it that was popping up what yeah oh shoot it&#x27;s really good yeah that was the same with the grush thing for me origin it was like all these like like analysis of the video videos were ranking higher that&#x27;s so crazy now go back to the top Steve so nuts man and yeah yours was like the first big one go back to the scroll to the very top it&#x27;s still the most viewed I&#x27;m pretty sure go to the and get out of the search thing see where it says filters on the far right yeah filter by most viewed yeah it&#x27;s probably probably yours top top no right right view count yeah view count 3.9 yeah no that&#x27;s you forbidden w wow holy crap wow wow that&#x27;s wild man and you have in your tags and stuff you have like no like I said it was the number one search result for the first like two weeks and then it&#x27;s crazy to see mine number two yeah is that right well dude I I swear to God the guy at YouTube literally told me this yeah he told you that exactly that mine like fell off a cliff wise yeah and it went it went completely invisible went completely invisible and then yes theories they said okay this is yes theories they say it&#x27;s the best stats they have on any video and it&#x27;s one of their lower it&#x27;s like in the lower 25% viewed videos like it only has 1.1 million views which for them is or 2 Point Mill 1.2 or 1.1 million views which for them is extremely low like they have crazy crazy high viewed stuff yeah and it the stats are like off the charts so like they&#x27;re also like super conspiratorial about this and they&#x27;re like the most like kidfriendly do good or like they&#x27;re like the best Vibes like they&#x27;re not and like they&#x27;re not breaking rules they&#x27;re not breaking rules and like when they&#x27;re like yeah we&#x27;re getting throttled like I&#x27;m like I don&#x27;t know yeah people some people are are speculating that the uh the Trump thing is going to do like some sort of a trust bust on YouTube and and force them to stop regulating this stuff so much and stomping on content well dude Trump made that like misinformation is [ __ ] like you know it&#x27;s like this like speech or whatever like right when he got elected I I loved it to be I misinformation is so condescending yes who is the Arbiter of misinformation like why are you why do you decide you&#x27;re so wrong you&#x27;ve proven to be so incompetent in the context of the pandemic and Co and all these other like the history of American false Flags why are you the Arbiter like why BBC trusted news initiative CNN you can say what is misinformation you don&#x27;t think for yourself like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s ridiculous so let out and let people decide let people decide what they think is [ __ ] and what they think is real yeah no the the um the Mike Ben stuff really illuminates all that disinformation misinformation stuff and how they go to like other countries and like force them to regulate stuff and they basically hold the corporations like they pit them against like maintaining their monopolies overseas like okay well if you&#x27;re going to if you&#x27;re going to censor this stuff we&#x27;ll let you keep your Monopoly in Europe right like dude that stuff is crazy it&#x27;s crazy and speaking of the that in the context of the UFO topic I should say the usaid funded The Intercept we know that for sure Ken klippenstein came out with basically leaked Dave gush&#x27;s uh medical records and and that is what like kind of marginalized grush for for a while I mean I think most people don&#x27;t really bu like realize it&#x27;s [ __ ] I mean the dude like was an Afghanistan combat veteran was deployed and like his buddy like died next to him was like mortared and Stu like it&#x27;s just [ __ ] up like and that&#x27;s what they and like so like you know when he would drink occasionally he would like go through that he would re simulate those feelings for him and Ken klipstein who&#x27;s working for a usaid funded publication is leaking these medical records right after grush testifies before Congress to discredit him it&#x27;s just weird man yeah that is super [ __ ] feels really coordinated God man yeah the usaid thing is like such a nuclear bomb for the for the government man like that that stuff is just bananas and how it&#x27;s like you can&#x27;t escape it it&#x27;s too big it&#x27;s too big to to squash we&#x27;ve just been living in managed reality for decades yeah yeah spending spending two billion or how many billions of dollars on on trans operas in the Ukraine and like all this stupid stuff they&#x27;re funding everywhere like yeah God damn Ian Carol&#x27;s been doing a great job of talking about this stuff this he does like crazy deep Dives on USA and all this stuff he&#x27;s awesome yeah he&#x27;s dope have you have you um are you familiar with like the history of Google and Sergey Brin and like Google being incubated by the CIA and NSA you were telling me some stuff here I mean I know that uh menx right was like the DARPA search engine that kind of dovetailed with Google but otherwise I don&#x27;t you tell me I&#x27;m yeah so no there there&#x27;s a um I don&#x27;t know much about it other than this like crazy article I read on it recently about this I forget the guy&#x27;s name uh it was on substack I think and he wrote um he did like a super deep dive and it&#x27;s all connected to um Serge at Stanford was and the guy that he was working under were literally funded and visited the whole time and incubated by CIA and NSA people that were visiting him and like checking in on him with the search with the rank system and all this stuff and giving him stuff that was created by DARPA like it&#x27;s all connected to DARPA and saic and like all this crazy military industrial complex stuff say I was you know based in Palo Alto yeah yeah so like it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s so like it basically where did you learn all this it from these from the stuff that I read wow and it&#x27;s it the implications of it is that Google was quite literally funded and created by the CIA and DARPA yeah so what does that even mean like how do you like well you know you know like oracle&#x27;s first contract was with the CIA and like I I do think a lot of this stuff gets created in the black right paler too right like pal like like like I understand that I understand why you would want to create companies that you you&#x27;re you&#x27;re literally you&#x27;re you&#x27;re doing it in reverse instead of creating a company and finding clients you&#x27;re you&#x27;re finding a hole or you&#x27;re finding a need that the government has a government who has billions of dollars in in resources to invest in this stuff find a way to do it better and you&#x27;re basically creating a company that already has a built-in client the US government which is like essentially what paler is right or what elon&#x27;s doing with space I think it&#x27;s what it ended up becoming I think originally it was like around like some of the fraud detection stuff they were doing at PayPal or whatever dovetailed with the software for paler and then I think the CIA became one of the first customers right um but I I don&#x27;t think it created in in conjunction with but I&#x27;m just saying if it was me and I was if I was one of these guys that was creating one of these crazy companies right that was doing surveillance and and whatever the hell it does like I would say we have a huge opportunity to make millions of dollars off the government doing this stuff because we can do it better than they can do it right I think if you even had guys in here like Andrew Buon who have literally said paler is way better than all the stuff that we have at CIA like we use pal like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it works way better right right like it&#x27;s a great business proposition to create a company like that but like find out who wrote that article about um Google uh I think the I think the title of it was um how Google how Google made or no no it was how the CIA created Google interesting and it&#x27;s on substack I want to give this guy credit there&#x27;s um while you&#x27;re looking that up there was a project at DARPA called LIF log and it was like like you know like networking all these people and like their friends and like their friend networks and I think it was shut down in 2003 or four right before Facebook started so I do find that kind of interesting too but I don&#x27;t I have again I have no idea if there&#x27;s a connection there yeah but it is no this isn&#x27;t it Steve it&#x27;s uh you don&#x27;t have to type in um did you type in substack after oh yeah you did keep going uh I mean medium medium that&#x27;s it right there medium yeah that&#x27;s it I&#x27;m sorry I messed up this is it oh you can close that close that bottom thing and you&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll be able to see who it&#x27;s by let&#x27;s at least credit the author how the CIA made Google by Naf Nafi Ahmed Ahmed Nafi Ahmed dude this is mindblowing it&#x27;s a two it&#x27;s a two uh there&#x27;s two articles like a series of them I can&#x27;t wait to read this but it&#x27;s great man interesting blew my mind wow well I always found it interesting like they were kind of I mean it makes total sense especially with the Snowden stuff in 2013 like prison bull run all that stuff came out and it&#x27;s clear that the NSA just had like back doors into like all of these big tech companies and then they had they even the NSA had a program I think at the time called heartbeat which is like you can like basically query anybody&#x27;s you know data or whatever like in like this like centralized database repository so we know that that was a thing at the at the very least but I found it interesting when Google like uh as part of project Maven like would wouldn&#x27;t work with the US government and then simultaneously they were going into China like that same year and so there&#x27;s like something like I&#x27;m like how coordinated is this stuff and if it is coordinated you know is it at are are you talking about the thing where recently right where Google came out publicly and said that we&#x27;re not going to work with the Govern US government to to it was some sort of like a part of some War they basically came out publicly 2017 okay yeah 2017 2018 yeah this was like a big public thing that they interesting interesting well they were the biggest donors to cala number one donor yeah man corporate donor so yeah dude yeah so it&#x27;s funny like we both you know are so dependent on YouTube and I I do I&#x27;m like it does make me occasionally nervous because it&#x27;s like it does I&#x27;m grateful to Elon Musk man so was you know who else was a huge donator to cala was um what&#x27;s his name Alex karp you know who that is that Alex karp was the CEO of paler of paler yeah that&#x27;s really interesting really interesting that I didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t suspect that he I mean uh I read that I read there&#x27;s a New York Times piece that came out on him recently where they&#x27;re interviewing him about this stuff and he&#x27;s like he donated to Kamal yeah he was literally saying in there how he donated millions of dollars to um the democ the Democratic party and um he&#x27;s always described himself as a like leftwing guy right yeah he&#x27;s like super into Hegel and like you know very like a almost like a Neo IST or something but also with Peter right they&#x27;re like really good friends like they&#x27;ve known each other forever since College from back in the day yeah Stanford law I believe yeah yeah um yeah so I but he&#x27;s also like he doesn&#x27;t have any any sort of hesitation in in working with the US government to advance American Supremacy us Supremacy I think they&#x27;re like mission in many ways is like they they want to protect the Free World yeah and uh you know I think they are responsible for a lot of uh you know big threats to the US uh you know going down and I think that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a pretty good thing so um yeah I know I know there are a lot of conspiracies about them oh there&#x27;s so many conspiracies bro they&#x27;re mostly and that&#x27;s what the other thing people don&#x27;t understand it&#x27;s like for me they&#x27;re mostly a black box like I don&#x27;t really like interact with too much but yeah yeah have you have you heard I mean I&#x27;ve met like have you heard of Whitney web oh yeah yeah yeah she goes deep on the the stuff she&#x27;s like dude she like frustrates me cuz she&#x27;s clearly really smart and showing a ton of Courage like going deeper on like Epstein networks than like anybody else which is epic and then now she&#x27;s like and now it&#x27;s all you know Peter and and paler whatever it&#x27;s like no it&#x27;s not and your book is so convoluted it&#x27;s almost like if you wanted a scop to throw people off the trail for rep scene would be that book like it&#x27;s so complicated again I don&#x27;t want to like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an it&#x27;s an amazing I read it yet I&#x27;ve tried to read it okay and it um and it does she makes all sorts of amazing connections it&#x27;s like a thousand pages long it&#x27;s crazy and she&#x27;s she doing an amazing service I think and uh so like very net positive Whitney web but like there&#x27;s certain areas where like it feels like she&#x27;s just anti like anybody who&#x27;s rich and Powerful like anybody like she&#x27;s anti Elon you know with all the stuff he&#x27;s doing around Free Speech right and the usaid and rooting them out of our institutions like who do you want to do that you need somebody that powerful to do that so who&#x27;s like ultimately like politics like is where like the Battleground takes place and like it&#x27;s a power game and you need the people with who are the most powerful like who probably made certain expedient alliances to get to where they are like doing things to like get anything done and I feel like she&#x27;s super like if if you are not yeah so cynical and if you are not like you don&#x27;t pass some like crazy Purity litmus test you are the devil or whatever and like I would just say like look yeah like maybe everybody at the elite strata or whatever has like you know had to you know at times make Unholy alliances right but like who who side are you on and I think I think like some real good is being done in this like new Trump admin and with Elon and Tulsi and like Tulsi and RFK like I mean those those two specifically like really I think were on the side of Truth when it was unpopular specifically RFK Jr I mean I love that guy I think he&#x27;s epic yeah um so yeah I I&#x27;m a fan of Whitney webs but I do think she can just be so like ideologically purist at times totally um but yeah I&#x27;m glad she exists yeah yeah yeah she&#x27;s definitely she definitely does good work but like yeah that stuff gets the rabbit holes are never ending when it comes to that stuff if you don&#x27;t like you know you have to follow like it&#x27;s not just it&#x27;s not black and white right like you can&#x27;t just I guess you can you can you can shred anybody you want for anything and find out every bad thing that somebody has done but you got to recognize like the net positive that people are doing as well 100% anybody at a certain level of power unless it&#x27;s like the cir tole dude who like was like you know started from like with a homeless troop of circus or like the Patagonia founder like occasionally you&#x27;ll meet somebody where it&#x27;s like you got nothing you know EXA but like anybody in the elite world of business politics government yeah I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t name too many people where it&#x27;s like there aren&#x27;t things that you you know had to do you know and so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a human nature it is it is unfortunately there&#x27;s a political game that has to be played to get [ __ ] done in Washington like you have to play that [ __ ] game there&#x27;s no way around it totally and I I don&#x27;t want to [ __ ] do I mean that&#x27;s [ __ ] [ __ ] no it&#x27;s that being in politics now like I grew up actually being like maybe I&#x27;d want to be in like when I was really little I was maybe I&#x27;m interested in politics and be cool and then now I&#x27;m like it&#x27;s a selector for the worst people just the worst like just sellouts like just spineless like the people are just obsessed with Optics yeah and uh yeah it sucks yeah it&#x27;s weird [ __ ] it&#x27;s weird [ __ ] for sure well dude thank you for doing this brother we almost did four hours wow what time is it what you&#x27;re
