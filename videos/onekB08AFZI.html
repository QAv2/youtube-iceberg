            <p>What the heck are quaternians? Defining rotations in 3D space is complex. You need to express the rotation axis vector and how much you want to rotate around it. That&#x27;s where quaternians come into play. These are four-dimensional objects where the first expresses the rotational amount and the other three express the rotation axis vector. Why math libraries use these so much? That&#x27;s because they&#x27;re both accurate and compact.</p>
