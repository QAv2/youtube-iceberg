            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up veters? Patrick here with Vetted. There was a brand new whistleblower who goes by the pseudonym Michael who has recently come out and I&#x27;ve got the full story. Uh especially some brand new comments from Representative Eric Berles about this particular whistleblower. What makes him interesting is that allegedly he&#x27;s the first civilian UFO whistleblower. Meaning he had no uh relationship, you know, with advanced aerospace companies.</p>
<p>He wasn&#x27;t contractor. He wasn&#x27;t in the military. Nothing. Not a government employee in any way, shape, or form. And he allegedly has superb video and photos and physical evidence of something anomalous.</p>
<p>Now, it even could be America&#x27;s Advanced Tech. So, this whistleblower came out. He is apparently a client of Ivan Hunnel. Again, I hope I&#x27;m saying that name right. That is Luis Alzando&#x27;s lawyer.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;ve got the full story because there&#x27;s a lot of controversy involved with this, too. Um Tim Phillips, who was um with Arrow, recently let go, mind you. But before that, he had done some interviews and one with MC West, and um he said some things about this whistleblower, Michael. It&#x27;s not too good. He basically accused him of trying to extort the American government.</p>
<p>Basically like, hey, give me money for this evidence, otherwise I&#x27;m taking it to a foreign government. I&#x27;m not joking. That&#x27;s the accusation. I&#x27;ve got all the details. And again, especially these brand new comments from Representative Eric Berles about this whistleblower, and I think you&#x27;ll be surprised when you hear what he has to say.</p>
<p>Now, this whistleblower has also released some statements that we&#x27;re going to go over. So, we&#x27;ll get to all that, but first um we&#x27;re going to play a clip uh from Yvon Hanel uh again, Luis Alzando&#x27;s lawyer, um Ivan, sorry, um on that UFO podcast, and he&#x27;s going to kind of explain a little bit who this whistleblower is. a new client of mine uh which we can talk about whenever you wish um has given me information which I now believe for many different reasons and and frankly in part because of what Tim Phillips himself said on Mick West podcast and that is something that I think is still slipping under the radar of most people in eupfology. they don&#x27;t understand how important it is what Tim Phillips inadvertently said uh on Mick West podcast uh and and that particular you know dialogue or or part of the interview uh very much surprised me because it basically said that what a new client of mine and again I want to make it clear it&#x27;s not Louano uh and he&#x27;s not actually a new client I&#x27;ve known him for you know I don&#x27;t know eight months nine months I I don&#x27;t know exactly how long. But um you know that uh you know what what Tim Phillips said about him bringing what would be described what Tim Phillips said was alienike technology or at least that implicated uh some programs at NE the Nevada test site which he then understood to you know which he said he could understand why people would think they were you know alienike capabilities.</p>
<p>That was an incredibly surprising uh admission. Uh that really qualified what I already knew to be true based on the tremendous stream of messages and both email and text between my client and SSCI and ERA. &gt;&gt; All right, betterers. Please hit that like button. That really helps out the videos.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button. I&#x27;m trying to get to 100,000 subscribers before the end of the year. All right. So, this is where the story gets even juicier as Ivan&#x27;s about to explain. And even I admit that this is um a crazy part of the story.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve heard such drama uh behind the scenes about a whistleblower. I mean, maybe I have, but this this definitely is a unique uh situation. I mean, listen to what Ivan says. Like I said before, um Tim Phillips, who was the deputy director of Arrow, again, who was no longer with Arrow, but at the time that he said the comments he said he was, and he does accuse this new whistleblower, Michael, of extortion, as Ivan&#x27;s about to explain. And don&#x27;t worry, I have the clip of Mick West and Tim Phillips talking about this, where Ivan is going to get um his story from.</p>
<p>Uh but we&#x27;ll get to that after this clip. uh again of Ivan Hanel uh Luis Alzando&#x27;s lawyer speaking on that UFO podcast about this new UFO whistleblower quote Michael um coming out you know so yeah so it&#x27;s a new guy um he&#x27;s a good person of goodwill uh I think he&#x27;s still trying to to work if he can you know if if the government wants he&#x27;ll certainly try to to work with the American government and and present what he knows he&#x27;s already presented quite a it. Um, again, I don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t qualify, you know, his technology or the information, and I&#x27;ve seen very, frankly, little other than the communications uh uh and, you know, between him and and his group and um and and and the Senate and Arrow, but I will say it&#x27;s substantial and frankly I think he has been the target, which people don&#x27;t realize, of a lot of the comments by even, you know, Senator Rounds and um um uh certainly Tim Phillips and others I think he is implicated. A lot of what they&#x27;re saying resonates with some of the things he he he has going on. So um you know from my point I think he&#x27;s just a good American businessman who is trying who is trying to help and you know and it and it shows you if Arrow treated you know him this way who was just trying to say look I&#x27;ve think I&#x27;ve made some discoveries I don&#x27;t know what this is but you know I found out certain things that are you know have a lot of data behind them.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what they&#x27;ve did to people who don&#x27;t have, you know, any means and are government employees and are just, you know, without representation and and just feeling vulnerable, you know, he it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just horrible, you know. So, um Tim Phillips um you know, I I don&#x27;t know why he got one on a campaign of uh podcast, but certainly it&#x27;s that stream of podcast has seemed to have stopped or been put a stop to. and uh you know he was doing a great job of telling a lot of things and they put a muzzle on him I guess. &gt;&gt; Any time scales on when your client&#x27;s going to come forward publicly? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m hoping in the next couple of weeks. I can&#x27;t give an exact time frame, but I&#x27;m hoping in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Um you know, you never can tell. Maybe if the government comes and works with him, then we&#x27;ll never hear from him again. Uh I don&#x27;t know. Um but but but but I think he, you know, he&#x27;s not a UFO guy. He&#x27;s not an NHI guy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not that he&#x27;s not open to that, but he&#x27;s just a a business person who has a sc, you know, science background along with the family background and um just really came across some very unusual things and has a incredible story to tell. I think that there&#x27;s a lot of uh uh you might describe it as evidence to suggest that there&#x27;s a lot of truth to it. And I&#x27;d like to thank uh Tim Phillips for for helping helping corroborate some things uh inadvertently. So, I I always Thank you, Tim. Good job.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, so let&#x27;s just get to the meat and potatoes here, right? Let&#x27;s show the clip of Mick West and Tim Phillips talking about where this all kind of started. Um, sort of the hoopla. Um, and you know, again, it it it is interesting because I do remember hearing this interview the first time, and I didn&#x27;t really think anything of this part in particular at the time because they didn&#x27;t name who it was, but this is kind of a crazy story. &gt;&gt; I was frustrated by some of the claims made by witnesses um to members of Congress. I I know that uh we had people referred to us.</p>
<p>Um one particular individual um we thought he was extorting us. You know, we we were going to uh &gt;&gt; u pay him for his knowledge or his materials or he was going to take it to a foreign country. It sounded like extortion to us and reported it to our FBI counterparts. And by the way, we actually had at various times FBI um you know agents or analysts who were part of the aeros staff. So we did work very very closely with the FBI.</p>
<p>Um, so &gt;&gt; so that was some like physical material that he had that uh &gt;&gt; it was it was and I well actually went back to members of the of this uh member staff saying they should you know they they should protect the member from this individual. It it wasn&#x27;t fair to him um to give him an audience. I I you know I I am not a medical professional. Um but what I heard um based off common sense I wouldn&#x27;t want him around my family. &gt;&gt; How did he even get into the position to be able to approach you with this type of thing? &gt;&gt; Well we he was referred to us by uh members of this uh members uh staff.</p>
<p>It came to us. &gt;&gt; Okay. And &gt;&gt; we were we were asked to interview and we did and there was concern that uh some of the materials that uh he possessed um could compromise actual programs of record. &gt;&gt; And so look, this is nuts, right? I mean um so it turns out that the guy Tim Phillips was talking about is this whistleblower named Michael who is Ivan&#x27;s client, right? Um, so he was being accused of extortion, extorting the United States government. Now, the story gets even crazier because Michael has come forward um after all of this and kind of like, &quot;Hey, what the f is going on?&quot; You know, he wants to defend his name, which rightfully so, right? So, and he wants to defend his name and rightfully so.</p>
<p>And so he released some statements um online through some podcasters or something. Um and um he basically explains the incident, right, that he first saw, right, that includes photo, video, physical evidence of and then there&#x27;s a statement of him basically saying why he&#x27;s not going to come out anymore and what he thinks is hurting disclosure, right? and what he thinks the government should do about this. And I have to say he makes some really good points. So, we&#x27;re going to go over those statements. But first, I want you to hear from Eric Berles because this is a brand new clip to the story because Eric Berles spoke with this gentleman.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s listen to what Eric Berles had to say about this UFO whistleblower named Michael. &gt;&gt; So, I had kind of two big things fall in my lap last Monday. uh one of them directly involving you. And this was the uh civilian whistleblower who apparently has been in Skiffs uh and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s known anonymously as Michael um but had a closeup encounter um that he filmed on 4K video in uh I think in Witchah, Kansas around 20 years ago. And apparently he was speaking to you as uh my buddy Paulo and I were working on working with Ivan Hanel on getting his statement out about why he doesn&#x27;t want to come forward any longer.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if you could comment on that. Um that is um that that&#x27;s an interesting um individual and and I&#x27;m um I&#x27;m hoping to keep that relationship going and better to get more information. Right now he seems very guarded. Um but um yeah, I don&#x27;t right now I think that um the the problem is he&#x27;s looking for the problem is it&#x27;s complicated things. The fact that he is he owns a private business and he&#x27;s seeking a government contract and it just kind of complicates the whole scenario.</p>
<p>So, the fact that that he&#x27;s not an existing contractor who&#x27;s then bringing forward information, it it it makes it look like he&#x27;s he&#x27;s trying to trying to use it for to get contracts. But, at the end of the day, I I think that he&#x27;s I I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not skeptical in that regard. I&#x27;m just telling you what I&#x27;m having to deal with. I think that he is a um he I think that he&#x27;s a patriot. I think that he&#x27;s someone who wants to protect the interest of the United States.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s he&#x27;s been able to get that this these videos and photos. Um I&#x27;ve only seen one photo and one video. Um, and I will say that whenever I have talked about those photos and and shown them to people that were in the know about about um highly highly classified um um US military um aircraft, the the response was jaw-dropping. People are shocked that that um someone who is an amateur or is not not exactly a an established contractor has was able to gather these photos and videos. So, we&#x27;re I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what the origin is and and figure out how I can work with him and and help him.</p>
<p>And so that I&#x27;m being I&#x27;m trying to be as transparent as possible without without re revealing who he is and revealing too much about what what he has. &gt;&gt; So as you can see, Eric Berles doesn&#x27;t really suspect that he was trying to extort um the United States, right? He was just somebody who wanted a contract with the government. Now what Eric is saying is that there is a little conflict of interest there, right? trying to get a contract and you&#x27;re coming with evidence too at the same time. Maybe this isn&#x27;t the best time to bring that up, right? Essentially, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like Eric thinks that that guy is, you know, doing anything illegal or crazy or whatever and wants to see what he was shown. I mean, in fact, what he showed people left people jaw-dropped, right? This is kind of insane.</p>
<p>But as the story continues, again, these people think that this is all man-made tech, including Michael, for all I know, right? Uh, and everyone he&#x27;s shown it to, but they were so worried that, hey, you captured something America&#x27;s actually working on, we got to silence you, right? And so, Michael&#x27;s going to explain that he was actually cleared by the FBI. He was actually cleared by many investigative bodies and many investigations of any wrongdoing and still went on to testify in skiffs and go behind closed doors and even give um consultation about the New Jersey drone flaps that happened. I mean he&#x27;s been working for this for 2 years. So let&#x27;s get to these statements from Michael. All right.</p>
<p>So this first uh part is going to be Michael&#x27;s encounter that he had that all the hoopla is about. So the exact date I keep because once you have those you can figure out the data link satellite track but it was around Witchah, Kansas 20 plus years ago. The one at the end of the statement that I want to back up with a polygraph is a different one. Both involved a craft hovering less than 50 ft from the ground and we were able to get right up to it. Both were around 10 minutes and the first one lost a piece of craft we recovered which is what allowed this all to happen.</p>
<p>We know the signature we are looking for and we happen to have it. And we happened to have it happen in a business van that involved equipment from a business I own that included K2 meter, the best fleer camera, ultrasonic microphone, and a host of other equipment, including myself and three other people. We had a shot. We took it. 40 foot length, fighter jet size, dark gray that absorbed light.</p>
<p>Sounds just like corona or arching of electrical. probably a sample on YouTube. So, sounds juiced up outside of Witchah, Kansas. Field 3:00 am on way back from long work trip for business. July nice and quiet could hear the crickets.</p>
<p>SSCI one spent two years with lots of skiff meetings. They don&#x27;t want what the military does for proof physical material and GPS coordinates with date and time stamp, data links, photo and video with metadata, tracking radar, and so on. I found plenty that is physics defying but not NHI. So I don&#x27;t share what is US technology publicly. However, as Ivan has seen and we could do some screenshot, there&#x27;s a 2-year record of this.</p>
<p>Not just one gift, several, including secret location meetings. Hundreds of pages of emails and texts back and forth. That&#x27;s the story and why Tim Phillips said what he did. Well, it&#x27;s an interesting take. You know, we got assigned to solve it for SSCI.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s where the physical materials come from. Tim Phillips references. But they didn&#x27;t do their part of agreement with deal. My problem with the word individual in UAPDA and NDAA is them trying to get what I have. That&#x27;s the key.</p>
<p>If they take it from me, it&#x27;s gone. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing now is trying to break it out. But not easy to fight the government and be safe at the same time. As Arrow and SSEI know, I received a death threat from many, including China that came with a video of President Ginping taken from the person next to him with a smartphone to track me by phone and wipe me off face of Earth if I didn&#x27;t work with them. OSI verified it.</p>
<p>This is not the normal alien story. This is high stakes with death on the line. I&#x27;m trying. So, now let&#x27;s get into a statement of why he&#x27;s shying away from public engagement. Background and unique position.</p>
<p>A small number of people in the UAP field may know me, but most do not. My father and I were, to my knowledge, the first and only non-military non-contractor individuals to brief senators and staff inside both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Aeroskiff. SSCI staff could not recall any prior occasion when someone without a security clearance had been admitted to skiff 219 to give such a briefing. Over the course of two years, we participated in multiple skiff meetings, including an emergency session related to the Langley F uh Air Force Base drone incursion. We were invited because we had what they called the goods, photos and videos of black triangles, physical material and technology.</p>
<p>We entered as a business seeking a deal for our portfolio. As Tim Phillips stated, the SSCI chairman even considered sending him to Area 51 in search of comparable technology. We located technology with so-called physics defying characteristics, though we never found aliens or non-human intelligence. The reason the Senate&#x27;s UAP focus has been on drones rather than aliens, unlike the House, is lar is largely due to information we provided, including data links. Number two, initial government engagement.</p>
<p>This began when we attempted to sell directly to military branches, among other things. We informed them we had defeated stealth, including jamming and spoofing counter measures, rendering trillions of dollars in taxpayer funded assets obsolete. They this got their attention especially when we provided evidence. We were investigated by AFOSI, NCIS and the IG of naval intelligence activity, cyber command and others. We cooperated fully including interviews and polygraphs.</p>
<p>Due to jurisdiction due to jurisdictional overlaps, I ended up meeting with top FBI agents and DOJ representatives. The FBI accused me of blackmailing the US government. The DOJ, however, cleared me, affirming my right to sell legally obtained technology. The DoD also stated that the UAP tic tac technology was not their property. That&#x27;s interesting, right? Ross Coloulthard, I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Number three, SSCI involvement and fallout. Poor treatment from government agencies led me to complain to SSCI. Upon hearing UAP and seeing that I had cleared investigations, they invited me to brief them in the skiff, assuring me this would quote take the heat off and protect me from the Invention Secrecy Act. I was told it would end in a deal. This turned out to be false.</p>
<p>According to Tim Phillips, SSCI staff began seeking ways to remove me after obtaining the information they wanted. My promised whistleblower protections were revoked, enabling accusations of extortion which were unfounded. Phillips publicly revealed that I had physical materials despite knowing about credible threats from foreign actors, including a death threat from China verified by OSI. This exposed me and my family to serious danger. I have received no apology or retraction from SSCI or Arrow and advise others not to approach them.</p>
<p>Number four, House engagement. After concluding SSCI members, including Senator Rounds, Cotton, Warner, Moran, and Gillibrand acted in bad faith, I approached the House. For two years, I provided briefings on drone threats, including how the Chinese executed the Langley Air Force Base incursion without detection or interception. Despite this, the House focused on unverified NHI and alien claims, holding hearings without requiring proof. This shift has damaged the credibility of the UAP discussion.</p>
<p>Number five, recommendations for credibility. The UAP community and Congress must change course if they want to be taken seriously. Require government level polygraph testing for anyone providing testimony, including whistleblowers, journalists, and self-proclaimed experts. Avoid sensational, unprovable claims about NHI or alien encounters. Reset all public statements to zero and rebuild with verifiable polygraph evidence.</p>
<p>Apply the same standards to well-known figures like David Grush or Bob Lazar without public shaming for failure but with transparency. Subject expert witnesses to the same rigor including GPS/timestamp data and monitored experiments. Without these measures, the next hearing risk being the last credible opportunity for decades. Number six, my position. I&#x27;m willing to provide SSCI and Arrow the same GPS coordinates, date, and time stamp I gave previously, documenting a UAP I observed hovering less than 50 feet away for 10 minutes along with the witness willing to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>This whistleblower has been talking to the SSCI and Mike rounds and others. Here are screenshots. All right, so look, I&#x27;m going to put a link in the description to this article and it includes some screenshots of emails and this that and the other. So, please feel free to go check it out along with links to everything else. But again, this is a fascinating story.</p>
<p>And this whistleblower named Michael is basically saying there&#x27;s no aliens or NHI what he found, right? But he has some physi physical material, but it&#x27;s I guess it&#x27;s been people thought it was alien, right? So, I don&#x27;t know. This is very interesting. So, is he a UFO whistleblower or is he just a whistleblower for what exactly? I I guess I&#x27;m still a little even confused on that. Um, so let me know in the comments u what y&#x27;all think about this story. And I guarantee there is way more to come with this.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;ll have to wait and see. Could he still be one of these people that testifies at the September 9th hearing? I don&#x27;t know. based off this statement he released, it&#x27;s not looking good. But it would be interesting for him to give an interview in more details. And if he was unfoundedly accused of extortion against the United States, that&#x27;s messed up.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s really messed up for him and his family. Um, I got to say, forget UFOs, ali what are we doing? That that is just not cool. Um, so but I can also understand the part about, hey, you&#x27;re trying to get a contract while trying to testify and give testimony and, you know, maybe this isn&#x27;t the best time. I can see the conflict of interest there, too. So, sounds like a complicated web, as always.</p>
<p>So, anyway, all right. Let me know what you guys think down below. We&#x27;ll see you on the next one. Remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace.</p>
