            <p>David grush Robert Jacobs David fraver Robert Salis Michael Herrera all UFO whistleblowers who have sworn their testimony before Congress testified to Arrow or signed legal affidavits to swear in their statements Bob Lazar Mark mccandlish Bill U house Boyd Bushman all UFO whistleblowers with astounding claims persisting throughout the decades but with no real legal testimony or evidence to back them up the world has seen Myriad whistleblowers since the 1940s and the nine men I just mentioned are just a drop in the bucket though these whistleblowers vary greatly in credibility and believability all of these men and women deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens regardless of if they are of Ironclad reputation and accomplishments like grush and fraver possess testimonies sworn into legal record like Salis and USMC vet Michael Herrera or claims that are unverifiable yet intriguing but have never been sworn in under legal testimony like Li are and Bushman who knows what whistleblowers with sobering and real testimonies have been overlooked or buried in the annals of UFO lore who knows what whistleblowers may give us a peak behind the veil to get a glimpse at the shadowy program that has likely been operating since at least 1947 hey guys it&#x27;s UAP gerb and join me today as I begin part one of an exciting ongoing series studying UFO whistleblowers throughout history this series will bring light to lesser-known whistleblowers I find worthy of discussing and studying we will investigate the person making the claims and analyze the context of their claims to see if we can start making heads or tales of the astonishing and perplexing stories of firsthand encounters with UAP we all know the story of the Roswell crash of 1947 many including myself consider this the inflection point the Nexus of secret UFO study and crash retrieval and reverse engineering efforts what can you tell me about the Roswell craft fortunately the those details uh were not approved for me to talk about right now everyone knows the general story of Roswell but here is a quick refresher and I do mean quick because Roswell is one of the most fascinating stories in human history and deserves at least a one to 2hour video on its investigation on July 1st through the 3rd 1947 UFOs were detected on radar from White Sand&#x27;s Missile Range which had been testing nuclear weapons since 1946 on July 4th a UFO disappears off radar scope this is likely the crash date the following day July 5th the area of North Roswell is quarantined guards were stationed north of town on Highway 285 blocking roads this same day debris and bodies were shipped out of Roswell Hangar 84 to either right Pat or Fort wor North Texas the following day Rancher ma Brazzle takes a box of debris into his local sheriff&#x27;s office Brazzle had discovered a wreckage field on Foster Ranch 75 M north of Roswell intelligence officer Jesse Marcel senior was dispatched to observe and recover the wreckage and it is crucial to note here the existence of two separate locations from Roswell this is always a misconception I see the debris feeli discovered by bra and investigated by Marcel was not the location where the craft and bodies were allegedly recovered the debris field was 3.4 Mi long and 300 ft wide and consisted solely of craft ejecta strange metallic material was discovered that was almost massless yet retained shape and showed resistance to blunt and sheer trauma I highly recommend my battel video as this wreckage was likely studied by battel Memorial Institute the second location just north of Roswell was kept far more under wraps and there&#x27;s far more secrecy around this location anyways Marcel loaded wreckage onto a military Jeep and on the way home to the Roswell Army Airfield showed his family pieces of the wreckage including his son Jesse Marcel Jr on July 8th in a press conference mandated by Colonel William Blanchard and confirmed by the 509th Bomb Group public relations officer Lieutenant Walter hot the raaf revealed a flying disc crashed and was in Air Force possession the same day headlines were made stating raaf captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell region that same day the Roswell story is killed General Roger Ry ordered a retraction to the saucer news Shifting the story to a recovered weather balloon Marcel was photographed in ramy&#x27;s office with aluminum foil not recovered material for press purposes Marcel himself later admitted to this in a 1978 interview with the legendary Stanton Freeman where he revealed He was ordered to participate in a coverup Marcel ordered his family not to talk about the wreckage Blanchard goes on leave Brazzle disappears and Marcel moves to Fort Worth nobody could be contacted about the events and the story is killed for decades so where does Lieutenant Walter hot of the 509th Bomb Group fit into this as a whistleblower well first let&#x27;s start with his credentials during World War II hot was a Bombadier who flew 35 missions in Japan he participated in A- bomb testing in bikini atoli and served in the 59th Atomic Bomb Group at Roswell Army Airfield at the time of the alleged crash in 1947 an interesting fact his group The 509th was the Air Force Wing that dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki for years after the event and Jesse Marcel&#x27;s admitted coverup in 1978 Hot stayed silent it wasn&#x27;t until the early &#x27;90s he began speaking up on May 14th 1993 hot wrote and signed an official affid davit discussing his experience at Roswell he wanted put into a press release when the colonel tells the first lieutenant almost Verbatim what he wants in a press release guess what he gets you don&#x27;t argue with him and say oh I think it&#x27; sound better if we said it this way or the next way the answer to all was yes sir so what exactly did the press release say in essence it was very simple to the effect that we had in our possession of flying saucer it was found on a ranch up north of Roswell it was being flown to General ry&#x27;s office here hot discusses how Colonel blanchford the base commander called Walter at raaf to say he had in his possession a flying saucer or parts from a disc he stated these pieces came from a ranch Northwest of Roswell and intelligence officer Jesse Marcel would fly the materials to Fort Worth information that I got was given to me almost verbatim by Colonel Blanchard and he WR off of scratch pad that he had in front of him uh what he was saying to me and I was writing it down uh and after we got all through with it I kind of AED and he said I want you to give it to the local newspapers and radio stations and do it post haste and all he got in reply was a yes sir and away I went I meant that they put all the hunks and pieces in a I think it was at that time oh c54 aircraft that they loaded up primarily with uh the material and that airplane was flown the material was not flown so hot says that material were loaded into aircraft the aircraft took off but the material did not also blanchford ordered hot to write a news release about the operation to be delivered to two radio stations in Roswell and both of the newspapers The Daily Record and the dispatch newspapers hot was stunned by the following retraction and changing of the story to a weather balloon by General Roger Remy and believed there was no chance neither blanchford nor Marcel mistook the wreckage for a weather balloon Marcel even admitted his his involvement like I stated earlier and he also did privately to Walter in 1980 interestingly enough we can look at the signed affidavit made by Arthur McQuitty the managing editor of the Roswell morning dispatch at the time of the incident mcquiddy here confirms the delivery of the press release by hot and the subsequent call made from the raaf saying the release was incorrect and the wreckage was that of a recovered balloon McQuitty was also good friends with colonel blanchford and months after the event the colonel told the editor quote I will tell you this and nothing more the stuff I saw I&#x27;ve never seen any place else in my life oh and by the way we do have even more legal affidavits here such as from Fort Worth Army Airfield Colonel Thomas J dubos who confirmed the materials shown with Jesse Marcel and ramy&#x27;s office were indeed a weather balloon used as a cover story in addition to this he states he was in charge of arranging the requested materials be sent from raaf to Fort Worth which were then sent on to General chidlaw at right field shockingly this is not the only affidavit signed and written by hot meaning maybe he didn&#x27;t tell all of his story here in the early &#x27;90s in 2002 hod completed another legal document to be released 2 years after his death after his passing in 2005 2007 saw the release of hot&#x27;s final statements here hot expands on his firsthand encounters with the Roswell incident on the morning of July 8th Walter attended the staff meeting with Colonel blanchford General Ramy and Chief of Staff Colonel dubos among others the topic of this discussion was the freshly discovered debris field found 75 Mi Northwest of Roswell and the primary site 40 m north of town samples of wreckage were passed around the meeting and here hot once again confirms the lightweight metallic alloy with shape retention abilities this time featuring some strange markings these markings were actually discussed by Marcel Senor and his son who saw the wreckage his father brought home Jesse Marcel Jr the team did not know whether or not to go public with the findings General Ramy proposed a plan to divert attention away from the more important site just north of town the craft site by drawing much more attention to the debris field at 9:30 a.m. blanchford dictated the press release about a flying disc to hot before leaving the base blanchfield took the 509th lieutenant to building 84 a b29 hanger that was under heavy guard control on both the interior and exterior once inside hot was allowed to view what had been recovered just north of town he observed an egg-shaped craft 12 to 15 ft in length and 6 feet in diameter with a metallic surface the craft had no windows Port holes Wings landing gear or tail section and this description reminds me very closely of The Craft as described by arow whistleblower Eric Taber that was stored in Area 51 Additionally the lieutenant saw a couple bodies under a canvas tarp only the heads were visible and Walter could make out no features due to the poor lining but the bodies were the size of a 10-year-old child roughly 4 ft high with larger than normal heads a temporary morg here was set up and in another video I will cover the sworn statements of this Roswell mortician and finally hot reiterates what was told to him by Marcel that the officer took pieces of the wreckage to General ramy&#x27;s office and Upon returning from a map room discovering balsawood and foil from a weather balloon and radar kite why Walter never revealed this story earlier well he said he swore to Blanchard he would never reveal what he saw in his life time and now we get on to another former USG military personnel Brigadier General Steven lovkin who appeared on Steven Greer&#x27;s 2001 disclosure project now don&#x27;t be swooning over the title brigadier general just yet folks lovkin was a quote unquote Brigadier General in the North Carolina State guard a volunteer militia with no official military standing so Greer embellished lovekins credentials or didn&#x27;t vet this through enough however lovekin did enter the Army in 1958 and joined the pentagon&#x27;s radio frequency engineering office Steven then went on to the White House Army signaling agency in 1959 as a technical specialist lovekin served in both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations with an above toop secret clearance also from multiple independent sources including the esteemed euphology just Joe margia lovkin was also an attendee to the 1998 briefing with Dr Greer Dr Mitchell rear Admiral Thomas Wilson Commander will Miller and others this meeting featured in The Wilson Davis memo was confirmed by Wilson himself to be true if you don&#x27;t know about the WD memo this was the first video I ever made and what I considered to be one of the most important documents of all time link to this video will be in the description so let&#x27;s start to look at an analyze some of lovekins claims I uh learned a lot about Project Blue Book uh Blue Book was discussed quite openly in the office uh sections of Blue Book were open for discussion and uh then there were other matters as well that that were brought to uh our attention one afternoon when lovekins work at the White House Army signaling agency dealt with codebreaking in the process he learned much about the ongoing Blue Book he States quote the findings that were put in there were highly scientific they were highly gone over by the people that knew what they wanted to put in there this information was information that would never get out to anyone else but it was designed for the use of particular military personnel what was there was extremely exact and scientific uh you saw an awful lot you saw a lot of pictures um most of the pictures we have seen duplicates of today uh some were the pictures that I saw were I think uh maybe a little bit better they were taken by uh Air Force pilots as well pictures of of the UFOs yes so they actually had pictures of UFOs in these Oh indeed they did yes not only the Air Force but but uh some were taken by civilian Pilots uh some were taken by uh uh Marine aircore uh Pilots uh this and and some were foreign quote I would say there were probably between two and 300 cases of lock on and that&#x27;s why those cases were in there because they were authentic end quote interesting to me is how all of this particular language for particular Personnel never seemed to make it into the official Declassified Project Blue book reports equally as interesting are the alleged photos that along with numerous cases were omitted from Blue Book the lockon statement is additionally accurate if you remember from my video on the history of the UFO stigma major hecta quintonia lied to Congress that Bluebook uncovered zero radar lock on cases fortunately this statement was later on corrected by the infamous J Allen heinik who supplied multiple such radar identification cases and what gives lovekin some more credibility to me is his mention of the Air Force when discussing Blue Book he States quote the Air Force at that time was very very much concerned with Blue Book and there were strict regulations involving anything that had to do with reporting of UFOs or talking about a UFO if you wanted to ruin your career it was explained to us the thing that would do this fastest was to talk about UFOs end quote as someone who talks every video now about USAF reg 200-2 I find it admirable and interesting lovekin makes this connection I know what you&#x27;re thinking guys gerb we all know Blue Book was a front you talk about it in every single video you make everyone knows that scientific evidence was compartmented outside of Blue Book is this all lovein has to offer well there&#x27;s a reason I put lovekin here in the same video with Walter hot during a meeting discussing Blue Book materials lovkin claimed one Colonel Hollard which may be a Greer misspelling of hollow guard or Hollow Berg brought out a metallic piece similar to a yard stick the metal had encryption on it described by hird as symbols of struction so important they can keep the military working on them at a consistent basis they went on to further explain that that this was the material that had come from uh the New Mexico crash in 1947 well he said it would had been taken from one of the craft that had uh crashed in uh in New Mexico and that had been taken from a box of materials that the military was working on uh didn&#x27;t use the word uh reverse engineering at that time but it was some something similar to the reverse engineering anybody who knows the Roswell story and now the Whistleblower Walter hot knows the infamous encrypted quote ibeam the piece Jesse Marcel senior showed his son this famous material from the alleged crash has actually been claimed to have been viewed by many people and I encourage you to take a dive in the video description will be a link to all witness accounts but that&#x27;s not all lovkin had to say about Roswell he even comments on one of the most fascinating yet contentious aspects of the case bodies and the next day it was discussed again they did discuss the fact that there were bodies extraterrestrial extraterrestrial bodies yes um there were either three or five and and and they didn&#x27;t even know at that point uh because some of the uh some of the information that they had gotten apparently was was incomplete but three or five stands out in my mind as as the number that uh that were taken uh they were one was alive partially alive at the time that this happened our military organization today Bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea in 1961 president Dwight D Eisenhower gave the forever famous speech warning about the dangers of the military-industrial complex I and I&#x27;m sure many other UFO researchers have wondered if he was partly referring to the Legacy UFO programs here the program grush speaks of that Admiral Wilson almost uncovered the program that has been attempting to reverse engineer and recover UFO since at least Roswell in 1947 Eisenhower&#x27;s connections to UFO lore are legendary after all the alleged mj12 documents State the shadowy group reported to Truman and Eisenhower and we cannot forget the astonishing story of Eisenhower meeting with a group of extraterrestrials after their landing at Hollowman Air Force Base in 1954 The Story Goes Eisenhower made an agreement with these being I&#x27;ve yet to dive too much into this alleged encounter between a president and extraterrestrials but was this what grush was referring to when he said deals had been made with nhi and it&#x27;s quite clear that you&#x27;re talking about agreements between America and non-human intelligences have we made agreements with non-human intelligences that&#x27;s the kind of information I really hope National leadership is able to get to the bottom of I need to pin you down on this are there agreements between non-human intelligences and the American government I think that&#x27;s a question that I would like to know all the detail of as well there are more sobering stories of Eisenhower being read into the current estimates of the UFO phenomenon during his presidency but losing control this is the estimated time where the program Broke Free of government and congressional oversight and this seems to be the stance that lovein takes and he can offer some valuable context here so I&#x27;m going to let this short clip play in its entirety the whole process of dealing with with uh with the UFO phenomenon uh could not be handled anymore by one agency and so in order to keep it alive and I guess as cheaply as possible it was it was given to various incy parts of the government to work on and I guess they thought that they could they could also keep the intelligence uh Factor as as secret as possible by by giving little a agencies a little bit here and a little bit there and then often times is done with with matters like this but but what happened was Eisenhower got sold out uh the without him knowing it uh he lost control of of uh of what was going on with with h the entire I think with the entire UFO situation but I think he was telling us the military industrial complex will stick you in the back uh if if you are not totally Vigilant and and um I think he felt like he had not been Vigilant I think he felt like he trusted too many people and uh and Eisenhower was a trusting man he was a good man um and I think uh I think that he realized that all of a sudden this this this matter is is going into uh into the control of Corporations uh that uh uh that could very well be uh used uh in in detriment to this country I think the the frustration from what I can remember went on for months um he uh he uh realized that he was losing control he realized that this this the phenomenon of of uh of whatever it was that uh that we were faced with uh was not going to be in the best hands and that that those were the as far as I can remember that was the expression that was used it&#x27;s not going to be in the best hands in a separate interview with author Grant Cameron lovkin stated he attended Camp David with Eisenhower and other staff on multiple occasions although just a sergeant at the time Stefan noted the good nature of Eisenhower who made sure to know the name of each and every person one night lovkin overheard the president on a telephone call began to discuss the 1952 UFOs over Washington DC incident apparently this wasn&#x27;t a rare occasion as UFOs were quote a very very important concern of his end quote Eisenhower was additionally concerned about losing control over the military-industrial complex lovkin States the president began being kept out of information regarding UAP later in his term in his disclosure project interview lovkin also comments on UFO&#x27;s being a career killer to speak about openly and this is just the tip of the iceberg an older officer involved with the CIA and Dia told him uncovering Revelations about the phenomen on could lead to somebody being erased he said those threats have been made and carried out he said those threats started uh way back in 1947 uh the Army was given uh uh the Air Force excuse me was given the uh uh absolute control over how to handle this this being the biggest um the biggest security situation that uh that this country has ever dealt with I guess fear has done it I don&#x27;t care what kind of a person you are I don&#x27;t care how strong or courageous you are it would be a very fearful situation because from what Matt said he said they&#x27;ll uh he said they&#x27;ll go after not only you he said they&#x27;ll go after your family those were his words have people been killed to protect the secret uh based on the people I talked to uh that was an ongoing uh concern yeah unfortunately I&#x27;ve heard some really unamerican things I don&#x27;t want to repeat right now so you have a strong suspicion that people have been murdered to protect the SEC over the years yeah hey guys thank you so much for joining me today as I start this new series diving into UFO whistleblowers and their claims let me get something out of the way I&#x27;m sorry for the disheveled appearance yesterday May 4th I tested for my purple belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and uh along the way I took some injuries including a pretty nasty eye poke so I&#x27;m just thankful I can see out of this eye but I was really inspired to cover these two men Walter hot and Steven lovkin Steven Stefan I know I probably got it wrong so I&#x27;m sorry let me have it in the comments I I know I mispronounce things every single video but I wanted to cover these two men due to the relevancy of their claims I stay away from studing my personal opinion most of the time until the end of the videos such as here but um I personally do believe that 1947 Roswell New Mexico some sort of non-human intelligence craft crashed I think this is the Nexus of reverse engineering programs possibly magenta Italy earlier but maybe the program wasn&#x27;t so condensed and compartmentalized and efficient then but I think Roswell is one of the largest incidents in UFO history and I think hot is one of the best whistleblowers and people to discuss his experience with this with Blanchard with General Remy because as everybody knows General Ry the man who needed to kill the Roswell story is also the same general who gave the press release with General Samford in 1952 following the UFOs over Washington DC so just a a a relevant whistleblower relevant case to talk about so you can tell by the shirt uh very passionate about Roswell and Steven lovkin not only does he talk more about Roswell but but I think he has a lot of keen insights to offer about kind of where this program started to spiral out this Legacy program grush talks about and some of the crimes they&#x27;ve committed including murder and not just attacking people but attacking their family as well I think it&#x27;s pretty probable that around the 1960s with Dwight D Eisenhower private corporations and and parts of the Legacy program being in the private sector and funded through private corporations and irra really started to break away in the&#x27; 60s I believe this is when Congressional and presidential oversight were lost with the program so I personally find lovkin quite credible the biggest stain here of course is the Brigadier General thing for a volunteer militia uh I really wish Steven Greer wouldn&#x27;t have included that in the video because even the slightest bit of research you can kind of uh tell that that&#x27;s a little bit of an embellishment so that&#x27;s definitely a little bit of a credibility stain on his case but I I thought these two whistleblowers were the perfect two people to kind of get our feet wet and get started in the future we will have whistleblowers uh crash retrieval whistleblowers reverse engineering whistleblowers uh just sighting whistleblowers radar whistleblowers all types of whistleblowers you can imagine I but I could make a 20 part series on this with two to three people per so again guys thank you so much for joining please remember to like And subscribe for all my crew that watches the UFC last night UFC 301 went down EG got robbed he won rounds 23 and four round five was the swing round Pantoja took overall great card happy to see Anthony Smith back always like watching him win because he is the best fighter on paper but thank you so much guys and I will catch everybody on the next show</p>
