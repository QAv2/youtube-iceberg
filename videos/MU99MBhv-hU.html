            <p>We have chips that uh generate uh three and a half volt capacitive discharges in dark RF shielded enclosures. Uh and then we have chips that now exhibit steadystate current uh and voltage over long periods of time. Uh and so we are working to we are working to improve performance such that we have chips you know about the size of your pinky nail uh 5mm x 5 millimeter that uh generate um 1 and a half volts and 25 micro amps. And so you know you might think golly that&#x27;s that&#x27;s not a lot of power. Well the the beauty of the last 1015 years is that the low power electronics market has exploded.</p>
<p>And so there are tons and tons and tons of applications for us to to to go after uh with a chip like that. So with that kind of power level, we can run uh a tire pressure monitor system, uh a a glucose monitor, a remote control, a key fob, an Apple Air Tag, um Internet of Things device, uh photoic displays on grocery stores, NFC&#x27;s on your credit card, um RFI, I could just continue to go on. There&#x27;s</p>
