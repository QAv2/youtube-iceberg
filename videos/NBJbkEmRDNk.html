            <p>solving the mystery of huntsville&#x27;s brilliant anti-gravity scientist Dr ningling son ningle son talks about her mom&#x27;s career in Legacy along with the internet&#x27;s obsession with her disappearance so she when did she disappear I&#x27;s see she C the papers and 93 hold on right there stop right there in the late 90s she claimed to have created anti-gravity devices that were fully functional and this was big news in both scientific journals and Main mainstream press in 1997 Dr Lee continued to expand on her concept and conduct more experiments she published papers describing the anonymous anomalous weight changes in objects suspected over a rotating superconductor to say her work to referred to as taming gravity could change the world as an understatement taming gravity would drastically change the way we transport on every level humans could travel the world at ease and we could finally get our hands on those sweet hoverboards from Back to the Future so did she really do it so what happened to her in 99 Lee left UAH to start her own company AC gravity and commercialized a device based on her theories oh you [ __ ] up lady her colleagues obviously believed in her work as a chair of uh&#x27;s physics department Larry SMY uh also Departed the university to join her public record show that in 2001 the US Department of Defense gave AC gravity a grant for $448,900 to research and Technology however these result results were never published in fact Dr Lee never published anything again even though the business license for AC gravity was updated yearly through 2018 there&#x27;s no record of any further work done by the Company Lee&#x27;s career after 2002 is a subject of great mystery barely sociable research turned up a document showing that she gave a presentation at the 2003 miter conference titled measurability of AC gravity Fields the miter Corporation challenges federally funded research for excuse me manages feder funded research for several US Agencies at the conference she presented along with a Redstone Arsenal official from US Army Aviation Missile Command meaning that her research was still being conducted up to that point so where did she take off when did she disappear say she they think she went to China this kind goes on they don&#x27;t this is a bunch of like they&#x27;re not really sure and then in 2021 so it&#x27;s like two years ago three years look at this though an obituary popped up an obituary on a a funeral home in just outside of Birmingham where she was like with this where she was and it didn&#x27;t say anything about her disappearance um an obituary</p>
