            <p>but the average one with this inefficiencies and all is about four it puts out about four times as much actual energy delivered in you know heating the air or pumping the air or whatever or cooling the air as you have to physically put in in electromagnetic form it gets the rest of it by compressing the air and taking out the energy out of the out of the out of its external environment it&#x27;s an open system perfectly permitted to do cop1 the only reason we don&#x27;t close loop heat pumps and self power our homes is because they&#x27;re diabolically designed so you can&#x27;t have a high efficiency uh process you got to have the low efficien they been high efficiencies when patented and they disappear because when it cools off out there bingo now you back on Resistance heating they lose so much efficiency you can&#x27;t get anything out of them you got to go to a resistor so now you burn power everything has been designed to keep that power meter on your house and keep that uh gas pump meter on your gas pump and keep you out of an electric car doesn&#x27;t have to be designed that way but it&#x27;s been designed that way deliberately now the electrical engineers don&#x27;t know it the electrical engineer doesn&#x27;t even know about the heavy side Theory it&#x27;s a very rare one that has ever read the original papers in the first place and it didn&#x27;t pay any attention to the fact there&#x27;s a hell of a lot more energy coming out of the the terminals of a battery or generator than what we&#x27;re putting in the shaft or the chemical energy we expended it never registered now that&#x27;s appalling after 100 years over 100 1880s it&#x27;s appalling why is not the National Science Foundation reacting to this I don&#x27;t know why is not the National Academy of Science well for one thing you get it&#x27;s prestigious you get elected to the National Academy of Sciences and you&#x27;re not fixing to pull the rug out from under your prestige and and what you&#x27;ve done no way you&#x27;re going to see it&#x27;s done a little better commend the young guys on doing better research make a little more efficient but you&#x27;re not going to go throw out the whole system and start a new one that&#x27;s the problem we have now really a it&#x27;s not diabolical it&#x27;s it&#x27;s honest but what it is is the whole scientific Community is you know the bulk of it is dedicated to maintaining the status quo and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with us we&#x27;re still using an archaic science we&#x27;re still affecting what the chemist is allowed to do because we&#x27;re giving them a U1 model and we&#x27;re teaching them U1 electr he never heard most of them of these higher Symmetry electromagnetics and there certainly I don&#x27;t know of any chemical textbooks using them there should be they&#x27;ve been around a long time why are we not funding deliberate research to get outside the box to get outside the present model so we can get new chemistry we can get marvelous advances in chemistry such as this thing why aren&#x27;t we doing that I don&#x27;t know because we upset somebody&#x27;s Rice Bowl when we do and they don&#x27;t want their rice bows upset that&#x27;s basically what it&#x27;s all about yeah we&#x27;re getting it in droves I give you one more thing and then this will be over when you deal with the super system you now have to understand engines I&#x27;m going to start in general relativity in general relativity if I change the local energy density of the vacuum in any form whether it&#x27;s mass or whatever any form of energy that I change the energy density of this local space right here this little position I immediately have a curvature of SpaceTime that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s modeled I&#x27;m talking about a model now curvature SpaceTime is not just an etheric kind of idea that&#x27;ll go away and not bite you it&#x27;s a very active Dynamic thing SpaceTime is considered to be the active thing and I&#x27;m glad it is because time is the part of it that&#x27;s really active giving us all the energy so they got it they got it in there but they called it SpaceTime they call the part that isn&#x27;t changing really from the repeated observation but the part that is so but once I have a curvature of SpaceTime I now have quot Wheeler&#x27;s principle if I change the mass energy they speak of the energy in the mass rather than the mass if I change the mass energy in density I change SpaceTime I affect space time I cannot avoid that interaction it&#x27;s absolutely automatic now if I change the SpaceTime curve and there a mass sitting there I affect the mass and I change the mass now you can get new mass in a curved SpaceTime a fullon has mass the fullon interactions with that mass now can add mass or subtract Mass you get my drift you can have in this if I take the exact template the exact forms of all the Dynamics and all the curvatures I call that a template and that and the Dynamics I call that an engine because if I change the space time itself which I can do electromagnetically with these higher symmetry electrod I can&#x27;t do it with U1 cuz it assumes a flat space time don&#x27;t have an engine but if I use one of the others I can have an engine I can make it in SpaceTime without a piece of mass even there then I can bring in a piece of mask and it&#x27;ll baby work on that dude until that mass changes to where how it would affect SpaceTime fits that curvature and that curvature working on it fits what it is till that balance occurs between curve space time and that the engine works forever and you don&#x27;t have to provide any energy from it he takes it from the old Universe FaceTime itself so you must understand the engine concept now that I&#x27;m talking about the super system I have engines now the engines exist in the vacuum I don&#x27;t have a linear vacuum I have structures in the vacuum which will work on those charges move them around change your charge change a negative charge into a positive Char all kinds of things now the lab Observer looking from his flat SpaceTime at that is going to see the intersection in flat that SpaceTime of that thing you&#x27;re not going to see that thing in curve SpaceTime if I started with a standard set of something that I can model in a relatively flat SpaceTime and I make a peak in it somewhere where it violates at now if I change this whole thing I still got my Peak I didn&#x27;t change what I started from so you will recognize in your chemicals and your molecules that you form you will recognize the Peaks of certain things that well it&#x27;s just sulfuric acid no it&#x27;s not it would be sulfuric acid if you unink to the SpaceTime got rid of the engine but as long as that engine is residing in that set of uh atoms and all making up that molecule you do not have to have just the model that exists in in the normal stuff for example what would be unstable in equilibrium conditions this is not equilibrium curved SpaceTime is a broken equilibrium a very fundamental one and you do not have to have what you have in the equilibrium conditions and it can be stable as long as that curved space time is stable the business of charging one in the time domain you can have it charge for an awful long time you can just hold that and stay there and sit on the shelf and all this it doesn&#x27;t have to Decay when it does Decay it decays very slowly usually unless you take special measures to convert it but yes what you&#x27;re doing is really using engines now it can be modeled it can be accurately expressed including the exact molecule you form if we change the chemistry to add engines to add curved space times to add active vacuum going on all at the time if you get a balance between the stuff coming out of the vacuum and the stuff coming from SpaceTime that the only place there in equilibrium is where this crazy molecule exists that molecule will exist it&#x27;ll lock in you see what I mean you got yourself a a a a symmetrical condition but look at the Symmetry between curve space time and the vacuum it&#x27;s not the Symmetry that we normally look at forget the SpaceTime and forget the vacuum look at three space we&#x27;re not look at in three space we&#x27;re in four dimensions or if you want to you can be in 11 to 12 depends on what you want to use to model it so you can have a molecule which is absolutely unstable in the present situation present model would be totally un stable but if you have violated that model and you have achieved a balance between these other two components of the super system then you can lock it in stability and what the guy in the lab will see would be a terribly unstable condition it will not be unstable now he&#x27;s not wrong he just hasn&#x27;t realized that he&#x27;s wrong in his model he would be correct if you were using the situation described in his model assumed in his model the background conditions the initial conditions and all that automatically assumed in his model if you were applying those then you could not be doing this and he would be right since you are not using those conditions you have deliberately changed them by adding an engine making an engine once you have the balanced engine between the time domain the curvature SpaceTime actually the time domain in the curved SpaceTime and the interaction from the vacuum once you have a balanced equilibrium there that will hold that state even though it would be normally unstable it it be just stable as a rock under its conditions that is a special form of symmetry not in three space where the the normal chemist is looking between the SpaceTime curve space time itself and the local vacum</p>
