            <p>hello yours it&#x27;s a hot sunny day I have to admit and today i will describe a little bit more actual turbine now it&#x27;s almost a year that passed after i install it the complete set up here and we&#x27;re in it works perfectly fine and for i will describe more in details the parts of the turbine which have to be maintained and which have and how it&#x27;s everything assembled together see more in detail here as you can see i will i can turn on i will turn around the camera i live on the hill and this is important if you wanna get as much as possible let me turn the camera so if you see I live on the hills yeah very hot sunny day like 32 degrees and here is my turbine how it works really well but now it&#x27;s there is no wind and let&#x27;s right let&#x27;s start from this mode yeah this is something which we need for for the project so so this over here this is the mold for fixing the vinings so did their correctly 120 degrees between each each third yeah and why do we need to prepare such construction such construction is important so that because the big deal is geometry yeah you have to respect the geometry of the three-phase system and so that you can fix the windings properly we have to prepare such mold yeah so our windings will fit exactly around this mod this with these small hammers are the same as in the project i will put the vinings around each of these and then we&#x27;ll and then what we do then then we need to connect the coils down with the wires each each each third yeah each second nine of them each second will we will connect mutually and then when it&#x27;s finished this this should be a solid construction and they should not move but if you have thin wire so if you have the coil with thin wire let&#x27;s say one square millimeter then it&#x27;s important that you after you put all these coils on this mold you have to usually connect them with the rope with some ropes that this setup does not fall apart after we put it into the mall for the pouring of the epoxy resin to make it a hard stator so if you have a thin wire you have to when you have the coils around it on this small mode you have to interconnect them with the ropes so that&#x27;s how construction will still stay solid before putting it to the mold for pouring the the mold yeah so and then what we get in this is the the what we get after we go after we make this this is the structure of the epoxy resin and inside our coil cell 9 totally I think nine or twelve coils let me check one two three four five six seven eight nine nine coins sorry totally nine coils and it&#x27;s very solid you can see it is it is very solid like a stone yeah and about about these connectors you actually don&#x27;t need even did this ones you can just stay it can stay inside of the mold inside of the epoxy resin and you just need the one cable you even don&#x27;t need this connectors over here which is you just can connect inside of the mold and leave the cable outside with three wires and this is all what you need this is all what you need to have a have finished stator and how does it look like over here so if you can see this is this is the same structure but we have also the magnet here the magnets are over here and this is the plates rotor plates this is these are the connectors if I go over here you will see that on this the cable is going only out there is no there is no connectors like I show you on the floor a little bit earlier yeah so everything can go to the table just can able cables connected to connector and then you extend it to your your other side and this is the complete structure if you can see it yeah it looks it looks fine after a year period of time it looks really fine I have to make and also about the the column or the support for the you can build such similar construction because it it is usable and it&#x27;s not not high like to meet us maybe from the floor even less and this is it I wanted to describe you so this structure over here this is the mode for the fixing of the coils and what you get when you put this coil in the epoxy resin to get a solid structure of the stator this is all so what can I say the the generator works really fine after year year has passed and I hope it in the future it will last for several years without necessary investments or replacement of the wings or something things are really saw it happen nothing in a year and the winds are pretty much strong on these hills you can see it&#x27;s a hill and turn the other side the forest it&#x27;s a hill and it works really fine again thank you for watching if any questions if you have a special request about some part of the turbine especially the people who wants to buy the project to know exactly what to fit and how to fit it please respond into replay leave a comment and I will try to respond it when i get the time frame thank you very much bye bye</p>
