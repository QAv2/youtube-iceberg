            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>this episode of the wi files is brought to you by rocket money for decades we&#x27;ve heard about the catastrophic effects of fossil fuel pollution and for just as long I&#x27;ve been hearing that global warming is a myth the two sides are constantly at each other&#x27;s throats but it&#x27;s a fight that&#x27;s completely unnecessary the technology to create unlimited clean free energy has existed for over a 100 years dozens perhaps hundreds of inventors have created machines that pull energy out of thin air machines that could defy gravity levitate and fly machines that bend the fabric of SpaceTime itself these machines sound not just like science fiction they sound like magic so where are these magical devices well when the inventors patented and publicized their technology they performed another magic trick they disappeared [Music] I&#x27;m not sure this was such a good idea cubin I got to use the company credit card again it&#x27;s an emergency no hello how are you oh I&#x27;m sorry how rude of me hello human how are you are you having a good day today well I was until you company credit card now St too sweet why do you need my credit card the last time you used it Beaver lotion showed up on my statement that was a hard conversation with the the wife well excuse me the Beaver Brothers light their fur to be shiny and luxurious anyway I put all my subscriptions on One credit card and now I&#x27;m maxed out I need some scratch because I promis scy I&#x27;d take her to the sir hump&#x27;s lot concert tonight she loves baby gut hump I don&#x27;t even want to how many subscriptions do you have uh let&#x27;s see I got the fin flick uh fin Flix plus Blowfish Prime uh camel humps at doc Don&#x27;t Tell G about that one yeah I&#x27;m going to pretend you never said that the fish flake chair Carl Wars and my gym membership why are you still paying for those by the way I&#x27;ve never even seen you go to the gym well yeah but I&#x27;m going to start barking up Gertie loves herself a little beef cake okay you&#x27;ve got way too many subscriptions rocket money can help you with that oh my goodness did you just boom work your way into

plates more dates baby H it&#x27;s a little early for you to be thrown around gym phrases no hey uh you got a string hanging from your sleeve there I do oh sorry my mistake that&#x27;s your [Music] um whatever you say peee human that&#x27;s not funny [Laughter] [Music] for years certainly in my whole life we&#x27;ve heard how fossil fuel pollution is creating a runaway greenhouse effect at some point the ice caps will melt the oceans will rise and every Coastline in the world will be underwater what now when when does it happen when do we go underwater well that&#x27;s hard to 5 years 20 50 you can&#x27;t really quantify oh you you can&#x27;t quantify it huh look I don&#x27;t want it&#x27;s Florida still here what do you mean let me talk slowly so you can understand is Florida still there last I checked Florida is still there thank you I rest my case global warming is a myth it&#x27;s not a myth look this isn&#x27;t a video about climate change oh look global warming is not climate change my point is how dare you look do you want clean air clean air no who cares fine but do you want clean water well yeah right the point of this episode isn&#x27;t to argue one side of the climate debate or the other the point of this episode is that debating arguing and fighting about it isn&#x27;t necessary and hasn&#x27;t been for over a 100 years since the 1920s and perhaps even earlier scientists have discovered many different ways of making energy less expensive and more efficient however in every single case their technology was suppressed and in many cases the inventors died under strange circumstances okay you&#x27;ve got my attention now Charles POG was a Canadian mechanic and car tinkerer in the early 1930s he started experimenting with carburetors trying to improve fuel efficiency now if you&#x27;re not a Gearhead a carburetor is a part of a gas-powered engine that mixes air and fuel for comb bution the mixture is then sent to the engine cylinders where it&#x27;s ignited to power the engine now unlike traditional carburetors which mix air with liquid gasoline the PO carburetor fully vaporized gas before it entered the combustion chamber this made the engine more efficient much more efficient in 1936 POG was issued a patent for a high mileage carburetor this was his third iteration of the invention and his third patent in early 1936 the Breen Motor Company tested the PO carburetor on a Ford V8 Coupe it got 26.2 M on one pint of gasoline that&#x27;s almost 220 MP gallon Ford tested it they got 200 m per gallon the PO carburetor was tested for Canadian Automotive magazine they reported 218 m per gallon now that article created a lot of excitement but it wasn&#x27;t good news for Charles PO on the Toronto Stock Exchange Oil Company stock prices crashed Brokers were swamped with orders to dump all Oil stock immediately soon after that POG shop was broken into all carburators equipment notes and documents were stolen he never built another one he never spoke of the invention ever again someone got to him that&#x27;s the rumor but carburetors aren&#x27;t complicated if one man figures out how to make an engine more efficient others could do this too and they did but the oil companies did not forget about POG and the Damage he almost caused fuel efficient engines were not good for business so the oil companies Lobby the US government for help and a few years later in 1951 help [Music] arrived the concept of patents can be traced back to ancient times but the formal patent system that we know today came from Renaissance Europe the first known patent law was enacted in Venice in 1474 and it was a revolutionary idea designed to encourage Innovation it offered inventors a temporary Monopoly in exchange for sharing their inventions with Society but some inventions are legally patented and hidden from society in 1951 the United States passed The Invention secrecy act this allows the US government to keep certain Technologies and inventions secret legally if they decide something threatens the country&#x27;s economy or security it&#x27;s stamped with a secrecy order and classified the inventor can&#x27;t speak about it export it or sell it unless it&#x27;s to the US military yeah of course if the inventor violates these orders they face imprisonment or as we&#x27;re about to see consequences that are even worse in the 1970s Tom ogal accidentally discovered a way to make an engine run on its own fumes I was messing around with a lawn mower when I accidentally knocked a hole in its fuel tank I put a vacuum line running from the tank straight into the carburetor Inlet I just let it run and it kept running and running but the fuel level stayed the same I got excited the lawn mower was running without a carburetor and was getting tremendous efficiency that mower ran for 96 straight hours wa after a few months of trial and error Ogle replicated his invention with his own car his 1970 Ford Galaxy got 11 m per gallon but after a few modifications it got 100 m per gallon in April 1977 Ogle drove the 4,000lb car 205 M on Just 2 gall of gas Engineers inspected the car for hidden gas tanks and other gimmicks but nothing was found his technology worked Ogle made the internal combustion engine do what it was designed to do operate on fumes he accidentally invented a version of Po&#x27;s carburetor almost overnight 24-year-old Tom Ogle became an engineering sensation oil companies investors and businessmen approached him with offers people expected him to become a billionaire Shell Oil offered him $25 million cash for the design Ogle passed when he found out they intended to hide the invention forever I&#x27;ve always wanted to be rich and I suspect I will be when this system gets into distribution but I&#x27;m not going to have my system bought up and put on the Shelf so Tom struck deals with investors who would let him control the invention and keep working he filed for and received a patent he had attorneys money all kinds of resources then the United States Air Force showed interest uhoh and that&#x27;s when things went downhill downhill yep suddenly the SEC was after him for violating Securities laws the IRS was after him for failing to pay back taxes the next few months were a mess Ogle&#x27;s wife left him and took their daughter legal battles were everywhere investors were fighting for control of the patent then on April 14th 1978 Ogle was shot by a stranger outside a bar no suspect but he survived but not for long no not for long on August 18th he went to a friend&#x27;s apartment where he collapsed and died his death which involved painkillers and alcohol was ruled an accidental overdose though Tom Ogle had no history of drug use Ogle&#x27;s friends family and attorney claimed this was a cover up for murder Mur but the damage was done Tom Ole was gone and his invention despite the overwhelming evidence that it worked was conveniently forgotten later that year the US and Saudi Arabia negotiated the United States Saudi Arabian Joint Commission on economic cooperation they agreed to use US dollars for oil contracts the Petro dollar became the deao currency of the world that day this made the US government much more powerful and made oil companies richer than ever a few years later Lieutenant Colonel Charles Brown a former member of Project Blue Book made a similar invention he created a device that attached to the air intake of a vehicle reducing emissions by 50 to 70% and increasing miles per gallon I treat air and out of air I make it more than just providing oxygen for the combustion process they are combustion stimulating molecules and radicals generated in this process thunderstorm in a bottle even though the Colonel&#x27;s invention reduced emissions and cleaned the air the EPA shut him down Environmental Protection Agency is a bit of a dictatorial police agency they call themselves a protecting agency but they are a police agency EPA cannot approve a fuel saving device they put out RS of documentation stating that something will not work soon after he received bomb threats his lab was vandalized and everything was stolen he lost his life savings and his work was stopped like Charles POG and Tom Ogle Colonel Brown took his technology to his grave these inventions still used gasoline and oil that didn&#x27;t necessarily threaten the fossil fuel industry yet the government or someone still shut them down so you can only imagine what happens when you invent a car that doesn&#x27;t need gas at [Music] all the top our news here at 6:00 an age old dream becoming a reality a local inventor has discovered a way here this to use water to run your car is the answer to dependence on foreign oil lies all around us car that runs on water instead of gasoline man who invented an engine that can run on waterers any kind of H2O he says can power just about every type of come up with a device that will hook up to any engine and allow it to run on Good Old H2O Stanley Meer Stanley he&#x27;s been offered a billion dollar in cash by oil producing countries to sell his patent so far he hasn&#x27;t sold Stanley Meyer did not keep his invention secret he went straight to the news his announcement made headline lines across the country and around the world he had invented a car that can run on nothing but water the technology is called electrolysis this is using electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen gas now this isn&#x27;t a new invention in 1789 Jan Rudolph Diamond used an electrostatic machine to generate electricity from water that was then discharged to Gold electrodes and throughout the 19th century various inventors and scientists created machines that could split water into oxygen and hydrogen but there are a few problems the process requires a lot of energy and it requires perfectly pure water no minerals no chemicals nothing it has to be nothing but H2O it&#x27;s very hard to produce pure water not only do you need pure water for electrolysis you need lots of it Stanley Meers engine didn&#x27;t require much water at all Stan estimated that if he took his waterp powerered car from coast to coast in the US it use only 22 gallons of water and the biggest breakthrough it didn&#x27;t need pure water it could run on ordinary tap water he called his invention a water fuel cell injector the injector breaks water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen the engine runs and hydrogen gas he took his car on tour around the country Engineers inspected it and they said it worked we recently took a scientific delegation to witness Stan&#x27;s work to really evaluate it and came back saying this is one of the most important inventions of the century Stan tour got a lot of media coverage this led to offers from investors and oil companies and even the Pentagon Pentagon yeah let me guess that&#x27;s when things went downhill yep oh no in 1998 Stan was at a restaurant with his brother and a few Belgian investors they were about to sign a multi-million dollar deal so they raised their glasses and made a toast to celebrate then Stan suddenly became violently ill he ran out of the restaurant fell down in the street and started vomiting his brother ran after him Stan&#x27;s final words were they poisoned me but his death certificate doesn&#x27;t reflect that at all it says he was at lunch with officials from NATO and that he died of a brain aneurysm but if you read this statement you can kind of tell that the coroner was already questioning whether he was actually poisoned or not and and and just as Mist being poisoned as such a blatant lie and not true um I think a brain aneurysm is a very convenient way for somebody to die and if they were poisoned that can cause that it can cause that now lots of people have heard of Stanley Meers water car but what most people don&#x27;t know is that the waterp powerered engine wasn&#x27;t the only disruptive invention in Stan&#x27;s garage he also had a tourid shaped donut shaped he had a doughnut-shaped electromagnetic device slapped with a national security order even in my prior development of high technology I&#x27;ve had patents taken from me I learned from the School of Hard Knox to be very cautious CTI very he was paranoid and rightfully so and that&#x27;s why if you try to replicate the technology in Stan Meyer&#x27;s patent it won&#x27;t work he faked the voltage and frequency numbers to prevent another invention from being stolen or classified but Skeptics say it doesn&#x27;t matter what numbers you use the engine won&#x27;t work they say Stan technology broke the second law of Thermodynamics that states that every time you transfer energy energy is wasted Stan&#x27;s engine didn&#x27;t waste energy at all it created it but that also violates the first law of thermodynamics the conservation of energy that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but what if those laws are completely misunderstood that with the right technology the laws of thermodynamics don&#x27;t have to apply at all mainstream science doesn&#x27;t like that idea mainstream science can go pound Well turns out that Stan&#x27;s water car was his least important invention that donut shaped device was another invention that created energy and the reason it was classified well it didn&#x27;t run on gas it didn&#x27;t run on water it ran on nothing [Music] the vacuum of space is supposed to be empty and at the temperature of absolute zero it should be perfectly still but Quantum physicists discovered that empty space is not empty or still at all is that uh so-called empty space isn&#x27;t really empty at all it&#x27;s actually full of energy so instead of being like kind of a quiet empty Lake it&#x27;s more like the froth at the base of a waterfall or something now we&#x27;ve all been taught that in an atom electrons orbit the nucleus like planets orbit the Sun and in a vacuum with no resistance the orbits of electrons should be predictable but they&#x27;re not in 1955 Willis lamb won the Nobel Prize for discovering what&#x27;s become known as the lamb shift now in simple terms lamb discovered that electrons and hydrogen atoms were being disturbed by something he discovered complex interactions between the electron and the vacuum of space itself space is teeming with Quantum particles that blink in and out of existence and when they do that they use and create energy a lot of it well when you go to look at the numbers you find out that there&#x27;s enough energy in the volume of a coffee cup to evaporate all the world&#x27;s oceans that you could get it all of it enough energy to boil and evaporate all the oceans on Earth from a coffee cup of empty space this energy is called Zero Point Energy and it&#x27;s generated from the Zer point field Nicola Tesla Nikolai kerev and other scientists called this field The Ether The Ether is a field in which everything exists but it exists in a dimension that our brains can&#x27;t perceive particles blinking in and out of existence have to be coming from and going somewhere that place is The Ether the base layer of reality but even though we can&#x27;t see it this layer can be disrupted with electromagnetism Tesla famously said if you want to find the secrets of the universe think in terms of energy frequency and vibration he tried to harness energy from the zero point field using the tower he built on Long Island Tesla link blow the Tesla&#x27;s Warden Cliff Tower tapped into this endless supply of energy the tower was considered an overunity device an overunity is when something gives out more energy than is put in now mainstream science claims this is impossible again because it breaks the second law of Thermodynamics but for over a 100 years scientists and inventors have proved that claim wrong Zer Point Energy devices also violate the conservation of energy that energy can&#x27;t be created or destroyed but those inventors don&#x27;t claim to be creating energy from nothing they are tapping into the energy that are already exists everywhere all around us in the 1970s Howard Johnson created the magnetron motor it used hydrogen magnets light rays and fusion to create electricity now according to practical physics his invention was impossible but here&#x27;s the thing his motor worked and he proved it over and over again still he was denied a patent the Dilemma facing Johnson is not really his dilemma but rather that of other scientists who have observed his prototypes the devices obviously do work but the textbooks say they shouldn&#x27;t Johnson is saying to the scientific community that this is a phenomenon that seems to contradict some of our traditional beliefs for all our sakes let&#x27;s not dismiss it outright but take the time to understand the complex forces at work here Johnson didn&#x27;t get his patent and was shunned by the scientific Community now how Johnson wasn&#x27;t a weekend garage tinkerer he was a government contractor he worked on atomic energy projects He made equipment for the military he already had over 30 patents for chemistry and physics devices science and physicists are especially determined to protect the law of conservation of energy thus the physicists become game wardens who tell us what laws we can&#x27;t violate in this case they don&#x27;t even know what the game is but they are so scared Johnson&#x27;s motor would lose less than 2% efficiency in almost 20 years of continuous operation but he stopped working when someone broke into his shop and stole his equipment he got the message Thomas morray also invented a device that could tap into the zero point field his machine could generate 50,000 watts of power with no energy input another invention that broke the laws of physics morray tried to patent his invention he was denied they told him there&#x27;s no such thing as free energy but still the US government was interested yeah that&#x27;s when things go downhill yep yeah his lab was vandalized and robbed he and his family survived multiple assassination attempts it got so bad he bulletproofed his own car now despite the ongoing threats morray publicly demonstrated the success of his machine in 1940 continuously produced an output of 250,000 volts with no input well that was the last straw the next day someone broke into his lab and attacked him he only survived because at this point he was carrying a pistol everywhere but it didn&#x27;t matter Mor&#x27;s assistant turned on him and destroyed everything equipment that would be worth millions today officially Mor&#x27;s assistant went crazy but it sounds like somebody got to him Moray died broke and he took his technology to the Grave Edwin gray had a similar story gray created an electromagnetic motor that ran continuously on its own power and like all zero point devices it didn&#x27;t generate heat the input was 26.8 Watts the output over 7,000 Watts Gray&#x27;s machine was tested and verified by multiple scientists grace started developing this idea eight years ago for the past year and a half he&#x27;s been trying to get someone in the US government interested so far he&#x27;s had little luck after he contacted the government let me see uh things went down hill right yep yeah within a week local authorities performed an illegal raid on Gray&#x27;s lab They confiscated everything not long after that gray was found dead in his home all his records inventions and materials vanished Without a Trace now most of these inventions were from the turn of the 20th century over 100 years ago imagine the progress we could have made if this technology survived and the world had free energy this whole time but that&#x27;s the thing these stories happened so long ago that it&#x27;s difficult to picture them as anything more than stories I know you want to see video of one of these things operating you want to see light bulbs and Motors turning without wires and without plugs you want to see one of these zero point machines for yourself don&#x27;t you you got it Floyd site was nicknamed Sparky because he was fascinated with electricity he dreamed of a device that could take energy from the vacuum of space so after retiring in the 1980s he made one he called it a vacuum triode amplifier or VTA so we have 120 volt fan as you can see it&#x27;s turning at good power it is providing quite a breeze and it&#x27;s real usable power Sparky&#x27;s machine could do more than operate a fan he fed it 0.3 M and produced almost 224,000 Watts this was continuous OnDemand power if you attach more equipment it would simply harness more power No Limit and here just coming into view you see 5 100 watt lamps ordinary Garden variety household lamps brilliantly lit so there&#x27;s 500 watts of very real power here again coming right out of the vacuum 224,000 Watts from a box about the size of a deck of cards that&#x27;s enough to power your house recharge your electric car or light up a baseball field it doesn&#x27;t matter what you connect the zero point field will give you all the power you need this is real usable power it&#x27;s stable it is not transient it is not noise and it is not any other kind of spirous effect this is a real effect it&#x27;s all coming from that little tiny box sitting behind the 500 wats of power behind behind the lamps that little box is putting out all of that power well over 500 watts and yet it is receiving less than 1/3 of a millatt of input power so Sparky filed a patent yeah oh yep you know how this goes well at the grocery store A well-dressed man approached Sparky and showed him a photograph it was a picture of Sparky and his wife in their house taken from outside someone had been watching them he walked me all the way to my building telling me what would happen to me if I didn&#x27;t stop my research how they took that picture through my window I&#x27;ll never know Sparky reported the incident to the FBI oh that&#x27;s like the hen calling the wolf for help it was things got worse Sparky and his wife started getting harassed their phone rang hundreds of times a day from pay phones all over the country the call stopped when someone broke into Sparky&#x27;s lab and stole his notes then one night two men stopped by to speak to Sparky and his wife the men left and about an hour later Sparky collapsed frantic his wife called an ambulance but when they loaded Sparky they refused to let his wife in the ambulance 20 minutes later she got a call Sparky was dead heart attack less than 24 hours later a few black van F showed up at the house the FBI confiscated all Sparky&#x27;s equipment and research and that&#x27;s the last we&#x27;ve heard about it but Sparky&#x27;s VTA did more than create unlimited power it could levitate a retired army officer and nuclear physicist named Tom Bearden met with Sparky he was intrigued by the vta&#x27;s potential Bearden asked Sparky to do an anti-gravity experiment with it and it worked the VTA weighed about 6 lb they reduced the weight of it by 90% according to bearden&#x27;s Theory gravity can become a pushing force rather than a pulling force and that&#x27;s exactly what the VTA did Z Point Energy anti-gravity now if this sounds like UFO technology that&#x27;s because it is Richard doie Says Z Point Energy devices have been recovered from UFOs and they operate a lot like Sparky&#x27;s VTA what this was was an energy device that uh that used a Zero Point Energy that&#x27;s what they referred it to as Z Point Energy and and it was connected in such a manner that this device could power I mean from very small uh FL flashlight or very small watch up to a city and and the U uh Power was determined by what the demand on it was and so each craft had one of these anti-gravity technology is another reality that&#x27;s been suppressed for years and researching anti-gravity even for the US government is very very [Music] dangerous according to multiple inventors many of which are now dead alien technology might not be so alien after all Italian researcher Johnny dto created a large ring to go around the human body its purpose was to alter DNA to reverse aging now made of heavy copper the data ring manipulates the magnetic field around a human body using gravity and frequency it was inspired by The hza Valley in Pakistan where people rarely get sick and routinely live for over a 100 years now most researchers say their longevity is because of exercise and a healthy diet but do had a different theory he said the extreme heat from the valley and the cold from the nearby Glacier created a magnetic anomaly in the area this protects DNA and slows the aging process process the do ring was even tested at SLO ketering hospital it successfully lengthened the subject&#x27;s telome the part of our DNA that shortens as we age the ring worked and just like Sparky&#x27;s device Do&#x27;s device could levitate then the FDA became involved and everything went downhill yep they shut down Do&#x27;s research not long after that D was hit by a car that ran over him multiple times the levitating age reverse D ring vanished T towns and brown used a high voltage an electromagnetic field to create a lift effect this allowed an object to move at high speeds free of the force of gravity Brown made a flying saucer as with many other promising inventions developed during the Cold War years the national secrecy act prevented scientists like ttwn and Brown from commercializing or even publicizing any technology which could put potentially be interpreted as having a military application now anti-gravity or anti-grav technology was popular in the 1950s the United States and Canadian governments were both working on anti-g gravitic technology they farm this workout to well-known aerospace companies like locky Martin conve Bell and Lear the research was actually out in the open and created a buzz people were excited about the new G engines and how this technology would revolutionize traveling the talked about how everyone could have a flying car airplanes wouldn&#x27;t need any fuel to fly this is one of the last public mentions of anti-gravity technology Lawrence D Bell the famous builder of the rocket research plane says we&#x27;re already working with nuclear fuels and equipment to cancel out gravity and William Lear the autopilot wizard is already figuring out gravity control for the weightless craft to come according to the Gravity Research Engineers the G engine will replace all other [Music] Motors after that everything went dark so what happened what happened was the military contractors got anti-gravity to work and they wanted the technology all to [Music] themselves after working at the center for space plasma and aeronomic research Dr ning Lee started her own anti-gravity research company ACG gravity in the early 1990s she published research papers on anti-gravity this Drew attention from the US government and then everything went down downhill yep in 2001 ning Lee received a grant from the US Department of Defense for over $400,000 to continue anti-g gravitic research then ning Lee disappeared now some people think she returned to China to work for them but others say she was caught up with her work at the dod some family members recall that she seemed extremely stressed during that time she used to love her research but she did not like working for the dod but in 2014 13 years later ning Lee reappeared out of nowhere I didn&#x27;t see that coming and then she was hit by a car that I saw it coming she suffered permanent brain damage ning&#x27;s whereabouts during those Missing Years is still a mystery but my guess is the Department of Defense knows exactly where she was but they&#x27;ll never tell and nobody&#x27;s going to ask [Music] free clean unlimited energy anti-gravity science fiction technology that some people claim is real but is it well search Google in Wikipedia and they&#x27;ll list most of these inventors as charlatans liars and frauds of course that&#x27;s what they say they&#x27;re in the pocket of the Shadow government I can&#x27;t argue with that so let&#x27;s go through a few Stam Meyer the man who invented the water-powered car receives a lot of scrutiny probably because his story is so well known now despite his claim of being poisoned doctors said his cause of death was a brain aneurysm now some poisons can cause an aneurysm but his toxicology report showed no poison fake report well his family thought so Moray gray Sparky Ogle and Johnson they all had patented inventions that garnered the attention of powerful people and they were all victims of violence some of them were no-name backyard inventors who happen to be good at Electronics but many were engineers or physicists with impressive credentials and there&#x27;s a lot of evidence to support their stories honestly I cover just the most well-known inventors there are many many more and most of them also died under mysterious circumstances and in almost every case their technology was seized and classified now despite the evidence of these inventions working and the reality of quantm physics there&#x27;s a tremendous amount of push back about zero point or alternate energy why mainstream Academia elected officials and even the media say free energy is impossible any scientist who claims otherwise is attacked sometimes professionally but sometimes they&#x27;re attacked physically why money and power I was asking rhetorically but yes money and power when Dr Tom fom was working at the US patent office he came across inventions that could solve our energy and pollution problems inventions that could literally change the world and accelerate the progress of humanity he became frustrated when he saw invention after invention slapped with a secrecy order patent sequestering which is actually called secreti public needs to know at least that every major military agency has a representative at the patent office and when vone blew the whistle they fired him just fired I&#x27;m surprised this guy didn&#x27;t get whacked oh yeah he better be watching his back pattent office in its current approach is it&#x27;s actually breaking the law it&#x27;s trying to make happy the uh physicists who are with American physical Society to keep them in power with their ideas you might say and withhold from public use good inventions that could solve our problems like the energy crisis for over 100 years these technologies have been suppressed keeping Society in a state of complacency poverty and pollution the Federation of American scientists spoke about suppression in 2010 calculating that in that year alone 5,135 inventions were given a secrecy order most of these patents had to do with clean energy anti-gravity and alternative methods of propulsion over 5,000 in one year so how many in 10 years how many in a 100 what technology is being hidden from us The Latest Buzz phrase is green energy or the green movement that sounds nice we all want a clean environment but green energy as currently defined is a fad no that&#x27;s not the right word green energy is a scam why suppress thousands maybe tens of thousands of inventions that could clean our planet and provide free energy for everyone on Earth for money and power yep there are literally hundreds of trillions of dollars at stake so next time you&#x27;re arguing with a friend or family member about climate change remember the energy industry and the United States government want you to hate each other don&#x27;t play into their hands a Declassified document made in the 1970s lists categories of inventions that are considered secret one of those categories is for energy systems that are more than 70 to 80% efficient and solar panels that are more than 20% efficient if you patent an efficient energy or propulsion device it gets slapped with the secrecy order do you want proof in 1971 over 50 years ago someone patented a solar panel that was 20% efficient it was made secret you could have had solar panels on your house for years but you never knew they existed today solar panels are only slightly better than 20% efficient imagine how much they could have improved if the technology had not been hidden for 40 years so what about green energy it&#x27;s a scam green energy is not designed to do anything but line the pockets of politicians and the CEOs of the green energy companies that get billions of dollars of your money in the form of subsidies to research things like solar panels and wind farms and by the way solar panels only last about 15 to 20 years then they go into a landfill to Decay and that material is toxic solar panels also produce tons of toxic waste but even if we reduce this waste during manufacturing solar panels eventually stop working especially if they&#x27;re poorly made in China and when their lifespan is over they leave behind toxic trash then it seeps into our water supply scam wind farms barely produce any power but they destroy the landscape kill wildlife and again require an enormous amount of fossil fuels to build scam nuclear energy sounds great no pollution but when the nuclear material is discarded it stays radioactive and deadly for thousands of years scam do you think your electric car is protecting the environment it&#x27;s actually making it worse over 80% of electricity comes from coal oil and natural gas so yeah your Tesla runs on coal scam the amount of fossil fuels used to extract the raw materials to build electric cars causes a lot of pollution and the lithium batteries that power them lithium mines are awful for the environment not to mention most of the extraction of these materials is done with slave labor in terrible working conditions scam now don&#x27;t get defensive this isn&#x27;t your fault the technology to fix this is there and has been for 100 years so do all these patents just sit on a shelf Gathering dust never to see the light of day oh no a scientist named Salvatore P has multiple patents strikingly similar to allegedly impossible inventions he&#x27;s patented devices that use electromagnetic fields vibrations and Quantum field fluctuations to manipulate gravity mass and energy he has a patent that allows for faster than light speed travel he has a patent that can change the course of astroid roids through a magnetic field and by favorite Salvatore pus invention he has a patent for a tiny solid state device about the size of a deck of cards that can generate unlimited clean energy from the vacuum so how come his inventions aren&#x27;t suppressed well because the patents are owned by or have been assigned to the United States Navy now I&#x27;m sure that most clean energy anti-gravity inventors are frauds but not all of them I believe the technology does exist and I believe it&#x27;s being used right now by government contractors however these contractors don&#x27;t work for the US government they work for the shadow government a shadowy government with its own Air Force his own Navy his own fundraising mechanism and the ability to pursue his own ideas of the national interest free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself we have the technology to eliminate famine and heal the ecosystem but that would derail the shadow government&#x27;s agenda there is the government constitutional government of the United States and then there&#x27;s this other secret government operation which has more money more power more technology it is a criminal Enterprise it is not sanctioned by the president and it is not sanctioned by Congress and yet they&#x27;re using our tax dollars and are raping the planet and destroying the Earth and impoverishing half the planet we could live in a world of abundance no more Wars for energy but the shadow government becomes powerless in a world of abundance they derive their power from scarcity because they control the resources resources that could be made completely free if we only had access to suppressed technology so what&#x27;s the solution elect new leaders no our leaders are controlled by or in fear of the Shadow government they only care about being reelected and getting rich all of them and don&#x27;t go to the media they&#x27;re in the pocket of the Shadow government whether they know it or not so do we repeal the invention secrecy act well that will never happen nobody will risk their career voting for it they&#x27;ll say some inventions need to be hidden for National Security and whenever you hear that phrase National Security remember it&#x27;s not your security they&#x27;re protecting it&#x27;s theirs the solution is simple but it&#x27;s not one inventors want to hear if you create a free energy device that you can prove Works do not patent it publish your invention anonymously on the internet and make it freely available to everyone don&#x27;t be foolish and think you can use the patent system to become rich they will not allow it and most likely they&#x27;ll kill you instead share your technology first you can change the world I promise the money will be there so to all you weekend tinkerers and free energy hobbyists keep tinkering and keep inventing but most of all keep quiet thank you so much for hanging out today my name

thday night Wednesday J through the night all I ever wanted was you just see the truth to all through the night w [Music] the M man Sid and the solar Stone still come to a go the The Secret City Underground mysterious num stations Planet Sero to project Stargate and W the dark Watchers found we in a simulation don&#x27;t you worry though the black Knack at a light and to me so I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m dancing with the F fish on thday night J to the night all I ever wanted was to just hear the truth so the off fish on thday night when they J you and me all through the night all ever want to just give the TR so the timeat all through the good love to Dan good love to Dan good love to Dan to dance loves to dance loves to dance on the dance ball because she is a camel and camels
