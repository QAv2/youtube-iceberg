            <p>We don&#x27;t have exotic propulsion principles. Like everything is, you know, chemical combustion essentially. You had Elon Musk on and he says, you know, um it&#x27;s all Newton&#x27;s three laws. You can&#x27;t get anything better. And I remember you asked him, you&#x27;re like, well, maybe if you what if you could get something better.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s impossible. Um we have not unified the field in physics. So you have the weak force, the strong force, um and and electromagnetism. And all of those have been reconciled. Gravity is out here hanging out by itself on an island.</p>
<p>So you have the standard model quantum field theory and you have Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity and the two are not reconcilable. It is my belief that if you were to reconcile them you could create exotic propulsion which I think you know any even you know reasonable theoretical physicist who&#x27;s credentialed would say if you could reconcile them that&#x27;s that&#x27;s possible. I think that Thomas Towns and Brown did this experimentally, not theoretically.</p>
