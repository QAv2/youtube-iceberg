            <p>this video doesn&#x27;t amount to much um it&#x27;s mostly just a peg shall we say or a foot stamp to hold um the link in the description that is the post on quora that i&#x27;ve posted recently um it&#x27;s about a different way of looking at free energy how not to have free energy which is the way our conventional wisdom is set up to be namely how do you suppress a surge every electrical engineer is given an attitude that surges are wrong they&#x27;re bad they&#x27;re parasitic they destroy equipment so let&#x27;s get rid of them let&#x27;s prevent them and suppress them whenever we can and so there are all these techniques for doing so well if you do the opposite of the technique then you get free energy and you don&#x27;t have to be an engineer to know how to use free energy because the simplest way that does not require rocket science intelligence to do so is to simply pass reactive power through a simple resistance um acting as a heating element not an inductive resistor but a res a simple resistor i mean excuse me not an inductive heating element but a simple resistor heating element in which no inductivity is involved just simple resistance to boil water turn a steam turbine rotate an electrical generator and there you&#x27;ve got electrical power without having to use nuclear power to do so because that&#x27;s all nuclear power plants do they boil water that&#x27;s all they do yet they also produce plutonium which the warmongers love to have huge arsenals of nuclear warheads to make us look strong and invincible so you can not only run a steam look on a locomotive but you can also run a nucle replace a nuclear power plant no coal you know putting out pollution in the air acid rain you know just reactive power it&#x27;s the simplest idea in the world or if you don&#x27;t want to produce heat you can produce light because incandescent bulbs know the old kind nobody has them anymore supposedly those are resistive loads so you can have all the light and heat you want to without having to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to make use of that reactive power and reactive circuits are so simple but they&#x27;re predicated on a very important basis if you want to do it right you have to not have any voltage source in there unless you&#x27;re using the voltage source as a methodology to suppress the free energy now i know that sounds backwards but there are ways of doing so i just that&#x27;s what this post is all about how to suppress a search because one of my problems that&#x27;s always a problem a challenge is how to turn off a free energy circuit you know it&#x27;s all very well and good i&#x27;m very good at simulating free energy circuits but turning them off is a whole other problem and they tend to explode in your face so i came up with a method and i suspected it might be the way the iman brothers did their device of a hundred years ago um but you know who knows um i suspected they were using their radio inside their car um but what i found out from uh working the problem yesterday simulating it is you don&#x27;t even need a crystal radio set you know uh galena diode and a co uh a coil based tuner you don&#x27;t even need that all you need is a whip antenna one yard long piece of wire a weapon the antenna that you know used to exist on older model cars you know that&#x27;s about a little over a yard long it&#x27;s telescoping you know when you pull it out of your hood or you push it down or if you had a fancy car you had a little motor electric motor push it up and pull it back down retract it but it was just a metallic stick um in the shape of a kind of a wire or narrow tubing that was several feet long not too many just a few feet to catch some area airwaves you know radio waves am radio waves well that&#x27;s all you need to pick up about a micro volt of power and you can use that but see now if you use it as a continual source so i used a battery of one micro volt in my simulation to uh simulate an input from an aerial an antenna and it actually suppressed the development of surge of a surge of free energy because it was continuous voltage source and i had it in the right place to suppress the development of the surge which was happening right in that section of the circuit and then i when i disconnect it this it goes back to developing a surge it dissipates whatever energy is in the system so it damps out just like a normal thermodynamic entropy entropy oriented circuit and then this other surge develops on the heels of the one of the dissipation of the pre-energy that was stored in the circuit so a surge is a different animal it&#x27;s not just energy it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a complex form of energy in that you&#x27;ve got a waveform that&#x27;s complex slightly complicated which has certain behavioral characteristics certain frequencies and if you come in with a voltage source that like a dc voltage source like a battery or a or or anything that&#x27;s a continuous voltage source from coming from outside the circuit what we take to be normal in running a circuit actually suppresses a surge and this is why we have this mentality oh i&#x27;ve got to supply my load with the full amount of voltage that it requires where else is it going to get it from you know it&#x27;s not going to get it from the air oh but it can get a little bit provided it&#x27;s an initiation an initial pre-charge condition on the capacitor so that what you give the capacitor one micro volt of a of a charge once it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s gone so it has a chance to dissipate step aside it&#x27;s never very strong to begin with but it quickly but it&#x27;s still if it was maintained it can be strong if it&#x27;s in the wrong place as i&#x27;m saying already but if it quickly dissipates it steps aside and so it won&#x27;t get in the way of the development of a surge and i put it in the very place where i try to suppress it so i have a pre-charged condition on two capacitors but i also have two batteries that are switched into or out of the circuit at that location and the batteries have also one micro volt on them just like the pre-charged capacitor had but unlike the battery the capacitor can oscillate with inductors nearby and create a surge because of the way the circuit is designed and that surge escalates to infinite oblivion if it&#x27;s not cut off at an appropriate point in time and then pulsed so that you get an average of power over time overall if you average out the pulses and you safeguard the circuit from destroying itself now electrical engineers will admit to what they call a resonant rise condition which destroys equipment so they already know free energy exists but they won&#x27;t give it the credit that it is due because we are not allowed to have it it&#x27;s not in corporate best interests namely the banking establishment and the military the banks would go out of business and they are very monopolistic very much so and the military would not be able to defend us from foreign invaders or domestic terrorists if they lost their grip their edge their yeah their edge if they lost their edge they want free energy all to themselves and the banks have their own version of free energy which is print their own money you know most currency is digital anyway so you don&#x27;t have to print it they just issue it into circulation digitally electronically 98 of that is non-paper non-coinage money uh of our economy 98 of our economy so it&#x27;s not hard for them to manufacture money but that&#x27;s their version of free energy so they don&#x27;t want you and i or some other garage mechanic or technician to come up with their own currency and issue it into circulation in the form of free energy because it would blow the economy the rates of everything would go sky high the people remaining who who are paying for energy and whatnot because of all of the other people generating their own energy and so much of today&#x27;s world is based on energy is nothing like it was back in the 1840s or 1850s when we had the initial days of the telegraph that was the only use of electricity at the time anything else might have been a toy a novelty you know but not a a a technological dependency a sociological dependency that was it um now there&#x27;s so much electrical energy my god it&#x27;s like yeah if the lights went out we&#x27;d starve and we&#x27;d freeze to death there would be starvation in the streets people would be running around wild you know it&#x27;s like oh my god you know anyway so i&#x27;m not exactly a piece i mean i like peace too but sometimes you got to wake up and it can you know from slumber it can be a little disturbing to be awakened when you don&#x27;t want to be i&#x27;ve had the opportunity to grow with this knowledge over the past four plus years so any ahas that freaked me out i got over it but i&#x27;ve seen this happen on a number of occasions where in a an administrator or a moderator of a forum or a message board system or a space they&#x27;ll shut down my messages or lock me out lock it down my account erase what i&#x27;ve posted so many times that it&#x27;s you know kind of ridiculous i do get to post on quora and i can post on energetic form but i&#x27;m basically ignored because nobody there wants to talk or hear about simulations they want to build something you know okay they&#x27;re a little more advanced than me in their desires i&#x27;m a little more cautious so well i want to understand it first i don&#x27;t want to just build it because i&#x27;ve heard stories of people who who have shrapnel all over their lab their arm almost gets taken off uh they quickly duck for cover and or exit the lab space before they get injured because their circuit simulation or their motors excuse me their circuit or their motor or their generator blew up and it obliterated itself one guy i read this over a decade ago he had a circuit he timed it on his watch all it was good for was frying itself and smoke would come up and the insulation on the coils would melt and short out and that would be the end of his circuit and it was something like 90 seconds i don&#x27;t know 45 seconds it was slightly over a minute or a couple minutes it wasn&#x27;t very long but the thing all it did was destroy itself that&#x27;s all it was good for and then he had to go build a new one and obviously nobody would want to do that you want to reuse your circuit now let me give you an example we create surges all the time by igniting gasoline inside of our internal combustion engines the problem though is that it&#x27;s said it&#x27;s a setup the very medium the gasoline that explodes upon ignition is consumed in the process in a non-reversible process unlike an electrical surge which is reversible in the sense that you can turn it into something useful and not and reuse some of that energy to build on it more energy and that&#x27;s why it accumulates at an exponential rate because it&#x27;s building on top of itself so it&#x27;s not a question of more energy and exiting the circuit then what enters it because we&#x27;re overlooking something far more insignificant that more energy is accumulating than what exits the circuit and that&#x27;s why it destroys itself it&#x27;s so we&#x27;re ignoring this middle step of accumulation as if it does not exist and so then we posit the problem to the collective mentality that oh you that doesn&#x27;t work that&#x27;s not even logical to have more energy exiting the circuit than what enters it that would be like more water flowing out of a tea kettle than what you put in it i mean that doesn&#x27;t make sense does it but we skip the metal step and we ignore it the middle step is the accumulation of energy which is not energy it&#x27;s reactants so we convert energy into reactants we accumulate it because it cannot dissipate because it cannot see an inductive low excuse me a reactive load all i can see is a simple resistance and then we manipulate it by by expanding it we could contract it if we want to make it seemingly shrink into an oblivious list obliviousness of nothingness although it&#x27;s there we just can&#x27;t see it it&#x27;s so tiny and then we convert it back into energy if we&#x27;re an electrical engineer know how to do so but i since i&#x27;m not an electrical engineer i just know the simple ways to pass it through a resistor and now we got heat or light or both so it&#x27;s this middle step we&#x27;re all forgetting about but be that as it may the post on quora i took a different approach and i thought okay because i&#x27;m trying to figure out how to regulate the thing by turning it off now i had another version of this circuit that was easy to turn off i just short out two specific points in the circuit well it was two sets two pi it was a pair of points with a simple resistor and it shorted out and it it killed the search killed any pre-existing search and it prevented any future search from arising but now in this new version um and it&#x27;s done in lt spice because that one was done in microcap i could that doesn&#x27;t work so i i was kind of wondering well how do you turn this thing off you know it&#x27;s great to have free energy but you don&#x27;t want you want to be able to turn it off you know you don&#x27;t want it continually running about to blow itself up in a fraction of a second and that&#x27;s the other problem it does i got its efficiency up to the point that it&#x27;s no longer taking like 20 000 seconds to reach an appreciable amount of energy or reactants if you prefer to call it to be more accurate um now it&#x27;s um milliseconds i had it down to nanoseconds but now i i&#x27;ve lowered its efficiency so now it&#x27;s up to milliseconds but still that&#x27;s how how can anybody you know well in any case i do have i figured out how to turn it off um and it&#x27;s simply to input anything any kind of continuous voltage from an exterior source that&#x27;s either very low frequency or else dc which is kind of equivalent you know dc is kind of equivalent to an extremely low frequency and we&#x27;re talking frequency that&#x27;s on the order of one e to the negative seven you know that&#x27;s like a hundred nano cycles per second which means you basically would have to spend 000 seconds to see one oscillation one cycle of an oscillation you&#x27;d have to wait 10 000 seconds no excuse me 10 million yeah 100 nano is 10 million you&#x27;d have to wait sorry 10 million seconds to see one full wave occur a rise in a fall of one oscillation one cycle of an oscillation that&#x27;s a pretty slow wave a pretty long wavelength and it&#x27;s so long and stretched out it&#x27;s practically dc in its behavioral characteristic and so i found that i could use either one to suppress a search now if i used a fast oscillation go the opposite way at 1 e to the positive 7 which is 10 million cycles per second i was actually boosting i think i i think i yeah i was boosting the um the surge anyway i had to find a way that worked so i found i just used a low frequency or hey forget the frequency and just use dc but it has to be one micro volt you know because anything more would be you&#x27;d be wasting your power you know why use anything more when you don&#x27;t need to so a micro vault and that&#x27;s what mother nature provides in our environment the trees give and receive that much power their design they&#x27;re in the shape of an ariel the old style aerial the tv antennas we used to have 50 years ago on the rooftops of our homes [Music] and the same amount of power that a crystal radio set will get from an am radio broadcast so that&#x27;s all the energy you need to run anything a battleship a solar system whatever amount of energy you want i mean anyway so you know i laugh at how ridiculous conventional wisdom is but you know i forget the road i took to get to this point so i really am not exercising much compassion in your direction but um i can&#x27;t help it i&#x27;m i&#x27;m i am now the way i am now i&#x27;ve cultivated this sensibility that was never there before i had the same sensibility everybody else had except in my heart i i had a different thought but it was not a trained thought it was just a belief or a wish full of thought you know a fantasy a desire now i have experience even though it&#x27;s virtual reality it&#x27;s still experienced and is predicated on the robotic machines the simulator software i&#x27;m sorry i&#x27;m old and cranky i&#x27;m not healthy and young anymore um simulators are used by engineers to get a kind of a rough estimate of what to expect when they go to work on the circuit on the bench when they build it and so you can&#x27;t take it as a verbatim such you know guidance you have to understand that there&#x27;s a lot of room for interpretation but if you&#x27;re familiar with the world of the simulator and the world of the real world you can translate from one to the other and from the other back into the one and that ability to translate is important just to give you an example i used to think paul falstad simulator was a bunch of crap because it was so easy and it still is to create over unity i hate to use the word the c word but that&#x27;s what i was not at first i thought it was fantastic because it made it so easy to learn then i realized it&#x27;s too easy well it turns out there&#x27;s nothing wrong with its reality if you know how to translate it and the the translation is this you get the free energy if you use his transformer in your circuit it&#x27;s so easy without the transformer i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible it might be but i don&#x27;t think so from what i can recall now there&#x27;s something about his transformer that&#x27;s very uh peculiar it&#x27;s different than our our current day transformers it&#x27;s as if a the core material is not the same and b there&#x27;s tons of it now how you squish a ton or several thousand tons of iron into the core of an inductor is anybody&#x27;s guess obviously you magnetically couple it to a larger mass outside the core be that as it may it&#x27;s also a different material today&#x27;s material is designed to suppress eddy currents and so they take powdered iron they compress it in an epoxy base to insulate all the particles from each other so that there&#x27;s no eddy current production well that&#x27;s not what i want in an over unity circuit i want eddy currents in the core material and i want tons of core material there in the core of the inductor somehow magnetically coupled to it so that we can somehow get away with having tons of core material so it has to be solid steel you know magnetizable iron yeah but a solid iron magnetizable iron not this other kind that&#x27;s friable you know you get the transformer from amazon and you just hit it with a hammer the core and the thing turns to dust what i thought it was made of steel no because it&#x27;s supposed to suppress eddy currents well that&#x27;s not going to help if you&#x27;re trying to create free energy it&#x27;s probably going to get in your way and create problems and then you&#x27;re going to wonder why oh gee it&#x27;s not a surprise free energy is a sham no it&#x27;s not we&#x27;ve engineered our world over the course of the last century to be oblivious to free energy and to be favorable to buying new batteries when your battery gets spent or recharging batteries because it gets spent and circuits that have to require the full amount of voltage to suppress surges and to we pay the cost us to pay through the nose for all of our energy costs and then you gotta work and fight and for the uh diminishing dollars you know because of inflation the diminishing availability of dollars in circulation and so it&#x27;s like okay what kind of rat race and the shrinking middle class you know my mom didn&#x27;t have to work when i was born i don&#x27;t know about moms today they all have to seem to have to work so it&#x27;s a different world today and different economic factors but also we&#x27;re not savvy like we were a century ago we do things differently i&#x27;ve just given you a few examples just a few i think the iman brothers did what nathan stubblefield managed to do i think that&#x27;s where they got their inspiration from they may have got gotten it from tesla as well because they&#x27;re all living in the same era but at least we have evidence as to what nathan stonefield did and we have a little bit of what the amman brothers did and they&#x27;re very similar in how they do things so i think that&#x27;s the where to look for um some kind of role model you know or uh credibility or you know a causation where did the mon brothers get their ideas from to come up with whatever it was they did or however it was they managed to do it because it is a mystery still to this day we don&#x27;t know how they did it we just know little bits and pieces of their story but not the whole story so my i made it my task to try to understand it and i started some time ago but actually with tesla&#x27;s special generator because that&#x27;s a similar device that uses lots of iron um magnetically coupled to the core of its transformer um but it&#x27;s not the same device and so okay well how did the imam brothers do it what was their approach and i&#x27;ve discovered that parallel capacitance adjacent to or inside of coils that are undergoing mutual inductivity that&#x27;s the magic but they all have to have parallel capacitance not just some of them every single one of them that has mutual inductivity you know that one in other words two or more coils that are sharing their magnetic flux and transferring power magnetically between each other all of them have to exhibit parallel capacitance of the right amount and the right equivalent series resistance either inside themselves or adjacent to them in parallel to themselves or in parallel within themselves and you get an unbelievable phenomenon in which it doesn&#x27;t matter anymore what their their coupling coefficient is between those coils it could be anything ridiculously low meaning the coils could be separated by a distance and the iman brother sierra le mans claimed you needed to be within 10 miles of his power supply but you didn&#x27;t have to be electrically connected to it all you had to do was receive it you know you had to have a coil adjacent to some iron solid iron and the coil came alive and you could connect it to a circuit and you&#x27;d have power for your circuit and it was like whoa 10 miles whoa so this is the kind of way they did things very different than today&#x27;s world you can&#x27;t do that in a simulator necessarily until i learned how nobody will tell you this i had to stumble across it if you artificially put parallel capacitance in your coils that you&#x27;re magnetically coupling to each other and you give a sufficient amount and it might have to be ridiculous you know and when you first start out things are ridiculous scales waiting a long time ridiculously high capacitances you know all kinds of things that are ridiculous but if you get results you can always tweak it to make it more efficient and learn over time how to make it more realistic so don&#x27;t worry about it being unrealistic at first if you get results just run with it keep going at it and you&#x27;ll get somewhere it just takes time anyway you</p>
