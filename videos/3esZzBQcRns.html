            <p>hello I&#x27;m Dr Ronald W SATs founder and chair of the international Society of unified science this is my paper theory of unit space time and displacements from unit space time material and Cosmic photons sub atoms and atoms abstract the reciprocal system is in competition with quantum mechanics the standard model of particle physics and general relativity whereas the reciprocal system accepts Plank&#x27;s Quantum of radiation Einstein&#x27;s application to the photoelectric effect and Roy&#x27;s wave function for subatomic defraction it parts company with quantum mechanics in regards to the probabilistic wave function s for atoms reciprocal system rejects the concepts of the standard model of particle physics including its 36 quarks and eight GL blons and other quote gauge bons reciprocal system also rejects the non- idian geometry of general relativity and similar gravitational theories this paper provides the concepts in mathematics of the reciprocal System Theory of SpaceTime photons sub atoms and atoms both material and cosmic space and time are the two reciprocal aspects of space time and are perfectly SYM metrical bare space time represents unit speed C photons sub atoms and atoms are displacements up or down from unit speed there are thus two major sectors of the universe the material half with speeds usually below that of c and the cosmic half with speeds usually above that of C but in the cosmic sector the motion is in time rather than in space so the velocity equation is inverted the cosmic particles are inverse to the material particles not anti to the material particles there is no missing antimatter sector of the universe the cosmic sectors localized in time not space and therefore mostly invisible to us except for the cosmic background radiation and the cosmic rays the actions of entities depend on their space-time concentrations and their space-time separations there are no gauge bosons exchanged between particles introduction and literature review Dy B Larson an engineer scientist originated the reciprocal system of theory his many books are listed in references 1 through 8 the present author summarized the reciprocal system in reference 9 and has worked at many of the technical details in numerous papers see references 10 to 30 this current paper updates some of the earlier work mostly published in the isus journal reciprocity listed in references 19 to 30 the reciprocal system is in competition with many of the theories of so-called quote modern physics numerous books exist touting quote modern physics reference 31 is useful for its examples and solved problems and early work though silon values reference 32 Professor penrose&#x27;s work reference 33 is 1,99 pages long the first 400 pages of which are the mathematics and the remaining 699 Pages the physics are practically every contemporary Theory except for the reciproc syst Professor bei&#x27;s work reference 34 provides an up-to-date treatment of quote elementary particle physics to his credit he does recognize on page five that mass is Loren and variant unlike what is stated in practically every other conventional physics book a couple of earlier works on partical physics references 35 and 36 are still useful for their Clarity part artical physics and astrophysics are intimately related reference 37 tackles high energy astrophysics including cosmic rays reference 38 is a simple treatment of astronomy with some solved problems Professor Lang is known for his numerous books on astronomy and astrophysics reference 39 is his latest at an intermediate level whereas reference 40 is his Advanced mathematical treatment to his credit Professor Lang describes the quote faint young Paradox or faint young Sun Paradox reference 39 Pages 252 253 which shows that the sun has actually moved up the main sequence in accord with the reciprocal system whereas it should have remained essentially in the same location as when it Formed according to Conventional Theory Professor Lang also points out that quantum mechanical tunneling pages 220 224 is necessary to explain how the hydrogen ions overcome the kulic barrier to fuse in order to generate allegedly the sun&#x27;s energy this is of course a clu reference 41 by Professor shu is still a standard astrophysics work used in college although it&#x27;s been superseded to some extent by reference 42 a couple verly Works in astrophysic are still useful reference 43 and reference 44 Professor Harwood author reference 43 now has a fourth edition of his work available but he asked the same uh he asked essentially the same questions at the end of it in the epilogue so it seems that nothing much has been achieved in conventional Theory over the past few decades handbooks and encyclopedias are indispens princi to any working theoretical physicist reference 45 has many tables of astrophysical data arranged very nicely reference 46 is an encyclopedia for astronomy and astrophysics reference 47 is a recent physics handbook from Germany very concise and very comprehensive and nicely types said reference 48 is an old handbook but it has a detailed treatment of cosmic rays reference 49 a Russian compilation has been extremely useful to the as an author all throughout the work on his current set of theoretical physics papers it has a very detailed table of all Quote Elementary particles reference 50 the CRC Handbook is the standard for American physical scientists reference 51 is an online reference to the latest results from the particle accelerators and reference 52 has a well organized color insert displaying the basics of the standard model of particle physics I&#x27;m going to Glide over the nenat here because I&#x27;ll explain the symbols as we go along page down the section is the unit conversions and physical con constants here we have to convert from natural units to uh the conventional units that are used so we have the speed of light C the the uh natural unit of distance in the ccal system is 4.55 a816 * 10- 6 cm interv Regional ratio is 156.43 Kelvin and so on for the rest of the constants uh when masses are stated in terms of me this should be interpreted as me / c^2 multiply 3 by c^2 this is kind of customary to leave off the c section one space time a the natural reference system the gravitationally bound reference systems for motion most physical theories view time is onedimensional and constituting a kind of Quasi space which joins with the three dimensions of space to form A four-dimensional Spacetime framework within which physical objects move one-dimensionally this VI has been formulated to help explain some of the new phenomena discovered in the 20th century such as the very small the very large and the very fast these phenomena exist outside of our normal everyday world where Newton&#x27;s Laws predominate and where space seems to be totally separate from time however even with this modern framework most of these phenomena remain mysteries in whole or in part in contrast the reciprocal system of theory postulates that both space and time have threedimensional aspects and join together to form one entity space time or motion which itself is three-dimensional space and time are the two reciprocal aspects of motion and have no properties other than what they have in motion here SpaceTime or motion is theorized to be the sole component of the physical Universe not the framework or the background for particles of matter or quote forces matter in the theory is itself a form of rotational motion and may move translationally in more than one dimension coincidentally the notarian reference system is based on three dimensions of space and one of time the space is considered to be stationary and the time is considered to be flowing within this space material objects move as a function of time in one dimension in a specific vector torial Direction the classical physics textbooks hardly ever treat purely scalar motion this one dimension of motion may be resolved into three components one along each of the three orthogonal axes of the reference system usually denoted XY Z or X1 X2 X3 in cartisian coordinates in the reciprocal system space and time each have the properties of the other time is three-dimensional like space and space progresses like time of course the gravitationally bound of course in the gravitationally bound material environment space appears to be stationary and three-dimensional and time appears to be onedimensional and progressing and so the Newtonian reference system works for the situation in a gravitationally bound Cosmic or inverse environment where space and time were interchanged time would appear to be stationary and three-dimensional and space would appear to be onedimensional and progressing so in the reciprocal system two types of gravitationally bound reference systems exist the First with three dimensions of space and one of time and the second with three dimensions of time and one of space the first is applicable to objects which are aggregated in space space as in our ordinary material sector and the second is applicable to objects which are aggregated in time as in the cosmic sector conventional physical science says that there are quote anti- particles and quote anti- galaxies but does not stipulate an anti- reference system of course in the reciprocal system quote anti- particles do not exist just particles and inverse PLS also this opposed dark matter is simply ordinary or Cosmic matter unilluminated mostly between galaxies a common mistake of students of the reciprocal system is to deduce from the above statements that there are the six dimensions of the universe three of space and three of time some students even conclude there are nine dimensions in the universe three of space three of time and three of SpaceTime this is not correct however all that actually exists are three dimensions of motion not three dimensions of space or time Dimensions separately of course we&#x27;re convenient we can mentally fix one component while allowing the other to move this has the effect of concentrating on one aspect of each of the components while ignoring the others but it&#x27;s important not to forget that space and time do not exist separately they&#x27;re bound together in units of motion which are which is the actual physical reality outside of our gravitationally bound region what happens it is observed in astronomy that distant galaxies are moving away from our galaxy and all others at speech approaching that of light the current explanation is that this is a result of a hypothetical Big Bang some 13.7 billion years ago but even that expl a is not enough the galaxies are accelerating away from each other instead of slowing down so now the conventional theorists are postulating some sort of dark energy to account for this in addition to the Big Bang of course this is not the explanation of the reciprocal system here the cause is the SpaceTime progression which manifests itself in gravitation is attenuated it is an effect brought about by the motion of the natural reference system relative to our conventional stationary spatial reference system the fundamental equation of motion in the reciprocal system is not some fancy partial differential equation rather it is the simplest possible equation relating space and time to speed or velocity for the normal low speed Motion in the material sector the equation is of course V subm and the M is for material equals S Sub coordinate / T sub clock meters per second just for the conventional SI measurement this assumes that S Sub coordinate is much the magnitude is much less than the qu magnitude with a normal low inverse speed Motion in the cosmic sector we have the inverse V sub Cals T sub coordinate / S Sub clock seconds per meter or the absolute magnitude of the T sub coordinate is much much less than S Sub clock equations 1 a and 1B over gravitationally bound material and Cosmic systems respectively the natural reference system is not gravitationally bound because it exists prior to matter so the speed of velocity equation is v subpal s sub clock / T sub clock and V subp equals T sub clock divided by S Sub clock this immediately implies that in natural units V subpals 1 and V sub P equals c in conventional units like me/ second the natural reference system moves at unit speed which we can identify as the speed of light c c reference 11 for the dimensions of physical quantities in reciprocal system the one-dimensional clock space of all space time units generates the three-dimensional coordinate space and the onedimensional clock time of all space units generates the three-dimensional coordinate time now consider a collection of SpaceTime units moving outward from any point in our gravitationally bound system the equation in cartisian coordinates is x sub 1^ 2 + x sub 2^ 2 + x 3^2 = c^2 * T ^2 please note that because the motion is actually scalar outward only the imputation of a specific vectorial direction for a particular space time unit is arbitrary similarly there is an outward motion of the natural reference system relative to a gravitationally bound Cosmic system the equation is by inspection T sub 1^ 2 + T sub 2 + T sub 3^2 = x^2 c^2 seconds in conventional units again the assigned Cosmic vectorial directions are arbitrary since this is actually a scalar motion outward in all directions note that the space-time progression originates everywhere and is omnipresent there&#x27;s no quote single point of an explosion there was no big bang and there&#x27;s no Dark Energy also note that both equations 3A and 3B are Loren in variant the speed of light is the same relative to any other reference system reference 31 page 30 the two major sectors of the universe the material sector and the cosmic sector each with their appropriate reference system are stable in between these two sectors is an unstable transition zone which cannot be represented properly by either reference system this is where multi-dimensional motions occur B lent Transformations note that equation when a ignores coordinate time and equation 1B ignores coordinate space but at a substantial fraction of the speed of light or inverse speed flight coordinate time and coordinate space cannot be ignored this this h Loren empirically derived his transformations in 1892 these were then adopted into Einstein&#x27;s special Theory relativity in 1905 of course they work as well in the reciprocal system although we do not accept the concept of space contraction for the material sector or time contraction for the cosmic sector the entire correction to the usual velocity equations is due to coordinate time in our sector and coordinate space in the cosmic sector C reference one second edition Pages 100 to 104 for the material sector b subm equals t to the 2 power minus t clock to the second power all raised to 12 power time C subm / T where T here is the total time T is greater than T CL course and T coordinate time is equal to T minus t CL that&#x27;s the time delation and that&#x27;s for the material sector the cosmic sector C subc is equal to the inverse of C subn so therefore V Sub C equals the &lt; TK of s s- s is clock s time C sub c s where s is the total space s being greater than S clock s coordinate equal s minus s clock and that&#x27;s space dilation for the cosmic sector the maximum onedimensional speed of material object in material sector is vmm maxal C subn me/ second and the maximum one dimensional speed of a cosmic object in the cosmic sector is V sub c maxal c subc seconds per meter however unlike other theories the reciprocal system allows motion coincidentally in two or three dimensions the dimensions are of course orthogonal so multi-dimensional motion is not vectorial it is scalar only the Motions in the different dimensions are added together as scalers for some purposes and treated separately for others in the reciprocal system mass does not increase with translational motion it is Loren and variant Mass depends only only on the kinding quantity of the rotational spin of the atoms see below therefore the Loren factor which is the &lt; TK of 1us e subm / C subm squ should not be grouped with a mass it should be grouped with the force although the endn numerical result doesn&#x27;t change for example where there is a high relative speed of the masses involved the gravitational equation is f subg Time theun 1 - BM cm^ 2 = M1 * M2 / 1 G * s s Newtons poal UNS the Loren Factor modifies the force rather than dividing the mass the high velocity kinetic energy equation should be written as k = mc^ 2 * 1 over the &lt; TK of 1 - v subm c sub m^ 2 -1 which is m v if m is expressive m / c^2 thus There&#x27;s no distinction between mass and rest mass in the reciprocal system similar equations exist for the cosmic sector see multi-dimensional motion motion exists only in discrete units so the question Rises how can we have fractional units reciprocal system starts with one unit motion not zero units of motion this one unit of motion is equal to one unit of energy because of the reciprocal relation between space and time to achieve effective transational speeds below Unity we simply subtract the appropriate number of energy units from one equation of natural units is V sub m 1 - 1 /x sub energy where x sub energy is the number of onedimensional energy units with Dimension C over s inverse of velocity as X of energy is increased the speed is increased and in the limit reaches one or C in the time region the region inside unit space the numerical value of the energy term must be squared for reasons given reference one first edition page 19 so equation is actually V sub m = 1 - 1 x sub energy s in natural units suppose X of energy has the value n in the time region usually for the motion of an atom the energy is divided between the time region in the time space region region outside unit space with opposite vectorial directions let M be the time space reging quantity then subm = 1/ n^2 - 1/ m^2 in National units this is of course the basic spectroscopy equation in terms of speed rather than frequency it does not represent the orbitals of any alleged electrons circling an alleged nucleus clearly space time is not continuing it is discreet see reference 14 for a thorough treatment of spectroscopy in the reciprocal system because of the ability of adding or subtracting energy units to the three basic speed ranges three dimensions of motion we can have speeds of 1 - 1/x sub energy 2 - 1 /x of energy 3 - 1 /x of energy Lon denotes the speed range 1 minus 1/ X ener low speed the speed range 2 - one overx energy is intermediate speed and the speed range 3us ex energy ultra high speed because of the one-dimensional nature of energy it is not possible to go from one speed range to the next by simply adding more energy the only way to accomplish this is by direct addition of units of speed and the only way that can be accomplished is by huge Stellar or Galactic explosions radiation from matter moving at intermediate and ultra high speeds W be discussed in the radiation section of this paper by inspection one can see that the corresponding motions in the cosmic sector can be expressed as follow follows V sub Cal 1 - 1X sub b b sub c = 1 - 1X sub spe 2 B sub c = 1 - n c^ 2 - 1 over M sub c^2 at all in natural un speed ranges 1 - 1/ x sub Speed 2 - 1 x sub speed and 3 - 1 x sub speed if the motion of matter in R sector in dimension one exceeds C the velocity equation inverts and so the motion is in time rather than space because of the onedimensional speed limit of C although the object as a whole remains in the same time space macroscopic location a motion outward in time is equivalent to to em motion inward in space and so the object contracts its atoms move closer together in space in our ordinary spatial reference system we can identify such astronomical objects as white dwarfs poar quazar and Galactic cores as objects with Motion in the second dimension and therefore in time if the motion extends to the third dimension then the entire object moves translationally in space this is the situation with poar and quazo poar are white dwarfs with translational motion away from the Supernova explosion site in the third dimension of motion please note that there is no quote collapse of the atomic structure here the size of the atom in the reciprocal system is the same as that of the quote nucleus in conventional Theory poar are not neutron stars they have essentially the same atoms as any white dwarf same thing for the quers and galactic there&#x27;s no degenerate matter and there are no singularities or black holes likewise for the cosmic sector if the motion of C matter and Dimension One exceeds C subc the velocity equation inverts and so the motion is in space rather than in time because of the one-dimensional speed limit of C subc although the object as a whole remains in the same space time Cosmic macroscopic location a motion outward in space is equivalent to a motion inward in time so the object contracts in quotes and C atoms move closer together in time in the ordinary C temporal reference system we can identify such astronomical objects as SE white dwars C Pulsar C quers and C Galactic cores as objects with Motion in the second dimension therefore in space if motion extends to the third dimension then the entire object moves translationally in time this is the situation with Cesars and cazos C poar are sea white dwarves with translational motion time away from the C Supernova explosion site there is no Cosmic degenerate matter and there are no Cosmic singularities or cosmic black holes that concludes
