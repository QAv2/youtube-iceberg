            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>one of the most intriguing sentences in the New York Times report mentioned an exotic material of unknown origin that was at Bigelow Aerospace for a while is that from a crash do you think crashes have happened detailed proof the crashes have happened would be still highly classified piece of data well that&#x27;s an answer of sorts yeah there there have been there there has been one leaked document how it got leaked oh I&#x27;ll never know which is out there that talks about some crashes that we were able to verify what was was a real document so my opinion is that there probably is the Ark probably at least materials now would necessarily have to be crash of an entire craft but it could be you know a piece blown off and whatever by a lightning strike or a missile or whatever so so I&#x27;m not surprised to find out that there&#x27;s discussion of material being available we&#x27;ve had an opportunity to look at some unusual material and so I think that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a big area that will become more significant as time goes on I like you&#x27;re killing me how you had a chance to look at some material I did and the interesting thing about it was that couldn&#x27;t figure out a very complex material when you talk to people that are doing this kind of research you find out you know it isn&#x27;t that you know all the elements the periodic table we know about so you&#x27;re not finding some new element that you didn&#x27;t realize was in the periodic table no it&#x27;s more like putting together layered layers of various kinds of material you would expect to be able to be layered and that the result at the end of the day is that it has certain unusual characteristics that you wouldn&#x27;t have predicted in advance so that&#x27;s not the kind of thing that to physicist is the most interesting</p>
