            <p>here you see a disc like craft sort of levitating in the mid-air and you see the pluses and minuses on its Hull represent electric charges and we&#x27;re talking about very high voltages here in the millions of volts now this gets into electrogravidics how you can create gravitational potentials using electric potentials this was discovered by Townsend Brown at the beginning of the 20th century T Townsend Brown best known for the phenomena called the Byfield Brown effect and electrogravidics was an American inventor whose pioneering Research into anti-gravity and electric Fields paved the way for many other scientists and researchers that followed him</p>
