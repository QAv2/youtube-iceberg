            <p>what do you what do you think about Elon Musk and what is he like a Nicola Tesla is he a good guy in your eyes is he somebody that you know the establishment can&#x27;t stand is he someone they can&#x27;t control well I I think that certainly if he was inclined to research this end of it he he wouldn&#x27;t be making a I call it a fake Tesla I mean a real Tesla car wouldn&#x27;t have to be plugged in it most certainly wouldn&#x27;t have 900 and some pounds of lithium ion batteries um it would be an electromagnetic gen you know if you look at this uh archive we have this whole account of of this inventor named Floyd Suite he had something the size a little bit bigger than a cigarette pack and then this was back in the 80s and we have all the documentation on this huge files on it and it was running a 300 horsepower motor that could run your your car and it never had to be plugged in I think the battery started up with some very tiny uh battery you know and once that circuit started it was pulling energy out of What&#x27;s called the quantum vacuum some people call it the Zero Point Energy field but let&#x27;s describe what that is you see your your um your teaglass there that mug the amount of potential energy in the space in that mug is enough energy to boil off all the oceans of the earth it&#x27;s been Quantified and that&#x27;s called the Zero Point Energy field so if you understand understand the physics of these very high voltage vhv we call them very high voltage systems where certain it may be a mill millions of volts but at very low power but at certain cycles per second certain frequencies you can tap into that depends on what material you&#x27;re using to the Aver explain Zer Point Energy to the average person well so visualize just the space around you and everything around you if you get down to uh by classic defin definition it&#x27;s the energy left after even all subatomic particles have been brought down to you know minus 270 some degrees Kelvin uh but there&#x27;s still this energy field that that&#x27;s the Baseline energy field that all of matter space time some atomic particles are fluxing in and out of and interestingly the early locked man-made UFOs were called flux liners because they were tapping into that energy field the quantum flux so that&#x27;s basically it and it&#x27;s huge I mean I think Nikola Tesla called it the infinite energy field and professor dirak and modestly called it the dir C but uh a scientist named Dr Casmir c a s i m r back in the 30s postulated this but then proved its existence in the 50s another important date and that&#x27;s called the cmir effect the sign scientific uh information on that is also in this intelligence archive so you know I wasn&#x27;t even born when when Professor camir proved the existence now what&#x27;s debated amongst scientists currently is that you can tap into it from a practical point of view but you can and and the proof is you know what the proof is look at one of those UFOs moving no Jets no Rockets no internal combustion engines no nuclear no heat signature in fact when you get those things operational temperature actually goes down if you&#x27;re in a hanger with two or three of these things hovering like we have the pictures in our Archive of What&#x27;s called the ARB there at the Norton Air Force Base in 1988 it actually is like an air conditioning it cooled it down so not only do you not have heat coming off of it it actually pulls temperature down somewhat um and so there&#x27;s so many applications of of these Sciences I mean think about it it&#x27;d be free energy Refrigeration cooling server forms Farms if you&#x27;re concerned about climate change for whatever reason but even people who don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s climate change due to pollution there&#x27;s five plus million people a year die from particles from emissions uh coal and gas and oil and not to mention radiation causing cancer from nuclear and all of that would be replaced see p i mean all that&#x27;s gone now that&#x27;s the good news the bad news is is you&#x27;re stepping on the toes of hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets not just the market cap of these big corporations but the Commodities think of what&#x27;s traded on the Chicago Board of Trade you know just in in Futures and commodity training it&#x27;s trillions so all of that you know you&#x27;re not trading Commodities anymore I&#x27;m surprised you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re not studying much of Jamie Diamond or Larry fin or black rock or some of these guys because who is funding all these programs where are they getting the money from oh yeah well well Goldman Sachs and black rock definitely have involvement uh with these operations and um you know the the more current people who are involved the more it&#x27;s shadowy but when people get older or pass away then they start talking let me give you a great example after World War II uh at the end of the war there was a man named Paul melon who was you know the melon Carnegie the melon family one of the few billionaires in the world to in the World War II his grandson has worked with me who was also Senator uh Warr John Warner&#x27;s son and Senator John W was like a lower level operative on this uh majority yes uh and so Paul melon he went over and at the end of World War II with General Patton and Alan Dulles and They confiscated this disc that was uh an early attempt attt to make an electromagnetic anti-gravity thing it wasn&#x27;t fully operational but they brought it back to the United States and how do we know this because towards the end of his life Paul melon H who was very instrumental with Alan dullas informing the CIA and all that stuff remember the OSS became the CIA the OSS during World War II and uh when he was getting older he had had a couple martinis and told his grandson John Warner IV that fact he had gone over there and brought this thing back and that it it was not one of the jet rocket thrusters it was electromagnetic and anti-gravity and so I mean that we&#x27;re talking now the end of World War II in Germany 1945 so that is is something what you find is that as some of these folks get older before they meet their maker as it were they start telling things to me or to other uh family members who who then share it uh so that&#x27;s you know a pattern that in terms of you know I have debriefed you know if you look at this list there&#x27;s 760 whistleblowers and Witnesses but I&#x27;ve met with more some of them I never quite get their name there&#x27;s probably over a thousand but all the people on that list I&#x27;ve debriefed I mean over 34 years so I carry that in my head which is why I&#x27;m trying to put some of this down you know in case something happens to me so if you like this clip and you want to watch another one click right here and if if you want to watch the entire podcast click right here [Music]</p>
