            <p>[music] [music] [music] Good day and welcome to Ross Colt Investigates. So, my friends George Knapp and Jeremy Corbel have come out with a zinger new leaked military drone video, and it&#x27;s a cracker entitled Syria UAP 2021 military filmed footage. It shows a clearly anomalous object moving with extraordinary instantaneous acceleration. And I know the rabbid debunkers will work themselves into a foamy frenzy to try and shoot this one down. And I think they&#x27;re going to have a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So I want to go through the detail of this because I think it&#x27;s a very important new video. I know people get weary of these drone videos, these leaked military videos, but it&#x27;s significant that there are people from the military who are making these videos available to our friends George and Jeremy. And it&#x27;s very significant because I&#x27;m told this is the tip of an iceberg. And let&#x27;s hold the president&#x27;s feet to the fire on his promise made during the presidential campaign before he was reelected where he promised to be more transparent about UAP videos, particularly those held by the military and intelligence community. &gt;&gt; [gasps] &gt;&gt; So, this footage originates from a 2021 incident shot from an MQ9 Reaper drones multi-spectral targeting system, which is a high-end sensor platform used for surveillance and targeting.</p>
<p>And what it shows is a small orblike object that appears as a bright heat emitting anomaly against a cooler background. And it&#x27;s being actively tracked by the drone during a routine patrol mission. Now, I spent a lot of time looking at this area cuz I&#x27;ve driven through both the Syrian and Jordanian desert on my way to Baghdad. And it&#x27;s a pretty empty, soulless part of the world. There&#x27;s not much there.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s flat, empty land. And so initially I was wondering whether there might be any relationship between the weapons of mass destruction facilities that were being constructed by the Syrians in secret that were eventually knocked out by both I suspect combined Israeli and American operations. And unfortunately for the theory, my hypothesis is blown up in my face. There is no evidence at all that there&#x27;s any link at all to any of these weapons of mass destruction facilities. They&#x27;re much much further towards Damascus.</p>
<p>This particular location is probably about a 100 miles souths southwest of Damascus sitting in the middle of nowhere in the desert the the Syrian desert just across the border from Jordan. What is interesting is in terms of relatively interesting locations nearby. There&#x27;s the Israeli Deona nuclear facility. The Israeli nuclear site, which is almost certainly will definitely has nuclear weapons, is probably about 200 plus miles just across to the what would that be? Southwest of or west of where this location was. So, I can&#x27;t see any link.</p>
<p>But what is amazing about this video is what it shows. It&#x27;s captured in black and white thermographic forwardlooking infrared flur mode by this Reaper drone. Um, and if you have a look at it, it it basically appears as a bright heat emitting anomaly against a cooler background. And the Reaper establishes what&#x27;s called a weapons quality lock on the object, meaning the systems crosshairs stabilize on top of it for precise observation or engagement. And in the let&#x27;s say the first one and a half minutes.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s go through the first one and a half minutes. It&#x27;s called the initial tracking if you like. Firstly, the object looks stationary. It seems to be moving slowly in the drone&#x27;s field of vision. The the sensor platform adjusts focus and zoom and then it starts maintaining a steady lock.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no visible propulsion. And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so exciting about this because that&#x27;s clearly one of the five observables which distinguishes UAPs from prosaically explained objects. There&#x27;s no exhaust. There&#x27;s no plumes. There&#x27;s no rotors.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no wings. There&#x27;s no thermal signature. There&#x27;s no heat trails from the engines if there are engines. The object maintains a constant consistent spherical or domelike appearance in the thermal imaging. It&#x27;s got no discernable flight control surfaces.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no flaps. There&#x27;s no tail. It&#x27;s fascinating. It&#x27;s just a sphere. How does a sphere propel itself through the sky? At around about a minute 30, it starts doing abrupt maneuvers for about the next 45 seconds.</p>
<p>It begins exhibiting subtle directional changes, including slight lateral drifts and minor altitude changes without any apparent buildup in speed or energy output. What it suggests is it&#x27;s got a response. It&#x27;s responding intelligently and it seems to be evading as if it&#x27;s reacting to the drone&#x27;s lock, which is fascinating. How is an object aware of the lock on by a distant MQ reaper drone? Clearly, whatever this technology is, it&#x27;s very sophisticated and we want it. The next thing that&#x27;s really interesting, and this starts about 2 minutes 15 in, and this is where things really get interesting.</p>
<p>At about 2 minutes 15, you see instantaneous acceleration. And not just acceleration, this is super duper acceleration. In this climactic sequence, the object suddenly accelerates out of frame at an extreme velocity. This transition happens in about a second with no gradual ramp up in speed. It literally is instantaneous acceleration.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no sonic boom indicators. There&#x27;s no afterglow. There&#x27;s no heat residue. The drone&#x27;s sensor actually struggles to acquire the target even though it&#x27;s locked on and it pans rapidly, but it fails to keep up, underscoring the superior performance of whatever that object is. Now, the video includes text overlaying it, which identifies it just as Syria UAP 2021.</p>
<p>So, we we don&#x27;t know the month, the day. It&#x27;s got timestamps and coordinates and sensor data. There are zoom levels and tracking modes. The audio narration from Jeremy and George provides context um emphasizing that the footage is authentic. I&#x27;m quite sure it is and the fact that it&#x27;s come from within US intelligence community channels.</p>
<p>They describe the object, the UAP, as exhibiting intelligent control. And note that its origin, its intent, and its capabilities are completely unknown. The overall narrative frames this as evidence of intelligent nonhuman technology. And who are we to argue? Because it&#x27;s clear from the intelligence community&#x27;s own categorization of this object that they too accept that this is a UAP. It&#x27;s going to be great fun watching the Pentagon&#x27;s UA UAP Debunk Office, Arrow, the all domain anomaly resolution office, disgrace itself by tying itself up in knots and trying to debunk this particular video, which they&#x27;ve done in the past on other videos which are clearly anomalous.</p>
<p>Now, I guess we should also ask what does the video not show? So, there are limitations with this kind of thermal imaging. It doesn&#x27;t have visible light. You don&#x27;t see color. So, the object&#x27;s material composition, whether it&#x27;s got a metallic sheen to it, the surface details, the exact shape beyond the orb shape can&#x27;t be discerned. There&#x27;s no audio at all from the incident.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s basically mute. There&#x27;s no engine sounds or or radio chatter. So, we we don&#x27;t know if there was a screaming turbine pushing this along. I somehow doubt it because if there was a turbine, we&#x27;d see heat and there&#x27;s no heat. So, it seems to be just sensor data only.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no pre or postevent context such as how the UAP entered the area, whether it was detected on radar beforehand or where it went after accelerating away. And there&#x27;s no interaction beyond passive tracking. There&#x27;s no attempts to engage or intercept it. Mercifully, we didn&#x27;t try and shoot it down this time like the most recent object which we apparently deployed a kinetic missile against. There&#x27;s no size scale.</p>
<p>The estimates suggest it&#x27;s quite small, perhaps drone sized, but that&#x27;s unconfirmed. And the altitude depth data is pretty limited beyond basic coordinates. It seems most of the time to be flying at about 1,700 ft. And of course, there&#x27;s no evidence of occupants or any kind of entity being human operating it. We just don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no environmental effects. It doesn&#x27;t land on the ground. [gasps] So, does it comply with the five observables? These are the five ways that we assess whether an object is a UAP. And the answer to that is absolutely it does. The most important one, of course, first is anti-gravity.</p>
<p>anti-gravity lift. It&#x27;s partially demonstrated the object&#x27;s hovering or maneuvering without any visible means of propulsion. There&#x27;s no rotors. There&#x27;s no jets. There&#x27;s nothing discernible emitting any kind of heat that might imply they have conventional mechanical propulsion to allow them to defy gravity.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s defying gravity through, let&#x27;s call it, unknown means. There&#x27;s no inertial effects or any structural strain visible during the acceleration which is clearly a huge pace of acceleration. The issue of instantaneous acceleration absolutely that&#x27;s demonstrated. The the core anomaly is the fact that the object goes from essentially near stationary to extreme speeds. And the way we can assess that is by looking how quickly it&#x27;s moving relative to the ground and the fact of course that the Reaper drone, one of the most sophisticated pieces of technology in the US arsenal, its lockon is incapable of tracking it, of keeping up with it because the acceleration is so fast.</p>
<p>Um, there are clearly G forces here which do not appear to have any discernable effect on the object would be far beyond human tolerances or current aircraft limits. An F-35 is probably about 9G max. This is way beyond 9G. So this whole event occurs without any acceleration buildup. There&#x27;s no deceleration artifacts.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no thermal buildup. It&#x27;s what you would call politely to use the euphemism nonnewtonian propulsion. The next thing is there are hypersonic velocities without any signatures. And that&#x27;s very obvious. Post acceleration the object achieves a speed that&#x27;s estimated at hypersonic levels.</p>
<p>So multiple [clears throat] mark maybe mark five plus five times the speed of sound. Yet there&#x27;s no plasma sheath which you frankly would expect at that speed. There&#x27;s no heat trail. There&#x27;s no sonic boom. The signatures that would normally accompany hypersonic vehicles like this just aren&#x27;t evident.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also not showing low observability. So, the one thing that is another characteristic of the five observables is stealth mode, and that doesn&#x27;t really seem to be showing. Um, the UAP is visible all the way throughout. It&#x27;s trackable in thermal imaging. We don&#x27;t know though whether it enabled itself to evade visual identification with normal cameras that can see in visible light.</p>
<p>We just don&#x27;t know because all we&#x27;re looking at here is in IR light. [gasps] And the other one, the other five observables of course is transmedium travel. And that&#x27;s not demonstrated because we&#x27;re over a desert. There&#x27;s no water. There&#x27;s no um orbit position where it can go into orbit.</p>
<p>So at the moment, it&#x27;s just moving through the air. But in and of itself, the movement it&#x27;s showing is clearly anomalous. Now, I watched Merrick von Renenamp, our good friend here on Reality Check, who&#x27;s a bit of an expert on this stuff, and he was very excited on the episode of Weaponized that first broadcast this story and video, and he&#x27;s basically of the view that this is indeed an anomalous object. Um, he said it was mind-boggling and consistent with pilot eyewitness reports from previous events of instantaneous acceleration. And I do think that the significance of this video is what it demonstrates about instantaneous acceleration.</p>
<p>This is very very important. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to the ding-dong that we&#x27;re going to have clearly with the usual round of debunkers probably in the pay of the Pentagon who will do their level best to tie themselves up in knots and try and debunk this object. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to win. Um I have observed it&#x27;s almost definitely a seagull, but for those of you who do take me literally, I was joking. There are a few people on social media who seem to think I was being serious.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not a seagull. It&#x27;s definitely a UAP. So, it is definitely anomalous. Um, the skeptics did argue that the acceleration could have just been an an evidence of the drone&#x27;s sensor losing lock during a motion blur or a panning event and that it&#x27;s not showing true object speed. But, Merrick did a very good counter to that.</p>
<p>He made the point that the um uh weaponsgrade lock and l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l lack of artifacts in and similar systems doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s a loss of speed um they&#x27;ve also tried to suggest that it might be a Syrian or Iranian drone and I&#x27;m sorry this doesn&#x27;t wash the intelligence community itself has categorized this as a UAP purely and simply because of the performance metrics of this object drones do not fly with instantaneous acceleration or hypersonic speeds. If the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians have got this object. If it&#x27;s Syrian, God help us all because it means they&#x27;ve developed a type of technology that is far beyond known human kin. There is no debunk yet that has successfully shot down this object with a prosaic explanation. Um, the Pentagon, of course, as usual, has not made any comment.</p>
<p>It must annoy them intensely that Jeremy and George clearly have sources who are leaking them these videos. And I hope Jeremy and George have got their remaining videos tucked away nice and tightly far away from defense security. Um, I don&#x27;t see why, frankly, now that we&#x27;ve seen this video, why it can&#x27;t be publicly released. And this shows the lie to the Pentagon&#x27;s current effort to try and conceal and hide these videos from the public. Why can&#x27;t the public see this? It doesn&#x27;t betray any capabilities that ought not properly be revealed.</p>
<p>Yes, an MQ9 Reaper drone was unable to lock onto this object because it moved so fast. That&#x27;s significant, but it doesn&#x27;t betray any kind of national security secret because frankly, it&#x27;s not showing the performance parameters of the MQ Reaper drone. We don&#x27;t know how fast the object was moving before the Reaper lost contact. That might be the only plausible reason I can think of for why the public wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to know about this video. So, frankly, the the most interesting thing to me about this video is what it reveals about the Pentagon and intelligence community&#x27;s continued deceit to try and hide these videos from the public.</p>
<p>And well done Jeremy and George, and particularly well done to their sources for providing this v video for public attention. Um I I do think uh any explanation that might put this in context. I mean I was looking at the events in Syria at the time and of course that there was the ongoing Syrian civil war but I couldn&#x27;t think of any reason for why there might be anything other than the usual routine surveillance in that part of the Syrian desert in 2021. It was an open secret that the Americans were surveilling the Syrians because of course we were worried very worried about them deploying weapons of mass destruction against Israel. And uh more importantly there was a brutal civil war going on where that dictator Assad was just going around brutally murdering people in some of the towns that are much further to the northwest from where this incident took place.</p>
<p>So there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any incident historically from that time that might explain why this UAP was moving in the area. As I&#x27;ve already explained, the Demonia Deona nuclear weapons facility uh is probably a couple of hundred miles to the probably southwest from where this location was. So we don&#x27;t know where this object was moving to or from because the video doesn&#x27;t exactly say what direction it was moving in. But it&#x27;s a mystery. What we can say for sure is this is a UAP.</p>
<p>Even the Pentagon accepts that. And why the hell were they keeping this secret?</p>
