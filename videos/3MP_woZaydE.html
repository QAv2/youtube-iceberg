            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[Music] Hello everyone. This is Dark Journalist with a very special interview for you tonight with Antarctica Rathon whistleblower Eric Hecker. Eric&#x27;s bombshell information on the nutrino effect and its relationship to space communications in the UFO file is shaking the wall of secrecy to its foundation. Antarctica, the great mystery since Operation High Jump and Admiral Bird may be revealed tonight. &gt;&gt; Eric, it&#x27;s great to have you here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for having me, Daniel. I&#x27;ve been looking forward to this for a very long time. um as I&#x27;ve mentioned to you before that you&#x27;re um you&#x27;re the only person that I see covering the Antarctic topic appropriately and and trying to connect the dots uh to some of the most peculiar aspects of disclosure that are being wholly ignored. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no question there&#x27;s a gigantic mystery uh there and I appreciate it. I appreciated uh you know covering your work because you really have put a culmination to so many of the things that were going on in the background going all the way back to bird and high jump and some of the things you observed actually being on the ground in Antarctica I think is so valuable uh and the research that came later and all of the strange circumstances but let&#x27;s get into that now.</p>
<p>uh what I want you to do is take us just on a journey about how you connected with Antarctica in the first place and then we&#x27;ll get into the deeper uh aspects as we go along. &gt;&gt; Absolutely sir. Um it was back in um the the debacle of the real estate bubble bursting around 2008ish that the um you know I had I had a small you know service plumbing company on Long Island doing plumbing and heating repairs 24 hours a day and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where I was at at the time you know after having a career working for other people and and um very peculiar facilities all over Long Island TRW AIL SIC Grin Paul Corporation um both you know the facility ities and and the people that owned these, you know, facilities. So, I had a very peculiar client list. But when um when things were fading financially there, I had to start, you know, broadening my horizons.</p>
<p>And where else can I find work? Um, oddly enough, um the only place on the planet that I was able to get to cut me a check and give me a contract was was Rathon Polar Services. So, I I wound up signing up with those folks. I went down um to Centennial, Colorado for some training and testing and all that type of stuff, psychological evaluations and um fire brigade training um emergency um first responder stuff, Wilson Medicine, Wilderness Medicine Institute, NLES, and just a whole bunch of, you know, training and prepping. And then effectively they flew us down uh to Christ Church, New Zealand, then to McMmero station. This was in November of 2010.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, I wound up making it to pole that November and I was on site uh 366 days straight on the ice um before I departed in November of 2011. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s incredible. Um what is it like to be in Antarctica? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really it&#x27;s really hard to give it the words that it deserves. Um it&#x27;s there&#x27;s nothing there.</p>
<p>I mean, when you land at South Pole, um when they when they open up the door to the Herk &gt;&gt; and that atmosphere comes in, it is like a punch in the face. It was minus50° ambient when we arrived. Um, it&#x27;s 0% humidity, super low oxygen. So, you know, we exit the plane and they have, you know, that your gear is on a an Air Force pallet on the ice already and you&#x27;re supposed to go over and grab your stuff and carry it in. &gt;&gt; And I mean, I was I was 36 years old at the time and and perfectly fit, you know, working in the trades and, you know, having a good understanding of, you know, what I could accomplish physically.</p>
<p>And then I I went over to grab my stuff and I I I felt like an emphyma patient. It was like just like, you know, everything was heavy and hard to lift. And I it was so funny because I remember um there was a girl that had come out of the elevated station that had wintered over. &gt;&gt; And I knew this because she had almost no cold weather gear on. She had just like, you know, like a a thermal, a t-shirt, you know, a hat on her head, gloves on her hands, like no skin exposed.</p>
<p>um except for her face, but no like jacket or anything cuz in her mind&#x27;s eye, she was just coming out and going in and grabbing people&#x27;s stuff and helping. &gt;&gt; And she just started grabbing bags and humping them into the building with great ease. And I remember thinking to myself like, I wish she would carry me in, you know, but how how&#x27;s it going to look if on the first day, you know, the first chick I meet, I&#x27;m like, can you throw me over your shoulder and bring me in? Don&#x27;t tell HR I said that. Well, that&#x27;s great. Well, she I guess you know the training and everything just acclimating to the whole place.</p>
<p>She had it. But &gt;&gt; absolutely. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s fascinating. &gt;&gt; Yeah, she was totally acclimated. &gt;&gt; Did you um did you get a sense for like, you know, the idea of when Bird first hit with his expedition there? Did you get a feel for what it was like just the environment? And I know there there&#x27;s a great deal of difference.</p>
<p>there&#x27;s like 70 years difference between when he went there, &gt;&gt; but um just that feeling of being out on the edge of the universe kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Um the being in the environment puts a lot of stuff in context. So I feel that I do understand a lot more of where bird and other you know previous old Antarctic explorers minds were at. Um, granted, you know, for what we had for a facility would been considered super lush and easy for them, &gt;&gt; but you can you can immediately respect that without these facilities in this infrastructure, it&#x27;s just ice hell.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, so you get you you immediately have things put in perspective because you can look in one direction and you can see um the elevated station and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Yay, we can live there.&quot; But you could just turn and look in the other direction and you see the nothingness and you can immediately imagine the horror it would have had to have been to trek in there with the gear that they had. Um, one of the coolest experiences that I had was in my summer season. Um, they set us up in the conference room and we actually wound up there was there was some sort of a reunion that was going on for the original military crew that was the first winter overs in 1957. &gt;&gt; Oh wow.</p>
<p>and we got to do a conference call with them and they were sharing their stories with us of what it was like for them to show up and and set up the first facility to ever winter at the South Pole station &gt;&gt; and that&#x27;s geohysical year. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The whole IGY which is still shrouded in secrecy and probably never really ended. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which was started by Burkner if I recall.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yes. And it&#x27;s interesting he came up with the idea in 1950, seven years, &gt;&gt; seven years in construction and uh of course it coincides with satellites and everything. It&#x27;s just oh so convenience. Uh yeah and it never the funding the funding for it never ended.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, that&#x27;s the United States Antarctic program now operating under the opaces of the National Science Foundation. &gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. And this is what&#x27;s fascinating to me because that corridor for funding is there even without the black budget part which we&#x27;ll get into. Um, so you&#x27;re there and you&#x27;re in the middle of this whole mystery and you you&#x27;re working. You have this full-time job.</p>
<p>You are basically the all-around guy there. You&#x27;re the contractor. You&#x27;re the fireman, electrician, plumber, everything that they need. And so it gives you access to all different parts of the facility. &gt;&gt; We did technically have a a full complement of specialists.</p>
<p>Um we, you know, I was effectively the plumber slash um fire brigade team lead. Um but we did have electricians. Um um you know, we had vehicle maintenance folks, but basically the way things that worked was that if if something broke and it was a plumbing issue, I would take lead and then the other trades would be like my apprentices. And then vice versa, if it was a massive electrical failure, the electrician, he takes lead and then we all help. Um and that would be when I would say there was like a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>Um, so I was hired as a as a plumber by contract, but in the that would be more for the summer season that I was very specific to that role. Um, during the winter season when we dropped down to a skeleton crew, I operated in a department known as FEMC, facilities, engineering, maintenance, and construction. And in that capacity, in the wintertime, I was operating under a role that would they called a UT, a utilities technician. So, in the normal operations, non-emergency stuff, um, yeah, I could get involved with little rinky dink, you know, electrical repairs, you know, if the electrician&#x27;s doing a big overhaul somewhere down, you know, in the facility. Um, and we have a light switch go out.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course. I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll take care of that. You&#x27;re busy, &gt;&gt; you know, that type of stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um, so that was normal operations.</p>
<p>We did a lot of, you know, just um &gt;&gt; preventative maintenance checks. I mean, we we pretty much had to go into every room in every building every day &gt;&gt; to just check make sure everything&#x27;s okay, you know, make sure nothing&#x27;s squeaking or creaking or smoking or, you know, just check everything. It was obligatory because any failure that occurred there um would cascade very rapidly. We would always say, you know, we have to get something fixed rapidly because like mother nature&#x27;s now encroaching and she&#x27;s ruthless at the South Pole. I mean, that was one of the things that I realized um during my winter season.</p>
<p>Like often times I I was literally like Lieutenant Dan in Forest Gump like out in white out conditions trying to walk to another building and screaming into the wind at Mother Nature like you&#x27;re not going to get me today because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s obvious that mother nature has designed that area for nothing to be alive. &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; She doesn&#x27;t want anything to be alive there.</p>
<p>And you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going against that every step, every second. And it&#x27;s, you know, I I had a lot of conversations where I didn&#x27;t speak nicely to her. Exactly. Uh you&#x27;re there in this capacity and over time, let&#x27;s say some unusual things happen or you witness some different types of technologies that are used, which you have no idea what they are back there. when you leave, it starts to occur to you.</p>
<p>Oh, I I was witnessing some very, very strange things while I was there. How long is the arc there before it starts to sink in that there were very strange things that you witnessed? &gt;&gt; Actually, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s close to completely accurate with the only caveat being is that I did discover the ELF system was wholly functional while I was present in the facility &gt;&gt; and I had a short stint in the submarine service. So, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m very aware of the potentials of what the ELF can be utilized for. And we were told initially that that system um was off and not operational, but in my in my duties, I had a repair to do where I I learned that that system was up and running. Um so, even while I was there, I was like kind of floored that I was like, I knew it.</p>
<p>I knew Rathon was up to something here. Yeah. you know, but then uh in regards to the other technologies when I did get off of the ice, yes, it did take a few years for me to start connecting the dots and the um I guess you would say the motivation for that um activity was when I started to notice some issues with my health and then I started having other crew members reach out to me that they were having issues with their health. Mhm. &gt;&gt; At the time we weren&#x27;t familiar with the Havana syndrome stuff or AHI as they&#x27;re calling it now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So we were just trying to figure out like what&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on like what happened. &gt;&gt; Um certainly I have no love loss on Rathon. I consider them the devil incarnate in corporate form. So for them to have damaged us without telling us just it seemed like par for the course and very reasonable logic. Um, you know, we had a lot of issues with Rathon even, you know, while we were on site.</p>
<p>So, this to me just seemed like a continuation of they effed us over hard yet again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, it&#x27;s this defense contractor with low regard for the people that are working there and subjecting them to very hazardous conditions. Um, what is the kind of main symptom you would say that came out of this for you? So, you&#x27;re exposed to this machine. Some members of the crew are exposed to the ELF and what starts to happen? &gt;&gt; First and foremost, I would say it seems almost the entire list from myself and the folks on the crew, but if you want to go into like say um main issues, I would say like um unnecessary fatigue, um brain fog, you know, and I I know people I mean, if you&#x27;re not suffering this stuff, it might sound like it&#x27;s nothing.</p>
<p>Um but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the weirdest thing in the world um to have to go through. &gt;&gt; Um skin issues have been reported by other crew members. Um you know, cognitive decline prematurely, you know. So again, these things don&#x27;t sound that terrible um until it&#x27;s happening to you. But this is also why I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve also come out because what occurred to my crew um because we were in proximity and you know probably being wholly tested on by Rathon because they didn&#x27;t give a damn about us.</p>
<p>Um but it&#x27;s my belief that these directed energy weapons platforms are now being um more broadly applied to the general population. And I often suggest to people, you know, pay attention to your loved ones. Learn what the symptoms are on the Havana symptom syndrome symptoms list and start paying attention to your own loved ones because truly we&#x27;re only going to be able to be the judges and jury on the discrepancies because they they happen gradually and and people are changing in the general community now. Like I&#x27;m I would say I&#x27;m witnessing the people around me in the general population suffering these symptoms. But if you don&#x27;t know someone&#x27;s firing a weapon at you and it&#x27;s invisible, you don&#x27;t realize that you&#x27;re now the modern walking wounded.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Interesting. Wow. Uh and Havana syndrome of course was picked up initially by these government workers after we reestablished the em embassy there in Cuba. And somebody didn&#x27;t want that to happen. And they started to come down with things like they would call them microwave concussions.</p>
<p>One of the weird things that I noticed um in those stories, if you go into it, is after the personnel were called back to the United States, the symptoms continued. The syndrome continued to stalk them. &gt;&gt; And that sounds like it&#x27;s the same thing in your experience. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think of it again like from my my submarine experience, I I&#x27;m cognizant that, you know, you can get a sound signature off of anything and then at that point that&#x27;s that&#x27;s your target. you know, you just you just dial in.</p>
<p>So, once they got your number, it doesn&#x27;t really matter where you go and and once you&#x27;re part of the experiment and you&#x27;re unbeknownst, I mean, there there&#x27;s no reason for them to stop. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Absolutely. And some of those aspects that get into mind control and things are interesting.</p>
<p>You brought them up and I will I am going to ask you about those. What I want to ask you about is has been something central that you observed. It has to do with this nutrino uh ice cube detector and the the strange technology that&#x27;s associated with it and then the aspect of observing this earthquake take place in Christ Church as a result of this exotic technology. Bring us into that and how it started to you know you put the pieces together that the things people were telling you when you were there were directly related to this earthquake that took place. &gt;&gt; Fair enough.</p>
<p>And that that was um an aspect that I I would say I connected the dots after the fact. Albeit I was I was present when the ice cube nutrino detector, ice cube lab sometimes it&#x27;s called um and the elevated station were transitioning from their construction phases um to operations and maintenance. I was officially the first crew to function either of those facilities in operations and maintenance. So the Ice Cube Nutrino facility went online when I was present. &gt;&gt; 2011, is that right? &gt;&gt; Feb February of 2011 was when it effectively started coming online and that was when the earthquakes occurred in Christ Church, New Zealand.</p>
<p>It was a big deal for the Antarctic program because we had just switched from summer operations to winter operations. We had a ton of personnel transiting through Christ Church. There&#x27;s a big, you know, try to try to find the missing personnel. There was all kinds of call lists and if if you&#x27;ve seen this person, let us know. And they were, you know, going through it.</p>
<p>It was a very big deal. &gt;&gt; But it wasn&#x27;t until years later when I was communicating with former crew members and again, I was suspect of um people on my crew operating under false pretenses. Let&#x27;s just say spooks. I mean, I just to me in my experience, it it there was no way that certain people on that crew weren&#x27;t spooks. And I was aware of that the entire time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They were undercover. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And I&#x27;ve spoken to folks like Walter Bosley who, you know, we&#x27;ve engaged and discussed exactly how these types of things work and they show up and say, &quot;I&#x27;m the electrician.&quot; but they&#x27;re actually there, you know, for AFOSCI to, you know, check for leaks, you know, to make sure that there&#x27;s not intelligence getting out. So, um, even in my conversations with Walter, I said, you know, if there if if you could have gotten a job, because he has said on air, you know, that he had applied to go to Antarctica. So, I I caught that as a little red flag to me and I was like, Walter, like, &gt;&gt; what do you mean you guys had an option to go to Antarctica? I said, and he explained, well, you know, yeah, I would have been under false pretenses.</p>
<p>I would have shown up as an airman, you know, or a fueler or whatever, but effectively he was intelligence, right? And I said to him, I said, if if that&#x27;s the case, Walter, I said, if the Air Force would do that for a benign project, I said, hypothetically, if everything that I&#x27;m saying is true and there&#x27;s more nefarious activities going on, I said, wouldn&#x27;t there be like a guy like you doing that for that project? He was like, oh, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I think we I think we had those guys &gt;&gt; and in the um post um ICE deployment when we started communicating that there were health issues um and people were asking me to put all of my cards on the table, you know, for the benefit of our crew and our health and what can we accomplish? Um I demanded reciprocity &gt;&gt; to put all your cards on the table. I said I I know that there was more going on at your desk. So, it was in these communications um that I basically got read into what was really going on, which was the directed energies weapons capacity of the facility um which made total sense as to &gt;&gt; why we were having health issues and there was um a lot of situations that we then discussed um where I now know that we were lied to.</p>
<p>Um, we would run mass casualty incident drills. You know, again, I was a a a high-ranking member of the emergency response team, the fire brigade that I was on, I was effectively always the first person to breach the door into what we would call the red zone. We followed the FEMA incident management protocols and basically uh team two frier brigade would would breach the area after team one would go and um you know, basically the alarms would go off. I would run to my my gear locker, start bunkering up full SCBA and get ready to fight fires and and rescue victims. Team one was the first responders.</p>
<p>They would basically go immediately to the location that was u ringing the alarm and they would confirm that it&#x27;s a legitimate alarm and they would secure the area and they would start defining what we would call a red zone, a yellow zone, and a green zone. Basically, hot, warm, and cold zone. So the only people that can go into the red zone had to be on on air full full SCBA. And that was my job was once the red zone was declared, I would have to go in with the resources that I would dictate to to mitigate the problem. Um, every one of the aspects of the facility I had to get trained up on.</p>
<p>when we had to have standard operating procedures, emergency access plans, what&#x27;s in there, what can hurt people, what has to be deenergized, um you know, what kind of compressed gases are in there, all kinds of stuff. So, um there are some drills that we did where um as an example, out in a communications area, um one of the radar domes, we were we were setting up a drill to do a mass casualty incident event out there because it was kind of like at the outskirts of the property, kind of really far away from the elevated facility, and the resources would all have to be transited there. It was it was a logistical nightmare in those temperatures for our SCBAs were not designed for that. The equipment is, you know, challenging. You can run a piston bully out there, but you can&#x27;t park it.</p>
<p>You got to keep it moving, you know, circling around and stuff like that. So, it was it was really a a test to put us through the ringer and and test our gear and stuff. In that process when we were getting the emergency action plan together, one of the, you know, checked boxes that we had to do was that, you know, before we go into this ray dome, it has to be deenergized. We can&#x27;t send personnel into this thing when it&#x27;s transmitting, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, I found out &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. It&#x27;s RF frequency poisoning and stuff like that.</p>
<p>but it already has signs on the door like do not enter when transmitting, you know, dangerous for personnel. So, you know, we took this into consideration. Um, and everybody agreed that all right, you know, that&#x27;s going to have to be deenergized for the drill. And, you know, it was all part of the process. Well, I I found out in in hindsight years later, they just lied to us.</p>
<p>It turned out that it was um it was too necessary to keep the equipment on apparently. &gt;&gt; Oh. So that when we did the drill um and we called in, you know, I&#x27;m at the door ready to breach and I call in. I said, &quot;Okay, you know, deenergized the system. We&#x27;re getting ready to breach the door and I got a call back.</p>
<p>You know, the system has be has been deenergized. It is safe for you to enter the building.&quot; Well, what I learned years later was they just they just lied. &gt;&gt; They&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah, just tell them just tell them we deenergized it.&quot; And it&#x27;s fascinating because um when you get into those types of things, they could have been checking you out medically and seeing what kind of effects were taking place and all the rest of it. They get all that data while exposing uh you to that whole thing. What is the strangest piece about the earthquake taking place there during the test in that there was some rumors uh around the base I presume or just among your crew that the test uh that they were doing on the nutrino effect was the direct result of what took place with the earthquake but it wasn&#x27;t intentional but then later you discovered oh no no it was it was intentional &gt;&gt; yeah so I would say at the time that I was on the ice and present that there there weren&#x27;t rumors running around at that moment that we had inst induced the earthquake.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t until later on. But when I was going over things with the crew, the original idea that I was being told was that it was an accident &gt;&gt; and it was it was a it was friendly fire and it was just because that, you know, they didn&#x27;t have it dialed in yet, &gt;&gt; you know, so they had to, you know, work on their targeting so to say. Um, but just like I I I no longer believe the rayome was turned off for our mass casualty incident that they lied about it. Um, I think they lied about that, too. I I think there is a possibility that it was on purpose.</p>
<p>And I I had come across a document um that was a Wikileaks document that was apparently from the desk of Hillary Clinton. And I&#x27;m going to I&#x27;m going to paraphrase a little bit. Um, but the concept of this email was was it was referencing the earthquakes in Christ Church, New Zealand in February of 2011. And she said something to the effect of that she was happy that it occurred and on Q. &gt;&gt; Oh yes.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; So that changed. &gt;&gt; That tells you a great deal there. Secretary of State. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Huh. you um when you think about that, what do you think is taking place there? We&#x27;ve heard now all the way back to uh you know, particle beam weapons and Nicola Tesla in 1903 uh simulated an earthquake in Manhattan on a dare and the police made him stop, right? &gt;&gt; So, this this has been around the idea of creating earthquakes, creating weather events and the whole disaster capitalism that goes along with it. But this one basically is you have this test going on by Rathon there in Antarctica and it results directly somehow because it&#x27;s aimed at Christ Church in the in the earthquake there and then you know whether it&#x27;s accidental or they did it on purpose as a test and and it seems like they did it on purpose.</p>
<p>Um we&#x27;ve seen over and over again there are little hints that some of these major earthquake events are being caused by this technology. What do you think it is in the technology? Uh, and would you say definitively that you think we possess a deed that can set off an earthquake? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I believe that we do. I I believe it&#x27;s right at South Pole Station. This is why I fight this battle is that everybody is saying, you know, if this if this stuff was true, if somebody knew something, they would say something.</p>
<p>Well, I am &gt;&gt; because I know something. So, I&#x27;m saying something, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. This is this is what&#x27;s called actionable intelligence, &gt;&gt; right? You know, a lot of these other whistleblowers are out there and they&#x27;re not really giving actionable intelligence, right? The way I look at it is like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not a lawyer. I&#x27;m not the judge and jury, right? But I am providing enough actionable intelligence that if there was to be a grand jury, they&#x27;d be able to indict and move forwards and do an investigation, which is what I went to Washington DC for in good faith. Is I don&#x27;t believe that I have the whole case locked, stock, and barrel, &gt;&gt; but I&#x27;ve provided enough actionable intelligence that it deserves people looking into this further.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;re bringing in that huge puzzle piece and it&#x27;s coming in from a very obscure corner which is Antarctica and the the testing that&#x27;s going on down there, the presence of the defense contractors like Rathon, Loheed Martin, and others. Um, and the secrecy levels that they&#x27;re under, not to mention the fact that if you really get into the history there, the UFO file aspect comes into that. I&#x27;m going to get into that with you. What I want to ask you um on this is when you went to Washington and they put you in a skiff to to give this information. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; yeah, two of them.</p>
<p>One was the Senate Intelligence Committee and one was Arrow. &gt;&gt; Oh, fascinating. Uh and Arrow, of course, set up directly to get to the bottom of the UFO file originally and uh you know, turned out to be a complete whitewash. &gt;&gt; Totally. Did you what was your impression of the people you were giving the information to and do you think they received it on the level that you were delivering it? &gt;&gt; It was it was funny how diametrically opposed those skiffs were.</p>
<p>The um the Senate Intelligence Committee skiff was run by Kirk McConnell, who I didn&#x27;t know at the time. I had no idea who he was. I from my perspective that day, I just thought he was like a really smart scientist. That was really nice. Like he was very smiley.</p>
<p>He was very amicable. Um but he was like a kid in the candy store. You know, I spread out all of my information all over the table. There was there was other people in the room, but he was the one basically running it. He was like the point of contact for everyone else.</p>
<p>He was asking the questions. People had questions for me. they would ask him first and he would kind of give his interpretation and then and redistribute the information back. So that was fantastic that skiff like I left there um feeling like I had accomplished something and that it was worth me going to Washington DC. Um they absolutely, you know, thanked me for my, you know, braveness to testify, told me my information was going to be put in the National Archives and, you know, we&#x27;re going to get to the bottom of this, you know, but the um the folks at Arrow, it was just it was like everything that I was telling them was nowhere near anything they heard before.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t know how to connect it to anything. They were just like just &gt;&gt; question askers, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that it was um that one was a a bit more disheartening because it just seemed like um you know that my information was it wasn&#x27;t that so much that it was falling on on deaf ears so to say. It was just falling on um we&#x27;ll go biblical those people had neither eyes to see nor ears to hear.</p>
<p>They didn&#x27;t know what was going on when I was talking. &gt;&gt; All right. Right. And that could be the position coming in that, you know, we can neither confirm nor deny, so we&#x27;re just going to sit here and ask you the questions like we don&#x27;t know anything. Um, but it&#x27;s also interesting to consider that if they&#x27;re that out of the loop, &gt;&gt; then, you know, there&#x27;s so few people that come directly from a facility or having worked for a defense contractor in Antarctica who can come out and say this.</p>
<p>And you know, we&#x27;ve had some kind of fluff stuff that&#x27;s come out that said, &quot;Hey, there&#x27;s a pyramid over here, you know, and that kind of things.&quot; And uh, you know, I believe some of the stories that go back around Pyramid of Alaska and things of that nature, but nothing Antarctica, in my opinion, it&#x27;s harder to get real genuine intelligence out of there than it is on the moon. You know, it&#x27;s so &gt;&gt; uh remote and under such a veil of secrecy because of its importance. And the question of why it&#x27;s so important intrigues me. One of our mutual friends, John Warner IV, talks a great deal about his dad, who was Secretary of the Navy and a great senator from Virginia. And in conversations with him, even he was holding out and being highly secretive, but he indicated that the program that he was involved in, Deep Freeze, in Antarctica, was related directly to space.</p>
<p>Mhm. &gt;&gt; And um so I want to get into your research around that. You&#x27;ve been there. You&#x27;ve been in the middle of that malstrm of the secrecy. &gt;&gt; What is it that relates Antarctica to space in your opinion &gt;&gt; that um besides the ability to induce earthquakes from the ice cube facility that um how do we how do I put this? So you know we&#x27;ll just say UFOs.</p>
<p>Um, obviously there&#x27;s off-world ones. I&#x27;m not opposed to there being life in the cosmos and them having ships, and I&#x27;m not opposed to them coming here. Um, but I believe that would be the most minute um amount of observations of the activities that we&#x27;re seeing. I believe most of the stuff that we see is man-made technology. That&#x27;s just monopolized technology.</p>
<p>And there, you know, they&#x27;re hiding it away so that it&#x27;s unregulated. But those all of these vehicles that we&#x27;re now discussing um have exotic propulsion systems that from what I&#x27;m learning um most likely eject nutrinos as part of their propulsion process. &gt;&gt; So the Ice Cube nutrino detector would effectively be like an air traffic control tower to observe the flight paths of these vehicles. you know, um, most of our radar systems can&#x27;t track these things because they the I mean it&#x27;s the way the technology functions. It can only track things that go up to a certain speed and then on the screen it&#x27;ll start to look like something&#x27;s skipping across the screen because it&#x27;s only getting a flash of it at different points.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, it gives that weird signature. No human craft can do that. Well, if it goes really fast, it can. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll just look like that. That peculiar thing is exactly how it&#x27;ll look on a radar screen if it&#x27;s just screaming across the sky. You would need another form of observation &gt;&gt; to track our own equipment moving at great speed. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; A standard radar will never function for high-speed human air travel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; You know, this is fascinating to me, and I want to put this to you. is what is the you know the the crisscross between these two events. If you go all the way back to Operation High Jump and Admiral Bird&#x27;s uh expedition there. &gt;&gt; Now he had already been there on a couple of different occasions. This was the big going back with everybody.</p>
<p>You know, it&#x27;s the biggest expedition of all time to Antarctica at the time. &gt;&gt; Um but what he observed were craft when he got there. And we all know the whole thing turned around and got out of there when they were supposed to spend all this time there. No, in fact, you know, it was a much shorter enterprise. And he came back with stories that were in between wars.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re going to be at wars with whatever we saw down there. And there was this whole thing about the discs and everything else. So, he encountered some level of UFO activity. Maybe he was thinking, you know, this is some other group. These are aliens or these are Germans.</p>
<p>And because this is after the war, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s 46 into 47. But the fact that they turn around and that he&#x27;s really uh kept tightly and tight lipped for the rest of his career about this and there are other strange things that happened in relation to high jump to keep the secrecy level. Then flash forward to this detector and what you&#x27;re saying about the air traffic control of UFOs. I want you to put those two together for me because if he was seeing UFOs as a place of origin there down in Antarctica, a base as it were, that spooked them and they thought, you know, we need to get the hell out of here. Um, and this may have been part of the things that they observed down there in the first place, which is why you have people like Lloyd Burkner, who we&#x27;ve talked about extensively, the physicist who went down there with him originally all the way back in 1928.</p>
<p>And then these guys show up later and they are running UFO panels, the Robertson panel and the International Geoysical Year. these things to me when I was listening to your account about this air traffic control of UFOs via this uh experimental exotic technology that started to connect for me. Oh, this is a part of a trend going on decades, you know, now a hundred years of this and this is the culmination that you&#x27;re talking about is they decided this is the point where we can observe them and this is also the point where the stuff that we&#x27;ve redeveloped, this is how we track it. I I see the ice cube um the ice cube array is you know it&#x27;s basically you know phase ray transmitter as well and um as as you know that you know Burkner originally requested monies for research in Antarctica because he said we need to start paying attention to the activities of what&#x27;s moving on and off through the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>I would just say that that in 2011 the best system we had for that came online as Burkner requested. It just it just took this long for us to have this capacity. &gt;&gt; Excellent. Yes, that is an incredible point. And so they&#x27;ve achieved that level and then six years or so after the fact suddenly the intelligence agencies are willing to come out with their version of the UFO file and their people presenting it and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>You and I have seen these people come out. You&#x27;ve seen them up close in Washington and all the rest. And when you did the Steven Greer event, &gt;&gt; um you were exposed to all that. And I will say that I think that that event did sort of put your story more on the radar and I I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s gone out there, but I still don&#x27;t think people realize the impact of what&#x27;s been going on with this aspect of Antarctica and the research that you&#x27;re bringing forward on it. So if you had to kind of um sum it up in this sense &gt;&gt; that thing that you&#x27;re talking about which is is basically like um some version of of harp.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Kind of steroids. Yes. &gt;&gt; So like the Kakona facility which I&#x27;ve gone and visited that area a couple of times like a HARP system um is on a two-dimensional plane.</p>
<p>It has length and width. So it&#x27;s a phased array transmitter with only uh two dimensions. Whereas the ice cube nutrino array also goes down into the earth with great depth. So it has length, width, and depth. It has a third dimension which increases it like like magnitudes.</p>
<p>So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s harp on steroids. &gt;&gt; Incredible. Um, the implications there are dramatic that we finally got something where we could put our own advanced craft into a separate system to track and that Antarctica would be the main station for that. But also, we could be watching the traffic coming to and fro that goes outside of the bounds of the things we&#x27;re aware of. &gt;&gt; Absolutely.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t believe just that there&#x27;s US factions involved. I think I I do not believe the government is the top of the pyramid when it comes to technology. I mean pe people don&#x27;t realize the government doesn&#x27;t manufacture anything. They purchase stuff from manufacturers.</p>
<p>So those manufacturers can certainly like if I want to if I own Lockheed Martin and you own Rathon and and you and I are competing with each other, we are selling our products to other people so that they can war with each other. Um, there&#x27;s no reason for you and I not to maintain better equipment, &gt;&gt; right? If you&#x27;re going to arm other armies, the smartest thing that you could ever do would be to make sure that you can still outgun them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, I believe the corporations technologically have the greatest equipment out there and the military um has crap compared to what these guys have. But now the the corporations have all of the money. I mean, you might have heard, Daniel, that some politicians, you know, um get paid to do what corporations tell them to, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, so I think what we&#x27;re witnessing with the whole disclosure thing right now that everybody&#x27;s barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>Yeah. They&#x27;re trying to get the truth from the government. When the truth is bought and I&#x27;m sorry, the government is bought and paid for by the corporations um to be the the wall to be the gatekeepers. They&#x27;re never they don&#x27;t first and foremost they don&#x27;t have access to the truth. They don&#x27;t have access to the technology.</p>
<p>It is not in the hands of the government. This is one of the things that we got to in the skiffs was the um everything basically reduced down to now that we know that there are rogue factions operating without oversight from the government and therefore we the people what do we do the government already knows it&#x27;s not in control. &gt;&gt; Interesting. Yes. So this fact &gt;&gt; and there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>Like we&#x27;re all we&#x27;re already there. the government is not in control of the uh vast amounts of high technology. So I like the work that like Walter Bosley does and and Joseph Pel. I love when they talk about the breakaway civilization stuff like where that has been going on for a really long time and as of their recent research they&#x27;re pushing this back now into the 1860s. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. With the airship industry there&#x27;s no question about it. um when it&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting to me is the inflection point becomes Antarctica &gt;&gt; because somehow it becomes the center of secret research to a point where I think something like Area 51 is is down the chain. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Because if you are in that obscure location, you are highly undetectable and you&#x27;re also in conditions that are very hard to duplicate if you&#x27;re another country trying to figure out what we&#x27;re doing.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a logistical nightmare for people to try to ease drop on each other over there, so to say. &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Even though technically the Antarctic Treaty affords that all of the signitories um have cart blanch to go check out everybody else&#x27;s facilities to make sure they&#x27;re on the up and up. How come no one does that? Right. &gt;&gt; How come no one does that? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s an extraordinary treaty.</p>
<p>Um, and that whole era of the late 50s for this is extraordinary because Burkner Burkner shows up like this Zelig type figure in the UFO file in Antarctica, meeting with JFK as he&#x27;s about to be assassinated. You know, he&#x27;s on his way to meet Burkner to do this final speech. I had a did a whole documentary on it. &gt;&gt; I watched that. It was fantastic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know what&#x27;s amazing to me about Burkner is he&#x27;s in the heart of this. He was working at the end of his life with James McDonald of course and then he he died very suddenly in the middle of giving a speech to this think tank uh at a relatively early age 62 years old. And I wondered there if this figure who is you know I talk I talk about these factions being exrotect and exshare. It seems to me he was right between the two because he was against sack and against that level of secrecy, but he wasn&#x27;t, you know, he wasn&#x27;t quite coming out to the public.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s quite possible that his speech with Kennedy was going to move the needle dramatically in this direction. Um, when I mentioned the Kennedy piece there around Antarctica, I just want to bring up Bird again and get your reflections on this with your own research around Antarctica. When we find that the person who owned the Texas School Book Depository was Harold Dryhold Bird and that he is the cousin of Admiral Bird and that he owns an experimental aerospace company. Does that and the fact that Kennedy&#x27;s going to meet Burkner with all your knowledge of these secret weapons development and Antarctica and the fact that you&#x27;ve actually been there, how does that strike you? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just it&#x27;s collusion. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like this is why I love the work that you&#x27;re doing because I find it it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s irrefutable.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t say that this stuff means nothing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, to me like the stuff that you&#x27;re putting out there is some of the like the biggest dots connected ever. Um I mean, you know, I I&#x27;m going to shamelessly plug you like I do in a lot of other places. I mean, I tell people all the time cuz like, you know, because of what I do, people often say like, you know, Eric, you throw stones at everyone in disclosure and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re a you&#x27;re a pig because you say everybody&#x27;s a liar and everybody&#x27;s off the track. I go, that&#x27;s not true. I said, I keep telling people to watch Dark Journalists.</p>
<p>I said, this one guy, &gt;&gt; this one guy that&#x27;s putting it together. I said, I throw stones at everyone else cuz they are full of crap. I said, watch Dark Journalist. I said and and and as I do say watch Walter Bosley and Joseph Pel also. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh you guys you guys are like the holy trinity of truth right now. &gt;&gt; Well I&#x27;ll tell you what&#x27;s fascinating and in your work which is I looked at so many different pieces with Antarctica and mostly I had to go far far into the past to get anything that would kind of move the needle on it all. It wasn&#x27;t until you came out and brought the nutrinos and the Christ Church earthquake into view around this that Antarctica, you know, we had all the stranges about John Kerry coming down when he was Secretary of State and he is, you know, just before the Obama administration is out. He&#x27;s down there in Antarctica and they&#x27;re inviting Buzz Aldrin at the same time and you know basically the Pope of Russia, these other people and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a highly auspicious unusual crew, shall we say, and Uldren has to be medically evacuated &gt;&gt; probably for the same reason you were talking about. The conditions there are just so intense.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Um but also having one of the most famous NASA astronauts come down there. &gt;&gt; How does that strike you? It&#x27;s it&#x27;s odd anytime people of any level of importance go there. It seems very weird to me because I mean it&#x27;s the term they say all the times it&#x27;s a harsh effing continent. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s unforgiving and it&#x27;s not like anywhere else in the world where if anything goes wrong anything can be done about it. There&#x27;s not the logistical support that&#x27;s everywhere else on the planet.</p>
<p>Um, to the best of my knowledge, no one&#x27;s ever been rescued from an incident in the middle of Antarctica. You either make it from point A to point B or you&#x27;re done. So, the um the danger that I was in being there is the same danger that these dignitaries expose themselves to. You know, it doesn&#x27;t matter, you know, how many Secret Service agents you have next to you on the flight. If the plane goes down, you all freeze to death, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no extra protection that works against mother nature there.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s you versus mother nature. &gt;&gt; So, they&#x27;re all taking that risk on, which I don&#x27;t understand why these people are taking that risk on. Normally, we protect people like that and buffer them from danger. So, anytime a dignitary went down there, I found it the weirdest thing in the world. Um, in my summer season, I I got mad because there are there are rich people that go down to South Pole and they pay exorbitant amounts of money um to pretend that they skied there.</p>
<p>They lie. They they fly in and they take out their skis and then they go over to the pole and they take their hero shot and they all, you know, tell their friends I skied to the but they&#x27;re lying. Um, and one time I I was coming out of doing my rounds in the emergency power plant and I I opened the door and I looked and there was a child in the hallway, &gt;&gt; one of the kids of one of these rich people. And I I I lost I&#x27;m like, who the hell &gt;&gt; would bring their kid here &gt;&gt; and subject them to this danger? I I wanted to slap the snots out of the parents. Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I was like, &quot;Yeah, you guys are idiots.&quot; &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s Yeah. There&#x27;s That&#x27;s some kind of tourism. My god. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me bring my 8-year-old to South Pole. &gt;&gt; Well, it it is so interesting uh to me when I think about the UFO aspect in relation to this. So, I&#x27;m going to back up and say when you came out at the Greer event, you were talking about all the things you&#x27;d observed there in Antarctica and your research since &gt;&gt; and uh this medical aspect with the Havana syndrome, by the way, is that a legal case at this point? &gt;&gt; Not on not on my part. Um I can&#x27;t get traction or help from anybody. &gt;&gt; I mean, I I I went in good faith to Washington DC.</p>
<p>Spoke to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Nothing happened. I spoke to Arrow. They lied about my testimony when they gave their summary report. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; they they stated they stated in their summary report that um they got reports of victims of Havana syndrome from every continent except for Antarctica.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I almost fell out of my chair. &gt;&gt; You were like, I put that on the record already. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s exactly what I went there to accomplish. &gt;&gt; And they said that no one reported that. What an incredible whitewash of an institution.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s incredible. &gt;&gt; And they&#x27;re obviously holding up that wall of secrecy. &gt;&gt; Um, when you think about the UFO file, secret space program, these covert space activities in relation to some of the research and experience you had down there. What do you see happening in relation to I think that you suggested at a certain point they were using this exotic technology for communications purposes in deep space. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s where you just were sending my brain.</p>
<p>I was hoping you were going to bring that up. Yeah. I &gt;&gt; again um back to the um the research that Bosley and Fel are doing. um they&#x27;re pushing back the timeline for airship activities on world and then it begs the question at what point was it off world? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And how far could they go? Obviously um if we start sending people outward we&#x27;re going to need a means of communication.</p>
<p>Mhm. &gt;&gt; And I do also believe that in the the the transmit mode, a phased array transmitter which is at the South Pole station um could function in this is you know highlevel tech of quantum entangled faster than light communication so that if there is a fleet out there which you know like Gary McKinnon had you know broken into the NASA files and said you know this is a list of off-world ships and this is the list of the captains. Okay. Then we&#x27;re going to have to be able personnel. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. We&#x27;re going to have to be able to communicate with those people, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I mean, we put submarines in the ocean and we have um very highlevel technology to be able to communicate with underway submarines in secret. &gt;&gt; So, you know, if there is in fact an off-world fleet, obviously we&#x27;re going to need comms. &gt;&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic um and very black project for developing this. It&#x27;s probably been under development since about 1928. If you think about the radio setup of Radio America and all the things that took place there. Um by now, this is a very important piece of it because when you get to 1972 and they cut off any kind of moon uh manned moon missions, there&#x27;s no explanation for it. And when they go to say, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re coming back.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re doing the Artemis program, you know, it&#x27;s like what happened 52 years in between. &gt;&gt; So all of that infrastructure has been developed. Something&#x27;s been going on. Something&#x27;s been developed in that period. &gt;&gt; Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And this, I think, gets to the heart of it. &gt;&gt; I couldn&#x27;t argue with that logic and reasoning. It&#x27;s just um I think things just went dark. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s all.</p>
<p>They just put it behind the veil of secrecy and and and gave us the shenanigans. I mean, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s really no reason that we couldn&#x27;t have continued the the the what was presented as the standard operation for moon travel. Um, you know, of course, we lost the blueprints, we lost the videos, we lo, you know, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s all um it&#x27;s all shenanigans in my book. I mean, I didn&#x27;t even believe that as a kid. I didn&#x27;t even understand how can we not be going back to the moon.</p>
<p>Um and and even now, you know, as an adult and doing research, I&#x27;ve learned that, you know, the shuttle program that we were all enamored with as children, um I came across stuff that said that you like when they when NASA was first trying to get funded um for the shuttle program for the funding they were requesting, they were claiming there was going to be two shuttle launches a week. Wow. How&#x27;d that work out for the return on investment? &gt;&gt; Incredible. Wow. I think it&#x27;s interesting um and we have from astronauts like the late Gordon Cooper that the Mars mission was all set and that was it was set in 1966 and then again set for 1981.</p>
<p>He heard about both missions. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. &gt;&gt; One of them he was supposed to lead but the training that took place was supposed to have taken place in Antarctica. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting too. &gt;&gt; Somehow the conditions there are, you know, to open them up to what space life would be like and also what living on another planet would be like.</p>
<p>Um there&#x27;s a a piece back there, a book called Two Planets, which was a great inspiration to guys like Von Braonn who went on to after serving the Hitler uh V2 rockets up went on to lead our our NASA program. My question is and and this guy Lisswitz is is quite fascinating because what he puts across is that this Martian civilization come here and the place that they go to are the North Pole and the South Pole. &gt;&gt; Those are the conditions and it&#x27;s very interesting. It seems like somebody who&#x27;s dimed in to a level of information and this was written in 1898. &gt;&gt; Oh jeez.</p>
<p>Um, so yeah, we&#x27;re we&#x27;re it&#x27;s almost like that arc once you get to it and once you get the real rocket pioneers, there&#x27;s some crisscross with Antarctica that shows up and then the Nazi fascination with Antarctica and the fact that they got Bird to advise them uh and you know before we were at war of course and um he gave them all this advice and they said we want to go down there for whaling purposes. Uh but we know there was a plan in there about developing new Schwaban land. My question is the Antarctica is the focus of all this secret activity. &gt;&gt; And um if you look at it in terms of the coverage that we get on it on the alternative side with the independent media, it doesn&#x27;t go very deep, does it? &gt;&gt; No, not at all. I would I would equate it again to back to my experience with submarines is that it&#x27;s such a controlled topic.</p>
<p>Right? &gt;&gt; Anything that you see in the media about United States submarines is curated by the submarine service, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Nothing out in the public that they didn&#x27;t approve. Like that&#x27;s, you know, it&#x27;s so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like that with Antarctica, I believe. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Which is why I I I came out from the angle that I came out with was like, you know, if there&#x27;s other rogue factions, I&#x27;m a rogue faction. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m fighting those rogue factions.</p>
<p>All the rogue factions are fighting each other. and I represent the rogue faction of the negatively impacted crew of South Pole Station. &gt;&gt; Interesting. Uh and th those factions in there. Yeah.</p>
<p>Because we have to remember you&#x27;re dealing with human lives in &gt;&gt; those types of extreme environments and the amount of things that they&#x27;ve covered up. I mean, you still have the gigantic cover up of high jump and the files are still sealed, you know, some 80 years later. would tells us a great deal. I believe it&#x27;s a hint there. Uh there&#x27;s the fascinating story about Bird&#x27;s son in the 1980s gets invited by this think tank uh in Washington DC and he lived right in Boston here on Beacon Street and he takes this train and disappears.</p>
<p>Shows up a month later dead in a warehouse and he was going to give the first exposition on high jump because he was there. He went with his dad. &gt;&gt; I didn&#x27;t know he went with him. &gt;&gt; He did. He was 22 years old and he was there.</p>
<p>He was part of the crew. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; that means nothing again, Daniel. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a big &gt;&gt; Yeah. You go to talk about it, you know, end up in different clothing in a warehouse somewhere, you know. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s wild.</p>
<p>Yeah. See, I mean I mean obviously Bird is is a big part of this. Burkner is a big part of this. Um, I have I have no doubt in my mind that, you know, whatever Kennedy and Burkner were going to discuss on the day that he was prevented from talking to Burkner publicly, um, that it was going to be very Antarctic related. &gt;&gt; It just it makes too much sense.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Yeah, it had to have been Antarctic related. And it&#x27;s very interesting because Burkner his strong Antarctica association having been there one of the first guys there with Bird in 1928. I mean, that&#x27;s as early uh on this as you get. And then the fact that we have Kennedy, you know, being assassinated by the, you know, of course, in reality, the pathy Oswald being in the building owned by another huge bird connected &gt;&gt; piece, which is dryird. It&#x27;s just it&#x27;s an astounding move of history right there.</p>
<p>And I think we&#x27;re still left in that mystery limbo. The question that I want to get to with you is one of the things that you started to investigate when you left Antarctica had to do with using this type of technology or say a mind control or mind influence purpose. I remember having Nick Beg on the show on a on a number of occasions and him talking to me about HARP and I&#x27;m sure he got so many questions about HARP during his career for writing this fantastic uh book about it. But one of the things in the patent originally was about altering the moods of populations. &gt;&gt; Uh that&#x27;s in the patent apparently and it is based on techn uh Tesla technology after all.</p>
<p>What did you discover in relation to that? And you seem to kind of dial into a particular idea of this voice to skull type technology and did you experience that by the way? &gt;&gt; You know something? Well, let me let me just go linear with the questions that you asked. Um, I would say that um, Beckage&#x27;s information was very influential because once I started to realize that these were, you know, different iterations of Tesla technology and that the South Pole technology was just magnitudes more powerful uh, in capability than what HARP can do. I just started, well, if HARP can do these things, then that should mean that the South Pole technology should be able to do those things and more and with greater ease and efficiency. So to me, it just it just moved things from one column to the other. &gt;&gt; And then in regards to, you know, have I experienced these things, I would say, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>I I refer to them as intrusive thoughts. Um, and this is I know that you&#x27;re also a fan of um, you know, studying the mystery schools and antiquity and I am a firm believer that what we are seeing contemporarily are what I would say are bastardized technologies um, that are replicating ancient techniques. &gt;&gt; Interesting. &gt;&gt; Back in the day, you know, you can be in the mystery schools and they all had, you know, they all operated under the banner of know thyself. That&#x27;s really important.</p>
<p>Right? Because if you don&#x27;t know these technologies exist, you don&#x27;t know that the intrusive thought can be applied. Well, we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t need the technology to accomplish that mission. There were people back in the day that could throw their voice. &gt;&gt; There were people that could mimic a voice. Those were techniques, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What if you didn&#x27;t know that technique existed, [Music] &gt;&gt; right? Imagine the power somebody can wield over you, Daniel, if they walked into the room and could throw their voice right into your head, so to say, &gt;&gt; in your voice, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That would be the application of an intrusive thought by technique.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s been around for eons. So, um, &gt;&gt; yeah, that&#x27;s ancient adepts would teach their students to know thyself. So now the the interesting thing would be like well if I tr if I had that skill set if I was a master of those skills and I tried to apply this to you the problem that I would have is if I don&#x27;t know you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I have no intel on you um I can start trying to apply intrusive thoughts but you know yourself right like let&#x27;s just say um for all I know you you don&#x27;t eat meat you&#x27;re a vegetarian but if I come in and I start trying to manipulate you and I&#x27;m like, hey, why don&#x27;t you go over to the banquet table and grab yourself a burger and I do it in your voice. You would be thinking to yourself like, why am I why am I thinking I want a burger right now? &gt;&gt; It wouldn&#x27;t make sense. And you would be a student and you&#x27;d be like, ah, there&#x27;s somebody there&#x27;s a wizard in the room trying to manipulate me and I know that I don&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>So, if you know yourself, you can divine out the intrusive thoughts from your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yes. So in the modern world that issue still exists. You can&#x27;t apply the intrusive thoughts to a target that you don&#x27;t have um let&#x27;s say meta data on &gt;&gt; right. Yes.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s that collection of information &gt;&gt; intel on the target to be able to apply intrusive thoughts without the receiver um noticing that they don&#x27;t match the rest of their thoughts. So when you ask me have I had intrusive thoughts I would say yes because they haven&#x27;t done enough research on me. They they don&#x27;t have enough metadata. I&#x27;m not as involved with social media. I pay cash for things so that all of my transactions aren&#x27;t observed and then metadata gathered.</p>
<p>So yes, there are there are times where all of a sudden a thought pops in my head and I&#x27;m like, you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s not me. You know, I I laugh at this, but I want to ask you, do you feel uh especially since you brought so much of this out about the secrecy in Antarctica and the time you spent there, I mean, have you felt uh targeted at any time as a result of your research? &gt;&gt; Oh, constantly. &gt;&gt; Constantly. &gt;&gt; Constantly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, in so many ways. Um I&#x27;ve been physically threatened more times than I can count. I was physically assaulted in Washington DC. There was other whistleblowers, DC Long, uh, uh, Steven Dignner, Michael Herrera.</p>
<p>They witnessed the tail end of the event. It was, it was an altercation. It was, you know, it happens. Um, I&#x27;ve had family members, um, threatened. Um, I&#x27;m I mean, I&#x27;m constantly harassed online by every type of troll under under the sun.</p>
<p>Um, people all the time, you know, I&#x27;ve had people say, &quot;If you show up to an event, I&#x27;m gonna knock you out.&quot; And I say, &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get there. Good luck.&quot; you know, um it is. Yeah. I mean, it is what it is. My mindset is um you never give in to bullies no matter what.</p>
<p>I mean, the world suffers from deviating from that norm. Now, it&#x27;s you know, oh, if you know, somebody says something bad to you, you know, you know, turn your cheek, walk away. But no, you punched a guy in the face. you know, just there&#x27;s no reason if if we choose to yield to bullyism, they always win. Like it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s there&#x27;s no other way around it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Interesting. Uh and they create an environment where you feel like, well, it&#x27;s such a hassle. I I can&#x27;t even share this story. And the idea is to discourage you on a very deep level. Um, but it&#x27;s interesting to me that you would encounter that because I feel like there are a lot of people who tell stories and things about Antarctica and they don&#x27;t go through anything like that because it doesn&#x27;t threaten this essential order of secrecy that&#x27;s gone down there and that true part of the &gt;&gt; propaganda.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not true. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That&#x27;s part of the propaganda to to um dissuade people from the actual truth. Um, you know, I I&#x27;ll be completely honest.</p>
<p>I mean, I I respect that Linda Molten Howal probably had a wonderful career of research back in the day, but the angle that she&#x27;s firing from now on her Antarctica stuff, I mean, her Dr. Michael Solid, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re simply getting bamboozled. I&#x27;ve spoken with both of those people. And to be completely honest, Daniel, right, like um who&#x27;s going to be the better party to vet someone having been to Antarctica or not? Me or Linda Molton? How? How would she know? So I think she&#x27;s just being bamboozled by people that are claiming to have gone down there and she doesn&#x27;t know any better. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is very interesting and I feel very strongly about this with the Luna task force committee as well at Congress.</p>
<p>You know, they don&#x27;t have any of the right people around the UFO thing. They have George Knap telling stories from the &#x27;9s and there, you know, that&#x27;s great, but it doesn&#x27;t move the needle at all. And then you have these guys, of course, they&#x27;ve run everything from Grush to Chris Melon&#x27;s uh threat program, the UFO threat program that Melon, the DoD billionaire and cousin of John Warner. Uh and Warner&#x27;s exposed a lot of his program. Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;ve had all kinds of dustups with with Melon. But what&#x27;s interesting to me is that the people that they choose to focus on and the narratives they choose to focus on have nothing to do when you have guys like Eric Berles. And I say this, you know, wanting to hope that people like Berles, Burchchett, and Luna would go and take this task force and do something remarkable with it before their time is up, uh, of doing it. Instead, they&#x27;re playing this incredibly low-level game with the UFO file, and they&#x27;re keeping it at a very superficial entertainment level when they could go very deep. If they brought you in tomorrow and they said, &quot;Here&#x27;s the UFO file dealing with Antarctica and if they brought the information that we&#x27;ve put forward about Burkner and others and made that the interface between the JFK research that they are doing, they&#x27;re letting these things out.</p>
<p>Well, here&#x27;s this declassified document, but they&#x27;re doing it in a vacuum.&quot; And so if you don&#x27;t crisscross those two things in that sense, the secrecy around let&#x27;s say a 60-year-old assassination and the the secrecy around 80 years of the UFO file and then the development into Antarctica, that would be exciting. You could blow the entire case wide open and um so this is my problem with it. when you look at it and you know just remove my opinion completely. What do you think about what they&#x27;ve presented in terms of whistleblowers and others and uh you know you mentioned some people there uh who have tried to go on the record in earnest but for the majority of them you know how do you feel about them? I I see it from top to bottom now. And this is this is from my experience, my opinion.</p>
<p>Having, you know, lived the life, gone gone through the process of attempting to be a good faith whistleblower and observing what these folks did with the information, I am of the opinion this is a completely contrived circus from top to bottom. Everybody is a willing participating actor. We the people are suffering stage craft. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a conj job. &gt;&gt; Again, what I was saying earlier about the government, so you&#x27;re talking about government officials working with it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a show.</p>
<p>Warner put it perfectly. It&#x27;s a thousand ring circus &gt;&gt; and they just spot they just shine the next light on the next ring and then they set the st. Oh, and now we got another whistleblower over here. Oh, and now we have a new government official that&#x27;s gonna throw their hat in the ring and they&#x27;re here to help us get the truth to you. It&#x27;s an act.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s an act. They They have no intention of getting the truth out there. It is their job to blockade said truth from ever getting to the people. The corporations have the truth. The government does not.</p>
<p>People are barking up the wrong tree. knocking on the wrong doors and being pied pipered away while their um good intentioned energies of we the people are being dissipated by very good counterintelligence agents. I mean you&#x27;ve I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard of Jake Barber. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>So he&#x27;s been put out on display now as as a whistleblower and a good guy. Jake Barbara stated publicly on the Jesse Michaels show that when he went to Washington DC in June of 23, he went there to gather information on whistleblowers. I was one of them. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And it was to help facilitate the FBI with arrests.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. See, this is so important. &gt;&gt; And now he&#x27;s now now he&#x27;s paraded around as the good guy. But what my experience was was that they they they threw a net. They brought in whistleblowers like myself.</p>
<p>They gathered information from us. Then they&#x27;ve repackaged it, redistributed it to their actors. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; To pretend it&#x27;s their info. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>Right. And they&#x27;re using the same talking points, &gt;&gt; you know, to kind of put in that little dose of authenticity and they&#x27;re surrounding it with a completely disinformation narrative. That&#x27;s what you see going on in the entire uh UFO file, the UFO disclosure field. that whole UAP wave uh coming out of TTSA and Alzando and all the rest of it which has been shown over and over again to be uh manipulated &gt;&gt; but and yet people go back to it again and again. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is it&#x27;s very frustrating.</p>
<p>I recently um came across um a document that was leaked on X and it was um apparently an exchange between John Estridge and someone who in this document calls himself Shawn Weaver, who I have every reason to believe is Jake Barber, &gt;&gt; just operating under false pretenses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and with that being said, the the document discusses this person&#x27;s engagement well before June of 23. So I took this document as proof that that Barber&#x27;s lying saying that you know he initially when he when he came public he was saying that you know he wasn&#x27;t involved in disclosure and was a participant in the program willingly um until the you know the testimony of Michael Herrera. Um, but I honestly don&#x27;t see anything in I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, Herrera&#x27;s experience is Herrera&#x27;s experience, but there was nothing from Herrera&#x27;s testimony that I found so compelling that would get a man that had been acquiescing his whole life, his whole career.</p>
<p>There was nothing in Herrera&#x27;s testimony that would have compelled Barbara to be like, you know what, I&#x27;ve been on the wrong team for all these years. &gt;&gt; He had a great come to Jesus moment with that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, there there wasn&#x27;t anything, you know, special there to compel um the the black team agents to switch sides, &gt;&gt; right? So I think what we what we witnessed was that Barbara went there as a faction for the corporations &gt;&gt; to try to get their hooks into people and convert them &gt;&gt; towards an operation that would sidstep and and dissipate the energies of good intentional whistleblowers. Those folks tried to get their hooks into me at that event and I refused because yes, I am I&#x27;m um few and far between.</p>
<p>Well, I I fall to the lovebombing and and desires of collaboration from these factions. It&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen it too many times now. I played a very patient game um that every time somebody jumps up and is like, &quot;You&#x27;re doing the right thing and I want to help you.&quot; I go, &quot;Just just go away.&quot; &gt;&gt; Actions try to get at you. They want to come up and be buddy buddy with you. We see Lou Alzando doing this all over the place and people suck it up because they want to be buddy buddy with with Lou the freaking torture.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, how could you go to a guy like that for the truth around the UFO file which is so heavily &gt;&gt; uh you know covered over by the secrecy the intelligence agencies. And it&#x27;s interesting because when they start to choose other whistleblowers, they choose them from institutions that are honeycombed with CIA players.</p>
<p>So when you get the NGA people, the NSA people, and the NRO people, they&#x27;re all trained by the same CIA people. So it comes back to that central thing. And their job is to create this story around the UFO file. &gt;&gt; And I they they obviously figured out we can&#x27;t keep this thing bottled up. What we&#x27;ll do is we&#x27;ll make a threat story.</p>
<p>Mhm. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That&#x27;s &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s par for the course. They don&#x27;t want to discuss that &gt;&gt; 99% of the stuff that we see in the sky is ours.</p>
<p>They certainly don&#x27;t want that getting out there. So the the cover story currently is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s them. It&#x27;s the aliens. Oh, and they&#x27;re a threat. So, by the way, we&#x27;re going to need more checks cut so that you know we can get rid of that threat, &gt;&gt; right? you know, since since we don&#x27;t have that tech, we&#x27;re going to have to invest in it.</p>
<p>So, like this to me, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like 9/11 all over again. Like, you know, uh September 10th, we get the DoD telling us, &quot;Oh, we lost $2.3 trillion. Sorry about that.&quot; Um and then on 911, it&#x27;s like, &quot;Oh, son of a gun. We going to need you guys to start cutting checks again. We have a big dilemma.&quot; &gt;&gt; Uh it&#x27;s incredible discrepancies.</p>
<p>And of course we know now it goes much further up the chain in terms of the amount of money that&#x27;s missing. Uh when you think about the secret development and I&#x27;m going to kind of wind our conversation all around to this which is you&#x27;ve been in the middle of that secrecy and the after effects of it. When you look at Antarctica and you look at the enigma of the UFO file heavily shrouded in secrecy on on both sides. Um, what is the crisscross? What is the factor that draws them both together? That is, give me the combination of the UFO file in Antarctica. &gt;&gt; I I think it has a lot to do with there&#x27;s been more high tech going on for a lot longer than we can really comprehend.</p>
<p>So, like, you know, when when Ben Rich said, you know, anything that you can think of, you know, we&#x27;ve already done it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I think &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think we already did it way before he ever said that. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; To the tune of like what Fel and Bosley are getting at, you know, that back in the 1860s this was being looked at. I mean, I&#x27;m doing research about the greater Long Island area, the Germans there, the the aerospace engineering corporations. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m pushing for a case at this point.</p>
<p>Can&#x27;t prove it yet. Um I really believe that the whole um Wright Brothers North Carolina event was contrived to draw people off what was already going on in the greater Long Island area. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Oh, there&#x27;s no question because everybody knows that North Carolina that you know they they coined the term first in flight.</p>
<p>Well, Long Island is referred to as the cradle of aviation. So, &gt;&gt; interesting. Yeah. And &gt;&gt; it happened almost immediately. We went from, you know, bicycle mechanics whipping some pipes and cloth together in North Carolina and then almost overnight there&#x27;s a fully functioning aerospace industry all over Long Island cranking out every kind of plane you can imagine and and tons of sea planes, experimental plane.</p>
<p>It just in the blink of an eye. &gt;&gt; It is fascinating. And of course, the Cosmos Club is around this and the Wright brothers were housed at the Cosmos Club while all this was taking place. And the Cosmos Club again is that interface when you get around the Delsha material, the airship material and this whole piece. A lot of the people who are associated with this cosmos club uh like Tilman and others are the ones who are seen in relation you know landing the ships and things and identifying themselves saying hi I&#x27;m SC Tman you know um so there&#x27;s an incredible thing you&#x27;re raising there which is it&#x27;s a much older I have to ask you since it&#x27;s Long Island has Montalk showed up in your research at all? Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; absolututely. There&#x27;s a lot to be said for that. Um, the Sage Radar system that was out there was a a savage system. It held the record for being like one of the longest military systems to exist without something um coming in to um be better than it. It ran for like 60 years or something before they came up with a system that was able to replace it cuz it it was so ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Um, one of the one of what most fascinating facts I think about Montalk Point, um, the first thing that, um, George Washington did as president was go out to Montalk Point and commission the Montalk lighthouse. &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. That tells you a great deal. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, step one is, you know, we need a lighthouse right here, you know, and it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s easy to get out there at the time. There&#x27;s I mean there&#x27;s a lot of reports from back in the day of German submarines entering um uh into what was you know submerged access points in the Montalk area. So again the connection between Germans Long Island and high technology seems to be going on for a lot longer than most people have even begun to delve. &gt;&gt; That is fascinating. Um, and when you think about something like Brook Haven and you think about the particle acceleration, we have the whole CERN problem over in Switzerland, but it started here &gt;&gt; and you the particle acceleration and the particle beam weapon aspect.</p>
<p>That takes me right back into what you were describing about Antarctica and um the you know these beams and we&#x27;ve had these stories recently about these beams being fired off from Antarctica towards the direction of Australia and I don&#x27;t know how authentic those reports are by the way and yet it seems to fit this pattern of demonstration experiment uh that you were talking about and in the case of Christ church New Zealand event. Somehow, you know, either it got out of hand or it was intended to create the disruption that it did as a test of this weapon. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m sure that you&#x27;ve probably heard that Nicola Tesla has said that there are certain places on this planet that are better for experimenting with energy than other places. &gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. &gt;&gt; Nicola Tesla tapped the Warden Cliff location on Long Island as being one of those positions, &gt;&gt; right? Of course.</p>
<p>Yes. Nobody seems to have ever argued with that reality. They&#x27;ve only enforced it because Brook Haven National Labs is right across the street from where Warden Cliff was. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The Shorum nuclear power plant is 2 minutes up the road from where Warden Cliff was. Camp Sigfrieded, the German American bone stronghold after World War II was right there. Also incredible. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s tons of pictures of Nazis in full regalia marching through the streets. That is this energy study area.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Back to the the the the Nassau County area of Long Island and and what I&#x27;ve been looking into the German heritage and the original settlers. um literally right in the community where I grew up, I remember seeing this sign. And when I went back with um a friend of mine, James Olivo, who&#x27;s a researcher from New York that I got engaged with, um I was showing him some of the sites and some of the things that I knew about Long Island, and I brought him to this spot where there&#x27;s an old German church and graveyard, and there&#x27;s a sign there referencing the, you know, the original settlers. And when the first Germans settled this particular area, they referred to it as the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I mean, a lot of people can sit here and say, &quot;Well, that doesn&#x27;t really mean anything.&quot; But you&#x27;re someone that studies these things. It may not mean anything to us today, but I assure you that back in the day, they didn&#x27;t just decide to call it the New Jerusalem lightly, &gt;&gt; right? Well, and think about new Schwab and land, of course, this, you know, Valhalla or the German Nazis going down there and using bird&#x27;s information and guidance to be like, hey, you know, we need all this from you. Uh, Eric, absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>I have a second planned show with you if you&#x27;re up for it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Uh, after we after this one, so we&#x27;ll schedule that because we need to have you back on. We&#x27;ve covered so much here, but I want to go deeper and even open up the subject. you&#x27;ve gone very deep on this today.</p>
<p>Uh, extraordinary research. How can people help you get behind your research and where can they find you? &gt;&gt; Uh, the best place would be to go to my website. I&#x27;m trying to get outside of all these censorship platforms and social media things. I I have a website uh deciphering.tv. Uh, it&#x27;s been out for a couple of years and I&#x27;m actually going to be bringing on some more excellent researchers and content creators um because I&#x27;m I&#x27;m sick and tired of the debacle that we see out there and I do really believe um that we the people, you know, um can work together um many hands makes light work and a rising tide raises all ships.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;ve been working hard to find diamonds in the rough and I&#x27;m going to grow this platform and um try to do the best that I can to, you know, work with, you know, geniuses like you and Farel and and Bosley that are doing real research and finding actionable intelligence instead of all this um speculative stage craft that we&#x27;re suffering. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, people can go to my website and, you know, share stuff. There&#x27;s an archive section where I have documentation. um people can peruse it, download it. Um but that would be the that would be uh really appreciated from the audience.</p>
<p>Um I&#x27;m also on X which I&#x27;m very easy to find there. So if they want to, you know, engage me there is is sometimes easier for folks and I do some X spaces and things like that. And um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m pretty easy to get a hold of for anybody out there that has, you know, dots to connect and and you know, wants interviews. So people can find me. &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s fantastic.</p>
<p>the um if I were to say here to the Luna committee and the task force people that you&#x27;d be willing to testify before that committee, would you be able to uh say that that&#x27;s true? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m actively I guess you would say uh courting or being courted by um politicians, but I again this is part of my experience is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m learning it doesn&#x27;t bear fruit. So like in one breath I would like Daniel absolutely. Um, I would I would go and and testify again. If you said, &quot;Eric, do you think anything will become of it?&quot; I&#x27;d say, &quot;No, &gt;&gt; right.&quot; Well, you have &gt;&gt; I would say I would say to you, sir, I would say, &quot;Sir, watch and learn what happens.</p>
<p>I will go testify again and you tell me if it was worth my effort.&quot; &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. And yet I think you could smash open the congressional hearings in that task force environment which is so controlled and so you know heavily uh kind of based towards the lack of knowledge on the part of Luna and Burchett regardless of their intentions is astonishing around the UFO file and you&#x27;re getting this fluff on top and you&#x27;re getting the kind of Alzando grush and all the rest of that. I think that, you know, they they should have a challenge online publicly here that you will speak before them publicly in that committee about these issues. And I think that that would be a fantastic thing.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to see it happen. &gt;&gt; I would I would I would love to engage this in any arena. I the way that I&#x27;ve been saying this is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m a champion for the truth. I&#x27;m I&#x27;m engaged in the battle for disclosure. This is a war.</p>
<p>Like Alex Jones says, info wars. Like this is this is very legitimate. I champion my crew from the South Pole station. I champion we the people of this planet because these technologies we are actively suffering under it. There is a war going on.</p>
<p>The factions are fighting to be king of the mountain. Um the governments have no control over it and we the people are caught in the crossfire and there&#x27;s walking wounded everywhere. &gt;&gt; Wow. That is fascinating. And uh well it&#x27;s your uh research and your experience that is shaking up uh the whole conversation around directed energy weapons in Antarctica and this inevitably draws us into the UFO file.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s where I want uh people to go for this. I look forward to more with you and we&#x27;ll do a program with you. I have something special in mind. So I&#x27;ll get in touch with you and uh we&#x27;ll put that together. It&#x27;s fantastic uh to talk with you and of course we need to get our our pal John Warner back on the scene as well.</p>
<p>uh because he&#x27;s such an excellent and important voice in all this. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yeah, I love chatting with John. That would that would be a great conversation for sure. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Okay, Eric, we&#x27;ll talk soon and uh of course this will come right out. It&#x27;s fantastic to have you here and more to come. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you so much, Daniel. Have an excellent day and I I appreciate um the fight that you&#x27;re doing as well.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, that&#x27;s great. Talk to you soon. &gt;&gt; Have a great day, sir. [Music] Heat. Heat.</p>
<p>[Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] I think [Music]</p>
