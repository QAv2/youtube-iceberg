            <p>hello everyone out there um welcome to my channel and uh this is an educational Channel we look at different varieties of theories of everything and eventually hopefully we&#x27;ll get to the point where we can even kind of synthesize all the different ones and figure out uh that they&#x27;re all saying the same thing but uh using different uh nomenclatures different languages and um today is the 318th video that we have done on the reciprocal system of theory from Mr dwey Bernard Larson and Mr Larsson uh was born in 1898 and he was a World War I vet and he uh then came back and uh he was born in North Dakota moved out to uh Oregon and uh began a career there as an engineer eventually and uh was dabbling with some different scientific problems he was trying to make a little bit of a contribution to his field uh but he stumbled across something that was much more profound than what he bargained for but he answered the call and he developed uh his ideas um you know to the to the uh degree that you know they deserved uh not just a small contribution but a a a Monumental uh Revolution and uh he eventually after many many years of working it out he put out his two fundamental postulates in the late 1950s and the first of those postulates is uh by far the more important and it basically says that we live in a universe that is composed entirely of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are more or less reciprocals of one another uh they have the same qualities and um they do not exist independently only together in motion and uh they both have their coordinate aspects meaning they come in three dimensions and they both have their clock aspects meaning that they progress uh in a scalar manner meaning that it they progress in no particular direction um so in time that looks like a clock um the clock is always getting later and later and later and later and in space that looks like um uh looks like a balloon with dots on it that is expanding all the dots are moving farther and farther and farther apart space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart a clock space and then space and time also come only in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time and above below that uh you do not have uh either of those qualities um you have to have a full unit before you have anything and if you have exactly one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light which is what Larson called unit speed and so in the reciprocal system a universe of motion a universe made entirely of motion motion is the fundamental qu quantity and so motion is the first thing that exists so you have motion this unit speed before you have anything that is moving you have to be able to kind of grock that in your head you&#x27;ve got you have motion before anything that would be moving that that kind of goes against the way that we&#x27;re accustomed to thinking um and one of Larson&#x27;s uh followers uh kind of put it that you know uh for 3,000 years we have seen uh space and time as really like the container of the universe the action the drama of the universe occurs in this on this stage uh in this container of space time but but in larsson&#x27;s system SpaceTime is actually the contents of the universe not just the container of the universe it&#x27;s not only the container but it is it is all the things that are participating in the drama uh you know not only is the motion motion but the thing is also motion and so um you know it requires kind of a about face in our thinking about things and so it&#x27;s a little difficult to grasp because of there&#x27;s so many kind of unfamiliar Concepts but when you get used to larsson&#x27;s Theory you can see how it&#x27;s very very self-consistent he follows the same rules for everything but um you know those rules seem rather arbitrary when seen in a vacuum when you see only you know him applying it in one area it&#x27;s like where&#x27;d he get that from but then you see him applying it in another area you know he&#x27;s applying the same principles to Atomic physics as he&#x27;s applying to uh you know stars and galaxies and so you can see how the system is self-consistent but only once you&#x27;ve been exposed enough to it okay now um when you know when you have that speed of light background um that really means that you have half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light um which goes against Einstein&#x27;s dictum that said the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and nothing moves faster than the speed of light Einstein is only referring to the half of the universe that Larson calls the material sector but the half that&#x27;s called The Cosmic sector is kind of uh ignored uh by um Legacy science um the good news is that the cosmic sector and the material sector are identical uh in general except that they are reciprocals of each other so all you have to do to figure out what&#x27;s going on in the cosmic sector is to invert the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space threedimensional of space and clock time the clock is always progressing getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have three dimensions of space I mean I&#x27;m sorry three dimensions of time coordinate time and you have clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart um so that is kind of the relationships between those two sectors um now what we&#x27;re looking at today is today is the second installment of of reading uh an article from Larson and uh this article is called reference systems and again so the reference system that he&#x27;s referring to uh that the Universe actually conforms to is this uh outward at the speed of light in all directions he calls that the progression of the natural reference system he refers to it as the natural reference system the reference system that um the universe actually conforms to that is not to be confused with the absolute reference system which Larson says does not exist there is no absolute reference system your reference system is based upon what you choose in the uh Legacy science the absolute reference system is utter Stillness uh um you know it is um from zero you measure you measure all your motions from zero in the reciprocal system with a natural reference system you&#x27;re measuring things from the speed of light okay so that is um that&#x27;s some of what he talked about here in the first installment so now we&#x27;re going to uh look at uh today&#x27;s installment uh so if you want to go back and start this paper at the beginning you want to watch yesterday&#x27;s video video okay um the concept of an expanding system of reference is applicable only to scalar motion again scalar motion is a motion with a magnitude but no Direction no specific Direction just like spots on an expanding balloon all of them are moving away from each other okay it is unfamiliar uh the expanding system of reference is unfamiliar because the existence of inherently scalar motion was not recognized prior to the development of the reciprocal system not withstanding the fact that motions such as those of spots on an expanding balloon are obviously different in kind from ordinary vectorial motions a reference system uh just to go back a vectorial motion is a motion that has a direction a vector is like an arrow it there is a direction of a vectorial motion so the scalar motion of the expanding balloon is different in kind from ordinary vectorial motion a reference system for scalar Motion in a three-dimensional Universe necessarily takes the form of a sphere as the imputed direction of a scalar Motion in such a universe is determined by chance an object which has moved a scalar distance from its point of origin during the uh during a certain interval will be found somewhere on the surface of a sphere of radius D for the purpose of explaining the relation of such a reference system to the more familiar types let us assume an object a to be motionless a sphere centered at a then constitutes a stationary system of reference magnitudes in which uh which can of course be expressed either in polar or rectangular coordinates a sphere centered at object B which is not not moving relative to a is part of the same reference system a sphere centered at object C which is in motion relative to a is another reference system of the same kind however if the sphere centered at a is assumed uh uh the word is assured but I&#x27;m not sure which he means assumed or assured if the sphere centered at a is assumed to be expanding at rate X this constitutes a reference system of a different kind a moving system in the special case where the rate of expansion X is Unity one unit of space per one unit of time we have the natural Moving System the reference system to which the basic units of the universe actually conform if an expanding sphere of this kind is centered at object b instead of object a it is another part of the natural system however both A and B can occupy positions in the same stationary reference system only if they are moving inward gravitationally for all practi practical purposes therefore it can be considered that a separate system of reference is centered at B it is true that all points in reference system B are moving outward from a but this outward mode motion is counterbalanced by the inward gravitational motion of equal magnitude so that the only effective ratio of photons emitted from B is the motion outward from so that the only effective motion of photons emitted from B is the motion outward from B generalizing the principle brought out in the forgoing paragraphs we may say that scalar motion can be represented in a stationary three-dimensional system of reference only if reference points are defined you know so you&#x27;re basically defining a reference point by saying that this point Point here is motionless this is the point that&#x27;s motionless um that&#x27;s how you you put a scaler motion into a reference system the limitation on our ability to represent Motion in a fixed coordinate system may be annoying but if we want to understand the physical Universe we will have to take it as it is we cannot force it to conform to what we think it ought to be or what we find Convenient the discovery that the physical Universe transcends the limitations of our usual reference systems is one of the most significant of the results that have been obtained from the development of the reciprocal system of theory it is now clear that this Universal cannot be forced this universe cannot be forced into the mold that pre previous physical theories have prepared for it there is no valid reason why physical actions must be limited to those events and those phenomena that can be represented in the reference systems that the human race is capable of constructing and the finding of the reciprocal system is that it is not so limited the inability to deal with scalar motion on the same basis as vectorial motion is only one of a number of instances where the universe refuses to stay within the boundaries of what is convenient for the human investigator inability to represent change of position in time in a spatial reference system is another case of the same kind I&#x27;m continually receiving letters from individuals who say that they need help because they are having difficulty in drawing a diagram to represent some motion in which change of position in time is involved according to the theoretical findings I cannot give any help in these cases because Motion in time cannot be represented in a spatial diagram we are able to represent lowp speeed Motion in such a diagram because no significant change of relative position in time is involved but as soon as the speed is great enough to introduce such a change um that&#x27;s basically like a relativistic change uh as Einstein would call it where you know um the clock space clock is altered um by are the um yeah uh or the time clock is altered um by a relativistic like so if the speed is great enough to introduce such a change the spatial diagram can no longer represent the motion accurately so if you have relativistic effects then you no longer are able to be able to fit into the reference system Einstein used the concept of curved space and so and such like to uh uh compensate for that that um you know um shortcoming of the reference system this is not something that is peculiar to the reciprocal system the reason for the difficulty at high speeds was unknown prior to the development of this new theoretical system but its existence has long been recognized there&#x27;s a matter of fact that has to be faced uh regardless of what physical theory is accepted in order to understand just what is involved it should be realized that a diagram or graphical representation of a motion does not give us a true picture of that motion unless the spatial positions of the moving object as shown in the reference system are consistent with the speeds for in instance if the distance between A and B increases by X in time T then the speed must be X overt otherwise the motion is not correctly represented but no spatial reference system can maintain this kind of consistency in representing high-speed motion the two Photon case that I have frequently discussed in my Publications demonstrates this point in this illustration we assume two photons A and B uh emitted simultaneously from an object o in opposite directions at the end of one unit of clock time A and B are separated by two units of distance and X over T = 2 over 1 = 2 but experiments show that the speed of a relative to B is only one so you know if you if you think about it logically you you would assume that they would be separate they would that they&#x27;re they&#x27;re separated by two units of distance so the exper but the experiments show that the speed is still one as opposed to two clearly either the distance entering into the determination of the speed differs from that measured by the reference system or the time differs from the uniform rate of progression that has to be assumed in order to make it possible to represent Motion in a spatial coordinate system in either case the special reference system I&#x27;m sorry the spatial reference system system is not capable of representing the motion accurately current physical Theory based on Einstein Einstein&#x27;s assumptions simply says that the coordinate positions have no meaning at high speeds as expressed by mhler quote in accelerated systems of reference the spatial and temporal coordinates thus lose every physical IAL significance they simply represent a certain arbitrary but unambiguous numbering of the physical events those who insists that we should be able to represent every motion by a spatial diagram are demanding something that has long been known to be impossible perhaps someday a device may be invented whereby change of position in three dimensions of of space and change of position in three dimensions of time can be accurately represented in a diagram that can be comprehended by the human mind in the meantime we will simply have to recognize that some natural phenomena are not amable to our charer diagrammatic modes of representation regardless of what kind of a theory we may use in our attempt to understand them the only difference between the reciprocal system and other theories so far as this point is concerned is that this new theoretical system has clearly identified the phenomena that the conventional systems of reference are unable to handle including some phenomena such as scalar motion that have her to for been overlooked largely because of the tendency to insist that nature must conform to what the human theorist find Convenient there is no good reason however why we should be disconcerted because nature refuses to make things easy for us if we start with the basic units of motion and build the possible combinations of these units step by step in accordance with the rules specified in the fundamental postulates of the reciprocal system we Define the physical Universe the universe of motion in all of its detail the universe as thus defined is rational logical and understandable the fact that some of its magnitudes cannot be represented graphically in the manner to which scientists have been accustomed there uh merely indicates that previous ideas as to the basic nature of these magnitudes are erroneous all right that is the end of that paper um so you know basically uh you need three dimensions of space to represent a one-dimensional scalar motion there are three dimensions of motion or three dimensions of scalar motion so there are two dimensions of scalar motion that cannot be represented in a spatial reference system and that&#x27;s all there is to it and so you have to be able to uh accept that and you have to be able to make accommodations in a different uh you know you have to make arrangements to compensate for that you know to figure out how you can do science even though uh these things do not uh fit into your reference system and now it is relevant to look at larsson&#x27;s second postulate which says that the Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary communative mathematics its primary ABS its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is ukian now so perhaps if we went to a non- idian geometry something other than XYZ coordinates perhaps we could um accommodate this uh scalar uh three dimensions of scalar emotion um and I know that people have tried that and uh one of larsson&#x27;s disciples uh the late Dr Bruce pet um has uh taken the uh Larson second postulate to task and he believes that we need to get rid of the uh U the ukian geometry part there and he substitutes Pro projective geometry for um ukian geometry ukian geometry is actually just a subset of projective geometry uh for pet there is a kind of a geometrical Cascade uh from uh you know from the the general to the specific you start with the projective geometry and then you move to aine geometry and then you move to metric geometry and then finally you move to ukian geometry and he concedes that there may be one or more other geometries in that Cascade in the middle there someplace but ukian geometry so is uh is not incorrect but it is just a small part of this whole projective geom geometrical system so you you know that is uh one approach at least um Larson more approached uh Larsson was aware of non- ukian geometries but he he felt that it was not worth it because they were just as comp complicated as um you know just basically assuming that ukian geometry doesn&#x27;t do the job and that you you need to use um you know different uh different things to uh be able to come up with answers even though you might not be able to represent the motion in the reference system you can still uh you know do calculations and you know basically if you&#x27;re if you&#x27;re uh you know you you can you can add two scalar motions um you you end up just taking taking the sum of things as opposed to being able to kind of integrate them uh we will see more about this as we go along uh now tomorrow I think we&#x27;re going to start with this uh uh another a short paper here that is called the inter Regional ratio and uh I&#x27;ve mentioned this before but uh the inter Regional ratio is basically the amount of information that is lost in the translation U from when you&#x27;re measuring from one sector of the universe to another sector um you know so when you&#x27;re kind of um changing reference Systems reference frames you&#x27;re losing a lot of the information um and uh you know maybe another term would be uh instead of inter Regional ratio you could use you know possibilities or igen States um you know potentialities um but LaRon uses the term inter Regional ratio and we will uh kind of look at uh how he derives the inter Regional ratio what it means and uh there are actually several different interregional ratios depending on uh what you&#x27;re measuring if it&#x27;s a subatomic particle or if it&#x27;s a uh an atom or what so we&#x27;ll get into that tomorrow but thanks for tuning in today and have a great day</p>
