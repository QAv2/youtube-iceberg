            <p>hello YouTube this is dr. Ronald abuse at founder and chair of the International side the unified science I&#x27;m president of trans Power Corporation a commercial and custom software manufacturing and certified systems engineering company I work as a mechanical and systems engineer and a theoretical physicist today we&#x27;re going to talk about hawking again and all about his logical theories just because he&#x27;s dead now doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t critique him so let&#x27;s just go over to nbcnews.com here and just take a brief look at this the title of this piece is Stephan Hawking lays out case for Big Bang without God my universe didn&#x27;t need any divine help to burst into being famed cosmologists Stephan Hawking for the packed house here at the California Institute of Technology Tuesday nights Wow so Hawking and his fellow conventional theorists believe in the Big Bang and also the heat death they&#x27;re very linear thinkers reciprocal system in contrast is cyclical now let&#x27;s go back to what I read here back in April of 2013 and I&#x27;ll take this as usual I wrote this paper the case against modern physics and it&#x27;s included in my work existence interactions a computational treatise of the reciprocal system the true theory of everything so how does the reciprocal system explain what really happens if there was that big man and of course doobie Larsen was the original developer of the reciprocal system and its extension to the metaphysical realm so in this theory the physical realm consists of space-time units whereas the metaphysical realm consists of non space-time units in other words it&#x27;s non-physical the physical universe is cyclical so we cannot prove a beginning after all it would be a one-time event but we can speculate having a property of creativity a portion of the non space-time units converted itself or themselves to space-time use the original displacements from in space-time photons of atoms and atoms were widely dispersed not concentrated there was no big bang and having the sub atoms and atoms and protons widely dispersed doesn&#x27;t violate any physical laws that we know of unlike the Big Bang Theory which finally just about everything we know having all the energy and matter in the universe constituting something smaller than an atom is a physical impossibility and please note here there is no infinite regress because a metaphysical realm is beyond space and time and thus has no beginning that is space-time are not properties of the metaphysical realm both the physical realm and the metaphysical realm are subject to ERISA Tilian logic there are no contradictions anywhere and by the way both physical realm and metaphysical realm are perfectly objective rational and understandable by the human brain there&#x27;s nothing supernatural or mystical about this theorem where philosophy so Hawking&#x27;s theory that something can come from nothing is utter nonsense study the reciprocal system and privilege for yourself the simplest treatment is in my work called the unnecessaries universe available at amazon.com the most advanced treatment is my work existence in action is the computational treatise of the reciprocal system to be theory of everything it contains thousands and thousands of equations and if you really brave and you want to apply the theory to your scientific and engineering work get my to database modules the reciprocal system micro cosmos module and there&#x27;s the system macro cosmos module these two modules verify the reciprocal system theory with thousands and thousands of calculations and comparing them with observed data so as usual thanks for your attention</p>
