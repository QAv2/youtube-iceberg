            <p>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. We got something. We got something. &gt;&gt; The reality of the phenomenon has become even more compelling. Here&#x27;s one right underneath us.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know whether to be terrified or excited. &gt;&gt; We are about ready to go launch another one, folks. Look at the cows. &gt;&gt; Just before we started to fire the rockets, the cows are acting very strangely. They were running across the field, grouping together, fighting.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s crazy. &gt;&gt; Let&#x27;s get this launch ready to go. &gt;&gt; Okay, we&#x27;re hot with the battery. &gt;&gt; All right, Kaylin, it&#x27;s all you. &gt;&gt; Good.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Look, look, look, look. &gt;&gt; What is that? What is that? &gt;&gt; We got We got something. Hold on. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a plane. I think &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s gone.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; No, that wasn&#x27;t a plane. We&#x27;d still see it if it was a plane. It&#x27;s gone. Yes, I saw it. It&#x27;s [music] gone.</p>
<p>What the hell was that? Do y&#x27;all realize what we are looking at here? Not only do we see the event with our eyes, we catch it on video. The cows apparently felt something. Yes, &gt;&gt; cuz they moved. And we have scientific [music] instruments corroborating that there is an anomaly in energy at [music] the same time. &gt;&gt; That is very important data right there.</p>
<p>I was remotely monitoring the security cameras mounted on my trailer that face the triangle area, but I saw that a really volatile lightning storm happened. That doesn&#x27;t look at all like what I was watching. I mean, I was watching a thunderstorm. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. What is that right there? Right.</p>
<p>Yes. &gt;&gt; You seeing that? &gt;&gt; Yes. What is that? &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know yet. &gt;&gt; All right. And then it&#x27;s just diving &gt;&gt; down.</p>
<p>Now, watch right here. It&#x27;s like it goes behind and through this cloud. You see that? And then look, look, it just stre off. &gt;&gt; What in the world? That&#x27;s clearly I mean call it a UFO if you want to cuz I don&#x27;t know what it is. It&#x27;s flying and it&#x27;s unidentified.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The whole herd is scattered through the entire field. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m getting something on the 1.6. &gt;&gt; My first thought was we should be looking up. What the hell is that in the sky? &gt;&gt; To the south. &gt;&gt; There it is.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Or I&#x27;m looking at it. There&#x27;s no red or green or white lights on it. &gt;&gt; That thing is big and spherical. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. It&#x27;s got a black dot in the center of it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; The 1.6 is [music] often seen in conjunction with UAP activity. &gt;&gt; It starts to track towards the east and then it started to turn towards the north, &gt;&gt; but it&#x27;s getting dim. &gt;&gt; It just disappeared. &gt;&gt; We were all mentally exhausted by whatever that was that appeared after our final rocket launch. It was the biggest UAP we&#x27;ve seen so far.</p>
<p>And it appeared to have come closer than any of the others as well. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something really interesting that I haven&#x27;t seen before that I&#x27;d like to get your eyes on. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; there. Right. &gt;&gt; What was that? &gt;&gt; This phenomena was even more intense than the UAP we saw just hours earlier with the rest of the team.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I think there&#x27;s enough data in the video footage that that this is more than a UAP, that this is a UFO. There is absolutely no conventional explanation. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve been talking about the area over the triangle being some sort of anomaly. What if gateway could &gt;&gt; Yeah. What if that&#x27;s the other end of the wormhole? &gt;&gt; So I was out there by the drill site.</p>
<p>I was standing on the road like right above the hole looking up at the guys and the ground shook. didn&#x27;t last as long as an earthquake, but just like that. And right as I held the walkie up to column, I saw something and just boom, real quick across the sky. No way. &gt;&gt; And it was spherical translucent white color.</p>
<p>Oh, right there. There it is. Look at that. &gt;&gt; Okay, I&#x27;m going to center on it. &gt;&gt; What in the heck? Look at that.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if it came out of the mesa or from behind the mea. Uh-huh. I know that others have reported that craft have been seen going into the mesa. Perhaps we&#x27;re looking at something coming out of the mesa. It &gt;&gt; said it was a a translucent white sphere.</p>
<p>I mean, look, how much more translucent white sphere can you get? &gt;&gt; This is such a fleeting event, but this this does look very solid. That&#x27;s a great catch. I&#x27;m excited about it. Keep your eye on the sky. Maybe you&#x27;ll see something else.</p>
<p>All right, guys. Let&#x27;s go ahead and turn the instruments on and do our first launch. &gt;&gt; Although our second rocket was smaller at 9 ft tall, it had plenty of power to shoot up through the anomaly. &gt;&gt; There it goes. &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; What was that bend all about? It &gt;&gt; cocked dramatically to the north so it couldn&#x27;t go up through the beam. &gt;&gt; If Brandon&#x27;s nearby, can you [music] bring him in real quick? &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, there&#x27;s the lasers. Yeah, I&#x27;m doing an instant playback. Do you see this? &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Wow. What the crap is that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It looks like it&#x27;s headed towards the apex. &gt;&gt; Eric captured one of the most vivid UAPs we&#x27;ve seen during [music] our experiments. &gt;&gt; This thing&#x27;s really clipping along.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. It disappeared &gt;&gt; and gone. &gt;&gt; Is it a portal? Are we seeing portals open? It looks It looks sort of amorphous. Is that what messed with our rockets? Did we cause it to appear by broadcasting the 1.6 GHz signal? And then where did it go? Skinwalker Ranch has been a haven for rumors about UAPs actually entering and exiting from the mesa portals and all kinds of other bizarre phenomena for decades, if not centuries. Tonight, we may have finally captured evidence that some of that could be true.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, make sure to save this right away. &gt;&gt; What the heck is that? That&#x27;s insane. You can get it right there. &gt;&gt; Cameron Fugle will fly Brandon, Eric, and Caleb in the helicopter above and safely off to the side of the triangle. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Wait, Thomas, look. Right. Right there. Right there. Right right above the horizon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s something moving this way. It&#x27;s like orange. &gt;&gt; Do you guys copy? It&#x27;s moving sound quickly. &gt;&gt; Just it just switched off like a switch. We still got a lot of rockets to launch here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; We&#x27;re getting a lot of static interference on the radio. &gt;&gt; You know, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen noise like this before. Broad spectrum. &gt;&gt; Oh, what the hell? &gt;&gt; What do you got? &gt;&gt; Just something went by. It looked like small orbs.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s another one. &gt;&gt; At the same time, we&#x27;re seeing these elevated levels of RF noise. He&#x27;s only seeing them in this night vision technology. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s one right underneath us. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know whether to be terrified or excited.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Brandon, I&#x27;m uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#x27;ve got this clenched feeling in my chest. &gt;&gt; I feel exactly the same. Pressing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a good description of it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, let&#x27;s take it down. &gt;&gt; Cameron made the right call. I say we close up shop and then start looking through the data. This is a camera on the exterior of the helicopter just above the mea went behind the mesa. &gt;&gt; It appears as if there&#x27;s a corresponding light and illuminated area what I interpret to be directly below this thing.</p>
<p>[music] &gt;&gt; You know where that is? It&#x27;s right by the petetroglyph. An indigenous group known as Blazing Bear performed an ancient drumming ceremony in the Eastfield right [music] near a petroglyph and a spiral of boulders up on the mesa that were made hundreds of years ago and are believed to represent an interdimensional portal. A mysterious anomaly appeared on the mesa right on the spiral of boulders during the ritual. Then two large sphere-like orbs suddenly appeared and flew right into it. Did we stimulate the same thing last night? come out of the mesa.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It looked just like what I was seeing in my night vision at high altitude. &gt;&gt; You realize that we&#x27;re talking about objects looking [music] like they&#x27;re flying into the actual stone of the mesa and then appearing and coming back out. &gt;&gt; I have to think this is going on more than we have suspected. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. It&#x27;s awful lucky for us to fly once and see this, right? Awfully lucky.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
