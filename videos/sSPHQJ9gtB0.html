            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>this is the full case of the mysterious  4chan whistleblower now this is a man   who worked as a crash retrieval specialist  for the government um for several years up   until 2021 and he has intimate knowledge  of what the US currently knows about the   UFO phenomenon he says we should be  paying more attention to the oceans   what we see is this white Tic Tac looking </p>
<p>object just above the surface of the water   pointing North South and it&#x27;s going north south  east west it&#x27;s just radically moving forward back   left right at will it was freaking huge have it  was going really slow it had these big lights in   it it it didn&#x27;t make a sound as I&#x27;m pulling up  it&#x27;s kind of starting to cross my nose and it   starts to accelerate and within about less than  a second as I start to pull nose onto it and it   crosses right in front of me it just goes poof </p>
<p>and it&#x27;s gone not just radar but visual sighting   infrared sensors telescopic evidence now we have  multiple sightings by multiple modes and so the   burden of proof has shifted I personally and I  know they feel the same way it doesn&#x27;t matter   to me whether you believe me or not it doesn&#x27;t it  only matters to you because we know what we saw we   know what we have you need to see that you need to  understand that that&#x27;s it okay welcome to 55 folks   um we were recently voted uh the most humble up </p>
<p>and coming podcast on YouTube we choose to go to the not four not 5 not 6 not S I live so obviously the UFO space is quite wild  there just tons of stories and claims swirling   around um tons of disinformation just pumped  out there a few grifters and a few people who   may be embellish things that&#x27;s everywhere you go  I think there&#x27;s plenty of evidence out there if   you know where to look um if you&#x27;re kind of new  to the topic I would just look at these cases   and ignore a lot of the other stuff but I guess </p>
<p>we&#x27;re kind of ignoring our own advice here cuz   today um we are not sticking with these cases  we are um venturing off into wild speculation   so this 4chan whistleblower is a fellow who uh he  did like a question and answer session this was   back in 2023 uh where he detailed his past work  in a covert government program and kind of laid   out his knowledge of the UFO phenomenon so make  what you will of this but I think it stands out   to a lot of people because of like how detailed </p>
<p>he gets and how quickly he responds to questions   with weirdly specific detail but it&#x27;s a fun and  compelling read and I put the link to like the   actual archived thread in the description here if  you just want to go read it instead of listening   to us speculate about it and yeah there footage  um if you&#x27;re curious I just took my bike uh down   to the mighty mighty Mississippi River this past  weekend um and rode along a stretch of it at the   end of this road uh there were a bunch of huge </p>
<p>Riverfront Mansions which was pretty cool um so   I thought that might be a little more interesting  than just the screen being on this lip sync of our   voices the whole time but anyways yeah let&#x27;s uh  get into this question answer I&#x27;ll read off uh   the question that someone asked this guy and then  what he responded with and later on he does say   something that kind of caught my attention and  might shed some insight into the legitimacy of   all this um and we&#x27;ll kind of go over how we both </p>
<p>feel about this overall at the end so his first   post said I have intimate knowledge of what the US  currently knows about UFOs minus the last 2 years   he says UFOs are primarily unmanned drones they  are built to spec each time they are deployed and   they&#x27;re created by a mobile construction facility  in the Atlantic Ocean and this facility destroys   anything that comes close to it and it will  disappear for days if it&#x27;s approached aggressively   and the US believes the facility has been active </p>
<p>on Earth for at least 100 years or much longer   he says fire away on questions I&#x27;ll answer what  I can you won&#x27;t be disappointed um do they know   who or what is creating these craft he says yes as  mentioned earlier the mobile construction unit is   responsible for their deployment and construction  um any potential that they are made by higher   branch of US Government he says absolutely not  what allows them to fly so fast what technology   he says gravity manipulation and the materials </p>
<p>they are constructed from um which he doesn&#x27;t   list here he might get into that later um  this one someone must have asked what the   construction unit is driven or what operates  it he says we think the construction unit is   driven by artificial intelligence the response  time to threats is almost instant and usually   very calculated and well thought out so I guess  that means like not necessarily alien living in   this thing he&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s just some sort of unit </p>
<p>that&#x27;s programmed for whatever tasks of deploying   um UFOs for different purposes and observation  or whatever its uh ultimate goal is um I don&#x27;t   know that he&#x27;s saying there aren&#x27;t some beings  in this unit though um he says you should all   pay attention to this the majority of UFOs as I  mentioned previously are built to spec and purpose   this is why there are always different sizes the  content and Equipment usually mimic the intended   purpose too so basically saying they&#x27;re different </p>
<p>for the most part built to some specific use or   job whatever the the mission goal I guess it&#x27;s  just built to serve that specific purpose it&#x27;s   not like they have a fleet of standard ones that  I don&#x27;t know yeah I don&#x27;t even know how to talk   about it really what kind of goals would they does  it get into what kind of goals they have I think   yeah more more generally there&#x27;s some questions  that that get into that I&#x27;m not sure what page   that&#x27;ll be on do the uaps he&#x27;s returned back to </p>
<p>the manufacturing unit he says yes some come in   and leave the planet but very rarely usually the  same number that comes in goes out unless special   circumstances arise it feels more like a carrier  but with construction capability so he says rarely   there&#x27;s ones actually coming from space or leaving  the planet but most of the activity is just um to   and from this ocean facility um what are the  purposes of the UAP surveillance of humans is   the question he says the US believes they are not </p>
<p>here to harm us they only seem interested in us   once they realize we are destroying things around  us including each other one of the officials in   charge said something that stuck with me he said  they act like keepers of a zoo uninterested in   the daily life of wildlife until there&#x27;s a  problem so it&#x27;s a little spooky they&#x27;re just   monitoring us or something yeah to some unknown  end another question has any form of intelligible   communication been established with whatever is </p>
<p>uh running this thing or or producing these UFOs   um he says yes it also depends on your Viewpoint  they mostly want very little to do with us until   we start to talk about war and nuclear options  it&#x27;s one of the reasons why you see them so often   at critical events so there is referring to a lot  of the sightings have been in regard like over   military bases and I think specifically bases that  have some sort of nuclear activ weird this guy   asks can I approach that facility without being </p>
<p>attacked he says LOL the last unit we saw approach   the facility didn&#x27;t even have time to communicate  they were being attacked before it was over   yeah just sucked sucked underwater yeah if it  was a airplane unit or boat or submarine I don&#x27;t   know I guess I was yeah just get recycled into  the next UFO manufacturer uh this guy asks are   they friends he says they cut their losses when  crashes are recovered same with Personnel um it   must have been a different question but he says </p>
<p>zookeepers aren&#x27;t friends with the animals which   I guess is true but most zookeepers kind of like  the animals I would think yeah if you&#x27;re working   if you&#x27;re working at just an analogy I guess they  also feed and water the yeah shelter them yeah I   don&#x27;t know where the analy ends yeah I&#x27;m not  being fed by an alien that you know of unless   we&#x27;re alien food have you ever talked to a local  farmer seeing what&#x27;s behind the eye dig into it a   little question do you know if the entities behind </p>
<p>the UFOs are native to the Earth like are they an   older civilization Breakaway civilization or a  civilization of humans that escaped a previous   cycle of cataclysm due to their Advanced Tech that  sounds kind of up GR Graham Hancock&#x27;s alley should   have them on ancient civilization you could  speculate wildly on this what what what do we   do to get him on I don&#x27;t know we could somehow  Forge our viewership numbers and maybe he won&#x27;t   catch it you know like make a fake website you&#x27;d </p>
<p>have to see like I&#x27;m he&#x27;s interested with anyone   with reach you know I&#x27;m sure yeah because that  helps helps him so I would say that&#x27;d be the way   to do it just little forgery little forgery real  quick probably have to brush up our communication   skills or else it&#x27;ll be obvious right away that  we&#x27;re not we don&#x27;t have the viewership we claim   to have but the answer to that um what what these  entities are um he says he has limited expertise   since my role is more craft SL analysis the US </p>
<p>believes they are foreign to our world a previous   cataclysm could make sense they also show up in  times of strife such as natural events um I&#x27;m not   sure what that&#x27;s referring to natural disasters  or what um okay question have you tried sending   in a raft of hippies the AI May not recognize  them as a threat it&#x27;s kind of a joke peace man   says based on previous disappearances and acts of  hostility we believe the construction facility or   carrier has learned what is and isn&#x27;t hostile </p>
<p>usually it will just move away or stay deep   under the water it doesn&#x27;t fire on civilian boats  for example exceptions apply exceptions I don&#x27;t   know what&#x27;s he&#x27;s wording here exceptions apply  we have some word wrong there anyways uh I guess   exception we have seen one or two go missing  usually after sharp turns so well if you&#x27;re   civilian boat you&#x27;re just going where you&#x27;re going  apparently it can it can say okay they&#x27;re not a   threat they&#x27;re just passing by but if you have to </p>
<p>change direction then it doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re   doing just take you out because you&#x27;re a possible  threat so they just disappear or what is that   apparently he yeah he never gets into like what  specifically happens to things that approach it   I I don&#x27;t know if it just like sinks you or like  actually I don&#x27;t know Vapor atomizes you probably   yeah something you can&#x27;t imagine um how about  the destination of the space orbs so the ones   that the few that do actually leave the planet </p>
<p>is Jupiter a potential destination I believe   they are keeping a massive orb inside of the gas  giant though I have no evidence but many dreams   of it that&#x27;s the question oh okay I thought  that was no that&#x27;s not guy yeah no I would   wouldn&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t be very convincing if that  was our whistleblower guy gets into dreams of   Jupiter this guy says no idea if it is a project  I haven&#x27;t seen it no orbs out of the construction   facility just UFOs okay know what that means </p>
<p>so what units have been lost approaching   this machine why have they not sent a Seawolf  which I think is a submarine uh to investigate   says everything you can think of really at one  point nuclear missiles were being toyed with again   and we deployed Fighters and a sub with serious  intent everything except the sub was lost so he   doesn&#x27;t mention a year there but he says the US  was messing with missiles a little too much and   the unit started to deploy more UFOs I think you </p>
<p>can kind of infer they tried to go investigate the   unit and everything but the sub was lost um how  have they come to the conclusion the UAP being   released are ET if they don&#x27;t know what the U UAP  are to begin with or if there&#x27;s nothing inside of   them it&#x27;s a pretty big jump to go right to and he  says they crash sometimes Parts fail and gravity   engines near the surface of the planet can be  like Crossing an intersection we recover these and   sometimes find passengers we mostly see drones now </p>
<p>back in the earlier days we saw a lot more piloted   craft he says so that kind of goes with what that  David grush saying how we have uh oh that guy he   went on Rogan probably about a year and a half ago  he did testified in front of Congress and stuff as   like a whistleblower on some of these programs  and what what the government has evidence of his   argument was that higher-ups have had keyed  him in on everything they know and stuff it   wasn&#x27;t experiences he&#x27;d had he had had or anything </p>
<p>like that yeah I don&#x27;t really know what to make of   those types of guys either it seems like some kind  of planned doesn&#x27;t seem like he just chose to be a   whistleblower you know there&#x27;s some kind of agenda  with what he&#x27;s saying like whether government   agenda or you think he has a personal agenda no  not personal I wouldn&#x27;t no oh like it&#x27;s something   different to throw you off the scent of yeah not  like he&#x27;s making it up to get personally famous   but like yeah I would think like some or most most </p>
<p>of it&#x27;s true but there&#x27;s also things like designed   to throw people off of certain you know just Mass  kind of mass confusion slash yeah I don&#x27;t know or   it&#x27;s just a kind of a planned soft disclosure  where they just want to kind of get people used   to talking about this stuff gradually so it&#x27;s  not just like not just shock yeah anyways um   well you always figure you if when the government  starts talking about it people there&#x27;s the first   hearing of it yeah you know it&#x27;s not like </p>
<p>they find it Tuesday and then we found this   and it&#x27;s your right to know yeah it&#x27;s like this is  something they found in the 40s and 80 years later   they here&#x27;s our weekly recap of everything we know  yeah right citizens yeah yeah not quite but the   one thing that stood out about this where he says  we mostly see drones now but back in the earlier   days we saw more piloted that doesn&#x27;t seem to  make sense I don&#x27;t know what the reason reason for   that would be I guess it seems like if it&#x27;s some </p>
<p>ancient or whatever super Advanced civilization   like why would seems like whatever they&#x27;re doing  like they wouldn&#x27;t really be advancing or you   know changing their technology like what would  why would more have been piloted and now it&#x27;s   something different it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s like our drone  technology is rapidly advancing but that&#x27;s because   it&#x27;s new in the it&#x27;s like yeah I don&#x27;t know once  you have it figured out to get to the level that   it&#x27;s been at you you wouldn&#x27;t yeah I see what </p>
<p>you&#x27;re saying like over the course of 40 years   it may not you wouldn&#x27;t all of a sudden get to  a place where okay well now we can have unmanned   crafts like we have a we have a whole station that  can build them underwater and Destroy anything   that comes near it but then over the course of  how many years like well we&#x27;ve got to the ability   where we don&#x27;t need to have somebody flying this  thing yeah so I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve always thought it   made more sense that things like that that were </p>
<p>drones little aliens in them sort of yeah little   green guy stick and Rudder I mean this he this  guy does claim that there have been crashes with   beings in them um whether they&#x27;re AI beings or  what they are I don&#x27;t know if he gets into that um   this question why do you not know anything about  the last two years just curious he says moved on   from the project because of New Management that  didn&#x27;t trust older proven methods so management   M oldest time running the place like they&#x27;re </p>
<p>flipping a house got kicked out so um question   um oh this is a question about him saying the last  unit that was attacked and couldn&#x27;t communicate   before it was over for him um any details on  that attack he says normal approach details   pilot responsive and actively talking the feed  cuts out pilot still talking suddenly nothing poor   guy likely had no idea it was likely a suicide  Mission based on what we&#x27;ve seen the construction   facility has far superior weapons than the UFOs do </p>
<p>this weapon destroys the matter it hits entirely   okay that&#x27;s how it works just vaporizes like  you said atomizes it um it also messes up any   Electronics in the vicinity I don&#x27;t know I guess  it would makees sense how it could stay hidden   but that&#x27;s also convenient way to explain why  we can&#x27;t see it or anything you both way um the   contents question is the contents and Equipment  usually mimic the intended purpose too like the   equipment share a pattern specific to its purpose </p>
<p>he says yes usually when we find a thinner model   for example it would have no pilot and a lot of  sensory Hardware my favorite is finding one that   is fitted for research if we are lucky we find  things we have never seen before before I left   we were looking at what we thought was a lab of  some so I don&#x27;t know maybe he gets into this later   but he says his job is like the crash retrieval  he&#x27;s like the second stage um so yeah what I don&#x27;t   really understand about that is if they have all </p>
<p>that ability and Technology why don&#x27;t they have   some sort of like when it does crash well number  one I would feel like they should be crash proof   but number two I feel like if it did crash then it  should have self-destruct button or something if   they didn&#x27;t want unless they want it to unless  they want some to crash from time to time yeah   that seems to make sense at one point he says that  crashes they just cut their losses they&#x27;re just   like whatever I guess they don&#x27;t send another UFO </p>
<p>to try to retrieve it or you know anything like   that he says so um question I&#x27;ve had two orange  orbs approach me within 100 feet one night glowing   translucent but rather dim like the Setting Sun  seen through smog they&#x27;re flying in 45 degree form   um about 50 mph and he says research and science  vessels sometimes have mobile light producing uh   cameras in quotes used for multiple purposes  from scouting to keeping threats contained or   at Bay these are shaped like Hammers and when </p>
<p>operated are extremely bright red lights are a   sign of hostility or caution to deploy weapons um  orange lights are usually for spotting minerals or   living things so a lot of the videos recently have  been orange uh orbs I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve seen   those it&#x27;s like with all the well it&#x27;s all those  sightings that kind of started they&#x27;re all over   now it seems a lot of them are like these orange  orbs and they also have like the bigger drones   with the kind of more traditional air flashing </p>
<p>lights and stuff they look some the drones look   slightly more like something but a lot in a lot  of the videos they&#x27;re like interacting lights I   guess he would would say the Orange is whatever  research or science but red is hostility it&#x27;s   good to know stay away from a red light there&#x27;s  some video I should try to find don&#x27;t tell that   to the biohackers out there this guy says as  soon as I blink my flashlight at them this is   the guy asking the question um they accelerated </p>
<p>to several thousand nods and disappeared over   the horizon searched YouTube and found several  videos of the same objects mostly near San Diego   he says I&#x27;m not surprised the range on those is  quite large the UFO was like somewhere above you   quite high up um that&#x27;s the end of that question  are aliens human or humanoid he says humanoid very   humanoid so later on he says they&#x27;re kind of  similar to what uh just like the small bodies   big eyes you know kind of what how they&#x27;re </p>
<p>depicted quite often I think they&#x27;re depicted   that way because that&#x27;s the common depiction and  whatever sighting claims or interaction claims so   um he basically confirms that he doesn&#x27;t go with  some other you know that there&#x27;s some six-legged   creature with whatever says they&#x27;re the small  humanoid type um question will there be disclosure   anytime soon um he says the Air Force is extremely  frustrated with the lack of progress on their end   we felt similar but are unable to share details </p>
<p>with them so he&#x27;s cut off from airport he&#x27;s some   some Advanced program he claims works for well  well beyond what the Air Force knows so I&#x27;d   assume this was a sort of AI design that seems to  be advanced yet already prepared for the get-go um   he says basically when designed to let&#x27;s say be  a minor you will usually see Hardware dedicated   to resource collection on the vessel if the  vessel is something scientific you may encounter   things like tools and has previously mentioned </p>
<p>something akin to a lab we thought of it more as a   quote I need to go hiking so the construction  facility builds you a car UFO and packs it full   of hiking supplies and even adjust the shape to  fit what was packed so the AI creates these very   specific to their purpose do you think there are  fewer piloted crafts because the population of the   facility if any is declining says no the common  consensus is that they are just being careful I&#x27;ve   heard recovery of living Pilots usually doesn&#x27;t </p>
<p>go well for either of us we suspect they piloted a   lot of initial craft due to early complications um  we also saw more crashes early complications like   I don&#x27;t that doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense seems well  if they&#x27;ve been there for thousands of years well   yeah on the one the one hand he said a hundred  years or possibly more but that seems a little too   convenient unless they just showed up because  we set off some sort of advanced civiliz Iz   ation signal they detected something but the more </p>
<p>plausible seems like something that&#x27;s always been   here or something any body&#x27;s recovered show any  ranges of Aging we can recognize I wonder if most   of the inhabitants are either old or dead at this  point though younger bodies would disprove that   I suppose says no idea about age not my specialty  and asking about it would have been a net negative   especially now previous higher ups were getting  better about being open with information since   Discovery happened quicker mentions higher ups </p>
<p>a lot what do the passengers look like are they   biological Andor Andro bio so not robots they&#x27;re  at least biolog biological or biologically injur   do you know anything about people such as Steven  Greer Lou alzando or whatever are these people in   the know or larpers or controlled misinformation  Etc um he says no idea one name sticks out you   didn&#x27;t mention mentioning Bob Lazar by name would  likely have you taken out back and put down like a   dog do the math do the math on why which I wasn&#x27;t </p>
<p>sure what math to do on on why there it seems like   he&#x27;s saying Lazar is telling the truth um and  that&#x27;s one thing that makes me more skeptical   of this guy because I don&#x27;t trust I don&#x27;t really  believe or trust Bob Lazar at all I think there&#x27;s   a lot there&#x27;s some definitely some something a  lot going on with the phenomena overall but I   don&#x27;t like I don&#x27;t trust Bob lazar&#x27;s story so yeah  anyone that confirms or backs up him it&#x27;s kind of   a red flag to me were you the one who sent me the </p>
<p>body language expert oh yeah breaking down Laars   well it&#x27;s the panel of four of them and they had  good points like literally every time Rogan asked   a specific on physics or why something he would  always give you know some excuse and would go off   topic you know kind of like a politician you know  would just kind of kind of answer it but then at   the end you realize he never answered the specific  question and yeah looking down a lot cuz yeah you   just watch the interview like that and whatever he </p>
<p>talks the whole time and it all seems interesting   you know it doesn&#x27;t seem like he&#x27;s lying but  yeah when you go analyze it and realize really   answered specifics yeah that&#x27;s part of it do you  think he might have been the person doing this   thread a long elaborate plan to give himself some  credibility yeah I don&#x27;t know if that Theory&#x27;s   out there could be because he does yeah he gets  into Lazar a little bit later with the element   115 Lazar claimed uh propels these things and he </p>
<p>had he had actually took some of the element Lazar   said yeah um yeah I don&#x27;t really understand I mean  cuz that whole thing couldn&#x27;t any I mean it&#x27;s just   the next step in the periodic table right so yeah  I guess I don&#x27;t know enough I don&#x27;t know I mean   he just CU he said it before it existed then they  found it yeah but it was just the next but I mean   you can kind of do the math from what I understand  about it you could say well yeah there could be   an element yeah you know whatever 117 yeah and </p>
<p>just would have 117 electrons and 117 protons or   whatever the whatever it is it&#x27;s been a while but  yeah I don&#x27;t know it seemed like when I listened   to it anyways I thought well yeah I mean you  could predict the existence of of that based on   the rest of the table if you just keep going yeah  Haven found it it&#x27;s like yeah he talked about it   before we found it but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s some it  wasn&#x27;t like some crazy idea that yeah I could be   way off but that&#x27;s what I kind of remember think </p>
<p>um out of everything ever found regarding UFOs in   general what is your personal favorite he says  new engine was deployed with a very large model   that I&#x27;d never seen before we usually see three to  five gravity producing engines this one had seven   favorite object or find probably the lab since  we never fully understood how it worked before it   was destroyed this question producing engine huh  yeah that&#x27;s seems the consensus on how how they   operate are the ones that change direction and </p>
<p>velocity instantaneously and stuff type of gravity   manipulation not not a rocket propulsion obviously  if something there&#x27;s if it&#x27;s actually a physical   object moving like that question this makes me  wonder whether a meaningful distinction between   scientific study and amusement still exists for  them if it ever did he says this was before my   time but they talked about a bus type UFO that had  more occupants than Hardware most of the intended   purpose appeared to be for physical viewing I </p>
<p>wondered if they ever just wanted to look at the   animals so kind of taken a tour tourist oh look at  that City holy cow that&#x27;s farmer let&#x27;s fly by him   he won&#x27;t tell anyone no one will believe him oh  that&#x27;s funny so a bus UFO there is a one of the   the most I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;d call it worthy  accounts was the Phoenix Lights you that was like   a people estimate it was like some people say like  a mile wide but several hundred yards from all   the eyewitness account just this giant UFO that </p>
<p>just slowly moved over the city and that one&#x27;s   interesting cuz all the eyewitness accounts are  like right after dark I forget what month it was   I think it was like six or 7 p.m. so probably a  winter month I guess um of this object coming over   it&#x27;s like a V type shape had five lights and a V  formation just massive silent slow moving whatever   thousands of eyewitnesses in Phoenix reported it </p>
<p>and then like at 9 or 10 p.m. local I don&#x27;t know   what air air base that is but they dropped flares  in a V formation over the mountain range so then   everyone who had kind of heard about this initial  one then saw that like oh it&#x27;s back or whatever   and there&#x27;s tons of pictures of those flares and  that also or that often gets like Mis interpreted   as this this was the UFO no that&#x27;s just flares </p>
<p>but that&#x27;s seemingly why they dropped them just to   create Mass confusion yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;d be a long  long incident to look into on its own uh question   this is a strangely recurrent theme at a minimum  they have psychotronic devices of some sort   um I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s referencing there  so I guess this is just like a thread someone   pulled out all the all this guy&#x27;s answers so we&#x27;re  missing some of the things other people say um he   says this reminded me of something my first year </p>
<p>he doesn&#x27;t say what year was his first year UFO   crashes they remove the bodies well before my  team arrives we start to look and the craft is   unpowered at first a few minutes later the craft  powers on and starts to close up we radio out and   get a response from the unit removing one of the  occupants that they are working on it ship Powers   off and the other team asks if we are good to go  no mention of how access was possible I suspect   the pilot may have interfaced with the ship by </p>
<p>remote or psionic who was speculating not like   a cockpit with controls they just kind of control  it with their mind or it&#x27;s remote operated um they   have lots of tools they use or lots of tools they  use produce light if this is still about the orb   the shell you may have seen was just the light  around the device I call the hammer I don&#x27;t know   what he means by the hammer he says that&#x27;s  kind of what the camera device is for their   observation it&#x27;s just like a construction Hammer </p>
<p>does that just refer to thing with just I don&#x27;t   know like a hammer shark you call that a hammer  just like two ends and a pull between them uh   question are there more than one construction  facility you mentioned the Bermuda Triangle   however there are a lot of Usos off of the West  Coast and the Americas as well he says I suspect   there may be since we only watch the Atlantic  Ocean and the UFOs we track normally Don&#x27;t Stray   far from home base asking about it would have </p>
<p>been a bad move which that doesn&#x27;t seem I don&#x27;t   know I feel like if you were in the position this  guy claims to be like you&#x27;d know if you know so   much about this one you would know that there  are more it seems like I don&#x27;t know why asking   about it is a bad move yeah that too he&#x27;s I mean  he&#x27;s claiming there&#x27;s all this compartmentalized   secrecy so that no one knows too much know the  deal is what he&#x27;s saying the structure is but   yeah at some point he like kind of concedes some </p>
<p>of these things like after someone else brings it   up like oh yeah that that could be you know but  so I don&#x27;t know maybe he just doesn&#x27;t know but   it also seems like he probably would would have  known just to me um question I read somewhere   some UFO navigation systems require an ET whose  own personal wavelength has been specifically   tuned to the neural network of The Craft be  interesting to see where he read that more   reading it um he says this track somewhat for </p>
<p>me when we look at the craft we usually have to   force certain things to work two teams come behind  mine so that could be dedicated to understanding   of The Craft um can you tell us what the beings  look like physically usual gray type or big ears   he says imagine the typical Grays you see on TV  just means depiction and TV and movies and stuff   I&#x27;ve seen two corpses so maybe there are different  species but I&#x27;ve never laid eyes on anything about   their culture name Etc he says rumors mostly they </p>
<p>almost never want anything to do with us mentions   of Destruction or Warfare apparently change their  attitude pretty quickly so they&#x27;re not uh they&#x27;re   kind of researching us and keeping each other  it&#x27;s kind of a theme which theories as to why   that would be I mean why would you well if you  weren&#x27;t interested why would you care yeah we   get some theories after I think um probably my  top theory is that it&#x27;s like us from the future   I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like aliens I don&#x27;t think </p>
<p>it&#x27;s like aliens from another planet based on my   extensive research so that&#x27;s what there&#x27;s one guy  who kind of talks about that theory some Michael   Masters that just seems to make you know it&#x27;s some  mix of that or some psychic Phenom type but that   would make sense to me if it&#x27;s like us cuz they&#x27;re  like they&#x27;re kind of like what you could imagine   a human would evolve into yeah you know based on  not needing like frail they say they&#x27;re just you   know no muscle or anything just tiny you know big </p>
<p>heads FOC focused whatever they use their brains   big eyes no ear I don&#x27;t know well maybe I don&#x27;t  understand time travel or whatever I guess good   enough but I don&#x27;t know why they would need to if  they were already existed in the future why would   they need to come back and prevent us from total  Destruction cuz if they were there then the total   Destruction wouldn&#x27;t have happened that&#x27;s a good  point me multiple uh what is time when you think   about it be multiple timelines going on yeah I </p>
<p>haven&#x27;t got that far also I&#x27;ll crack that it was   me and I was like a 3ft tall gray bald alien I  would want to stroll down Maine and you know hey   everybody get the people talking yeah maybe that  would throw off the timeline too much yeah that   could well I guess you can&#x27;t yeah they say not to  you know do too much then you won&#x27;t yeah part of   the problem now is if you had a whatever closeup  HD video no one&#x27;s going to believe you anymore   yeah AI so either it&#x27;s too you know either it&#x27;s </p>
<p>oh why is it always so far away and and so blurry   or if it&#x27;s too close oh that&#x27;s a fake so there&#x27;s  really nowhere unless like it&#x27;s something happens   at a live event you know I guess or or enough  people Super Bowl see things in person how crazy   would that be just halftime a UFO lands oh it&#x27;s  part of the halftime show wow what a realistic   halftime I love that halftime show seems so yeah  I don&#x27;t know I feel like it&#x27;s so far under a this   is cool but can we get to the second half okay </p>
<p>yeah we get it you&#x27;re here if you&#x27;re not going   to kill us just go back to what you&#x27;re doing yeah  bring bring Mahomes back out let&#x27;s see if he can   start booing them three straight yeah boo put up  a presentation the secrets of the universe Boo   get off half time&#x27;s over yeah that&#x27;s probably what  would happen maybe not at the Super Bowl CU those   aren&#x27;t really biggest football fans but yeah maybe  like a AFC or NFC Championship game yeah just said   it dealers game just Pittsburgh with their towels </p>
<p>up yeah seems like how it would go um yeah I&#x27;m on   page nine of 35 no my I do have I tried to cross  out the irrelevant ones but I&#x27;ll try to skim over   ones that some of them are kind of redundant I can  also go back I can just let you go I can just let   you let you go and then we&#x27;ll talk at the end well  yeah jump in whenever but I&#x27;ll Breeze through a   lot here um so question another massive problem  is determining which aspects of the encounters   are physically real versus psychological whatever </p>
<p>phenomenon um he says we rely on our biological   and technological sensors too much to be able  to truly understand the phenomenon in my opinion   was his response um yeah that one we don&#x27;t have  the context for he says tensions increased after   Roswell between us and Soviets um I don&#x27;t know  why in relation to the nuclear site incursions   airspace violations has also been increasing  tensions um I guess one thing I get I guess if the   sightings increased after um we first exploded the </p>
<p>nuclear bomb but I don&#x27;t get how having MH those   sightings with war you know like how they&#x27;re  keeping us out of War Yeah Yeah by just Haven   sighting there&#x27;s one case of them a UFO like  I mean it&#x27;s hard because all you go on is like   these retired military testimonies so this one  has multiple people who were there testify of this   that some unknown object they&#x27;re running a nuclear  warhead test they launched it off the coast of   California and UF UFO came in and like said a </p>
<p>light beam or something it circled it from four   angles and after it Zapped it from four angles the  thing just dropped out of the sky and was disabled   I think that was in the 60s or 70s so I guess  that&#x27;s one but yeah we dropped bombs on Japan and   they didn&#x27;t like intercept those yeah so unless  that was like what set off some signal in theory   well they should have had their signal before that  cuz they doing from the test yeah so I don&#x27;t know   who knows what maybe they just really yeah I don&#x27;t </p>
<p>know um do you believe we are under the control   in some way or were sometime in history says  possibly but I have no way of knowing the higher   ups I worked for seemed hellbent on discovering  more about them usually not equality found among   controlled so he&#x27;s saying the higher-ups if  they were controlled they wouldn&#x27;t have been as   interested in discovering more about them I guess  as what were the main reasons for the crashes I&#x27;d   think random lightning or freak accident seeing </p>
<p>how advanced they are says you&#x27;d be surprised how   many mistakes they make especially the farther  back you look one area they seem to avoid like   the plague we suspect is due to issues with  gravity and flight before they figured it out   we collected quite a few mishaps there they&#x27;ve  tried to shoot some down mostly over nuclear   incidents but failed miserably do you see written  symbols in the craft he says yes usually marked by   doorways and key objects written language appears </p>
<p>frequently on tools and critical items question   it reads like their objective is to observe and  preserve he says I agree the idea was pitched   that they are waiting for us to mature or perhaps  something bigger to arrive and they don&#x27;t want us   to ruin the planet in the meantime so that&#x27;s a  separate Theory that&#x27;s out there it&#x27;s like some   sort of initial scouting Mission doing research  and yeah want the plant to go into a nuclear   Holocaust before they can whatever if they&#x27;re </p>
<p>planning to kill us and inhabit it or what   else their goal would or they&#x27;re just like a I  don&#x27;t know Universe cop just trying making sure   no funny business like America&#x27;s a world cop yeah  insert themselves everywhere this could just be a   galactic whatever fine just no funny business well  they haven&#x27;t over that&#x27;s true that we know of yeah   we&#x27;re not really a peaceful hands-off foreign  policy policy probably not the best um what do   you believe to be the reason for the upt uptick </p>
<p>in sightings once again my knowledge was cut off   about two years ago if you mean very recently  my guess would be the Russians in us having a   little secret dance among themselves when nuclear  anything gets involved we see large deployments   for long periods of time Strife seems to be the  catalyst so that I mean this was all a year and   a half ago but that makes sense now there&#x27;s more  nuclear tensions developing you have all these   sightings coming up since November um what is </p>
<p>your scariest experience while engaging with the   phenomenon what was your favorite if any doors  closing on us as mentioned above made me wish I   had brown pants still fascinated with the lab we  found he mentions this lab a lot it was damaged   by accident and I never really got much time with  it are you aware of any foreign alien Tech that   was s successfully verse engineered so this one  was interesting he says yes we used to laugh at   Russian and Chinese designs we stopped laughing at </p>
<p>China when they produced an operational but buggy   version of their mining equipment still stumps  most of our Engineers China also lies out of its   ass but from what we saw we deemed it operational  and working countries listed above have flight   capable craft just not very good ones I&#x27;m not sure  how if he doesn&#x27;t even know a lot thought about   our own program how we would know what China had  it seemed weirdly weirdly detailed to go into that   what is the energy source you mentioned Bob so I </p>
<p>think I know already says correcti is the power   source is element 115 thing no one talks about is  that usually they seal it within the craft because   it produces its own gravity Bob Lazar handled  element5 which was already pulled out which is   rare and weird protocol n now is that only one  person is allowed to handle 15 I was forbidden   from touching interacting with it we still have  trouble producing it so yeah I don&#x27;t know what   can&#x27;t really visualize that so what to make of </p>
<p>that um how do UFOs travel in the context of those   Tic Tac reports and Bob lazar&#x27;s report where they  seemingly jump through SpaceTime and and light to   appear in a new location uh this is common when  moving at high speeds from a standstill or slow   speed initially gravity distorts time and the  object inside the field can stagger when traveling   um okay so someone finally someone asked how are  you able to talk about any of this didn&#x27;t you   swear to secrecy he says yes liver cancer sucks </p>
<p>so he says he&#x27;s I guess you could interpret it as   whatever he&#x27;s going to die soon so that&#x27;s partly  but he&#x27;s not saying everything just a little bit   um so or it could just be an unrelated statement  yeah just also that sucks yeah no one asked me   about that uh wouldn&#x27;t the government already have  their eye on you considering you could turn out to   be a loose end I says I&#x27;m not going on national  TV or radio I&#x27;m on a 4chan board I&#x27;m sure they   look at stuff like this but cancer makes you a </p>
<p>little makes you feel a little different also   did you or your co-workers experience strange  things outside of work okay that was the other   question I had and I guess I&#x27;ll hear his answer  but if they have the ability to just vaporize   whatever that comes near why they allow yeah I  don&#x27;t know I get I&#x27;ll save my thoughts to the end   I guess maybe we&#x27;ll see what um this guy says not  in regards to his earlier zookeeper statement not   true most zookeepers love their work and love the </p>
<p>animals a great deal he says I wondered if some of   them do like us they definitely have the ability  to destroy us that&#x27;s another instance where he&#x27;s   like he kind of concedes a bit after someone else  says something it seems like you he would be like   no they they treat us as zookeepers they don&#x27;t  you know if he said it earlier but he like just   concedes with he says he&#x27;s wondered if some of  them do like us so that one kind of stood out a   little bit um do you think they&#x27;re playing some </p>
<p>role in stopping Rogue entities and D dangers   from space hurting us on a large scale he says  that was another theory yes we think they are   more interested in keeping the planet safe from  us two main suggestions are that we don&#x27;t spoil   the planet before they arrive and take it from  us or they&#x27;re letting us evolve and grow while   preventing Devastation um this is what do you  know about this claim it&#x27;s in reference to someone   who claimed uh someone saw the the construction </p>
<p>facility through remote viewing um he says sadly   not enough to give you a good response remote  viewing is a very strange thing it&#x27;s shown to   work at times but most of the time it doesn&#x27;t  or the conclusions have fuzzy connections as if   forced as for the interdimensional aspect of  it I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s anything actually   interdimensionally happening it&#x27;s just our  best way to try and grasp or perceive what&#x27;s   going on behind the veil from what I understand </p>
<p>whatevers behind the phenomenon has the ability to   manipulate matter energy in similar ways that we  can manipulate information um it also seems to be   able to play around with SpaceTime almost as if we  sitting on or perceiving time that&#x27;s been homogene   homogeneously transformed while they are free to  move about homogeneous space um if they haven&#x27;t   entered the projection space then they could  freely move about our space without interacting   with it until they collapse their coordinates </p>
<p>into our projective space and normalizing their   position with their homogeneous coordinates can&#x27;t  quite visualize that but that&#x27;s a way it&#x27;s why I   saying you don&#x27;t hear them maybe or they kind  of move um okay what materials are these UFOs   made of no one&#x27;s asked that yet that answer gets  complicated quickly short answer is an alloy that   we cannot reproduce but only repurpose this alloy  is kind of like a film that fits over the frame of   The Craft I mentioned they were built a spec um </p>
<p>the actual frame itself is heavier and composed   of more elements both of these Alloys have a lot  of elements we cannot reproduce one of the main   problems when repurposing these is getting them  hot enough they absorb heat very well and shaping   the metal is a tedious process um can you walk  through the process of identifying the contents   of a crashed UFO craft the first team arrives  that deals with occupants and initial Discovery   we arrive and meet with an external member of the </p>
<p>team who can touch and examine parts we are not   allowed to interact with we have we never have to  cut our way into the UFO we enter the first order   of business is checking for element 115 then  leaving the ship together to send it away we   return and look for any tools and loose objects  that can be extracted we then start to strip any   specialized components on board such as sensory  equipment or navigation we leave and a third and   fourth team arrive likely to remove the bulk of </p>
<p>The Craft so I don&#x27;t know I mean he&#x27;s talking   about this like it&#x27;s so common you know like he&#x27;s  doing these retrievals all the time but I don&#x27;t   know who like who&#x27;s reporting these like they  just his agency can detect them somehow and get   there before anyone reports it they just silence  whoever reported it I mean there definitely are   reports of like the Roswell ones the most famous  and stuff like that but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re   hearing all these reports have down UFOs all </p>
<p>the time you know it&#x27;s more sites not not like   reports of crashed ones so that I don&#x27;t that&#x27;s  where kind of lost me on that or I would like to   know more on what how he would answer that um are  there no other things making UFOs yes UFOs arrive   and depart Earth but very infrequently those are  usually quite large the US has been itching to   get its hands on a frighter UFO when inbound  or outbound but the chance has never presented   itself leadership openly stated securing one would </p>
<p>result in promotion the only ones they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve   uh captured are the ones this facility produced  they&#x27;ve never uh captured one that comes from   space that makes sense for the ones like in the  military videos but what about the saucers with   multicolored lights I highly doubt those are  drones or military except for the triangle um   never seen a triangle UFO lights are usually on  bigger vessels and are sensory in nature they&#x27;re   also used to spot each other I don&#x27;t know where </p>
<p>the saucer with multicolored lights report comes   from this guy says people you wouldn&#x27;t trust to  work on your car engine claiming they they are   the go-to guy for examining UFOs this seems very  unlikely he says I&#x27;m not here to convince anyone   you&#x27;ll notice yourself coming back to things  I&#x27;ve said over time on your own as understanding   increases so to see if what starts to pan out  come back to this circle back in 10 years Circle   back on the right track uh he says pay attention </p>
<p>to the space force we were told this would be a   long project disin a long disinformation this  would be a long project disinformation was one   of the key takeaways new management was hellbent  on going back to secrecy they thought we were way   too open with our operation what regards they were  being open the Zookeeper analogy is strange agree   with another here that most zookeepers like their  jobs and care about the animals they display high   levels of empathy um he says some of the tools </p>
<p>designed for eduction would make you rethink this   a lot of them cause pain or harm a common tool  we find is one that seems to scramble coherent   thoughts and make the subject childlike the best  way I can describe its use is like forcing a   stroke without actually having one it makes you  delirious but also childlike for a few hours so   that one&#x27;s interesting because there is I forget  what country but there is some report of a UFO   encounter where one person or multiple people had </p>
<p>this has happened to them which you know does that   mean this guy is telling the truth or he just is  well versed on all everything that&#x27;s out there   and kind of has combined all that into this into  what he&#x27;s writing here so it could go either way   are these beings incapable of empathy do they  have emotions I assume they must have learned   something from the recovered bodies he says never  interacted with them only heard information passed   along they can be upset though with previously </p>
<p>mentioned topics they definitely have emotion   are they from offworld and true ETS he says the  US and Leadership were adamant they were offworld   um if the Air Force is confused like you say  why is it the only agency we know of that is   not cooperating with Congress in the AO I think  is some investigation agency into this um he says   you might get a laugh out of this the Air Force  is kept in the dark we operated above them a   close coworker wondered if even the president knew </p>
<p>namely Trump because we both thought he would just   tell everyone so I guess they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re  speculating he did not know if he did he would   tell everyone from what I&#x27;ve seen most I don&#x27;t  know there&#x27;s claims like some certain presidents   knew more than others they wouldn&#x27;t tell Clinton  anything even though he asked maybe because he   asked that they wouldn&#x27;t tell him anything I  don&#x27;t know that part&#x27;s interesting Jimmy Carter   was a Believer wasn&#x27;t he he just died the rumors </p>
<p>are he&#x27; like broke down crying after they&#x27;re the   briefing on it for whatever reason interesting  to look into was it rean who inquired with must   have been the Soviets what if we could all work  together for an alien invasion or something oh   yeah maybe I have that wrong um get the Highlights  here this guy says uh what do you know about these   operation Fishbowl I don&#x27;t know what that is  he says nothing uh varinia crash which was a   a more famous reported crash in Brazil um </p>
<p>he says nothing Roswell crash he says they   were accurate on some things the material could  have been internal components or small pieces of   the alloy around the craft the Alloys I saw look  different from those pictures operation moondust   he says rumors only which I don&#x27;t know what that  is can&#x27;t help um um did you hear anything related   to a US secret space program um Gary McKinnon  claimed to see files describing offworld personal   personnel and ship names that did not exist </p>
<p>says yes the US wants to be able to leave the   solar system with their craft and explore they  were working tongue and cheek with the Russians   before I left I&#x27;m sure the invasion of Ukraine put  a stop to that rather quickly as they&#x27;re talking   about their reverse engineering they want to get  one of these reverse engineered to take take it   out for a spin see what&#x27;s out there um do all  nations coordinate their effort studying this   Bermuda Triangle Factory or is each doing their </p>
<p>own thing each of them do their own thing us is   pretty greedy with what it finds we will usually  extract information but never offer any in return   that sounds about right intelligence standpoint  yeah I could see that lind&#x27;s little more   credibility um what is the mining tool China has  that China has supposedly reverse engineered what   is that capable of hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t  seen it basically it extracts minerals via light   or beam directly out of the rock it has the </p>
<p>ability to fill the rock to some degree China was   able to figure out how it works and make a similar  version the problem with the one they built is it   only operates for a few seconds before it runs out  of power they still don&#x27;t understand Element 115   it also exploded one time and they had to remake  it so I don&#x27;t know how he would know all that but   again it&#x27;s interesting kind of weird specifics  got to quite the imagination or telling the truth   are are the m to spec craft you describe just the </p>
<p>metall looking spheres observed and brought up in   the latest hearings seems to be lots of orbs discs  and Tic Tacs yes this is exactly why they always   look so different things like triangles and hard  hard edged squares don&#x27;t exist though pill shapes   are extremely sought after and some we think are  fr Raiders that&#x27;s the one like David fraver report   saw that guy he was on Rogan and Lex fredman the  2004 incident was famous one of the famous Tic Tac   sightings so apparently they&#x27;ve never recovered </p>
<p>one of those according to this guy um not a Hu   this guy says it&#x27;s not a huge variety that you&#x27;d  expect from a ma to spec craft regarding their   shapes he says the best analogy I can give you  for the variety is is think of it like wrapping   food in tin foil on a plate it&#x27;s a bad analogy but  you get the idea usually they will always be round   or oval sometimes even pill-shaped the tin foil  fits the intended function of covering everything   without squishing it so it&#x27;s just like built to </p>
<p>what it needs and then protective wrap is put on   it um uh do they just not like humans and like  the planet what&#x27;s to stop them from just coing a   all they could absolutely destroy us if they  wanted to it&#x27;s kind of scary they have started   launch sequences before that we suspect were tests  on what they are dealing with oh how he would know   that my personal view is they have to stay out  of our way but keep us from destroying ourselves   I imagine life elsewhere in the universe often </p>
<p>destroys itself uh but yeah why don&#x27;t know why   they would care about us destroying ourselves  almost that would almost if they&#x27;re here to   inhabit it that would almost take their work  away they just let us destroy ourselves and   they just come a lot less people to deal with uh  do you think we will get more answers from the   government disclosure as in them telling us aliens  exist or will the cover up continue at one point   they briefed us about opening up information about </p>
<p>the craft but not the construction unit nothing   happened for months new leadership shows up  Suddenly It&#x27;s back to [ __ ] and secrets again so   freaking new leadership and management doesn&#x27;t uh  Drive in uh as to the Air Force they must have had   images and video of these things pretty close up  you&#x27;d think they would be the agency with the most   knowledge of the subject he says Air Force goal is  to fight other countries they have footage but is   mostly discovered and recorded by sheer chance the </p>
<p>space force however will be an entirely new thing   their focus is similar to ours with a Sprinkle  of disinformation um regarding materials do we   produce it or is it collected from other craft and  just recycled because that seems to be the case   I think in trying to engineer these things um  we tried to produce it and failed we produced   we produce a shitty variant of it and use it for  certain parts we build most of what we use for   things that cannot be replaced is recycled our </p>
<p>ability to rehash um what they have has gotten   better slowly um is there Tech that was gained  from these craft that the military widely uses   today or civilians for that matter says a lot of  your stealth aircraft sport smoother designs for   one learning to track them also helped with  targeting software Laser Technology comes to   mind since it&#x27;s a crippled version of what they  use most of what I saw was way above us it&#x27;s hard   to put the Hammers and how you see through them </p>
<p>into words it&#x27;s not like a drone camera and it&#x27;s   not a clear image to us at least uh can you  clarify they have a distinct fascination with   radiation remember how I mentioned they don&#x27;t go  far from home base when Fukushima happened the   construction facility deployed multiple UFOs to  the location over multiple weeks they were also   very interested in Ebola at one point we can&#x27;t  confirm abduction since the local population is   uh you get it you get the idea no one cared was </p>
<p>that African thing Ebola uh that what he saying   no one cares about Afric I think it probably  Ebola 10 years ago um according to Lou elzando   he was kind of one of those David grush type guys  like a guy who was government and then suddenly   came out as a supposed whistleblower um with a  lot of information but this guy says according   to alzando Italians seem to have a good grasp  on the phenomenon including that they originate   somewhere from the Mediterranean is it possible </p>
<p>there&#x27;s another Factory there he says starting   this thread and starting this thread and seeing  everyone mention the Arctic has me wondering if   there were others it would make sense with other  sit writings since as mentioned previously far   from home is rare so that&#x27;s another one where  like why why wouldn&#x27;t he have known that like   why are these commenters influencing what he knows  in any way seems like he would he would know so   much more than anyone else could possibly know </p>
<p>but does the moon hold anything of Interest no   no that not that I&#x27;m aware of we know that UFOs  entering and exiting the atmosphere did not go   towards any known planet often do you think  that they interfere with our general science   or investigations says yes they do not want to  be studied they also do not collect down craft   or occupants it seems to be an O well approach  Element 115 is the exception they don&#x27;t seem   to enjoy the idea of us toying with it is the </p>
<p>technology they reproduce increasing rapidly or   lags for years I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an increase  in technology it&#x27;s more like adjustments better   understanding of how to operate it&#x27;s was it&#x27;s one  reason we thought about 100 years for the first   deployment of the construction facility if it were  here for years we would have seen the majority of   all adjustments made so I guess that&#x27;s what the  kind of the question I asked earlier so that&#x27;s why   he&#x27;s saying they were piloted and now they&#x27;re not </p>
<p>because it&#x27;s just so recent that they&#x27;ve had to   learn how they&#x27;re doing better on the Fly um does  the construction facility produce any signature   heat electromagnetic how do you track it says  both we rely mostly on detecting the gravity it   produces it normally doesn&#x27;t produce heat outright  when it does we believe it&#x27;s in the process of   construction since a small heat buildup can be  detected when a craft returns or exits we think   this happens when it&#x27;s being broken back down into </p>
<p>parts or assembled we can only detect these heat   signatures when it&#x27;s near the surface of the ocean  so sometimes the UFO will pop out on us how do you   know about other Count&#x27;s efforts we don&#x27;t obtain  that Direct ly it&#x27;s passed along to us I guess   would be the typical way we get anything such as  spying or bribery um my department sits above the   Air Force for UFO recovery and information in  the same way the US Air Force sits above me on   Military plans for Ukraine alternatively do other </p>
<p>countries Know About Us efforts Russia and China   yes others it depends on the level of information  some governments still don&#x27;t know aliens even   exist or aren&#x27;t sure how do we know you aren&#x27;t  some FBI agent or other glowy there&#x27;s no way for   me to prove that to you you should always be  asking though all I can say is pay attention   to things as time progresses and you&#x27;ll be able  to look back and see I was right so again he says   just whatever believe me or not but you&#x27;re going </p>
<p>to be coming back to this so the symbols that   you saw did they remind you of any other symbols  you&#x27;ve seen on Earth no just what I mentioned how   many craft do we have at the moment I don&#x27;t don&#x27;t  know I can tell you I&#x27;ve seen about 18 different   models pass through for testing and research  he described some of the other tools found on   wrecked craft we have found things as simple as  basic tools I can to tweezers to the lab one that   sticks out to me was an oval-shaped silver ball </p>
<p>that would change colors based on how close it   was to a source of energy another would be a sheet  of metal that allowed you to view Bones by placing   it nears someone&#x27;s hand that would be cool just  like a instant x-ray yeah yeah type thing um can   you describe any injuries or deaths that occurred  involving an alien craft I&#x27;ve witness no deaths or   injuries aside from corpses I never got to see  one we had with an abductee we had one with an   abductee but they weren&#x27;t sure at the time if she </p>
<p>died on him are they going to invade Humanity in   Mass sounds like they have sounds like that you&#x27;re  living it he says I think wiping us out would be   easy for them currently no idea why they would  wait so I guess he&#x27;s saying they don&#x27;t want to   cuz if they did they just would have already  um what do you know about Element 115 what I   described above has its own field of gravity but  is weak on its own is it really a stable isotope   of the element with atomic number 115 yes I&#x27;m </p>
<p>no expert in that field though we are given the   basics how would you go about interacting with  it you can hold it removal is done very gently   though where is it found in the craft compartment  near the gravity engine usually not far from the   center of the craft if the craft has a frame with  a centerpiece we have to extract it from an angle   this guy says fake how can element be anti-grav  it would fly to space and you couldn&#x27;t find it   so he says maybe my explanation was bad but I </p>
<p>feel like it&#x27;s just your reading comprehension   yeah has a point I could see he&#x27;s not bound  by the laws of gravity it just flies out fake   which it&#x27;s just a funny response that&#x27;s hilarious  fake and he says it IM it it emits a weak field   of gravity it doesn&#x27;t float float away or hover if  Earth is round how&#x27;s come the people on the bottom   don&#x27;t fall off yeah okay why would they allow  you to investigate them he says I think they just   cut their losses we don&#x27;t get much opportunity </p>
<p>otherwise they just don&#x27;t care about the crap   couldn&#x27;t it be on purpose to see how much you  can discover he says just looking at the way   they operate I doubt it and isn&#x27;t a question  isn&#x27;t it dangerous that the Chinese have this   Tech uh the US is quite upset over it they  won&#x27;t trade either because they know we will   trade in bad faith so they aren&#x27;t exactly  wrong so he says China is pretty Advanced   on engineering this stuff and they won&#x27;t key </p>
<p>us into it because they know we wouldn&#x27;t share   our stuff with them um are all are all models  powered by Element 115 every model I&#x27;ve seen   operates this way I&#x27;ve always wanted to see  inside the construction unit for this reason   alone um what about the Zimbabwe incident where  a craft with Grays landed in Ru Zimbabwe that&#x27;s   the one famous one where it landed in a a school  like Elementary Schoo yard tons of reports on that   it&#x27;s way too much to get into he says it doesn&#x27;t </p>
<p>seem likely but here&#x27;s the kicker based on what   they described I believe them minus a few things  they said out of curiosity do you know any direct   contact of Agents by them never heard of direct  contact started from their end that doesn&#x27;t mean   we haven&#x27;t um I&#x27;ll never understand this the  current implementation of compartmentalization   and complete secrecy is a Fool&#x27;s errand uh he  says one of the minor Reasons I&#x27;m here we agree   I do think the initial panic would be really bad </p>
<p>especially for religious community that&#x27;s kind   of something you or just panic in general people  always say well they can&#x27;t just come come out and   say everything they know because it would cause  mass panic which I guess depending on what they   know may be I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be like mass panic  I mean they&#x27;ve already they&#x27;ve already I mean the   pentagon&#x27;s already disclosed some things you know  whether you just think that&#x27;s some disinformation   agenda or whatever but people are going to think </p>
<p>that if they just come out and say whatever like   what are they what&#x27;s their angle you know  why are they making this up you know so I   don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know um okay here&#x27;s some bigger  text uh you are making stuff up he just says   okay says okay that&#x27;s what you think um you&#x27;ve  mentioned that they get upset At The Mention   Of War and conflict he says extremely upset if  the threat is believable like war with country   Etc um okay question allegedly certain Army </p>
<p>Personnel who had close encounters with uaps   would have sudden shifts in emotion or would  complain of headaches a few of these people died   shortly after coming into contact when examined  doctors would find evidence of radiation targeting   specific areas of the brain Gary Nolan thinks  this is what Havana syndrome actually is was it   says Havana syndrome isn&#x27;t also known as this is  from the AI overview anomalous Health incidence is   a rare and disputed medical condition that causes </p>
<p>mysterious symptoms in US government officials and   their families what go okay could be um question  I&#x27;ve seen a few True Believers theorize that if   aliens understood understood human physiology  far better than we do they could influence the   brain with some sort of Technology we don&#x27;t really  understand of course this would have far reaching   implications about the human brain mind control  Etc he says I can&#x27;t speak to that area much as I   pre as I said previously the tools aren&#x27;t friendly </p>
<p>ones they would serve a better purpose okay they   would serve a better purpose wrangling tards  than in ensuring a patient is content so have   to remember some of this I think it&#x27;s coming up  soon remember some of the vocabulary this guy&#x27;s   used I have something I noticed I&#x27;ll talk about  here um I have had a white I have had a white orb   physically interact with me once he says nothing  comes to mind for that other than the Hammers um   you can&#x27;t relay Voice or thoughts through them </p>
<p>so I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s kind of calling BS on that   guy&#x27;s white orb or saying it&#x27;s not what he&#x27;s  studied at least question twice I&#x27;ve seen UFOs   within hours of experiencing World shattering  catastrophic catastrophic trauma are the two   related or is this just a massive coincidence um  he just says they have regulars for abduction we   never observed any repeated stops related to  that though um has there been any discussion   internally about the origins of these beings and </p>
<p>the facility he says only amongst ourselves since   we see the direction they enter leave the solar  system briefly the higher ups definitely know   definitely know it just wasn&#x27;t part of what  we did once it leaves the planet ignore it   um I&#x27;m guessing that the biology department has  little to no communication with yours he says I   wouldn&#x27;t know they exist if I didn&#x27;t see them  we get a basic rundown the higher ups give us   if we send information forward it is always passed </p>
<p>along um any idea what happens to the ships planes   people that construction unit disappears uh yeah  you already answered that destroyed near instantly   with no suffering so that&#x27;s good doesn&#x27;t torture  him um can you try to draw some symbols for us   put him putting him to the test um oh I can&#x27;t  remember anything specific if I&#x27;m being honest it   all looks the same to it&#x27;s kind of racist H does  the language look linear like ours yes but there   are soft corners and things like dots but not many </p>
<p>guess there&#x27;s some specifics for it um what about   SpaceTime manipulation any hunches there never  heard any is pitched other than the engineers   gravity causing time dilation um this guy says  You&#x27;re contradicting actual data we have on uaps   and also acting like uh you have access to all  compartmentalized Departments of Dia um he says if   it provides any context I knew a lot less until I  managed the team the last few years you should be   skeptical um then he hops off for a bit so I think </p>
<p>that&#x27;s the first time he mentioned that he managed   maning actually managing the team at some point so  that was interesting now this guy was responding   to that other guy he says what are you talking  about what actual data do we have on UAP and then   this guy says I&#x27;m not surprised some people think  this way there&#x27;s a ton of shrouded information on   the topic says I think debunkers are necessary  though they aren&#x27;t wrong this community should   be skeptical if the US a if the US Navy Etc knows </p>
<p>where the construction facility is is just what   he highlighted um he says they don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t  know the Navy does um this guy says a lot of Bob   Lazar is proven BS he&#x27;s ask for a source on yeah  that was interesting cuz he&#x27;s not uh Lazar isn&#x27;t   like this really heralded guy by most people  within the UFO you know it&#x27;s not there&#x27;s a lot   of dis or debate and distrust of him so it&#x27;s  I guess it&#x27;s also weird if he was you know if   he just knows all this why he would choose Lazar </p>
<p>to back up with these claims you know although I   don&#x27;t know who else you but it seemed like yeah  I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s just kind of weird like if he   is just making it up based on everything he knows  if he knew that much about UFOs you would think   he would know that a lot of people don&#x27;t trust  Lazar and wouldn&#x27;t mention him yeah that&#x27;s why   I think it&#x27;s just Bob yeah just him yeah I  haven&#x27;t heard that might be on to something   uh what does the interior of the craft look like </p>
<p>please describe NBA players that that get burner   accounts on Twitter whatever yeah just so obvious  number 32 isn&#x27;t getting the ball enough yeah man   he&#x27;d go off just needs time to show everyone what  he can do I would buy out the entire Arena myself   if we could have a game where only 32 shot the  ball or uh remember the Patrick Reid&#x27;s wife had   the burner account oh no would like always post  stuff defending Patrick Reed which was especially   obvious because who would defend Patrick Reed </p>
<p>yeah lot of Bob lazar&#x27;s proven [ __ ] no it&#x27;s   not he&#x27;s actually a really cool guy I from what  I&#x27;ve heard from what I&#x27;ve heard okay what does the   interior of the craft look like please describe  in detail um he says it&#x27;s always cramped and   hard to stand fully upright in for reference I&#x27;m  5&#x27;8 that&#x27;s probably not that&#x27;s probably I mean   if there&#x27;s any truth to this if he&#x27;s actually  whistleblowing I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t use his own   height so this could be something yeah I&#x27;m sure </p>
<p>he&#x27;s not actually 58 if he&#x27;s telling the truth um   there&#x27;s almost never a storage facility in the  craft unless it&#x27;s dedicated to something for   the craft there&#x27;s always a method of interacting  with the craft tools are not freely placed around   the craft and have dedicated placement just  a crescent wrench laying on the ground some   H yes just a scattering tools random screwdriver  just not organiz never know what we&#x27;re going to   need down there let&#x27;s take it all uh comment it </p>
<p>sounds like the Tic Tacs or cigar-shaped ones   are transports nobody has gotten a hold of right  cigar shaped are very rare correct we were told   finding one would be career changing we suspect  they are transports But ultimately don&#x27;t know some   kind of reward system if you can be the one or I  don&#x27;t know what he means career who like who is   finding these like does that imply like someone  in his position like he can find them and then   well that&#x27;s what it seems like rewarded for so I </p>
<p>yeah I don&#x27;t know how that would or like career   changing for your unit like if you&#x27;re unit find  one within you know for your division within the   broader program or something so that&#x27;s somewhat  odd comment to make um yeah I don&#x27;t know where   they find them cuz they are all retri I I don&#x27;t  think anyone ever asked that cuz I don&#x27;t remember   I mean we&#x27;re almost through it now they asked  like yeah who tips them off but that would be one   of the main questions I would think um what role </p>
<p>do you think space force will play in disclosure   moving forward um it says openly stated to us  Discovery for internal use and disinformation to   the public which I don&#x27;t even know what the what  space force claims its purpose is but um what can   we do as a populist to encourage uh your bosses to  lighten up he says this has always been on my mind   I think if we convinced another Nation like China  or Russia to come out the us would have to come   out as well I think having the Air Force release </p>
<p>their footage was a way to jump start SpaceX in a   way uh the Pentagon has already reported that  the legit uaps are offworld Vehicles not made   on this Earth while you&#x27;re claiming they are  made in a facility in the he says I stayed mult   times we&#x27;ve seen them come and go from the planet  we suspect the construction facility is capable   of space travel as well the facility itself can is  it craft travel too I guess why couldn&#x27;t it if it   can do all this other stuff that seemed trivial </p>
<p>um comment people with security clearances that   large don&#x27;t just get on forchan to Spill the Beans  he says you&#x27;re not wrong and if it makes you feel   better watching my internet take a [ __ ] last  night made me panic a bit like his internet went   out or something say made him Panic a bit if I&#x27;m  being honest I could have just ignored your post   too I feel like the expression if I&#x27;m being honest  if I&#x27;m being honest he&#x27;s used that a number of   times honestly telling on himself a bit um comment </p>
<p>providing zero evidence towards his claim also the   burden of proof fallacy says was I supposed to  steal data from work and post it freely here how   about a copy of my clearance or work work badge  yes aan let me just out myself completely so he&#x27;s   saying tell you all that stuff any info about the  crop circles that&#x27;s a whole different subject says   never seen one or heard of it being relevant U has  there been any unusual effects on the environment   Wildlife no but they do study animals guy says </p>
<p>why was 2002 a big year so this was an interesting   answer because he says a lot of activities and  changes in operation both for them and us a lot   of secret secrecy issues surfaced that year as  a result funding also jumped through the roof   so I can kind of take this as um he&#x27;s saying that  sounds like he was working there in 2002 because   he says we and whatever how he describes that and  then I guess maybe I didn&#x27;t mention it earlier but   in one of these answers he talks about how they </p>
<p>uh how they recruit and he says like you have to   have a really clear uh background and whatever  and he&#x27;s he says he&#x27;s never seen anyone under   35 so if you if you take that and if he was  working there in 2002 and was at least 35 then   and probably 40 at Le you know if he&#x27;s never seen  anyone so that would mean he&#x27;s like 60 in his 60s   now and from a lot of the way he&#x27;s wording things  and and stuff and I guess just being on 4chan in   general it doesn&#x27;t seem like something as someone </p>
<p>in their 60s would do the way he&#x27;s talking yeah I   haven&#x27;t really seen that mentioned anywhere and  overviews or critiques of this um and he could   just be talking I mean whatever he could just say  we like the talking about the department before he   was there if he&#x27;s talking about 2002 but that  was just one interesting thing that stood out   it sounds like he&#x27;s saying and if you know how  would he know if it&#x27;s so secret then how would   he know if he wasn&#x27;t there how would he know it </p>
<p>was such a big year yeah no I that sounds like he   was working so I feel like the that guy who always  he&#x27;s in the CIA or whatever who always comes on   Rogan and he refers to it as the agency Michael  Baker yeah his kids are Sluggo and slug rocker   Rocky and slugo or something rock slugo yeah the  agency never leave the CIA call them xcia but yeah   that&#x27;s no such thing okay I think basically on  the last few here um is this job stressful uh   very strained my marriage greatly uh what kind </p>
<p>of training qualifications are needed to work in   this field record needs to be clean as possible  education can vary uh do you listen to public   sightings or go off your own agency&#x27;s Intel says  agent Intel all the way nearly all of it is passed   verbally in person um how does the government  prevent or respond to potential National Security   threats posed by UFOs come and going in out of the  atmosphere or ocean um he says wait for crashes   the only time everyone is all hands on deck is </p>
<p>if they screw with nukes we mostly just watch   and wait for them to [ __ ] up so I don&#x27;t I guess  the says we mostly watch so maybe they do have I   don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s saying they have some sort of  monitoring device that can detect the crashes or   what um this guy says if you&#x27;re dying why can&#x27;t  you just tell us the department name and share   some photos of documents he says I&#x27;d like to  appreciate what little life I have left uh so   I guess he thinks that would cause him trouble </p>
<p>um do you know where in space they come from any   star system in particular again and higher-ups  knew I never did he&#x27;s gone to that quite a few   times an answer for something he doesn&#x27;t want to I  don&#x27;t know why that would be that secret you know   if someone knows but he wouldn&#x27;t he just never  asked um I might have got him in trouble yeah   don&#x27;t career suicide um any craft found on Earth  that was ancient he says none that I saw comment   plasma physics has developed greatly in the past </p>
<p>few decades he says you should be a p you should   be pay paying attention to things like this long  after I leave Laser Technology too and that&#x27;s it   I went over most of them he says taking a break  until later this evening um as I mentioned weekend   is busy if the thread dies I&#x27;ll attempt to do he  actually did do I don&#x27;t know I think this is the   same guy but I&#x27;m not going to go into all that  I think we covered plenty of it um but there are   some posts from a couple weeks later that might be </p>
<p>the same guy but it&#x27;s a lot of the same stuff so   yeah I don&#x27;t know guy with a got a create cretive  creative guy on our hands or a very important guy   on our hands yeah my takeaway with these is that I  I don&#x27;t understand how they couldn&#x27;t Trace I mean   they it seems like they can do so much stuff like  if he was really what he was saying was really a   threat yeah you know I don&#x27;t know why spilling  all this truth yeah so yeah it could be there&#x27;s   different options if it&#x27;s just whatever just an </p>
<p>completely made up normal guy who&#x27;s really into   the topic wanted to have fun you know that&#x27;s an  option um it could be a guy in a similar role to   what he&#x27;s describing but this is all like I said  with some other things you know possibly a lot   of Truth in it but also just things thrown in to  completely throw off the story you know it could   be that I don&#x27;t know how likely I mean obviously  probably the most likely whatever making it up or   writing yeah I mean guess we&#x27;ll wait and see keep </p>
<p>coming back to it as more stuff emerges yeah the   other thing I don&#x27;t understand and I we touched  on a little bit was what they&#x27;re doing to prevent   any sort of nuclear I&#x27;ve heard that before but I  haven&#x27;t really quite understood like just because   you&#x27;re going to fly your craft above and so is  the gold what is their goal like somebody will   see it be like oh there&#x27;s aliens maybe maybe we  should reports multile reports of them disabling   the nukes so I guess I look into that more to know </p>
<p>exactly what to mention but yeah I don&#x27;t know some   like just general intimidation like we can shut  these down you know we&#x27;re here whatever I but so   like the people who I guess it&#x27;s the people in the  know who are like these things keep flying above   our stuff and they&#x27;ve proven that they can do that  yeah want to tell Russia that they&#x27;re shutting   your stuff down I don&#x27;t know yeah well presumably  they would be doing the same thing over Russia   I mean yeah You&#x27; think and then they wouldn&#x27;t </p>
<p>want to tell us yeah right I can&#x27;t figure you   know I don&#x27;t know a reason that military people  would make up those reports so all that stuff&#x27;s   like what a lot of it seems credible just don&#x27;t  know how to how to categorize it or understand it   yet also it seems like too if they if they care  about us have yeah I don&#x27;t know I mean I guess   if they just have an interest in us and want us  to be a lot like not blow the planet up or blow   ourselves up that&#x27;s one thing but if then he was </p>
<p>mentioning abductions and some of the stuff like   The psychosis and things that they&#x27;ll induce  on people so if they were real compassionate   about the human race I wouldn&#x27;t think they would  doing that I mean maybe outside of just studying   somebody but they could do that I would think  and induce that childlike Behavior whatever he   was mentioning purposefully induced or some side  effect something there&#x27;s all kinds of well I guess   cattle mutilation reports you ever seen those yeah </p>
<p>you said they studied well whatever is doing this   to the cattle like all the blood&#x27;s gone there&#x27;s  no there&#x27;s no blood under the animal like it&#x27;s the   blood was taken somewhere else and then the animal  was placed there they say like scavengers always   stay away from these cattle where normally a dead  cow would be decimate you know eating to the Bone   it&#x27;s like weird like skin around the mouth is like  removed the genitals are removed like all with   Precision accuracy yeah I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a whole </p>
<p>another topic can&#x27;t get can&#x27;t get into all yeah   I haven&#x27;t really looked into that thing yeah yeah  this uh yeah I don&#x27;t know my gut would be that he   I don&#x27;t know it seems like it would where it&#x27;s  just somebody having yeah yeah having fun with   it online I just don&#x27;t think well like you said I  guess if you piece together his age and then some   of the way he was wording stuff he just nothing  he said sounded like he would be somebody high   up and this managing people in a and Association </p>
<p>after someone how do you how would you know all   of this and he&#x27;s like well actually I managed the  team my last few years so I didn&#x27;t I didn&#x27;t know   until then yeah there&#x27;s I think there&#x27;s enough  kind of examples that don&#x27;t quite yeah I think   you can pretty confidently say it&#x27;s not what he  claims it is you know whether he&#x27;s in some similar   position and I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s just a fun makes  you think it&#x27;s fun it&#x27;s fun kind there being a   spaceship manufacturing thing even if it is made </p>
<p>up he kind of summarized in a way a lot of like   what is out there or all the lore that&#x27;s currently  out there which you would want to do if you don&#x27;t   you know you can&#x27;t go make up something that  is going to contradict everything that&#x27;s out   there because people be like well there&#x27;s all  these reports that don&#x27;t men you know there&#x27;s   no reports of what you&#x27;re describing they all  describe this other thing believe in yeah yeah   I don&#x27;t think I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t really get like </p>
<p>the people who say oh like why does no one care   about what&#x27;s going on or like what like I don&#x27;t  know I don&#x27;t think people should care about it   like you can&#x27;t do anything about it it&#x27;s hard to  filter what&#x27;s going on it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t affect   anything really it&#x27;s like whatever well that&#x27;s  just the thing you never there&#x27;s so much stuff   out there and some of it&#x27;s like yeah I mean it&#x27;s  interesting it&#x27;s fun to talk about but yeah I&#x27;m   not I don&#x27;t spend all day researching it somehow </p>
<p>being confirmed officially I don&#x27;t think really   changes just like a new thing like unlike you  said people will be yeah it whatever we adapt to   whatever info we&#x27;re presented with it just becomes  normalized right away it&#x27;s like it would be it   would be similar to like if you were born and we  had no knowledge that we were in a solar system   you know like there&#x27;s other planets and then one  day you wake up and they&#x27;re like hey we found some   of these other planets are rotating around you </p>
<p>know what oh wow that completely changes the way   I thought things work but you know whatever so  versus now we don&#x27;t even think about it because   that&#x27;s just how was but poor analogy but so I it&#x27;s  just a new thing just get used to it new thing</p>
