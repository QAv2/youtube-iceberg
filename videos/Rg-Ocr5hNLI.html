            <p>this episode of the wi files is brought to you by delete [Music] me the history of medicine goes back to the dawn of mankind when ancient healers used special herbs to treat illnesses hypocrates the father of medicine laid the foundation for modern Medical Practice observ ation diagnosis prognosis and treatment his work set the stage for centuries of medical progress in the 19th century Edward Jenner created a smallpox vaccine and Louis Pastor proved microorganisms cause disease the 20th century brought antibiotics Medical Imaging and organ transplants in the past 400 years the human lifespan has doubled but something happened to Medicine along the way it became an industry a profitable one President Eisenhower warned against creating a military industrial complex because if you make war profitable you&#x27;ll always have war and he was right the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist so here&#x27;s a cynical question if you make illness profitable will you always have illness well in recent years trillions have been spent on cancer research and therapies now that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a lot of people getting rich from a disease that&#x27;s already been [Music] cured Alas poor uck I knew him Horatio yeah human thank goodness you&#x27;re here it&#x27;s an emergency I told you baby I didn&#x27;t know I swear to Poseidon

to work I don&#x27;t even know what a semi aquatic picture is I was a model I started doing a semi- aquatic you know I still kept some of my scales covered but I hit a rut and bills were piling up and I didn&#x27;t know what to do so I ended up toing do doing what I did full waterless Royal Raymond R was born in Nebraska in 1888 he was a good student and wanted to be a doctor only 16 years old he was admitted to John&#x27;s Hopkins University one of the best medical institutions in the world re became fascinated by bacteriology and the microscopic World which led him to Optics to study bacteria effectively he needed to see them clearly he took aob job at Zeiss Works in New York and trained under senior Optics Engineers if you know anything about microscopes telescopes or cameras or anything with lenses you&#x27;ve heard of Zeiss and R wasn&#x27;t a bookworm researcher he was Hands-On he built his own equipment including one of the most powerful microscopes ever made the universal microscope in the 1920s standard microscopes could only magnify objects up to 2,000 times r reached 60,000 times magnification he could see viruses and bacteria that nobody had ever seen before R discovered what he called basilis X or the BX virus he believed cancer wasn&#x27;t a disease it was a virus the BX virus he wanted to destroy these microorganisms without harming surrounding tissue then he made another amazing Discovery he found that exposing microorganisms to specific frequencies cause them to explode it&#x27;s immediately paralyzed and it starts toting from within all objects have a resonant frequency when exposed to an external Force matching this frequency an object absorbs energy and vibrates more intensely parts of the human body have their own frequencies this is useful in an MRI which uses frequencies to produce diagnostic images but it can also be dangerous if you resonate an object for too long or too much energy it could be damaged or destroyed this is why singers can break a glass by singing the right [Applause] note that&#x27;s how you do it so rif built the rif frequency generator or rif machine which emitted specific frequencies to Target and Destroy specific microorganisms he called the frequency the Mortal oscillatory rate he found the frequencies to destroy tuberculosis typhoid pneumonia Anthrax and more all without harming healthy tissue now you can see the disintegration of the bacteria play in the pieces this is killing bacteria without arm to the image itself without drugs he injected Lab Rats with cancer cells creating golf ball-sized tumors then used his machine to match the canc Cancer&#x27;s mortal oscillatory rate it worked the Lab Rats were completely cancer-free R&#x27;s work attracted interest from other doctors Dr Milbank Johnson arranged a study on 16 cancer patients using ri&#x27;s machine in 3 months 14 of the 16 patients were completely cured Dr Royal Raymond R discovered the cure for cancer and it ruined him Royal Raymond R&#x27;s Discovery was a Triumph his clinical trial in 1934 was a huge success 16 cases were treated at the clinic for many types of malignancy after 3 months 14 of these so-called hopeless cases were signed off as clinically cured by the staff of five medical doctors and Doctor Alvin G Ford ND pathologist for the group at first the medical establishment rejected ri&#x27;s ideas the notion that simple radio waves could succeed where radiation and surgery had failed well that was nonsense they figured R&#x27;s funding would dry up and he&#x27;d disappear but that didn&#x27;t happen to get financed in medical research you need support from the pharmaceutical industry but R didn&#x27;t need big Pharma he was backed by a few private investors including William timkin who owned a ball bearing company yay it&#x27;s all ball bearing nowadays okay now you uh prepare that fet of valve with some 3 in1 oil and gor pits with I&#x27;m going to need better 10 quarts of antifreeze what Fletch I know it&#x27;s Fletch with no ties to the medical industry R had the freedom to research whatever and however he wanted doctors around the country figured if this rif guy wasn&#x27;t going away they might as well look at his work R used his machine more than 400 times on animal tumors it worked every time forcing even the most hardened Skeptics to take notice and there was no bigger skeptic than Morris [Music] fishbine fishbine head of the American Medical Association was known to be very aggressive some critics called him the medical musolini at first fishbine offered to buy R out but when R said no fish Bin&#x27;s attitude changed R kept working but progress became increasingly difficult mysterious people started showing up at his lab some offered bribes and others made threats other doctors had success using R&#x27;s technology but were pressured by the AMA to stop or lose their licenses Vigilant against query is Dr Morris fishbine there is no serum drug or combination of drugs that we know that will definitely cure cancer any doctor caught using a rif machine was harassed and worse fishbine then launched a campaign of character assassination against R articles appeared in medical journals and newspapers calling r a quack and a charlatan R&#x27;s lab was vandalized his equipment destroyed and his research disappeared his life was unraveling the final blow came in 193 9 fishbine offered one of R&#x27;s investors legal assistance in an attempt to steal the company from R and other investors R spent years fighting lawsuits he went bankrupt and the AMA stopped his work from proceeding Royal Raymond R quietly retired brok and broken he turned to alcohol [Music] about 20 years later renewed interest in R&#x27;s technology LED John Crane and John Marsh to convince him to build a new machine R agreed but the business didn&#x27;t last long in 1960 their Labs were raided without a warrant all equipment and records were seized R stayed out of court but his Partners were charged with medical fraud even though 14 patients testified they were cured by the rif machine Crane and Mar Marsh were sentenced to 3 years in prison oh by the way the forom of the jury was an AMA doctor oh come on re was again labeled a liar and a quack and reduced to poverty and despair many of R&#x27;s Associates face tragedies Dr milb Johnson died in 1944 poisoned and all his research disappeared berett labs in New Jersey Building rif machines to treat cancer mysteriously burned to the ground in 1939 all equipment and research were destroyed and the owner of the lab Dr John Bernett was related to William tinkin the bull bearing guy yep Dr Elmer nemis was a nuclear physicist medical doctor and microscope designer he was trying to replicate R&#x27;s work in 1969 he died while staying at a hotel when his bed suddenly Caught Fire 2 years later in 1971 r had a heart attack well in the hospital he died after he was accidentally given a lethal dose of Valium accidentally my dorsal fin but R&#x27;s ideas didn&#x27;t die with him other Pioneers would seek out alternative ways of curing diseases the medical Mavericks were not going away but neither were Morris fishbine or the AMA the medical establishment does not like alternative medicine in the 19th century there were two types of medical practitioners in the US allopathic doctors and alternative healers allopathic doctors diagnose and treat illnesses with Pharmaceuticals surgery and other conventional methods alternative healers used natural remedies since anybody could claim to be a Healer many did natural healers were cheaper and plentiful mainstream doctors weren&#x27;t making any money so in 1847 they formed a trade Union called the American Medical Association the AMA the AMA started out as a union yep isn&#x27;t a Union&#x27;s job to protect the interests of its members it is so in 1901 the Journal of the American Medical Association released a statement the growth of the profession must be stemmed if individual members are to find the practice of medicine a lucrative profession so the amaama was created so doctors can make more money that&#x27;s right isn&#x27;t this corrupt I&#x27;m not judging I&#x27;m just telling you what happened the AMA brought in the carnegi foundation to survey medical schools in 1910 they released a report calling for standardizing Medical Training and eliminating non-scientific practices yeah and and who determines what&#x27;s scientific theama does yeah of course schools teaching alternative medicine were forced to drop these courses or lose funding and their ability to Grant an MD this led to a significant reduction in medical schools they offered tremendous amounts of money to the schools that would agree to cooperate with them almost overnight all of the major universities received large grants from these sources and also accepted one two or three of these people that I mentioned on their board of directors and the schools literally were taken over by the financial interests that put up the money in 1904 there are 160 schools granting MDS to more than 28,000 students by 1920 only 85 medical schools were left by 1935 the number had dropped to just 66 new awareness of past injustices in many parts of our society that&#x27;s true in the fields of science and medicine which are starting to look more carefully at their own history most medical schools for blacks and all medical schools for women were now closed so if you were black or a woman becoming an MD and getting into the AMA was difficult the American Medical Association is one of the country&#x27;s oldest largest and best known associations of doctors its voice has long been influential but now the AMA is finally beginning to come to turns with racism in its own past the doctor is the only one entitled by training by experience and by law to take care of the sick the AMA established alpath medicine as the only acceptable type of medicine to practice alternative medicine was marginalized and in some cases made illegal even if the natural medicine worked Yep this is bad it gets worse it always does the doctors from that point forward in history would be taught pharmace itical drugs all of the great teaching institutions in America were captured by the pharmaceutical interests in this fashion and it&#x27;s amazing how little money it really took to do it every time a new type of alternative medicine was introduced the AMA would attack George doc Simmons was head of the AMA from 1900 to 1924 and Morris fishbine from 1924 to 1949 they abled alternative practitioners as quacks and used the Journal of the American Medical Association to ruin the reputations of anyone they deemed a threat to mainstream medicine the FDA was formed in 1906 but it wasn&#x27;t until 1962 the drug companies had to prove their products worked and were safe before then pharmaceutical companies needed the AMA seal of approval didn&#x27;t how did the drugs get approved yeah I should have seen that coming if you were a drug company and wanted to get into the Journal of the AMA you had to pay that was it the AMA didn&#x27;t test drugs for safety or efficacy they had no Labs or researchers the AMA just collected money oh the AMA leaders would buy stock in that drug company before endorsing the drug you know so they can cash in when the stock price went up oh inside a trading uh like they doing Congress yeah kind of like that nice work if you can get it huh sure is Dr Max Gerson made a terrible mistake when he made the claim that smoking could cause cancer he didn&#x27;t realize that at the time the single largest contributor to the AMA was Philip Morris Morris fishbine quickly launched a campaign to imply that smoking was not only safe but was recommended by doctors yes according to this survey more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette pack after pack week after week see for yourself why camels are so popular with the doctors of America Simmons retired in 1924 as a wealthy man and then fishbine took over by the way Simmons was never a doctor he got his diploma from Rush Medical College by mail at least fishbine went to medical school though he wasn&#x27;t a good student he never finished his internship he never received received the diploma and never practiced medicine never saw a patient not ever in 1938 along with the AMA fishbine was indicted for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act the AMA was convicted and fined but fishbine was acquitted still he was lining his pockets under fishbine leadership the public grew more critical of the AMA it seemed like the AMA was interested in making people money not making people healthy fishbine was finally thrown out of the AMA in 1949 and that was the end of the corruption with the AMA and big farm oh I&#x27;m sure everything&#x27;s on the level [Music] now in 1924 Harry hawy developed an unconventional cancer treatment A self-taught Healer from Illinois he claimed his herbal remedy came from his great-grandfather by the 1950s the hawy clinic in Dallas was the world&#x27;s largest private cancer center with branches in 17 States and we now have in our files and our records many many thousands of case histories and Records pathological proof x-ray photographic studies that we do positively cure cancer both internal and external Hoy reported very high success rates which caught the eye of Morris fishbine hoxy gave fishbine and other AMA members a demonstration of his product and Method the next day fishbine offered to buy Hoy formula Hoy was open to the idea but insisted on providing treatment to those who couldn&#x27;t afford it as he did in his clinics fishbine was offended he demanded full control of the business and profits for 9 years after that Hoy would get 10% of the profits if the AMA was satisfied The Cure worked ah yeah hard P yeah hoxy refused and like Royal Raymond rif hoxy faced fish Bin&#x27;s [Music] wrath from 1926 to 1931 hoxy was arrested 119 times for practicing medicine without a license between 1937 and 1939 he was arrested over a 100 times in Texas fishbine labeled hawy the worst cancer quack of the century and pressured the da to shut down his Clinic patients were harassed records seized and clinics closed Hoy fought back he sued fishbine and the AMA for liable and slander and won fishbine was forced to resign and admitted in court that hoy&#x27;s treatment cured external cancer hoxy converted Skeptics including Al Templeton the assistant district attorney of Dallas who had arrested hoxy almost 100 times when templeton&#x27;s Brothers cancer was cured by hoxy Templeton became hoy&#x27;s lawyer in 1939 Esquire journalist James Burke came to Texas to expose the fraud why don&#x27;t you go down to Texas and let expose this fell you getting too big and the American Medical Association liked to put him out of business and said you go down and get acquainted with him and says we&#x27;ll do a couple of pieces on him and put an end to this he stayed six weeks and wrote the quack who cures cancer and became hoy&#x27;s publicist now even though fishbine resigned he was still powerful in 1960 after 36 years of operation hoy&#x27;s clinics were closed even with the support of US senator Elmer Thomas hoy&#x27;s herbal treatment was never officially tested because one Senator is not enough it seems that the medical fraternity is highly organized and that they have decided to crush you and your institution it seems that the public officials are afraid that if they make any move or say anything antagonistic to the wishes of the medical organization they will be pouted upon and destroyed in other words the public officials seem to be afraid of their jobs and even of their lives in the next election the AMA lobbied heavily against Senator Thomas even though Thomas was very popular he was defeated in the primary by Mike Monon the vote was a huge upset and a surprise to everyone but it wasn&#x27;t a surprise to the [Music] AMA anything that comes from nature cannot be patented they&#x27;re not interested in that that and of course the FDA says it&#x27;s illegal to use unless it&#x27;s been tested for efficacy and safety now you see the The Catch 22 you&#x27;re in there nothing from nature regardless of how effective it might be will ever be proven safe or effective according to the FDA it&#x27;ll never be so therefore everything from nature will always be condemned by the FDA as [Music] unproven this was a difficult episode to write cancer affects almost everybody canc hit my family hard over the years it took my dad 2 years ago and if it&#x27;s affecting you right now either directly or indirectly I&#x27;m sorry I really am I know the pain you&#x27;re going through so here are the facts about today&#x27;s story I&#x27;m going to work backward Harry hoy&#x27;s formula is still around but don&#x27;t try it actually don&#x27;t do anything without talking to your doctor hoy&#x27;s formula has been tested and there&#x27;s no proof it cures anything in fact it could even be dangerous need more proof guess how Harry Hoy died don&#x27;t tell me it was cancer cancer prostate cancer he used his formula on himself and it didn&#x27;t work he secretly had surgery and died seven years later seven hard years so don&#x27;t mess with his formula listen to your doctor Morris fishbine and all that nasty stuff about the AMA well that&#x27;s pretty much all true fishbine was sleazy whether he admitted that hoy&#x27;s formula worked I couldn&#x27;t find any proof I think it&#x27;s just part of the legend but in fish B&#x27;s defense he did expose a few frauds the AMA really did start as an organization to crush healers using natural remedies so doctors could make more money but the real history of fishbine in the AMA is hard to find there&#x27;s not a lot of that on the internet you have to dig now Royal Raymond re he wasn&#x27;t a doctor that was an honorary degree he probably wasn&#x27;t killed in the hospital with valume he was most likely taking it himself was he a genius yes did he find the cure for cancer I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s no evidence that his machine worked but some people have tried to build it and got hurt or killed so again don&#x27;t try it and if you see one for sale it&#x27;s a fraud don&#x27;t buy it but you really can destroy things if you expose them to the right frequency so what about cancer cells well I stumbled across this Ted Talk by Anthony Holland from about 10 years ago he&#x27;s a music Professor but he was working with a lab using sound to ATT attack cancer cells we now know that cancer is vulnerable between the frequencies of 100,000 Hertz and 300,000 Hertz so now we attack leukemia cells leukemia cell number one tries to grow a copy of itself but the new cell is shattered into dozens of fragments scattered across the slide and then 7 years ago a TED Talk by Christine Gibbon Now by arranging an array of these elements in a concave formation the transducer then becomes capable of transmitting ultrasonic waves that then increase sharply in strength at the focus by by pulsing those waves we create the histotripsy effect to destroy tissue at the cellular level sounds promising but does it work we don&#x27;t know a bigger darker question is Big Pharma suppressing cures because more sick people mean more profit honestly I don&#x27;t think so really I don&#x27;t I think the companies generally speaking are evil but that&#x27;s mostly a judgment of the people who run them they&#x27;re greedy but that&#x27;s their job they&#x27;re supposed to make money for the people who own the pharmaceutical companies now who owns them well mostly bankers and hedge funds but if you have the 401K a pension or some kind of managed investment account you probably own a little of them too now the doctor scientists and researchers at these pharmaceutical companies aren&#x27;t evil they&#x27;re the opposite of evil those men and women in lab coach going to a lab every day thank God for them and if you&#x27;re one of those people thank you truly if you work in healthcare in any capacity if you&#x27;re an EMT or you&#x27;re a nurse working night shifts or caring for the elderly or working hospice thank you be angry at the corporations be angry at the greed in the boardroom but don&#x27;t be angry at someone who spent half their life in school to sit in front of a microscope for 60 hours a week those are good people down in the labs if there was a cure for cancer or any disease it couldn&#x27;t be kept secret why because those are good people down in the labs besides if there&#x27;s a secret cure for cancer who&#x27;s using it billionaire Elites Steve Jobs was a billionaire Elite he was diagnosed with cancer at age 49 he had the resources for any treatment wanted conventional or otherwise in fact Steve Jobs spent the first N9 months after his diagnosis trying nothing but alternative treatments against his doctor&#x27;s wishes Steve Jobs had unlimited resources and he still lost look I understand why people are drawn to the theories about secret cures and alternative medicine when you are a loved one is suffering and traditional medicine isn&#x27;t working you&#x27;ll try anything that&#x27;s why we call it fighting or surviving cancer it&#x27;s about reclaiming control over your health exploring every possibility and refusing to give up now true or not these are stories of resilience and the belief that answers might exist outside mainstream thinking a miracle cure didn&#x27;t arrive in time to save my dad but it might arrive in time to save yours and if it does I don&#x27;t want any agency or bureaucracy getting in the way that&#x27;s why I was so hard on the AMA today because they have a history of shutting down ideas that aren&#x27;t mainstream we can&#x27;t let that happen again one day another Maverick will come along with a cure that defies mainstream medicine and so-called experts will try to silence them because they can&#x27;t understand anything outside mainstream thinking so here&#x27;s a message to those experts if you&#x27;re not going to help get out of the way I think just out like this and reach back to on
