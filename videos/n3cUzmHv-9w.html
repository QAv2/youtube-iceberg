            <p>Morty, you know why you&#x27;re still broke paying electric bills? Because over a hundred years ago, the government buried Nicola Tesla&#x27;s free energy tech. Wait, free energy? Like no bills, no charging stations? Yes, Morty. Tesla built a tower that could wirelessly power the whole planet. Infinite energy air itself carrying electricity, but greedy corporations shut him down because nothing is free. &gt;&gt; So they just erased it to keep us paying.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Exactly, Morty. Energy is the biggest scam in human history. The whole system runs on keeping you dependent. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re still plugging in your phone like a caveman. &gt;&gt; Oh jeez, Rick, if Tesla was right, we&#x27;ve been robbed for a century.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Morty, we&#x27;re not just robbed. We&#x27;re battery chickens. And you&#x27;ve been paying your electric bill since</p>
