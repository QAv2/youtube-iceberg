            <p>hi I&#x27;m Dr Ronald W SATs founder and chair of the international Society of unified science this is part two of my paper of the case against modern physics number 10 the two capacitor problem conventional Theory says that capacitors which are known to be neutral overall have positive electric charges on one plate and an equal number of negative charges on the other plate consider an electrical circuit with two capacitors in parallel connected by an initially open switch the first capacitor is charged by a voltage source the second capacitor is discharged by short circuiting its plates the voltage source is then disconnected and the switch is closed what happens conventional Theory says that there must be charge conservation and so some of the charge leads the first capacitor moves to the second capacitor the total charge remaining the same as that initially in the first capacitor and the voltage of the two capacitors equilibrating unfortunately for the theory this violates energy conservation for the final voltage of the two capacitors is considerably lower than what would what it would be were energy conservation to hold of course the conventional theorists say that the missing energy simply radiated Away really where&#x27;s the proof reciprical system upholds energy conservation here there are no charges involved and hence no charge conservation there is an increase in the number of electrons massless and chargeless taking part because some of the electrons again massless and charges in the connecting circuit between the capacitors flow into the second capacitor as well as some of the original electrons in the first capacitor therefore at the end of the process the voltage of the two capacitors is higher than that calculated using the conventional equations and thus there is indeed energy conservation the authors has confirmed these deductions by experiment see reference 16 for all the details including the mathematics number 11 magnetism conal Theory says that the colic electric charges of the moving electrons in matter are the cause of all magnetic phenomena even including those of Magneto Statics but conventional theory has no explanation for many of the features of diamagnetism paramagnetism and ferromagnetism for example consider a guey balance which has a horizontal electromagnet when the electromagnet is turned on a diamagnetic specimen initially between the poles moves away from a magnet vert vertically whereas a paramagnetic specimen initially above or below the poles moves toward the space between the poles vertically conventional theory has no explanation for this perpendicular effect but the reciprocal system does actual magnetic charges exist and are two dimensional rotational vibrations a magnetic charge is the two-dimensional analog of the one-dimensional rotational vibration of the electric charge the horizontal forces of the North and South Poles of the electromagnet cancel so they cause no horizontal motion of the specimen the second dimension of magnetism then becomes effective in our reference system and so the specimen moves vertically our ordinary cartisian reference system can directly represent just one dimension of a multi-dimensional motion conventional physics has various theories to explain pherom magnetism including the Heisenberg electron exchange theory and the heitler London Theory neither can be used to compute the values of the magnetic properties of matter reciprocal system by contrast provides a complete set of calculations see reference 15 and see reference 11 for a compendium of the space-time dimensions and natural unit values of physical quantities including all electric and magnetic quantities magnetic quantities which are analogous to Electric quantities have the dimensions of the corresponding electric quantities multiplied by T over s where tals time and S equals space 12 Stellar energy generation the conventional theory of Stellar energy generation is that four hydrogen atoms combined to form one helium atom the change in mass between the reactants and products being converted to energy Stars later stages of evolution are also said to have similar Fusion reactions using elements of pyom number but there are numerous problems with this Theory a the output energy of the O and B classes of stars is so enormous that the hydrogen fuel cannot last for long and so stars of these classes are thought to be young but this is contradicted by the observation that these Stars exist within galaxies or within Galactic clusters which means that they are actually old young Stars may exist only in globular clusters or as a result of the recent Supernova explosion within the Galaxy of an old star which creates a new white dwarf star and a new red giant but these are just fragments of the original globular clusters eventually emerge into the galactic plane becoming Galactic clusters as the Stars continue to age note the relatively few O and B Stars found in globular clusters can be explained as captured stragglers from previous Galactic events B the hydrogen the helium conversion process cannot possibly account for the amazing energy output of the quazar and the centers of active galaxies like sephr galaxies see the output of stars on the main sequence is quite steady and controlled this is contrary to what we observe in the known hydrogen Fusion process the hydrogen bomb D the greater kinetic energy and temperature of atoms and stars should result in more fragmentation not more consolidation e the hydrogen atom is just as stable as the helium atom at high temperatures and therefore just as probable there&#x27;s therefore no reason per se for hydrogen atoms to combine to form helium and F experiments designed to detect neutrinos created as a side effect of the hydrogen Fusion process have usually found far fewer neutrinos and expected originally from the theory of course the Theory&#x27;s been patched since the cical system explanation of Stellar energy generation is that heavy elements in the cellar core fision and by the way they fision by means of the kinetic energy that the atoms toward the center of the star this is the same explanation that conventional physics and the reciprical system used to explain that he generated in the cores of planets radioactivity in the center of the Earth the only difference of course is in the scale all the details to reference one through reference 8 and reference 10 13 Stellar explosions white dwarfs poar quazar radio galaxies the universe is a very violent place supernova create nebuli and white dwarfs or poar exploding galaxies create quazar and radio galaxies conventional theory has a tough time explaining all these events the reciprocal system says the type one Su superan no occur when a hot star reaches a certain temperature or mass limit these occur fairly regularly in any Galaxy and really they&#x27;re quite all alike by contrast most type two superi occur only in the older and larger galaxies these are due to the attainment of an isotopic Mass limit essentially an age limit not just a temperature or size limit conventional Theory says that old Stars settle down to a white but this is based on the pure assumption that red giants are old rather than new as claimed by the reciprocal system because red giants are often found together with white dwars which means that they originated jointly white dwarfs poar and quazar are all very dense the best that conventional Theory can say is that this is due to degenerate matter collapsed atoms leaving just neutrons plus some electrons and therefore neutron stars when the stars fuel runs out but spectroscopy will eventually show that these stars are composed of normal atoms reciprocal system besides that in both white dwarfs and P Arms there is an inverse density gradient so helium will quite naturally appear on the surface with hydrogen underneath whereas in a red giant there is much empty space between the atoms and the white to for psog there is much empty time hence the inversion eventually nebuli condens to red giants which in turn condense back into stars in the main sequence and white DS expand into stars on the name sequence holar have a translational velocity which if sufficiently cause them to leave the Galaxy quaza are essentially just very big po conventional Theory still has no explanation for the existence of quazar and radio galaxies associated with active galaxies currently black holes are hypothesized to somehow explain the energy output of such entities but this contradicts the theory that nothing can escape black hole not even white the cical system says the quazar and Madeo galaxies res from Galactic explosions and are powered by ongoing Supernova explosions mostly type two for the details see reference three D be Larson&#x27;s astrophysical master the universe of motion 14 Galactic structure the conventional theorist have trouble explaining how galaxies can form given that their Big Bang Theory claims that the matter is dispersed in all directions at very high speeds even above the speed of light and the inflationary part away from the alleged point of the explosion how could this eventually condense in various locations most conventional theorists say that the big things like galaxies came first the usual suggestion is that there were fluctuations in the density of the dispersed matter and so by probability there were some clums of matter which then grew to form the Stars galaxies we now see as for the globular clusters the theorists say that they originated with the galaxies therefore to them the globular clusters are old but the stars and globular clusters are mostly relatively new and another thing the the used to think that Galaxy formation was finished many billions of years ago but now there are solid observational evidence to the contrary the reciprocal system says no to all the conventional Theory there was no big bang the matter was not originally concentrated it was initially widely dispersed there is a gravitational limit of matter within which atoms attract one another to form dust particles and then eventually stars outside the gravitational limit the matter moves apart due to the SpaceTime progression the first Association of stars are globular clusters the individual stars of which are moving apart from one another but remaining together by the mass of the globular cluster as a whole these then combine to form small galaxies and the small galaxies then combine to form the big galaxies Galaxy formation is a continuing process see reference 214 calculation of the gravitational limits and the Hubble costume for the local group galaxies the in cosmology and metaphysics conventional physicists think that our physical universe is on a one-way process from the big bag to the formation of stars and galaxies and then eventually to the running out of Stellar fuel which means the end of All Stars the final result is a totally cold lifeless Universe most conventional theorists also think that our physical universe is the total of all existence I do think that there are a number of physical universes within a Multiverse regardless most believe there&#x27;s no metaphysical reality in contrast the cyclical system is a cyclical Theory material galaxies end their lives in a huge explosion or explosions creating quazar whose matter eventually leaves our material sector for the cosmic or inverse sector the material atoms transform to Cosmic atoms which eventually coess to form Cosmic stars and Cosmic globular clusters these globular clusters combined to form of small galaxies which then combine to form large galaxies these eventually end their lives in a huge explosion or explosions creating Cosmic quazar whose matter eventually enters our material sectum isotropically these are the cosmic RS the whole cycle then repeats Etc given that the reciprocal system is a cyclical Theory we cannot say definitively whether or not there was a creation if there were we can speculate on the cause in reciprocal system metaphysics there is a region of existence termed the me the metaphysical realm which is comprised of non-space time units see the appendix for the postulates Govern governing this realm the proof that there is such a realm is that human beings are compound structures part physical and part metaphysical we are creative and ethical and intuitive whereas a purely physical mechanism like a machine or a plan or animal is not creative or ortal or intuitive it just does what it was designed to do or evolved to do and no more the physical universe is a physical mechanism although things are always changing in detail there is no overall change it is cyclical and no new class of objects is created after the first cycle therefore there must be a metaphysical realm discretized into units which is the source of our creativity our ethics our intuition and our status as observers this realm is beyond space and time and so there&#x27;s no infinite regress conceivably a portion of the non-space time units transform the SpaceTime units and displacements photons sub atoms atoms but material and Cosmic to form our physical universe and others of existence as Multiverse the sum of the original non-space time units equals in some manner the sum of the SpaceTime units and displacements created so there&#x27;s no violation of a very generalized conservation mod both the Physical Realm and the met and the metaphysical realm are huge but finite the above speculation gets around the problem of The Big Bang Theory and the M or membrane Theory which has to explain where all the matter energy came from in the first place and how it could all be concentrated into to a point smaller than an atom conventional theories have many infinities and singularities the reciprocal system does not see reference 9 and reference 22 conclusion this paper provides a detailed reputation of many of the physical concepts of modern physics included are those from the conventional theories of space time photons sub atoms atoms Atomic bonding electric and thermal currents capacitors magnetism Stellar energy generation Stellar explosions Galactic structure and cosmology and metaphysics reciprocal system of theory is shown to be a much more rational logical Paradigm for the physical universe and Beyond the reader should now be better prepared the reader review of this should now be better prepared to comprehend reference 1 through reference 22 it&#x27;s time for college and University professors to replace courses on Modern physics with courses on the reciprocal system acknowledgements funing for this work came from transpower Corporation not the government of course great thanks go to Dewey B Larson who served as my theoretical physics Mentor from 1965 until his death in 1990 he was by far the most intelligent and most logical of any individual I&#x27;ve ever know references you can see this the first set here 1 through n are JY B larsson&#x27;s books reference 10 is my Mysterious Universe then starting with reference 11 and 12 and the next page these are my papers all which can be found at transp power. wordpress.com free uh PDFs F Sprint 3 is the chemical properties handbook by Professor Jas it&#x27;s helpful having that for the empirical regression equations to compare with the theoretical calculations of the sub system qu mechanics is totally useless and of course a reference 24 is Samuel Alexander&#x27;s Masterpiece SpaceTime deity and 25 is p work now let&#x27;s go over the appending carefully these are the postul of the reciprocal system and the metaphysical realm the First Fundamental posture the physical universe is composed entirely of one component space time or Motion in the most General sense existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time second fundamental postulate the physical Universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commu with mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is idium third fundamental postulate which is implied the physical universe is logical orderly and rational now for the metaphysical postulates first metaphysical postulate there are existences in the metaphysical region of a more General and less restricted type than the units of motion that are the basic constituents of the physical unit second metaphysical postula the metaphysical existences are logical orderly and rational third metaphysical posture metaphysical existence conforms to a specific set of laws and principles different in some respects no of the physical universe and the fourth metaphysical postulate is the metaphysical existences of which we have evidence or intelligence Arista tillian logic including the laws of identity and causality apply to entities of both the physical universe and the metaphysical realm there are no contradictions anywhere the metaphysical units are non-space time units they are therefore beyond space and time there&#x27;s thus no infinite regress that completes my paper the case against modern physics</p>
