            <p>black programs are a real thing I mean there&#x27;s a whole black budget it&#x27;s a real thing and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s an important thing because if you know what the budget is that&#x27;s being spent you can start to ascertain or start to deduce what it might be being spent on so a black budget is an important thing even to protect from accountants at CIA understanding what CIA is doing they don&#x27;t have a need to know so why should they know whether we&#x27;re spending 1 trillion or 12 trillion right whatever it might be so black budgets are an important thing when it comes to people who are who are whistleblowing in general I find that it basically breaks into two camps you&#x27;ve got genuine whistleblowers who know something is going on that shouldn&#x27;t be and they&#x27;ve tried to go through the proper channels and the proper channels either haven&#x27;t worked or they or they&#x27;re working too slow so they come out publicly and blow the whistle then you have other people who are just not right just not mentally right in the head and they&#x27;ve been in something so long or they&#x27;re in something so deep so deep they&#x27;ve lost the large perspective they&#x27;ve lost the mission essentially and then they come out and they whistleblow from what I&#x27;ve heard grush is more of the is the true type of whistleblower saw stuff that and then had people on the inside that just weren&#x27;t working fast enough or he wasn&#x27;t being taken seriously so he came out and spoke but there are plenty of other examples of whistleblowers who do the opposite Danny what did sarfati say about grush again what was his take on that he&#x27;s a [ __ ] idiot no I I I I get a little I get a little skeptical and I think a lot of people out there do when you see things pile on in almost in unison in way from so many governments I mean we just saw like that video in Mexico I I don&#x27;t know if we can put that in the corner of the screen Stephen or if that&#x27;s copyrighted the aliens they just found in Mexico no that like I said that shit&#x27;s been on the internet for a long time but now they&#x27;re like putting this whole dog and pony show on to make sure [ __ ] everybody sees it you know and and I&#x27;ll I&#x27;ll say like when you listen to to grush talk at Congress like not that this really counts for anything but he comes across as pretty credible but there&#x27;s also so many arguments about what these things are are they crafts from another planet are they future humans you get the religious sect that wonders if they&#x27;re like demons so there you know some of it sounds crazy but if we don&#x27;t know what it is we don&#x27;t know what it is and and and when you when you hear them going through in the boxes you know when he says stuff about we have I may get this wording a little wrong but he&#x27;s like we have possession of biological call entities Biologicals Biologicals not of this planet or something like that is it this is that what he&#x27;s referring to is it the little green man that James Fox is is talking about in so many of his sightings or you know is it something else I don&#x27;t know yeah and it&#x27;s important because biologics what else is biological plants MH right samples there&#x27;s all sorts of things germs viruses what is and taking things out of context and especially when it comes to the way government people speak versus the way that the L civilian speaks we speak in completely different terms government people work really hard to use terminology that they can&#x27;t be like held accountable to in the future right so it&#x27;s overgeneralized and underc committed meanwhile civilians civilians are coming out and they want to be like hyper specific about everything so that&#x27;s why you hear terms like we have biological uh proof or evidence that is not of this planet or not of this own [Applause] planets frh</p>
