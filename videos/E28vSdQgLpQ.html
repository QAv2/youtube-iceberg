            <p>now you ladies are no strangers when it comes to defying all odds in the beauty world now is it shocking that we&#x27;re still in a climate of educating others about the beauty of black women no I don&#x27;t think so I feel like that&#x27;s what&#x27;s it right now like our black community is taking over a lot of businesses a lot of hair companies everything is black business it&#x27;s everything is public and just to elaborate on your experience that you had on different sets that too wrong I feel as if knowing that you have a black actor actress or black that black leading role I feel like if you&#x27;re wearing a weave it should be somebody that&#x27;s this this person is wearing a weave let&#x27;s get somebody in here who&#x27;s expert at week so she looks her best because when I&#x27;m watching TV I criticize I&#x27;d be like why do i girl look like that black girl didn&#x27;t get them edges right there or I&#x27;ll be like she got on a new part and you could tell because they didn&#x27;t blend that with that I know when I meet people in person I&#x27;ll be like I see that such a you know an increase in black businesses and a focus on our communities right like people finally sort of recognize us why the industry not catching up though why do we still go to sets and it&#x27;s still like not we&#x27;re not being represented with the hair and makeup team because there&#x27;s not enough of us behind the scenes bringing this point up a lot of times as a casting director and we have a department head meetings I&#x27;m the only black person in the room so if you don&#x27;t have any one black behind-the-scenes speaking up and saying hey we got black girls we need to make sure we have somebody knows black skin and black hair so there&#x27;s no representation behind the scenes to speak up for what&#x27;s going on with the actors I think that you know it definitely matters that we have a seat at the table behind the scenes I created a whole company as a result of that linking talent of color with production because I recognized that I was one of the only people that looked like me behind the scenes and quite frankly we&#x27;re out here you know we&#x27;re talented we&#x27;re capable residential as long as we can continue to advocate for each other and recognize that for every person that&#x27;s in the room you represent everyone that comes behind you and I take that very seriously okay the glamour is all soon all right Melissa 80% of your work in television is with non black talent has anyone ever questioned you about your experience doing makeup on people who are not black okay like a qualified to do this one it&#x27;s kids you know it&#x27;s a little bit more subtle than that because you know they walk into the glam room and they feel the inner I can feel the energy of them taking a little bit you know taking aback by me physically and what I represent but you know I am therefore I&#x27;m a professional so I know how to disarm anyone that comes into the ground I will compliment something that they&#x27;re wearing if I&#x27;ve done my research I&#x27;ve already googled maybe they had a recent press release and I complement then I&#x27;m on unaccomplished so when you sort of disarm them things become you know your more relatable and then then you can get the work done so it does require us to have a little humility and realize that yes we&#x27;re coming from two different worlds and it&#x27;s not personal and I get it and so I think that it&#x27;s just a matter of how we are able to get past some of those subtle discriminations to get the work done are you usually the only black makeup artist on ffense I am usually a lot of the productions that I&#x27;ve been working on as of late I am the only makeup artists of color however I demanded my deal memo that I have an assistant and guess what she&#x27;s she or he is going to look like then I also demand the rate you know because I know my worth and I know that it&#x27;s important that you know we come in asking for what we want that&#x27;s the only what we&#x27;re gonna get it is if we ask and there absolutely is a black rate yes there is a black lace I have been on sets where I found out I was making 1/3 of what the white girls make you and I walked out I started to walk off the set before because I was doing twice the work and it&#x27;s scary but it&#x27;s something that we have to do if we care about the women coming behind us mm-hmm because if we are okay with that they&#x27;re just continue to do if you don&#x27;t call them out what and they will say something like well that&#x27;s you know the urban budget with the urban buses like they&#x27;ve said that yeah no you&#x27;re right they&#x27;ll say this is the rate that we&#x27;ve been paying in Atlanta or other markets where they&#x27;re shooting on like no but this is California and this is what we&#x27;re asking for and if you want us then you know pay us what we exactly [Applause] people not being fearless I mean saying being fearless take something fearless and not being afraid like well if I say there&#x27;s someone else just get it I need the money it&#x27;s still kind of like a catch-22 right it is however what is fear it is absolute illusion and you have a lot of people who don&#x27;t look like us who are demanding that every single day yeah so we really have nothing to lose at the end of the day you know and and quite frankly if you ask and they don&#x27;t give it to you and you lose that opportunity trust and believe another door is going to open every bag</p>
