            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas I do videos on many different subjects we are looking at the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson uh he wrote many many books back in the 20th century on his Theory of Everything which can be summarized that the universe is not made out of matter it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is made out of motion or he would also say change in three dimensions uh motion a scalar motion motion with no uh particular direction um or all particular directions you can think of it as uh taking a balloon putting a bunch of dots on the balloon and then blowing up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other uh but they&#x27;re not moving in any particular direction or all directions or just inhaling and then sucking the balloon back and then all the dots are moving toward each other are now um we are so he took that basic idea of universe is made out of motion motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other meaning that they have the same general qualities but they have um a reciprocal nature so they you can invert them to get kind of the opposite and they both have three dimensions or four I would say and they also have uh they are progressing so time is always getting later and later space is always getting further and further and further apart and they both are quantized meaning they have a minimum unit uh one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light and the speed of light is the boundary between the um what he calls the material sector the sector that we&#x27;re more familiar with uh of chemical uh chemistry and atoms and molecules and the cosmic sector which is the Beyond light speed sector and but when you have a material body uh a chemical Aggregate and it Aggregates to a complicated enough level or complex enough level then it can be eligible to be accommodated or joined by a cosmic unit and this uh joining between a material and Cosmic unit uh is what he calls life life unit and the life unit then can become more and more complicated until it reaches its most complicated level which um is Larson calls that the intelligent human and that uh then can be uh taken over under the uh control of a sector 3 unit uh the material being sector one the cosmic being sector two sector three is really the uh a unit that is actually independent of space and time and I would argue that it that that is light itself and that uh that is uh governed by ethical principles or good principles and so uh the intelligent human uh there has the uh has two different controls one is governed by survival and the other one is governed by ethics and so that is kind of where we are as humans and this is the topic of his final book that came out in the uh in 1995 five years after he died and um it is called beyond space and time and it&#x27;s you know all of the all of the rest of his books are on the hard harder Sciences uh including economics but mostly physics and chemistry and astronomy but this one delves into uh philosophy and religion um a little bit of biology and some psychology and we are looking at uh chapter 13. this is I think about the 31st video that I&#x27;ve done on uh this book beyond space and time and uh we&#x27;re in the middle of chapter 13 which is called emotions and uh last time we were just talking about the um fear and anger being like the primary emotions they&#x27;re being opposite to each other and then he was kind of comparing them with joy and pleasure and so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where we are right here um discussing uh the distinctions between fear and anger and then joy and pleasure okay looking at the situation from another Direction fear and anger like intelligence for which they are very limited substitutes are tools for attaining human or animal objectives joy and sadness are reactions of the organism to the achievement or failure to achieve these those objectives in reality they are merely relatively intense forms of Pleasure and Pain respectively for present purposes we will call these results of actions that have taken place or are taking place Sensations to distinguish them from emotions uh the reactions to stimuli that determine the actions that the individual will take if not overruled by reason okay so he or uh before this he had identified emotions as being a more General and inferior form of reason that reason comes to more specific conclusions but they are basically competing against each other uh reason and emotion but reason will always win but emotion was established much earlier in the so-called evolutionary scale and uh so emotions had a huge Head Start Over reason but reason is narrowing the Gap but for things like joy and sadness he&#x27;s calling those Sensations as opposed to emotions now um we had just gotten done with uh four chapters that were talking about Communications from sector three this ethical uh independent uh General um region and um those are variously called ESP intuition scientific insight and religious Revelation and so those are sector three uh coming from this uh this good ethical region uh emotions are really a sector two thing that have more to do with and so is reason that have more to do with survival but he says that the the intelligence is the uh prerequisites for uh the sector three communication Okay so now he goes on in as much as this present work is a scientific investigation of the metaphysical region and the effect of influences from that region on human life we are concerned with emotions and Sensations only is so far as they have some bearing on the relations between man and sector three fear and anger come from come within our fear field of study because they like intelligence are tools that can be applied to the furtherance or hindrance of objectives that are in harmony with the principles of sector three Sensations such as joy and sorrow on the other hand have no sector 3 significance if an individual experiences anything that could be called a sensation just because he does the morally right thing in a given set of circumstances it is not Joy Joy results from the successful accomplishment of some sector 2 objective biological social economic Etc similarly sadness sorrow or grief the sensations that are aroused by failure to reach sector two objectives or loss of some source of enjoyment are not relevant to the matters now under consideration as the word is commonly used emotion refers to a consciously felt state says Hall um most of these physiological states included under this definition are neither pure emotions comparable to fear nor pure Sensations comparable to Joy but combinations of the two together with various elements of what the psychologists call drives for example finality or a close approximation there too is a prerequisite for evoking objective related states such as Joy the prize must be won or the battle lost the outcome is still uncertain the physiological state will be more complex perhaps it will be anxiety a rather vague form of fear mixed with various Sensations from the standpoint of the present investigation the physiological results of taking actions that have moral significance are of particular interest as already noted doing the morally right thing does not evoke joy in the ordinary sense of that term it may Foster some kind of a feeling of being in harmony with the better aspects of human life and this could be considered a sensation the results of taking an action that is morally wrong depend upon two factors one the ultimate outcome of the action and two whether or not the individual remains convinced that he made a sound decision that decision was reached because of his belief that it would produce a net total of desirable results unless there were some kind of miscalculation the action should have produced some kind of satisfaction perhaps even enough to arouse Joy the successful criminal may be quite elated over his accomplishment actual practice miscalculation is very common and the person who finds himself in prison or otherwise penalized for his action is likely to be subject to regret for our purposes regret will have to be classed with Sensations such as joy and sorrow since it has no sector 3 implications but if the individual now realizes either because a reconsideration of the situation has been forced upon him by the troubles in which he is now enmeshed or for some other reason that his decision with respect to taking the action was contrary to his own moral standards he may experience remorse which is a strong often overpowering emotion that calls for xba to reaction a prerequisite for remorse is a feeling of guilt but the existence of the guilt sensation is not necessarily accompanied by remorse all that is necessary to arouse the guilt sensation is a recognition that the ACT is morally wrong so to recognition recognition usually exists at the time of the original decision to take the action and it is one of the factors that in entered into that decision since the decision was taken in spite of whatever feeling of guilt may have existed the emotion of remorse follows only if there is a reconsideration of that decision and if at the time of the reconsideration the desire to conform to the moral code is strong enough to outweigh whatever moral benefit whatever non-moral benefits may have accrued from the action the conflicts between some of the conclusions reached in the preceding pages and opinions expressed in current psychological and philosophical literature are due primarily to the fact that we are using the term emotion in a limited sense so most philosophers are using emotions to also cover Sensations and Larson is trying to restrict that meaning um because he says that the sensations have no sector 3 implications whereas the emotions do these emotions are in active competition with intelligence and the extent to which any individual is able to overrule them is a Criterion or prerequisite of the stage that he has reached in his Advance along the evolutionary Road leading upward from his animal background this Criterion will be even more significant in application to the next class of emotions that we will consider all of the emotions and Sensations thus far considered may be classified as personal that is there related to the individual&#x27;s own situation he fears that which may cause harm to him or his possessions he experiences Joy when something directly or indirectly favorable to him occurs he know he knows anxiety when his interests are in jeopardy uh and so on but in addition there are what we may call social emotions similar states that are related to the situations of others inasmuch as an emotion of this kind involves three elements the individual&#x27;s own feelings his perception of the situations of other persons involved and the relations between between him and the others it is a complex phenomenon of love for example is practically undefinable for present purposes the exact nature of these social emotions is immaterial they are subject to essentially the same considerations um as emotions they constitute a biological mechanism whereby an individual&#x27;s reaction to a situation involving interpersonal relationships is determined in the same manner as his reaction to a situation that arouses fear or anger that is each emotion evokes a standard response unlike the personal emotion they produce little or no observable physiological effects and for that reason the psychologists are not inclined to classify them with the personal emotions uh and he um cites uh a number of um psychologist or philosophers here taking an action an action taken out of sympathy for an Afflicted person without any rational consideration of the question as to whether the action was justified is ordinarily called an emotional reaction to the situation although here again no physiological evidence of the emotion is usually visible emotions of this character are social emotions uh the psychological changes accompanying a primary personal emotion are bodily preparations for the actions that result from the emotion fear for example initiates preparations for a quick flight now ordinarily the actions that result from the social emotions if not prevented by the reasoning process are not of an urgent nature nor are they of great personal concern um so no special physiological preparation is required there is another significant difference between personal and social emotions unless some abnormality exists personal emotions are always intended to serve the interest of the individual social emotions are of two kinds as in the kind of situation just mentioned They may involve sympathy with the person uh or persons concerned um and they will generate uh they generate uh the actions they generate will be favorable to those persons but instead They may involve some degree of antipathy uh in which case the actions will be unfavorable to those that are affected unlike the purely personal emotions which never rank higher than ethically neutral the social emotions may may have positive ethical value depending on the circumstances here again the more advanced type of mechanism reason that is available to human beings for making personal decision decisions is also available as an alternate to the social emotions in the area of personal Behavior where the true nature of the conflicts between reason and emotion is clearly visible the superiority of reason is not seriously challenged in the absence of any difference in kind between the decisions to be made in the social areas and those that are made in the personal areas it necessarily follows that reason is Superior in the social areas as well but this point is not generally conceited um and uh many decisions are made routinely on the basis of emotional reactions whether rather than the result of reasoned conclusions foreign personal decision is to be made an individual tends to look at all angles of the problem even though emotion may call for immediate and drastic reaction or action anyone in full possession of his faculties will at least listen to what his reason tells him before he makes his move on the other hand if an emotion of sympathy for some person or group calls for some supportive action the questions that can be answered by reason um are not of enough personal concern to generate the kind of careful consideration that would be required in order to arrive at a rational evaluation of the situation all right so um these social issues which get so little rational consideration are actually much more complex than the personal problems that are so carefully evaluated um an act of compassion based on an emotion of sympathy for a criminal may not only be detrimental to that individual in the long run but may result in serious consequences to other persons whose interests were given no consideration when the decision was made a law based on an emotion of sympathy for low-paid workers and intended to give them higher pay or better working conditions May in fact deny them employment a measure aimed at a corporation against which there is an emotional Prejudice may actually accomplish nothing but raise prices for that corporation&#x27;s customers and so on indefinitely uh for that you would probably need to look at Larson&#x27;s works on economics uh but we&#x27;re almost done with his chapter we&#x27;ll be finishing this tomorrow um but that&#x27;s all for today uh so have a great day and hope to see you back tomorrow to discuss emotions and then uh the next chapter is on uh thinking and memory have a good day</p>
