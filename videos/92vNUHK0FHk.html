            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>dr gary nolan is deeply interested in the subject of ufos or as the pentagon likes to call it unidentified aerial phenomena playing games with your mind like this frankly just keeps you sharp but what distinguishes dr gary nolan even more is that he&#x27;s not just intellectually interested in ufos i mean i have some in a locked bank account he claims to have what may be ufo parts in his possession a fisherman saw a glowing object and it just suddenly exploded and you&#x27;ll have to stick around to the end of this episode where we actually see and discuss these ufo parts why isn&#x27;t the government immediately funding this research maybe the stuff that we have somebody is sitting around saying laughably they&#x27;re wasting their time on exhaust we have the engine but before you say jesse what the [ __ ] are you talking about this is absolutely insane the story gets even crazier just a few years ago the cia actually came knocking on dr gary nolan&#x27;s door for help at first i thought it was a joke i really did i was looking across the way here to see if there was a camera the agency wanted to see if people who had claimed ufo contact had any neurological and physiological differences nolan actually thinks that these particular parts of the basal ganglia called the caudate nucleus and the potamin could actually have something to do with people&#x27;s ability to see and encounter ufos i mean alien means alien they&#x27;re either from another planet in this galaxy or elsewhere or they&#x27;re from another level of reality that we don&#x27;t understand or they&#x27;ve been here all along and they just show up to look at us because they&#x27;re basically maybe looking at their past so if you like crazy [ __ ] like this and you want more hit subscribe now and if you haven&#x27;t already unbuckle your brain lean back and get ready for this week&#x27;s american alchemist dr gary nolan i&#x27;m here with my friend dr gary nolan here at the nolan research lab at stanford very few people i think marry traditional science and the study of anomalous kind of heterodox subjects like ufos and aliens where did your interest stem from originally somewhere very early on i started reading science fiction do you have any favorite authors or more recently ian banks and arthur c clarke obviously amazing and arthur c clarke wrote 2001 space odyssey right right and i always found interesting you know kind of the monolith in 2001 space odyssey yeah which is this sort of thing placed on earth that it inspires tech innovation it&#x27;s almost like john mack would talk about a lot of these alien sightings being slightly more advanced but barely comprehensible tech for the time almost inspiring tech innovation i often think of it as laying breadcrumbs in a direction what are the areas of microbiology that you&#x27;re currently most excited about so right now primarily i would say we&#x27;re interested in cancer and understanding how cancer is put together this is a set of robots you program each station science in its essence and scientists are capitalists most of the biology scientists in the country have some relationship to studying cancer why because the nci the national cancer institute is one of the biggest institutes in the country for doling out money so you follow the money and if there&#x27;s no money for doing this research and there&#x27;s no positive feedback for it and if anything negative feedback then the science doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t advance this is a crucial point despite the upper echelon of society actually being pretty interested in ufos it suffers from a severe lack of resources just look at the main ufo program over the last 15 years out of the dod it&#x27;s called atip or the advanced aerospace threat identification program atip has a 22 million dollar budget just compare that to fighter jet budgets which often exceed 100 billion dollars in other words discovering extraterrestrial life and even propulsion that could be stepwise better than what we currently have gets less than one percent of the current f-35 budget from my point of view when i got involved the cia came to my office [Music] i mean at first i thought it was a joke i really did i was looking across the way here at some of the other offices to see if there was a camera and so they said we asked around and everybody said that you&#x27;ve built the best tool called scitov i was introduced to others who were i think you people called them the invisible college it was people like jacques people like hal put off eric davis and robert bigelow and colin kelleher and then they showed me mris of some of these people and most of those people had interactions with ufos and these were department of defense and intelligence people so supposedly and reasonably credible individuals so in looking at the mris of some of these people we noticed a area of the brain that seemed to be disturbed let&#x27;s say or different in many of these individuals so it&#x27;s an area that i&#x27;ve talked about before between the head of the caudate and the potamon that had increased neural density and it was larger in all these individuals and so you just ask the question okay what&#x27;s unique about these individuals well they&#x27;re all highly functioning and you have to make snap decisions and so what is that that&#x27;s intuition one way to explain it would be intuition or just highly intelligent and then surprisingly when we looked in the family members we found that the family members had it which was fascinating so that means that structure had a genetic component whatever it was here&#x27;s a question are you do you have a genetic and phenotypic predisposition to seeing the ufos or post contact do you now have a more neuronally dense caudate nucleus and potatoes no i don&#x27;t think i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s changed they&#x27;re just able to as you say see it they&#x27;re able to recognize it for what it might be and not dismiss it maybe it&#x27;s allowing us to kind of widen the doors of our normal limited scope of perception right you&#x27;re seeing these ufos that exist kind of interstitially in reality that other people just can&#x27;t see our senses are a filter to stop our brains from being overwhelmed with reality and so what we see is a limited of everything around us but that is a different model of reality than people currently have today but it&#x27;s one i&#x27;m sympathetic to which is that the sensory organs are not necessarily productive they&#x27;re reductive oh yeah absolutely no they&#x27;re reductive yes yeah on a default state of almost greater omniscience but an inability to make sense of right things uh i i just don&#x27;t know whether or not it is an antenna or anything like that um it just allows us to interpret things better right so for instance as a form of japanese chess which is a smaller number of pieces etc so they took masters in this set up brainwave um to figure out what area of the brain might be involved with intuitive moves where you&#x27;re you you basically you make the unexpected but brilliant correct move and at those moments the caudate containment lit up that&#x27;s interesting i find that fascinating and we&#x27;re actually working on both in using both autism and schizophrenics because this area of the brain in both autism and schizophrenia is can be damaged but if you think a little bit about it you know schizophrenics hear things and see things that nobody else sees yes so are are they all crazy well that goes into the transmission theory i think schizophrenics just it&#x27;s like a transmitter being broken or oscillating between different they can&#x27;t turn it off you can&#x27;t turn it off they can&#x27;t turn it off so we went deep on brain structures the other component of this is materials i think a lot of people will be incredibly excited that there are even ufo materials that have been possibly left behind so jacques valet has collected these kinds of materials from all over the world jacques valet is pretty impressive in his own right he helped develop a computerized map of mars while at nasa and he developed one of the early versions of the internet called arpanet with doug engelbart he&#x27;s also the inspiration for the french scientist played by francois truffaut in steven spielberg&#x27;s close encounters of the third kind jacques was the original person who put forth the multi-dimensional hypothesis the idea that aliens could co-exist alongside us but remain unseen for this he received a lot of backlash from other ufologists in short he was too weird even for the weirdest jacquesville publishes his address online so people who witness ufo crashes across the country can send him the parts but he has no real way of doing analysis on the parts without sending them to a doctor gary nolan who can do spectroscopy and real material analysis on them dr jacques valet has collected purported metal debris from ufo cases dating as far back as 1947 that experts are analyzing in a state-of-the-art laboratory the breakthrough has come with the invention of a machine that enables us to look at the atomic structure and at that point the the atomic structure is impossible to fake this device is a multi-parameter ion beam imager dr gary nolan a stanford microbiologist is using a revolutionary three-dimensional imaging device to analyze the samples right down to their individual atoms when dr nolan placed some of the fragments in the vacuum chamber of his instrument he was astonished to find their composition was unlike any known metal just one spot and the isotopic composition all the way across the no matter where he looked in the sample&#x27;s jumble of elements whether magnesium iron nickel or titanium the ratio of isotopes didn&#x27;t make any sense if you&#x27;re talking about an advanced material from an advanced civilization you&#x27;re talking about something that i&#x27;ll just call it an ultra material right it&#x27;s something which has properties where somebody is is putting it together again at the atomic scale so we&#x27;re building our world with 80 elements somebody else is building the world with 253 different isotopes i intend to use the information to try to build something to try to understand a physical principle that we don&#x27;t know today this material was manufactured it&#x27;s not natural it&#x27;s not natural to the materials that we have around us in the lab or on the earth it does not mean that it was necessarily made someplace in outer space just means that it was manufactured specially for a particular purpose that we don&#x27;t understand and we want to understand it the first question is what was unique about many of these samples they were ejected from these objects one of the most interesting samples nolan mentions is from ubertuba brazil where a fisherman witnessed an exploding orb off the coast and collected some of the parts it turned out it was magnesium at an extremely high level of purity but that&#x27;s strange because magnesium burns like hell so obviously it had something else in it so yeah we did uh we did a mass spectrometry analysis of some of those pieces with a highly sensitive instrument um it&#x27;s over in the engineering department called a nano sims it&#x27;s a secondary ion mass spec as it&#x27;s called and basically what it lets you what what it lets you do is determine uh not just the elements by their mass but also the isotopes by their mass right and one of them was anomalous the magnesium ratios were way off i mean not even close to being natural that&#x27;s interesting yeah right so you would never find this you would never find it in nature you&#x27;d never find it in nature and you need some sort of centrifuge or something to create that yes isotope ratio would that be possible oh it&#x27;s possible but it&#x27;s just expensive beyond you know most people don&#x27;t have access to that dispute especially when these uh things were found and the morning question is why would you do it would you do what&#x27;s the motivation what&#x27;s the motivation for it is it is it something that they&#x27;re using and they need that ratio to accomplish something or is it a byproduct of an of an effect that where they take the natural things and then they&#x27;re doing something and this ends up being the outcome and then when they&#x27;re done with it they go and they throw it out right whether or not these objects are trying to show us something or they don&#x27;t care we see this happening and that maybe tells you something you know you can sort of reverse engineer from first principles maybe what that is nobody that i know has figured it out when you look at the five observables of the unidentified aerial phenomena task force things like trans-medium travel you know the ability to sort of break conservation of momentum and stop on a dime are these possibly isotope ratios that unlock these features that&#x27;s what uh that&#x27;s what you have to come to a conclusion it&#x27;s used in something maybe some of these things that we see are not even technological maybe they are some kind of living thing well some of the i remember like commander david fraber the nimitz sighting 2004. himself looking at the ufo and it&#x27;s almost as if the thing sees that he&#x27;s looking at it and he&#x27;s conscious and almost breathing we&#x27;re all going against the wind the wind&#x27;s 120 west but if there&#x27;s anything why isn&#x27;t the government immediately funding this research i mean it feels insane you tell me and maybe they have done it maybe the stuff that we have somebody is sitting around saying laughably they&#x27;re wasting their time right on exhaust we have the engine if something came from you know the andromeda galaxy and it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s a million years ahead of us it lands on earth it has technologies that we don&#x27;t understand some people think that aliens might be us from the future yeah and if you think about the way we&#x27;re evolving it&#x27;s probably smaller bodies bigger heads yeah you know sort of what what you would see a grey alien looking like i&#x27;ve always been interested in the five percent i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;ll publish the 95 i do know yeah but i&#x27;m always interested in the stuff that i can&#x27;t explain because almost every major discovery has been somebody looking at anomalous data and then constructing a new theory yes of reality yes right and that&#x27;s thomas kuhn the structure of scientific revolutions yeah the notion that almost every scientific revolution was fought tooth and nail by the more conservative skeptics saying you can&#x27;t possibly be right and thomas kuhn was friends with john mack who was yeah the head of the harvard psychiatry department who spent the latter part of his career studying alien abductions which i didn&#x27;t know that yeah and he encouraged him to do the study cool yeah that&#x27;s interesting yeah i&#x27;m going to use that in my talks you should um you know that&#x27;s i think where we&#x27;re at right now the preponderance of evidence now and the department of defense admitting that these things are real that the data is real not what the there&#x27;s no conclusions yeah um the data is real the theory maybe i like best is the jacques valet diana pasalka theory that 1947 in the roswell crash represented this dividing line and before that people were seeing angels demons leprechauns fairies whatever the sort of local contemporary lore of where the sighting took place was and then after aliens became something in the zeitgeist that&#x27;s what people started to see but you&#x27;re seeing some sort of kind of proto-architecture of a thing that involves beings and crafts and then you&#x27;re recollecting it in this way that is comprehendable to you given kind of like the noble myth or the myth of the time right i use the example of let&#x27;s say that there&#x27;s a a race of intelligent ants out in your garden they don&#x27;t have a clue what&#x27;s going on up in the kitchen right they couldn&#x27;t understand it if they wanted to and neither could you understand what their communications are how do you talk to them well the first thing you would probably do is make a little thing that looks like an ant yeah and put it there yeah and have it do something yeah and so maybe that&#x27;s what it is maybe that i mean alien means alien yeah right i mean it&#x27;s so far different from us that it&#x27;s doing its best to talk to us in ways that it can do they&#x27;re either from another planet in this galaxy or elsewhere underground or nearby or whatever and they just show up to look at us and because they&#x27;re basically maybe looking at their past or they&#x27;re interdimensional or they&#x27;re from another level of reality that we don&#x27;t understand all speculation yeah but fun yeah you can run your mind down those possibilities and realize how much bigger a universe you live in that&#x27;s exciting than what you&#x27;re dealing with day to day yes to have a group of scientists who are supposed to be leading thinkers debase people who are interested in thinking about new ideas is to me that&#x27;s heretical and it feels like it&#x27;s gotten worse in terms of um established scientists like we talk about like the fermi paradox which is like the sort of mental model or like question of like you know why don&#x27;t we see aliens that&#x27;s enrico fermi that guy created the theoretical underpinnings for splitting the atom right you know he was in the manhattan project sort of as conventionally well regarded as it gets right and he was thinking about aliens in his off time at los alamos right so it&#x27;s like why can&#x27;t we do that when your mind expands to a certain point in terms of what you might consider reality to be other entities live there so this should be a rallying cry to anybody watching on the financing front is there any way we can see the materials uh i mean i have some in a locked bank account thank you honestly i didn&#x27;t i don&#x27;t have it hanging around here okay okay i could do a video for you and send it this is also an easy fight so i can come back up whatever is it okay professor gary nolan thanks for having us back we&#x27;re here a week later very excitingly we we have parts of possible ufo crashes so what&#x27;s the background on what we&#x27;re looking at now okay the parts were a little anticlimactic and small but he claims to have much bigger parts that we can&#x27;t see due to national security sensitivities but let&#x27;s just take these three facts combined about the parts that are on the table number one observers with no real monetary incentive to lie claimed to see a vehicle that broke the bounds of our current understanding of aerospace limitations two the materials contain isotope ratios that do not exist naturally on earth and number three a top stanford microbiologist isn&#x27;t ruling out the fact that these parts could be of extraterrestrial origin given all that even though these pieces are small i think they should get you pretty excited and we now know that isotope ratios might have more to do with the properties of the material right themselves and the features and what the material can actually do in the physical world than we had previously thought right right correct the odd thing was that the other piece which supposedly came from the same event had exactly the correct isotope ratios as to what you would find on earth the material up front was what we would say in homogeneous or partially mixed it&#x27;s kind of like if you were to take chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream and then just do a little bit of a swirl you would see a mixture and we would call that inhomogeneous why would you mix some of these elements yeah there&#x27;s actually again no good reason there&#x27;s no metal that people normally make that have some of the mixtures that we&#x27;ve seen yeah that&#x27;s interesting that&#x27;s worthy of investigation yeah sure so that covers all of the anomalies about the pieces of magnesium coming from uvatuba but what about the other sample on the table those are pieces of bismuth nolan actually couldn&#x27;t recall how it was procured so we had to call hal put off to get the full scoop how hi hal dr hal puthoff has one of the most interesting careers of all time he was first a laser physicist and then out of stanford research institute he started the government&#x27;s psychic spy program since then he&#x27;s been doing frontier tech research and has briefed multiple presidents on ufos so do you know the original story of how it was kind of procured initially the story was that it was sent anonymously by someone claiming to be an army officer long story short this army officer was going through his grandfather&#x27;s archives when he found this rare sample and written in the diary was that it was a piece from roswell true or not these thin layers of bismuth magnesium are very hard to reproduce hal claims that they even have the properties to micro size wave guides for terahertz frequencies it turns out that it reduces the size of the required microwavable guide for terrorist frequencies down to about 1 30th of the wavelength which is which is amazing so it means you can basically put 30 wave guides in the volume of a single waveguide at terahertz frequencies got it thanks a lot i&#x27;ll really appreciate it what can you do with terahertz that we can&#x27;t with current well it&#x27;s just more packing more information pack in more information faster farther yeah terahertz is the next thing for communication that if we can get terahertz waves working efficiently there&#x27;s a whole slew of other electronic and radio communication uh things that can be done that can&#x27;t be done now shouldn&#x27;t there be things that we&#x27;re doing with these materials that show what environments they can sort of withstand or what possible properties they have is as well so like super high velocity you know like like uh literally like slingshotting them like as fast as you can you can or like putting them in super cold environments they&#x27;re super hot the trans medium thing making sure they don&#x27;t rust underwater because a lot of the uaps seem to submerge underwater and then come out of the water like basic things like that based on the observables you know i mean you could run electricity across them see if anything&#x27;s different are they conductors yeah are they insulators you know again this is why i think it&#x27;s important to get this kind of information out so that even a skeptic could suggest what should be done you know i mean there&#x27;s a number of people who who have them i get emails occasionally from people actually there&#x27;s one that i just got in the last few weeks an email from somebody who uh it&#x27;s a glowing object that drops molten metal i haven&#x27;t seen it yet i&#x27;ve just seen pictures of it got it so but it&#x27;s interesting enough that i&#x27;m actually going to follow through on that one yeah and this should be we should have some sort of standardized process exactly there&#x27;s like a flow chart that you could put together of what should be done and once you&#x27;ve got that process things just go in one end and come out the other and then you give it to the true believers and to the skeptics and let them fight with data rather than you know hearsay [Music] do you think if they&#x27;re hyper-intelligent aliens they&#x27;re aware that you&#x27;re looking into them i would presumably presumably but or they don&#x27;t care yeah or they say there&#x27;s nothing you&#x27;re going to be able to figure out about this yeah so we don&#x27;t care or it&#x27;s left behind almost as a you figure it out and you can have it you know the breadcrumb trail that&#x27;s what it feels like yeah last question for you roswell 1947. trinity that crash was 1945 where the sort of larger piece came from do you think that aliens are possibly interested in us uh splitting the atom so do you think they&#x27;re interested in not only nuclear power in our own possibly destruction of ourselves but figuring out the building blocks of uh base layer reality and so when we split the atom they become more interested and then maybe they&#x27;re interested in the fact that we&#x27;re figuring out our own genetic building blocks as well well i mean from their perspective let&#x27;s say a million years ahead of them they they know that we are maybe a few hundred years from you know spreading in our local galactic arm even if only by conventional craft do they want a bunch of angry monkeys running around with bombs you know they probably want to keep tabs on us right i would right you know i mean if i&#x27;ve got a neighbor yeah who is you know bristling with with armaments yeah and always cursing and throwing stuff around i might want to keep tabs on them yeah and we&#x27;re we&#x27;re a bunch of angry monkeys right now well dr nolan appreciate it this is awesome and i i hope we make real pro i hope we go through the step sequence of uh science that it takes to figure out what the hell these things are and what they do [Applause] watch more podcast
