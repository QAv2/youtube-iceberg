            <p>He says, &quot;I have a complex problem. Um, it&#x27;s the complex number I. It&#x27;s the square root of -1, which doesn&#x27;t exist, but it is used in so much math that predicts things accurately, including quantum. It fries my brain. I hope Neil and Grant can help me out.</p>
<p>Thanks.&quot; Yeah. So, so Grant, I&#x27;m going to lead off by saying, why did you label those numbers imaginary? My god, it&#x27;s the worst name in all. Worst name ever. Gaus proposed calling them lateral numbers, which would have been, you know, a little better. And then and then then you add another aspect to the imaginary number to get the complex</p>
