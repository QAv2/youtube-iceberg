            <p>EDUCATION TONIGHT AS WELL. BIG  DEVELOPMENT IN THE SEARCH FOR  THE TRUTH. ABOUT UFO&#x27;S. IT&#x27;S  BEEN MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE  THE WHISTLEBLOWER. THAT GUY  RIGHT THERE, DAVID GARAGE.</p>
<p>SAT  DOWN WITH NEWS NATION&#x27;S ROSS  CALLED HEART AND SHARED SOME  BIG REVELATIONS. WHEN YOU  QUESTION TRAVEL, MORE  TEAMMATE. THESE ARE RETRIEVING  NON-HUMAN ORIGIN, TECHNICAL  VEHICLES, YOU KNOW, COLLEGE  SPACECRAFT, IF YOU WILL, NOT  HUMAN SAW DECOR. JEN.  &gt;&gt; VEHICLES THAT LANDED OR  CRASHED.</p>
<p>WE HAVE SPACECRAFT  FROM ANOTHER SPECIES. WE DO.  &gt;&gt; THAT INTERVIEW CAUGHT THE  ATTENTION OF CONGRESS. MONTHS  LATER. GROSSE TESTIFIED ABOUT  HIS ALLEGATIONS AND NOW NEWS  NATION.</p>
<p>THE FIRST TO REPORT  TODAY THAT CRUSH. IS EXPECTED  TO SOON HEAD RIGHT BACK TO THE  CAPITOL. OUR JOE KHALIL WAS  THE ONE WHO BROKE THE STORY  TODAY. JOE KAY IN THE CAPITOL  HALLWAYS. YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT  HAVE A NEW VISITOR THERE FOR  THE NEXT 4 MONTHS OR SO.</p>
<p>DAVID  GARAGE. EXPLAIN WHY. YEAH,  THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. SO  WHAT THIS IS PROBABLY WORLD&#x27;S  MOST FAMOUS YOU AP UEFA  WHISTLEBLOWER. NOW YOU CAN  THROW CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER ON  HIS RESUME.</p>
<p>HE&#x27;S GOING TO BE  WORKING FOR CONGRESSMAN ERIC  BURLISON, A REPUBLICAN WHO&#x27;S  BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS.  A VERY BIG DEAL. BURLESON HAD  BEEN TRYING FOR SOME TIME TO  GET CRUSHED WORK WITH HIM. WHY  THIS IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE  YOU&#x27;VE GOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY  OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS IN THIS  SPACE, RIGHT? HAD HEARINGS  MULTIPLE. YOU&#x27;VE HAD PRIVATE  CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS.</p>
<p>LOT OF  LAWMAKERS SAY THEY DON&#x27;T KNOW  THE RIGHT QUESTIONS EVEN TO  ASK TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD  ON THIS PIC. RIGHT? SO  RUSSIA, SOMEONE WHO CAN CAN  GIVEN LINES OF INQUIRY CAN SAY  THESE ARE THE THREADS TO PULL  IT&#x27;S LIKE TO BE AN EMPLOYEE  FOR THAT, THOUGH. SO HE  TECHNICALLY CAN DO THIS IN  CERTAIN CAPACITY RIGHT? BUT  WHEN YOU&#x27;RE TALKING ABOUT  GETTING PEOPLE INTO A  CLASSIFIED SPACE OR SETTING,  THAT&#x27;S SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED  TO HAVE EITHER CLEARANCE FOR  OR THAT YOU NEED TO BE ON  STAFF IN SOME WAY. AND I&#x27;VE  ACTUALLY HEARD THAT THAT MAY  TRY. THEY MAY TRY TO INCREASE  HIS CLEARANCE NOW THAT HE IS A  CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER, THAT  ALSO IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT  OF THIS AND SOMETHING THAT,  YOU KNOW, HE HAS HAD THINGS  THAT HEAT HAS CLEARED.</p>
<p>BRUSH  HAS CLAIMED HE CANNOT SAY  PUBLICLY IF HIS CLEARANCE IS  HIGHER, IT&#x27;S POSSIBLE. HE SAYS  HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE  CERTAIN THINGS. SO LL OF THAT  IS SOMETHING WE&#x27;RE GOING TO BE  WON. AND I THINK IT&#x27;S  IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE, ERIC  BURLISON ISN&#x27;T JUST LIKE SOME  RANDOM CONGRESSMAN WHO SAYS,  OH, THAT&#x27;S KIND OF  INTERESTING. LET&#x27;S SEE IF I  CAN GET HIM TO WORK FOR ME.</p>
<p> HE&#x27;S ONE OF THE ORIGINAL ALONG  WITH TIM BURCHETT AND A  PULLING A LUNA JARED MOSKOWITZ  WHO HAVE BEEN ASKING A LOT OF  QUESTIONS HERE ON THE  MCITAUTCEUE S. </p>
