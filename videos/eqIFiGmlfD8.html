            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this is an educational Channel where we take a look at various theories of everything all-encompassing theories um Magnum opuses from obscure authors and other things that uh you might not know uh that would benefit your life if you heard about them but you probably haven&#x27;t because these things have been um suppressed or ignored or you know otherwise kept out of your school curriculum or even out of your uh media viewing and uh today is our 354th video that we&#x27;ve done on Dewey B Larson and his reciprocal system of theory and uh Mr Larsson was an engineer who lived in the 20th century and uh died in 1990 but not before he put out uh many books on uh matters of uh mostly science uh chemistry and physics and astronomy but also some economics um and uh some metaphysics uh including philosophy and religion and uh psychology and biology and uh then uh some of his followers have uh even extended his work into um other areas and uh some of them have revised larsson&#x27;s work slightly uh some of them I believe have stayed within the spirit of the reciprocal system and uh have done great work toward furthering um you know the long-term uh fortunes of the reciprocal system uh but uh this the future isn&#x27;t that bright there aren&#x27;t too many people who know anything about the reciprocal system in fact I have never met another person in person that has ever heard of the reciprocal system so it&#x27;s probably one of the reasons why I&#x27;m trying to put out these videos because I think it&#x27;s a great study and I think it&#x27;s a great Theory a system and um I&#x27;d like to get it out there so I can to have at least somebody to talk to and um the basic idea behind the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter not made out of energy or force or anything else but it is made entirely and exclusively out of motion in particular a kind of motion that Larson calls scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but it has no specific Direction uh a model for that would be a uh balloon with dots on it if you blow up the balloon all the dots are moving away from each other it&#x27;s analogous to the expansion of space all of the uh dots are moving away from each other further and further and further apart and the farther apart they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other uh but uh there&#x27;s no specific Direction attached to those movements until you arbitrarily decide that one of those dots is motionless and you assign it as the reference point once you do that then uh directions are imputed and um so so that means that the directions are not the result of the scalar motion but they are the result of the reference point and uh you know this is also seen in the clock the clock is always getting later and later and later but in no specific Direction and that&#x27;s kind of the key thing uh about the reciprocal system is that motion as defined by lson is the relationship between space and time and so we just looked at you know both the spatial and the temporal aspects of scalar motion the clock uh and we&#x27;ll be talking about that uh in more detail a little bit later but uh it&#x27;s what Larson calls clock time and clock space time is always getting later and later and later space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart but in no particular direction and this is kind of the um motion that uh Larson builds his Universe out of then there is also what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time this is a three-dimensionality um XYZ coordinates of space we&#x27;re accustomed to that thinking of space in terms of three dimensions volume and then also three dimensions of time because space and time are reciprocals of one another they do not exist separately they only exist together in motion um basically you can think of motion as a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the the denominator you can uh think of it kind of as a uh a ladder or something that uh you have steps on the ladder um the at the midpoint is one and uh as you go up the ladder or you could say to the right um You Go one one is the center then you go 2 3 4 five six and in the other direction in the negative so-called negative Direction you go from one to 1/ 12 1/3 1/4th 1 15th and 1 16 and so they balance each other out and time uh if you move in One Direction in terms of space then you have to move in the other direction in terms of time to balance it out so they always are going to multiply to be one so there is kind of a a a one just one place on that ladder where time and space are equal and that is when they are equal to one um and so when they are equal to one you have 1 over one equals 1 and for Larson he calls that unit speed now again the relationship between space and time is motion and so uh when you have one uh one unit of space in one unit of time you have uh a speed of one which is in larsson&#x27;s estimation that is the speed of light and he calls that unit speed 1 over 1 equal 1 now now when you move to the right you know then you have uh you know when you space moves to the right and it becomes two units then time moves to the left and it becomes 1/ half unit and um you know so you are I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not uh completely sure on this analogy at this point but um basically um when you have one over one you have unit speed if you move in either direction then you move into one sector or the other um lson calls these the material sector and the cosmic sector the material sector is the uh half of the universe that is moving slower than the speed of light and the cosmic sector is the sector that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light and uh the material sector is really the only sector that&#x27;s known by Legacy scientists um Einstein himself said that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe and uh therefore he&#x27;s excluding the entire Cosmic sector where the speed is um faster than the speed of light and uh um basically this all comes from what Larson calls the discrete unit postulate and so um space or time come only in uh discrete units you have to have a full unit of space and a a full unit of time to have anything um you you know if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of space you don&#x27;t have space if you don&#x27;t have a full unit of time you don&#x27;t have time and um now this this gets into a question that I&#x27;m having trouble with here with the uh you know the this number line uh thing that I was trying to work on here um you still have to you still have to have uh I I guess I would have to take back what I just said about um if you move one in one way on the other on the number line the other one moves the other way because that that um ignores the discrete unit postulate if you move one way on the line the other still stays at one um and so if you move uh to two uh you still have uh you have a speed of two 2 over one um I think that uh and then if you move uh in the direction of 1/2 well that&#x27;s 1/2 in terms of space but it is two in terms of time um that&#x27;s how I would think of it um but that might be uh something that we would look into later um the basic idea is that you know there&#x27;s a boundary in this universe which is the speed of light and that boundary is between the material and the cosmic sectors and you have a material sector where you have atoms um and particles and molecules and you also have Cosmic atoms and molecules and particles on the other side of the boundary um and uh those are known by science as antimatter and if you um they are identical the material sector and the cosmic sector are the same they are reciprocals of one another except that you have to reverse the roles of space and time so in the material sector you have coordinate space three dimensions of space and you have clock time the clock is always getting later and later and later but in the cosmic sector you have coordinate time three dimensions of time and clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart okay that that&#x27;s basically larsson&#x27;s first postulate um universe is made entirely out of scalar motion which comes in three dimensions in discrete units and has two reciprocal aspect space and time and U then his second postulate he only has two two physical postulates and that is the universe is made out of um with the universe conforms to the relations of ordinary mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is well first uh Larson says its geometry is ukian but uh Dr Bruce pret one of his revisers uh says that the geometry is projective and uh we are going to be looking at uh one of the articles that was written by Dr Bruce pet here uh that&#x27;s called the dimensions and displacements and I started this article a couple days ago so this is the third installment so if you want to go back to the beginning you probably want to go back two videos but we are about to start on a um section of this paper that is called the concept of the clock so this is going to get into this idea of scalar motion the concept of the clock in a universe of motion everything is motion and that includes the clock granted conventional thinking says the clock is just time but with two sectors of motion there are also two aspects of the clock clock time and clock space taking together the relation of space to time or time to space is motion so the clock is motion with aspects of space and time just like any other Motion in the reciprocal system where the confusion comes in is what the clock represents if we examine how we use clock time it is normally in relationship to either duration or speed it took 5 hours to unload that truck or that car is going 45 milph down the road in both cases time is related to space moving boxes a distance for a specific duration of time or a distance uh per a duration the clock is therefore the standard device we use to measure change or as Larson would put it the datm of measurement the only amount I&#x27;m sorry the only datum in the reciprocal system that is that of unit speed from which all motion is measured it is from this unit motion datm that displacements are made to create structure but the default at rest condition of the universe is to move at unit speed the speed of light lson refers to this motion as the progression of the natural reference system so in larsson&#x27;s um progression of the natural reference system this is always occurring this is the background Ro uh motion of the universe this is the at rest position of the universe so in a universe of motion we always have motion and it is the background uh and the state of rest of uh the origin The Ether the reference point the reference system um and um the natural datum and uh you know that makes sense uh in a universe of motion there is always motion and uh that motion can be modified through displacement this unit speed is what we call the clock our datm of measurement a common misunderstanding is that the progression uh the expansion of the Universe moves with the tick of the clock in both space and time this is incorrect the progression is the tick that moves everything else because the progression does not move relative to itself it stays fixed like the end of a tape measure each discrete unit of the progression is a tick of the clock when we make use of clock functions we normalize that aspect clock time or clock space that simply means that we take a ratio like driving 300 miles in 5 hours and reduce the denominator to Unity 300 mil in 5 hours is normalized to 60 M hour a speed it took you 6 hours to write three book reports then you are working at a rate of 2 hours per report we then use these normalized rates to predict future events if you had 10 book reports to write at two hours per report then you&#x27;re looking at 20 hours of work in many scientific applications the normalized component the denominator of a ratio of motion is just ignored because it is Unity the ratio of s over one simply becomes s a distance rather than a speed when examining conventional scientific processes keep a w watchful eye out for this Omission now when you&#x27;re talking about uh discrete units you know um one the n natural unit of space is 4.56 * 10us 8 m and the natural unit of time is 1.56 1.52 * 10- 16 seconds so those are the discrete units you have to have a full unit in order to have anything and if you have one unit of space in one unit of time you have the speed of light all other uh scientific quantities ities are also relations between space and time or time and space but they you know time and space can come in multiple dimensions and so you can have relations such as acceleration which is space over time to the second power or Force which is time over space to the second power or you can even go all the way up to matter matter is time the third power over space to the third power or even d density time to the thir power over space to the 6th power because density is mass over volume uh so you have time to the thir power over space to the thir power over space to the thir power mass per volume density so it kind of works like that and uh it works as a great check on your system uh to see if you&#x27;ve done your um you know done your equation corre correctly if your equation is dimensionally consistent because you&#x27;re only using two uh variables here time and space as opposed to like the MKS system where you have time space and mass here you get rid of the mass and that gets rid of 98% of the confusion okay this section here is called displacements a displacement is a measurement of how much something changed from a known point in the reciprocal system that point is unit speed the speed of light the notation for particles and atoms use the notation for particles and atoms use displacements rather than the ratio of speed because it is actually that displacement or the Delta that defines the atomic properties displacements are simply the difference in one aspect of motion from Unity so uh if you want to have a two temporal displacement you basically have um you know you start with um unit speed one over one and you move two units in one in a direction from that number line on that number line so a displacement of two uh would be moving you know from one to two to three that would be three that would be a spatial displacement of two if you move in the other direction you&#x27;re moving in the temporal direction and you would move from from 1 over 1 to 1 over 2 and then to 1 over 3 so 1/3 would be two units of uh temporal displacement so that&#x27;s how you are measuring you&#x27;re measuring from that reference point that 1 over one unit speed reference point is it plus or minus that if it&#x27;s plus you&#x27;re moving in the space IAL direction if it&#x27;s minus you&#x27;re moving in the temporal Direction and then you have to count off how many steps on the rung of the ladder or the number line that you are moving and you only can move in a discrete uh number of steps you can&#x27;t move four and a half steps or 3.6 steps you&#x27;re only moving integers 1 2 3 4 and and um you know so if you are moving a temporal displacement of four you move from 1 over 1 to 1 over two to 1 over 3 to 1 over 4 to 1 over 5 that is a temporal displacement of four to get from 1 over 1 to 1 over5 a displacement can either be in space or in time in the reciprocal system a spatial displacement is distinguished from a temporal one by placing the number in parentheses like an accountant would for a negative number so two would be a temporal uh displacement of two speed of 1/3 as compared to uh 1 over one and two in a uh in Brackets or in parentheses would be a spatial displacement um and there it would be a speed of 3 over one it seems like it would be the back the reverse of that but uh I think that&#x27;s not really that important um okay um I think we&#x27;re going to leave it off here the next section he&#x27;s going to get into Atomic rotations and uh you know kind of that&#x27;s that&#x27;ll be the end of this paper uh the last little part here uh where he&#x27;s talking about Atomic rotation and how this uh system fits into larsson&#x27;s formulation of the periodic table okay well um sorry for some of the confusion there um you know I&#x27;m learning this at the same time you are I just have a little bit of a head start or in some cases a lot of a head start but maybe uh you know I&#x27;m a little bit remedial on this and some of the concepts don&#x27;t stick but basically uh that number line concept is correct but you only move in One Direction you don&#x27;t move in two directions um and um you you know the uh the basics of the reciprocal system are that you know the basic way to learn it is that you have to uh basically suspend your disbelief because he&#x27;s going to hit you with a lot of Concepts that are foreign a lot of Concepts that you could debunk circularly if you U you know um mobilized your uh scientific knowled so-called knowledge that you got from high school or college science and or graduate school level science and uh if you&#x27;re assuming that those are correct you can easily you know refute the re reciprocal system uh based on that circularity but if you are really coming to it with an open mind then you have to kind of check that at the door and you can refer to it later but you need to get the whole picture of LaRon structure before you start uh rejecting things so you have to suspend disbelief long enough to at least uh give the reciprocal system a proper hearing okay well have a great day okay thanks for tuning in</p>
