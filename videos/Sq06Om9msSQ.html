            <p>the internet started saying that NASA completed the test and didn&#x27;t see anything. So, nobody wanted to put no more money into it, but we never completed the test. We never did the test. Yeah. And and so and and everybody who has ever claimed to do the test, and I&#x27;ve read their paper, never did the test to the degree that these papers talk about.</p>
<p>They they would either have have too low voltage, too small a superconductor, not not a two-layer superconductor. There&#x27;s always something not right in all those experiment. In fact, most of them were done with like 2in disc or smaller and athlete did didn&#x27;t say said he had a 4 inch, but it was just two layer. I mean, it wasn&#x27;t two layer. It wasn&#x27;t two layer.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t believe he went up to the high enough voltages. I could be wrong about that, but I don&#x27;t. by dying. Uh he he was the closest person to doing the test, but it still wasn&#x27;t the test described in the</p>
