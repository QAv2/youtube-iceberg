            <p>One adjustment that is okay during BFCM is on budgets. Let&#x27;s say that your budgets just end up getting spent and at target and you&#x27;re like whoa and so you&#x27;re maxing out your budgets. That&#x27;s the only thing I would say is you definitely if you&#x27;re spending more than 50% of your budget on any given campaign, go raise those budgets some more. Obviously, we&#x27;re trying to get as much spend out as possible against our targets here. And so, you know, lifting budgets, don&#x27;t lower budgets.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no point in lowering the budget.</p>
