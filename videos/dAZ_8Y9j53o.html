good evening everyone i&#x27;m going to speak about tom bearden&#x27;s scalar wave tech and i just want to mention you can go to my website it&#x27;s intellect.com int alek.com and uh if you click under the active vacuum link it&#x27;ll take you to some tom bearden uh videos and tom is uh i would say a pioneer you know free energy anti-gravity technology and um i went to his conference oh way back in 19 i think it was 1997. ever since then i&#x27;ve been hooked in the field here um tom always presents a fascinating lecture and you&#x27;ll see that you know if you just play as videos you play some variant well he brings up some very interesting topics and we&#x27;re going to cover that tonight in this lecture so um without further ado here let&#x27;s let&#x27;s get to the second slide now the fundamental basis of tom&#x27;s technology is this q cross q and you find this in coulomb&#x27;s law q squared and i remember in college here working with coulomb&#x27;s law and some of my physics and engineering courses and um you know i never saw this q cross cue before being applied to coulomb&#x27;s law this is only lately that that i&#x27;ve seen it in you know on some of the websites here but this q cross queue is the fundamental principle behind uh tom bearden&#x27;s work and the work of many others out there and i&#x27;ll touch on that a little later in this lecture but this q cross q it&#x27;s two opposing vectors and it brings up this what&#x27;s called the law of of the squares or the magic the magic boxes and uh you&#x27;ll find that uh on the internet as well and uh recently here i believe was last year a movie was made um called tenet t-e-n-e-t and they addressed technology that was not only tying forward which is our universe but also addressed the issue of time reversal and tom spoke quite a bit about time reversal in his lectures so that&#x27;s really all part of this this kind of technology because it works down at the quantum level and this is revolutionary work here i mean there&#x27;s just no doubt about it because working with q cross q and tom mentioned it and you know i&#x27;ll get to it a little later here but tom always said in his lectures that matter um it&#x27;s very much a part of this uh this q cross q principle so again i want to emphasize that you know i&#x27;ll get to it a little later here in detail because i make a very fascinating link with um quantum mechanics okay quantum field theory and and so let&#x27;s go to the second slide here so see what you want to do is operate q cross q in a resonance circuit and this is where you see this scalar wave emerge out of resonance okay and what i&#x27;m speaking about here is the transformer coupled to a capacitor and just looking at that when you put this on a scope you can find a fundamental resonant frequency and at that frequency the scalar wave emerges out of that and we&#x27;ll find out what that&#x27;s all about here in this lecture as well okay so let&#x27;s go to the second slide okay this is my scalar wave test bench and it consists of a tektronix oscilloscope and the one you want to get is this 2025b i i believe that&#x27;s the part number of it and the reason why you want that one is that you want to work with isolated channels you don&#x27;t want to have a scope that has a common ground you want each channel isolated from the other channel okay and that&#x27;s what this particular scope has so this is the kind of scope you want to get an isolated channel oscilloscope and tektronix makes probably one of the best okay so in front of that i have my test apparatus here which is my transformer and if you go to my website intellect.com you&#x27;ll see that i have a patent on this transformer and it&#x27;s connected to a uh re a capacitor the output of the transform is connected to a capacitor and that sets up the resonating circuit and so the input to the transformer is being driven by this programmable ac dc power supply and what you want to do is the ac part of this and uh this this particular power supply here can run your frequencies uh within that within the operating range of this transformer i believe it&#x27;s from uh somewhere around a kilohertz all the way down to 40 hertz so it gives you a very nice range to play with here and uh the particular voltage that i&#x27;m working at is uh eight volts of fairly low voltage and it sets up a resonance uh within this network here okay so um the input and output i measure voltages on the input uh the current i use these uh tektronix amp probes you can get those uh from tektronix as well um and there&#x27;s also set up on the input and output so what i&#x27;m doing here is measuring what&#x27;s called volt amps okay it&#x27;s as if you hooked up a voltmeter and a current meter okay on on the input and output side and what you&#x27;re going to measure are volt amps and i want to emphasize that because what i do with this scope is that it reads the voltams and then i read it into some special software that i wrote and i&#x27;ll go into some detail about that as well uh in this lecture and i&#x27;ll show you all the mathematical operations that it performs here just by reading the volt amps and then the scope also determines uh it multiplies the volt times the amps and it gives you what is generally referred to as real power on the scope tracing and i read that into the software as well and so from all that from from this information here i&#x27;m able to calculate what the phase shift is between the volts and the amps for the input as well as the output now since we&#x27;re not applying a load okay to the output of this the only load is the capacitor the phase shift is always going to be right around 90 degrees okay with the when you read the volt amps but the volts enhance will be quite high okay there&#x27;s uh you can do a multiplication on this which is what i do and you&#x27;ll see uh the volt amps is very high on the output compared to what the input reads but uh but again we&#x27;ll get into that a little later here okay so what you&#x27;re looking at here in this photo is the test bench uh to the left is my laptop computer that runs the software that i wrote and incidentally i wrote this the software using visual basic version 6 that runs on an old xp system that i have running here and it&#x27;s a very stable platform i never had any uh troubles uh with writing software because really all that i&#x27;m doing is just interrogating the scope using an rs232 through a usb port i&#x27;m just reading values from the scope and the software is performing these calculations okay so uh this this is this test bench set up here and i call the software transformer efficiency calculator okay so let&#x27;s go to the next slide okay how to make a scalar wave this always puzzled me exactly what tom beard was talking about you know in his lectures and he did go into detail in his early lectures here um about what to look for and he and he would say things like any competent lab can do this well it&#x27;s okay but what do you do and tom during one lecture i mean what do i do with this stuff tom and he turned to me one day at one of these conferences i think it was the psychotronics lecture he turned to me and he said don&#x27;t ever ask me that question again and i was just i was blown away it&#x27;s like oh all i&#x27;m asking is you know how how did he make these measurements you know and so tom is quite quite a character there so it only took me about 20 years to figure this thing out you know what this guy was talking about but he but again you know he goes into some detail in his lectures and he kind of have to put the whole thing together and it takes time to do that but you can do it and you begin with this q cross q component now if you take this device but here&#x27;s the interesting thing about this device if you take this device and put it on a profs a professor&#x27;s desk he&#x27;s going to be clueless he&#x27;s not going to understand what this q cross queue means because he&#x27;s been trained in classical physics all right the problem is and this is what tom bearden identified is that you have to go before the maxwell equations were simplified by oliver heavyside you have to go before that and so what maxwell worked with originally were what are called quaternion equations and he developed the whole mathematics uh behind this in quaternion math for doing um these these kind of calculations and what&#x27;s so intriguing about that is that the original equations are the correct interpretation of electromagnetics it&#x27;s correct because i see it on the oscilloscope it&#x27;s plain as day you see the scalar wave component that tom spoke about but the thing is that in classical physics when they optimized the uh the electro magnetics is that they remove the scalar component okay to do the simplification you throw away the baby out with the bath water here you just throw all that away and you&#x27;re left with a simplified version of electromagnetics which is just ac ac waves and the problem with that is that when you you cannot make the link between these ac waves and gravity because gravity is more of a scalar function you know it has these scalar properties associated with it but in electromagnetics there is no scalar components when you analyze it in the classical form okay so we&#x27;re going to look at that now tom bearden said in his lectures matter is made of trapped electromagnetic energy which is true that is true and i&#x27;m going to show that to you okay so let&#x27;s go to the next slide here okay so how to determine resonance well we just have a resonant circuit we have the output of this split flux transformer it&#x27;s the output stage and what you see is that we have two coils two output coils uh secondary one and secondary two and they&#x27;re set up to sum the voltages uh sum up but the current okay which produces the flux inside this core material here is set up in an opposing action and you have to have this opposing action if you&#x27;re going to do scalar wave technology you have to have this and we know uh other uh researchers like nikola tesla stanley myers a few others set up a posing flux action in their devices and this is what gets you the scalar function this is what you need to do gravitational connections here with this because really you can do gravity it&#x27;s my understanding according to tom that you can do gravity with the original quaternion mathematics that maxwell had because of that scalar component okay so um i mentioned before that on my test bench i have this programmable ac dc supply and it&#x27;s set up to deliver an ac power signal to the transformer and when you get this resonant circuitry here running you&#x27;ll find out that the point of resonance okay with the capacitor and the inductance okay of this uh the split flux transformer here has a resonating point okay and you can find that very easily okay using this programmable power supply and so when you&#x27;re at this resonant point you&#x27;re with minimum input current that drives this whole system here okay minimum input current is your point of resonance okay so let&#x27;s uh go to the next slide all right now tom likes to use this something called a pump to phase conjugate mirror it&#x27;s like what is that and this is what happens when you set up a pumping system in this secondary side of this transformer because what you have are is is a converging flux path okay in your material and the convergence is produced by these two output coils and ideally you would want these coils to be balanced okay as close as possible so you got to be able to be able to uh tweak uh the inductance level on these coils such that they perfectly match but you know for the sake of discussion here i&#x27;m just using my output coil arrangement here now tommy spoke about this pump phase conjugate and this this phenomena occurs when you have this pumping action going on okay in this in the output section here now back in december of 2020 i filed a patent on this as well and of course tom bearden lectured on this subject quite a bit back in the late 1990s early 2000s and uh it&#x27;s called this pcm resonator okay but he didn&#x27;t really tell you how to how to really do this okay it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like tom bearden&#x27;s trade secret okay and he shared it with uh john bedini uh those two worked together and back in the 80s is when floyd sweet had a device similar to this as well okay so let&#x27;s go to the next slide here and this is really from a slide that tom beard presented that you set up these converging waves wave one and wave two and of course this is my output coils and the input is really driven by the input side here and so the output is where you get this what tom referred to as a phase conjugate it&#x27;s a time reverse wave and this phenomena is an electromagnetic phenomena that occurs uh mainly in optics you&#x27;ll find this arrangement in in optics now you also find it here um okay with this uh colliding converging waves and it produces the scalar function okay and we&#x27;ll get to that here as well and the way that i look at it the question is is it a phase conjugate or is it just a reactive wave which is a good question okay pcm resonator is the pcm wave function and according to tom um it produces a time reverse replica wave and this is this would be uh i observed this on the input side of the transformer but you also get it occurring on the output as well okay so let&#x27;s go to the next slide here okay um examples of pcm resonators uh nikola tesla and his magnifying transmitter he used converging flux you know in his transformer device of the floyd sweet device used as well stanley myers his water car a very good example of it uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in stanley myers patents you can find that on the internet as well um in my split flux transformer set up the convergence and you also find this in metamaterial resonators um there&#x27;s another researcher by the name of uh i think it&#x27;s david paris he gave a lecture on apec uh a couple of weeks ago and this is where he sets up his wave patterns that converge in his meta material which is just um they&#x27;re just circuit boards with a pattern where it sets up a resonance in this pattern of converging fields and i know john hutchison uh uses technology as well john um you can find that on the internet john hutchison levitated a 90 pound bowling ball i mean that&#x27;s just absolutely amazing okay this levitation of very heavy objects just using these converging wave patterns okay so let&#x27;s go on to the next slide here okay now you&#x27;ll find this video i was just watching it the other day and you know i&#x27;m looking at his equations here and i said oh my god there it is there&#x27;s the scalar wave there&#x27;s a scalar wave in quantum field theory and i was just stunned to see this and and where you find this is that this is towards the end of this lecture this fellow gave you can look up relativistic quantum field theory find the youtube version and just watch it okay and towards the end of the lecture you know he&#x27;s asking the question you know what is a particle what is it and and of course tom tom bearden always said that well matter is just trapped electromagnetic energy and so here it is here is the scalar wave component you&#x27;ll see that particles with mass okay it&#x27;s very important here particles and mass have this function and if you look at what this is equal to you&#x27;ll see a negative 2 pi f min squared all right and when i saw that i said well lo and behold there it is that&#x27;s your scalar component and so uh and so what what is this that your crew that&#x27;s your q cross q component here okay because what this frequency is if you&#x27;re using sine waves you&#x27;re going to have the sine squared term and this is your scalar wave component so we&#x27;ll take a look at what that is here so yeah in in quantum field theory you have the scalar wave component which is critical for creating mass in a particle and of course you know quantum physics you know they have to have well you got a higgs field you got this field you got that field and um you know we really can&#x27;t connect them all together yet but nevertheless there it is and uh you know i&#x27;m looking at it and said well that&#x27;s a scalar wave term okay that&#x27;s your crew your q cross q component inside this wave equation for particles with mass and so there&#x27;s your trapped electromagnetic energy right there okay and massless particles you know like photons well there is no mass okay with a photon so that side is going to be zero okay so let&#x27;s go on to the next slide here okay so what is this mathematics that tom was talking about okay and it&#x27;s this quaternion the scalar quaternion solution which is really the heart of tom beard and scalar wave theory and so you know like i said before it&#x27;s based on q cross q and so if you looked at the classical solution to this you&#x27;ll discover that there is no scalar component with classical electromagnetics it&#x27;s gone okay q cross q equals the zero vector case closed so if you put this on any professor&#x27;s desk they&#x27;re not going to know anything about the scalar wave theory that tom spoke about you have to go earlier to the quaternion math solution here which is the original maxwell electromagnetics and there it is there&#x27;s your scalar component okay and so what you have is a scalar in a entity your q cross q equals the scalar entity plus the zero vector which is what you have from the from the reduced classical equation and so the scalar entity is what we&#x27;re going to focus on and so we&#x27;re using sine waves so you&#x27;re going to have sine omega t all right and so you let q equals a times sine omega t all right and so when you do your q cross q your cross product you discover that you have a squared times sine squared times omega t plus the zero vector okay the zero vector is what tom referred to as your vacuum engine it&#x27;s what holds matter together and so inside this bubble so to speak is that you have these two oscillating waves that are counter rotating with one another electromagnetic waves counter rotating creating the sine squared term and so what does the sine squared term look like all right and this is this is the fascinating part because tom referred to the scalar wave pump wave is a local gravitational wave and so what does he mean by that so let&#x27;s go to the next slide here and so i i took these equations and then modeled them using the software called mathcad and so i took a sine wave and then i took a sine squared sine wave and there&#x27;s your scalar waveform which appears at resonance and so there it is it has this offset it&#x27;s like a dc offset that is your scalar waveform that tom is referring to and so the input into your transformer is going to have your sine function okay you&#x27;re feeding a sine wave voltage and the transformer is using a sine wave current okay but this reflected component that comes back is a scalar wave that is added it&#x27;s a current okay and this current that&#x27;s being produced by this transformer is adding to the input side of the current being supplied to the transformer from the power supply so what you end up with is this sign let&#x27;s say this input waveform is the current coming from the power supply and the current coming from the transformer is your scalar waveform the two add up and you get this third waveform that looks like this okay the summation of your input sine wave and scalar waveforms okay this is your sign see the scalar waveform is your sine squared term which has this dc offset to it that your gravity wave this is gravity here okay this is what gravity waves look like right here the scalar waveform but electromagnetics looks like the top waveform ac pure ac okay and so you sum up the two and you get this input plus a scalar waveform okay next slide and so what do we see on the scope well there it is lo and behold the blue trace that you see here is your input current which is the sine wave plus the sine squared scalar waveform okay coming from this converging waveforms inside the transformer and it&#x27;s producing the same pattern okay so if you look at the two here and there they are you look at the third waveform here and the second is basically the same type of wave okay so this is what&#x27;s coming from the split flux transformer as well as tom bearden&#x27;s device you know when he came out with his patents i think around 2000 2001 the meg device meg the meg device and so this is what we see okay next slide okay so you know how do we analyze uh these circuits because you know we&#x27;re dealing with volt amps and when you hook up meters you know rather than using the oscilloscope let&#x27;s say you just had some meters laying around so you had a voltage meter and a current meter you&#x27;d read volts and amps okay but the thing is is that there&#x27;s a phase shift associated with these signals because they&#x27;re ac signals and it&#x27;s important to know what that phase shift is because if you were to drive a load here on the output of this transformer you can only read real power from a resistor that heats up you can&#x27;t read you know volt amps because what&#x27;s going to happen is that this resistor here is going to force that that phase to start the shift to become real okay because that&#x27;s what a resistor dissipates is real power it doesn&#x27;t dissipate what is generally referred to as reactive power and that&#x27;s what you get with the volt amps so what you end up with on the right here is this triangle okay so the hypotenuse of this triangle is generally referred to as apparent power your volt amps so below that you have your real power which is in watts and then to the right of this triangle you have the reactive power okay which is generally referred to as vars v-a-r and so the hypotenuse of this triangle here is of course the apparent power and my software figures all that out okay figures out what fee is this angle okay between the real power and the apparent power it figures that phase angle out and i&#x27;ll show you the math behind that as well okay because when you dissipate power in a resistor it&#x27;s going to measure real power not the apparent power okay the real power and so when you see the input source power and the output load power there&#x27;s generally phase shifts in there okay and the math is uh that&#x27;s going to be performed here we&#x27;ll figure all that out okay and so ultimately we&#x27;re interested in the efficiency of what this transformer is operating at okay uh that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re interested in so these calculations that you see here where power equals volts times the amps times the cosine of v this is what uh we&#x27;re gonna figure that out okay and then for a resistive load uh you can have there&#x27;s a couple of ways of figuring that out as well you can look at the phase angle or you can just do a simple calculation of v squared over r okay which is what we show here is as well okay so let&#x27;s go on next slide okay so this is the software that i wrote uh it&#x27;s in visual basic uh transformer efficiency calculator it&#x27;s written in visual basic six which is which uh as i mentioned before is a very stable software package and so it performs all these math operations you know it gives me the uh the volt amps in and out of the transformer determines the apparent input power apparent output power there&#x27;s a multiplication here of a parent power multiplier here where it multiplies you know these volt dams and does a little division calculation also we have um there&#x27;s also power factor that that&#x27;s calculated as well i don&#x27;t show that here um because it&#x27;s really you know for these type of transformers the power factor really doesn&#x27;t mean that much okay but it is calculated and it does print it out here uh on the screen at the screen on the right here so what we&#x27;re interested in here is the phase angle uh transformer efficiency with both using the phase angle as well as the load resistor calculation so we go and figure that out and we see we have a tr a transformer here that&#x27;s operating about 90 percent which is quite good for a transformer under load now what&#x27;s so interesting about the split flux transformer is that as you load it down okay when you select the load resistor on the output um as you load the transformer down it becomes more efficient okay which is wait a minute you know if i take a conventional transformer as i load down that transformer it becomes more inefficient well these type of transformers where you set up this converging uh pattern here uh become more efficient as you load them down and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing here 90 efficiency that is pretty good for a transformer okay that is you load it down okay so let&#x27;s go on here okay so transformer efficiency calculator it&#x27;s doing all these math operations and what you see here it calculates apparent input power the real input power reactive power determines the phase angle and there&#x27;s a calculation for that using the arc cosine some square root operations it also does the parent output power the real output power it does the whole nine yards the proverbial nine yards here of uh telling me everything about this transformer so then it gives me what the apparent power multiplier is and what that efficiency is uh the phase of the transformer input as well as output uh what the phase efficiency is of the transformer with an applied load resistor and what that efficiency is as well so this is all the math operation that&#x27;s going on in this uh the software package that i wrote and uh early on here when i tested using a conventional transformer that had an efficiency you know if you&#x27;re something just off the shelf uh you&#x27;ll see that that transformer is about maybe 75 between 75 and 80 percent efficient okay and as you put it under load it becomes more inefficient okay but these transformers when you put them under a load to split flux they become more efficient okay under these loads which is just the op it has just the opposite effect and i and i thought that was rather fascinating okay so we covered all the math operations here okay so what this slide shows is a no load configuration okay and i&#x27;m operating this transformer i believe it&#x27;s at eight volts with various loads of capacitance and what you see is this power multiplier which is about you see that in the middle of the of the readout here which is the apparent power multiplier we see that under no load it could be 10 times and then when you start dropping the capacitance on this you start lowering um well the uh the frequency starts to increase okay so if you start with a high capacitance 400 microfarads okay you see that the input frequency is lowest and then as you start to drop the load capacitor in value okay you start to lower it the frequency starts going up but the apparent power multiplier also drops as well here so i thought that was rather interesting with this type of transformer so under a no load condition i&#x27;m showing basically what the apparent power multiplier is okay and so that is my lecture okay this is my lecture for this evening um i just wanted to show you know what the basics are uh of using this split flux transformer and showing you what this scalar wave is all about so what i&#x27;ll do here is go back to the original slide here where i showed the test bench okay and if you look at the center here the wave on this scope is that you&#x27;ll see this sine wave plus the sine squared term okay so it&#x27;s for real what tom was speaking about in his lectures about scalar waves it&#x27;s for real you know i replicated them here and of course what tom says any competent lab can do this and so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what i successfully done here was replicate tom&#x27;s scalar wave theory okay that he spoke about in his early lectures here so um steve that&#x27;s pretty much what i wanted to speak about tonight uh is to cover the scaler wave theory and of course seeing it in practice here as well and you&#x27;re gonna be at the conference this year right i&#x27;m hoping to i might have do a a gofundme um hopefully some people will email me and figure out how to uh support maybe support me uh to get me at the conference and uh i will show this you know how i will demonstrate you know what the scalar waves are um give a nice demo okay what uh tom was doing um 20 years ago you know in his lectures well i got to meet tom way back in 84 at our first tesla conference in colorado springs and uh he had a weird life training all along and all of a sudden he slips off and you know one direction he&#x27;s way off the other one but uh [Music] i love him i mean i think you know i love this stuff and everything but from believing that a lot of parents have it&#x27;s pretty solid you know i&#x27;m looking forward to the day we could do things now like yeah that&#x27;s what still he was talking about [Music] in perennial barriers to anything and it&#x27;s like be like a silver zone that would come like a city or something you know i know where they could use that right now but uh it&#x27;s not here yet at least uh [Music] to our knowledge yeah yeah but uh we have a comment here from uh join the technicians you might want to comment on that [Music] okay think outside the core where the scalar component of two intersecting zero vectors waves cancel and free space this compression used okay that sounds like a step number next year um for this for this kind of research and so uh to modulate an electric uh vector field can release extra power okay that sounds very interesting here um yeah this is uh what i&#x27;m planning on doing next here is setting up uh these multiple scalar components okay and seeing what the effect is there as well because uh that that&#x27;s what tom spoke about um are these uh converging scalar waves and so uh yeah this uh release extra power yeah that would be uh very interesting as well so that would be uh a next thing to look at okay with this just to take this to the next level well i just uh have a lot of issues books like um fertile ants you know and um and he was talking about the scale of weaponry you know uh that the uh he believed the soviets have uh-huh i think that they have their sharks doing it at this point if they even have it you know because a lot of times people claim they have stuff they really don&#x27;t have nothing yeah right which is why i&#x27;d rather have you at the conference bill because uh you know as you&#x27;re a hands-on type of guy uh-huh and uh a lot of the people out here though if you start getting into the stealing fields there&#x27;s no point in energy that [Music] you [Music] yeah well the uh you know i made the connection in this lecture okay with quantum field theory and i noticed that uh you know in this in this video presentation that you know for ordinary particles they had they seemed to produce a scalar wave component and so um you know they have this uh the sign squared term that also shows up in their mathematics and i don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re even aware of that okay because there&#x27;s really nothing there in classical physics that tells them what a scalar wave is okay you only find that you know in the kind of work that we do so really we&#x27;re you know we&#x27;re kind of the people that are leading the parade here here&#x27;s another question for you could this tech be integrating into commercial ev charging stations um i would say so because the transformer itself you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s opposite of the performance of a standard transformer so in other words as you draw more power um from from this type of transformer it becomes more efficient in its operation so in other words it&#x27;s going to run cooler not hotter like an ordinary transformer would so it has some very intriguing properties that i think are worth looking into okay well you know last week i did a a [Music] show on tesla&#x27;s car and my experience with free energy device and one of the aspects about it you know is that the um [Music] the alternator and the motor was both getting cold you know and was totally up to what you&#x27;d expect you know on our conventional circuit you know and this thing should never work anyway yeah and um i believe it was drawn uh we must have been working strictly with the scale and the battery itself because they had a dead battery you know to start with but that battery itself may have been like [Music] an international gateway or something you know along the transformation of the scalar into the convention i mean [Music] what car was it [Music] it wasn&#x27;t a car it wasn&#x27;t my circuit you know i just sent you a but i mean this thing which was crazy because you know the battery itself you know i thought it was going to blow up you know bubbling away and everything you know and um just changes to it also it went even faster we&#x27;ll put a load on it you know and you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see that yeah okay and here&#x27;s another comment [Music] right yeah yeah heat is a big issue with this um with the traditional technology okay even with um circuit chips you know as well and some of the work that i get into some quantum tunneling you know if you look at tunnel diodes you know for example they have this uh well the the classical analysis of a tunnel diode is that you have this negative slope associated with it and they call it negative resistance but personally i don&#x27;t call it negative resistance i call that negative energy okay you&#x27;re getting into negative energy so the part isn&#x27;t going to run hot in that region it&#x27;s going to run cold okay it&#x27;s not going to heat up you know as crazy you know as uh a traditional diode would so uh the idea here is to set up you know tunnel diodes you know it and and to get them to work perhaps in logic circuits as well okay to uh not only lower the operating temperature but it&#x27;s also increased the speed of the switching because one of the problems with tunnel diodes is that if they&#x27;re not properly compensated uh you get you can get these uh high very ultra high frequency components uh coming out of it they can go into this parasitic oscillation at these ultra gigahertz range so you get these very high frequency parts you know in this negative operating region so that could be a way to speed up switching okay in traditional um silicon technology or gallium arsenide it could be a way of speeding up the technology without throwing away um you know what what you know the infrastructure that you built up over the years okay to to be able to speed up this technology okay cross product place electric longitudinal uh transmission systems yes i uh tom spoke about another it&#x27;s like another form of electricity it&#x27;s like a longitudinal electricity i know um i think it&#x27;s eric dollard that speaks about that as well that you find out that you find in electrical transmission systems okay uh longitudinal electricity and that would be something to look in as well uh personally i haven&#x27;t seen anything like that um but uh you know i&#x27;m continuing uh with my research as well and uh yeah uh with with these phased antenna arrays um because i think david paris uh spoke about this as well but uh i i don&#x27;t think he really knows what a longitudinal wave is okay and so uh tom spoke about it eric dollar speaks about it um so it&#x27;d be something that&#x27;s worth trying here to learn more about okay space charge separation the high frequency noise okay you know if it becomes a nuisance in your electric circuit it could cause you know the device to go into this uh parasitic oscillation and that&#x27;s something that you&#x27;re always trying to avoid the thing is is that what&#x27;s happening um you know in these quantum diodes you know you&#x27;re getting this quantum tunneling effect and really all that that is is really a speeding up of the electron flow so the electrons are flowing much faster uh through that circuit is my understanding of the quantum tunneling plus there&#x27;s another force that&#x27;s acting on those electrons as they pass through the potential barrier um it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s another right angle force okay it&#x27;s another right angle force that is acting on this and that could be your longitudinal component okay that is acting in quantum tunneling and that would be something that&#x27;s worth researching as well well there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s no other questions i just like to remind everyone that come to our conference you know start a 30 discount uh i know uh things that do cost more out there we try to keep everybody&#x27;s expenses to a minimum we&#x27;ve got great hotel rates we throw some [Music] some food in the evening then we have to have a breakfast and here&#x27;s another question for you okay that&#x27;s where your extra power comes from okay yeah you need those high-speed shot key rectifiers with the gigahertz range capture the high frequency power yeah that&#x27;s something that um you know it&#x27;s a phenomena that i think occurs in in these tunnel diodes is that the electron flow speeds up and so uh you know if your circuit isn&#x27;t tuned properly you can get into this parasitic oscillation mode and you have to be able to compensate for that but yeah that&#x27;s uh something to look into and that&#x27;s where i think um you know this extra power comes in is that as you tunnel through the barrier you have this other force that&#x27;s acting on your electron flow but that force is at right angles okay there&#x27;s a slide in another presentation that i gave that looks into quantum tunneling and i show where this this right angle force acts on the electron flow negative resistors um replacing tonal diodes replace batteries altogether um negative resistors that um is a good question for batteries um a negative you know a good example of a negative resistor that i heard about is to use mercury okay and you probably heard about mercury and some of these other devices you know for example in fluorescent tubes because what happens in a fluorescent tube is that you have this avalanche effect that occurs and many years ago you know like 20 years ago there was some experimentation done and i think this is shown in some of my earlier lectures where i show a fluorescent tube and someone hooks it up to a transformer they operate it through a diode arrangement and it can self-charge it has a self-charging effect because it takes advantage of this negative resist or this negative energy range that you find in fluorescent tubes that contain mercury okay you probably heard this mercury being used and you know what would say the the glocky um uh device you know the german nazi bell um they say that used mercury and some of these other devices use mercury as well is that it exhibits uh this it has a negative energy region where the electron flow is accelerated greatly accelerated um you know in that in that negative energy region it&#x27;s an avalanche effect you&#x27;ll find a description of it in i think wikipedia they talk about the avalanche effect associated with mercury okay so uh what we&#x27;re looking for is a technology that exhibits the acceleration effect okay that that occurs with these electrons or another force that&#x27;s acting on the electron flow and we just take advantage of it and that would be you know your over unity technology there because that&#x27;s what you need is is an extra push um that&#x27;s occurring in the circuit and i think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening you know with the scalar wave technology as well because uh on my website what i replicated was the boyd bushman experiment and what&#x27;s so interesting about that experiment is that you can take two magnets two neodymium magnets and force them together in epoxy together and believe it or not you know i got a you know i played for a patent on that i mean it&#x27;s such a simple idea but yeah but the thing is that you take two magnets you force them together so you have to build a jig okay to to keep that stable because the force there is it&#x27;s crazy you know it&#x27;s really scary to work with neodymiums like that but you gotta epoxy them together and then bind them up and i did i replicated the drop test that um boyd bushman did when he was at lockheed and i found on the internet is that lockheed took that idea and they incorporated it into and to into a jet plane as some sort of a gravitational modification experiment i mean they did take that idea and take it a step further so lockheed is working with something like that where you work with these opposing magnetic forces okay and what that does is that okay traditional physics will tell you that uh you know you&#x27;re not really measuring a powerful field anymore you know it&#x27;s like the fields cancel case closed okay nothing here to look at anymore but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s really going on because when you take that magnet that&#x27;s been forced together and you drop it it falls at a different rate okay it doesn&#x27;t fall like you know if you set up a test rock okay you take a rock and you take these opposing magnets and you drop them now it&#x27;s hard to get them to drop at the same time but nevertheless if you do you&#x27;ll see that the opposing magnet field falls slower than the rock and i thought that was really fascinating because you&#x27;re changing the field energy of those magnets okay and that field energy is interacting with with gravity as well so so i think in the end here you know what you&#x27;re really more doing is working with changing uh the gravitational properties of materials using opposing magnetic forces and that&#x27;s what you find that&#x27;s what i found with the the bell device you know if you look at the belt the architecture of the bowel device their opposing magnetic fields and that supposedly disentangles uh the craft from the field around it okay you have this disentanglement occurring and so and and again you know it relates to the scalar field technology as well and what comes out of that is your sine squared term now of course with the dc magnet you don&#x27;t have any oscillation going down there but you&#x27;re dealing with electrons at a very fundamental level okay you know that you&#x27;re looking at the spin of those electrons okay you know how those waves are oscillating okay those two waves are oscillating what makes up an electron are basically two wave functions counter rotating and that&#x27;s what creates your scalar function and that creates mass okay what comes out of counter rotating fields is your sine squared term and that of course creates mass okay so you&#x27;re fluctuating you know we want to fluctuate the mass of this system modify the mass and how it interacts with gravity okay that that&#x27;s the objective here of this scalar wave technology is that ultimately we want to build you know starships okay using this type of technology and of course conventional physics you know they&#x27;re not going to know anything about this okay because you know scalar wait wait what the hell is a scalar wave okay you know they&#x27;re looking for ac waves where you can&#x27;t connect ac waves with gravity you just can&#x27;t do it okay but you can connect scalar waves okay how we make scalar waves using counter rotating systems to produce your sine squared term okay and that&#x27;s how you get into gravity manipulation so that that&#x27;s my understanding and how it relates to quantum field theory it&#x27;s right there it&#x27;s right the scalar wave is right there right in front of their face and they can&#x27;t see it so that that&#x27;s your classic physicist right there okay we have uh [Music] two more comments and then we&#x27;ll cut it off okay what&#x27;s here what&#x27;s coming up right behind it [Music] okay we have another question here uh i don&#x27;t know a question there&#x27;s a comment oh just a comment yeah then i have a comment right behind it uh-huh [Music] okay that&#x27;s probably you know with the avalanche effect okay that occurs with mercury and that&#x27;s where this you know the flow the avalanche effect is where you accelerate the electron flow okay in your in your system here well i guess we&#x27;ll call tonight though and uh thanks for being here yeah and uh and uh hope to see you there and uh in uh albuquerque i got a real reserve for you yeah if someone can dig into their pocket here and throw a few bucks this way uh roy and i can sure use it we can work our way to albuquerque here i would love to present and show this technology because uh the reason why because it&#x27;s for real and one more comment someone wants to know where they can purchase their software oh the software yes um i was thinking of making just making that available as a download okay yeah there&#x27;s a software section there and i&#x27;ll probably set it up as a download and in this lecture you see yeah right there uh go back a little bit well i think i said he can just contact you there right yeah yeah just go to the website yep yeah i&#x27;ll probably make it up as a as a free download and it works well with the with the tektronix scope it&#x27;s an old scope but it works great okay and you don&#x27;t want a scope that has a common ground at all you got to have these isolated channels and that&#x27;s what the scope is all about okay isolated channel scope and i just use the ordinary uh amp meters uh made by tektronix to measure the current you just measure voltages and current and this thing does all the math okay to figure it all out and then presents it in a nice format there&#x27;s even a button there that&#x27;ll take that that screen with all the data and send it to the clipboard okay and there&#x27;s some clipboard software out there that can take that clipboard and send it out to a file and you can build these nice little images or you can print it out do whatever you want with it and it&#x27;s just a really handy tool and i finally got that working uh just in the past couple of months here i originally had that software for about i started on it about maybe four years ago or so when i first first got the scope um i i started working on this software and i have vb6 you know on my old xp system here and the two work great together you know i have no problems with it it compiles very nicely and it&#x27;s a very stable piece of software okay and it works great with this tektronix scope takes a little while to read everything in but you know if i can get there you know i want to get there at the show and if you show up i&#x27;ll show it to you you know you can download it and um get one of those scopes yourself so uh yeah it&#x27;s the way to go with that well see y&#x27;all next week and talk to you later thanks for having me steve</p>
