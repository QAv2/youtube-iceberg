            <p>[Music] hi there my name is matthew carson with the open source energy network we&#x27;re very excited to be bringing these testimonies before you today but first of all we&#x27;d like to thank the disclosure project the disclosure project has spent a couple years and over a quarter million dollars acquiring these exceptional energy testimonies from trailblazers in the clean free renewable energy field these testimonies are testimonies they aren&#x27;t simply interviews they have been documented with affidavits and documented credentials these people have important things to say about the current state of energy as it is in the world today please listen carefully watch carefully share these videos disperse them amongst your friends email the links around but make sure to donate directly to the disclosure project today and keep in mind that these are not fictional interviews or show biz articles these are testimonies that we hope and the disclosure project hopes will eventually stand in a court of law thank you my name is tom bearden lieutenant colonel u.s army retired i spent 20 years a little more than that in the active military mostly in air defense various other assignments field artillery you know technical intelligence assignment liaison to canada to some technical work going on site in turbulent wakes and re-entry systems and so forth at the canadian armament research and development establishment and spent quite a number of tours in in basically r d work in the military developing missile systems and things like that for about uh 20 years or more some associates and i have been researching very heavily into trying to extract electromagnetic energy from the vacuum now we did so under somewhat duress because the conventional electrodynamics model does not allow this to happen in other words it doesn&#x27;t allow you to extract excess energy from the vacuum and use that to power your load so it doesn&#x27;t allow you to make a self-powering system so we took the approach that some of the phenomenology we had seen in experiments and so forth convinced us that it was possible and there didn&#x27;t seem to be any real physical reason why it couldn&#x27;t be extracted if we could find a way to do it but we had the problem of why doesn&#x27;t the electrodynamics allow it to be done so at the same time we also began a study of the foundations of electronics in other words what are the fundamental concepts that are assumed in the theory where did they come from and how did they get in there and that was turned out to be very interesting and very pertinent because electrodynamics kept getting modified and restricted is what kept happening to it the original theory that maxwell had was 20 equations and 20 unknowns quaternion type equations what we&#x27;ve done is the closed current loop circuit where all the carriers have the same mass per charge ratio all the buckets have the same weight so to speak anytime you build a circuit like that it&#x27;s quite easy to show that the amount of energy that circuit collects when we do this free regarding and we do increase its energy ever how much it collects it will then use precisely 50 percent of that to destroy the thing that let it do that and it&#x27;s really the dipole the source dipole it will use that to kill itself so to speak and have no more excess energy the other half will go out to the circuit and power the loads and losses that means less than half gets to the load well to restore that source dipole in other words so we can get some more energy in to use it costs just as much to restore it as was used to destroy it so we got to put in more than we can ever get out in the load with such a squarely circuit and that&#x27;s the only kind of circuit we&#x27;ve used in power systems since day one we&#x27;re still building them we&#x27;re still making power systems that deliberately kill them so we pay the power company to have a giant wrestling match inside this generator and lose that&#x27;s really what we pay them for so that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the way to run a railroad it would seem to be much more ideal to freely change the energy of the system pay a little switching cost so we get it switched over to the load and dump it in the load and let it go let it power the load and so you can do it so the problem we ran into was that the electrodynamics had actually been modified to throw out the very kind of systems that we had seen in our experiments evidence that could be done but violates the ordinary electrodynamics and we can do it and not violate conservation of energy we can do it in accord with thermodynamics and we can do it in accordance with physics and electromagnetics now this is absolutely rigorous i don&#x27;t care how many folks want to check that it will hold up it is rigorous so this was one thing we established from the study of the foundations of electromagnetics you are permitted to have electromagnetic systems to power themselves in their load and you don&#x27;t have to put in the energy they take it from the vacuum the active vacuum our engineers are taught to throw away about 10 trillion times for a typical average case as much energy as they pull out of the vacuum without even knowing it in a generator and a battery and it&#x27;s pouring out down the circuit and misses the circuit they throw all that away and only calculate the little bit that we catch in that circuit and then use now when we measure the circuit we obviously measure the energy being dissipated by the various pieces of that circuit well if the energy is being thrown out of there it had to get in there so obviously the measurements of the circuit will match poynting&#x27;s theory because it&#x27;ll match the energy that actually went in there to get dissipated like a country boy said you&#x27;ve got a pipe here so to speak and it&#x27;s got some holes in it if you measure all the water flowing out that&#x27;s how much water come in it now the whole river can be around it and missing the pipe and you won&#x27;t measure that so we have built a whole science based on throwing away this enormous energy that is pulled out of the vacuum by every little old separation of charges every dipole well in the 50s in 1950s particle physicists discovered wu and others discovered broken symmetry they discovered how fundamental a process something like this dipole is where we separate two two opposite kinds of charges and td lee for example looked at it for physical charges and so forth and lee won a nobel prize for it any dipole is a broken symmetry in the fierce exchange with a vacuum it&#x27;s a broken three-dimensional symmetry what does this mean cutting through all the words getting down to country boy language it means that nature does not insist on conserving energy in three dimensions we do because we have a three-dimensional mind we like to think in terms of space because observation itself destroys time and what we look at is spatial so we like to think the world is made of space not space-time however nature loves to work in four dimensions her fundamental law is conservation of energy must apply in four dimensions now you&#x27;re not going to beat that one so never think about that but there is no law of nature that requires you to come in and say also it must apply simultaneously in three dimensions if we build some gadget that makes it apply in three dimensions we apply an extra constraint on what nature will give us turning that around we go around building things that insist on having this three-dimensional exchange of energy we got to put it in in three dimensions for whatever we get out and lose some in the middle so we we&#x27;re we got a terrible situation all the way it&#x27;s called entropic engineering we always got entropy beating us to death never go over unity forget it lose a lot we talk about you know efficiencies at 30 percent and so forth for our power systems when we talk about burning the coal and all that stuff but nature doesn&#x27;t require you to do that all you have to do is break a little bit of this three cement symmetry set of chains where you have tied her feet to the floor once you break the flow in three dimensions you no longer have to conserve energy in three dimensions the basic conservation of energy is an inflow from four dimensions out flowing in three dimensions from the fourth dimension and converted and flowed out into three and that one is free giant neg entropy is free nature will start reorganizing a goodly percentage of the whole vacuum for you spreading at the speed of light and will continue it as long as you leave the dipole alone the original charges and dipoles in the original matter of the universe have been putting out energy and reorganizing the vacuum for 15 billion years today we&#x27;re said we can&#x27;t engineer neg entropy when neg entropy is the easiest thing in the world to engineer whereas entropy is the hard way to do it and that&#x27;s the way we all do it the bottom line of this is it will initiate the negative entropy and let it go it&#x27;s just like you punched a hole in the ground and you got a big gusher of oil you don&#x27;t have to furnish the pressure and you don&#x27;t have to furnish the oil here it comes and it comes out in real oil that you can use and the common dipole in every electrical circuit pours out energy in that fashion the problem is not how to get enormous energy from the vacuum that problem then totally solved it was actually solved in 1903 had we understood it had we understood what whitaker wrote we didn&#x27;t but now we do understand it and we do certify very rigorously with some of the ais papers that that is for real the problem now is how do we catch a goodly bit of this energy and use it asymmetrically you dump it in a load let it power that load and not use half of it to go back over and kill a little dipole so we set about then to build one that wasn&#x27;t built that way it&#x27;s been successful yes we have been successful uh we have just built our second model the first model produced five times out what we put in uh we pay for switching we don&#x27;t put any energy into it to actually power the system it comes right out of a permanent magnet the die which is a dipole the reason for using a permanent magnet is very simple you can pass the flux back in a flux channel back through the permanent magnet and those poles don&#x27;t get destroyed they are welded into the material when you magnetize it that&#x27;s not like little charges separated in electrical charges you knock the charges out and destroy the dipole so we can bypass one of the big problems with a permanent magnet we don&#x27;t have to destroy the dipole that gives us one solution going in the other is how do we catch the energy well that turned out to be fairly simple we found a material which will separate the magnetic field from what&#x27;s called a magnetic vector potential the vector potential flows unceasingly from the magnet it&#x27;ll flow from now for the next 15 billion years you can&#x27;t slow it down you can&#x27;t change as long as that magnet is there so you have plenty of energy flow the question is how to use it so we use it by diversion we reason that this flow will replenish us like a river it&#x27;s like a humongous river if we dip some energy out of it it&#x27;ll replenish the hole we dipped out of at the speed of light so for all practical purposes instantly so we can dip and dip and dip we have to pay to switch to do that but we can keep dipping and the water feels as fast as we dip it then if we come down to another area and we let the water that was replenished still interact with something and at the same time we dump the water that we we dipped in there we will have more energy by far than what we&#x27;re paying for dipping so we looked at it as an energy flow process which it is and we found the material which would do part of the dipping for us it will separate the magnetic field from the magnetic vector potential yes there is a history a long history of over unity systems what has happened to the uh for example nikola tesla had one uh basically his big magnifying transformer that he had in on long island was such an overunity system uh the way that one apparently worked is he got the entire earth itself in resonance the crust of the earth as you go down in there it&#x27;s made of highly non-linear materials particularly when you get down to the perovskite or whatever you call that stuff and it will act it in in the bulk even it will interact in a sort of a non-linear optics fashion it will do phase conjugation and so eventually what it what it does is everything going on as feeding energy into the earth starts to feed energy into that wave that it created so he gets a lot more energy in his resonant way fed from outside from the environment in the interior of the earth and that&#x27;s the way he built up a humongous wave of energy his idea was you could then put in a tap on it anywhere else on the world and extract it free and of course jp morgan&#x27;s take on that was that&#x27;s foolish you can&#x27;t put a meter on it so that actually doomed much of tesla&#x27;s career at that point when morgan found out that he tesla was going to produce the energy freely small cost here the central location everybody else could tap it for free it wouldn&#x27;t have powered the whole world today it would have powered much of the world in those days tesla also we&#x27;re pretty sure put a system in a car and ran a car on it and the reason we&#x27;re pretty sure is his nephew who wrote in the car with him is still alive and can describe the incident and how the engine had no gas no input of power and would still run once tesla got it started and we know it&#x27;s perfectly possible tesla apparently knew how to use this giant entropy process that&#x27;s universal energy&#x27;s free for the taking from the vacuum anywhere you want it we just have to learn to use that some of the breakthroughs in the past have been deliberately suppressed i will name a few t henry moray was inspired of course by tesla&#x27;s work and he demonstrated so many times to so many scientific and engineering groups and people who were skilled in the art there is absolutely no question that t henry moray had a system that produced 50 about 50 kilowatts out of a 55 pound box this is well established as you go back and look at all kind of certified tests and everything else that he did uh there&#x27;s a all kinds of skullduggery that happened there i don&#x27;t think t henry murray ever got a decent chance to ever do anything with that the uh the russians even tried to kidnap him at one time it reads like james bond movie but it&#x27;s real it really happened and it really happened here in the united states this was before the war it was in the 1930s the same general period of time one of the greatest electromagnetic fellows we ever had scientists was gabrielle crone gabriel crone invented a true negative resistor working on a navy contract for standard university he was never permitted to reveal the exact way that he constructed his negative resistor but i used direct quotes where he in fact said we have a negative resistor and we can disconnect the generator from this network analyzer when we got negative resistors in there because they will power the circuit so that one was in fact suppressed i don&#x27;t know whatever happened to it but it vanished and he never did reveal the secret of what he called his open path connecting any two points in a circuit but it is in the literature and is well documented because he was one of perhaps the leading electrical scientist in the united states at that time well there&#x27;s another one that went down the tube various and sundry people have made casual ones from time to time over the years i&#x27;d estimate probably 50 different inventors have made casually invented something even if they didn&#x27;t understand it they did get it to go over unity we&#x27;re never able to get anything done with it most of the time they uh incurred a lot of enmity from the scientific community sometimes we&#x27;re really hounded and sometimes we&#x27;re just very naive probably the best documented scientifically uh over unity systems self-running self-powering systems were developed by the russians before world war ii it&#x27;s in the french scientific literature and it&#x27;s also in the russian scientific literature the papers are there i quote them in many of the things that i published and you can go check the papers the theory is there many papers are published on this in the russian scientific literature they built what we call parametric oscillators they have an oscillator going and they change in the middle they switch the actual inductance or capacitance or both of the things so that it becomes a self-oscillation device and they reached you know goodly power for that those days 50 and 100 there are many ways of looking at uh the suppression that&#x27;s occurred in this area and certainly i do not wish to talk about it myself but i&#x27;ve been a victim of quite a bit of suppression so has any other legitimate researcher in this area all i can do is give you my ideas and from drawn from my own experiences and what i think it is and where i think it&#x27;s coming from today we don&#x27;t have so much big kingdoms today we have big economic programs big economic countries are basically we have cartels we have a whole set of cartels in an area interlocking corporations and behind this we have a few people who are quite wealthy and who own those things now the normal nature of the beast for very powerful empires let&#x27;s call that an empire it&#x27;s a corporate empire a set of corporations empires basically a cartel if historically as far back as you want to go we have had cartels any time we have a very powerful cartel or set of people that control a lot of things that resist any means of changing its inflow of control and its inflow of funds and money and its power you know everybody&#x27;s trying to be the big monkey it&#x27;s really as simple as that and so the more powerful the agency the more powerful the group the more powerful the cartel the more they will resort not only to legal means but to extra legal means to suppress their competition uh you know this is an openly known today for example the greatest espionage in the world is industrial espionage between one corporation and another right here in america they&#x27;re the ones that hire all the spies and the spooky equipment and everything like that by far more than that intel agents do so that&#x27;s one thing we have we have the giant industrial or really cartel economic cartels in in energy and it&#x27;s not one cartels there are many many groups in energy and each of those has become very powerful in its own area and each one does not wish to see simple little electrical taps pulling out enormous energy from the vacuum they would much rather see you burning a lot more oil and so forth so yes there&#x27;s uh in my view there is a very active uh suppression effort by those kinds of folks part of that goes into very unique areas they don&#x27;t do it so more so much it&#x27;s not totally mafia type stuff it&#x27;s not like you know you just flat get shot there&#x27;s some of that but one of the main ways of suppressing it is they take a deep psychological profile of an individual that they wish to suppress what it means is they really wish to get him entangled in all kinds of difficulties he can&#x27;t get out of now a good trait from a human being standpoint may be a very valuable trait to somebody who wishes to manipulate you for example suppose you&#x27;re easy to approach that&#x27;s a vulnerability that&#x27;s a serious vulnerability so one&#x27;s deep psychological profile is examined in great depth by real experts and any way that you can be gotten to where you&#x27;re naive you don&#x27;t have now who knows international finance you can be had on a money laundering scheme easily and not even recognize that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re in uh so any way that you do not have good knowledge or you do not have ability or you have a vulnerability they call them vulnerabilities then they arrange scenarios just like you would write a movie uh in fact they do it with computers all computerized and in this scenario we have we write a play where this particular vulnerability is going to be exploited in the target now they keep deep psychological profiles on lots of useful fellows these are people who basically have knee-jerk reactions or something or they&#x27;re radical or they have some kind of way they interact which if could be connected with you would be in the area we wish the interaction to occur to get you off into something else totally different what you&#x27;re doing so the next thing you know here all it takes to set that up may be a phone call and stimulate the interaction to occur and then the controllers sit back and watch the game go it&#x27;s gaming but it&#x27;s just like right watching a movie scenario uh one of these days would probably write a book on gaming and how it&#x27;s done and what kind of the main games they can use but i can tell you they&#x27;re very effective you can get so many different games from so many different walks of life by so many charming folks who are really oily characters that you would not believe it and those come at you in mass and usually they bury you they bury you off in the courts they bury you off they get you tricked into doing an illegal act how would they do that if you if you wouldn&#x27;t violate the law real simple how can you be made to violate the law when you&#x27;re not a criminal simple let me give you a for instance fellow comes in and he says you know we really need to get some real major financing every inventor is poor everybody&#x27;s struggling nobody&#x27;s got the money to build all these buildups which may cost 10 15 000 20 000 a piece so everybody&#x27;s struggling for money so he comes in and we&#x27;re going to raise this we&#x27;re going to form a stock company we&#x27;re going to do all these good things under noise to you he goes off to the securities exchange commission and several other people treasury department he says hey i think i have fallen in with the den of thieves of course he&#x27;s the ceo now i understand because he&#x27;s the guy who knows all this stuff and tell you what i&#x27;ll do if uh if you&#x27;ll give me immunity to prosecution i&#x27;ll help you catch these crooks because they&#x27;re going to do the greatest money laundering thing you&#x27;ve ever heard of it&#x27;s going to come right out one of these foreign countries going to be scrubbed and come in here to fund this effort it&#x27;s going to be laundered dope money or something like that you have no knowledge this is happening and they give him they jump at the chance they&#x27;ll give him the immunity to prosecution that&#x27;s their normal motors operendi they want to catch some crooks and this guy&#x27;s going to help him catch some crooks so then he goes off and sets all this up and keeps you deluded about what&#x27;s happening and you wind up in uh where the thing is going to be consummated somewhere and if you consummate it you wind up behind bars for about 20 years wondering how you got there when you never did anything to money launder anything he&#x27;s the fellow who did it and who set it up and he testifies against you because he&#x27;s immune to prosecution this is one of the standard games machiavellia is not dead he still lives and these are the games that are played and is particularly played in the the systems where people are trying to build over unity systems it&#x27;s been very effective in stopping some of them do you think lethal force has been used lethal force is used i worked with an inventor for example the sparky suite is quite well known and he was shot at once with a silenced rifle from about a sniper rifle from about 300 yards the only thing saved his life was he was an old guy and very feeble there towards that part of his life and he was stumbling as he coming up the steps and he fell down he just fell down on the steps caught his foot and fell right forward and as his head went forward the bullet went right by where his head was and of course the assassin was never found so there are many cases like that some are killed i believe uh marinoff i believe to be a kill i don&#x27;t believe maranov jumped off a building when he was excited on the way to to talk about his invention and so forth gave no indications of it if i can believe the reports of the people who visited where his body lay uh where his body lay on the pavement glowed and there&#x27;s only one weapon on earth that will kill a human body and leave where it lies on the cement let the cement glow under it and that&#x27;s a longitudinal wave shooter what&#x27;s called a shooter so i believe my personal belief i can&#x27;t prove this and according to law i don&#x27;t intend to try but my personal belief is that maranov was killed he was probably killed by either the kgb or one of their agents from one of the other iron current curtain countries killed with a shooter thrown off the building to make it look like suicide the police probably knew about it that&#x27;s why they let the body lay so long before they moved it they didn&#x27;t want to tangle with their longitudinal waves from it so yes there are some rather bizarre things that have occurred to some people uh as i say i prefer not to dwell on that try to get by as much of that as we can and try to dwell on the science the only way we&#x27;re ever going to beat all of this stuff we have to convince the scientific community that there&#x27;s real science here let me now review some of the implications of what i hope is just now emerging in these these energy systems where we take the energy from the vacuum turn it into normal electromagnetic energy and we catch it and use it to power our loads first of all every system we got out there has been doing this we just didn&#x27;t know it we thought the generator powered the external circuit it doesn&#x27;t it does not power it at all all it does is we twist the crank on the generator of the shaft to turn the shaft and that forms a magnetic field inside the generator and that energy in that magnetic field dissipates itself upon the internal charges to force the positive charges in one direction a negative charge another to make that dipole and that&#x27;s all the generator does it doesn&#x27;t add one watt to the power line all the coal all the oil all the dams ever built all the nuclear fuel rods ever consumed never added one single watt to the power line all they did was keep rebuilding the dipole that we have designed the silly circuit to destroy faster than we can power the loads not the way to run the railroad so we have polluted the planet we have just we&#x27;re killing species we&#x27;re poisoning our own lungs and our own environment we don&#x27;t have to do that but it&#x27;s a giant set of cartels it&#x27;s a giant financial set of empires and it&#x27;s going to continue this way unless we get the attention of the scientific community focused on it and hopefully get some legislative action focused to force the action to develop these kinds of systems now the implications once we develop them and start to use them first of all we don&#x27;t have to have all this nuclear look how expensive and how long it takes to build a nuclear power plant then all the radioactive waste you have you know they still store the fuel rods on the sites after they&#x27;re spent you know what to do with them so you&#x27;ve got all kind of schemes about where you&#x27;re going to put them the blunt truth of right now we&#x27;re storing them on site it&#x27;s a nuclear power plants uh the other thing is we don&#x27;t need to pollute with all these hydrocarbon byproducts we don&#x27;t need to pollute the whole biosphere like that we don&#x27;t have to burn all that stuff just to make a dipole quit destroying a dipole we don&#x27;t have to remake it so if we use the system where we extract it from the vacuum we can clean up this biosphere we can also right now one of the greatest critical things we have in my view the supply of oil is not lost but the supply of cheap oil has now peaked we are there what this means is we will continue to get some oil yes but it will be more and more and more expensive year by year by year meanwhile the demand for electricity goes up everywhere in the world which drives the oil curve again and what you have is the classic escalation of prices type situation the demand is up the supply is down the supply gets more and more expensive to try to fill it and so the costs just going to go up and up and they&#x27;re not going to stop well what happens somewhere along the line of about 2008 the way i look at it and project it we&#x27;re going to have a world economic collapse the economy cannot stand such increases as is going to come up and god help us if we have a war in the mid east nobody knows what maybe 2006 you know instead of 2008 but i believe by 2008 we will see the world economy collapse now about a year before that as the economies are crumbling not everything runs up in like a square wave collapses in one instant as they start to crumble and the stress on all these populations and all these leaders and all these nations are it increases so much desperate people will do anything desperate leaders particularly fanatical leaders will do anything what will happen is in their cli their conflicts will increase and escalate and they will start to use the weapons they have in those conflicts and there&#x27;s about 25 nations now according to the secretary of defense coin that have mass destruction weapons nuclear weapons for example for goodness sake if you don&#x27;t have nukes maybe you bought some surreptitious plutonium look at what will happen to your water supply in new york city put a little plutonium in it so all kinds of things people that are the poor nations that can&#x27;t afford nukes have biological weapons but about 25 and it&#x27;s growing all the time has weapons of mass destructions now by the way those weapons are already in our large populations if you will check colonel lunoff&#x27;s book colonel lunoff is uh the highest ranking gru defector we ever had and his books cleared by the cia so what i&#x27;m saying is cleared lunov tells you how the russians introduced the nuclear weapons surreptitiously into their operatives on the ground and secreted them in the u.s he tells you how it was done in the book so read the book all our big cities as far as i&#x27;m concerned and population centers already have weapons of mass destruction hidden in them we used to call that dead man fusing and so all the nations have dead man fused one another one way or another and all the old studies showed that in a heightened tension great conflicts and high tension whenever they start popping the nuclear weapons or the weapons of mass destruction you have a very formidable thing that happens to you nobody has defenses since we have no defenses the only thing you have is like a fencing duel you have to hit the enemy before he hits you you have to destroy him or you will be destroyed mutual assured destruction is a funny acronym the only thing that&#x27;s debatable about it is whether the destruction shall be mutual or uni unitary what happens is everybody fires on perception of preparation by his adversaries and you have to fire everything you have as fast as you can as rapidly as you can as massively as you can to try to destroy your enemy otherwise you have no chance of survival so what we get is the great armageddon everybody&#x27;s been dreading the energy crisis going right now in my view will probably evoke a great armageddon that we&#x27;ve all feared so long in about 2007 if we don&#x27;t solve the crisis because of the what i view as the stress that i view this as the greatest strategic threat to survival of the united states and in fact of civilization itself that has ever existed in my lifetime now the fools may blow the world from other causes don&#x27;t misunderstand me but they&#x27;re going to blow it from this cause this i&#x27;m quite certain of in my own view so it means that anything i can do to try to stop that has to be done what we need is a great manhattan project you can do it this is a doable we have the principles we know how to do the giant egg entropy we have good scientists we have some sharp young grad students and post docs they aren&#x27;t allowed to work on these kinds of things for goodness sakes let&#x27;s marshal them together like we did in world war ii to get the atomic bomb which we went from zilch you might say in four years we had an operational bomb let&#x27;s do the same thing here because survival depends on it not only of us but a civilization there&#x27;s even a little evidence and i don&#x27;t know really how to to put this in perspective uh we had one friend for example that we worked with very closely who built practical over unity systems he demonstrated at a conference for for example an eight kilowatt system and then very mysteriously he and his whole family disappeared we have found out since in fact not long ago that he&#x27;s still around but and he&#x27;s doing very well because he was tired in a very expensive suit and a very nice automobile but he and his family are okay even though they disappeared back there but here was a successful unit that just flat disappeared off the face of the earth now i assume rightly or wrongly it has to either be for the great financial empires or it has to be for some kind of black project that somebody needed a power system that would power itself in the load and they classified it whatever it is i don&#x27;t know but whatever it is the survival of humanity itself and civilization itself is now at stake and i really believe through the auspices of the u.s government regardless of what that kind of program in it anywhere may have we must bring it forward to save ourselves and save the earth if we don&#x27;t we can keep it secret or we can keep it in the control group hands and we shall all go down to oblivion in about two thousand seven what needs doing immediately deals with the scientific community if you look at what the scientific community is doing i&#x27;m speaking sadly but i&#x27;m speaking bluntly and truthfully if you will read the literature you will find it&#x27;s almost business as usual they&#x27;re not doing anything that has any chance of stopping this problem before the world explodes in our faces sure windmills are good burning the oil cleaner is good all of these things building a couple of more dams is good if you don&#x27;t destroy too much of the biosphere etc etc building some windmills is good however that&#x27;s a spit in the ocean it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem the problem is just exactly like what we had in world war ii we have a problem it&#x27;s a doable it can be solved very quickly because we&#x27;ve got the first half of it already solved how to get the energy out of the vacuum so half of it is already done but we can&#x27;t get the scientific community to move on it to turn those young grad students loose and and those young postdocs loose the professor at the university for goodness sakes is trapped he&#x27;s absolutely trapped all the universities are greedy they want the overhead money he&#x27;s got to bring in extra money he&#x27;s got to get patents and of course he&#x27;s got to get his papers published so he&#x27;s caught in a process where he must compete for the packages which are put together and come down for availability to compete for if he doesn&#x27;t get those packages and win them he doesn&#x27;t fund his grad students he doesn&#x27;t get the overhead money he&#x27;s going to be lucky if he&#x27;s working for the grocery store instead of being a physicist so he&#x27;s in a mad scramble to try to fill and keep running on a treadmill to meet the conditions that&#x27;s been laid down on him and goodness sakes those packages already prescribe all the research he&#x27;s going to do and his grad students are going to do so we&#x27;ve got the whole scientific community working on the wrong problem so what could the us government do about that what we can do is do just like we did in alternative medicine or really like the manhattan project you can order the scientific community to do it whether they wish to do it or not and hold them accountable from the highest level to the bottom how much money are we spending in our national laboratories on nuclear stuff don&#x27;t we think at least about 10 percent of that money ought to be rooted out of there and spent on nothing but this which might save us while the other stuff takes us down the tube of course we should in fact it ought to be more than that the best scientists we have the best grad students the best post docs ought to be turned loose on this problem and that means funded and that means that we do not allow scientists to slander and liable people who are trying to do research in this area right now they do it wholesale and they do it at will now look at what they call me in print for goodness sake but the problem is the scientific community resists change and is doing business as usual and my bottom line is unless the legislative branch together with the administration forces them to get on this problem and solve it they will not only fiddle while rome burns they will help burn it only alternative you have now of course since at this moment as we speak the government has not moved the scientific community has not moved so that is a fact as of this moment i&#x27;m speaking i hope that changes i&#x27;m trying to change it but right now that is a fact and right now it&#x27;s a fact they&#x27;re not going to move unless something happens to move them and neither is a scientific community failing that the only thing left is the private industry and that&#x27;s a mixed bag first of all the moment you try to do it in the private industry then is when you are absolutely vulnerable to all the games for example lawsuit alone can hang you where you will never come out of it for the next 15 years the lawsuit doesn&#x27;t have to be justified or anything at all you can sue anybody for anything if you&#x27;ve got enough money to file a suit and want to swear simple as that so the other thing you have is you can trigger anybody from anywhere for all kinds of radicals to come out and say oh you still you used to call the wire or you used something over here you use some semiconductor you stole my invention and so the next thing you can be in court for 20 years on that all of this comes at you this is part of the delay this is the groups wanting to stay in power while we all go down the tubes they operate primarily in the private sector so you&#x27;re automatically in that arena where the real lions are after you all the time you&#x27;re over there trying to find a legitimate deal okay let&#x27;s talk about venture capital sometimes called vulture capital but if you find a good one it&#x27;s not vulture adventure what does a venture capitalist want to do he wants to buy 30 or 50 percent of your company or 51 or maybe 60. he&#x27;s got the money the second thing he wants to do is he&#x27;s going to move you and all your guys right out of there and he&#x27;s going to put his own management team in there and he&#x27;s going to run it with bean counters if you run this one with bean counters only you destroy the program before you start so your only choice then is to avoid venture capitalists like the plague and to try to go for licensing which means the brunt of doing the research on the front end falls on you and your bigger resources which for working people is whatever you can afford out your back pocket but if you don&#x27;t do that you&#x27;re not going to do it anyway how many have you seen in the past that went to venture capital route that were real how many of them made it i can name three or four they were real they&#x27;re not there yet they&#x27;re not going to be there they were buried so the thing that sets in you have to do it by licensing then you got to skirt you got to get the patent office the patent office says it&#x27;s impossible to do an over unity system the api the physics institute you know comes down on you says uh it&#x27;s absolutely against the laws of nature it isn&#x27;t you know these are people who haven&#x27;t even studied the problem and they know classical thermodynamics but it&#x27;s against the laws of nature and violates classical uh thermodynamics of course it violates classical thermal you can&#x27;t build one of these by classical thermal you build it by the other kind of thermodynamics so the next thing you have is scientific communities all over look what they did the cold fusion there&#x27;s real stuff in cold fusion you know 600 experiments worked for goodness sake so the thing is you&#x27;re against the scientific community is against you lock stock and barrel and by the way everything is a distribution curve get off of this horse pucky about scientists are always sweet nice reasonable people that is not true ten percent of them are devils ten percent of them are angels ought to be rewarded assaults of the earth but ten percent of them have absolutely no ethics absolutely playing nothing but the big monkey and power game and absolutely your worst enemy in this area glorious opportunity to in other words the vultures or the there&#x27;s a better word for it the wolves go around looking for the rabbits and you&#x27;re the rabbit and they&#x27;re the wolf so your next thing you get into is the big wolf wolf rabbit game with the the scientists over on that ten percent so you you face all of that meanwhile you&#x27;ve got to go to the patent office you get to the patent office what are you looking at this is impossible this is perpetual motion you say well the atoms have been doing this for 15 billion years it&#x27;s not perpetual motion but it&#x27;s just long lasting but they call it perpetual motion and of course there is an unwritten law that anything is perpetual motion shall not be even proved or looked at you can&#x27;t even get a serious consideration in the patent office i speak as one who has submitted patents in this area i know what i&#x27;m talking about defended a couple of them so what we have is a situation where the entire structure of science industry the organizations of science and the patent office are already against you if you can&#x27;t get a patent how can you license so it&#x27;s a real neat little thing so chicken and egg situation if i had the chickens i could get some eggs if i had the eggs i could get some chickens this situation is designed so you never get chickens and you never get eggs so the only thing you can do is is to try to put your head down and continue with that and do one other thing communication fortunately we do have the internet sure it&#x27;s full of lot of bad information it&#x27;s also full of a lot of good information you just have to discriminate so the other thing you have to do to have any chance at all is communicate communicate communicate communicate which we do to the limit that we&#x27;re legally able to do and not lose our patents if we can get the government to move they can cut through all of that by simply issuing the order to do it and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s going to take we&#x27;re going to struggle with this other but i&#x27;ll make your prediction if the government doesn&#x27;t move there&#x27;s a 75 to 80 percent chance we will fail we certainly won&#x27;t make the first quarter of 2004 and if we miss the first quarter of 2004 not just us there are several other inventors and and groups in the same area have have systems at work we are not the lone ranger here at all i want every system out there that works and is real going we need everything we can do but if we don&#x27;t make it by the first quarter then we may as well all go home and enjoy our families for the time we have left because it&#x27;s going to blow it will be too little and too late and don&#x27;t come in in 2006 when any fool can then see the world is fixing to blow up and say would you guys like to try this i&#x27;ll say no i&#x27;m going to enjoy my family while the time i have left you blew it back in 2000 2001. you decided right then to blow it and so it&#x27;s on your head and that&#x27;s will be all we can do if we don&#x27;t make the schedule everybody wants a modern life they want to get out of the mud and the slime and everything and have lights and have you know things that are powered and they have industry and jobs and homes and schools is a common uh strivings from the human heart and to try to do that the way we&#x27;re doing it will destroy the planet and we will forcefully destroy each other it seems to me we just ought to be wiser than that you</p>
