            <p>Here&#x27;s the wild thing about quantum physics. Nothing really exists until you observe it. So the moment that you place your attention on something, it shifts. It becomes real for you. So that means your focus isn&#x27;t passive, it&#x27;s creative.</p>
<p>And so where your attention goes, your energy really does flow. And reality grows with your observation. So ask yourself, what are you observing today? Scarcity or overflow? Fear or faith? Because your gaze is so powerful and reality is watching.</p>
