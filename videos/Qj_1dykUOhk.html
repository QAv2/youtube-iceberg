            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>This is Hannibal here from the Hannibal TV on YouTube with a UFO/UAP news update. This is my review of Dr. Eric Davis&#x27;s appearance on the Soul Podcast. Dr. Davis is highly credible.</p>
<p>Uh he&#x27;s worked for the government. He&#x27;s worked for Robert Bigalow. He&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s in the famous Wilson Davis man memo and this is by far the most detailed interview I&#x27;ve ever seen him give. I hope they bring him to testify in front of Congress and have him sign a waiver cuz he he is by far the most credible. He has nothing to sell.</p>
<p>He just wants to get the truth out there and not necessarily all the truth, but he&#x27;s had direct firsthand experience working with UFO technology that has been retrieved. He&#x27;s talked to a lot of people behind the scenes and I&#x27;m going to go into some of the stuff that he discussed in this interview. Uh basically he says the government has had knowledge about UAP since at least World War II. The the nuclear program is not a secret. He says obviously the uh the the details of it is and he doesn&#x27;t see why the UAP program can be known like the nuke program because I guess one of the reasons why they don&#x27;t go through with disclosure is because it&#x27;s scary.</p>
<p>He he thinks overall it&#x27;s a malevolent thing and it&#x27;s scary to have knowledge that there&#x27;s vis there&#x27;s various types of visitors out there at least four that are visiting us and and there&#x27;s nothing we can really do about it and we don&#x27;t really know what their intentions are. So he he&#x27;s just basically saying if we can have the knowledge that China could blow up blow us up at any moment or there can be mutually a destruct um mutually agreed upon destruction where where everyone&#x27;s just going to blow everyone up [gasps] then we should be able to handle without the world going crazy that there are UAPs out there. I personally think that it&#x27;s the UAPs that don&#x27;t want to be disclosed. Um he describes himself as and this guy is a genius by the way but basically a pro-ufologist paid for by big money people paid for by government programs to study UAP at a professional level. Um he says that we know that the the government knows the phenomenon is real.</p>
<p>Uh he says we don&#x27;t know the motivation. There is classified military evidence as well as civilian evidence that has been scientifically analyzed that also confirms this. Uh the sum total is it&#x27;s been a negative interaction with the human race overall. He says it has malevolent tendencies such as what happened in Brazil where hundreds of people were injured. There&#x27;s the abduction issues there.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s military aircraft that have been taken down. There&#x27;s people that have been burnt and had cancer and so forth. They&#x27;ve interfered with with military uh training. So overall, according to him, he thinks it&#x27;s been a bad interaction. Um, he said they interfered with the USS Nimmits with the tic-tac incident there.</p>
<p>They interfered with the USS Roosevelt. Uh, I believe that&#x27;s a ship with interference there. There&#x27;s been close range warship incidents with UAPs and US military warships in the ocean. And and here&#x27;s another big example that he gives. They&#x27;ve shut off missiles.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve shut off our ability to turn on nuclear missiles in both Russia and the US, which could have led to catastrophic incidents [clears throat] had one or the other side known that the others missile capabilities were were turned off. I mean, people say, &quot;Oh, they they&#x27;re just sending us a message, blah blah blah blah blah.&quot; The bottom line is we couldn&#x27;t activate nuclear missiles for a period of time due to these things which is which is really scary. He says he hasn&#x27;t seen any evidence where there&#x27;s been positive contact where they&#x27;re actually trying to teach us something legitimately. He&#x27;s seen no legitimate evidence of that. There&#x27;s no open exchange of information.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t see it as a space brothers type of thing where they&#x27;re wanting to help us because if they want to help us, they can just help us. They have harmed people. There&#x27;s been horrific health effects from people who have had interactions with not only the craft um but some of these abducted cases. Apparently, military people have been harmed in classified situations. he&#x27;s aware of uh where there is sealed medical files and there&#x27;s also been unclassified situations that have come out.</p>
<p>Uh he says regular people like Travis Walton who I&#x27;ve interviewed had been harmed too. He was zapped trying to touch a UAP. He said Sean Kurpatre who was once head of of Arrow is a blatant liar. He hate he does not like Shan Kurpatre. He met with them in Alabama in January 2023.</p>
<p>He told them everything he knew and they took everything he said as rumors even though he was directly working for the government. Uh he said they did ad homum attacks on him. Uh so he he directly they directly try to discredit him even though he&#x27;s a highly credible person. the this Sean Kurpatre guy I&#x27;ve heard nothing good from and he he has since been removed from that arrow position but this whole arrow seems to be a big joke. Apparently George W.</p>
<p>Bush who he worked with was interested in the phenomenon. He said a le one of George Bush&#x27;s liaison officers accidentally briefed him about the Hollowman Air Force Base UAP landing where supposedly there was three craft that hovered around the Air Force base and one of the craft actually landed and there was a meeting between one of the entities with CIA personnel which which is which has not been revealed in the contents of that meeting was not revealed to Bush but that that landing did actually happen. It was it was confirmed by Bush directly to Davis that the Hollowman Air Force base landing was real. And you know what? Jim Semi Van, who at one point was a high ranking member of the CIA, did say, he didn&#x27;t directly confirm this situation, but he was asked in an interview, do you think there&#x27;s been face-toface meetings with ETSs and members of of the US government? And he said yes, he thinks that&#x27;s happened. And again, apparently, according to Davis, the aliens actually met with CIA personnel.</p>
<p>Um, apparently the being that talked to that member of the CIA was in a one-piece suit and had some type of wand that it could talk into that acted as a translator, I guess, on on both sides through this wand that the ET had. It had a breathing apparatus over its mouth. Uh Bush was not allowed to see the file. Uh he asked the national security security adviser to see the file and everything UAP at the White House and he was not granted access to it all. Um, apparently in 2009 or sorry, yeah, he was told this in 2009 and this meeting with the non-human intelligence officer.</p>
<p>Uh, he he says there was another meeting, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the same one, with uh in 1964 with members of the CIA and this one was in New Mexico. I&#x27;ll have to clarify if the Hollowan Air Force base is in New Mexico, but he says there was a meeting with the CIA and an NHI in in 1964. And there was he confirmed that the 1974 documentary that uh Black and White documentary where supposedly they were going to film a UFO and say it was a UFO. I believe it&#x27;s called UFOs past, present, and future. He says the craft in that are legit and those are the three craft uh one of those three craft were the ones that landed at Hollowman Air Force Base.</p>
<p>So the the uh the person in that craft was believed to be a Nordic Nordic alien. There is a video of the alien getting off the craft which is considered above top secret. The White House general counsel told President Bush there was no need to know for him on that subject. He never paid any attention to the UAP topic before he heard about this around 2008 2009. He was only told by accident through the liaison officer.</p>
<p>The liaison officer thought he had already had a UAP briefing. He did not have security security clearance to know more details than he was told. Uh Eric Davis has met with senators and briefed uh various oversight committees about the UAP reality and skiffs. Uh he says in his belief that UAPs and NHI have been interacting with humanity since the beginning of humanity. Um apparently we have according to him he doesn&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve been able to to figure out all the technology that we&#x27;ve retrieved.</p>
<p>He believes um we know how some of it works but we don&#x27;t necessarily have the materials here to be able to duplicate it from what he&#x27;s aware of. He believes we are further ahead than Russia because he he consider as he also believes China is interacting these but he says Russia right now is uh in an economic failure with their military and he he points to the UK the the Ukraine uh war is proof of that they haven&#x27;t been able to end that war. Hello to my Irish friend. Well, I believe it. I 100 if you know what I&#x27;ll tell you guys and why you&#x27;ve seen me do less interviews.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had some that I don&#x27;t believe on here. I&#x27;ve had some more out there people and some of them I believe some of what they say but not all of what they say. I&#x27;m trying to keep this as down to earth and realistic as possible. And if there&#x27;s one person couple people I believe Jim Samu van I believe Eric Davis I believe. Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you, my friend. Confirming the Hollerman Air Force Base is in New Mexico. So, okay. So, that whole thing would have been, and I made those notes a couple days ago, so I&#x27;m sorry it&#x27;s not fresh in my mind. The Hollowman Air Force Base incident would have been in &#x27; 64, but they considered putting it in the UFOs past, present, and future documentary in 74.</p>
<p>Someone mentions a god in India is an elephant and sometimes it&#x27;s seen with a trunk uh breathing tank. Yeah. Well, a lot of people think and I&#x27;m not here to insult any religions, but the whole UAPHI thing could have presented themselves as various gods to people or they have been they could have been taken as as gods over the years. that whole Fatima angel angels incident that happened um in the early 1900s overseas. A lot of people believe, including Jacques Valet, another credible person in my opinion, that those were most likely aliens.</p>
<p>Someone says the aliens are connected to the craft like a heartbeat. Again, that&#x27;s one of the harder things for me to be able to swallow. Could it be possible? Yes. But I don&#x27;t know if I can fully swallow that yet. That that&#x27;s a lot for me to swallow.</p>
<p>And and I didn&#x27;t hear Eric Davis say that. By the way, as I said, he only talks about things that he has direct interactions and proof of. Um, but yeah, [clears throat] let me know what you guys think if you saw it. Uh, the Eric Davis soul interview. I found it very interesting.</p>
<p>Actually watched it twice. Have a great Sunday.</p>
