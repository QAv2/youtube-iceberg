            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>have human beings being hurt or killed by a non-human intelligence while I can&#x27;t get into the specifics because that would reveal a certain U.S classified operations I was briefed by a few individuals on the program that there were malevolent events like that so this is a this is interesting you know we have to take seriously anytime someone like David grush who appears to be you know by all accounts uh a serious individual you know not just some crank who&#x27;s you know working in the Air Force military intelligence and who&#x27;s claiming to be a whistleblower you know what he&#x27;s saying is rather extraordinary that the United States and other governments has been recovering um basically crashed or landed alien spacecraft right they use their euphemisms you know non-human intelligence origin things you know uh and even some bodies of aliens non-human you know extraterrestrial aliens uh so definitely interesting I still don&#x27;t believe any of it though I gotta be honest with you I am skeptical of the whole thing it seems to be falling into the same pattern that we have been seeing for the last 70 plus years at the end of the day it&#x27;s all just stories and innuendo and friend of a friend kind of indirect evidence and just a suggestion that there&#x27;s something sinister going on but you never ever ever see actual evidence now of course the moment someone comes forward with actual evidence then I will reevaluate that and be happy to change my mind if the United States and other governments have been engaged in a multi-decade campaign to recover and examine alien spacecraft I would be extremely interested in that I that would be fascinating I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s happening it doesn&#x27;t make the story doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me so first of all so this requires that aliens are visiting the Earth they&#x27;re obviously keeping their presence secret from the public you know but they&#x27;re crashing all the time how does that make any sense they have the technology to travel Interstellar distances which is you know we don&#x27;t even know how we would do it at this point in time that&#x27;s extremely advanced technology and they&#x27;re having trouble keeping from crashing on Earth why would that happen or there&#x27;s the suggestion that maybe at times we&#x27;ve shot them down really we shot them down that&#x27;s like trying to take down an F-16 with a good Longbow you know it&#x27;s like the the technological disconnect there doesn&#x27;t make sense either um and let&#x27;s say we did it once you don&#x27;t think that they would learn from that to keep it from happening again but they&#x27;re saying this has been happening multiple multiple times over decades further I don&#x27;t believe that the government has the capability of keeping this level of Secret for this long there&#x27;s no evidence that they can do it it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense over multiple multiple administrations are you telling me that if Donald Trump got word of this when he was president he would not have leaked this he would not have just decided that this is something that the American public need to know at no point no one decided that this you know didn&#x27;t need to be the very existence of it didn&#x27;t need to be classified I could understand why if they had alien material that they were trying to reverse engineer that they would keep the material secret and what they learned secret but just the very fact of their existence over decades they&#x27;re going to keep it secret I don&#x27;t think so and then they make it worse by saying that other countries are involved so not only is one country involved every country in the world who happens upon these alien material have also kept it secret for decades I&#x27;m sorry that is completely implausible so the story does not make any sense it doesn&#x27;t make any sense that they would be here if they were it doesn&#x27;t make sense that they would be crashing like flies all over the place it doesn&#x27;t make sense that the government could keep it secret for that long or that multiple governments can keep it secret for that long and then when you know I&#x27;m always looking for what&#x27;s the real evidence here what are they actually saying and when of course we don&#x27;t have all the details yet we don&#x27;t have the full disclosure the full interview and I will happily pour through those details when they become available but it&#x27;s always just a suggestion it you know at one point he says I have proof not of aliens but I have proof that the government is hiding information okay so what yeah the government hides information not something on this scale you know not enough for a long period of time they can keep things secret for a short period of time but not on this scale for so long through multiple again administrations um but but there&#x27;s no there&#x27;s a suggestion that yes somebody told me that there was you know people were hurt Yeah by in what exact circumstances by by what you know what exactly happened you always get these little tidbits of a suggestion that there&#x27;s something going on but never the actual uh first-hand information the physical objects actual evidence it&#x27;s always just a friend of a friend and a suggestion and being you know it&#x27;s being weaved into this compelling UFO narrative this guy sounds sincere he may believe that the that you know the information that he was next to adds up to the government&#x27;s hiding aliens but I think he&#x27;s making a huge leap of inference at one or multiple junctures and he is maybe not being completely transparent about what he actually knows and what he is inferring from what he thinks he knows so I predict that yet again this is going to be a massive nothing burger that at the end of the day we&#x27;re going to be no closer to having any real information about aliens visiting the Earth and by the way NASA has already came out and said no that as far as they&#x27;re concerned they have zero information about our government having access to any alien space technology and you kind of would think that NASA would know about that if it did exist now of course the conspiracy theorists can just say well everything&#x27;s a lie everything&#x27;s a lie they&#x27;re lying about everything of course they didn&#x27;t take this guy out right that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the other way the conspiracy theories always fall down because they need somebody with the information or somebody who&#x27;s a whistleblower but at the same time they need to maintain this narrative that the government has this totally locked down except for this one guy or these people who somehow come come through with the suggestive but not really definitive information you can&#x27;t have it both ways right either the government has a lockdown and we would never even hear about it or they don&#x27;t and then why doesn&#x27;t NASA know that that we have alien material or alien spacecraft no one in the scientific Community apparently knows you know Congress apparently doesn&#x27;t know so the whole story doesn&#x27;t make sense it&#x27;s just a massive yet again a massive conspiracy theory built on innuendo and suggestion I&#x27;m happy to change my mind when I see some actual evidence that&#x27;s been my position for the last 40 years and I have yet to see any actual evidence that is in the slightest bit compelling it&#x27;s all still just storytelling foreign</p>
