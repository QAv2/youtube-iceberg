            <p>a new device backed by a former NASA scientist claims to challenge gravity itself and could revolutionize Transportation as we know it could we finally be on the brink of achieving the dream of anti-gravity travel Dr Charles buer co-founder of Exodus propulsion Technologies brings over 20 years of experience from his work on NASA&#x27;s space shuttle the ISS and the Hubble telescope his teams break through centers on their propellantless propulsion Drive which seemingly defies traditional physics by generating a force strong enough to counter Earth&#x27;s gravity according to ber this new force is created solely through electric Fields without expelling mass potentially transforming transportation and space travel for the next thousand years at a recent alternative propulsion energy conference ape Dr Charles presented his team&#x27;s findings on their propellantless propulsion drive from 2016 to 2020 their devices produced minimal thrust but their progress quickly Advanced by 2021 after testing 146 configurations and eliminating conventional explanations they generated 10 millons this result while small confirmed their devices potential with new designs they achieved a force equivalent to 110th thousandth of Earth&#x27;s gravity still far from their goal but showing promise in early 2022 the research team led by Dr Charles berer saw an unexpected leap in the thrust generated by their propulsion devices as they continued refining their designs the forces measured increased rapidly progressing from a thousandth of gravity to by late 2023 achieving a full Earth gravity this means that their latest devices weighing around 30 40 G now produce enough thrust to fully counteract the gravitational pull of Earth buer and his team believe they&#x27;ve uncovered a new force that Taps into electrostatic asymmetry to generate propulsion without the need for propellant this suggests that when there&#x27;s an imbalance in electrostatic pressure or a Divergent electrostatic field it results in a nonzero force on the system&#x27;s Center of mass potentially bypassing Newton&#x27;s Third Law Dr ber speculates that their technology could be a practical realization of quantized inertia a controversial Theory because it seemingly violates Newton&#x27;s third law of motion Dr ber and his team are now preparing for the final step launching their propulsion system into space while they&#x27;ve thoroughly tested it on Earth the true validation lies in seeing how The Exodus effect performs in a real space environment we&#x27;ve done everything possible on Earth Earth but space will be the true test ber explained with their newly granted patent Exodus propulsion Technologies is also planning to publish a comprehensive scientific paper this will outline the discovery of what they believe is a groundbreaking new Force supported by years of data however with thousands of test results to sift through Boer admits the task of compiling it all into a peer-reviewed study will be enormous the discovery of The Exodus effect led by Dr Charles buer marks a pivotal moment in propulsion technology potentially redefining space travel and even terrestrial Transportation could this breakthrough be the key to propellantless space travel and what does it mean for the future of Transportation let us know in the comments [Music]</p>
