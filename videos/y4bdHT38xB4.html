            <p>what is the difference between our roads and universe universe is a speed limit it&#x27;s a good one but you know physicist miguel alcubierre found a way to break that limit too bro general relativity forbids faster than light trouble ironically he used general relativity to find the way general relativity teaches us that space is malleable and huge masses or energy can deform space mathematically general relativity stands on this equation known as einstein field equation now i know this equation looks complex but it&#x27;s super easy to understand the right side this thing collects data about mass or energy distribution where these all are constants now if you put some data about mass distribution in the right side of this equation and solve the equation in the left side you will get how that must deform the space time general relativity also says nothing in space can travel faster than light but there&#x27;s a fun fact this limit is only for movement of object inside space-time but not to the movement of space-time itself now let&#x27;s dive into the idea of make will available let&#x27;s represent our malleable space with this slinky now the idea is what if we take a region of space and put our spaceship there and expand space behind us and contract in front of it that&#x27;s how we can move at any arbitrary speed how will you deform space like this that&#x27;s so easy we have to contract space in front of us and expand behind us so we know the geometry of the space time algubia they put the geometry of space in the left side and did back calculation to know what the mass or energy distribution should be to deform space like this but what he got wasn&#x27;t much impressive it turns out that we need energy equivalence of more mass than our entire visible universe that&#x27;s impossible what makes it worse than that is we need negative amount of it so the idea is mathematically possible but physically imposed but in 2011 nasa scientist dr harald white further reworked on it and surprisingly he reduced the negative energy requirement to equivalence of minus 700 calories still a lot but it made the idea from impossible to at least possible what the heck is negative energy to be honest it&#x27;s unknown to our known physics but in quantum world some theory proves existence but we can&#x27;t harness negative energy from there but there is something that can be hopeful for us to explain expansion of universe scientists discovered something called dark energy it&#x27;s named dark because we don&#x27;t know anything about it but our observation shows that it somehow behaves like negative and new ideas are being proposed constantly will the youth of the world need to study and resist on it who knows maybe one day you will propose your own technology</p>
