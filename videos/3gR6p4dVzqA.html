            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>yeah and i i want to thank you that was a wonderfully wonderful and very in-depth presentation um a lot of stuff because i&#x27;m working with sarah a lot of the stuff that you said resonated with me the pulsed current i i can&#x27;t stress that enough i saw exactly what you described i&#x27;ve seen that in my own experiments i think a lot of other people have as well so um let me do this i will i&#x27;ll set it up so that people can unmute themselves now i&#x27;ll re-enable that and who would like to ask questions can i jump in go for it mike welcome sir no no no it&#x27;s a few hours from now that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s supposed to do you&#x27;re not allowed to well you guys are just discovering what we discovered a long time ago when you get to ac you&#x27;ll get someplace you&#x27;re starting to get your pulse current when you run the full sine wave uh you get ac and it works much better uh we did a lot of this vortex work uh laminar flow with about 35 kilovolts ac in my lab uh many years ago the only problem is it&#x27;s got an rf field that so for uh super secret uh it doesn&#x27;t work very well because everybody sees you coming yeah so you can&#x27;t use it in conjunction with these uh cmgs to control moments arrows no i don&#x27;t think it would work on that but uh we blew up a uh test fixture um a supersonic test fixture in uh in the lab with uh we were testing laminar flow at supersonic speeds and the thing come unglued thank you so there&#x27;s the side effects from the high voltage i see hector serrano&#x27;s on the uh the list of contributors here maybe he could tell us a couple words about the results of his patent oh yeah uh let let me see here yeah muted right now i&#x27;ll ask hector to unmute yeah what&#x27;s up what&#x27;s the update on your patent oh that thing&#x27;s been abandoned we don&#x27;t we don&#x27;t do stuff like that anymore just about any knowledge approach we don&#x27;t yeah that that design by the way yeah john louis new down uh tested that uh right after he saw win the pattern if you can go to his website and check it out and you&#x27;ll see that he did test it he built like his basically literally took every he took everything in the patent literal and kind of built it that way out of foam and aluminum and rigged beautiful work and uh uh we we tested it we worked and um and uh we just we just um moved forward to another design um to try to get a little bit better performance and then later on we are now in a third uh iteration of the whole concept that we&#x27;ve been testing and does it work well the third iteration works a hell of better than the last two are you gonna publish any results probably not [Laughter] i will i i&#x27;ll put up videos and i&#x27;m planning on actually allowing people to know like the moment of you know uh the moment um there&#x27;s a moment of the device so you guys can get your own calculate your own performance based on what you observe from the videos and stuff so you&#x27;ll be able to have references and things like that and we&#x27;ll give you inputs and outputs but what&#x27;s inside the black box nobody gets to see i was going to say is it a black box we&#x27;re dealing with absolutely it literally is a black box well now if there&#x27;s a way to ask hector uh i i mean tom just made a really interesting case about patents being taken so so then are you going to do we don&#x27;t do patents trade secret absolutely that&#x27;s the route we took and uh uh a lot of the people that we&#x27;re dealing with in uh tech right now and the ones we&#x27;re forming uh uh joint ventures with are extremely happy that we&#x27;re going the trade route uh um direction and not the patent because we simply there&#x27;s just too many it&#x27;s just too easy patents are just too easy to like rip off so we&#x27;re like yeah no forget it done so and that&#x27;s also why our business model is yeah you will provide services so we&#x27;re doing what we call vertical integration we&#x27;re going to be the operators of the cubesat uh imaging system and things like that wow and you&#x27;re producing a significant force from whatever voltage you&#x27;re using well we almost every single time we tested like the one you saw and uh in the pattern and stuff like that when we got it tweaked in just right we would get between 24 and 31 millinewtons per watt yeah so so basically we uh um um you know and what you would actually observe in a laboratory was in the range of like um like when we did the vacuum test and things like that if you guys saw um you can see those when we did those vacuum tests uh those are still in our youtube uh page uh the uh we were at we were seeing about four millimeters of force at around 16 000 volts or so so um and like i said that that video is posted you don&#x27;t you have to guess i mean we&#x27;re doing that at uh what 10 to the negative six uh tour so yeah visible thrust you don&#x27;t have to squint or guess it&#x27;s there uh but you know i&#x27;ve never look i don&#x27;t care if anybody believes or not i just keep moving forward so so i was like i don&#x27;t you know the market force is the only one i really care about so so uh i have a different mentality i guess than most of my peers on this and by the way just so you know uh polenikov actually was in contact uh well boeing was in contact with politico and polenikov actually led them back to tt brown yeah i know that for effect because i know the guy who actually told me that is from phantomworks um you know if i could jump in really quick david just posted this in just a reminder he posted this into chat that mark mccandless passed away i think this was probably about two weeks ago now yeah yeah and that&#x27;s that yeah there and there is a link to his obituary in there and it appears to be confirmed um now i think we mentioned this at last week&#x27;s conference as a possibility uh mark sokol was i think one of the first people he found this out while he was trying to do some conference lookups on mark he found the obituary and so uh but tom thank you for mentioning mark&#x27;s legacy you know the in in your presentation and we&#x27;re happy to have his whole report it was it was difficult to get mark to agree to allow us to actually publish his uh entire report on the norton air force-based craft so i was pleased to get that involved into the book and and then he basically backed down and said it was okay so i felt it was a very important but i have to give a lot of credit to hector because he&#x27;s basically told us and confirmed thomas and brown&#x27;s most controversial um claim that this effect works in a vacuum oh yeah well we did it the leaf facility first we did it with purdue university in their own vacuum uh bell jar we still got the video on that but i can&#x27;t show it because they own it uh uh then we did it at the leave facility uh and then we did it again on um on our own uh that was and then uh uh sunny white tested what we call second generation sfv uh as a confirmation effort for darpa at the time and they uh that they also saw force very good force of that so uh um so yeah we&#x27;ve never had a problem prohibiting an improv that there&#x27;s a force present in fact that&#x27;s the entire basis of our research is like throw away the eye on when what&#x27;s left why is that thing keep moving let&#x27;s harness that because that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where the money&#x27;s at you know that&#x27;s that you know that you know literally that&#x27;s the real deal everything else yeah it&#x27;s okay by the way the modern term for the ion wind effect you guys are talking about is referred to as plasma actuators and they&#x27;re very popular now in the industry oh interesting so you&#x27;ll be able to go to mars and maybe alpha centauri pretty soon ah that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a boeing calculator it&#x27;s interesting 12 years to al centauri you know if i could jump in again real quick um paula violet is here it looks like he has his mic hot i&#x27;m not sure if he wanted to yeah he had anything to say welcome sir yeah whether you want to go to mars or alpha centauri i&#x27;m not sure which one yeah i just want to comment about you mentioned jeffermenko i just wanted to note in the equations you you don&#x27;t see mass appearing right and uh right whereas thomson brown was his electrogravitic effect he demonstrated depends on mass that if you increase the mass between the electrodes you get more force yeah right so you know there is probably a jeffermenko effect but there is also electrogravitic effect uh what similar what thompson brown discovered also also uh about the use of the he was emphasizing about charging and discharging the capacitors very quickly he was interested in high frequency dielectrics actually and um the reason and i gave an explanation in my book in secrets um that the reason his pendulum lost energy it was just on the onset of the voltage he would get thrust and then it would gradually subside is because his dielectric was polarizing and as the dielectric polarizes it cancels out the field on the plates in effect so um that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s true the two diagrams that we see uh in the how i control gravitation are not polarized they&#x27;re exactly symmetrical well in his uh capacitors he was getting polarization uh as any any dielectric will polarize if you wait long enough the uh deleter polarizes and uh you still it still works as a capacitor but um it loses its electrogravitic field because when when it&#x27;s first applied the field is first applied that field is going all the way through the mass of the dielectric whereas when the dielectric of polarizing cancels out that it&#x27;s no longer going through the dielectric has what&#x27;s called hysteresis so you can you can i used to do measurements use on infrared detectors where they would use make these uh capacitors and and you could uh they did what&#x27;s called bias stressing and by doing those tests you could uh figure out the the density of mobile charges in the in the um depletion region of the diet so it&#x27;s a hysteresis so you you bias it one way and then when you go and you switch to the opposite polarity it takes some time to go back so it makes kind of like a loop like up and like an s with the space in between so ideally you&#x27;d want to put dc pulses on your capacitor charge discharge charge discharge but not reverse and you can make use of that effect you just said about the polarization um if you pre-polarize a capacitor then you can apply ac to it and when the ac goes negative actually the potential goes to zero instead of going negative because you already have it&#x27;s bucking the polarization of the capacitor so that&#x27;s a nice effect that you can make use of with a tank circuit you you do ac with a tank circuit and pre-polarize a capacitor you could use that for developing thrust by mass dielectric well thank you paul and again i think everything you guys are describing reinforces everything that we saw with the lifters when we were experimenting with those that the pulse dc and paul what you were talking about was yeah biasing in ac um that the best results that i saw were with a sharp sawtooth wave we all started with those you know computer monitor flybacks i think that was the thing that everybody started with and maybe by complete coincidence that seemed like the best results that we saw came from that but what you&#x27;re describing with the biased ac would probably work just as well you know so and it definitely reinforces what tom had said about jeff minkow&#x27;s jeff amenka&#x27;s equation as well if i could just chime in on that i actually tried that as well um independent of all you guys a couple of years ago i had this theory that we should try a sawtooth wave with a sharp rise time or fall time uh basically slanted sawtooth and i used um triode vacuum tubes three uh i think actually four of them in series they were all controlled via fiber optics and it&#x27;s one of the earliest videos on the falcon space youtube channel and um i got like 70 kilovolts controlled in this sawtooth wave pattern and the results were very interesting unfortunately my scale went haywire and started showing like half a pound of weight loss so i don&#x27;t really trust that i do want to try that experiment again though generate rf when you do that by the way yeah yeah the scale went went completely haywire and they&#x27;re done dad you gotta ferret occasion yep um well yeah let me so let me let me try and wrote things back in who who else has questions for yeah i&#x27;ve been uh actually been waiting since we&#x27;ve got paul and uh you know we&#x27;ve got we&#x27;ve got a violet and we&#x27;ve got blown in the same space which is kind of awesome for electro gravitics right so i&#x27;ve played around with a lot of parallel plate capacitor configurations asymmetric plate capacitor configurations leaky dielectrics not leaky dielectrics i&#x27;ve tried a lot of things and um i can tell you for sure just flat out we&#x27;ll close the case here if there&#x27;s no leakage and it&#x27;s pure dc if there&#x27;s no current flow there&#x27;s no horse just flat out there if there&#x27;s no motion there&#x27;s no force now we can say for sure so this is and you showed a picture um uh earlier in the slideshow this is uh one of those capacitors basically identical or almost identical to what was done in that test it&#x27;s a glass plate capacitor glass is slightly leaky so it does allow us some small amount of current flow which gives us a small amount of electron acceleration but ultimately the flow is in narrow regions it&#x27;s not evenly distributed and so this this system at 80 kb i couldn&#x27;t measure as much as 0.01 grams of force so if it was producing a force it was below 0.01 grams and so even a symmetrical configuration of pure dc with a with a 10kb pulse on top of it we&#x27;re still talking a measurement of my scale that&#x27;s less than 0.1 grams and so uh that that could easily do within the noise force so my my issue is it doesn&#x27;t seem to be that just a poster or a sawtooth waveform is enough even at uh 1 000 times faster rise time than the fall time it still didn&#x27;t give us hardly any force at incredibly high voltages and so i guess my big question that&#x27;s left me scratching my head for the last 21 years is if it&#x27;s simply pulse dc that doesn&#x27;t work if it needs to be incredibly fast just how fast does it need to be in order to see these forces because i&#x27;m telling you with slower speeds we did not see them and we&#x27;ve done a lot of tests yeah but also the shape of the positive electrode may be significant as the air force research lab seemed to um did you guys ever see well this goes back to campbell campbell and i go back away campbell&#x27;s device just so you guys know let&#x27;s put it on the record and you can double check with the fbi and the oig about this uh because we we basically he learned uh that device was a replica of what we showed him over here in florida uh i won&#x27;t go into the details that like i said we could spend quite a bit of time on that bottom line um after that nasa paid one of the i think it was the universe uh it was the university of west virginia to actually do some experiments for them to to replicate kind of his device in vacuum uh they didn&#x27;t see much it was really good uh good experiment i i forget the exact group that did it uh but uh what really astounded me was that when their system arched it moved and they couldn&#x27;t explain it yeah acceleration right exactly that acceleration moment they could not explain it they calculated it out to the to down to the map to the last atom and it could not account anywhere near the observed force all right the acceleration field isn&#x27;t part of those equations now yeah so it was like it was very interesting it was like the it&#x27;s probably the the the most uh uh uh the most valuable part of that whole set of experiments they try high voltage they did it the normal way and then when they raise the voltage a little bit above what what the system can take it snapped with an arc and they saw it move and they were like well we can&#x27;t account for that you know they tried they really did and in their report they say it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an unknown variable that happened there confirming that same thing that you have to have a discharge or a current flow there has to be on and not just not just a current flow either not just a dc current flow there has to be an acceleration if without that there&#x27;s nothing i i would say with lifters and in fact in in many of the early videos now we&#x27;ve seen the same thing yeah when there&#x27;s when there&#x27;s an arc right like the corona wire i mean the earlier ones you had lots of problems with that and when there is an arc discharge it jumps so well as an example apocalypse gravity impulse beam is basically a sawtooth wave what he&#x27;s doing he&#x27;s discharging suddenly through his uh anode to the cathode and basically what he&#x27;s doing is creating a gravity wave with the idea that electrons are anti-gravitic and he gets a repulsive power from that in my lecture a few weeks back where i was talking about the navy patents analyzing them that&#x27;s essentially what they&#x27;re doing they&#x27;re creating electrogravitic waves by i believe using sawtooth pulsations uh they talk about using microwave uh sources there but they don&#x27;t say what the wave shape is but i bet you it is sawtooth and those waves are real waves that go out and you can in the case of the ufo they&#x27;re basically charging up the gravity potential outside the hull of the ship with these pulsations these gravity waves you you dc they&#x27;re tesla waves really they&#x27;re unidirectional always in the same direction pushing pushing think of it as a pump so i think some of these phenomena that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening with a sudden spark you know if you analyze it figure where the electron is going because electrons are the antigravitic part thank you paul um yeah and again all from my perspective all of this stuff makes sense um well so let me go back we&#x27;re about 1 30. um does anybody else have questions for tom because he covered a lot of areas i do so ah okay um yeah go ahead go ahead michael sorry so i&#x27;m curious tom if you&#x27;ve ever considered that um you know how electric field in in the em the electric field and and the magnetic field are 90 degrees out of phase from each other so uh so they have a phase difference of 90 degrees so have you ever considered the possibility that the the the gravito magnetic field would be at a different phase angle say 45 degrees instead of 90. well that&#x27;s where polyviolet comes in but theoretically i haven&#x27;t looked at very many theories that account for all the phenomena you guys have mentioned and also all the phenomena that we&#x27;ve recorded today so when i&#x27;m when i&#x27;m being more specific i&#x27;m thinking if you think of a triangle wave instead you know a triangle weight i think it it&#x27;s a if you do a derivative of that with the 45 degrees it&#x27;s it&#x27;s flat it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like so basically what i&#x27;m asking so what the reason i raise this is because in in my experiments what i&#x27;m doing is i&#x27;m i have to adjust the phase angle between the magnetic field and the electric field in order to uh get the read back signal from the the from for the the mr set resistor sensor and it just turns out that that phase angle difference is at 45 degrees and so that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m i&#x27;m curious if any of you have observed this effect of the this phase angle difference between gravity and electromagnetism well um like with pogonov&#x27;s work he doesn&#x27;t use magnetism they&#x27;re pulses so they&#x27;re basically classifying them as scalar waves just pure electric pulse but uh there is a patent by wallace talking about varying uh uh creating a gravito equivalent of a magnetic field but with gravity where he uses ac somehow with certain types of conductors to transmit the wave and so you get to the conclusion that there must be the gravity equivalent of the magnetic field also yeah when you move an electric field you create a magnetic field gravity field it&#x27;s at 45 degrees and if you think of a sine wave if you think of a sine wave and how the signal scales that would explain why gravity seems weak because the phase isn&#x27;t right you mean because the phase isn&#x27;t right um so what would you say is happening when you&#x27;re changing to a 45 degree phase well i i think what&#x27;s going on is the the what&#x27;s the most this is just my you know i&#x27;m just thought experiment what&#x27;s the most uh dense uh structure of matter and the one that comes to mind is the diamond and the diamond is called tetrahedral structure and it has this this 45 degree phase angle difference applies that&#x27;s what makes it tetrahedral and so perhaps it has something to do with the stoichiometry of space-time maybe so my thought is that space-time has it&#x27;s like even empty space is uh has a stoichiometry so you&#x27;re still working in einstein&#x27;s uh physics theory yeah yeah i think that would apply to his physics right now you know the ether has been validated with there was a recent paper with the gps satellites it shows that definitely the it&#x27;s when you say ether do you mean the vacuum the vacuum energy yeah well yeah that there&#x27;s um which which i&#x27;ll put off says has no bandgap and all i&#x27;m saying is yeah it does and that means it has a stoichiometry well look well from what i&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s what the black projects work with is the ether concept that i was told that by a fellow named ray who&#x27;s the same guy that disclosed about the b2 charging swings and that was published in that was pretty cool aerospace technology and they said it&#x27;s based on thomson brown&#x27;s work and tesla&#x27;s work basically and that&#x27;s those two theories put them together explain the navy patent um but brown wasn&#x27;t he was looking into ether theories and he had he was developing his own and then there&#x27;s frank ferguson&#x27;s whose father worked in the classified world in washington he was called in when uh there was the raid of the ufos in 52 on washington and he was a radar expert and they called him in after that he got involved in the black projects and uh the hit frank was a young fellow someday you might have him on the show to tell his story and he he was saying how they would get regular visits from a guy named arnowitz whose name appears i think in the electic systems document and arnowitz would have conversations with einstein at princeton and and he remembers arnowitz telling his father his father that well you know they don&#x27;t go by einstein&#x27;s theory anymore they&#x27;re looking more like hyman burke what&#x27;s the other fella&#x27;s name a german theorist so they realized that einstein&#x27;s theory wasn&#x27;t explaining what they&#x27;re finding you know but it you should i think explore more of the ether approaches and that&#x27;s where the future is i would say how how&#x27;s uh hypo hypothesis is is uh uh in my mind is it&#x27;s using what this what the vacuum energy and he&#x27;s looking at it as a you know essentially a a bipolar that there&#x27;s still two types of of this energy that&#x27;s one form of ether i&#x27;m not discounting the theory is saying uh [Music] alternatives that are just as valid well guys let me uh let me go to will reichen real quick and will&#x27;s had his hand up for a while uh will did you have a question for tom we&#x27;re getting off track a little bit but i want to try and keep it focused on tom&#x27;s q a okay um yeah tom i was wondering you started out in college even homophobic generators how did how did that translate into where you are now i don&#x27;t understand the question always your question again could you repeat that you you wrote the book humble poetry generators right and i was wondering i believe that that is the beginning where you began so how did that how did that get you to where you are today oh yeah well that&#x27;s a good point um actually i told my story at the uh citizens uh hearing um that can i think of 2015 downtown national press club and that&#x27;s online it&#x27;s basically only a 10 minute youtube video and we used to have it accessible from our website we may have it accessible again soon but the important part is that i started with the homopolar because that was the information that i gathered from the norman paulston book sunburst return of the ancients and that was an intriguing book i read in 1980 i went out to the community sunburst community to basically just discern whether their invention was worth looking at it was supposed to be a free energy device and that&#x27;s how i became friends with uh bruce de palma and bruce de palma was a swirly figure that basically kept getting investors to help them build another homophobe generator which you would attach to a homopolar motor and claim that it would be over unity um unfortunately i was in between that and essentially a young grad student so i ended up believing this stuff could be real and i built my own home of polar generator so magnetism became part of my thesis project for physics in sunny buffalo and i was fortunate enough to have a couple professors who supported my investigation and the measurements i made but i did measure back torque so that was the um kind of the deflating of the excitement that i felt for free energy but then i was actually pursuing the serol device for example afterwards i corresponded with john cearl i actually met him in germany when i was there to talk about the homophobia generator that the palma was encouraging me to build so john searle&#x27;s in invention turns out has rotating hollow polar generators around the outer edge those are the rotor magnets so that became an interesting thing to help the russians develop their patent and get funding for it and basically i was helping investors get connected to inventors and then they essentially go off into the sunset and in that case the russian device never really worked so unfortunately ivan kruglach put a lot of money into it and i believe excuse me paul murad perhaps says another continuing story on how that&#x27;s developing because there you have rotating magnets producing high voltage and yet the homopolar generator normally doesn&#x27;t produce high voltage so if we have some type of capacitor effect that&#x27;s continually adding small currents to get the high voltage phenomenon that still is an anomaly right now serial effect is sort of out of reach for most people but the interesting thing i found was here i started with a sunburst book that dealt with a fellow an earthling having a ufo experience and then i met jon searle who had a ufo experience when he was young started inventing afterwards and then i met roy thornson who developed this amazing inertial propulsion device and he had the same thing had missing time apparently had a ufo experience and then had lots of dreams on building devices and in all three cases the stuff that the earthlings built i wouldn&#x27;t say even compares to what maybe the ets have although we&#x27;re trying our best to reproduce what we have the limited downloads for our filtration system called the brain so um so i i became interested in ufos as well and um and that&#x27;s what my citizens hearing testimony is all about these these trial and error trial and error sequences over decades of my life for the past 40 years and essentially following up any trail that seemed to be viable enough to make sense and of course townsend brown sort of exists through all of that i corresponded with townsend brown as well somewhere i got a couple letters from him when he became involved in the uh petrovoltaic effect after he gave up on electric rhythms so you know all those guys are interesting and i&#x27;m happy that i corresponded with one of the students from jeffermenko&#x27;s university because he ended up following up with jeff menkel&#x27;s company in publishing his books so the gentleman called causality book and electrostatic motors [Music] i was wondering are you working with invisibility at all because we notice you sort of disappear when you leave the your seat there and i&#x27;m going back into the sunset when you got up or you actually disappeared at one point well you know what actually if i could jump in i i did notice tom has a disappearing coffee cup as well yeah i noticed that yes yeah see there it goes yeah it&#x27;s beginning to look like uh abide in signing his uh his presidential orders sometimes invisibility it&#x27;s all yeah that&#x27;s easy well paul did you have a question or will did you have any additional questions okay yeah one of the areas that that we worked in is molecular accelerators and it seems to me that some of the things that you guys are talking about fit within what we do and we get up to 30 mmv from um so these are yeah so i just i threw a helmet that evening that could be part of the effect that&#x27;s all okay you want to go into ben muted though yeah uh uh let me see um ben solomon right okay sir ben are you yeah okay i my question is a little bit broader uh because i&#x27;ve see i saw all your experiments in the research other people have done so i was wondering is can i say or is it 90 of the research into gravity modification is related to electro gravity you could you could lump it into their title i mean it&#x27;s sort of a catch-all for a lot of these experiments but it hasn&#x27;t been defined as a real science yet so there&#x27;s lots of experiments that seem to contribute to that and that&#x27;s when dr ning li likes the separation between magnetoelectric and magnetographic and electrophoretic for veto magnetism i believe she calls in gravitoelectric where does she separate the two she&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t know you&#x27;d have to read her papers to uh to fully grasp to experiments people like to create their own terms to patent the word it becomes patentable that when you do that that&#x27;s the secret of getting a patent create a buzzword and they can&#x27;t search it and never find it all right thank you yeah your goal now paul&#x27;s getting all of these sterile devices from ivan the russians had millions of dollars worth of hardware and he&#x27;s going to be flying to mars pretty soon right paul yeah yeah actually um the one point i want to make is that jeff and minko makes a gravitational law and he he not only attracts uh locations but he also induces velocity and what it says to me that as you go faster the speed of light you you lose gravity and i&#x27;m saying myself i&#x27;d love to prove that i&#x27;d love to prove that but you know we just just not there we&#x27;re just not there thank you paul um does anyone else have questions for tom who who would like to go next let me see i think um i&#x27;m just reading through here lots lots of quotes um ed becknell is is wondering let me see about faraday discs versus homopolar generators uh ed could i get you to unmute sir there we go yeah um let&#x27;s see uh i believe that question came from jeremiah was asking if i was familiar with a faraday disc generator and i was just curious is that the same as a homopolar generator yeah yeah i can uh toss in so there&#x27;s this folklore that the disc in the center of the arv somehow was a high voltage homopolar generator and mark mccandlish had mentioned that it could generate many thousands of volts perhaps uh hundreds of thousands of volts now i&#x27;ve built uh four four homophobia generators the fastest of which was 32 000 rpms which is pretty fast for a homopolar generator and uh i got an amazing four and a half volts out of it which or a homophobia generator is actually quite amazing that&#x27;s a lot of voltage out of one um that&#x27;s about the best i&#x27;ve ever seen they generally generate voltages less than 10 volts at the very most and so the idea of how it could generate anything above that especially into like the ionizing potentials or what would be considered high voltage even in up the field um that&#x27;s just something i&#x27;ve searched a lot for and couldn&#x27;t find any references for i even spent some time looking while mark mccandless was talking about it hoping to get him to speak on some reference but couldn&#x27;t find anything and i&#x27;ve spent many hours so far no references at all so if anybody at all here can show a homophobia generator producing high voltage would be highly interested in seeing that phenomena well that&#x27;s where the serial device with a whole bunch of them around a roller magnet essentially becomes more an interesting geometry so it&#x27;s not homopolar right because it&#x27;s got it&#x27;s got you know dipoles that are rotating very very fast so it&#x27;s a dipole generator with the generally homopolar construction in the center but it&#x27;s a dipole motion the high voltage or the high amps for me to the rotating magnets around the outside that will produce that field right um no but i don&#x27;t have a diagram i can share real quickly but essentially the roller magnets that go around the ring are individual homophobes and and they&#x27;re polarized north and south uh top and bottom so and they&#x27;re road rolling around the ring that&#x27;s the important part they&#x27;re not rotating independently they&#x27;re rolling around the ring so you essentially do get a composite voltage that&#x27;s uh i would say increasing with the rotational speed of the whole companion of that can i point something out real quick tom because i&#x27;ve looked at the diagrams of the magnet configuration that he claims for for the third effect generator and they&#x27;re basically split if you were to take a um if you were to take a cylinder and you were to split it down the side and then you were to twist that split so it wasn&#x27;t facing straight down but so it sort of wrapped around that would make not the top south and the bottom north or the other way around but it would actually make one side generally south and one side generally nor so when it rotates you would have a sinusoidal field that would be generated and if you rolled across a magnetic strip or you put it next to a coil and just simply rotated it you would measure a sinusoid with a coil on the side so that would be a dipole type generator that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m asking is how is it homophore well it&#x27;s both to be to be honest you&#x27;ve got imprinted um horizontal fields that essentially are well what the russians end up using sumerium cobalt into a ferrite uh cylinder and so you do have a sinusoidal imprint on the sides but the top and bottom are north and south so you&#x27;ve got both phenomena but to be honest the high voltage effect is still escapes most of theorists people analyzing that so i i sort of you know just go back to the analytical or the anecdotal stories of various craft that seem to have high voltage effects and as a as a non-theorist you know just an experimenter and engineer i i tend to go straight forward towards what can we actually do in our lab today and when you come down to looking for that kind of information about uh high voltage and homopolar generators there&#x27;s well really everything lacking well jeremiah in terms of experiments um you&#x27;ve mentioned doing some work with jeff menko right have you now with jeff minko now i&#x27;ve never worked with him i i mean tom in your opinion because i know jeremiah and mark are always looking for stuff to experiment with do you think that that might be an area where they might be able to do some interesting experiments well jeffy menko&#x27;s book on electrostatic motors is definitely a wealth of information on do-it-yourself things you can build including we reprinted one article from popular science that tells you exactly how to build uh an acrylic from electrostatic motor so there are experiments that people can do at home to get high voltage from the atmosphere and that&#x27;s what deaf mencor is also famous for okay it looks like uh tony uh did you have a question sir it looks like you&#x27;re on muted yeah um this is kind of directed towards tom but that guy anderson who gave that presentation on his device coffee several years ago i argued at that meeting that he was creating a homopolar generator that had dielectrics on the inside such such he was charging the inside electrode and then getting high voltage out on the uh inside electrode anderson was the guy&#x27;s name yeah he had that model that he always brought with him with the magnets rotating around he had a company where he was they was claiming to get out you know 100 something volts out of out of it right right yeah he&#x27;s a great supporter of john searle&#x27;s device and yeah and unfortunately the model it looks very nice when you push it so that the roller magnets keep going around for a while and then slow down well that&#x27;s kind of not the point this the fact that he was rotating around he&#x27;s basically charging one one uh capacitor of a dielectric with the charges from the homopolar generator so that the inside one which is which actually had a smaller area so the voltage goes up on the inside dielectric so you can end up so there is a mechanism with that device for getting higher voltage out of a homopolar generator of that type thank you that&#x27;s a very good point i forgot the capacitive effects of the string magnets of the rings themselves and that would be a good experiment to try with these guys if they want to do something well paul the murad should be doing that for us well i think cyril&#x27;s device and anderson&#x27;s device is a little bit different you know anderson was actually using uh electromagnetics to cause the rotation around so it wasn&#x27;t so he was putting energy into the system to get energy out but the fact that it&#x27;s a homopolar type generator getting high voltages is what i&#x27;m trying to point out yeah yeah definitely so an experiment waiting to happen yeah hey tom give me a break well i um yeah actually paul since you jumped in um h.t alvarez had asked if i could squeeze this in real quick he&#x27;d asked um about the amount of gravity in a warp bubble and he he it was he said he had a related question similar to paul murad uh in in wondering if anybody was working on an answer for that um or paul palmer is i i can&#x27;t help but uh just look for the unknowns out there and see what&#x27;s going on that&#x27;s right um i guess one of the viewpoints i used to have was that this stuff about these ufos being in bubbles is ridiculous um now i begin to believe that it&#x27;s not the case and the question here is what do we have to do other than electromagnetics um the only thing we can say is maybe there&#x27;s a torsion field but what does that mean in other words uh it&#x27;s like looking at dark matter what&#x27;s a wimp it has no electricity it has no charge and then what is it it&#x27;s just black give me a break um so this bubble apparently can do something either in space or underwater and i think the best way of looking at it is that this thing called einstein rings so all i&#x27;m suggesting is you might be interested in that okay and thank you paul uh let me go to gravity alchemist sir he&#x27;s had his hand up for quite a while hi hi hey welcome back great thanks can you hear me yeah he&#x27;s so wonderful sir go for it okay hey well uh we were talking about homopolar motors uh generating electricity etc uh i came across a youtube channel ufo politics i don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever seen ufo politics channel and he follows uh this fella that&#x27;s kind of on the edge with a lot of magnetism his name&#x27;s ken wheeler and uh ken wheelers you know took some magnetic uh viewing film and puts it on a uh on a cylinder magnet and you can see in the cylinder magnet there&#x27;s this uh he calls it a line of uh inertia or uh you you can see it underneath the uh the magnetism film uh the the viewing film and is what this guy does he takes a a cylinder magnet puts a coil on it and he has another uh he has a bar of iron that&#x27;s the same size as the magnet so what he does is he puts the bar of iron and connects it to the magnet when he does that inertia plane uh moves up towards the bar of of of iron that he connects to the magnet so you can see this inertia plane going up and down inside the magnet as he the magnus doesn&#x27;t move he just puts a piece of iron on it and uh and then he has the the the uh elect the uh coil of copper wires connected to a uh an oscilloscope so he can measure uh the voltage that he gets so you know i was always thought you know you had to rotate the magnet to get an electric induction but uh nothing moves except he just puts a piece of iron on it and gets a pulse and then i guess if and if you put on the other end he gets a pulse a negative pulse he puts it on on the north pole he gets a positive and on the south pole he gets a negative pulse but i thought that it was like a little uh piston that goes up and down and it&#x27;s really interesting so i don&#x27;t know if anybody&#x27;s ever done that or looked into that but i just thought i&#x27;d throw it out there if they wanted if anybody wanted to check that or if you could explain to me what he&#x27;s doing did you um i i missed just i stepped out of the room for a second while you were talking about the name of the guy who uh who you&#x27;re referring to and i caught everything else except for his name oh his little magnet by the way a neodymium magnet that&#x27;s been stripped of its coating because as you know the plating that they have on these things is highly conductive and effectively shorts it out what i found out is if you take a neo magnet like this and you grab the foil around it you&#x27;ve wasted your time because the physical material of the neodymium magnet is effectively a dead short as well it&#x27;s highly conductive so for that you need to use ceramic magnets are something else that&#x27;s not conductive where you can actually get an impulse now i tried that little thing with the coil i tried the neo magnet with the coil with the iron and with another false magnetic field externally and you can&#x27;t get a pulse out of it for obvious reasons that he currencied it but i tried the same thing with a ceramic magnet you get a big old pulse so the ceramic magnets do work because they don&#x27;t short off the eddies that are externally imposed from the magnetic field the shift of the poles that happens when you place the iron against i&#x27;m not sure if you use the neodymium or or or use some kind of different uh uh chemistry of magnet well let me let me jump back in here real quick because because this is this is tom&#x27;s q a session we&#x27;re almost out of time so yeah we&#x27;re because we&#x27;re right yeah okay you guys are working on i can see that i just thought i&#x27;d throw it out there because i thought it was it&#x27;s really interesting this piston of uh inertia plane and counter space yeah well and so yeah we&#x27;re again we&#x27;re almost let&#x27;s do one more question for tom if that&#x27;s okay or tom you were going to share yeah go for it sir any gravity folks came back with the serial device in the background that&#x27;s so weird all right that&#x27;s great i wanted a little bit of a wig attack luckily it&#x27;s being pulled down and anchored okay there&#x27;s my finale the grand finale oh wonderful okay well let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do that then tom i i&#x27;m gonna get i&#x27;m gonna put it back on gal review and everyone please put your hands together and give tom an enormous thank you for a wonderful presentation tremendous okay so let me see</p>
