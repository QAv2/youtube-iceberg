            <p>Meet Gilman Louie, the kingmaker of all kingmakers. He&#x27;s the hidden hand behind the rise of Palunteer, Peter Phil&#x27;s involvement with the CIA. He was a pioneer in the video game industry and has since become a legend in the intelligence community. Louisie co-founded Incel, the CIA venture capital arm in 1999 and served as its first CEO. Beyond supplying early capital and strategic direction to the now notorious Palanteer, Gilman Louise Incitel funded other major technologies that could be weaponized, including geospatial mapping through Keyhole, Inc., which played a lead role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and later became the backbone of Google Maps and Google Earth.</p>
<p>Louie also co-founded America&#x27;s Frontier Fund and Alablie Partners, both of which have been instrumental to the digital military industrial complex&#x27;s rise to power. For two decades, Louisie has been the quiet architect behind building America&#x27;s surveillance state, national security apparatus. The spotlight is long overdue, and so is a hard look at how he&#x27;s currently reshaping America behind the curtain.</p>
