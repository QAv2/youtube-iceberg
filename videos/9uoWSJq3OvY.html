            <p>so this is a plasma mug that&#x27;s the Exciter with four 1.25 volt 1 point four AA batteries in it okay now you&#x27;ll notice that the plasma is static when I approach from the side with a magnet right hand rule applies so it rotates that way when I flip the magnet over and approach with this pole the opposite occurs but what happens when we do this you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;s rotating in that it&#x27;s twisting a and now it&#x27;s rotating at high velocity and there you go and now we put the magnet down and we approach with our hand nothing hey now we pick up the magnet and we can see that it does indeed rotate Wooh all right right so how do we generate electricity we rotate a magnet through the well a magnetic field we move a magnetic field perpendicular to a coil thereby resulting in and I&#x27;ll turn off the well I&#x27;ll move this away from the exiter and you can see up see there okay oh there you go I&#x27;ll turn that off now here we have a plasma globe plasma globe has a a rodent coil with one PB of 20 Gauge by filler there&#x27;s the capacitor there&#x27;s the capacitor with the dodes and the diode is arranged I don&#x27;t know if you can see the lighter well I&#x27;ll turn the flash on you can see the little silver line that way haha there&#x27;s a silver line there&#x27;s a silver line going into the coil coming out of the coil I will turn on the meter which is presently showing us uh 200 zamad volts I will short the capacitor and we can see that it goes way down and starts going back up I&#x27;ll discharge it again there we go and up it goes up it goes up it goes now explain that to me Batman</p>
