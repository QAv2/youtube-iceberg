            <p>let me start the q a out by asking so you&#x27;d work with claude power you know a fair amount about what he was doing now that&#x27;s something that actually mark and several of the other people in this conference are familiar with as well his work is not as well known as poglanov&#x27;s but it&#x27;s very interesting and he claimed to get some results what are your thought on him specifically so my impression so like for example again he&#x27;s a very bright guy he&#x27;s got his masters and you know he&#x27;s uh he&#x27;s you know fairly well trained uh pohair is in a completely different category um the man is absolutely brilliant i watched him doing uh calculations in his head that i couldn&#x27;t do with a calculator when i was really good at this stuff back in the day he was just ripping it out he is a professional he has a lot of experience with aerospace he has connections at nasa everybody&#x27;s well respected in the space so he&#x27;s a serious operator i went he showed me his lab we went and did some things down there it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a good lab it&#x27;s small you know but it&#x27;s in in his uh and toulouse there and he&#x27;s very disciplined in his work right so i would say if he does a calculation on it you know the only thing you know you could argue with him is he&#x27;s got this pendulum thing that he uses to measure the um measure the thrust that it&#x27;s putting out and people have criticized and say oh maybe that&#x27;s an electromagnetic artifact or whatever so you could you could maybe go after that but if if the measurements from that are correct his calculations would be dead on the money in my opinion right when he showed me that chart that would be correct if he tells me oh this is related to tel aviv experiments i would i would take it quite seriously i would look at it which is what i did right so that&#x27;s my general impression of him and he had some great um applications you know when i met him he was looking at micro thrusters for satellite applications now from my side i come from an aerospace background at northrop grumman i know the the ramp to get that to get something into space like i talked with the director of the air force research lab about this it&#x27;s like a seven year minimum ram to go from i got a new thing to uh it&#x27;s going to be flying around in space and the only way and that&#x27;s with that&#x27;s if you partner up with an existing supplier that knows the supply chain if you&#x27;re trying to do it on your own he says you might be dead before your network gets in the space i said okay and so he knows that that that space very well so that was probably a really good application that he he was targeting you know initially uh his wife is a medical doctor and she had a great application which i thought was phenomenal and it worked like this um i think i can talk about it because i didn&#x27;t i think she&#x27;s not trying to keep it a secret or anything but basically she took that same gravity wave or whatever you want to call it the sports beam and she being the medical doctor was looking at it for medical imaging and i thought this is fantastic and she said i said how it works well it&#x27;s a gravity wave so your body is going to absorb it at different rates your bone would absorb it differently than muscle tissue then you know organs are fat or whatever and i said okay on the back end we&#x27;re looking at piezo sensors right yep and they said the idea here would be to get the tiniest piezo sensors you could and get a whole bunch of them millions like like you would do like for a tv right a large screen tv and so i went out and did some research for her and i found a japanese company that indeed makes those those piezo sensors really tiny you could make an array of them and have you know i don&#x27;t know how many but good resolution right so you could you could stand someone in front of this screen if you will of piezo sensors and you&#x27;d fire this thing and they&#x27;d feel like a gravity push right be like a g-force push it&#x27;s not ionizing we knew that right from the claude had done a bunch of measurements on this radiation you know so it should be safe you obviously want to do a lot of safety testing before you try this but and you get this image so imagine that you um instead of going in for an mri and sitting in that machine and the magnets bouncing around banging around you could just have a single pulse and get an image maybe turn do another one or localize it the focal length right and just i thought that was really really good idea i don&#x27;t know if she pursued it but that was i thought that was a really really good application so those are my impressions of both the uh claude pohair and his wife she&#x27;s quite quite brilliant well thank you thank you let me go to jeremy reese next he&#x27;s got his hand up there jeremy go for it sir okay there we go now we&#x27;re unmuted all right so um a couple things that you mentioned in your your your thoughts which were uh that was awesome by the way um i wanted to um you&#x27;d mention the word ether which is you know like a hundred a really old term that&#x27;s been thrown around and it&#x27;s kind of unsure what you what we were talking about here with the with regards to the ether and i think that um many of these uh scientists over the past 10 to 20 years have really defined specif more specifically what an ether is or what the ether is and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s an unru radiation bath i don&#x27;t know if anyone else could correct me or kind of elaborate on this but essentially that there there&#x27;s this background microwave background radiation that&#x27;s just ever present everywhere in the the universe and that there&#x27;s also um an ever-present exchange of electromagnetic energy and photonic energy between all parts of the system at any given time so i think that uh it&#x27;s well i think i like that model of the unreal radiation is that that&#x27;s this it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s u n r u h um if you wanna look it up and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this idea that there&#x27;s this this radiation bath that sort of holds everything together and connects it in a matrix and uh that&#x27;s what jud that&#x27;s what gives you know uh rise to space which space is essentially a structure um which is create created by the path of photons and through space right so um yeah i wanted to elaborate on that then the only other thing that um you had just mentioned was um you uh you had worked with claude poher and uh you said that um there was something else that we had just talked about with regards to cloud um um okay yeah i wanted to talk about um this idea of uh in conjunction with some of the ideas that you had about the craft so um the idea is that we could use microwaves to sort of elim you know you have to kind of move move the uh air out of the way and air is relatively easy to move out of the way so is water if you have the right physics the south korea and has already posted their videos of their super cavitating torpedo technology and if it works in water you damn right it works in air as well so there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a number of uh you know countries already looking into this super cavitating technology um in conjunction with uh with the this other the the the other propulsion tech because once you can get this once you can force something and get it going really fast and get it going um you then need to move the air out the way uh in order to get going faster you know so uh there there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a whole bunch of puzzle pieces beyond just uh propulsion that are involved in this whole uap issue that we we want to um address and talk about um one of the things that it was interesting that came to mind as you talked about these left-handed meta materials meta materials you know specifically left-handed meta materials where they have uh negative permittivity but some some that also can exhibit a negative permit permeability as well and the very odd um uh optical effects that can occur with those types of materials where it&#x27;s it&#x27;s essentially like the skin of the craft if it were a left-handed meta material would um essentially it would turn it completely invisible it would like almost implode the optical illusion of space time around that that you know object and if you could combine that type of technology with of course the super cavitating tech um it you know you bla you you essentially you blast a laser beam straight ahead of you really really small and energized just a short distance maybe like 20 feet or that&#x27;s going to be calculated because of course if you&#x27;re going through swamp gas or or water you&#x27;re probably going to have to um you know readjust how that works but it&#x27;s essentially like a laser that focuses on a point and right in front of the craft or a line of points in front of the craft and it um it puts so much energy into that in such a small space that it super cavitates and that super cavitation effect causes you know that bubble that that super cavitating bubble um and you want to time it right so that you fall through that the hole created by the super cavitating bubble in front of the of your craft as you travel so i think that as long as you have the right physics there you you can do it i think that with the in conjunction with these uh these other types of left-handed metamaterial skin coatings they could potentially um you know do other space-time warping effects where you you uh you know you pump a lot of and you pump a lot of optical energy into this this type of thing so this whole idea of you know what a crooks interferometer is right yes so it&#x27;s weird that photons have momentum it&#x27;s proven with the with the group with the crooks interferometer that photons have momentum and that momentum is is a is a as could be a potential source of gravity if we um have the right mathematics and understand the interactions you know properly in the inner the dissipation of of energy and the exchanges that are taking place um so it&#x27;s funny you bring up super cavitation yeah because i have some experience with that so there was some group of scientists that were doing some research and they asked me to come over the lab so i went they were looking for funding and we were looking at it as a way or they were looking at it to use it to split um h2o cheap you know cheap way to split h2o you know and i looked at the demonstration whatever and i understand the principle what you&#x27;re talking about i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s like depending on like if you look at these these nutty craft that fly around i you&#x27;d have to have some really high speed switching to like if you&#x27;re going one direction you decide you&#x27;re going to make a right you have to you have to switch that cavitation to this other direction i don&#x27;t know how would how react in different uh medium density you know like if you&#x27;re in water you know you have to do a lot of adjustment to it you&#x27;d have to constantly be adjusting this thing just like you do with hypersonic right if you&#x27;re going through this atmosphere layers atmospheric layers and accounting even pollution is a big deal with the hypersonics right so you&#x27;d have to do that my thought was more like if you have this weird field and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s extruding from the on the skin of the craft would that just in and of itself change the physics of of of drag would it be like a quasi crystal you familiar with the quasi-crystal concept right yeah so um crystals amorphous uh metal amorphous materials or glass and then quasi crystals are like the main three um structural forms of matter you know random or randomly oriented crystalline or oriented and then uh quasi-crystalline and then the quasi crystals right so i have a set of pots and pans i bought from france that are supposedly quasi crystals right which would mean that they would be non-stick hundred percent it&#x27;s a marketing thing they stick things stick in there but it is really slippery but in theory another physicist explain he said if you can have the perfect closet crystal it would be you know frictionless right frictionless material i say okay well i&#x27;m still waiting for those pants to come out i&#x27;ll have to do a teflon and my uh citroen pens or whatever for now wow could you imagine that if it was if it was um more more durable than teflon and didn&#x27;t have like the cancerous by-products this is this is regular metal but unfortunately it&#x27;s from citroen you know the french company which is i have a lot of trim cookware and i was like wow great this is gonna be you know nonstick but with just metal no no teflon no no no none of that but it didn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t live up to actually one of them pitted really bad because i left the sauce in it and the acetate through through them through the coating and that was the end of that but the idea would be electromagnetic quasi-crystal type action right so like this field that we were talking about this this non-orbital you know material that&#x27;s you know exuding this field outside the skin would basically might change the physics of when for example water air molecules or whatever come in contact with the skin uh instead of like rubbing against it do they get i don&#x27;t know is there some sort of maybe remy could chime in but would there be some sort of um it&#x27;s called laminar flow laminar flow correct yep and right you want to um you want to create like that a super cavitated bubble around just the surface of the craft so it doesn&#x27;t actually come into contact with anything right that would work that&#x27;s correct the idea yeah you blast that if you blast that super cavitating bubble in front of the craft and you&#x27;re traveling fast enough and you&#x27;re continuing along the line blasting that bubble in front of yourself and just falling through the hole that it creates that would definitely work that was a big thing when i was a kid my dad explained that that to me about ufos and he said um it was basically what you what you&#x27;re talking about that was a big theory back in the 60s uh i guess since the 70s of how are they using light they&#x27;re they&#x27;re using light to push around so they have a lot of light trapped inside of them and they can they can create or generate light through through i don&#x27;t know whatever energy exchanges they&#x27;re using they can create and generate large amounts of light as thrust and i don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s another effect that goes on at the surface of the craft um you&#x27;ve seen that those um videos from uap theory dot com where he goes and he goes into a couple of very interesting cases of uap where where they have uh like a mirror lens it looks like it looks like a mirror distortion like almost like what&#x27;s called um an einstein um einstein ring yeah well well jeremy if it&#x27;s okay i want to jump over if it&#x27;s okay let me jump to remy for questions and then come back and i i just don&#x27;t want to take cool stuff man though i thank you for presenting and and okay yeah thank you for whatever it&#x27;s worth i hope it you know spark some some ideas yeah so let me go to remy and then michael boyd after that remy go for it sir yeah thanks sir jeremy that&#x27;s interesting and steve i was very interesting what steve says as well um i like this idea that you saw did you see what i put up on the chat there with the frog levitating the high magnetic field maybe it&#x27;s something like that inside this cross like you like he&#x27;s saying like an inertial dampener you set up this standing wave and it kind of pins you to the craft and then you get this kind of effenescent wave outside the craft which i mean the accounts that these craft don&#x27;t generate sonic booms so i think steve&#x27;s onto that something there that&#x27;s that&#x27;s sort of what i wanted to say right and as regards jeremy what jeremy&#x27;s saying as well i think that&#x27;s interesting that&#x27;s interesting too i mean i think you can you know he&#x27;s talking about laminar flow and so forth i think if you have a air bubble surrounds whatever say torpedo it slips through the medium you you release uh bubbles around it and it slips through the medium much easier much more easily and i think sharp skin does the same thing it doesn&#x27;t have a smooth skin as you think it has a rough skin and somehow that allows it to slip through the water so there may be something to what jeremy is saying too that&#x27;s that&#x27;s all i had to say yeah i appreciate that remy yeah i was thinking about because i was studying the hypersonics and obviously the sonic boom you know problem right shock wave collapse and whatever and yeah i just wonder if you had a low drag coefficient um and you&#x27;re moving the thing through are you going to get those shock weight build up so you&#x27;re going to get the sonic boom i don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a good question though i have a quick question yeah go go for it michael shoot oh whoa hey could you could i trouble you turn your camera on though if that&#x27;s okay okay thank you sir sure so uh what is how would you define a non-orbital or semi-orbital material right so if you go like i&#x27;m speaking from group three five nitrides right so you can for example go and google uh seaplane and plane peopling right in that space because that&#x27;s where i&#x27;m speaking from and basically uh and i can send a link out if everybody&#x27;s interested in and that sort of thing and i think it&#x27;s interesting myself so um but basically seaplane when you have a crystal uh structure you always start with the substrate right so we would use either sapphire or silicon carbide right such a nice structure there and you would get an orientation from it right you would um one-on-one orientation is crystal orientation and when you&#x27;re growing crystal on it uh for example you&#x27;re growing gallium nitride or indian if it&#x27;s seaplane it&#x27;s basically going to grow sideways and what that means from a physics standpoint is the electrons in orbit in the material are going to are going to remain in that lead that layer you&#x27;ve grown when you fire it up and use it as for example a led light or whatever or a laser whatever let&#x27;s just stick with the led light because it&#x27;s simple when you fire it up the electrons are basically self-contained in the material and at the surface of the material there&#x27;s very little of this uh what would we call these pi electrons or or their orphans that would go out into into space above the surface of the material right if you grow them semi-polar which is like this let&#x27;s say um some of the orbits are going to escape from the material not all but a fair amount right because it&#x27;s at an angle it&#x27;s polarized correct it&#x27;s polarized non-polarized you know polar non-polar and and semi semi-polar in the semiconductor world that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m speaking from and and then when you go to non-polar which we call p-plane that&#x27;s where the the crystals are growing straight up right these are hexagonal crystals you&#x27;re dealing with here and um really tricky because what they want to do is fall down it&#x27;s very unstable very unstable it grows straight up actually the the chief scientist from darpa he&#x27;s like we try you know we&#x27;re trying to do this in our labs and he&#x27;s like the slightest uh energy burst like when you&#x27;re using let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re using heat or lasers or whatever you&#x27;re using to center this stuff and make it grow and then obviously you&#x27;re going to activate it right that&#x27;s the final step the slightest uh increase and all the blades of grass just fall over flat where they want to be in in and and it&#x27;s basically you might as well say the time and went with c plane which is really cheap to do and that&#x27;s what i did and what everybody does so the idea that i had was and again the physics of it are if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s non-orbital you get a lot of electrons that are uh going to escape from the surface of the of the material and i guess from a performance standpoint when you have that unstable or semi unstable material that when you for example use it to make a light or a laser you&#x27;re going to get extreme performance out of it right as opposed to the seaplane or even the the semi-polar crystals right and this stuck in my head is the thing to look at um but if you if you&#x27;re interested in the physics of it just google um gan gallium nitride and then uh seaplane and plane p-plane you&#x27;ll see it come up and then you&#x27;ll see some recent articles talking about the the non-orbital p-plane stuff and the promise it holds for the future and what you can do with it and so forth um so also i guess uh is this just for three five semiconductors or all direct bandgap stuff probably for all direct band gap but i can&#x27;t speak to that because my expertise is solidly in three five nitrides so in that world like if you google it comes up right away like if you just google p-plane c-plane m-plane it right away comes up uh nitrites because that&#x27;s the name of the game in the nitride space is can you can you grow this way can you grow this way you can you know and then obviously cost effectively and so forth but it&#x27;s a great material i mean ngan is great because you can tune it the frequency of the thing the band gap you can tune it just by changing the ratio of indium and gallium right when do you think we&#x27;ll get to aluminum nitride uh do you have it right now i mean like is everywhere infidelity is the others yeah the one that interests me the most but i talked to the ceo of a company that&#x27;s building stuff in massachusetts is is indium phosphide for switching applications it&#x27;s really high performance stuff but obviously very tricky to make you know as with everything um what else in that world was interesting i think just just understanding that the less stable the material is if you can get it to to set up and activate it your performance uh characteristics go go way up that that that was the interesting takeaway from all that that makes sense i mean i&#x27;m curious though why um they don&#x27;t use adsorption chemistry to their advantage what temperature range is this uh yeah you&#x27;re talking about the right you&#x27;re asking the right questions here so when i entered the space the problem was for let&#x27;s say for dan or ingan was you&#x27;re you&#x27;re talking about five six hundred c to to to activate it to crystallize and so forth that&#x27;s a problem problem number one thermal coefficient of expansion right so you have this substrate let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re an enterprising young man you say i&#x27;m going to use silicon carbide so you&#x27;ll get the tc of that right then you look at you have lattice mismatch issues right which you can solve with buffers right you can lay down buffers aluminum is popular there&#x27;s other things you can do to that but you still can&#x27;t get away from the thermal coefficient of expansion so you have your wafer and let&#x27;s say you want to go with a nice hundred millimeter wafer big size so it&#x27;s cheap to make and you lay the can or in-game down on it you get it to crystallize it&#x27;s at 500 or 600 c and as you&#x27;re cooling it the thing starts bowing up right i actually talked to the ceo of companies when he was trying this in his his thing and he said i went over to it with the tweezers and i grabbed the end of it it just shattered because of the stress it was under and that&#x27;s why they were all doing these small wafers right for that tce issue um what i was looking to do in my company the reason i put all that money and time into it was to drop that to 300 c if i could less than 400 300 like in the range where you could use caps on polymod right which is the stuff they used to put on the hard drive it&#x27;s a plastic type you get it from dupont and special stuff and i was thinking this would be great if we could put it on caps on and get it to lay up if i could add something um also at three once you get to 300c now you can start using organic solvents potentially yeah and that that is what opens up all the adsorption chemistry that allows you to limit the crystal growth in certain directions much more easily right yeah there&#x27;s all kinds of things that open up at low temp i recommend trying problems i recommend trying borax and erythritol it&#x27;s an interesting solvent it&#x27;s a yeah well i don&#x27;t know actually that might um no not for your application not with nitrides um we were using chemical etch for it you know for the lithography side and jump in we&#x27;ll talk about it well yeah i mean yeah i&#x27;d love to you know the one thing that i wish we would have tried was graphene i so wish we would have done that we might have succeeded i mean our main competitor did succeed and they have the current record for solar efficiency at 43 and a half percent nice and we were stuck you know the problem was we were stuck with the same problem they were which is we were trying to make the in-game graded again right so you have different band gaps that respond to different photon uh colors let&#x27;s call it right of the sun and you could tune this material and you know they were transparent if you did the the the wider ones at the top narrow at the bottom the sunlight would get through and you would get this this massive it has a 70 something percent theoretical efficiency of the sun that&#x27;s why i targeted it but the problem was when we were as you start adding indium to it we had the low temperature things we used a different type of physics to to set it up we weren&#x27;t using the heat primarily using something else right something else to to basically saturate the the atomic structure with energy so that it would it would crystallize and then activate you have to activate it obviously with dopants and whatever but in this case so the ingan so we were playing with it and we kept hitting a wall where if we added too much indium into it it would face separate it would phase separate we were beating ourselves for a couple of years on this problem never occurred to me i mean i did ask the guys i said why do we do a tandem cell right where we go with the indium content stop and then do something else but then you have current mismatches right you have tunnel junction diodes you have to engineer into the material so in the end we kind of stuck with that we didn&#x27;t have the budget to try for a tandem cell right multi-junction cells are just harder yeah correct right you know about that so our competitor did this they would work in the same material system i met with them and i met the vc that was backing them out in the silicon valley and what they did they hit the same wall we hit the indian wall so they stopped they had a nice graded multi-junction you know multi-band gap you know layer and they did the second layer they used different i don&#x27;t know if it was germanium something right to pick up the other band gap that were missing from the high indium content and they engine engineered the current matching so that you know because they&#x27;ll if they&#x27;re doing two different currents that one will drain the other you have to kind of cur you know match the currents from the two levels and you have an insulator between them and they did it and they hit the record man they hit it at 40 percent 38 at first they got it up to 43 and a half and they&#x27;re using that stuff i think they were going to use it in the these concentrated photovoltaics right cpv you know we have all these mirrors and it&#x27;s concentrated and handle like 500 suns and you know it&#x27;s really as good this stuff will handle high temperature you know an in-game solar cell it will handle high radiation i did the math with the air force it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll it&#x27;ll be good in space for 150 years yeah without if you have a very expensive material might as well get as much energy on that surface area as possible right and in space the other problem with solar is degradation from radiation right radiation hardness that&#x27;s the name of the game up there it&#x27;s weight is one thing because it&#x27;s about ten thousand dollars a pound to get it up there and then the other thing is obviously vibration with the rocket launch you want to you know survive that and then once you&#x27;re up in space and you unfurl its radiation is your problem that will degrade your cells you you just wait till we get the stuff remy&#x27;s team is working on in terms of uh maxwell&#x27;s zombies or whatever uh i mean once you have non-uh ergotic systems like uh you can get crazy efficiencies without even trying uh this fun stuff yeah i mean the basic thing that jack always talks about you know jack safari have you seen his stuff sure all right so he&#x27;s always talking about uh frolic pumped systems that are far from equilibrium as that&#x27;s a little a little bit more to it but yes yeah you know what i&#x27;m saying that theme of having something that&#x27;s unstable and pumping it far from equilibrium you get some some interesting effects and the same thing is true from the semiconductor side they&#x27;re far from equilibrium or they&#x27;re out of equilibrium and they exhibit these characteristics that are very interesting yep so oh okay well michael thank you so let me go to let me see let me go to michael boyd who had asked a question that and when it comes to band gaps and hard drives which steve you mentioned both of those michael boyd is like hardcore to both of those so great he he&#x27;s your guy michael this is the gentleman i was asking michael yeah yeah he and band gap i i am not not to tease you at all but that is probably the word he&#x27;s used more than anything else in the last couple of weeks so we&#x27;ve got a band yet even time i&#x27;m almost out of my dinner so um you were talking about this idea of basically uh gravitational or space-time metric engineering basically is what we&#x27;re talking about materials and it sounds like you&#x27;re pretty pretty knowledgeable about oh michael i&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re you&#x27;re uh your mic is fading out for some reason how how is this better yeah better now thank you sorry so um you&#x27;re are you uh steve are you familiar with the term lattice matching of course so it&#x27;s the bane of my existence yeah so basically uh when you&#x27;re [Music] yeah you&#x27;re putting a lattice matching layer right you need to have a and one of the ways that they do that is yeah gallium arsenide is a good buffer aluminum you can use right that&#x27;s another good buffer right so like i i worked with mark the mercury mercury cadmium cellulose oh yeah yeah we looked at that toxic they make uh right and so uh what one of the things detection is going to do is we take that when we cut the semiconductors and then we etch off the layer get rid of you grow on top of that right and then we would grow uh what we would call glass or some kind of uh silicon oxide right that&#x27;s a whole industry unto itself that&#x27;s right that would be a type of passivation layer that you would use commonly and so what we would do and then what i got a patent on is i would take when i was doing that process i put a bright light on and what that would do is it would polarize the dielectric and that would make it more resistant correct the light is the key what what frequency light did you use this is like back in there oh so white light it was just like uh a uh a xenon lamp an incandescent lamp like that yeah one of those bright thousand watt ones or something right right that&#x27;s what we were using we were playing with uh different frequencies and you got different results based on the frequency certainly so basically uh what you&#x27;re doing there is you&#x27;re you&#x27;re changing the dielectric properties of it correct that&#x27;s one thing you&#x27;re doing that&#x27;s right one thing that&#x27;s a result and and so but my point here is in order for this thing to not build up charge at the interface you had to add smoke you had to get because if you did then there are these little little uh what we call dangling bonds or traps with traffic right that&#x27;s right trap charges that created in the silicon oxide it wasn&#x27;t a crystal it was amorphous it was a glass right right that meant there was a lot it wasn&#x27;t sio2 it was s-i-o-x right psiox so you had these what i call dangling bonds right put that in a gamma ray source it would like disintegrate right disintegrate and still be there it just would be like a garbage like a short yeah yeah that&#x27;s right okay and so the way we developed to get around that is we came up with other passivation called silicon nitride right okay si3n4 yeah that would and we could lattice match that to in this case we&#x27;re using uh indian independent uh indian and gemini and it&#x27;s like a five speed that&#x27;s tim tin right indian indian is ion sp would be stybium right uh anime tin antimony 10 right okay so um in any case that was the material and both of them are what&#x27;s called a zinc blade you know what i mean by that it&#x27;s like a diamond lattice yeah yeah yeah and that&#x27;s how we would match it okay now the reason i&#x27;m going through all these details is to try and explain to you how that works with the gravitational energy okay get to that let&#x27;s see that so now you you have this whole lattice these two asses you&#x27;re changing the media you&#x27;re going from a dielectric medium to a semiconductor right that&#x27;s right there are two different types of match and there are two different types of uh compositions in that okay right but by matching the interface basically that&#x27;s what makes it so that that it works electrically correct anything happens in gravity with the interface okay so but with gravity it&#x27;s not just the electromagnetic part there&#x27;s what i call a translational part or it&#x27;s like you think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s still but if you get down to the protons they&#x27;re moving they&#x27;re shaking yes okay and the way they shake and they send out these signals when i what i call a song the electron okay so what happens is you got to get the electrons and the protons all shaking and singing and dancing to the same tune and if you do that you can create an artificial medium of space time where it&#x27;s expanded like um more like how put ups you know how put up oh yeah i&#x27;ve talked to him yeah well we talked about expanded space and denser space so when you get closer to [Music] a star right gravity is stronger that and in when you&#x27;re closer to the decreased gravitational field time slows as you get farther away it speeds up so time goes faster in space than it does on earth or outside our galaxy for example so think of outsider that&#x27;s expanded space now get rid of all your electrons and think of just the protons and then you know how you have intrinsic properties to a semiconductor yes so like so there&#x27;s an intrinsic density of protons in outer space that&#x27;s different than it is here on earth so think of the like lattice of just the protons are there without any electrons and they have this little structure to them but they&#x27;re farther apart so you get what i&#x27;m saying so i do i do i&#x27;m thinking spin it like the way i found this is by spinning spinning using spin by the motion everything&#x27;s in motion in our universe there is no there is no uh at risk right right right all mass is relative even absolute motion unto itself yeah right so there&#x27;s nothing sitting still where we&#x27;re moved the earth&#x27;s moving around the sun pretty damn fast and then the sun&#x27;s moving in the arm of the milky way galaxy pretty damn fast and then the galaxies move even faster right well yeah and wouldn&#x27;t that go actually wouldn&#x27;t that go back to what mark so-called working with the alphaphone stuff because even your atoms are spinning right so that&#x27;s the whole point the atoms the the nucleus of the atom that&#x27;s where the gravitational field is carried because that&#x27;s where the mass of matter comes from that&#x27;s why photons don&#x27;t have mass you know we were talking about that in the chat not two two beams of uh photons going past each other the opposite of direction they don&#x27;t attract each other that&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t have any map but matter does and it&#x27;s the protons not the electrons really though you can freeze out essentially the electrons just by pulling down so michael let me just see if i get this straight so the you&#x27;re talking about two different materials for example like you were talking about psyops or whatever and you&#x27;re doing something else so you have two different materials but your lattice matched so everything&#x27;s working together which i know very well right because we had to let us match for our stuff as well you know you had your lattice matching you had your point defects you had your ins interstitial defects and then you had your uh what do you call it thermal coefficient of expansion right which is the you know these are all the challenges we were dealing with we did figure out a way to get rid of the defect stuff really well with our process and we used light to do it we were able to get rid of we were able to push impurities out of the material which is great right depending on the moment i don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re using the board yeah right so we had that we had micro hardness we also observed from this process which is very interesting um and the lattice matching thing is obvious gotta have it you don&#x27;t have a functioning device if the last mismatch is there or if you do it&#x27;s like unstable but i never thought to sit down and say lattice match to similar materials what can you do with them i was more well when i was working on that i was just trying to get the damn thing to work and get out the door and make money right but later i was thinking about when we were talking about superconductors is how would you how would you engineer the material like amended material to get the properties you&#x27;re looking for right how does that work and so that&#x27;s but it&#x27;s kind of over my head every time i read these meta material papers they start talking about ellipses and everything and i&#x27;m kind of semi kind of lost to some sometimes with it it&#x27;s quite quite intricate that i that i put the link in you should check that out because it&#x27;s got some really good information and you put a link in there what you put a link in the chat yeah i put a link up above you know michael i i didn&#x27;t see that either can you tell me what the name is let me look that up it was meta materials maybe you typed that in and it went directly to somebody instead of instead of to everybody [Music] i&#x27;m looking in the chat some really good comments you know i&#x27;m so busy talking i don&#x27;t even read these things yeah well [Music] oh there we go okay so what what uh so what i was talking about though is when you&#x27;re going between one space-time there&#x27;s a difference in the inner atomic difference and what i&#x27;m talking about is the protons are like sit there still virtually being in the crystal but the crystal lattice dimensions are different so you have to figure out a way to get between those two dimensions and that&#x27;s where the this uh what i call vibrational mode thing comes in so you get them both vibra or debate they&#x27;re not really vibrating it&#x27;s it&#x27;s more of a spin state right but you get these two mediums into a a spin state where they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re basically uh synchronized and the way i like to think about it is like a capacity okay and you can you can uh you have like a and that&#x27;s why this book is good because it has uh uh you know a double negative dielectric there&#x27;s a permanent type in the permeability or both and if you put them both if you get these two dielectrics next to each other you can basically make that disappear make it a uh like optical cloaking essentially we were trying to do the same thing but not optically we&#x27;re trying to do it basically with the space-time movement i got you i got you and so and then you talk about the word ether yeah i use that because i&#x27;m like an old guy like i started studying physics in the 60s the word a lot of the material still had that word in it what&#x27;s the word it&#x27;s like talking about ghosts you know it&#x27;s like talk certain subjects you bring them up and they&#x27;re like taboo okay yeah yeah yeah one of those subjects yeah yeah what do they call it now remy might know what i think they call it they call it vacuum energy okay dark energy but they also talked about like these virtual electrons and positrons popping right right right and all that kind of stuff which i i frankly don&#x27;t buy that i think it&#x27;s my of course i have uh uh what is it called uh i have my own biases does anybody have a copy photons okay are in the flux in the universe and there&#x27;s regions of low flux density like where we are because our sun creates a bubble around it of protons that are coming out from there okay but the intergalactic space has got fire flux density of protons okay but right transit it&#x27;s like an intrinsic value of in and that&#x27;s the energy that we&#x27;re talking about it&#x27;s interesting i&#x27;m moving are creating an energetic field you have to read i&#x27;ll have to read up on it some more the one paper that interested me was uh there was one paper that that albert einstein uh tried to publish he sent it for peer review the the guy that was supposed to you know peer review it sent it to a couple other guys without asking him and they had them pulled the paper right it&#x27;s the only paper that they ever pulled of his never got published and that they had a problem with the title right off the bat which was gravity does not exist right and i&#x27;m trying to read the thing i found a copy of it online in german but it&#x27;s like a photo photograph of it and i was trying to find a text version of it because i&#x27;d love to see what it was uh that he never was able to publish about the subject of gravity and how it works right but i read all of his other papers and he&#x27;s always very careful to to talk about gravity in a certain way and even his colleagues were back in the day about what it is and how does it work but i&#x27;m really curious to see what that paper is that they they rejected of his i don&#x27;t know if anybody knows where i can get a copy in english that&#x27;s the title of it i heard a lot of his work came from his wife maybe behind every man as a woman right i heard that the rumor i heard is that he wasn&#x27;t so good at math no he wasn&#x27;t and his wife was was great at man and he was the front man and and you know in reality even though he won the nobel prize his wife got all the proceeds now i think there&#x27;s a reason for that besides wouldn&#x27;t shock me it wouldn&#x27;t shock me at all but i&#x27;d love to get a hold of that paper um well i i i was going to say the wife always gets all the proceeds that says nothing in the divorce yeah so well so so michael let me uh let me see if anybody else has questions here um who else has questions for steve i have a question i can&#x27;t go for it harold okay uh but i want to ask you know very interesting conversations a lot of futuristic stuff look like a lot of promising research so i asked you give me what do you see coming on the pipeline in terms of gravity research anti-gravity material that will help a spaceship better especially for the military in the near future what do you see there give me your educated guess okay my guess is a low-budget version of it which i think they might already have i should elaborate a little bit on this right i&#x27;m pretty sure they have what we&#x27;re talking about and i&#x27;ll tell you why i think that i used to live in arizona in uh a town called uh maricopa right it&#x27;s just south of phoenix near casa grande if you know the area huh that&#x27;s all over the news now with all that was happening there oh okay i didn&#x27;t know um but i lived there i had a house and there was a there&#x27;s a highway that goes from phoenix out there right it&#x27;s really long dark at night some parts are lit some parts aren&#x27;t i drove up and down that that was the only way to get to phoenix there&#x27;s one road right and if there was a traffic accident you&#x27;re there for hours but anyway on this road i noticed uh i was driving with a friend and he&#x27;s in the construction business and there was this it&#x27;s all indian reservation wild horses and whatever there&#x27;s nothing out there absolutely nothing and all of a sudden there&#x27;s this one ranch house on reservation land with a long driveway off the road and how much it looked pretty pretty whatever and he said well yeah he pointed that ranch house to me and i said yeah i&#x27;ve seen it a million times it&#x27;s probably you know owned by the the the tribal people he says i don&#x27;t think so this is number one look at it and they said yeah it looks like a maybe a two-bedroom ranch maybe maybe that he says how many cars and vans are outside of it my spot is like a dozen he says where are all the people they&#x27;re not out on the ranch so they must be in the house and if they&#x27;re in the house they&#x27;re standing shoulder to shoulder there&#x27;s no way to move i said okay i&#x27;m a little okay fine but then he pointed up to the power uh for it so the power lines are up there you have main power lines to run out to maricopa and beyond and he&#x27;s like you see that that transformer up on the pole there i said yeah he says that&#x27;s not for a house steve that&#x27;s for a factory they&#x27;re running enough power to that house to power a factory so i said okay so i called up a buddy on the east coast that works in defense and i said if you guys have an operation going there the locals are getting suspicious right so i think it was like a month later they put this sign they built a little sign thing at the front it was like one of those brick things and they put a sign on it it said u.s space command so apparently my body was right it&#x27;s some sort of underground thing and they put this thing on your space command and then so that was there for a while then they took the emblem off and they put another one on it it said something else us air force something or other then they took that one off and put something else and finally they just took it off in this there&#x27;s this placard there sitting there but here&#x27;s the interesting part of the story so i was driving on that same road with a couple uh a married couple and we happen to be discussing these topics about ufos uaps and so forth and lo and behold right over where that that location was was this triangular craft it was massive massive it was lit on the edges it was sitting there you know we pulled over thing was dead silent i&#x27;m going to say 2000 feet up directly above that you know whatever you want to call it space command thing and we&#x27;re watching it they wanted to take pictures and i discouraged them you know because i i figured it was one of our craft you know and then the thing just took off so fast you couldn&#x27;t you couldn&#x27;t follow with your eye it was gone right and silent too there was no noise so i&#x27;m pretty sure they have something cooking there right in other words the things we&#x27;re talking about the military probably has a lot of this stuff i think they have a low budget version as well which is like where they took like some a-10 warthogs and and maybe some other aircraft and rather than spending all the money to to to make them you know you take an existing aircraft right and you put in some sort of a you know a lifter if you want to call it that or some sort of you know part of the system that just gives it lift nothing else not propulsion nothing else right and so budget wise you&#x27;ve just got that and you have this craft and again linda moulton house somebody sent in photographs of these things i looked at them very carefully and they were reporting that they had sounds of jet engines like right over their house really loud and then they would cut out right and then they would start up again and cut out they couldn&#x27;t see anything they&#x27;re looking up in the sky and so forth and imagine a low budget version where the where you get it like a like an aircraft like a warthog it&#x27;s got the lifter so you take off you do a short takeoff and landing situation right but you&#x27;re using your regular jet engines okay and you just fire the engines up for a while and then coast and you could use the the regular you know ailerons and everything to to to go you can even go to the jet stream and ride that for a while all without burning fuel and silently too if you don&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not running the jets and if you turn the jets off once they cool off you won&#x27;t have a thermal signature so that&#x27;s pretty good right and then finally these craft they said they were invisible and i saw the photo somebody took a photo of them when they were i would call it decloaked and they were all white every part of the plane was white and i could see the four they had four 810 uh you know warthog aircraft and then they had a refilling tanker with it which i recognized as kc i don&#x27;t remember what the designation was and then that thing had this weird popsicle stick i call it on the back on the tail so it was strange they were all white and i i thought maybe they put a coating on it where they could energize it and it would it would have you know be invisible negative index of refraction type situation and if you look at that that&#x27;s a cheap way to to get tactical or strategic advantage without spending a ton of money you know you coat your craft with something that makes it invisible to radar and also visual light you put this little one lifter or whatever they are to to get rid of the lift issue and you use your standard jets and jet fuel to to propel it around but if you think about it from a conduct combat scenario you could get these things near the theater and get them going at a pretty good speed and then shut off the engines and let them cool off and you&#x27;d essentially be invisible and silent and then you could attack from the air so i think i think they&#x27;re already doing things like what we&#x27;re talking about for the future i guess just imagine that they&#x27;re continually you know improving and dropping the cost you know but the one thing when i saw that triangular craft the only thing i could think of was how long were they doing this and how much did it cost was it 50 billion was it 100 billion was it 10 years was it 30 years how much went into it how many people died you know test test pilots scientists who knows that that&#x27;s all i could think of was cost you know look like you know that was very perceptive of you to notice that transformer because looks like when they install it everybody else missed the the clues what it would give out and i&#x27;m going to ask your next question because you know a lot and i want to take it to the edge now about 10 years ago maybe more than 10 years ago i saw that the japanese did you know the invisibility cloak and all in the video it worked so extremely well it was incredible now i had never heard of anybody you know in the defense department or any project or anything that they&#x27;re using that invisibility cloak to be you know to make airplanes invisible they talk about you know the black project and so on you know like the f1 114 uh in this world but i never heard of that i mean what do you know about that i mean have they done any project like that in which they can shrouded with invisibility with metamaterial however they do it but i know that japanese did a very good job when when i left defense the the whole thing and i worked on some of these projects was we had low observable then we had vlo right so we had lo then vlo which is very low observable then we had elo which is extremely low observable and this had to do with coatings and whatever which are you know you can just look this up on the internet now it&#x27;s pretty it&#x27;s anti-reflective coatings for for radar essentially right when i worked in defense we had these coatings for the um for uh for the for the military aircraft and one day some of the guys took a van and they put this special paint on it it you had to bake it in an oven to secure it so we put it in the oven or whatever and then it was that we had it on the runway and we had a cop that we knew come in with his radar gun and a van is probably the easiest thing to track on with the radar right because it&#x27;s flat sided the hardest thing to track is is a vw uh beetle with rounded rounded surfaces really tough but this one was easy right and he stood on the side of the runway and somebody drove up on him doing about 80 and it didn&#x27;t even register on his on his radar gun right so those are the types of coatings that we had that when i left um and i knew people that worked on the f-117 you know my friend was the director on the b2 program but we don&#x27;t talk about the the very specific things and they still don&#x27;t talk about those things but all i can say is that that was back in the 80s and early 90s so i would imagine they&#x27;ve progressed quite a bit and from what i could see maybe maybe they have you know conquered some of these issues with uh even even the um what we&#x27;ll call invisibility to to visible light as well i wouldn&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t shock me if that was the case [Music] well i haven&#x27;t heard anybody you know the defense or program anything you know and i was in the air force many years right anybody is thinking of making an airplane optically invisible because for a fighter pilot for example being up in the sky and having an airplane like the invisibility cloak that you don&#x27;t see it with your eyes or with the radar i mean it&#x27;s quite an advantage but i haven&#x27;t yeah no absolutely and if that stuff is going on it&#x27;s going to be in black programs way off to the side servicemen are not going to know about it and the ones that do that interact with the craft that deal with it are going to have these special clearances with lifetime secrecy right you know these i&#x27;ve signed a bunch of them and it&#x27;s just that&#x27;s the way they&#x27;re going to manage it and that&#x27;s the way they should because they&#x27;re spending gobs of money on this stuff and if they do get it they don&#x27;t want to just parade it in front of the public because that also includes our opponents we&#x27;d also see it right right yeah well thank you harold so let me go to mark so-called and we we&#x27;ve got probably just about 15 minutes left steve if you&#x27;re okay with that and yeah sure okay mark go for it sir uh hey steve i&#x27;m here in the falcon space lab um i i heard you talking before about uh inertial mass cancellation or making something uh weightless um that&#x27;s actually something that we&#x27;re working on with the alzafon experiment which is uh we&#x27;re trying to create coherent matter states in the core of the atom like get all the spins oriented okay um what was your theory behind uh what makes uh matter waitlist like yeah first before i say that is there some sort of a link where i can read up on your project because i did see a spreadsheet where you have tasks and everything which look like great project management you&#x27;re doing but is there somewhere i could read on it and see an overview an overview i mean there was presentations here at apec and we just give updates every time i&#x27;m going to show you guys it live in a couple moments okay and you can come down to the lab and uh help out with it hands-on where did you locate it again hawthorne new jersey pawthorne that&#x27;s right well and and mark don&#x27;t don&#x27;t forget in between then and now yeah we do have we do have ken griggs who&#x27;s going to walk us through phoenix theory so oh yeah i&#x27;m really excited to hear about that but um maybe you want to send me a link to it i&#x27;ll read on it before i make any comments you know what i mean i won&#x27;t like immerse myself in it okay okay you know it&#x27;s basic um sam thompson&#x27;s actually holding up the book gravity control with present technology um that is the book that his son wrote uh frederick alzafon&#x27;s son david wrote that book and there&#x27;s gravity control with okay i&#x27;ll google it i&#x27;ll buy a copy let&#x27;s say that that&#x27;s good that&#x27;s an amazon um but the real scientific paper is uh it&#x27;s available online it&#x27;s called anti-gravity with present technology okay let me write that one down okay it&#x27;s from 1981 81 i think i&#x27;ve seen that one i&#x27;ve never read it but i&#x27;ve seen it around yeah that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the um the experiment i&#x27;m working on okay also are you working on any um experiments are you kidding me man i&#x27;m so busy i barely had time for this uh i&#x27;m doing i&#x27;m doing quite a few other different projects completely unrelated to this some some stuff with geopolitical analysis some stuff with uh we&#x27;re looking at crop projections so it&#x27;s for a hedge fund so they make investment decisions based on analysis and uh so that&#x27;s taken up half more than half my time and the other hedge funds stand on anti-gravity investments what is what where&#x27;s the hedge funds in the anti-gravity investment you know it&#x27;s funny i had to chat with uh with eugene and and and uh i said eugene because he sent me his presentation you know his pitch right and i said i know a lot of vc i know a lot of them all of the planet right the big ones and i said none of them have a flying saucer fund right because they go to a vc or whatever they have you know they have your alternative energy guys and then you have your physics and then you have your you know they have everything social media is a big thing whatever and i said i don&#x27;t have a and i said this is usually governments do this type of thing not not private investors i mean it&#x27;s a big it&#x27;s a big ask right so i was like if you can come up with something for alternative energy yeah right away walk in and these guys are throwing money down on it you know so that was my thing then but uh yeah i mean i i the most money i&#x27;ve seen thrown around toward this type of thing is from angels individual investors that are just really just you know fascinated by the field and they want to throw down on it and then they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll give you money but i haven&#x27;t i haven&#x27;t seen venture capital you know the big players that that are willing to take the risk and then tell their limited partners why i just blew 20 million dollars on you know anti-gravity you know what i mean like they&#x27;re always looking for an exit where&#x27;s their exit right oh yeah i mean if you&#x27;re investing in anti-gravity your exit&#x27;s going to be 30 decade or yeah a decade or two out at least you&#x27;re talking about starting a company that&#x27;s a size that&#x27;s going to need to be the size of toyota in order to be profitable right or bigger right yeah and have the cooperation of various governments and faa and god knows who else is going to sign off on the thing it&#x27;s a long you know it&#x27;s a long road but it&#x27;s worth pursuing in my opinion and it has the capability of changing the world absolutely so let me jump in real quick mark steele had a question too uh so mark mark so-called were you just about there or i&#x27;m done i&#x27;m done okay mark just to follow up with you what i want to do is read about your project and then i&#x27;ll answer your question about how i think my thoughts integrate with what you&#x27;re doing is it fair enough okay yeah i think um remy just posted a link to the paper in the chat so you can check that out awesome fantastic and then uh let me see mark let me ask you to unmute mark steele okay sure sure so um i put in the chat but i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll try to summarize it um you know i was curious you know steve mentioned the levels of secrecy and everything and i was a military officer so i&#x27;m familiar with the clearances and stuff like that in the structure um how do you think those apply to like the pays i&#x27;m not sure if i&#x27;m saying his name right salvatore pays patents uh via the navy that they filed because those all seem like pretty far out you know almost science fictiony kinds of things um i&#x27;ve got a good friend who&#x27;s got two graduate engineering degrees from mit and is a patent attorney for the doe including los alamos and oak ridge and all those types of labs and she&#x27;s pretty convinced that the navy would not file patents like that unless they had something either working or pretty close to working that they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to go public because she said basically filing a patent is the opposite of all those levels of secrecy correct right how they work it how they&#x27;ve always worked it and again i&#x27;m speaking up the early 1990s experience is that the u.s patent office when they get patents in if there&#x27;s something um of a and the uk does the same thing right you know they call it something else over there if there&#x27;s something that has implications for national security they before they you know while they&#x27;re processing it it takes a while to pass process patents you know provisionals or formal filings while they get the submission they run it by um the defense guys and they have tons of scientists really good ones and if it looks like it&#x27;s something that might be they don&#x27;t want the public you know to be published they&#x27;ll they&#x27;ll vector it off into a black patent program it&#x27;s all patents that are black and if they let it if they let it go public it could mean one of one of three things one that&#x27;s not something they think would work practically in other words you&#x27;re not warm so they&#x27;ll let it out the second one would be it&#x27;s let&#x27;s see something that&#x27;s might partially work but is far enough off where like their competitors and let&#x27;s call them in my day the soviets the russians of the chinese or whomever would would uh maybe spend money on waste money on right it might have some merit to it and the third possibility is that it actually slipped through the cracks you know what i mean the patent examiner was like it was a monday and didn&#x27;t catch it and it went through and nobody caught it in the system so that&#x27;s also you&#x27;re going to hang that one out there too if if it was one of the fourth option that it was actually intentional they&#x27;re putting it out there and it actually works because they uh yeah i mean she was just about to the public familiar with all those black patent things right i mean she like she she works with los alamos and oak ridge and all those places right she works with so um you know she seemed to think the patent office even with those kinds of patents is pretty adamant that if you can&#x27;t at least show them that there&#x27;s some chance this thing works they&#x27;re not going to they&#x27;re not going to grant you the patent right and and and you know so there&#x27;s at least something out there that you know i actually i just missed these patents initially i read them on like like this is a bs or it&#x27;s just a psyop or it&#x27;s just something thrown out there to muddy the waters or something and she i was surprised because she took a completely opposite view of that well there&#x27;s another concept that we used to use a lot in the black world which was um hips right hide in plain sight so one was like yeah that&#x27;s it we&#x27;re gonna put it out there and nobody makes a fuss about it it&#x27;s sitting right in plain sight and their opponents will look at it and say that would they would never let this out this is this is not like your space force base that you mentioned out remember where you said it was from but yeah it&#x27;s i maricopa show you the exact location but it&#x27;s still there i looked at you know from google earth and it was like all kinds of weird stuff happening on that property weird things that you know and they cut every every couple of years they come out with a local news article about what&#x27;s going on there and it never matches up with what i see in the from from from the from the sky so it&#x27;s pretty funny but you know almost certainly it&#x27;s an underground base of some sort um the official explanation now since all this happened is that it used they use it to monitor uh space activity or something you know it&#x27;s part of that network and that may be true i don&#x27;t know but i saw some other real funky things going on there at one time you know um makes sense i&#x27;m i&#x27;m actually i find all this con i find all this pretty fascinating but i&#x27;m uh and i&#x27;m an engineer but i uh i haven&#x27;t been this deep into the physics for a long time and so a lot of this is over my head but it&#x27;s a pretty fascinating pretty fascinating discussions you know a lot of this is over my head um i just relate what i see and known my thoughts and that&#x27;s about it what they&#x27;re worth yeah thank you steve and thank you as well mark um okay so let me see so let me see do we have a couple more questions we have just about five minutes left steve steve thank you so much for joining us today that was absolutely remarkable yeah and you especially for the q a too you&#x27;ve just really drilled through this um let me see eric hermansen had asked about he was talking about inertial shielding eric did you want to try to squeeze in a few thoughts uh hi tim no i know i kind of just uh blurting out some messages and chat um you know inertial shielding so uh there&#x27;s a guy named paul marmay uh and probably nobody&#x27;s read his papers because uh they&#x27;re in his estate and you have to go to his estate website see them and uh he theorized that the inertia is from the uh in inductance uh of a magnetic field while the charged particle is accelerating and it it uh if you read uh jackson electromagnetics book uh third edition chapter 11 and you look at the radiation reaction force um which is a you know an unknown uh you know a known phenomenon um uh if uh if you could somehow uh shield the back reaction so that you&#x27;re taking advantage of the runaway acceleration without uh with without the back reaction the feedback that comes from the back reaction uh then you could essentially have a an exponential runaway acceleration uh where you may not uh feel any inertia inertial effects um i don&#x27;t know how to you know i i think that uh that propellant propulsion and anti-gravity are things that are simpler than people think and i think there&#x27;s more than many more than one mechanism that works in terms of inertial shielding that&#x27;s i think that&#x27;s a tougher problem to solve and i&#x27;m not sure it can be done but uh it&#x27;s hard enough you know people talk about five dimensions 11 dimensions i think it&#x27;s hard enough to work in three dimensions and i think it&#x27;s hard enough to get propelled this propulsion to work so you know i say let&#x27;s let&#x27;s tone it down a notch and let&#x27;s just get something to work now to think about all this other stuff amy i agree with you what you just said about there&#x27;s more than one way to skim this cat i totally think that&#x27;s the case i also think that although i was very interested in that inertia thing and how how paul air was saying that the step one the baby step is to get the propulsion thing working right i just thought ahead to that one because i&#x27;m not working on the propulsion side anymore how would i tackle that so i came up with this sort of mental ideas about it but i did think that if you could achieve that level of sophistication you might solve more than one problem more than just the inertial canceling it might be you&#x27;re solving a couple of problems at once i don&#x27;t know i i think it&#x27;s possible to create uh it probably is possible to create force fields uh that are impenetrable that aren&#x27;t based on a black hole or white hole uh creation i know jack sarfati has this pretty cool idea where you can create a white hole where things can get out but nothing can get in i&#x27;m not so sure you need to do that i think there&#x27;s there&#x27;s other ways to do that um so you might be able to create a force field shield um if you really look hard on the internet you&#x27;ll find some examples of uh things that have occurred in manufacturing plants where uh you know um and and one of them was written up in a um electrostatics journal where uh you know it&#x27;s it seemed to people to the scientists working in the plant that uh there was some kind of a force field being produced through the motion of electrostatic charges so you know i think a lot of things are possible it&#x27;s just a matter of figuring them out and testing them and making sure the government doesn&#x27;t classify everything so that we could at least you know you know because that would be a great uh asteroid shield right uh if we get that to work so um who knows to answer your question actually the gentleman before was asking what i see in the future i think looking at this field now and i&#x27;ve only been looking at it for the last i don&#x27;t know six years or whatever i didn&#x27;t even know it was a field before that but looking at all the data and knowing the military as i do and knowing the black world i think they&#x27;re getting pretty close to like letting chunks of this out to the public to use for the like the the common good right i always think about that you know the pushback on that is always non-proliferation right same with the stuff it&#x27;s like their obsession which is the right to be obsessed it&#x27;s a lot of well lunatics there are and and there&#x27;s two problems that i see if it&#x27;s possible to easily create antimatter or have some kind of nuclear reaction where you get protons or positrons flying out that&#x27;s very dangerous right you could blow up the city block with uh a teaspoon full of antimatter i think i don&#x27;t know i&#x27;ve never calculated it then the other no no you can blow up more than that with that matter it&#x27;s absolutely you know incredible if you get enough of it yeah yeah we can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t let that kind of thing up and then there&#x27;s the kinetic energy uh weapons right so anything that&#x27;s over a mach 5 weapon it&#x27;s hard to stop that and and right so i mean a a vehicle so if you have a mach 5 or higher vehicle you could deliver like a nuclear weapon but that&#x27;s actually bad especially if it&#x27;s a thermal nuclear weapon but it may not be as bad as is being able to attain like a mach 30 and smashing a much smaller uh heavy object right yeah um you know what one half mv squared so uh the v is is is to the square and you you could destroy a city block maybe with uh a softball going at uh mach 30. i don&#x27;t know but but you get what i&#x27;m saying right i do so that&#x27;s the problem is the kinetic energy you know we don&#x27;t really want people to be able to uh launch things that can fly extremely fast even if they take a long time to accelerate uh you don&#x27;t want that and you don&#x27;t want at least you don&#x27;t want that until there&#x27;s peace in the world and you also don&#x27;t want and that&#x27;s why i created the peace to final frontier uh peace initiative on facebook but you also don&#x27;t want um people to be able to de-orbit satellites or especially like the space station right because that thing&#x27;s going at what 22 000 miles an hour and it&#x27;s damn heavy and big and if it survives reentry that could you know that that could tear down a a row of skyscrapers pretty easily right oh yeah kinetic kinetic weapons from space they&#x27;re a real real problem big problems yeah so those are the things you got to classify but like we don&#x27;t really need to have airplane crashes anymore why you know why have families suffer uh you know when their loved ones die in an airplane crash when maybe there&#x27;s a better way to do it and you know i gave this a lot of thought looking at this whole thing and seeing you know for example just the just the electromagnetic you know or gravitation stuff that i was working on think about it um can i do i have time for a quick story well no no actually um we&#x27;re steve we&#x27;re we&#x27;re out of time because okay actually i&#x27;m a minute later yeah so so let let me do this yeah if you&#x27;ll be here for the q a session later and if not we could do it another time but um so let me go back to gal review real quick and and let me see meet everybody out so everyone please again put your hands together and give steve lutz an enormous thank you for his time and very long detailed q a session um and again thank you again steve we&#x27;re yeah we&#x27;re just squeezing up on our time</p>
