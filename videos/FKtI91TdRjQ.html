            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>on July 26 there was a historic Congressional hearing on UFOs three so-called Witnesses two of them actually never saw a UFO testified to Congressional leaders about UFOs and aliens we previously released a breakdown of red flags inaccuracies and outstanding questions from this hearing a link to this video is in the description below the star witness of the hearing was David grush who claims alien UFOs have crashed on earth and the government is in possession of both the alien craft and the alien bodies in this video we&#x27;ll discuss the dubious characters connected to grush and how they played a role in pushing UFOs all the way to Congress another red flag even before the hearing started Mick was the presence and involvement of George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell who sat front and center at the hearing walked into the hearing like rock stars uh you know in my our reporting at the post we&#x27;ve you know gone into a lot of the claims of George Knapp you know who is deeply deeply deeply invested in Skinwalker Ranch and the stories of Bigfoot and the stories of God knows what with no evidence ever presented who admits there&#x27;s no evidence is there any evidence well not really but despite that writes books about it claiming it&#x27;s true and these two folks you&#x27;ve got Jeremy corbella former yoga instructor turned apparently military expert who&#x27;s an expert on all of this all of a sudden um and you know we learned that they met gresh you know a long time ago Dave grush approached us first added Like a Star Trek convention or something we we actually we actually did need to start a convention uh he came to the event he heard our presentation we spent some time together to talk about topics of mutual interest and then they met up at a UFO conference and there&#x27;s a photo of grush he&#x27;s sitting at a table with George Knapp with Jay Stratton with Travis Taylor those three deeply involved with skin walker Ranch deeply involved with dubious claims of just the craziest stuff ever have never presented any evidence um they&#x27;re sitting right behind grush and then Burchette thanks them I want to thank everybody for making this happen today I know I saw it in the crowd there George Knapp my buddy Jeremy Corbell what were your thoughts on that hole that&#x27;s ridiculous that was ridiculous uh and that was a big red flag as soon as I saw like the the witnesses lined up uh you you had uh Graves uh gresh and fraver and right behind on either side of of grush very very visible with George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell who as you know of this very dubious history of of inaccurate reporting of UFOs uh and a great example of that was this recent case from 29 Palms which was a video that was released by Jeremy Corbell and and George Knapp they said that there was this giant strangular craft the size of a football field that was that hovering over this Camp uh for for a long period of time that went everywhere that story went everywhere all over the news as this triangle UFO this spooky ship this craft for weeks mystery in the sky do you see the five dots there on your screen looks like a triangle seeming to hover over a base out of 29 Palms a triangular formation of light could this really be a mass UFO sighting joining us now is Jeremy Corbell and Jeremy Corbell himself joins us right now it&#x27;s Jeremy Corbell thank you so much for coming in thanks for having me uh and then it was almost immediately proven to be flowers what it actually was was what a lot of people pointed out within minutes of the the video being released was flares a very common uh source of UFO sightings on Military flares because they often drop them in in patterns and they&#x27;re quite large in the sky they&#x27;re spacing and they they descend fairly slowly and stay there for a while so we proved like 100 exactly what these were these these flares it really wasn&#x27;t that hard to figure it out you know Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp they they were the people responsible for leaking the green triangle video uh called it yeah and good nap Corbell their report they&#x27;re reporting it was flying pyramids yeah they were they said these these green triangles were actually triangular shaped and they were actually like a bunch of things La based investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell recently released this video taken by the Navy showing what he describes as pyramid-shaped UFOs UFOs are real they represent an advanced and sophisticated technology and then you of course proved without a doubt that the triangle shapes we see are actually due to the Triangular shape of the camera&#x27;s aperture basically with a triangular aperture anything that&#x27;s out of focus would look like a triangle you also proved without a doubt that most of the objects in the videos and photos were actually just Stars out of focus stars but despite all of this Corbell still claims still claims these were triangles pyramids you know he he tweeted like when I explained what it was it&#x27;s you know the aperture of the Triangular aperture of the camera I explained what it was and he basically tweeted saying basically it&#x27;s complete nonsense it&#x27;s a lie it&#x27;s a disinformation the Triangular aperture theory is just a big distraction from the reality of things when in fact it was all 100 accurate that&#x27;s what actually happened and as was confirmed by the Pentagon the Triangular appearance is a result of light passing through the night vision goggles and then being recorded by an SLR camera it is simply that that light source resolves itself through the um through the night vision goggles onto the SLR camera as a triangle but even that that&#x27;s an interesting thing the Pentagon confirmed you know the theory that iron various other people came up with because it was so obvious but the Pentagon said they didn&#x27;t figure it out for two years and what&#x27;s going on there uh who was actually looking into it oh it&#x27;s the UAP Task Force at that time which would have been Jay Stratton and Travis Taylor they couldn&#x27;t figure it out for two years this simple little Optical thing Travis Taylor PhD and Optics couldn&#x27;t figure it out what&#x27;s going on these are Ancient Aliens Stars these are you know authors of books about ghosts and and werewolves these are people who have been Hawking the UFO in Ghost and paranormal story for decades who make a living off of this their life depends on everything being spooky and they&#x27;re not only in attendance but we hear from congressional leaders they&#x27;re part of the process they&#x27;re influencing the leaders they&#x27;re submitting statements George Knapp my buddy Jeremy Corbell I&#x27;ve they&#x27;re not Witnesses but they&#x27;ve provided some statements on this subject and I see unanimous consent to enter those statements into the record Mr chairman without objection which is just baffling to me because Jeremy corbella has done nothing other than promote a narrative and release a whole bunch of really terrible UFO videos they get almost immediately debunked uh he&#x27;s a very good talker he he&#x27;s is quite compelling if you you don&#x27;t know the facts behind the case but somehow he&#x27;s managed to have this influence over people in Congress after the UFO hearing ended news Nation reported that Congressman Burchette originally had more than just three Witnesses lined up to testify on August 6th Jeremy Corbell claimed that there were five congressional UFO Witnesses and that all five were in attendance at the hearing so who according to corbel were the other two Congressional Witnesses George Knapp and himself</p>
