            <p>this whole idea where if you&#x27;re not looking at it you get one result but if you look at it you get another result the observer effect people over interpreted that as though your Consciousness is affecting the experiment here&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on the light is coming from the bulb reflecting off of you entering my retina going to my brain that&#x27;s how I can see you&#x27;re there let&#x27;s say you were smaller same effect let&#x27;s keep making you smaller and smaller and smaller there is a size below which when I turn on that light you will absorb that light and jump to another state of existence how do I know you&#x27;re here I turn on the lights but if you&#x27;re an electron I don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;re there I can&#x27;t see you let me turn on the lights I turn on the lights the photon hits the electron the electron jumps to a different state I cannot know what the electron is doing unless I illuminate it and if I illuminate it it&#x27;s doing something different from what it was before I illuminated it has nothing to do with Consciousness it has to do with interacting with the object in order to make a measurement and that requires some way to illuminate it to know that it&#x27;s there</p>
