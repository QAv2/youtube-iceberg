            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this channel is all about educational uh matters and uh mostly educational matters that are fairly obscure and esoteric things that people don&#x27;t really know anything about um but that are important to me and I feel like they would be important to other people if they did know about them so I try to bring them to light mostly people who have spent their whole life working on something wrote up their magnum opus uh usually like a Theory of Everything something that&#x27;s all encompassing um and nobody&#x27;s ever read it and so I&#x27;m trying to a lot of these people are my heroes I&#x27;m trying to bring their work to light and to a certain extent to synthesize their work because I think once you get to The Theory of Everything stage all the theories of everything are ultimately the same they just come out kind of come out in different languages depending on your angle on it you know your different perspectives uh I guess maybe kind of like a hologram or something or at least an elephant in the old Indian parable uh okay now today we are looking at uh this is a 164th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson was a an engineer who wrote up his reciprocal system of theory which is a uh Theory of Everything a system of theory that allows us to take control of science where we can figure out the science for ourselves because he presents a simple logical and straightforward system uh system to plug in to any subject scientific or otherwise but you have to really kind of understand the system and how it works before you can do that now we are looking at his 1979 book called Nothing But motion and this book is mainly on physics but it reflects the basic uh idea behind Larson&#x27;s system which is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter not made out of energy but it is made out of motion uh this is uh Illustrated in the form of the Einstein&#x27;s equation equals m c squared e energy uh equals matter times the speed of light squared If energy can be converted into matter and vice versa that means that neither one of those things can possibly be the most fundamental thing in the universe and actually that the most fundamental thing is the c squared part the speed of light squared and so matter and energy are merely two different kinds of emotion as well as every other type of scientific phenomena you can think of acceleration force pressure electric charge magnetic flux um you know even a matter density acceleration um it&#x27;s capacitance and many many other um quantities are all forms of motion and what distinguishes Larson&#x27;s uh Theory from other people who have decided that the universe is also made out of motion is that Larson defined motion as the relationship between space and time this sets up a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time you can think of motion as a fraction with either space or time as the numerator and either time or space as the denominator and um so that that fraction gives you that kind of a reciprocal relationship all of those qualities quantities um energy matter acceleration so on can be expressed exclusively through time and space so you know in Larson&#x27;s system energy is time over space matter is time to the third power over space to the third power speed we know is space over time 10 miles per hour acceleration is space over time to the second power 9.88 meters per second squared um capacitance turns out to be um space to the third power over T which actually kind of disagrees with Larson&#x27;s own derivation of that but that was uh I would I would say corrected by Dr Bruce Perrette in the last uh 25 years or so um then um in addition to this reciprocal relationship between space and time it basically means that um uh what we have is that space and time both have their coordinate aspects they have they both have three or more Dimensions they both have their clock aspects which is a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but no direction and uh just like a clock it&#x27;s always going forward but it&#x27;s not going in any particular direction and so that&#x27;s clock time it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later and in the same way there is clock space things are always getting farther and farther and farther apart and that is seen in the Hubble telescope all of the distant galaxies are moving away from each other and then we also have the discrete unit postulate meaning that time and space only come in discrete units there is no um there is only there is a minimum unit of time and space there&#x27;s no continuity there they are they come in chunks those chunks are very small so it looks continuous but it isn&#x27;t they they look continuous but they&#x27;re not and if you have one unit of space in one unit of time one over one then you have the speed of light the speed of light is therefore the midpoint of the universe not the maximum speed that Einstein claims it is Einstein is missing entire half of the universe that Larson calls the cosmic sector this is where all the motion is faster than the speed of light and in the material sector that is where that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the sector we&#x27;re familiar with where everything is slower than the speed of light so that makes sense if you have a universe of motion you have a back or what you have as the origin of that universe is already motion you have motion before you have anything uh moving you have motion and that is what Larson calls the progression of the natural reference system outward motion at the speed of light in all directions and then he takes his measurements from that datum that zero point for so the zero point for Larson where he takes measurements from is the speed of light outward in all directions are we going faster than that or slower than that if you&#x27;re going you know faster than that we&#x27;re talking about Cosmic sector and we&#x27;re talking about time over space relationships and if we&#x27;re in the material sector we&#x27;re talking about space over time relationships less than the speed of light and um so he kind of plugs that in and uh so we&#x27;re in chapter eight here of the um book nothing but motion and uh he was talking about how he was critiquing Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity and how it you know the theory of relativity gives you the right answers because it is mathematically correct but that the theory is not conceptually correct it gives you the right answers but it does not tell you why it gives you those right answers it just tells you to shut up and plug in the equation and don&#x27;t ask any more questions and he presents quotes from Einstein where he&#x27;s saying just that he&#x27;s saying you know just plug it in and don&#x27;t worry about what it actually means um and in some cases like Vernon Heisenberg Heisenberg says that they it actually doesn&#x27;t mean anything you know not only do you not have to worry about what it means but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything so uh Larson we&#x27;re going to take over for Larson talk here about um that uh that lack of scientific rigor in the theory of relativity okay uh taking over here in chapter eight of course this lack of a conceptual background is a general characteristic of the basic theories of present-day physics the free inventions of the human mind as Einstein described them and the theory of mass increase Is Not Unusual in this respect but the arbitrary character of the theory contrasts sharply with the full explanation provided by the reciprocal system this new system of theory produces simple and logical answers for all questions similar to those enumerated above that arise in connection with the explanation that it supplies furthermore one of these is in any respect ad hoc all are derived entirely by Ed by deduction from the assumptions as to the nature of space and time that constitute the basic premises of the new theoretical system both reciprocal system and Einstein&#x27;s theory recognize that their uh is a limit of some kind at unit speed Einstein says that this is a limit on the magnitude of the speed because on the basis of his theory the mass reaches Infinity at unit speed and it is impossible to accelerate an infinite Mass the reciprocal system on the other hand says that the limit is on the capability of the process a speed in excess of unity cannot be produced by electromagnetic means this does not preclude acceleration to higher speeds by other processes such as the sudden release of large quantities of energy in explosive events and according to this new theoretical Viewpoint there is no definite limit to speed magnitudes indeed the general reciprocal relation between space and time requires that speeds in excess of unity be just as plentiful and cover just as wide a range in the universe as a whole as speeds less than Unity the apparent predominance of low speed phenomena is re is merely a result of observing the universe from a location Far Over on the low speed side of the neutral axis okay so what he&#x27;s uh this this comes into play in a major way once we start talking about astronomy uh he he says that basically uh the speed of light can be crossed uh quite easily by a star or by a Galaxy when they explode so when they explode that creates faster than the speed of light speed and um he&#x27;ll get into that when we look at his book on astronomy that&#x27;s called a universe of motion and also in his uh 1971 book that&#x27;s called quasars and pulsars I think that Universe of motion book is from 1984. okay uh back to Larson one of the reasons why Einstein&#x27;s assertion as to the existence of limiting speed was so readily accepted is an alleged absence of any obser observational evidence of speeds in excess of that of light our new theoretical development indicates however that there is actually no lack of evidence the difficulty is that the scientific Community currently holds a mistaken belief as to the nature of the change of position that is produced by such emotion we observe that emotion at a speed less than that of light causes a change of location in space the rate of change varying with the speed or velocity if the motion is other than linear it is currently taken for granted that a speed in excess of that of light would result in a still greater rate of change of spatial location and the absence of any clearly authenticated evidence of such higher rates of location change is interpreted as proof of the existence of a speed limitation but in a universe of motion an increment of speed above Unity above the speed of light does not cause a change of location in space in such a universe there is a complete symmetry between space and time and since unit speed is the neutral level the excess speed above Unity causes a change of location in three-dimensional time rather than in three-dimensional space so that is the key there the um chapter itself is called Motion in time that uh gives you the idea um if you understand the reciprocal system that he&#x27;s talking about speeds in excess of that of the speed of light because if you have uh the speed of light as the midpoint and you have the material sector over here you have the cosmic sector over here you the way that you relate the two is basically by inverting you invert the roles of space and time so over here all the motion is in space but over here all of the motion is in time and they both have their coordinate aspects they both have three or more dimensions and so um we don&#x27;t really know how to recognize uh motion faster than the speed of light the scientists the Legacy scientists are basically saying it doesn&#x27;t exist there is no motion faster than the speed of light Larson is basically saying that yes there is motion faster than the speed of light but you don&#x27;t know how to look for it and so you&#x27;re not finding it you have to look in terms of of motion in time not Motion in space and so he&#x27;s going to kind of inform us how what that looks like okay back to Larson from this it can be seen that the search for tachyons hypothetical particles that move with a spatial velocity greater than Unity will continue to be fruitless speeds above Unity cannot be detected by measurements if the rate of change of coordinate positions uh is in space we can detect them only by means of a direct speed measurement or by some collateral effects there are many observable effects of the required nature but their status as evidence of speeds greater than that of light is denied because present day physicist on the ground by present-day physicists on the ground that it conflicts with Einstein&#x27;s assumption of an increase in Mass at high speeds in other words the observations are required to conform to the theory rather than requiring the theory to meet the standard test of science Conformity with observation and measurement so once again he&#x27;s exposing the theory of relativity and really 20th century science in general as being utterly unscientific and pretty much just bowing down to Einstein and saying hey if you make an assumption then we follow that in spite of the fact that we have actual evidence that uh you know debunks uh your assumption okay back to Larson the current treatment of the abnormal redshifts of the quasars is a glaring example of this unscientific Distortion of the observations to fit the theory we have adequate grounds to conclude that these are Doppler shifts and are due to the speeds at which these objects are receding from the earth until very recently there was no problem in this connection there was General agreement as to the nature of the redshifts and as to the existence of a linear relation between the redshift and the speed this happy State of Affairs was ended when quasars were found with redshifts exceeding one on the basis of the previously accepted Theory a 1.00 redshift indicates a recession speed equal to the speed of light the newly discovered redshifts in the range above 1.00 therefore constitute a direct measurement of Quasar motions at speeds greater than that of light but the present day scientific Community is unwilling to challenge Einstein even on the basis of direct evidence so the mathematics of the special theory of relativity have been invoked as a means of saving the speed limitation no consideration seems to have been given to the fact that this situation to which the mathematical relations of the special Rel of special relativity apply does not exist in the case of the Doppler shift as brought out in chapter 7 and as Einstein has explained very clearly in his works the lorentz equations which express those mathematics are designed to reconcile the results of direct measurements of speed as in the mickelson-morley experiment with the measured changes of coordinate position in a spatial reference system as everyone including Einstein has recognized it is the Direct speed measurement that arrives at the correct numerical magnitude indeed Einstein postulated the validity of the speed measurement as a basic principle of nature like the result of the mickelson-morley experiment the Doppler shift is a direct measurement simply a counting operation and it is not in any way connected with a measurement of spatial coordinates thus there is no excuse for applying the relativity mathematics to the redshift measurements in as much as the time dilation aspect of the lorentz equations is being applied to some other phenomena that do not seem to have any connection with spatial coordinates it may be desirable to anticipate the subject subsequent development of theory to the extent of stating that the discussion in chapter 15 will show that those dilation phenomena that appear to involve time only such as the extended lifetime of fast-moving unstable particles are in fact consequences of the variation of the relation between coordinate spatial location and absolute spatial location uh meaning location in the natural moving system with the speed of the objects occupying these locations the Doppler effect on the other hand is independent of the spatial reference system okay we&#x27;re going to leave it there take over tomorrow thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
