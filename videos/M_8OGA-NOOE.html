            <p>hello viers it&#x27;s a beautiful Saturday morning and I&#x27;m going to show you today my turbine how how is it working yeah and the setup in the garage what is connected to the electrical grid the inverter and everything else yeah we can see that turbine is spinning but uh the wind is like almost maybe one or 2 m/ second it&#x27;s actually not usable BT uh speed but you will see if I turn the camera you will see that yeah the leaves are are moving yeah on the trees and also the the generator is spinning we will now see uh what&#x27;s what is the speed uh what is the voltage we are getting at this maybe 1 and a half m/ second I will turn on the light okay uh so this is the complete system you will see right now all what we need the B inverter the the the the voltage meter and the system for the breaking of the turbine if the wind is too high and you will see now yeah you saw the wind outside we are getting somewhere like 12 four or 13 volts maybe yeah something like that I don&#x27;t have a focus I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s up to 15 volts yeah unfortunately if we look here we are getting fault because inverter is 24 volts 24 to 60 volts yeah you can see now the model you can Google it on eBay it&#x27;s a grid tie uh power inverter and you can connect it directly to the electrical grid and it synchronizes the voltage yeah um the input voltage is uh 24 yeah 60 volt yeah uh in this range you you will get the over here it will show up the green when it&#x27;s loading now it&#x27;s fault because um above 12 volts it show it shows the fault and when it comes to the 20 4 volts or 22 volts yeah you will uh you will get the green the loading yeah okay now let&#x27;s get back here what do we have here uh so our generator is connected to this cable H it&#x27;s cable comes to the this connector yeah and then to the two position switch Yeah and why is that you you see the cables are coming uh down here and we can switch it we can switch it to the resistors yeah this is like alloy of the SE wire because this is like um thermal resistors you can um you can buy that it&#x27;s I think one kilowatt each each one and uh this is connected to this switch yeah so when the this the wind speed is too high what we do if we now uh put this switch down you will see that the voltage will drop yeah not significantly significantly but will if if the wind speed would be high and the current is actually produced then the uh we will you will see okay I will now turn it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like 12 volts and if I turn it on the voltage will drop and the turbine will decrease in speed yeah now the the uh the switch is down and the voltage has dropped yeah if I return it back now you&#x27;ll see that the voltage will increase slowly because the speed is of the Vintage really slow yeah and um this is it yeah this is it so if you want to if the wind is too high in speed you just connect instead of inverter you connect the resistors and the current will be dissipated in the resistors okay in this um between it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the funny I took this uh plate if this is like um AAS potion it means a fire hazard yeah but we actually do not have a fire here but it could happen yeah if we do something wrong and this is like the diodes yeah this is like the diodes for each phase it&#x27;s connected the wires yeah and then we have two wires uh to the inverter yeah from the output of the diode Bridge it goes two wires to the plus minus of the inverter and when the voltage is enough we produce the current uh and it is transmitted to the electrical grid yeah it&#x27;s synchronized and this is the complete system it&#x27;s really easy uh this is like some capacitors my father has exp did some um I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know what he did with that but he thought that it would stab stabilize the voltage but it doesn&#x27;t yeah it should be a electronic circuit for for doing that but the this is the complete setup yeah we have another another uh switch over here this is for when I buy the panel solar panels and then I will also have this switch to disconnect it and I do not want to produce the power yeah and this is it this is this is so much easy that it hurts yeah we have U we have uh the let&#x27;s say very simple system which can produce the the the power yeah I can show you the other stuff here in the room yeah you will see uh here this is this over here this was some some small G for testing of this kind of wings you before we did the big one just to see how it spins this one actually spins really fast because um yeah when you have the bigger diameter yeah you will get the slower rotation speed yeah and if you have the lower diameter of the Wings you will get the bigger speed yeah but lower power yeah the wings are very important if not the most important part and then we have here another if you see this is the support this is like I think this is one is little bit bigger than the one now installed on the turbine it&#x27;s like a spare one we can do another another set another generator with it yeah don&#x27;t have to buy new steel for that okay we can see now that uh the system is really simple we have only six diodes we have some so one switch and the power inverter yeah and this is all connected to the electrical grid which is the power is synchronized and I must not say that but I can say it it Returns the the your electrical meter it will turn backwards if you have the analog one if you have a digital one it will not unfortunately yeah and this is it yeah this is the this is my system I I I I like I I like what we did here yeah it works yeah it produces the power you can see that the generator is spinning almost all the time yeah no matter how low the speed is but it will not produce in the usable voltage it will spin yeah and it&#x27;s you can hear yeah you can not hear nothing yeah this is why this is so good because the the the no the noise in the vert vertical turbines are really really small or even none yeah the noise is none I never heard it yeah this this sound from the generator of of spinning yeah and this is it yeah so thank you guys for for watching yeah I think I explained and showed you what you wanted to see that it&#x27;s not just the project which is on the paper it&#x27;s actually a working system which produces the power yeah and I cannot tell you in in which time it will payoff maybe in a few years but as I said in my previous video the the purpose of this is really to actually to learn something to see how this how the electric current is produced in the real life yeah with the wires magnets and and the physical part of the project yeah okay thank you very much bye-bye</p>
