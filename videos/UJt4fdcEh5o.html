            <p>what is a bi Vector when you&#x27;re thinking of vectors as oriented line segments bi vectors are commonly described as oriented plane segments however people often get confused when they&#x27;re told that any two plane segments with the same orientation and magnitude are equal even if they have a different shape so what actually is a b Vector personally I think it&#x27;s best to think of by vectors as an entire plane with an orientation and a magnitude then a particular plane segment is just one of many representations of the bifactor in general you can think of objects in geometric algebra as representing subspaces with an orientation and a magnitude</p>
