            <p>can I jump in here Hal um because you know L Lou alzando has of course stated many times publicly that the a tip program has many videos that are even Superior far superior to the gimbal for instance which is probably the best of the three we&#x27;ve seen so far and I&#x27;m just I&#x27;d like to know like when you were you were very closely involved with the ATP program did you were you able to see any of these highly you know that these better videos and do you believe that there are some still from that program that should be or could be released the answer is yes uh I visited L Alando there uh in the Pentagon and uh as part of the a tip program Advanced Aerospace threat identification program and got to see videos uh some of them and and of course under really conditions one of the reasons that many of these videos have not been released is because of the location of where they were taken and under what circumstances and in what battle situations they were taken and so on and uh they&#x27;re of unbelievably high quality so I hope that uh some of these will come out in the future and I think they probably will as time goes on but anyway yes the answer is yes there are additional videos that would be I believe pretty persuasive to anybody who who got to see them taken under extraordinary conditions by official uh government uh operations so isn&#x27;t there any way they could release even part of those or somehow redact I don&#x27;t know how well you can redact on video but somehow remove the sensitive parts and just let people see the actual craft that&#x27;s in the videos I think there I can&#x27;t think of any reason why that would not be the case and uh I anticipate that as time goes on eventually uh that will be the case</p>
