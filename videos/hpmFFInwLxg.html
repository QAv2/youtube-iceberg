            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>the Steven Greer Steven Greer documentary about the last century the last century yeah the invention secrecy act of 1951 so le let&#x27;s go through that do you mind just taking a moment and share you have certain number of patents I don&#x27;t know what the number is say 30 30 something patents no it&#x27;s right now we have over hey this your boy Dave now Terence Howard was recently on PBD a podcast talking about actually the article or the headline that got me was they stole my patches now I I watched interview and I didn&#x27;t hear anything of him saying that they stole my patents of verbatim. But the interesting uh the interview is nonetheless interesting. I&#x27;m going to start to hear where they&#x27;re kind of talking about patents and we&#x27;re going to pull some stuff out uh pull some stuff up which uh hey the chat GBT we&#x27;re going to pull up the USPTO database which is United States Patent Trademark Office. We&#x27;re going to pull up uh kind of look up on Google and I want to get your guys&#x27; feedback, your guys&#x27; comments. Please comment in the uh in the comment section below on do you think maybe kind of Google or the USPTO is has taken Terren Howard&#x27;s patent has uh you know maybe suppressed his kind of inventiveness or kind of what he has done.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to give you kind of my take on why I think that may be the case. I would love to hear you guys&#x27; feedback in the comments section. Some housekeeping items. Please hit the like button for the YouTube algorithm as well as hit the subscribe button to be a part of the IP community. I&#x27;m a 10 year intellectual property attorney dealing with patents, trademarks, copyrights.</p>
<p>So, when I saw this, they stole my patents. I said, &quot;This is going to be uh uh something great that I can break down and kind of bring to the audience and hopefully provide some value to you guys.&quot; So, they&#x27;re essentially picking up right now on Steve Greer, which PBD has on had on. And Steve Gri a big alien proponent or you know person who talks a lot about aliens as well as the government taking people taking people inventions which they can do via the uh what the the the invention secrecy act that I think uh PBD had kind of spoke about where to the extent that they think it&#x27;s kind of national security or or something along uh defense or something like that they can uh you know more or less take your invention stop you from maybe using it stop you from putting it out there and there&#x27;s some crazy stuff that&#x27;s going to go on in this interview that I would love to get your guys&#x27; feedback on But this is the first thing we&#x27;re going to talk about where Terence Howard is kind of talking about the number of patents he has and and I&#x27;m going to pull up some stuff that may uh like I said l to why the government and the USPTO Google you know that may be suppressing this information or taking this uh taking this patent. So let&#x27;s go and uh again hit that like button and uh don&#x27;t don&#x27;t I would love to hear you guys copies in the comment section. Let&#x27;s go.</p>
<p>90 something separate patents. Um, we have 30 different trademarks and copyrights, but most of the stuff are are hard patents. And and the patents, are they all in the states or all in the states? Well, I&#x27;ve got them worldwide. You have to you started filing them here, but a lot of them are redundant patents in other countries. What is this, Ram? That So, so let&#x27;s check this out.</p>
<p>So, number one, I would I would say that uh you don&#x27;t necessarily have to file here in the US. You can kind of file a you can file in whatever country you want to first and then go into other countries. So if you want to file in Germany, you can file in Germany. If you want to file in China, you can file in China. If you want to file in Japan or another country, you can do that and then maybe file in the US kind of later on.</p>
<p>But typically, at least for US inventors, they file first here in the US and then they may be filed in other countries as well. you&#x27;ll file a PCT application which I think he was hitting that in terms of worldwide patent application and then you can just national phase that application in different countries that you want you you&#x27;re seeking patent protection is so he is right in a sense it&#x27;s kind of you know the the wording is a little bit may uh maybe not as accurate in terms of redundant patents you know you filing a what is called typically I&#x27;m assuming he&#x27;s talking about a PCT application uh which is a single application and then as opposed to having to file multiple separate application in each country you can just take that PCT application and apply buy it in these different countries that you want to go into. But this is the thing that&#x27;s interesting. I&#x27;m actually kind of blow my screen up because I definitely want to kind of have you guys see this cuz I think this is a no this is this is interesting. So this is on chat GPT.</p>
<p>This is on chat GPT. This says Terence Howard known for his acting career has been active as an inventor. According to a 2025 analysis, he has filed 94 patent applications. Look at this is from chat GPT. So again, I think that&#x27;s this is going to be the title of this uh of of this actual video.</p>
<p>Is is Chat GPT more accurate than Google? Is it more accurate than the United States Patent Trademark Office? I&#x27;m going to show you why here in a little bit, but it says he has filed according in 2025 the analysis. This is chat GPT saying this, he has filed 94 patent applications with 60 granted. So that means he has filed 94 of them. I know he was on Joe Rogan and I had did some breakdown interviews and I&#x27;m like, &quot;Hold on, man. pulling some stuff up and I&#x27;m kind of looking at the USB website.</p>
<p>I think it was on uh virtual reality, real reality and kind of merging the two and like hold on, he did have a and it seems like some of these patents was not granted and it seemed like that maybe kind of virtual reality, real reality uh merging was maybe one of the ones that wasn&#x27;t uh wasn&#x27;t granted but again according to chat GPT it said he has 60 patents granted. In other words, saying that 60 patents were awarded to him. Over 80% of these patents are active. So that means they&#x27;re active. His innovation span various fields including augmented reality.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s the one he was kind of talking about on Joe Rogan that I did a breakdown of the AR virtual reality. Apparently he has some stuff in jewelry design and uh modular construction system. So that&#x27;s interesting. I&#x27;mma play it a little bit more and then I&#x27;mma uh kind of stop and I&#x27;mma bring up some stuff that kind of contradicts what chat GP again. This is chat GPT and this is what chat GPT is saying.</p>
<p>I&#x27;mma play it a little bit and then I&#x27;mma pull some stuff up that is saying how uh or that contradicts what chat GPT is saying. Let&#x27;s go. That&#x27;s just how many uh according to chat GPT. Okay. According 94 patents with 60 go.</p>
<p>Okay. Perfect. So you got 94 patents. So look it 94 patents 60 is granted. So let me uh kind of stop this for a second.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to pull up some I&#x27;mma pull up the United States patent trademark database. This is where all the This is where all the patents are housed. So, if you kind of go to the USPTO and you can kind of search by a number of factors. What I just did was I searched by the inventor name Terrence. Well, I put in his his middle name, Desan.</p>
<p>But they only came up with three patents. This one was from 2011, 2011, and 2010. So, these are three or at least patent applications. They don&#x27;t even have them as granted. Uh it&#x27;s just an application.</p>
<p>So, these are only three. Now obviously he may have some in uh he may have some in a company name but again when you file a patent application you still have to give the inventor. So even if he was to have something for example I can search by the applicant. The applicant is for example uh the applicant can be a LLC. It can be uh you know some some other company outside of the inventor.</p>
<p>But on all patent applications you still have to put the inventor on it. Even if the inventor doesn&#x27;t own the the patent or the patent application, you still have to put the inventor name on the patent application when you file it. So on all the inventions that were owned by Terrence Deshan, which is, you know, Terrence Desan pretty unique middle name going with Terrence, only three comes up. And you see here, this is the United States patented trademark database. USPTO.</p>
<p>This is their official an official website of the United States government. It&#x27;s only pulling up three, which we just saw in chat GBT. It pulled up said that he had 94 patents with six of them granted. I&#x27;m g show you guys one more thing before we get back to playing the rest of the article. Again, I want to hear from you guys because this was interesting as I uh kind of pulled it up and it&#x27;s like, okay, is the government in cahoots against Terren Howard? This is Google.</p>
<p>I just typed in actor Terren Howard patents. This Terrence Howard has filed patent applications including 14 assistant virtual and uh real reality, but no patents has been issued to him. This is something that I again this is on Google but as I said before we have just looked at the fact that at least according to chat GPT so it seems like people are getting their information from different databases Google is saying he&#x27;s filed many but he doesn&#x27;t have any the USPTO website has only have has have them down for three patents however or three patent applications I should say and chat GPT is saying he has over 94 filed applications and 60 granted patents which you guys should be asking hold on why the discrepancy between chat GPT and the United States penet trademark office in Google and that hence the invention secrecy act which the United States government can when you file an application they can essentially make it secret such that again if it&#x27;s dealing with defense or national security for example if it can disrupt the energy which I think they&#x27;re going to talk about the oil industry they can make that patent a secret and therefore it&#x27;s not searchable or ascertainable by kind of you and I or the general public So, I&#x27;m not it seems like chat GPT has some it has it can have some I&#x27;m not sure where it&#x27;s pulling this information, but it&#x27;s definitely contradicting what the United States Patent Trademark Office says. But again, if you have somebody telling you that they filed a number of applications, you only can search three of those applications. I I would guess that some of those applications have been made secret by the United States uh Patent Trademark Office or essentially the federal government.</p>
<p>uh because again it&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to have 94 filed applications and only three of them are in the US and the other 91 are in foreign countries. Matter of fact to the extent that you do have a uh if it&#x27;s a secret application which is just one of the things that I maybe don&#x27;t understand because if this deemed secret if you file in the US and the US government say hey we&#x27;re not going to let anybody see this because of national security because of defense typically you can&#x27;t file those in other countries. So that&#x27;s the interesting thing cuz he&#x27;s saying hey you have redundant patents you file first in the US and then you file in other countries which I agree that is kind of more or less the process of how it works but if your application is deemed secret here in the US until it&#x27;s no longer a secret or under that kind of secret of investigation you cannot file in other countries such as China such as Japan such as India such as uh say Germany for example so this where it gets a little bit interesting so let me kind of pull back up the rest of the actual this is one a little longer than I wanted to go this particular video but just kind of pull up the rest of the article in a video and uh kind of finishes out what uh Terrence has to say. Let&#x27;s go. What what what new findings, you know, what what have you found where the average person can benefit from and if you&#x27;re sitting there, you said this is worth in the trillions of dollars and you and I are speaking before you&#x27;re like if another country gets their hands on this, it&#x27;s an end of America.</p>
<p>What have you found? Well, we&#x27;ve been able to innovate. The first thing that everybody already knows about is the tangential flight. With Lynchpin, we have provided tangential flight, the ability to fly around your own center of mass and unlimited midair bonding. I mean, it&#x27;s the end of cranes for the lynch pin because no matter how large the project is or how small it is, lynch pins can modulate and cover over air, over land, over sea. You have flight vehicles that deal with, you know, that are able to deal with the air or deal with space or deal with or deal with the water.</p>
<p>You have cars for the land, but you don&#x27;t have anything that is ubiquitous to all of these mediums. And that&#x27;s what Lynchpin is able to do. So when I say it&#x27;s the end of cranes, it&#x27;s the So you have that. We&#x27;ve innovated flight. We&#x27;ve innovated geometry by having unlimited bonding.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve innovated lighting, you know, to we&#x27;ve innovated with um our energy systems. And what I wanted to share with you um one of the biggest things that I talked about with the Howard Kama, it&#x27;s ability to pull energy directly from the Vanderwalss or from the zero point. You know, we&#x27;ve already provided the a means to do that to where you don&#x27;t have to pay for any energy anymore. The same thing when I talked about burillium, utilizing burillium, even though there were some idiot um uh chemists that came out and said that what I said concerning burillium was wrong, but I dare them to compare burillium to or then that&#x27;s pretty much where we&#x27;re going to finish up, man. Hey, he gets deep.</p>
<p>And I must say, man, initially I called I don&#x27;t want to say called, but I thought maybe he was a little bit cuckoo, but let&#x27;s just say BBD actually had a NASA physicist on Dr. U, which I&#x27;m not going to play that part at least on this video. And I want to say he went toe-to-toe, but a lot of things that Terence Howard said, Dr. U, who&#x27;s been with NASA for over 17 years as a physicist, kind of, you know, not kind of, but agree with them. And it seems like kind of Terence Howard has is is is well read up on this particular topic.</p>
<p>So again, man, shouts out to Terence Howard. I think he&#x27;s got kind of going to be around for a while as it relates to the science. Obviously, he&#x27;s a little rough rough around the edges in terms of not having uh you know, the the the traditional schooling as it relates to kind of science and phys and physics and uh kind of math and things like that, but he&#x27;s definitely uh more or less selftaught, which again that&#x27;s not necessarily an issue here. So uh let me know what you guys think in the comments section. Do you think Terence Howard is kind of cuck cool or crazy, or do you think some of the stuff that he&#x27;s saying has merit to it? Definitely.</p>
<p>Like I said, one of the things, especially when we&#x27;re talking about patents, uh him talking about him having 94 patents and 60 of them granted, yet the USPTO and Google says otherwise. Why is that? That&#x27;s something that should have uh us asking questions as well. So, let me know your thoughts in the comments section. Hopefully, you guys enjoyed this particular video and I&#x27;ll be with you guys on the next one. Take care.</p>
