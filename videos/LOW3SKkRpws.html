            <p>all right everyone how are we doing today welcome to my channel my name is Thomas I do videos on many different subjects uh they are uh educational uh in nature and uh today is the 69th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson Mr Larson was born back in 1898 and up until the day he died in 1990 uh his whole most almost all of his adult life he spent uh working on refining the reciprocal system of theory which he laid out in his two uh initial postulates uh in the 1950s uh the general idea of his Theory of Everything Is that the universe is not made out of matter the universe is not made out of energy but the universe is made out of motion uh matter and energy are both forms of motion as is every other scientific phenomenon they&#x27;re all uh relationships between space and time motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are reciprocals of each other hence the reciprocal system of theory um that basically means that uh you have fractions you have relationships time over space or space over time but space and time both have um the same qualities and one of those qualities that we know of about space is that it&#x27;s multi-dimensional we say three-dimensional you can also say four-dimensional uh depending on whether you want to use uh cubic coordinates XYZ coordinates or tetrahedral coordinates but [Music] um that also means that time has three dimensions in the same way that space does time what we know about time is that time is progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later it&#x27;s flowing uh so that is also true about space space flows or space is always getting further and further apart and we can detect that the Hubble telescope detected that way back in the 1920s with the recession of the distant galaxies now uh space and time are also quantized meaning that there is a minimum unit of time there&#x27;s a minimum unit of space one unit there&#x27;s no less than one one unit of space in one unit of time space over time is speed one unit of space and one unit of time is the speed of light so unlike Einstein who says that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe in the universe of motion of Dewey Larson the speed of light is the midpoint or the neutral point of the universe and there is a half of the universe that actually moves faster than the speed of light as well as the half that we&#x27;re familiar with that moves slower than the speed of light the slower than speed of light side we call he calls the material sector or sector one and the faster than speed of light sector he calls the cosmic sector or sector two and they are divided by the speed of light boundary now when you cross the speed of light boundary um all you have to do is invert the relationships of space and time so in sector one we have basically space over time relationships but in sector two we have time over space relationships and over there in sector 2 time is three-dimensional with XYZ coordinates and space is progressing uh whereas in sector one space is got the three-dimensional coordinates and time is progressing that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re used to but over here it&#x27;s the relationships are inverted but uh through extrapolation we can figure out what&#x27;s going on in sector two now uh because it&#x27;s what it&#x27;s the same as what&#x27;s going on in sector one except that they are inverted now uh sector one grows by aggregation uh things uh cling on to each other and eventually um the uh atoms and molecules grow to their most complicated or complex form that being the DNA molecule which contains uh billions of atoms and at this point the DNA molecule becomes eligible to be taken over or controlled by a sector two unit um and that sector two unit when it even though it is a minor part of the overall structure of the combination it actually controls the controls the environment of sector uh sector one um uh body and that is what Larson calls the life unit life is a combination of sector one and sector two in the right uh components the right ratio and the right configuration and then life grows uh or develops and up to its most complicated complex form which Larson calls the intelligent human being or humanoid and at that point life becomes eligible to be taken over or controlled by a sector 3 unit now sector three is what Larson says is actually beyond space and time the metaphysical region um independent of space and time possibly you could think of it as the origin of space and time of the ancient uh Legends and and uh holy books called the god or the spiritual world Larson calls it sector three and sector three uh communicates with sector one through a transmission um mechanisms and those can be called uh variously intuition ESP scientific Insight religious Revelation they&#x27;re all the same Communications from sector three now what happens is that the human being uh or all life units are controlled by sector two and sector two uh is predicated uh predicates itself upon survival that is the goal of sector two but the goal of sector three is ethical Behavior and ethical or good behavior um and so there are times as Larson talked about last episode when sector one and or sector two and sector 3 work harmoniously and are governed by the same uh the same they have the same goals but there are also times where sector 2 and sector 3 work at Cross purposes and have to be uh decided the human being has to decide which one of those goals they&#x27;re going to pursue whether they&#x27;re going to pursue ethical Behavior or survival Behavior and that is the Crux of the Free Will problem and uh so we are looking at Larson&#x27;s final book here beyond space and time this is the book where he delves into metaphysics the philosophical the religious the psychological and uh we are in chapter 17 that is called free will so we&#x27;re going to resume right here uh in the middle of the chapter um he was uh recently he&#x27;s talking about causation and determinism and he was talking about how uh a lot of the modern physics quantum physics doesn&#x27;t really um have a real strong connection with either uh causation or um Free Will and that uh he was using the example of atomic um uh disintegration or uh Decay radioactive decay and that uh you know quantum physics can tell you statistically how many atoms are going to decay in a certain amount of time but they can&#x27;t tell you which atoms or why um and so uh he&#x27;s going to start right here in a similar manner we can often identify something that we call the cause of a physical event but this identification necessarily involves a somewhat arbitrary exclusion of items that have contributed to the causation furthermore the designated cause itself is uh the result of other causes on this basis the events at the atomic level to which modern physics is unable to assign any causes originate from the interaction of causal systems in the same manner as the familiar events of our everyday experiment experience the explanation which the reciprocal system supplies for the seemingly anomalous Atomic events is that physical objects can change their relative positions in time as well as in space and most of the events that occur at the atomic level are the results of changes of location in time either in addition to or in lieu of location changes in space the difficulty that has been experienced in applying the laws of classical physics to Atomic and subatomic events is due to the fact that these laws are governing Motion in space the changes of position and time that take place in these events are not governed by the laws of space motion but by other laws that are different from although related to the spatial laws now so remember uh in the sector one time is Flowing that&#x27;s the scalar motion of time it has a direction it has no Direction it just has a magnitude it&#x27;s either in or out it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not you know 30 degrees Northwest or something like that but in the sector two time is in coordinate time meaning it has x y z coordinates so time does have a direction uh and so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about uh when you&#x27;re talking about things at the atomic level um the motion in time is coordinate time and that&#x27;s not being accounted for by modern physics um they&#x27;re only accounting for motion in space motion and time is the reciprocal of the motion in space but the directions in time are not directions in space there are directions in time so um it&#x27;s hard to conceive of that but it it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s consistent throughout the way that Larson applies it okay the change of the position that uh in time that take place in these events are not governed by the laws of space motion but by other laws that are different from although related to the spatial laws when these Atomic events are viewed in their proper context they are not random and unpredictable as pictured by quantum theory they are just as regular and orderly as the macroscopic processes that follow the classical laws the same causal relationships that apply to ordinary everyday physical processes are therefore applicable to these Atomic events as well every event at the atomic or subatomic level is the result of the intersection of two or more causal systems determinism however is ruled out by another of the findings of the reciprocal system earlier physical theories considered the universe as being made up of things entities possessing a rather vague attribute known as substance the issue of determinism versus indeterminism was simply a question as to whether the laws governing the Motions of these things were definite and specific enough to enable accurate prediction of the later motions from a knowledge of the earlier ones but the development of the reciprocal system now shows that substance is motion of a particular kind and the things are there for nothing but motions furthermore there is a continual interchange between the things and other types of motion in many events particularly where the dimensions of motion are altered or where Motion in space and motion and time are interchanged the exact nature of the resultant is a matter of chance at these points causality is maintained as always but the deterministic chain is broken the contentions that an invariable sequence is essential to causality and the same cause must always have the same result are therefore erroneous in some classes of events determinism prevails and the exact nature of the result can be predicted if we have a full knowledge of the cause or causes but in other classes of events the actual result may be any one of a number of potential results determinism as a general phys uh physical principle is thus invalid denial of determinism is not however sufficient to establish the existence of free will the essence of Free Will is the choice but physical mechanisms have no choice as a result uh produce or a result produced by chance process is just as specific and definite as if it had been produced by a fully deterministic process Free Will exist only if the result that would have been produced by the normal physical processes chance or determine it as the case may be can be overruled at the option of that will and such a thing is totally foreign to the physical world both living and non-living physical units must follow the rules of their respective sectors sector 1 and sector two a mechanism has no will of its own free will is necessarily metaphysical that is non-physical that is sector three this is the inescapable fact that has driven the strict mechanist whether he&#x27;d be a scientist or philosopher into a denial of the reality of free will the concept of Free Will is a logical monstrosity a contradiction a fiction says uh some philosopher those that are inclined toward the mechanistic viewpoint but are unwilling to take a such a radical stand recognize that we are confronted with a dilemma this is one of man&#x27;s oldest riddles how can the independence of human volition be harmonized with the fact that we are integral parts of a universe which is subject to the rigid order of nature&#x27;s laws that was uh Max Planck most scientists would prefer to believe in the existence of free will but like Planck they see no way in which this Freedom can be reconciled with the physical laws to which man as well as well as the rest of the physical universe is subject they are not impressed by the arguments Advanced by those philosophers who Champion free will um and so then he&#x27;s gonna get into um some other uh philosophical positions quoting true bloody says the most powerful argument against determinism is that it utterly destroys any logical basis of responsibility and Larson says this is outright circularity the argument rests entirely on the assumption that man must be responsible for his actions but he cannot be held responsible unless he has freedom of action the premise on which this argument for the existence of Free Will is based is therefore equivalent to assuming freedom of the will other philosophy texts approach the responsibility issue in a different way contending that human recognition of a sense of personal responsibility is evidence of his uh of its existence uh and so then he goes into a little bit of a digression uh so the scientist has been left in an awkward position where that which he intuitively feels to be correct is in direct conflict with the information that he derives from The Logical by The Logical and factual methods of inquiry to which he and his profession are committed the question now arises is the conflict between the scientific and intuitive viewpoints actually as Iran reconcilable As It Seems there are those who would cut the guardian knot by repudiating some of the principles of science such as Berg&#x27;s son uh caused the law of conservation of energy a psychological mistake uh and proposes throwing it overboard to make room for free will but the conservation laws are just as firmly grounded in the reciprocal system as in um conventional science and the new information developed in the course of the present work therefore gives no support to such a suggestion the whole idea of sacrificing established physical principles as a means of avoiding conflicts is unscientific and all proposals of this nature will have to be rejected it would be feasible however for any agency capable of modifying the normal results of chance processes to overrule the purely physical response to a mental stimulus the mental mechanisms operating electrically operate electrically and the exact nature of the interactions between the individual electrical units the electrons and the atoms of matter is largely determined by chance a deliberate modification of these interaction patterns could conceivably make a major change in the ultimate result of a mental process such an intervention would conflict with what are called the laws of probability but as noted in the discussion of Miracles these probability laws are on a somewhat different footing than the physical laws in that they are based on a concept that is indefinable other than empirically all definitions of probability um of depend on the concept of equally likely events and no one has been able to specify what this means okay um we&#x27;re gonna stop there and uh resume the conversation or the reading uh tomorrow I hope you have a great day and hope to see you back tomorrow um signing off</p>
