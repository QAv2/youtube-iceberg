            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>good evening we&#x27;re happy to be here at the eighth international conference on future energy in albuquerque new mexico july 2016 and tonight we have a special guest who is a graduate of stanford university masters in communication who&#x27;s done documentary film television radio writing she&#x27;s had a regional emmys awarded to her and also a national emmy nomination and anna&#x27;s boston station peabody award she&#x27;s worked on various films honored films and her biography is so lengthy that i&#x27;m just highlighting some of the amazing accomplishments that she&#x27;s made lifetime achievement award in the conscious life expo she&#x27;s been on the history channels alien ancient aliens as well as i have and she&#x27;s been on lots more times than i have that&#x27;s for sure but she&#x27;s an authority and this is exciting to have her here today to tell you firsthand her research which is ongoing and unstoppable and i&#x27;m surprised that all the awards that she&#x27;s received very judiciously of course elect encyclopedia britannica award for journalistic excellence she also has the three-hour radio news reports that are on not only coast to coast but also the um is there a station that you you would recommend 500 stations throughout north america syndicated radio program and she&#x27;s also booked uh glimpses of other realities volume one and two i highly recommend those if you want to see her hands-on experience even with clop complex crop formation phenomenon and she&#x27;s participated as a journalistic witness even at the citizens hearing in 2013 which i was there as well and she was honored for the first lucious farish foundation award for excellence in research she&#x27;s traveled throughout the world pursuing her research and a featured speaker on a lot of different conferences and also a field investigator for the history channel which is also an honor in itself because they rely upon people like her for the stories that they actually broadcast as well as the discovery channel and her television productions have included the world of chemistry for the pbs channel earth mysteries ancient alien life forms and ufo reports sightings as well as work with the us unicef and international programming for earthbeat so speaking on the topic of the laminated metal specimen and with potential for electrogravidics please welcome linda [Applause] moltenhall thank you very very much thank you all very much for being here i want to thank tom balloon president of the integrity research institute in beltsville maryland for inviting me to share my research as an investigative reporter into the mystery of layered bismuth and magnesium with a little zinc in micron layers that to date since coast to coast art bell sent me a piece of the layered metal in 1996 to investigate no one at least no one that i am aware of has been able to understand the function or to replicate the strange layered metal that allegedly was retrieved from the bottom of a triangular wedge-shaped craft of unknown origin the site was described as west of the sierra blanca here&#x27;s the sierra blanca mountains here&#x27;s roswell here&#x27;s corona socorro here are the sierra blanca mountains here are the san mateo mountains specifically the first contact said that his grandfather was in a security team that was operating around this wedge-shaped vehicle retrieval and i think based on uh probably a dozen other whistleblowers it was up near the trinity site here&#x27;s trinity and here&#x27;s oscura the mountains actually run this way but this these words are so you can understand trinity side is the little red dot and here the oscura there&#x27;s north oscura peak and oscora peak they&#x27;re not too far apart but sometimes people quibble about whether this the actual crash was at the bottom of oscoro peak or north oscura peak along with the web-shaped craft there were two dead bodies and one live being and this is just to reinforce here is the north oscura peak and oscura peak here and the trinity site now before i go into those details i would like to share a little background about me i graduated in 1968 from stanford university with a master&#x27;s degree in communications where i produced a documentary film for the stanford medical center that they used for 19 years my master&#x27;s thesis documentary was about the first use of computers to analyze particle bombardments at the stanford linear accelerator in palo alto california then i worked as a tv producer writer director editor and reporter of documentaries and live studio productions for knbc in los angeles wcvb in boston where i was honored as a science and medical producer in a station peabody award and by 1978 i was hired as director of special projects at the cbs station in denver colorado then kmgh tv and why i&#x27;m stressing this is it seems schizophrenic to the general audience that anything having to do with an alien presence advanced technologies from another solar system or even another galaxy is preposterous and yet i&#x27;m standing in front of you here today after 37 years of trying to get to the bottom first of animal mutilations and where that took me with whistleblowers who were so frustrated by the fact that they&#x27;ve either had to sign non-disclosure agreements and why or not sign non-disclosure agreements and then really really hurt and it&#x27;s in the context of all of us in this very transitory revolutionary time where the united states of america is either going to honor the constitution and the government of by or for the people and the people like me who have been nothing but journalists trying to understand facts we have been hurt we continue to be and we continue to be restrained and i think that&#x27;s why i am so grateful that i&#x27;m here and i know that it is a scientific and an engineering context and so what i&#x27;m trying to communicate with a few words is that my beat has always been science environment and medicine until 1979 when i produced the 90-minute special of strange harvest about the worldwide bloodless trackless phenomenon of large and small animal mutilations it was sheriffs and deputies who told me then in 1979 quote to my face the perpetrators of animal mutilations are creatures from outer space close quote but most law enforcement would not stand up in front of my tv camera and say that on the record for fear of ridicule when my documentary of strange harvest was first broadcast on may 25 1980 it received the largest arbitron and nielsen audience rating in the history of kmgh tv and it&#x27;s never been broken that meant animal mutilations were of great interest to a lot of people in colorado and the surrounding states so i knew i was just scratching the surface of a large disturbing iceberg kept hidden from the public and the media by a strict u.s government policy of denial that had this mantra quote i heard it a hundred times there is nothing to animal mutilations except disease natural predators and satanic cults close quote none of that was true i knew it law enforcement knew it even the head of animal mutilation investigations at the royal canadian mounted police in calgary canada lynn lauber called to tell me he knew he was dealing with et&#x27;s but in order to keep the public and the media off their backs the rm&#x27;s rcmp kept floating the phony story that a satanic cult called oh was responsible i went on from kmgh tv to sign a contract with home box office of march 21st 1983 to produce an hour nonfiction special entitled ufos the e.t factor that&#x27;s when i hit a hard deceptive wall of government counter intelligence that wanted to keep me from producing that hbo documentary i wrote all about that experience in my first book released in 1989 and in the newly updated second edition in december 2015 of an alien harvest further evidence linking animal mutilations and human abductions to alien life forms an alien harvest received the 2015 southwest book association&#x27;s best nonfiction award it means a lot because the material is so difficult i&#x27;ve also pretty produced three more books the two volume glimpses of other realities and a book about my research of the crop formation phenomenon entitled mysterious lights and crop circles last year i also produced an hour earth files dvd entitled 10 000 bc gobekli tepe and ancient stone circles is it et terraforming in addition to my work as a writer tv producer and documentary filmmaker i began in 1992 to produce radio reports about science environment and unexplained phenomena on the nationally syndicated radio broadcast dreamland hosted by art bell and a second internationally acclaimed program with art called coast to coast am the dreamland title is slang used at nellis air force base nevada to describe the top secret area 51 where highly classified technology and craft are stored and tested no one argues with that but for a long time some have said there are extraterrestrial craft that are hidden behind and below the papoose mountain range that rises along area 51. several of my radio interviews have concerned research about alleged extraterrestrial vehicles that had crashed near several places beyond roswell to capitan mountain las cruces socorro magdalena and farmington new mexico crash retrieval artifacts and entities were taken to los alamos laboratory for top secret protection in the 1947-1948 time period some of those radio broadcasts that i did from england and italy were in the summer and fall of 1995. that&#x27;s when scenes of a six-fingered and six-toed humanoid dissection and craft debris were broadcast in the uk and united states amid intense controversy about whether or not the film was actually historic i was in london i was in the offices of santilli and orbital inc i saw not only what was broadcast to the uk and american audiences but i saw the private interview the entire interview that he uh filmed with the original photographer at the army site inside of a tent of some of what we&#x27;re going to talk about today and so from my point of view even though you will have people want to go into slugfest over this it&#x27;s real the santilli film is real counter intelligence went in overtime to convince the world that it was a hoax it&#x27;s not in fact i&#x27;ve had several whistleblowers tell me the film of this disc and the artifacts with it and the bodies our art and the six-fingered humanoids crashed specifically on may 31st 1947 southeast of aragon new mexico about five to ten miles north of elk mountain at the western end of the plains elk mountain is here here&#x27;s aragon here&#x27;s roswell roswell&#x27;s about 274 five miles east aragon here reserve is another one of the places that over the last since the 40s for those of us who have done actual discussions with people who were alive and heard the local scuttlebutt the town of reserve it&#x27;s always been in people&#x27;s discussions and nobody could quite figure it out and now all the pieces are beginning to come together reserve an aragon and elk mountain all of them came in separate discussions but on a map they&#x27;re very close together by april 1996 art bell and i received a series of letters each postmarked from south carolina and signed only a friend the first letter was dated april 10 1996 and included several pieces of square cut gray metal pieces allegedly cut from one of the many ufo crash vehicles in new mexico but without giving a specific date in sight here&#x27;s this this letter dear mr bell i have followed your broadcasts over the last year or so and have been considering whether or not to share with you and your listeners some information related to the roswell ufo crash now that everybody interprets as between july 2nd and july 6 1947 but we now know there&#x27;s no question there were other crashes in the months before july 1947 the first official crash that fdr and general george marshall and truman who was head of the senate committee democratic senate committee having to do with the dod budget the all of let&#x27;s cordell hall who was the secretary of state they all knew by april of 1941 that three clone beings they were identical and a craft that was also described as wedge-shaped came down in cape girardeau missouri the six full years before the week that we have all heard about and for those of you who are familiar with my work you know that at earth files and at coast and at dreamland and phenomenon radio and a whole lot of others i have been reporting about all of this new breaking news with many many facts now about the 1941 cape girardeau and why i&#x27;m stressing this the united states government was not broadsided by what happened in roswell and they knew that there was or were many craft that they already in the 1941 documents between fdr and george marshall and vannevar bush and all of them they were referring to them as plan forms as celestial as interplanetary plan forms all of those are words in legitimate documents that are now bob wood and ryan wood and stanton friedman they all are saying those documents uh the mj 12 documents from the 1947 period in 1952 are real and and this is important for you all even if you haven&#x27;t been through the slugging paths that i and some have been reading all these documents and talking with so many people i&#x27;m telling you the united states of america government was aware of an alien presence before we got into world war ii all the way during world war ii and the policies of denial that have been set in stone before since winston churchill and eisenhower agreed have been there roswell comes into play in a very interesting way that has to do with our trying to shoot down the craft and they&#x27;re retaliating so i&#x27;m giving you a little background that this there&#x27;s a reason why this letter should be listened to because there were so many crashes my grandfather was a member of a retrieval team sent to the crash site just after the incident was reported and i think it is nero score peak he died in 1974 but not before he had sat down with some of us and talked about the incident i am currently serving in the military and hold a security clearance and do not wish to go public and risk losing my career in commission even though i&#x27;m not going to go into it about two months after i had been on the radio reporting about all of this i got a phone call where i was living in philadelphia and the voice said i am the one who has sent you the bismuth magnesium and the aluminum i am in the army i&#x27;m on my way to iraq i do not know if i will survive and i wanted you to know that what i sent to you well to art bell and then he had me research what i said is real it was in my grandfather&#x27;s box that we got after his death it has a diary that&#x27;s where my information has been coming from and i just want you to know because i may never ever come back that what i&#x27;ve sent really was from my grandfather nonetheless i would like to briefly tell you what my own grandfather told me about roswell in fact i enclosed for your safe keeping samples that were in the possession of my grandfather until he died and which i have had since his own estate was settled as i understand it they came from the ufo debris and were among a large batch subsequently sent to wright-patterson air force base in ohio from new mexico it wasn&#x27;t called wright patterson in the 1947 period it was still becoming out of right field into what we know as wright patterson today and a lot of people just call it wright patterson historically my grandfather was able to appropriate them i do not know how this occurred because we will hear other discussions he is surrounding a security team this thing is glowing and at some point the light after three hours dims and allegedly he goes and pulls pieces that&#x27;s the appropriation i don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible but that&#x27;s the description and stated that the metallic samples are quote pure extract aluminum close quote you will note that they appear old and tempered and they have been placed in tissue paper and in baggies for posterity i&#x27;ve had them since 1974 and after considerable thought and reflection i give them to you feel free to share them with any of your friends in the ufo research community i have listened to many people over the years discuss roswell and the crash events as reported by many who were either there or who heard about it from eyewitnesses the recent roswell movie and he is referring to the 1995 race in telefilm of the six-fingered and six-toed beings that recent roswell movie was similar to my grandfather&#x27;s own account but a critical element was left out and it is that which i would like to share as my grandad stated the tech the team arrived at the crash site just after the army air force reported the ground zero location they found two dead occupants hurled free of the disc a lone surviving occupant was found within the disk and it was apparent its left leg was broken that word disc this is another thing that those of us who have investigated for a long time the shape is a triangle or a wedge but in 1947 the headlines in newspapers were flying saucer from kenneth arnold and disc and so what you find is in social generations even if it is a cylinder a triangle a sphere something that looks like a dumbbell all these different shapes or a disc or a something that&#x27;s a triangle they they will say they will call it disc and that is what&#x27;s happening here because uh all of the descriptions and everything that we know about what actually was retrieved from three sites in between july 2nd and 6th of 1947 were all wedge-shaped none of them were round a lone surviving occupant was found within the disk and it was apparent that its left leg was broken there was a minimal radiation contamination and it was quickly dispersed with a water solvent wash and soon the occupant was dispatched for medical assistance and isolation the bodies were sent to the wright-patterson air force base for dispersal the debris was also loaded onto three trucks which finished the on load just before the sunset granddad was part of the team that went with the surviving occupant the occupant communicated via telepathic means it spoke perfect english and communicated the following the disc was a probe ship dispatched from a launch ship that was stationed at the dimensional gateway to the terran referring to earth the terran solar system i know this sounds like star trek you can imagine what art bell and i thought back in 1996 when we got this but but today it seems mild compared to william mills tompkins talking about draco and other galaxies and that there&#x27;s lynn buchanan the remote viewer says we already have intergalactic trade and the government is is sitting on that uh so in the context of 2016 this seems more reasonable the occupants were part of a race of explorers from the solar system 32 light years from terra they had been conducting operations on terra for over a hundred years another group were exploring mars and eo and eo is one of the moons of mars now today in july 2016 according to the atlas of the universe website only five stars are listed at around the 32 light years distance from earth and they are 61 or say majoris and [Music] it is a orange yellow g8 main sequence star in the constellation ursa major it is a bit smaller and fainter than our sun and so far they don&#x27;t know that it has stellar sub-companions but in the context of what has been reported in non-fiction this is very or in fiction it is very interesting that this star 61 ursa majoris has shown up who knows what government input there has been in the 1966 film the warriors and the book of the shape of space 1969 star trek did an entire uh segment on on this implant this particular planet and a 1986 project called 2300 a.d and as you go through these you will find that each one of them has shown up in fiction since the 1960s why and alpha mensae on that list is the brightest star in the constellation mensah and this star has a classification of a g7 indicating that it is a g-type main sequence star it&#x27;s generating energy by fusing hydrogen into helium at its core very similar to our sun and it&#x27;s located doesn&#x27;t it not exactly at 32 as this man said but located about 33 light years from the sun and that an infrared excess has been detected around the star most likely indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk at a radius of over 147 astronomical units the temperature of the dust is below 22 kelvin and so they think it&#x27;s either a solar system or a solar system developing and you go through each of these stars and there are great interests in all five in terms of they are sort of in the sequence of our solar system so not one of them is identified by this man and i think it&#x27;s interesting that there&#x27;s only five currently that would be at approximately a 32 light year distance in which there has been a tremendous amount of interest since the 1960s by somebody putting it out in fiction now continuing with the south carolina sources first letter with the metal pieces he says each probe ship carried a crew of three a launch ship had a crew of 100 that&#x27;s sort of what tompkins the naval flight engineer who has just had his 93 third birthday uh robert wood has done a book with him i did a two half hours on coast to coast long reports at earth files of dreamland some other radio shows like midnight in the desert with jimmy church all about william mills tompkins now for the first time in his long life and career talking about having knowledge of three types of extraterrestrials conflicts between blondes reptilians and grays that the planet earth is involved with trade routes even if we don&#x27;t understand it he has this huge gigantic picture of earth that is beyond anything we have been exposed before and he said that he checked with the naval admiral before he put this book out with bob wood justin came out in december and the admiral said don&#x27;t leave anything out the american people should know this and here&#x27;s another one like brian in antarctica william mills tompkins na who served in the navy was exposed to all kinds of extraterrestrial issues on the moon on mars throughout the solar system throughout the milky way galaxy in his work he said that he never was asked once to sign a non-disclosure agreement but he insists that he was shown lunar mars and other photographs of where there were non-humans active in the the photos were of active et&#x27;s in those places so he he&#x27;s not guilty in the united states of america of violating anything any more than brian in antarctica please keep that in mind and all of them none of these people have felt like they could tell anybody until the last year think about that the disc that crashed had collided with a meteor in orbit of terra and was attempting to compensate its flight vector but because of the collision the inner atmospheric propulsion system malfunctioned and the occupants had sent out a distress signal to their companions on mars the launch ship commander made the decision to authorize an attempted soft landing on the new mexican desert at the same time the inter-atmospheric propulsion system had a massive electrical burnout and the disc was soon virtually helpless there was another option available to the occupants but it involved activating the dimensional power plant for deep space travel another thing that william mills tompkins talks about in great detail however it opens an energy vortex around the disc for 1 500 miles in all directions activating the dimensional power plant would have resulted in the annihilation of the states of new mexico arizona california and portions of mexico possibly even further states would have been affected thus the occupants chose to ride the ship down and hope for the best they literally sacrificed their lives rather than destroy the population within their proximity also as we know today the issue of clones hybrids and prime intelligence is huge and i personally am convinced several other investigators are privately that most of the so-called pilots of craft it doesn&#x27;t matter which country which hemisphere i believe are cloned specifically like we would make vacuum cleaners to vacuum a rug these beings are cloned and programmed a sophisticated biological computer to mutilate animals abduct people fly around in disks that are made to crash on purpose in order to get technology into the hands of homo sapien for reasons that are still not quite clear the dimensional power plant was self-destructed and the inter-atmospheric propulsion system also deactivated to prevent the technology from falling into the hands of the terrans this was done in accordance with their standing orders in regards to any compromise with contact experiences granddads spent a total of 26 weeks in the team that examined and debriefed the lone survivor of the roswell crash granddad&#x27;s affiliation with the project ended when the occupant was to be transported to a long-term facility the alien was placed on board a u.s air force which would have been at the time still in that transition from the u.s airfield or air army airfield to u.s air force in july of 47. a u.s air force transport aircraft that was to be sent to washington d.c the aircraft and all aboard disappeared under mysterious and disturbing circumstances on route to washington dc it may interest you that three fighter aircraft dispatched to investigate a distress call from the transport experience many electrical malfunctioning system failures as they entered the airspace of the transport&#x27;s last reported location no crash or debris of the transport was ever found and the team was disbanded i realize i have likely shocked you with this bizarre and incredible account and seeking to remain unknown likely doesn&#x27;t do anything for my credibility and the metal samples only will likely add to the controversy but i know that you will take this with a grain of salt and i don&#x27;t blame you mr bell i just hope that you can understand my reasons and my own desire to maintain my career and commission i am passing through south carolina with an operational readiness mobility exercise and will mail this just prior to this exercise possibly from the charleston area i will listen to your broadcast to receive any acknowledging or confirmation that you have received this package this letter and the contents of this package are given to you with the hope that it helps contribute to discussion on the subject of ufo phenomena i agree with neil armstrong a good friend of mine who dared to say at the white house no less that there are things out there which boggle the mind and are far beyond our ability to comprehend sign me a friend the metal pieces sent by the south carolina writer were at least hard physical facts i could test i contacted a scientist in a major midwestern university who has helped me now for 20 years and still asks me not to reveal him he used a scanning electron microscope to examine structure and energy dispersive spectroscopy known as eds to analyze element composition he confirmed that these first metal pieces were greater than 99 percent aluminum of normal density after i reported those findings on the radio we received a second letter dated april 22nd 1996. further information regarding the roswell crash and my own grandfather&#x27;s affiliation would likely be potentially beneficial in your efforts at correlation and verification in this regard i can only say based on past conversations on the subject with grand ad that the retrieval team consisted of three segments the on-site team the in-house team and the security team the credentials of the team members weren&#x27;t only military related there were individuals with backgrounds from the university of colorado office of naval research army air force u.s army ucla and the atomic energy commission the national advisory committee on aeronautics the office of scientific research and development that was what vanivar bush headed and additionally there were consultants from england france and russia involved granddad stated their own analysis of the samples indicated it as pure extract aluminum as a conductor for the electromagnetic fields created in the propulsion systems however critically needed data was eliminated by the self-destruct mechanisms on the disk vehicle itself furthermore the occupant survivor of the crash refused to disclose technical information despite a series of interrogative attempts to extract technological data no means could be found to secure that information i have heard i probably have had eye to eye face to face discussions with 10 different people who have worked in our government who have had face to face with non-humans in the even category in which they have a translator the government started looking for translators in the end of the 40s and the 50s almost aggressively they know they knew that there are humans who can get the extraterrestrial telepathic communication very clearly and they knew that a vast majority of humans could not so the search for translators was to find people that they could take into classified programs and that would be their job and that was and is one of the keys to [Music] the fact that the non-humans have clearly had an agenda a chess game agenda and so the more that i&#x27;ve begun to understand that so many of these crashes could have been trojan horses you want to plant something to direct the united states or france or russia or whoever it is to go you go this direction for the next 25 years while we do this on earth a lot of that has happened one man told me [Music] after he retired from the defense intelligence agency he said linda we have finally caught on to how many red herring paths we&#x27;ve been sent down by technology we retrieve from crashes that had to have been done on purpose that&#x27;s why the cloned beings aren&#x27;t going to communicate to humans if the information is a threat to their bigger goal there were always two security team members present at every face-to-face meeting with the survivor the survivor had the ability to deduce thoughts and questions prior to them being asked that&#x27;s also it&#x27;s all part and parcel of the same thing one man said he was assigned in 1978 by a military superior it was in arizona they knew it was an extraterrestrial act it was energy that destroyed a dam water flowed and flooded a village our government had no idea why this man&#x27;s job was inside of a mj-12 moon dust unit and they went there and the goal was which non-humans did this and why and that they couldn&#x27;t get any communication unless they went to the evens and the ebons ended up sending some there there was a landing and a literal face to face if you all are uncomfortable with this discussion just know there are a lot of people without doubt who have had face to face in work in military assignments with these ebens and they hit the man experienced a telepathic download and he said linda everybody would like to go to starbucks and sit down with these et&#x27;s and learn about the universe and i&#x27;m telling you it ain&#x27;t going to happen because this is what he said when and he said i&#x27;m on assignment they&#x27;re telling me i am going to get a slowed down download that the gray is going to try to slow down it its telepathic operation and he said when the eyes connect you no longer are in control of anything and he said it was like having seven movies coming through his head with three-dimensional what looked like hieroglyphs he stressed that he said you think of egypt hieroglyphs he said i swear to god or etruscan he said there were these symbols and they were three-dimensional and they are going over these movies and he said the movies have heat cold pressure all of this in them and that when it was over he he fainted and they he said it is overwhelming this uh inability to take the telepathic download and and that this is a very crucial part of all of this and that deducing thoughts that why he thought that he had seven films is that he his mind was trying to ask questions but that everything that his mind his human mind was doing was being answered by all of this uh telepathic download even though the being was trying to slow it all down the disc itself was literally dissected and it was discovered that the propulsion system had actually fused together the many interior components there were control type devices forged in the shape of the alien hand which were assumed as controls and activation surfaces what is today fiber optic technology was part and parcel of the alien technology within the control panels albeit fused and melted when the self-destruct mechanism was activated there were westinghouse affiliated persons on the team and granddad always thought some of them had gone back with the et knowledge and incorporated it into the future research with the phone systems of course the military was concerned as to the ability of the aliens to enter our atmosphere at will undetected because they can be invisible to radar if they choose and thus they&#x27;re recommended to the president that a space program be set into motion and that a system of satellites be placed into orbit by 1957 and this satellite system be patched into the then do line early warning system which became later norad grandad stated that it was his opinion opinion that norad was formed not only to track possible icbms from hostile human nations but as an established detection system for ufo craft that is why the armed forces or that is why the nasa space agency has been incorporated by and large with our armed forces and there are so many classified missions this is my opinion the granddad prophesies such occurring as far back as 1971.</p>
<p>i&#x27;m scheduled to travel back to charleston air force base and then pope air force base i&#x27;ll mail this from somewhere in south carolina i&#x27;ll not likely communicate again my wife is concerned as i as i am that the intelligence agencies will put two and two together so it is inadvisable to further communicate this information i hope you understand my position i could likely face a court martial or sedition charges for stating some of this information and opinions you will be surprised at the extent of internal policies on this subject and the consequences for current commissioned officers talking about ufo phenomena i was surprised by astronaut edgar mitchell&#x27;s statements of recent data and i imagine there are many involved with roswell who are a bit upset at events underway however he is a man of outstanding character and integrity and knows where he speaks as do quite a few other astronauts i wish you all the best and will be listening i commend your courage and integrity i hope your listeners understand that the subject of roswell has great potential at extrapolating the truth about ufos and what has come to be known as a cosmic watergate stanton friedman&#x27;s phrase and it is only the tip of an iceberg granddad said that when the truth does come out humanity will be changed beyond comprehension he also said many of the in-house team lobby to release the information to the public not all of them were paranoid in trusting the public with the truth sign me still a friend back engineering extraterrestrial technology for american military and commercial development was well known to retired u.s army lieutenant colonel philip j corso former chief of the army&#x27;s foreign technology division in the early 1960s in the day after roswell his 1997 groundbreaking and best-selling book colonel corso described his assignment in 1961 to 63 to get extra terrestrial technology out of the pentagon storage into the hands of defense contractors his boss was general arthur trudeau then head of army research and development appointed by president dwight d eisenhower the colonel&#x27;s list of back engineered extraterrestrial technologies included night vision image intensifiers fibro optics super tenacity fibers lasers molecular aligned metallic alloys which is probably applicable to the bismuth magnesium integrated circuits micro miniaturization of logic boards particle beams electromagnetic propulsion systems and hand imprinted control panels this is what colonel corso wrote about the panels retrieved from a crescent-shaped extraterrestrial vehicle that crashed in new mexico and which sounds similar to the south carolina writer&#x27;s description quote the series of raised deck panels were indentations for the creature&#x27;s hand the indentations on these panels as the roswell field reports described them looked like the handprints pressed into the concrete at old grauman&#x27;s chinese theater in hollywood where the directional commands a series of electronic instructions transmitted directly from the creatures brains along their bodies and through the panels into the ship itself as if the ship were only an extension of the creature&#x27;s body colonel corso said that extraterrestrial bodies first went to right field in cincinnati ohio but after the u.s air force became its own separate branch of the service quote the remaining bodies stored at right along with a spacecraft were sent to norton air force base in california jay allen heineck and i and a friend had dinner on the first weekend of august of 1985. none of us knew that allen would be dead four months later or so in april from the aggressive brain tumor from his prostate cancer but that night he was agonizing with me and a friend about the fact that that summer he had been contacted to go to norton air force base same norton air force base to see different craft and different alien bodies that he said were underground at norton in something like a museum and he got to norton and then he was denied access and joe allen heineck at the end of his life sitting there with him at that dinner that night i&#x27;ll never forget how he grabbed a hold of my right arm at the dinner table strongly with tears in his eyes linda do you think that we&#x27;ll ever be vindicated in our lives experiments were carried out at norton and ultimately at nellis air force base in nevada at the famous green lake site area 51 known as dreamland where the stealth technology was developed close quote the colonel said that the u.s air force and cia maintained a kind of alien technology museum at norton air force base exactly what jay allen heineck had been told that he would see norton air force base was closed down in the 1990s and one wonders where the alien technology museum went or if it&#x27;s still there is it underground or disguised in some way like a library colonel corso said the motives of the extraterrestrials were puzzling and of great concern to government insiders when he worked in the white house national security staff under president dwight eisenhower and later in the pentagon under general arthur trudeau the priority of the u.s government was to get as much advanced extraterrestrial technology as possible keep it out of the hands of cold war enemies which specifically with the soviets or today&#x27;s russians while pushing through weapons development that might reduce the advantage of the advanced and potentially threatening non-human intelligence and colonel corso wrote on pages 180 to 182 in his book in the pentagon from 1961 to 1963 i reviewed field reports from local and state policy agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasses looked as though they had been systematically mutilated and reports from people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens and experimented upon one of the common threads in these stories were reports by the self-described abductees of being subjected to some sort of probing or even a form of surgery with controlled intense pencil thin beams of light close quote which colonel corso associated with laser instruments retrieved from downed spacecraft quote local police reported that when veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the dead cattle left in fields they often found evidence not just that the animal&#x27;s blood had been drained but that entire organs were removed with such surgical skill that it couldn&#x27;t have been the work of predators or vandals removing the organs for some depraved ritual i also remembered that both civilian and military intelligence personnel attached to the staffs of individuals who worked for the hill and ketter and twining working groups on ufos in the 1950s were actively engaging in research into the kinds of surgical methods that would produce crime scene evidence like this although the first public reports of cattle mutilation surfaced around 1967 in colorado at the white house we were reading about the mutilation stories that have been kept out of the press as far back as the middle 1950s especially in the area around colorado our intelligence organizations and especially the working group believed that the cattle mutilations that could not be obviously explained away as pranks predators or ritual slaughter were the results of interventions by extraterrestrials who were harvesting specific organs for experimentation that means genetic harvesting to create clones hybrids and various kinds of manipulations on this planet and through the solar system we had irrefutable evidence that eba&#x27;s extraterrestrial biological entities were landing on farms harvesting vital organs from livestock and then just leaving the carcasses on the ground because they knew we could not do anything about it close quote the reference to helen ketter and uh just to so you&#x27;ll know the level at which our government was working helen ketter was a u.s navy admiral and he was the first director of the central intelligence agency and a member of truman&#x27;s mj-12 special studies group he was appointed specifically by harry truman and nathan twining was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff from 1957 to 1960 and he was a member of mj 12. the cur what is that a cell phone please i guess it&#x27;s sober stuff bring in some levity the colonel agreed the government had extraterrestrial artifacts from more than one spacecraft he said that during the norton air force based testing it was discovered that quote the entire vehicle functioned just like a giant capacitor the craft itself stored the energy necessary to propagate the magnetic wave that elevated it as if gravity were being folded around the outside of the wave that enveloped the craft somehow the pilots became part of the electrical circuitry of the vehicle vectoring it in a way similar to the way you order a voluntary muscle to move close quote the colonel told me how amazed military and science investigators were about the spacecraft functioning as an extension of the being&#x27;s neurological systems including their molecularly aligned and strengthened flight suits and hand imprinted control panels the six fingered hand and printed panels were filmed by a former u.s air force cameraman who said those panels were retrieved from a vehicle that crashed on may 31st 1947. another may 31st date has also been associated with a crash it was described to me by a new mexico resident he said he has talked to a ranch family in the plains of saint augustine who wanted to remain anonymous their story is that the former ranch owner his teenage son and a hired hand heard a loud explosion near their property on the evening of may 31st 1947 the father was outside on a tractor and saw something crash on a mesa a few miles north of elk mountain at the southern end of the plains and southeast of aragon the map that i showed in the beginning and now here is that map again in the next two days the rancher asked a magdalena doctor who had surveying equipment to help survey some property above his ranch the rancher his teenage son hired hand and doctor rode horseback up to about four thousand feet toward elk mountain there they saw an army helicopter hovering over what they first assumed was a crashed airplane very thin silver material was torn and scattered on the ground and military personnel were picking it up while the ranch owner talked to a military man about who was going to clean up his land and pay for any damage the doctor got off his horse and walked through some of the debris then a military policeman and an army officer approached and told the rancher he could not go further because it was an off-limits military zone so the four left the son said later he heard the doctor tell his dad that before the army kicked him out he found a body quote that was not human it had real big eyes and real strange looking arms and hands close quote the rancher&#x27;s son also remembered seeing a tent set up around tables covered with pieces of crash debris and one big piece that looked quote like a seat from a ferris wheel with a curved top close quote a few days later two army officers and a civilian brought u.s army damage claims claim forms to the ranch the son was asked to read and fill them out for his father who did not read or write when the father asked about the quote ship from mars and the martian lying on the ground the civilian with the army probably cia then that was formed september 18th 1947 by truman said it was a well it would not have been the cia if it&#x27;s if it&#x27;s may 31st that because it did not exist so it but everybody thinks that there was an intelligence agency here uh the civilian intelligence agent said it was quote a chimpanzee inside an experimental plane close quote swamp gas weather balloons on and on it goes so chimpanzee inside an experimental plane crashed into elk mountain when the father challenged that explanation the civilian intelligence agent offered to bypass the paperwork and pay the father cash then and there if the rancher would sign a statement relinquishing any claims against the united states government and would promise to turn over to the army anything else found at the crash site the rancher and doctor now deceased were certain there was a cover-up about a crash flying saucer but the only thing they heard in public after that was a military plane had crashed near reserve new mexico a little southwest of aragon new mexico that&#x27;s the story that&#x27;s why reserve got inserted into all of this a long time ago much to a lot of our confusions so reserve was counter intelligence elk mountain and aragon is probably where a crash occurred but the one with the bismuth magnesium i think was the score peak at white sands proving ground long time residents in the horse springs magdalena socorro and elk mountain areas do remember airplane crashes through the years but they don&#x27;t remember specifically a flying saucer crash but in research that i did for the ufo report sighting special that i produced for the fox network in 1991 i talked with socorro resident harold baca he had helped an elderly and sick man named barney barnett who lived across the street until barnett died in 1969. barnett had been a field engineer for the u.s soil conservation service and worked throughout the plains of santa augustin and stanton friedman nuclear physicist and long-time researcher of crash discs and government cover-up had reported in his 1992 book crash at corona the barnett&#x27;s close friend vern maltese and barnett&#x27;s niece alice knight remembered barney saying he had come upon a silver disc and small dead non-humans wearing one one-piece gray bodysuits somewhere in the plains of san agustin baca and barnett suspected his throat cancer was caused from bending down over the strange bodies but no one remembered an exact date and specific location arizona researcher victor golubik thinks there is other evidence to support a crash location about 10 miles south of horse springs on may 31 1947 which again would be in this area unfortunately the south carolina writer never gave a definite date either and the reference to between sierra blanca and the san mateo mountains is broad but it is white sands and oscara peak comes up in too many other discussions that i think that&#x27;s where this was i continue to investigate the possibility that the aluminum pieces might be punch outs from terrestrial machining operations since they measured as common terrestrial quarter inch and inch sizes however when i talked with people who were in the sci-tech area the science and technology area of alcoa aluminum those engineers thought that the purity they said it was above 99 essentially pure absolutely pure aluminum that it was not typical of anything they used in industrial machining so there was speculation that if the south carolina writers story were true the military handlers might have had samples from the alleged extraterrestrial craft itself punched out like they would do punch outs in a place like alcoa aluminum in squares to distribute to american scientists for study on may 27 1996 a third letter arrived containing a surprise six more pieces of metal that were very different from the aluminum the letter said dear mr bell i have listened with interest to the ongoing reports on the samples i sent your way which is me doing these reports in 1996 i noted that the researcher me discussing the testing of the samples noted that basically it is merely aluminum slight variations on the testing but indistinguishable from normal aluminum well not normal according to alcoa highly unusual to be so pure actually this is precisely the same initial findings of granddad&#x27;s team however i neglected to include metallic samples of the exterior of the crashed roswell disc i now include the enclosed and it can only say that these scrapings came from the exterior underside of the disc itself it literally was a shell-like shielding of the disc brittle and layered almost with a pre-fabricated design and placing keep in mind mr bell that these are the last of granddad&#x27;s samples they have sat for years inside a closet with his personal effects because of certain concerns i will not be contacting you on this matter perhaps i am a bit paranoid but i do have a family and career to think about i hope you understand hope these last samples are helpful i will be listening a friend artbell called me and said there were half a dozen pieces about two inches long an inch wide and about a quarter of an inch thick one side was dark and the other was a shiny silver i contacted the university professor again who had helped me with the aluminum and he agreed to analyze the new material so bell shipped two fragments to him keeping the other four in a safe deposit box the professor&#x27;s first step was to photograph the metal pieces as they arrived at his laboratory he placed the dark side of one piece on the left and the silver side of the other on the right both next to a quarter coin that is about an inch in diameter for size comparison on june 8 1996 the professor released his first report about the material he had examined a cut and polished cross section with a scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy and this is what he stated each sample had a silvery shiny side with a rough granular appearance the other side was blackish gray looking at the sample&#x27;s edge on numerous layers can be seen they averaged 26 to 30 layers alternating the samples were hard but brittle and a few small pieces could be broken off using a small hand vise and manual pressure energy dispersive spectroscopy eds revealed that the shiny side contained more than 95 magnesium and a small amount two to three percent of zinc the material appears to represent layers consisting mainly of magnesium the small amount of zinc separated by thin layers containing what appears to be almost pure bismuth in fact in an ion micro microprobe we could not even find any lead and on the periodic elements chart bismuth and lead are right next to each other bismuth is a denser than lead but usually you find lead with bismuth in carnegie institute in washington we could not find any lead in the bismuth layers in these samples the scanning electron microscope was set in a back scattering configuration so that heavier elements show up brighter therefore the dark bismuth appears as thin white lines and the much brighter lighter magnesium zinc shows as darker shades of gray the professor measured the layers and found that the thin wavy lines of bismuth varied from one to four microns which is about half the diameter of a human blood cell and the magnesium zinc varied from 100 to 200 microns one scientist thought the waviness might be a fractal wave pattern calculated in the layered materials construction perhaps to better resonate with a specific frequency or the waviness might be the result of heat absorbed in the metals production or function and today several people think if there was a self-destruct mechanism that destroyed the propulsion system deliberately and that the alien that was retrieved would not address anything about the propulsion system on that craft that the wavy lines that run very consistently through all of these very well-shaped pieces of layered metal it might be that we are seeing the artifact artifacts of extreme heat from that event this is not clear it&#x27;s confusing later the professor did more we find analysis with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy he said i&#x27;m getting ahead of myself here the material corresponds to layers of bismuth and magnesium zinc with a weight percent of the zinc varying slightly from about 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent between nearly pure bismuth layers there&#x27;s no zirconium that could be detected with the magnesium zinc area which is frequently found in magnesium zinc alloys close quote in summary the metal fragments allegedly from the central underside of a wedge-shaped spacecraft found in new mexico have about 25 to 30 alternating layers the bismuth layers average one to four microns and the magnesium zinc layers average 100 to 200 microns one exotic metals manufacturer that i talked to in new jersey back in 1996 he was one of the first people i called i just wanted to know who makes it how do you make it where is it on earth what can it do i just wanted to know honestly this is the first thing he said to me quote no one laminates bismuth and magnesium it cannot be done 1996.</p>
<p>bismuth is a hard brittle metallic element that is grayish white with a tinge of red and that pink color in the stomach medicine pepto-bismol comes from a bismuth ingredient bismuth&#x27;s atomic number on the periodic table of elements is 83 lead is 82 so bismuth is heavier than lead bismuth is frequently found in ores of 10 lead copper and cobalt bismuth is not attacked by hydrochloric acid and only slightly by hot sulfuric acid but the element is rapidly dissolved by either dilute or concentrated nitric acid further the guide to uncommon metals says bismuth is one of the few metals that expands when cooled like water does when it turns to ice and that makes bismuth valuable for detailed metal castings because it will expand into the cracks in the shape this myth also has a low melting point but its thermal conductivity is lower than that of perhaps every other metal with the exception of mercury and its electrical resistance is high a modern use is as a coolant for nuclear power reactors close quote bismuth is the most diamagnetic of all the elements it resists penetration by magnetic fields more strongly than any other element magnetic field lines tend to be displaced around bismuth rather than passing through it bismuth also has the greatest hall effect that means if a voltage is placed on bismuth while the metal is in a magnetic field a current flow will be induced that is 90 degrees to the voltage bismuth is an efficient absorber of infrared energy and researchers are experimenting with bismuth coatings that will convert heat to electricity bismuth is also added to metal mixtures in super conducting research and just as a side note beyond how put off i sent this medal in 96 to a major superconductor researcher how put off talk with people at los alamos i talked to a lot of people in who are researching superconductivity every single one of them was interested in bismuth not anybody had ever heard of bismuth and magnesium didn&#x27;t even know how to do it but it&#x27;s interesting to me that that is the element that in 1996 to this day that a lot of people in superconducting efforts that there is something about bismuth that seems that research is trying to understand how that might be applied on july 5th 1996 a fourth and final letter to art bell from the south carolina source added a few more comments quote sample extraction radiated light for a full three hours this is from the center of the bottom of a wedge-shaped triangular craft originally located on central underside of wedge-shaped disk speculate some type of shielding to enable craft and crew to survive accelerated entry into atmosphere when craft was experiencing uncontrolled descent the pile of blackened ash was analyzed and the ash was confirmed to be of the same elements of the layering the ash consisted of fibrous dust and residue ash and all debris swept into bagging bags placed in tagged boxes boxes placed into metal foot lockers initial examination off-site conducted at the new mexico institute of mining and technology secondary examinations at los alamos facility foot lockers subsequently airlifted by courier to right field ohio close quote in addition to the unfamiliar combination of bismuth and magnesium zinc there were questions about the isotope ratios in the magnesium isotope refers to the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of each atom for example magnesium on earth is made up of about 80 percent magnesium 24. that means there are 12 protons and 12 neutrons at the center of each magnesium 24 atom the other 20 percent is equally divided between magnesium 25 which has one additional neutron compared to magnesium 24 and magnesium 26 which has two additional neutrons compared to magnesium 24. if the layered metal were truly extraterrestrial in origin some wondered if anomalies might be detected in those ratios or percentages of isotopes one such anomaly that some of you probably have heard about was reported in 1957 when a metal fragment allegedly from a ufo in yubatuba sao paulo brazil was analyzed by the brazilian government in laboratory tests the fragment was found and reported on september 14 1957 after eyewitnesses saw a flying disc explode into thousands of fiery fragments which fell onto the beach and the sea the metal tested to be nearly 100 percent pure magnesium and was 6.7 percent heavier than ordinary pure magnesium former nasa scientist paul hill who is the author of the 1995 book unconventional flying objects a scientific analysis it is considered required reading by anybody serious in this field paul hill calculated that the density anomaly could be explained if the metal were the pure isotope magnesium 26 not found naturally on earth supposedly that&#x27;s what he found and then what happened the report came out and the metal disappears no way for anybody to do a reality check i learned that an ion microprobe which could analyze magnesium i don&#x27;t know why these images look so silk screeny here i learned that there was an ion micro microprobe which could analyze magnesium isotopes and it had just been installed at the carnegie institution of washington dc back in 96 and after discussions with dr eric howery in the department of terrestrial magnetism he agreed to analyze the layered bismuth magnesium metal i drove to washington dc from philadelphia where i lived at the time on july 20 1996. he took the piece of cut and polished bismuth magnesium and put it in this cage to put it into the ion microprobe dr howey found about 11 more magnesium 26 in our mysterious sample but still not outside terrestrial ranges for magnesium metal one anomaly was that the bismuth magnesium layered material emitted more positive ions than the pure magnesium metal being used for standard comparison i was there with him eight hours and the eight hours half of them were his own scientific curiosity he had a controlled piece of magnesium and he would put it in and then he would put in the bismuth magnesium in the cage he would go back and forth and over four hours he was frustrated because he couldn&#x27;t understand why he was getting 60 times the emission of positive ions out of the sample and he he did it for four hours another work because he said i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m dealing with a machine anomaly i don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;m dealing with here but he said this is definitely out of the normal and he never did understand he said the bismuth magnesium sample gave count rates of positive magnesium ions which were enhanced 60 times more than in the pure magnesium metal standard he suggested three possible reasons for the difference first he explained that the zinc might act as a catalyst for magnesium ionization second the catalytic process might be enhanced if there were a distinctive arrangement in the magnesium crystal structure which related to how the material was originally constructed and i think every every advanced scientist who has dealt with this thinks uh in fact the cranford lab in london uh they had it for a month in december of 1996 and my question to them they weren&#x27;t charging anything they wanted to look at it they said it was definitely the arrangements of the atoms in the bismuth and magnesium appeared to be calculated by intelligence i believe is the way they put it third if oxygen were somewhere in the sample it could enhance magnesium ionization but how he said there was nothing in any of the ion microprobe spectra that showed any oxygen whatsoever another scientist tried to make it this was a guy who was working in solar cell manufacturing he took to vacuum vapor deposition i was in his lab i watched the beginning he slowed down the vacuum process to building a layer one layer of bismuth and then one layer of magnesium zinc trying to match one layer every seven days and he made four layers in 28 days and he sent me what he made with vacuum vapor deposition using as close to the percentages of what we were dealing with in magnesium zinc and bismuth and it was so funny to me because here is this beautiful strange material that may have been altered in ways we have not a clue in a deliberate shoot down or whatever it is alien and it was doing something on the bottom of a wedge-shaped vehicle and the humans are trying to duplicate it and he sends me these four layers that took one month to make it was a square inch like a postage stamp and within 10 days of keeping it in a plastic bag on a shelf never touching it all of the bismuth delaminated it looked like i had pepper i had little white they weren&#x27;t silver there was nothing about it that looked like this but it was just so interesting that this guy and uh another person at los alamos said well we can do it if we apply money and this guy said well i can do it i can do it with vacuum vapor deposition no did not make it nobody has made it uh i&#x27;ve talked about this with hal put off i would welcome anybody here and beyond if you can find anyone anywhere who can duplicate magnesium zinc in the 96.4 2.6 alloy and it is essentially pure bismuth one to four microns sandwiched with 100 to 200 microns nobody knows why it was made what it did and nobody seems to be able even in 2016 to accept the challenge it keeps being repeated out there somebody make this well i kept reporting all of this work on dreamland and asked if anyone listening had any information about the construction or function of this and i contacted the director of material sciences at mit in cambridge i contacted the national science foundation i talked with metallurgists at sandia national laboratory in albuquerque i talked with aerospace and exotic metals manufacturers i had a notebook of all the people and addresses in front of a whole spiral notebook of all these people trying to find something about this and no one had any knowledge of such a layered material specul metals possible function included resisting or detecting magnetic fields and this led to research with travis taylor down at our redstone army arsenal i went down there he took a piece of the bismuth magnesium and put it on a plastic insulator and it was a van de graaff and we had gotten information from a whistleblower try it with a very specific amount of energy and then also which was about 500 000 volts and then add a seven megahertz radio signal do it two ways and we did and he thought he had controlled this is what he did for a living for the department of defense in the defense intelligence agency it&#x27;s a first-class physicist and he even asked the dia can i work with linda bolton howe on this bismuth magnesium material he called me up and he said they know all about you they seem to listen to you on the radio they&#x27;re very interested in this bismuth magnesium layered material you&#x27;re reporting about with our bell and they said yeah you can work with her as long as every single thing that you do and find you report back to the defense intelligence agency and we laughed because it said to us they didn&#x27;t know any what it was either travis was puzzled said maybe that waviness relates to if you have a kind of propulsion system that is dealing with manipulating magnetic field lines maybe there is something that if you can layer with bismuth that is so diamagnetic that you can control in either dynamic magnetic fields or static magnetic fields neutralizing gravity and turn it something into a lifting body so he said i know somebody who is working for the dod on anti-gravity right now in california they&#x27;re very interested in getting a piece of this he said i will give you my personal promise if you&#x27;ll send a piece they would but you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t interview anybody you can&#x27;t say the name of the company uh but for sure let&#x27;s see if this will react will it turn into a lifting body in dynamic or static magnetic fields ranging through a whole series of frequencies so a guy in california had a piece for two months many interesting phone calls but they travis i was there and here we had the piece it&#x27;s actually on a video and i just don&#x27;t have it converted to dvd i should do that the when the when the seven megahertz signal was turned on in addition to the 500 000 volt field and only then when we did it off on off on with that seven megahertz radio frequency signal the bismuth magnesium that was sitting on plastic started doing this and at one point it moved this way and all of a sudden and eric was not sure what he did he went to adjust the radio frequency and the magnesium literally leaped out into the air and onto the floor that was a lifting body but not exactly the way we thought whatever the lord bismuth and magnesium zinc&#x27;s function might be it does remain a mystery to this day the information from the south carolina source could be a controlled government release into public consciousness without the political commitment of official sanction there&#x27;s lots of that being done through reporters hollywood it&#x27;s happening everywhere in this case i think this guy i think this was a real army guy with a real grandfather who really did serve security if government insiders do know about layered bismuth magnesium and the extraterrestrial wet-shaped craft their silence is consistent with a policy of cover-up since at least the early 1940s at least one political representative that i know knows a lot about new mexico ufos and our government strict policy of lies and silence about the alien presence on earth his former new mexico state representative andrew kistner who told me about his official research into the 1947 v2 rocket program ufo crashes and retrievals in new mexico he had off the record conversations with military and intelligence operatives from white sands missile range and the naval research lab that is housed at white sands and has been housed there since the after the war when we were setting rockets the navy has always been intimately involved with ufos representative kistner had assembled many old newspaper articles and some leaked documents that he shared with me and he said that he learned from the naval research lab contact at white sands that in the 1940s to early 1950s there was an american government policy to shoot down unidentified aerial discs and leonard stringfield told me the same thing at his house eye to eye that he when he was in the air force the reason he became so interested in ufos is that he knew that there was a secret policy that the united states was deliberately trying to use microwaves and anything it could to shoot down extraterrestrial i&#x27;ll use the word or alien presence technology in the skies but the truth is to kissner streamfield and a whole long list the craft always retaliated the craft always retaliated it is one of the biggest best kept secrets that sentence alone i could do another two hours many of our pilots died which forced an end forced an end that&#x27;s what len stringfeld told me all the way back in the 80s to our shoot down policy andy kistner said he learned that president harry s truman ordered a policy of denial in the interest of national security about all ufo crash retrievals he was scared they had plain civilian planes that were being taken out of the skies and crashes by ufos they knew it his classified order that said all of this secrecy and lies and black programs and i think a black underbelly of the united states of america that is part of the reason why we are in such a mess today so corrupt and unethical because when you have trillions of dollars that are going to programs that are not ever to be made public to the surface life of earth it means that everything that&#x27;s happening on the surface of the earth is concocted and if you concoct a surface layer to hide and camouflage the underground layer the insidious corruption that that automatically brings explains a lot about 2016. to underscore the reality of the extraterrestrial presence and government knowledge about it i would like to share excerpts from a videotaped interview that i did on april 24th 2006 with one of the few military sources in my career who has been willing to talk on the record on camera with their face about extraterrestrial biological entities his name is thomas coleman shepard he served in the united states navy from september 1975 until his retirement 20 years later in 1995 as an e-7 chief petty officer chief yeoman tom is now 62 years old and wants to be on the record about his extraterrestrial knowledge because he told me quote i can&#x27;t believe our government is still keeping it a secret close quote tom strongly feels that the public should be told the truth here is thomas coleman shepard&#x27;s naval history of assignments from march 26 1976 to 1978 with the amphibious group one pack at white beach in okinawa japan now we&#x27;re going back 40 years to thanksgiving night in 1976.</p>
<p>tom was stationed at white beach naval base in okinawa at the time he was a seaman apprentice to the staff of the commander of the amphibious group one most of his work was clerical that thanksgiving night he was in the administration building with two other men robert turman and craig howard howard was mechanically gifted and liked to prove he could get into sensitive areas that were off limits that thanksgiving night 40 years ago craig howard had gotten into a vault that contained classified material and was yelling for turman to join him tom shepard watched as turman ran by into the administration office that contained the vault shepard wondered what howard had found that was so urgent listen now as retired navy chief yeoman tom shepard tells what happened and i saw howard go into the vault [Music] his eyes and they said that it&#x27;s true well this really caught my attention so i was i mean i was really astounded to hear you know this kind of reaction from him so then he calls me over and says come on so i go in there right and it&#x27;s a vault and it&#x27;s a small room it&#x27;s got the filing cabinets and the safes and it&#x27;s i&#x27;ve got a table right there in the middle of the vault tables about the size of this but square taller and on that on that table he had this file laid out and this file was i mean it was like all spread out on the table here okay and it had photographs and documents and the covers and everything and he said this is what it&#x27;s all about and he handed me one of the photographs and i looked there and i had no idea what i was looking at it was a an old black and white photograph it had a old truck in it and down on the ground and you could tell they were out in the desert was some sort of a creature that looked like well what i would call now an alien creature but i had no idea what i was looking at back then so i said well what am i looking at here he goes what do you think i said i don&#x27;t know he said alien creature from outer space your big dummy oh my god no it was not and he goes you&#x27;re looking right at one of these and you still can&#x27;t believe it don&#x27;t believe it that&#x27;s incredible so i looked at that photograph then i i looked at the another photograph that had him laid out on a skid and uh looked at two other photographs they had a very dark black background and one of them was a head shot and the other photograph was of an elongated shot on a type of gurney and i looked at the documents and there was a lot of uh you know red ink top secret uh one of the words was magic and magic was spelt with a j and i even made a comment to howard i said look here they can&#x27;t even spell magic rarity to spell it with a j it just looked like an old file but the the gauge of the year would have to be from the uh the 30s or the 40s just based on the truck the uh the aliens sort of look like that one down the roswell museum that they&#x27;re different too because it&#x27;s black and white you can really get a lot of uh tone with the kind of skin i had but if i had to describe it at all it would have been like like snake skin in sort of way can you explain that further it had a whitish kind of appearance but you could tell it had some color to it and if i had to describe it as much as any other type of animal that i know of it would have been like like that of a white snake say and could you discern scales not really no no but you can tell that they were they were they just look like bumps and who knows what they were and it was throughout but mostly like on the arm area and and on the head area and was this being wearing any clothes no you could tell it and here are some renditions of uh drawings that i made of the photographs that i saw in okinawa and what you have here is a desert and the alien entity here&#x27;s the guy in the jeans and the cowboy boots here&#x27;s the truck and here&#x27;s the entity in the truck looking out and in the actual photograph though you could barely make him out because of the angle of the sun and and what it was doing from the slats to him so i had to actually have this pointed out to me this is what we call the photograph number one this is another rendition this is at the aircraft hangar okay um pretty much this is this is really a rendition because of the angle i really am not an artist okay so i couldn&#x27;t really draw it to the right angle but over here is the military man in his khaki pants his brown shoes and this is the front of the aircraft hanger this is the opening here and i tried what really stood out for me in this photograph was the angle of the slants from the uh the panes of the windows from the um the uh the hanger of the style of hanger that it was and here&#x27;s the alien that&#x27;s mostly intact and next to him or it is the other alien that that was crumbling in a fetal position and most of its side had been badly damaged and here&#x27;s the alien that sticks to it and i tried to make a rendition here of the crumpling and everything but i didn&#x27;t do a good job really but most of its head as i recall was badly damaged either through charring of some sort or other damage or burn yeah okay and there&#x27;s another rendition now in the photograph this is of course all black okay but what you&#x27;re seeing is where the flash took the photograph of what you can see here and it&#x27;s a gurney in an alarm grid in fashion okay and the alien entity laying on top of the gurney and there you have it and evidently in the same space they took a close-up of the aliens um head from the neck on up with the same black background and here it is as our best recall i tried to get as best to make it look as as real as i could by not giving too much detail with the eyes but the eyes the sockets are very almond shaped and they they&#x27;re fatter up here and they skinny down okay they&#x27;re fatter here and they skinny down and the blotting i&#x27;m trying to describe here okay uh looks sort of uh well veiny i guess you could say or just bumps and and that was the best i can describe it here and this reminded you of reptilian yeah you could tell that it was sort of what tell english but at the same time no you really couldn&#x27;t because the black and white photo okay i do recall that it&#x27;s uh that was in comparison to its head really this skinny and it had a lot of wrinkles as if it were old no as if it was just the way it was the way it was but did that remind you also of a reptile yeah i tried to make a description of how long its fingers are and in comparison to its wrist this is a better drawing okay if it&#x27;s a hat palm in this fashion all right without a thumb they had a thumb it was just sort of a nib looking thing here and it did have these slanted tip fingertips and on the tips you could tell the sole of a around this or what i call a suction cup there is nothing on this earth that we know of that looks anything like this it&#x27;s not a human being i&#x27;m telling you straight up it wasn&#x27;t a monkey it wasn&#x27;t an animal of any kind it was like nothing that i had ever seen then that&#x27;s all i could say it was definitely not a human it was definitely not an animal that we know of what emotion did you feel i was in shock i mean like i said i didn&#x27;t want to believe it i i couldn&#x27;t even accept it at the time it took hours for me to even accept what i had saw even with a guy that was older than me that was telling me look at what you&#x27;re looking at here okay these were not fakes this was real stuff i was overwhelmed tom shepard and his two navy colleagues craig howard and robert turman thought that they had been able to enter the classified vault without anyone finding out but on the monday after that 1976 thanksgiving weekend the three men were summoned by a very angry chief james sealy tom saw the other two men had to put on their dress uniforms for some kind of punishment and he was kept in office detention for several hours but thomas shepard was never asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement swearing him to secrecy for the rest of his life two weeks after their vault adventure captain seeley ordered tom shepard robert turman and craig howard to drive with him to a dentist at kadena air force base about an hour from white beach tom was put to sleep and was never told what the dentist did he thinks that the other two men were treated the same way but his navy records mysteriously never included one word about the kadena air force base dentist visit i asked tom if the dentist might have implanted monitoring devices in the men&#x27;s teeth tom said that a few years later he learned that was possible to do and figured that is what had been done the tooth had bothered him after the okinawa dennis visit and he finally had it pulled out in the 1990s by a civilian dentist in the united states and the dentist asked him quote when did you do intelligence work close quote tom told the dentist that he had never done intelligence work but he did not tell the dentist about what had happened in okinawa several months after the three men were taken to the kadena air force-based dentist tom finally learned more from craig howard that the vault photos and files were from a ufo crash near roswell new mexico in the late 1940s it was probably a couple of months after the incident that finally came up to howard and i said okay what was all that and and tell me what you know about what we saw and he told me about roswell and he said that he said two things really he said that he had heard of roswell before and that he did see roswell in those documents and that the flying saucers or whatever we wanted to call them at the time did crash in new mexico in the 40s and that the and that the government or the military whatever you want to call it okay i recovered the bodies and we&#x27;ve been hiding them ever since i eventually transferred in a march of 78 topin got accepted for a naval officer candidate school program and um howard transferred sometime in 77 and i&#x27;ll never forget that day either whatever well he had made second class which was e5 okay and um i thought he was doing really good and they&#x27;re at the last minute or within weeks of having to um to have gotten to re-enlist he backed out so i came up to him on the day he was he was leaving he was in his uniform and i said howard you know what kids man you know life is good you made second class why are you getting out he said tom i i just can&#x27;t do it no more i said does it have anything to do with they said the vault you know what we saw in that and he looked at me and he got beat red and he was shaking his finger at me and he said don&#x27;t you ever bring that up to me again and that was the last thing i ever heard from him and i haven&#x27;t seen him in over 30 years now did you take it from that comment that he had been punished because of the vault incident i believe that well it&#x27;s either one of two things i think they jacked with him myself i think they gave him threats but um it could have been just that he knew a truth and it was gonna it wasn&#x27;t gonna go anywhere now he didn&#x27;t like that were you asked to sign any kind of a non-disclosure agreement no never let&#x27;s jump ahead to 1989. unsolved mysteries comes on tv and it was a popular show then and one night they played robert stack hosting the roswell incident and i had no idea at the time that this was in books or uh had already been talked about i was literally blown away and i thought to myself well you know national tv is going to come out and blast it all over the place what&#x27;s to stop me so at the time i worked at a three-star commander in norfolk it was com navarre land and i worked for the operations department it&#x27;s code 30 and one of the people in code 30 was a man named captain wood and he had a person that worked for him who was a lieutenant commander and i don&#x27;t remember his last name but one day shortly after this was played on tv the roswell incident on unsold mysteries the subject of et&#x27;s came up and we were just talking and even though i had been well i&#x27;ve run into a lot of trouble and other commands not a lot of trouble but well somewhat anyway okay we can get into that but i had opened my mouth before okay and i was tired of keeping it closed so i told this lieutenant commander who worked for captain wood what i knew and i told him the whole okinawa story and the file and the photos and the whole thing and i thought the guy was going to have a heart attack he went into shock he got really angry he wanted to tape record me he started making threats on me we got to sort of a heated argument and he said but he was going to have to tell captain ritt about this so i said fine doubt so a couple hours later captain wood calls me in his office he says sit down heard you did some talking today and i said yes sir it sure did you wanna tell me what you told lieutenant commander down there all right so i told him the whole okinawa story and i said all right i&#x27;m pretty convinced that you saw what you saw but um just so you know we don&#x27;t call them aliens i said we don&#x27;t no we call them ebes for extraterrestrial biological entities i said all right well that makes sense then we had a conversation and it was basically like this um i asked him why we had kept us under wraps for all these years and what did it have to do with the military and and um the whole thing and he gave me some descriptions about it said that um it since that period of time on up until you know present day that um you&#x27;re talking about the 40s to 90 yeah okay that they had been using this and uh it was all for good reasons they&#x27;ve been using what well you know i&#x27;ve never really understood that either they&#x27;ve been using the technology that the aliens gave them or they&#x27;ve been using uh the crashed uh vehicles even though he said that okay it was just sort of inference that yeah the whole thing that we recovered okay so that&#x27;s how i took it that our government was using yes for what we had recovered for for uh purposes purposes of military advantage i asked him if the president knew he said can&#x27;t go there i asked him how this might have an effect on the society and religion and basically the whole thing was people couldn&#x27;t handle it that there&#x27;d be too much shock and we&#x27;ve got to maintain this under wraps it could be disruptive to society it can be disruptive to the bible and so you know i asked him i said well you know look well you have the bible okay but it&#x27;s not like as if people aren&#x27;t gonna you know people are gonna just quit believing in jesus or anything okay come on i said no but you know this could open the door to several other things in the bible that you know we wouldn&#x27;t want and religions to to have to deal with okay it could just open a door to many things that would be so disruptive we can&#x27;t go there so you just need to keep us under wraps you&#x27;re not in trouble or anything okay and that&#x27;s it and if you you say that we had this conversation you can you know it didn&#x27;t happen so if you know what&#x27;s good for you you&#x27;re going to keep this under wraps you want to make chief don&#x27;t you i said yeah all right well let&#x27;s play ball by the rules then did you ask him when the public and the media would be allowed to know no probably never is that what he said that&#x27;s what he said probably never but that means the planet is living in a huge lie yes of course it does especially when you&#x27;re you accept that when you when you&#x27;re in the military you accept that because you&#x27;re working with secret material all the time and you understand that the united states maintains military advantage over our enemies and you accept that that that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s an okay answer for a military guy but isn&#x27;t that an incredible answer probably never that the world would be kept in the dark forever we went there and i i respectfully tried to argue with him i said yes when we recovered the aliens okay that was the 1940s that&#x27;s completely different from today this is like this is the 90s okay people would be able to handle it he said oh yeah you think so i said well could you handle it no did it scare you yeah uh would it be old news in two weeks i don&#x27;t know how does that make you feel as an american oh that&#x27;s a big question how does that make me feel as an american i i think the public should be given the truth and that&#x27;s all there is to it enough is enough um for years i&#x27;ve understood the need for secrecy but i can&#x27;t accept it no more not for this not to arrogantly and outlandishly just come right out with books and in media to say roswell didn&#x27;t happen it hurts thomas coleman shepherd was honorably discharged from active duty as e-7 chief petty officer chief yeoman united states navy november 30th 1995 after 20 years of service i look back for 37 years having no idea about any of this living a life of grace like most americans who haven&#x27;t a clue until animal mutilations crossed my path as director of special projects at the cbs station in denver in september 79 and from 79 to now in july of 2016 i know personally of dozens i don&#x27;t know any women who have served in capacities that have been dealing with extraterrestrials the men that i have been able to look at eye to eye i remember one specifically that sums up all the others not everybody has been able to survive the pressures and the punishments that they have had in their work having to do with keeping the surface life of earth ignorant about an alien presence that&#x27;s been here for at least 270 million years according to the defense intelligence agency whose planet is this what are we really if they have been making and cloning pilots that have been flying in a variety of craft and many many craft don&#x27;t need any kind of biological system they&#x27;re self-activating software they travel galaxies they don&#x27;t need anybody in them but if cloning and hybridization has been one of the big services of planet earth to at least three competing geopolitical territorial conflicting non-humans for 270 million years and we are on a planet in which one percent for at least five thousand years has wanted to keep on purpose homo sapiens sapien dumb and blind we&#x27;re dumb and blind we&#x27;re more easily manipulated and there is something so strange about 2016 it is as if as a lot of levels not just human politics but something else going on perhaps in the cosmos almost like a political argument between democrats and republicans what is allowable to do with life and there appears to be something out there that remote viewers talk about this that there really is some kind of not just milky way galaxy but other galaxies that the size of what we are in is huge vast cycles of time and if there is fairness in the big machinery of the cosmos if at the moment of death reincarnation is as the eben told one of the captains that stayed with it at los alamos for three years until it died of natural causes june 18 1952 if the soul and the recycling of the soul in and out of containers is something that the non-humans are interested in and humanity is even kept in a mythological relationship with that and that we have wars raging on this planet that are abusive and bullying and horrible is it all related to this geopolitical territorial conflict of something that is not human and has been here for so long in my own mind and in my own soul as i stand here today on july 29 2016 i have been exposed to a great deal just in the last five years about the manipulation of earth by these other intelligences that has been building inside of me a kind of i guess quiet rage for every true homo sapien sapien and we don&#x27;t even know who is homo sapien anymore because apparently everything can hide in camouflage bodies just like they make the craft invisible but for the homo sapien sapien i don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re an american a russian iraqi it seems to me that the right of homo sapiens sapiens to know the truth about what made them why they are here what continues to manipulate what continues to harvest genetic material what is doing trade routes with earth while homo sapien sapiens are completely ignorant that our right as homo sapien sapien trumps absolutely trumps government positions that denial lies in silence are the only answer from here to the end of eternity i can&#x27;t imagine that the divine field of this universe or this cosmos would allow an entire planet or other planetary systems to be so blinded and deafened by the truth of what they are that we were made by something out there that continues to interact with earth and is an alien presence it&#x27;s part of what has kept me going against tremendous pressures against me and others and i guess i&#x27;m saying these words to you because there is something that does feel so critical about this moment in time when the united states itself feels like it is cracking apart because the underbelly of so many things are so false and so phony and they are kept in place because they&#x27;re all those in power are trying to hide what i&#x27;ve shared with you today and millions of other pieces and i guess i just want to end by asking you for a show of hands how many of you feel that truth should trump for homo sapien now thank you and i really do feel that is the position of the world out of rooms like this conferences books radio television can the energy keep going forward that will crack this open for real can you believe sitting here whether you&#x27;re engineers that in 2016 with what appears now i&#x27;m getting i&#x27;m going to say some hard solid data that i can&#x27;t report yet because i can&#x27;t get the scientists scientists are terrified of losing laboratory funding today if they tread anywhere around this field and one thing for you to think about as you leave this information that i have that i would like to put bone foot meat on the bones of it but i&#x27;m just going to leave you to think about this how many are aware of ceres the dwarf planted out between the asteroid belt and mars and if you&#x27;re not aware we have a spacecraft that has been going around and is about to end its mission but it has taken extraordinary photographs of the white glowing patches but more interestingly is the uh two or four mile there&#x27;s now argument about that but a hugely tall mountain and the mountain has grooves that come down all the way around it and right next to it is a crater that if you took the mountain with the grooves and you turned it upside down it looks like they would fit and that comes from the director at uh that jpl that i&#x27;ve interviewed three times who himself in the first interview said yeah it looks like this mountain could fit into that crater we&#x27;re very puzzled and most recently i have been told off the record it is a mining operation and that one of the reasons why you have not heard or seen more about series since the first big plunge of all the news and all of the video is apparently this is now the policy of denial is now going to extend to our solar system and mars and series we can&#x27;t how can we possibly continue to live on planet earth with this schizophrenic disconnect between what the reality is in our solar system the earth and the milky way galaxy and beyond and this false phony concocted planet in which one percent for at least 5 000 years of current modern human history the one percent that controls it today controlled it five thousand years ago that one percent has to have a hidden agenda we&#x27;ve got to wake up to a whole planet and i thank you for the time and for listening and for you allowing me to be a bit uh expressive i feel that something is urgent in time that humans have to demand the truth or they&#x27;re never going to be given it and then i think earth becomes a prison planet and i don&#x27;t want that i want the truth no matter what it is with light going forward and that seems to me that&#x27;s the crossroads right now in 2016. thank you [Applause]</p>
