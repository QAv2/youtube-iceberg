            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>okay so Mick West you&#x27;ve been a UFO skeptic that&#x27;s been following the UFO stuff the last few years you have single-handedly Through Math and logic debunked several uh UFO photos and videos and you&#x27;re also the author of Escaping The Rabbit Hole history today Mick will go down in the history books as something truly incredible UFO hearings in Congress give me your initial thoughts well I was a bit disappointed I must say uh it was been built in various Arenas as being like the great Revelation that&#x27;s going to end all the speculation about about UFOs and really what we heard was very little that was new uh there were three Witnesses Dave grush uh Dave fraver and Ryan Graves and all of them have spoken before uh Graves and fraver at length for several years and they they said very little that was new uh it was a bit disappointing and you know for viewers who may not know uh David fraver&#x27;s story was we first heard of his story in December 2017 uh and his story has gotten a lot of coverage documentaries movies made about his story over the last six years and again Congress pulls him in and he tells the same story uh Ryan Graves we&#x27;ve heard his story since I believe 2019 and we again and documentaries made about his story tons of media coverage on his story he&#x27;s brought in where he tells the same story Dave grush who was you know did a huge interview on news nation and spilled the beans about aliens uh comes in and and again offered nothing new the big headline is nothing new well let&#x27;s talk about evidence because that&#x27;s been the main thing that&#x27;s been lacking the last six years is a lot of stories a lot of photos with stories behind them a lot of videos with stories behind them but it&#x27;s really been lacking on evidence of non-human intelligence of aliens of extraterrestrials so it all led up to today today&#x27;s hearing there were a lot of expectations for evidence did you see were you convinced was any evidence presented there was almost no new evidence uh Professor Avi Loeb was running the Galileo project which is a scientific project to look for uh UFOs basically in our airspace so a couple of days ago we need real evidence not what people said and really all we&#x27;ve got from these hearings is what people said uh Dave David grush is basically is going by mostly what people told him and then we have these these eyewitness accounts of uh of favor and Graves and then they tell us that there are there&#x27;s more information we need to get to that real evidence you could tell I&#x27;m uh that some of these Congressional leaders were attending their UFOs 101 class uh and I think a lot of people are disappointed they thought Congress was on this the last few years that they&#x27;d been digging getting you know classified data and evidence and information and all this stuff and that we&#x27;d be further along than just the very very very Basics at this point but let&#x27;s talk about the witnesses so the big thing today was you know Congress uh hand-picked uh three witnesses to come and testify and share what they knew about a UAP and what they felt should be done and so let&#x27;s start with Ryan Graves Ryan Graves is a you know former F-18 pilot who whose Squadron observed unidentified objects or at least on their sensors observed off the east coast in a training area which I believe is a big clue in a military training area uh would constantly observe per Graves these objects that seem to be doing weird things things like hovering in place despite wind with no visible propulsion what are your insights and opinions on Ryan Graves as a witness and Ryan graves&#x27;s testimony of UAP off the east coast well you know Ryan Graves never actually saw a UAP uh this is something I think that gets conflicted and people don&#x27;t really understand what they&#x27;re talking about and when he talks about saying we saw these things every day for two years what he&#x27;s talking about is is blips on the radar what happened was that they uh they upgraded their radar system they previously had a kind of an old-fashioned radar that had this little dish that points around in the nose of the plane and the upgraded to this kind of flat panel one which is much more sensitive and easier to direct in different different directions and after they replaced this radar with the newer radar they started seeing these blips on the radar and they originally thought that there was something wrong with the radar now it may just be and this is the perhaps the leading hypothesis for what&#x27;s actually going on there is that the majority of those things were balloons and we know that the military does have a big issue with uh mylar balloons and in the most recent uh uh report uh by Arrow they said that nearly half of the ones that they identified were actually balloons so definitely a balloons are a problem so the question is like is there actually strong evidence of something amazing going on it can&#x27;t be overstated that Graves is on the record saying he personally never saw one of these objects and I believe what he means even though it&#x27;s completely murky still and I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s never cleared up or asked about is he never physically saw with his own eyes any of these objects ever it was always a squad Squadron member saw them or I know someone who saw them or Etc is where the majority of this testimony comes from and that&#x27;s been his story for years and so I why weren&#x27;t any of those people yeah exactly people who actually saw them why weren&#x27;t the people who actually saw these things called before Congress yeah and I think if we can&#x27;t get the real evidence in terms of recordings and data and radar and things like that the next specs best thing would be the first-hand witnesses another thing with that I didn&#x27;t really hear brought up today in today&#x27;s hearing few mentions of the Chinese spy balloon but nobody really mentions a lot of the news that has come out based on Navy documentation and uh vast reporting that a lot of these objects that were described off the east coast at graves described the only object that was eyes on that people saw with their eyes was a round object with a cube inside of it 10 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach two F-18 Super Hornets were split by UAP the object described as a dark gray or a black Cube inside of a clear sphere came within 50 feet of the lead aircraft if you look in human-made history if you look at what humans have made in the military humans have made clear transparent orbs with cubes inside of them these are our radar reflectors radar jammers or whatever and there&#x27;s a cube within a sphere so humans have made something that looks like that it goes into the air it has a process and then you learn that after the Chinese spy balloon there was further reporting that there were smaller balloons had been for a while smaller Chinese balloons off the east coast in this exact area that were radar jamming balloons so you&#x27;ve got historical precedent you&#x27;ve got you know objects that were made by humans that look like what was described and then you learn things that China had smaller spy balloons off the east coast in this exact area and then now how we learned that China had a has had a spy Base in Cuba for decades if you believe the reports for decades down there what have they been flying out of there none of that was brought up today none of that was even considered today at all I would have been great if they kind of like kind of discuss the range of possibilities that we might be looking at but it&#x27;s possible that you know some of that that they weren&#x27;t even familiar with it because it&#x27;s like kind of the unsexy aspect of what we&#x27;re talking about it&#x27;s not aliens it&#x27;s just Chinese spibalisms which is obviously a big issue in itself uh but you know the people who are promoting this hearing you know perhaps want to promote the alien aspect rather than the uh the Chinese aspects and it may be also something that they&#x27;ve been asked not to talk about because it&#x27;s something that would reveal our capabilities and in detecting these particular things and that might in fact be something that explains why no real election was taken on the the cases that grave was discussing if it was something that was thought to be an enemy thing like the the you wouldn&#x27;t actually see the action that is being taken there would be action but it would be top secret and Graves himself wouldn&#x27;t actually know about it the pilots wouldn&#x27;t know about what was being done in terms of counter measures I think that probably most of what they were seeing on the East Coast was just normal Airborne clutter but it&#x27;s certainly possible that some of that might be uh you know Chinese balloons or drones trying to test out our airspace let&#x27;s move on to David grush David Rush made headlines two months ago going on news nation which has become America&#x27;s UFO Channel with a jaw-dropping story and allegations that the US government has recovered has a top secret Uber secret team that recovers crashed non-human UFOs that non-human intelligence bodies were inside these UFOs that people have been killed uh to keep it a secret that the aliens themselves have been killing humans a whole bunch of stuff and so he was you know dead center in the in today&#x27;s hearing what did you think of his uh testimony and what he had to say yeah I mean this whole hearing I think was triggered by by his uh his initial claims uh and really people did want to hear what he had to say I wanted to hear what he had to say but he didn&#x27;t say anything new that I can really think of that was actually significant uh he basically repeated some of the same claims uh perhaps in in less detail than he had before but in nearly every interesting question like he would people he was asked things like uh have we made contact with with aliens and you say he would say that he can&#x27;t talk about this you can talk about it in a secure setting I can&#x27;t discuss that in an open session over and over again that was that was his answer I do know a lot of that information but that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t discuss publicly I can&#x27;t discuss that publicly once again I can&#x27;t discuss that publicly so it was very disappointing I really the it was originally built I think as being this great hearing where we would have all these Witnesses coming forward the people that David gresh had talked to or told him these things were going to be subpoenaed and brought in and they would tell us all about the you know where the bodies were and which hanger uh these these flying sources are in and where&#x27;s this giant one that&#x27;s in uh another country or somewhere but we didn&#x27;t we just got David grush himself and these two other Pilots that we&#x27;ve been hearing from for years and then David grush just repeats essentially everything that um he&#x27;d said before and say is there anything else I&#x27;m going to have to tell you in a secure setting so it kind of kicked the can down the road and yeah as this tradition here indeed indeed he States this in his opening statement and reiterates this because he&#x27;s asked about it is he didn&#x27;t physically firsthand see any of this stuff uh he says in his statement that a lot of this information was given to him through second third parties and uh he considers those people to be legitimate and so he considers what they have to say to be real um and no names were named he wasn&#x27;t really asked to name any names uh for the most part uh so we it&#x27;s still this big question mark and as you said it&#x27;s disappointing because we thought these answers were coming today they didn&#x27;t come today get the people who saw the alien bodies in the seats with their hand raised saying I swear you know get those people this was it just seemed um like a a missed opportunity another thing that struck me was there were basically no critical questions asked from congressional leaders there were no digging insightful real questions um did you get that impression as well yeah but I think that&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t really understand the situation yeah we saw from the the people that running the the show burchett and Luna they didn&#x27;t really you know have a good grasp on the details and the other people there A lot of them seem to be learning about it for the first time uh and whenever you get to a question that was actually kind of getting to the meat of the matter uh grush would just say that he couldn&#x27;t answer that question so even when we did have some some skeptical questions I think from Eric Burleson had a few uh he wasn&#x27;t able to get in the answers everyone&#x27;s heard the Tic Tac story or at least they think they&#x27;ve heard the Tic Tac story and they know the basics but but the key thing is this and no one asks about this no one knows about this and it seems like the media and Congress just don&#x27;t care um is that he says and he reiterated today Mick that his encounter with the Tic Tac was five minutes a five five minute encounter what we saw with four sets of eyes over a five minute period still there&#x27;s nothing we have nothing close to it it was it was amazing to see the pilot of the plane next to him was Alex Dietrich Alex Dietrich was flying is his wing person essentially she says it the whole thing lasted 10 seconds her testimony is that it lasted 10 seconds and she scoffs at the idea of it being five minutes and that that&#x27;s just silly and so you&#x27;ve got two witnesses basically right there in the same area and they can&#x27;t one says it lasted five minutes one says it lasted 10 seconds that&#x27;s a huge discrepancy where the two main Witnesses can&#x27;t even agree on the basics about this Tic Tac encounter but it&#x27;s never brought up as it never asked about no it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of hand waved away again he said oh maybe it&#x27;s just like a misunderstanding or time dilation or something like that but it but you can&#x27;t really hand wave away a 10 seconds versus five minutes a lot of folks today Burchette fraver uh Graves uh mentioned it a few others mentioned it that the Genesis of either their personal interest or the general interest in the public and Congress goes back to the 2017 New York Times front page article on the pentagon&#x27;s UFO program atip multiple times this was brought up today a groundbreaking 2017 New York Times report 2017 uh New York Times Like many others in 2017 I saw the New York Times article from New York Times article and I would encourage everybody to read that and that was just shocking to me because through my reporting we&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve demonstrated that that article was factually inaccurate you know deceptive that story is mostly false and and wrong and to hear Congressional leaders Witnesses everyone still saying it all goes back to this article uh it shows that shows me that people still haven&#x27;t caught up to what&#x27;s going going on really going on in the story people just don&#x27;t know the facts the basic facts about what&#x27;s going on uh were you shocked to hear do you continue to be shocked to hear about the 2017 New York Times no I unfortunately not because it&#x27;s something that just comes up all the time as being you know essentially like a red pill moment for people uh it was for grush himself like he he got interested in UFOs starting with that particular thing and so many people have told me that you know that was you know their introduction uh to to what was going on you know they they read the New York Times story and so they get they get sucked in because of that and this New York Times story is just given it the kind of authority of you know the New York Times said this the program was Skinwalker Ranch it was all sap it was Robert Bigelow and people chasing Dino beavers and werewolves and Leslie Kane a UFO activist took the story threw oursap away through skin walker away and made it just about UFOs which is which got the to her Reddit got the attention of Congress the the the problem being most of the story was wrong and that&#x27;s not an opinion it&#x27;s wrong the story is absolutely a wrong false story and we heard today Congressional leaders and the witnesses saying that article continues to be their inspiration it continues to push the issue further in Congress and none of them are aware of the fact that the story is riddled with you know unimpeachable errors the public isn&#x27;t aware of this the media isn&#x27;t aware of this and I guarantee you Congress isn&#x27;t aware of this but David gresh is without a doubt linked to Skinwalker Ranch Ghost Hunters uh Jay Stratton dates back to 2007 at least uh when it comes to interest in Skinwalker Ranch Stratton who was Russia&#x27;s boss at the UAP task force claims that he&#x27;s haunted by ghosts and werewolves and believes in this kind of weird multi-dimensional pseudo-sychic kind of reality to this phenomena grush is linked to Eric Davis who in three just three years ago almost word for word claimed the exact same thing that gresh is claiming to the New York Times you could go read the New York Times right now Eric Davis says off-world Vehicles not from this Earth the government&#x27;s retrieving the crashes all this stuff Eric Davis is a long time Skinwalker Ranch Ghost Hunter claims ghost spoke to him telepathically it&#x27;s still I don&#x27;t think Congress even knows I don&#x27;t think they know that a skin that Skinwalker Ghost Hunters were in charge of the pentagon&#x27;s UAP task force for years I don&#x27;t think they realize this I don&#x27;t think they even know about this yet no I don&#x27;t I agree and it&#x27;s probably something the Pentagon is a little bit uh embarrassed about so yeah yeah I&#x27;m sure if you ask Patrick about it he&#x27;ll he&#x27;ll roll his eyes because it&#x27;s kind of the pain of his existence that this he&#x27;s got this kind of legacy of uh uh poor investigation that went before him right but yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very much a real thing and it continues to be with Travis Taylor and and Stratton working on Skinwalker Ranch now which is just so bizarre and there&#x27;s a photo of grush at a UFO conference from last year he&#x27;s sitting at a table with George Knapp with Jay Stratton with Travis Taylor those three other guys that I mentioned deeply involved with skin walker Ranch deeply involved with dubious claims of just the craziest stuff ever have never presented any evidence but none of this context was brought up looked into thought of as relevant perhaps I mean we heard Jay stratton&#x27;s name but almost just kind of like a throwaway um today why wasn&#x27;t Jay Stratton there he was in charge of the UAP task force he was the guy asking David grush to go do these things he was the boss why I mean he&#x27;s retired he&#x27;s appearing on History Channel shows just call him to Washington DC were you surprised to not see people like Jay Stratton Lou Elizondo there not yeah I mean I I Jay strassen would have been one of my number one picks uh to be there because he was the head of the UAP test Force he was for a while a grush&#x27;s boss he had title 50 and title 10 clearance which meant he could ask anybody anything and make them tell him things he would have been able to get the exact same information and probably more information because he was more senior than grush and so he he&#x27;s someone who probably knows uh about these claims and about you know the the weather the hangars are that have these these crafting allegedly uh but yeah he wasn&#x27;t called and uh it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a bit strange I mean why is that I mean you bring up skin walker Ranch you know he he appears on the Skinwalker Ranch TV show now it&#x27;s this very weird thing because you know as you know like going back to the the 90s uh skinwalk around is kind of the root of a lot of what we&#x27;re seeing right now Skinwalker Ranch was this haunted Ranch that&#x27;s uh inspired the creation of the OSAP program by by Harry Reid back then hey you&#x27;re stealing my lines those are my lines Nick you&#x27;re the expert here you&#x27;ve got this wonderful series of videos explaining it to people which you know I recommend everybody watch but you know part of the problem there is that in people&#x27;s eyes glaze over when you start talking about it yeah and you mentioned it you mentioned it the other night to Chris I saw it you were like you were like hey a lot of this is linked to Skinwalker Ranch and alsap and Chris Cuomo was like yeah and it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not just because it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s unfamiliar to them it&#x27;s that when you start looking into it it&#x27;s like oh that can&#x27;t be real yeah this is obviously nonsense but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s true it&#x27;s not true in the sense that there&#x27;s there&#x27;s actual werewolves but it&#x27;s true that these people believed it and it&#x27;s true that the foundation of orsap is actually Skinwalker Ranch and ghosts and things like that right and that reverberates to this day right and it&#x27;s such when you have the context when you&#x27;re informed when if the public had the context of here&#x27;s what the Skinwalker Ranch investigators like Stratton like Davis believe in non-human intelligence multi-dimensional beings traveling in between Dimensions spacecraft that but not just that but UFOs that are linked to ghosts and that they&#x27;re coming out of portals and all of these things and then when you listen to what grush is claiming and that he&#x27;s heard this from certain people and that you know that these some of these certain people are Skinwalker people all of that begins to click oh okay I kind of see what&#x27;s happening here but the fact that that&#x27;s not looked into brought up or asked about at all at this point is is pretty silly and perhaps you have a point that it just sounds so ridiculous that it&#x27;s outright outright you know denied yeah I think it&#x27;s difficult for people to bring up to their colleagues in Congress because you know you start talking to somebody about Skinwalker Ranch and how these people believed in ghosts uh they&#x27;re gonna look at you kind of weird so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s this it&#x27;s almost like the the topic has immunized itself against scrutiny by being too ridiculous to be scrutinized yeah dude I couldn&#x27;t said it better that&#x27;s actually really good I&#x27;m gonna write that down and and I&#x27;m gonna say that I said it foreign</p>
