            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>If you&#x27;ve been watching the show for some time, you&#x27;ll know how just extensively we cover all things UFO or UAP as the government now calls it. This show was the first to interview whistleblower David Grush and he was a former Air Force officer who came forward to claim that the government had secretly recovered alien technology. That was two years ago. And now what was then crazy has become something of a unifying topic for lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to the point where a brand new documentary is being released today about all the things UAP uh all things UAP and it&#x27;s all featuring officials from the very highest levels of the US government. The documentary is called The Age of Disclosure, and it tells the story of an 80year global coverup, concealing the existence of intelligent alien life and technology.</p>
<p>Tonight, we bring you an exclusive clip. &gt;&gt; We learned that the US government was involved in a longunning secret war with other nations to collect and reverse engineer vehicles not made by humans. Some people claim it would cost them their lives if they spoke out about these things. &gt;&gt; The first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to the Manhattan project.</p>
<p>This is the atomic weapon on steroids. If Xi Jinping had access to this, if Putin had access, you think for a second that they wouldn&#x27;t consider using it to achieve their ends of domination? sometimes strategic surprises that change the course of human history. &gt;&gt; Dan Farah is the documentary&#x27;s director and producer and he joins me now. All right, Dan, I was up way too late watching this entire thing because I literally couldn&#x27;t stop. Congratulations.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fantastic. &gt;&gt; I was struck by this line from one of the people you interviewed. Without a doubt, there has never been a program before that has been so successfully kept out of the public eye as the legacy crash retrieval program. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; One of the intelligence officials in the film makes that statement. And you know, previously the most secretive program was the Manhattan Project, but we found out in hindsight that the Manhattan Project had leaks.</p>
<p>So when this program was created, they made it even more secretive and put more security measures in place. And those security measures have ruled the day the last 80 years. &gt;&gt; The legacy crash retrieval program was is something that the Air Force does for the most part. They have special units that go out to collect to retrieve alien spacecraft that have crashed. &gt;&gt; Well, the people in my film reveal that the elements of this program are elements of the Air Force, elements of the CIA, elements of the Department of Energy, and military defense contractors.</p>
<p>All right. For decades, uh, they&#x27;ve had these units that go out, and we&#x27;re not the only ones with these units that are going out to retrieve the stuff. Russia and China are, too. That&#x27;s the other amazing thing that you reveal in the film, which is that we&#x27;re in a secret arms race. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>It It&#x27;s arguably the most shocking of the reveals that there is this highstake secret cold war race to reverse engineer technology of non-human origin that the United States is involved in with adversarial nations like China and Russia. We think China and Russia both have retrieved alien spacecraft as well. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s what the officials in my film go on the record stating &gt;&gt; they go on the record in fact saying that what what in 1989 we think the Soviets retrieved a tic tacshaped spacecraft that had crashed &gt;&gt; which was which was significantly larger than the tic tac encountered by the Nimttz carrier strike group and you know commander Dave Fraver who pursued it. You also have two different astrophysicists in the documentary who say the the government has retrieved at least two different alien species and that one of them made contact with the crash retrieval team. What does that mean? Does that mean it was alive when they captured it? &gt;&gt; One of the int one of the intelligence officials in the film speaks about an event that happened on a US military base where a where two UAP approached the base.</p>
<p>one of them landed and apparently non-human beings exited the craft and interacted with members of the Air Force and the CIA. Um, now here&#x27;s the thing. These are all these all sound like extraordinary claims that are hard for people to wrap their head around, right? But these are 34 in my film. There&#x27;s 34 extremely high level military, government, intelligence officials, people who have been trusted with very high level security clearances, people who have been involved in, you know, keeping this nation safe in many different ways. and people who we&#x27;ve trust we trust in a lot of scenarios.</p>
<p>And you know, these interview subjects range from our secretary of state to sitting senators to former, you know, uh uh director of national intelligence, former secretary of defense, &gt;&gt; um leaders from the Pentagon, leaders from the CIA, leaders from the Air Force, leaders from the the Navy. I mean, the list goes on and on. It&#x27;s really hard to ignore what these people are saying. It&#x27;s really hard to say this is one kooky person doing this when you have this much experience &gt;&gt; in every level and every branch of government all coming together on camera to say not only have we retrieved alien spacecraft we&#x27;ve retrieved alien remains. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And and keep in mind these are people that are not aligned at all ideologically or politically, right? But they&#x27;re aligned on this. So, it&#x27;s 34 senior officials sharing one truth. &gt;&gt; During this was uh something that I did not know was that during the second Bush presidency, Bush 2, they actually contemplated they convened a cabinet meeting and debated and discussed for days about whether or not to finally go public with this program with what they have found and what they have discovered. So Bush too had learned the base facts that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe and that there have been recoveries of technology of non-human origin and he was contemplating whether to share that with the world during his presidency and he put together a think tank. One of the officials in my film was part of that think tank and he goes on the record about it.</p>
<p>They were asked to analyze the impact to various aspects of our society from religion to the economy and they all went into it bullish on the idea of disclosure and after evaluating it they all decided it was a bad idea. Why? &gt;&gt; For various reasons, just the impact, the place we were as a country following, you know, 9/11, um they just didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea. They thought that we weren&#x27;t ready for it, right? &gt;&gt; The film also reveals that in Trump&#x27;s first administration, he had he contemplated going public in a similar way. Uh, one of the officials in my film, high level intelligence official, goes on record saying that Secretary Minutian reached out to him and asked him for a high level briefing on this topic because he wanted to know what the economic, you know, repercussions might be. &gt;&gt; No, I love that part of because he says, &quot;Do you want to know why I&#x27;m asking you?&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;Why?&quot; He said, &quot;Because I want to I need to figure out what&#x27;s going to happen to our economy if we come out as a government and say aliens exist.</p>
<p>aliens are here and we have them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And obviously they made the same decision Bush too did which was &gt;&gt; to not go public to to keep it to keep it internal to the people who know. &gt;&gt; There was one part of the documentary I wanted more information on.</p>
<p>You interview a former military analyst who said that he and others who had interactions with the UAPs are now suffering physical effects. What interactions did they have? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, one of the um to be honest not so shocking reveals is that intelligence officials who have had encounters with UAP end up having biological effects. And I say not surprising because this is technology that we don&#x27;t understand fully that you know is emitting a lot of energy and in the same way that if you stand behind the back of a you know &gt;&gt; so he came close to &gt;&gt; jet you&#x27;re going to get hurt. He came close to one of these &gt;&gt; came came close came close close to multiple UAP and ended up having biological effects &gt;&gt; and yet because so much of this information is classified there we can&#x27;t none of them can go on camera and say what they saw specifically.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Not specifically. So look the reality of it is for 80 years all of this has been kept from the public, Congress and even sitting presidents. And I think that that really changes today when this movie comes out and the public learns the truth finally. And my hope is it sets the stage for the president finally stepping up and telling the world the base facts that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe and what what he knows is going on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; At the very least, he&#x27;ll convene maybe a cabinet meeting in which, you know, then they&#x27;ll all say, you know, would it be? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t know. I think the world is more prepared for this. &gt;&gt; I think we&#x27;re ready for it. I think that the people can handle the truth. &gt;&gt; Uh, okay.</p>
<p>Last question. You point out in the documentary, I found this very, very intriguing, but you point out that we as humans have only mapped about 27% of Earth&#x27;s oceans. We know more about the surface of the moon and the surface of Mars than we do about our own oceans. And you have several of these astrophysicists and and and intelligence officials saying, &quot;You know what? It&#x27;s possible these objects, these UAPs, UFOs, whatever you want to call them, aren&#x27;t coming from outer space. They might be coming from the ocean.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, look, moreover, we have, you know, senior members of the House Intelligence Committee going on record saying that the craft seen coming out of the ocean are otherworldly things. They straight up say on camera, &quot;These are not rockets. They&#x27;re not aircraft. moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater conceivable defying physics as we know it. And then retired Admiral Galedet who was the chief oceanographer of the United States Navy.</p>
<p>He is the one who states, you know, that fact you just shared and that he makes the point of if you were an intelligent species from somewhere else and you wanted to hide from humanity, the most obvious place would be our oceans, &gt;&gt; right? That&#x27;s where you got to hide. Wow. It&#x27;s a fascinating documentary. It&#x27;s on Amazon Prime Video uh starting tonight. It&#x27;s also in theaters.</p>
<p>Dan, congratulations. It&#x27;s called The Age of &gt;&gt; The Age of Disclosure. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I almost said innocence. I was like, you can tell I&#x27;ve got Friday brain. &gt;&gt; Prime Video Worldwide theaters New York, Los Angeles, and DC.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s really, really great. Congrats. Great. &gt;&gt; I appreciate it. Didn&#x27;t end there.</p>
<p>Joining me now is someone who appears in the age of disclosure. Lou Alzando was a former Pentagon official. He&#x27;s also executive producer of the documentary. Lou, welcome back to the show. Um, thank you for &gt;&gt; I just got to ask you first about what I was talking to Dan Far about.</p>
<p>Two different alien species. Can you tell me anything about them? Well, what you&#x27;re referring to was the alleged potential landing of Hollowman Air Force Base back in the 1950s where a a vehicle, a craft of unknown origin had uh had landed at the edge of the airfield and uh and initiated contact with individuals from both the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Air Force. And if that&#x27;s the case, think of what the uh think of the the consequences of that, right? That means that somewhere someone had maybe perhaps pre-coordinated or arranged or was aware of &gt;&gt; of uh this potential landing enough so that individuals on the base were actually alerted and prepared for and waiting for uh these uh these craft. Right? So that that kind of gives you an idea that perhaps there was some sort of dialogue or some sort of communication perhaps even before that uh that event took place. That was not something that you have firsthand knowledge about.</p>
<p>You weren&#x27;t there. What do you What do you have firstirhand knowledge about? &gt;&gt; Well, boy, how much time do you have, Elizabeth? Um, &gt;&gt; we&#x27;ve got about seven minutes. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay, so uh as as you may know, I uh I ran the government&#x27;s program at the Pentagon roughly from around 2010 called ATIP uh to about 2017 when I resigned in protest. ATIP is the program that is in charge of studying alien spacecraft &gt;&gt; and reverse engineering. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Correct. Despite Well, not exactly. It was the Pentagon&#x27;s investigation into UFOs or what we now call UAP. Uh and uh it was replaced later by an organization that was called the UAP Task Force, which by the way, one of those individuals, a leader of that was also in our documentary. He&#x27;s also an executive producer, Jay Stratton.</p>
<p>And then later on, Arrow uh replaced uh replaced that organization. So, there&#x27;s been a long a lot of people are surprised to learn that the Pentagon a studied UFOs, but B continues to study UFOs and has for a very, very long time. &gt;&gt; We know from the documentary uh that they&#x27;re not just studying UFOs. You say we&#x27;re trying to reverse engineer from the spacecraft that we have found. um use that technology and that we&#x27;re in a secret sort of arms race with Russia and China who both also have alien spaceships.</p>
<p>The documentary reports that the Soviets found a big one back in 1989. Do we know when the Chinese found one? And how do we know that anyway? &gt;&gt; Sure. Well, let me give you some more compelling information here perhaps uh that you may not be aware of. Just recently, there was another hearing on the Hill under oath. And one of the individuals to testify under oath was a journalist named George Knap.</p>
<p>George Knap uh testified that back in the early 90s, right when the Berlin Wall came down, there was this brief period of cooperation between then Soviet, former Soviet Union, the United States. And he received a handful of classified, very classified documents from Russian generals about their UFO program and the reverse engineering program. and he actually successfully smuggled them out of Russia and brought them here to the United States. Um so there there&#x27;s a lot of information suggesting and that that both Russia and other adversaries have their own UAP program. And in fact, China has already admitted it uh publicly um in a newspaper that they have their own UFO program and have been petitioning the United Nations in order to to help lead a a worldwide investigation.</p>
<p>Now, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m comfortable with China necessarily doing that, but it shows the the level of eagerness um that some of our adversaries are displaying towards towards this topic of UAP. Remember, this is a topic that for a long time was really fraught with stigma and taboo. &gt;&gt; And I think only now uh we&#x27;re beginning to get to the point where within the American psyche, we can actually have a serious conversation and not think about, you know, little green men or or Elvis on the mother or tin tinfoil hats. So there there was another object. There&#x27;s two objects that I&#x27;m here to talk about.</p>
<p>One was the egg. The other is what we called an eight gone. The eight gone was a uh essentially a flying disc with what looked like eight uh delineated sections when looking down. And I can tell you what it looked like from looking down because that&#x27;s primarily how I saw it because I&#x27;m a helicopter pilot. Um we did recoveries with the eight guns.</p>
<p>There was more than one that was that made its way to the ground on this particular operation. &gt;&gt; Simply seeing a nonhuman craft up close would be an intense experience in itself. But Barber says as he prepared to transport that so-called 8gon from the pickup site to the drop site, something even more intense happened to him that would change his life forever. This is [music] one of the most profound experiences I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. I&#x27;m about to share with you.</p>
<p>So bear with me. So as I get closer to this pixight, I start feeling odd. I start feeling extremely emotional. Um, and the closer I get, the more the emotion [music] starts to overwhelm me. I feel this [music] intense hybrid of sadness and happiness and beauty um and song.</p>
<p>And it was very disruptive to me cuz I had a very practical responsibility at the time to operate a helicopter in the mountains at night. And I began wondering what was wrong with me. It was late. I&#x27;m like, am I distressed? Am I tired? And I don&#x27;t know. Um, but as I came over this object for the pick, there was this overwhelming sense of emotion.</p>
<p>Is it your feeling? Are you suddenly having an internal breakdown on a job? &gt;&gt; No. I felt like something connected with me. I felt like something had tuned in to me and my soul and was providing me some sense of guidance on what to do and how profound what I was doing was. Um, and it was so overwhelming that I began to cry. And then I&#x27;m confused as to why I&#x27;m crying at the same time.</p>
<p>And then I&#x27;m do I abort the mission? do I? And I So I just did my best to focus on my particular cues when doing this type of work. And I got the load hooked up and I began flying away. And once it was just me and that object in between the pick and the drop site, there&#x27;s about 20 mi in between. I felt like something was inside of me. I felt like I was possessed by the most beautiful spirit I&#x27;d ever been possessed by.</p>
<p>And was it loving? &gt;&gt; It was loving. [snorts] Um, but there was a sense of sadness at the same time. And um, &gt;&gt; had you ever had an experience like [music] this before? &gt;&gt; No. No. It was a very feminine energy.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you that. I It felt like felt like the spirit of God, but not in [music] any masculine sense. And it wasn&#x27;t like a soul. It was like a frequency that I [music] was connected with. And whatever that force was since that night, it has stayed with me.</p>
<p>[music] And as crazy as this sounds, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s guiding me now. And it&#x27;s what&#x27;s providing protection for me. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s changed your life. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s changed my life. &gt;&gt; Wait a second.</p>
<p>Humans bonding psychically and emotionally with nonhuman intelligence. Yes. Jake Barber says that&#x27;s exactly what happened to him. And he&#x27;s not the only one. And [music] he says the government knows all about it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There is a psychic component to the research [music] and development of the UAP program. I want to bring in three eyewitnesses to these unexplained phenomena. Uh and they&#x27;re not just any witnesses, but three names that we all know very well. People that I know well and trust and are my friends. NewsNation correspondent Rich McHugh happened to be with New Jersey police last night out doing the job when he spotted the drones.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got Dr. Katherine Ramsland, forensic psychologist. This woman doesn&#x27;t lie. She writes the books, by the way. She saw the drones two nights in a row.</p>
<p>Uh she&#x27;s known here for taking us inside the mind of serial killers. She saw half a dozen drones in Pennsylvania. I also want to welcome Scott Rouse, our go-to behavioral and body language expert. I know Scott well. He tells the truth.</p>
<p>He saw the drones over Tennessee. I mean, if look at these three have all seen him. What is going on? I want to start with Rich McHugh, though, because Rich, uh, you were out on the story last night. Didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Uh, and take it from there.</p>
<p>I mean, what happened? Off the top, I&#x27;ve been skeptical of this story. As a resident of New Jersey, as a journalist here, I thought it was going to be some sort of yahoos. Uh, and we would get a laugh out of this in several weeks. What happened yesterday completely changed my my entire view on this story. Uh, earlier in the in the afternoon, I was out with the Ocean City uh sheriff&#x27;s department.</p>
<p>They have a drone unit. They&#x27;ve investigated these things. What they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve saw a bunch over the weekend. We did not see any with them last night. I was coming back home.</p>
<p>I got a tip. Monmouth County. They&#x27;re spotting them in Monmouth County. That&#x27;s where I live. So, I raced up here and I tried to figure out where the picture was that somebody sent me.</p>
<p>[snorts] And sure enough, I saw one. So, I tra I trailed it to a neighborhood uh a dead end street and I got out of my car and I took my phone out with, you know, my iPhone and I couldn&#x27;t really capture it, but I was staring literally at this drone 200 feet above me maybe. I called [snorts] our photographer, Nick, and I said, &quot;Get up here as soon as you possibly can. Meet me at this location, etc.&quot; Uh, I tracked a few more to the location where we are right now over a body of water behind us. And I got to say, Brian, over the next two hours, we saw dozens and dozens of these things.</p>
<p>And they look like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before. I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;m right in calling them a drone. you know, they were they looked like they were fixed wing aircraft. They had multiple, you know, blinking lights. They did not look anything like like a plane because there&#x27;s plenty of planes flying overhead.</p>
<p>Like tonight, they&#x27;re not here. We&#x27;re we&#x27;re seeing just planes. Last night was totally different. They look creepy and they move at a different pace. We tried to even follow a couple.</p>
<p>They went off in the distance and disappeared. Uh it&#x27;s completely rewired my brain on this topic and I&#x27;m I am a believer and we need answers. Uh and we don&#x27;t have uh we don&#x27;t have answers and we we need someone to step up and say here is what&#x27;s going on. Um cuz otherwise like we&#x27;re heading down this path in New Jersey and these states where uh people are just going to take this into their own hands. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m looking at your video right now. We have it in the middle of the screen. I know it&#x27;s tough at night um when you&#x27;re using your iPhone and it&#x27;s pitch black. You said you were near the water, but so it it&#x27;s kind of hard to see. Uh, but you know, we&#x27;ve heard these reports from people, but hearing it from you, Rich, as our investigative reporter, knowing you, knowing the kind of work you do, it is kind of freaky to hear you say that it um that that you couldn&#x27;t identify it.</p>
<p>Describe it a little more. I mean, how big and you know, when I think of a drone, you think of like the you know, it&#x27;s got the four It&#x27;s almost like a little helicopter with the four rotors. Are these not do these look different than that? &gt;&gt; They look different. They almost look like like a a U-shaped or a V-shaped. Uh they didn&#x27;t make a sound.</p>
<p>It was, you know, couple hundred feet above us. They um you just didn&#x27;t know what you were looking at. It was moving across the sky very quietly. And we were we kept saying to each other like Nick and I like, &quot;What are we looking at?&quot; Like, &quot;Are you getting the shot? And what the heck are we filming? Um, there&#x27;s a couple shots you can see where you can see that it&#x27;s fixed wing and it doesn&#x27;t look like a plane. It almost looks like inverted.</p>
<p>Um, it sounds crazy as I say this now, Brian. Like that that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing on the screen. That&#x27;s what we were seeing right above our heads and it happened till about 11:30 at night and then it started to like die off and I was like, we can stay out here all night. But I went to bed. This is my community.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never seen these things in the sky over my community before. I went to bed thinking like this is wild. These things are flying over our over our homes, over our residences. There&#x27;s a military Earl, which is a munitions depot just like about a mile and a half behind me. They&#x27;ve reported sightings of these things above and they said they&#x27;re ready to take action if they need to.</p>
<p>This is um for for naysayers out there, like this is real. So, how many did you see at once, Rich? Was it just the one or? &gt;&gt; Well, no. [snorts] I think we saw we would see a couple at a time in various parts of of the sky over this water. And we&#x27;d be like, &quot;Oh, we didn&#x27;t get this shot on that one.&quot; And they&#x27;d be like, &quot;Well, wait. We&#x27;ll just wait.&quot; You know, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;ll be another one.</p>
<p>And sure enough, like the one started creeping towards us. And it&#x27;s like it felt like I was in a bad sci-fi movie. like that. It was just that I was placed in, but it involved my my actual hometown. It was very, very surreal.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, to hear you saying this again, it just sort of hits me in a different way coming from you. Um, wow. I want to go to Dr. Ramsland now. Uh, Dr.</p>
<p>Ramslland lives in Pennsylvania. If you ever told me that I would be asking Dr. Ramslland about drones flying near her home, we usually talk to her about killers. Um, I wasn&#x27;t expecting this, but they said Dr. Ramsson seeing the drones.</p>
<p>What did What did you see? &gt;&gt; A similar experience uh tonight actually. Well, it started last night. We were hearing about them in New Jersey and suddenly we&#x27;re in Eastern Pennsylvania. It&#x27;s as if they migrated over. I called a couple of friends and we were texting each other as we were each all of us seeing them in different areas.</p>
<p>And the one tonight I saw one going west. It was red red blinking lights like this one. Another one was coming toward it from the west going east and then and then the westward one suddenly turned around and went into formation with the one going east turned green. The lights turned green and then yellow and it looked very much like the what we&#x27;re seeing here in the in these pictures. &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen anything like it, Dr.</p>
<p>Ramslin? And are you sure it wasn&#x27;t a plane? It it couldn&#x27;t possibly be a plane. It was flying low. It was within half a mile of me. Um there there&#x27;s no plane path at that point. And it didn&#x27;t act like a plane.</p>
<p>It a plane can&#x27;t turn that fast. And and it also had oddly spiral kinds of movements that you you just don&#x27;t see with a plane. &gt;&gt; And so it was last night. &gt;&gt; There was no noise. Again, no noise.</p>
<p>Yeah. &gt;&gt; So last night and again tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. same same look of of drone. I mean, did it look the same? &gt;&gt; I could see them more clearly tonight and I think it&#x27;s because it is a very clear night.</p>
<p>I saw them really distinctly and there were more of them tonight according to my two friends again got out and and we all could see more tonight. &gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. So, uh Dr. Rams is in Pennsylvania, Rich is in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Scott, you are in Tennessee, so you&#x27;re in a different area where we haven&#x27;t heard as much about this. Tell us about your sighting. &gt;&gt; Yeah, mine mine&#x27;s different than yours alls. Mine&#x27;s a lot different. Mine don&#x27;t look like like what you&#x27;re showing there at all.</p>
<p>These things are round. The ones that I saw were round and they&#x27;ve got this ring around them and around the ring. It&#x27;s got little lights on it and the light is spinning. On the video that I sent you guys, you can see that at first before I zoom in on it because when I zoom in, it gets all blurry and it looks like it&#x27;s changing uh shapes, but it really isn&#x27;t. But if you look really closely, you&#x27;ll see how it&#x27;s it there&#x27;s a thing spinning around it.</p>
<p>And it and so I don&#x27;t know what I but mine didn&#x27;t look like a plane at all. And I saw like 30 of them all together. Yeah, that thing right there was the first one. I believe that was the first one. And when it scooches in, you can sort of see see that.</p>
<p>You can sort of see there&#x27;s something spinning around it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s hooked to it. It&#x27;s like a ring that &gt;&gt; it&#x27;s so hard at night to video these things. I mean, that&#x27;s the thing.</p>
<p>It looks so distinctive in the video. Even with our new iPhones, it&#x27;s justn&#x27;t a plane, Scott, because sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell. &gt;&gt; Oh, positive. I I think I think all three of your guests tonight, we&#x27;re all professional observers, and that&#x27;s one of the things that we that we check out. What does it sound like? What does it look like? What does it do? What does it sound like? And that had no sound at all.</p>
<p>And there were at one point there were there were five when I when I after I saw this one and there were three up in in the uh by themselves and there were two ahead of it that came that came past those and then as they went on the other three started following that that one. Then they split up and then I got video of where they There&#x27;s one there in different sections of the front yard and the backyard. You could see them through the trees, but it but the these were completely different than than what you guys were seeing. This these are completely different. &gt;&gt; So, Rich, you&#x27;ve been reporting on this for for a couple of days.</p>
<p>What do you make of the Homeland Security response that essentially um the people are misidentifying these objects that most of the time it&#x27;s planes and uh the secretary, Homeland Security Secretary was actually on TV tonight saying, you know, there&#x27;s no they keep saying there&#x27;s no threat to the public. I I mean, you&#x27;ve seen them for yourself. You don&#x27;t seem satisfied with that response. &gt;&gt; All due respect, Brian, to the to the uh security adviser. It&#x27;s tonedeaf.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s insulting. Um you know, I know a bunch of state legislators and uh sheriffs here in New Jersey who would be happy to talk to him. The Ocean County Sheriff told me a story yesterday that over the weekend there was a one of his officers was on the beach, called 911, reported seeing 50 50 drones come off the ocean inland. Um they they called everybody, the FBI, the Coast Guard, whatever. The Coast Guard went out to investigate, told them they had 13 drones following them in.</p>
<p>This is documented stuff. This isn&#x27;t just like, you know, Bill down the street is calling this in and nobody&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s verifying these things. These are real people. Like police officers um you know, this is happening. So they they need to to get they should frankly they should be scrambling something up here, you know, like figure it out.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t put a plane up just to like say here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve done. But to see no response, no federal response is is truly upsetting. And the longer this goes on, as I mentioned before, somebody&#x27;s just going to take matters into their own hands and just, you know, now that Trump is is is saying what he&#x27;s saying, they&#x27;re they&#x27;re just going to they&#x27;re going to do it. They&#x27;re going to take a rifle and shoot one of these things. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, look, with video and phones and social media, you know, you can&#x27;t just say, &quot;Oh, nothing to see here anymore.&quot; The government can&#x27;t really get away with that anymore. I mean, that clearly everybody&#x27;s seeing it. I&#x27;m just curious, Rich, I&#x27;m looking at your video again. It&#x27;s such good video you got, but you can see the the blinking on the like it almost looks like wings almost like a plane would. Which makes me think, you know, do you think based on what you saw these are some kind of military drone, some kind of technology that because, you know, with UFOs that we&#x27;ve covered, there&#x27;s no this looks like man-made maybe.</p>
<p>I could say from what I&#x27;m seeing, although it&#x27;s blurry. I mean, is that the sense that you got? &gt;&gt; I I hope so, Brian. Like that thought went through my mind and there is some sort of like &gt;&gt; hope in my brain that this is a secret military operation that you know at a base near here and they&#x27;re playing they&#x27;re calling it red teaming where they&#x27;re they&#x27;re they&#x27;re coming out to test for in uh you know lapses in our security and where we would be at fault. I hope that that&#x27;s the solution or that&#x27;s what we find out in a week or two weeks. Uh if we don&#x27;t find that out, if it&#x27;s not our military, I it&#x27;s worse.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a scary scenario if it&#x27;s not our military, &gt;&gt; right? If it&#x27;s something from another country. What do you think, Dr. Rams? I mean, you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve covered everything in that from the vampires to the killers. And I mean, I I&#x27;m just curious what you like what goes through your mind when when when you were looking up even tonight. Is it do you think it&#x27;s a military exercise? Like, what&#x27;s your gut telling you? I I&#x27;m frustrated with the government response because you can&#x27;t say we don&#x27;t know what it is and also say it&#x27;s not a threat because if you don&#x27;t know what it is, you don&#x27;t know that.</p>
<p>And who knows if it&#x27;s a future threat. They might be gathering intel that will come back on us eventually and it&#x27;s a it could be a matter of national security. Why can&#x27;t they act on that alone? that&#x27;s potentially it is a threat and just rope one of those things in. Take a net up there in a helicopter or something. They&#x27;re not that far away from us.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re not way up in the sky. They they can fly pretty low quite [snorts] often. &gt;&gt; Thanks for watching. Go to joinn.com to find NewsNation on your screen.
