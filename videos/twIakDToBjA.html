            <p>what is anti-crafting well anti-gravity is better to be called something called negative gravity you may have heard of the equation which is equals mc squared which has to do with NG being equivalent to mass and with enough Mass you have gravity in the same way though it&#x27;s possible to get negative energy by effectively borrowing the energy from the universe through a quantum mechanical phenomenon and it creates something directly that be negative mass that could produce negative gravity that would have a repulsive effect instead of attractive effect</p>
