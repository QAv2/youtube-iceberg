            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>What&#x27;s up betterers? Patrick here with Betted. Today we&#x27;re talking about [music] this. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got one, I believe, major potential whistleblower um that that might be coming forward at least to meet with my me and Anna and Tim in the coming in the coming month really. And so that&#x27;s something that Grush has been working on. I don&#x27;t want to say obviously for obvious [music] reasons who that is.</p>
<p>unfortunately now deceased Vice President Dick Cheney, [music] uh Darth Vader himself, not shocking that he was involved in this and [music] essentially when he left in 2009, that was the last time that these activities really had central leadership. Uh without being inappropriate, I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue, managed [music] the crash retrieval issue, and when he was the DNI, USDI, DIA director, he placed [music] people in critical roles uh to manage this issue uh both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say not uh non-publicly as well. All &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; right, betterers. Please hit that like button. That really helps out the videos.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button, y&#x27;all. All right, better. So, I&#x27;m still a little sick, so pardon the voice, but we&#x27;re going to power through this. Now, what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, it&#x27;s about James Clappa and some comments that David Grush recently made on an interview he did with uh Megan Kelly, but there&#x27;s a lot more to this. Sometimes you got to wait till the dust settles as everyone&#x27;s been talking about this viral clip, but I uncovered a lot more things and we got a lot to break down in this video.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s jump to this first clip of David Grush on Megan Kelly um talking about James Clapper. And I did want to point out uh General Clapper, the former DNI in the documentary. Um I certainly applaud him for at least speaking out in general. Um he goes on, I believe, I&#x27;ve only seen clips of Agent Disclosure, not the whole thing. um where there was a program when he was the director of national intelligence uh where they were tracking these vehicles over Area 51, of course, the famed uh classified test location.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m a little bit disappointed as a fellow Air Force officer and certainly General Clapper rose to the ranks as three star general. Uh that&#x27;s all he said in the documentary that that was uh a program he was aware of. Uh, in fact, uh, without being inappropriate, I will say that General Clapper was well aware of the crash retrieval issue, managed the crash retrieval issue, and when he was the DNI, USDI, and DIA director, he placed people in critical roles uh, to manage this issue uh, both publicly and I&#x27;ll just say not uh, non-publicly as well. and I&#x27;ll allow the audience uh distill what I&#x27;m saying uh at the at the risk of being inappropriate or going too far with my uh discussion. So, uh General Clapper, Stephanie Sullivan, other folks in the IC that are well aware of this issue that were in rooms discussing this issue, um I ask you to be uh greater leaders on this.</p>
<p>I should not be the only former uh military officer and intelligence official uh that is uh being completely candid with the information that they were exposed to. So um perhaps &gt;&gt; once again James Clapper understates what he knows and what he&#x27;s done notingly. Um &gt;&gt; yeah now there&#x27;s an interesting part in there where David Gush claims like oh I haven&#x27;t seen the age of disclosure documentary only seen some clips. Just pin that because we&#x27;re going to come back to that. But let&#x27;s continue with this, you know, allegation that uh David Grush is throwing out here, right, about James Clapper, right? And this is big, right? Because in the age of disclosure documentary, he basically states that um you know, James Clapper only mentioned that there was a program over at Area 51 this and that and David Gush is simply implying that well wait a second James Clapper you know a lot more than what you said in the documentary.</p>
<p>Right. So here&#x27;s Dan Farah on Joe Rogan explaining that a little bit more. Jim Clapper guy&#x27;s never talked about this topic in his life. He&#x27;s in his 80s. He was the head of Air Force intelligence.</p>
<p>who was the director of national intelligence, never publicly spoken about UAP. He goes on, he comes out and does the interview and he told me, excuse me, [clears throat] he told me that he was doing it because it was important to do and that the people needed to know. And he he drops the bomb in the film that that UAP activity over Area 51 is real. It&#x27;s in fact real. And he goes on the record saying that the Air Force has had a program to investigate this stuff, whereas the Air Force is saying they haven&#x27;t had a program since Project Blue Book.</p>
<p>So, I think the people that I interviewed really felt like a weight on their shoulders to get this off their chest. And to give you more context on Clapper, the guy, the poor guy&#x27;s wife was in the hospital dying. He left the hospital to come do the interview. And I actually said to him, I was like, &quot;Are you sure you want to do this today?&quot; And he&#x27;s like, &quot;No, I want to do it. It&#x27;s important.&quot; &gt;&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; So, like I think I I really felt it. These people all felt like the public needed to know the base facts that they could lawfully disclose. And look, it&#x27;s not the first time that James Clapper has talked about UAP himself, he did a CNN interview. Um, not too long ago, well, it&#x27;s been years actually now where he kind of admitted some regret about how he handled, you know, UFOs. &gt;&gt; So, next month, a government report is expected to be made public on the sightings of UFOs.</p>
<p>As the former director of national intelligence, I think there there have been a lot of theories about UFOs. What do you make of these revelations? What might this be? Have you seen any yourself? What do you make of this? &gt;&gt; Well, uh, first I think it is kind of, uh, there there is logic to the intelligence community addressing this since the intelligence community has a lot of practice of dealing with ambiguity and less than complete facts. And secondly, I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really important that the whenever we uh witness such phenomenon that it is recorded and documented uh for the future uh when we may have gather more information and have a better understanding of uh what&#x27;s what is what&#x27;s transpiring. Uh could there be life out there? Sure. Uh as as huge as the universe is, we you know we you really can&#x27;t reject that possibility.</p>
<p>So I think this is a good thing. the transparency. Uh I expect this report will be filled with ambiguity as well and people uh depending on their leanings will extract what they want out of this report. &gt;&gt; How it always goes, right? Where there is amb ambiguity, people can pull what they want from it. But it is it does sound like it is, you know, something that we haven&#x27;t seen before, this type of transparency around this topic.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yes. And you know, I&#x27;m not sure why that is. Uh the only reason for uh to me for classification would be if there&#x27;s some sensitive method that uh data relating to u so-called UFOs was collected. But other than that, I don&#x27;t know why we haven&#x27;t been more transparent about it in the past. And and I I&#x27;m I&#x27;m part of that crime, I guess.</p>
<p>uh and my former capacities were uh you know I didn&#x27;t I I didn&#x27;t insist on more transparency with respect to this issue. &gt;&gt; And to be fair, you know, David Gush isn&#x27;t the only one that&#x27;s brought up, you know, UFOs and James Clapper in the UFO world, right? Our favorite Luellando has also brought him up. Here&#x27;s a clip from that UFO podcast years ago where he brought up James Clapper as well. Furthermore, what I&#x27;ll share, which I haven&#x27;t shared publicly, is that the the former USDI before he came became the DNI, director of national intelligence, his name was Jim Clapper, General Clapper. He was also the director of several organizations before.</p>
<p>A very good man. Um, polit politics aside, you know, I don&#x27;t take sides politically. I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re you&#x27;re liberal or conservative or anything in between. The bottom line, he was he was a very very good intelligence officer and a very good leader when he was in. Um, and what I will say is that he was he was I won&#x27;t go to a whole lot of detail, but he expressed to me if at some point you ever get a chance to talk to him, uh he in front of my my wife, he said, &quot;Look, I&#x27;m I&#x27;m really glad, Lou, you were doing this.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m really glad we had a had a UFO program. It&#x27;s something that we we should have done.&quot; &gt;&gt; And even Ross Coltart and Bryce Zable on the Need to Know podcast years ago as well talked about James Clapper. I think mate the the glaring emission in the hearing from the 17th of May, the first congressional hearing was that neither Ron Moltry, the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, nor Scott Bray, the deputy director of naval intelligence, talked about the possibility, even the possibility of extraterrestriality. In fact, &gt;&gt; although Ross, I should say the reason they probably didn&#x27;t talk about that is they couldn&#x27;t pronounce it any more than I could. And [laughter] I don&#x27;t even know if you go to the dictionary if it&#x27;s a word, but I will say this, they should have paid heed to some of their bosses and the and the folks they take uh you know they take lunches with in the intelligence business because not only did Averil Haynes suggest that we had to keep open that possibility, but former CIA directors Clapper and Brennan have both in the past year basically uh made statements that leave it quite clear that they&#x27;re thinking about the very same thing.</p>
<p>So, it was uh extremely odd to have people at the very top saying, &quot;Oh, yeah, we better keep our minds open to a really mind-blowing conclusion.&quot; Well, at the same time, they send these two, I don&#x27;t want to call them lackeyis because lackeyis usually implies that they&#x27;re lower level. These guys were not lower level, but they were clearly not there to have a meeting of the minds and share a lot of truth. They were not there for that. &gt;&gt; And it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Here&#x27;s former NSA director Mike Rogers, okay, who served from 2014 to 2018 also talking about an unusual request he got from James Clapper.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; There&#x27;s kind of shifted in the consciousness in recent years and that&#x27;s UAPs, UFOs. &gt;&gt; Ah, there you go. [laughter] the the question they want and one question in particular stands out to me where they said well look uh whether these UAPs that have been on Navy film and so on are um explained by a just a huge advance in technology from a rival nation or something that the United States is developing or something that is simply inexplicable. What is your perspective on that? because we know that Congress has taken interest. Certain members of Congress have spoken about this um and clearly a lot of people online, they see the videos, they they they see the stories.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; This is a good conspiracy theory topic. It seems to energize a lot of people. &gt;&gt; So, so so what are your what are your views on that and and uh and what do you make of people&#x27;s interest in that as a subject? So, first of all, I can still remember this is probably back in 2015 when the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, calls me, &quot;Mike, I need you to go through all of it. I need the team to go through all of NSA&#x27;s holding all of its files, and I need everything that you have on UFOs.&quot; And I&#x27;m like, &quot;What, sir? [laughter] You want me to do a review of our databases on UFOs?&quot; And I&#x27;m literally thinking to myself, is this some kind of joke? But um clearly it&#x27;s not which is reflected in the question for a lot of people this is hey what is going on out there look I clearly there are phenomena occurring out there that both are visible and that we can&#x27;t explain I I don&#x27;t know what what what causes them I don&#x27;t know what they are I don&#x27;t know why um I never saw anything in my experience in the government 37 years both as an intelligence professional but also as a senior military individual I never saw anything that led me to believe that there was some external i.e. non-aterrestrial actor behind this kind of activity.</p>
<p>But the flip side is I couldn&#x27;t explain yet some of the activity. I just don&#x27;t know. But then you have to wonder is James Clapper even trustworthy? Like even what he&#x27;s saying about UFOs, can we even trust anything he&#x27;s saying? Right? Take a look at this tweet from Tulsi Gabbard. Newly declassified top secret emails sent on December 22nd, 2016 complying with President Obama&#x27;s order to create the manufactured January 2017 About Russia expose how DNI James Clapper demanded the IC fall in line behind the Russia hoax. Clapper admits that it was a quote team sport that required quote compromise on our quote normal modalities.</p>
<p>Read for yourself below. Then she includes the documents there. So, can James Clapper even be trusted? Right? Even if he says stuff about UFOs, can we even trust what he&#x27;s saying? Right? Cuz he clearly would bend at will to just sort of cover up national security. And then people might say, &quot;Well, yeah, he&#x27;s doing that to cover up UFOs.&quot; But yeah, but I just don&#x27;t even think he would bring it up, right? But then why is David Gush saying this? And where does he even get that information from? Right, David Grush. And remember that clip I showed you about Mike Rogers, the former NSA director, right? Talking about the files that was requested from James Clapper.</p>
<p>Well, apparently James Clapper tried to get Mike Rogers fired, right? So [music] is Mike Rogers just kind of trying to make him look like a goofball here, right? Take take a look at this um Washington Post uh clip here. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have asked President Obama to fire Admiral Michael Rogers. The director of the National Security Agency, the Washington Post reported Saturday. So, this was a few years ago. So, I just I mean I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>This is so interesting. And it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Here&#x27;s a tweet from Matt Taibbei. We found what wasn&#x27;t really there. Quote, James Clapper was in charge of image analysis before the Iraq war and boasted his images quote carried the day for Co and Powell in his speech to the UN.</p>
<p>He coped to finding things that quote weren&#x27;t really there. So, could he be just making this stuff up about UFOs as well? Right? I don&#x27;t know. How trustworthy is James Clapper? All of a sudden, we&#x27;re supposed to believe him now when he starts talking about UFOs. I got to admit, there&#x27;s some red flags here. But of course, everyone&#x27;s like, &quot;James Clapper said, &quot;Oh my god, it&#x27;s happening.</p>
<p>[music] It&#x27;s happening. Disclosure is coming. James Clapper, but wait a second. Maybe he&#x27;s just a complete liar.&quot; Right? Again, I want to know where David Grush is getting this stuff about, well, he knew about this and he knew [music] about that and he was in charge of this and he was in charge of that. Right? I mean, does David Grush really know what he&#x27;s talking about? I like David Grush, but maybe he&#x27;s also a little misinformed.</p>
<p>Remember when David Grush um said in that clip that I showed you that, you know, he&#x27;d only seen clips of the Age of Disclosure, not the full thing? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;ve only seen clips of Age of Disclosure, not the whole thing. &gt;&gt; You must be thinking, well, that&#x27;s so unusual. Why Why hasn&#x27;t he seen the whole movie? First of all, why is he not in the movie, right? Well, I covered this a while back when I did my review of Age of Disclosure, but um let&#x27;s refresh our memory. Okay, here&#x27;s a clip of George Knapp and Jeremy Corbel talking about it. &gt;&gt; Would have been a valuable addition to the movie.</p>
<p>Why do you suppose he wasn&#x27;t in it? &gt;&gt; Well, I I think he you know, he definitely chose not to be in it. I remember helping to make that connection with Dan so that they could have that conversation. You know, I think Dave has a kind of different tactic to getting out what he knows to be true. Dave is a true whistleblower. This is not a managed message with with with Dave.</p>
<p>Not that it is with the other guys, but it is at least authorized with with Dave. You know, he really is working on a fundamental attitude that nobody has the right to hold this back. So, let let&#x27;s go to his interview for one second. Um, yeah, I I helped in just trying to get uh, you know, him in touch with a network and a producer that would uh, be able to hear what he had to say and treat it properly. I mean, we could have done the same, George, but you know, President Trump doesn&#x27;t watch weaponized as far as as I know.</p>
<p>So, um, yeah. So, David Gush talked again and I was really glad he decided to cuz he&#x27;s not all over the media. I I I do think that he has a difference of opinion and that&#x27;s for him to talk about um when it comes to this stuff. You know, he really thinks everybody should just open up and say what they know. For example, he thinks that if Lu Allezando was part of the Legacy UFO program that he should just say it, go out on the limb and just say it.</p>
<p>And um I so I think that&#x27;s the difference of opinion. I think um the the film would have had Dave participate if Dave had agreed, but I think that he was he&#x27;s just on a different path. Am I explaining that uh clearly? &gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I mean, I always thought that was weird that David Grush wasn&#x27;t in Age of Disclosure and then now you find out he hasn&#x27;t even seen the the movie, right? Cuz he&#x27;s just thinking differently. So, I don&#x27;t know. Again, you got all these narratives behind the scene of people differently this that, right? And essentially he believes like why aren&#x27;t these people coming out and saying something more? They know more. Come out and say it. Um but even David Gush holds back.</p>
<p>So I that&#x27;s so unusual, right? Because you even have Lu Alzando, you know, said this on a podcast um a while back which nobody talks about. Um it was called the World of Big Ideas podcast and he said this about working with David Grush. &gt;&gt; Uh and and I had it easy. A lot of people said it was horrible what you went through and yeah, you know what? It it wasn&#x27;t fun. But there&#x27;s a lot of people like Dave Grouch who had to go through a lot worse than I did as far as repercussions.</p>
<p>Uh within 24 hours they tried to bury his career and um you know love him or hate him irrelevant. He&#x27;s he&#x27;s he is a patriot and I worked with him at US Space Force. I I I wasn&#x27;t allowed to say where but I at this point I don&#x27;t care anymore because people are like oh well you know he didn&#x27;t really Yes he did. We worked in this SAP F facility a skiff together and our only job was UAP and no one knows that and I&#x27;ll tell you right here and right now for the first time that&#x27;s exactly what we were working on and Space Force was paying us to do it and this was after ATIP. So people are saying, &quot;Oh, well, there wasn&#x27;t anything to see here.&quot; That&#x27;s not true.</p>
<p>And in fact, some of the most compelling data that we have right now in the US government was a result of our time at Space Force, not at AIP, because we had better technology, more capabilities, more persistence. Um, I&#x27;m hopeful that story will be told sometime because people like Dave, you know, I hate talking about myself. I I just um I do suffer a little bit from imposter syndrome because I know a lot of people had a lot worse than me. So I don&#x27;t want to be the poster child of you know victimization. &gt;&gt; Um you know I don&#x27;t look at victimization as a virtue.</p>
<p>I look it as a challenge that we all have to overcome as human beings. It&#x27;s part of the human experience. Right. &gt;&gt; And of course that information has never come out. But David Gush has never mentioned that as well.</p>
<p>So is Lu Alzando lying or right? And if David Gush is like hey come out and say what you know. Well David Gush isn&#x27;t saying it either unless Lu Alzando is lying about having worked with David Gush&#x27;s Space Force. again a spiderweb of convoluted comments and right it&#x27;s like what are we supposed to do with all this right it&#x27;s like when you try to start connecting the dots nothing connects nothing connects you know this is all meant to be you just watch this from a surface level point but when you have to deal with it like I do you start to see that these things don&#x27;t make sense and then you have to ask yourself do I just ignore that do I not tell people that these things don&#x27;t make sense do I not point out these red flags. I can&#x27;t do that. I can&#x27;t do that.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t just ignore what&#x27;s right in front of me. Right. So, I don&#x27;t know. What do you think? Let me know in the comments. Let&#x27;s move on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, now deceased uh Vice President Dick Cheney, uh Darth Vader himself, not shocking that he was involved in this. And essentially, when he left in 2009, that was the last time that these activities really had central leadership. &gt;&gt; And then you got David Grush just outing Dick Cheney. And this not the first time this has been told. journalist Walter Kern also talked about this a while ago um when he interviewed David Gush and apparently David Gush told him this [music] right Dick Cheney was at the head and since Dick Cheney um left in 2009 no one&#x27;s been at the head of this UFO legacy program so [music] since 2009 it&#x27;s been running around like the Headless Horseman right um which is interesting um I don&#x27;t know right like where&#x27;s that and Dick Cheneyy&#x27;s of course passed away.</p>
<p>And guess who worked with Dick Cheney? You know, James Clapper as well, right? So, I don&#x27;t know. This is all so confusing. Was Dick Cheney at the top and James Clapper was running it too? I mean, I don&#x27;t know. Let me know what you think in the comments. &gt;&gt; You know, if Marco Rubio called you tomorrow and said, &quot;What should we do about this?&quot; What would you say? &gt;&gt; Yeah, he certainly gave a deflated response on Hannity recently, saying he has no ability to investigate.</p>
<p>certainly as a national security adviser uh secretary of state and the chief archavist of the United States which that last position is actually uh very important because under national archives they manage the public interest the classification board and between that and the presidential intelligence advisory board currently chaired by Mr. Deon Nunees um and his uh connection to the cabinet officials. Um certainly uh Secretary Rubio or National Security Advisor Rubio um should uh authorize a legal unlawful investigation using resources in the Department of Justice in the Internal Revenue Service because there&#x27;s been a lot of procurement fraud, a lot of um misappropriation of funds, also white collar and blue collar crime uh to include uh harming &gt;&gt; um officials. So uh certainly &gt;&gt; but where would he start? Who would he whose tires would he kick first? &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a a question uh or she&#x27;s an answer I would I would provide in person in a prescriptive manner behind the scenes. Uh certainly uh there are elements within uh the central intelligency agency director of science and technology that would start there.</p>
<p>There are certain career officials uh that are still there that manage the issue. uh there are certain officials uh that are longtimers in the office of the director of national intelligence um that have been there for a very very long time uh that also helped manage this issue for a while. So I certainly have the rolodex of names offices um and I&#x27;ve I certainly have bumped into the halls and walls facilities where everything is. So I think it&#x27;s u secretary Rubio liazing with the vice president and uh President Trump uh getting the boss&#x27;s strategic vision on this how they would like to proceed publicly but privately uh and start going after some of those agencies and and the department of the air force particular offices and organizations within there that are where very uh near and dear to my heart uh were also involved. So I have to be a little evasive and vague publicly.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like to tip off. Uh &gt;&gt; you&#x27;re already doing so much to to tell us what we need to know. I I appreciate it. I know there&#x27;s certain lines you can&#x27;t cross or you get in trouble. &gt;&gt; And what David Gush doesn&#x27;t mention there is that also in that same Fox interview that he&#x27;s alluding to, um Marco Rubio said that his section in the Age of Disclosure was selectively edited, right? And that he was just a senator at that time, not Secretary of State.</p>
<p>and he hasn&#x27;t been able to verify any of those claims, right? And he wasn&#x27;t really talking about UFOs, right? He was talking about Strategic Surprise in a different way if you haven&#x27;t seen the movie. Spoiler alert. &gt;&gt; But I got to ask you, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a show that&#x27;s come out. It&#x27;s called The Age of Disclosure. &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. I know everyone [laughter] probably, right? Everyone asks you about it. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a new documentary. We had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not ours and presidents operate on a need to know basis. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. That is &gt;&gt; so so a couple points on it. First of all, I&#x27;m not disavowing that.</p>
<p>That was an interview that was done almost maybe three or four years ago when I was in the Senate, right? So it wasn&#x27;t recent. The second point I would make, I was describing the allegations that people have come forward where they have people that came forward to us. You know, some of these people were navy pilots, admirals, generals, whatever that would come forward and say um that there were programs in the US government that not even presidents were made aware of. So, I was describing what people had said to me, not things that I have firsthand knowledge of in that regard. Little bit of selective editing, but it&#x27;s okay cuz, you know, you&#x27;re trying to sell a show there.</p>
<p>Um but right it it&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of things we should be doing or that this should happen or this should but nothing happens right this will be the year right we&#x27;re just spinning our wheels here right and if the secretary of state is not actively interested in this maybe there&#x27;s nothing to it right cuz why wouldn&#x27;t he look into this I mean look at what we&#x27;re starting around the world right now right we just took took Maduro from Venezuela. Um, not to get political, okay? Um, just stating facts, right? We&#x27;re looking at other countries. We&#x27;re getting involved. There&#x27;s foreign relations happening, right? Clearly, there&#x27;s stuff with China, Russia, right? Why wouldn&#x27;t we use this stuff? Secretary of State, he&#x27;d be all over this, right? Something&#x27;s just not adding up, right? And this whole disclosure that was going to come from Trump because of the age of disclosure, nothing has happened, right? Trump hasn&#x27;t even seen the movie. Secretary of State saying they selectively edited that and then nobody seems to mention that, right? And again, I made a whole video about how they propped up Marco Rubio as being the guy and then he comes out and just sweeps the legs out.</p>
<p>You know, put him in a body bag, Johnny. &gt;&gt; So, you okay? Can you go on? &gt;&gt; Get him a body bag. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Shout out Karate Kid. Anyway, let&#x27;s move on.</p>
<p>Uh early on the global war on terror, a lot of the money that was initially given to these companies was essentially reallocated uh for overseas contingency operations. And these contractors essentially uh started to do their own thing, if you will, something called IRAD, internal research and development. And uh privately they continued certain things that actually the government was trying to cancel as it relates to the subject. and they went off um and retrieved and exploited things essentially on their own uh and only loosely accountable back uh to their government handlers. And it&#x27;s it&#x27;s funny you mentioned the CIA.</p>
<p>Um naturally, there&#x27;s a lot of uh good men and women that work there. Uh my wife actually was a CIA officer and she also served in the Air Force with me. Um but uh Chairwoman Luna and the task force and the committee staff uh certainly I assisted in my other uh professional capacity um helping Representative Burlson&#x27;s office did send legal interrogatives uh to several agencies and private companies. CIA was one of them. Um and curiously enough uh CIA provided what I considered extremely disrespectful response.</p>
<p>They declined to answer our interrogatives on this matter, which is their participation in crash retrieval operations, and just referred us to the Pentagon&#x27;s Arrow Office, which has a nebulous in concerning history in itself. And I just find it very interesting that CIA uh did that. Now, I&#x27;m not saying John Rackcliffe or Michael Ellis, who&#x27;s the acting general counsel and deputy director, had a hand in that response. Uh but they certainly are the leaders of their organization. John Rackcliffe has spoke positively on this issue previously.</p>
<p>And I I would hope that John Rackcliffe was placed there uh by DNI Gabbard and the president to enact some reforms on the CIA. And unfortunately, the CIA has a lot of skeletons in its closets. Um other things I know about that I can&#x27;t talk about that are conventional national security issues. Uh but the crash retrieval issue unfortunately is is certainly one of them. And they&#x27;ve um done a lot of concerning things.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s being alleged by you and many others is that is that they have &gt;&gt; literal skeletons in their closet or whatever &gt;&gt; they do &gt;&gt; whatever&#x27;s inside an alien being. &gt;&gt; So the CIA has some skeletons in their closet. Yeah, they do. MK Ultra among other things, right? So that&#x27;s no mystery to me um at all. And could there be something there? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>That gets talked about a lot with the CIA. But again, at the end of the day, no proof, no evidence, just a lot of chatter. Let&#x27;s move on. &gt;&gt; Ask you a little bit about the work that you&#x27;ve been doing with David Grush because um as far as I um the last time I checked, you were talking to Steven Diner, who&#x27;s a friend of uh he&#x27;s he&#x27;s a colleague of mine, and you told him that Grush probably was going to stay until um next year as well. Um do you have do you guys have any um like planned schedule or any type of um yeah strategy to move forward over the next six months or so? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Grush has been a tremendous asset to my team and I and I want to make it very clear and clarify that Grush works for my office.</p>
<p>He does not work for the committee itself. um that that&#x27;s the only way that we were able to pull this off, but he works for my office and he&#x27;s been providing tremendous guidance and insights and as a as an adviser in this topic. Um Grush helped us write the interrogatives, the letters that we that we sent to the CIA, that we sent to the aerospace corporation and um and the Navy as well. Um and and Grush is going to continue to to help in that regard. I think we have got some more letters that we&#x27;re that we&#x27;re putting together.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve already had um a briefing from the aerospace corporation in a secure setting. Um I can what I can say is that it really didn&#x27;t turn up anything whatsoever. Um but but at least um we got a response and and they took the time to fly uh to DC to to meet with us in person. So, and that was kind of a good indicator that these companies do take these letters seriously and and hopefully we can continue in that and and try to get down to at least um get some answers. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>So, you know, Grush has been working with Eric Berles, right, behind the scenes um trying to get some stuff going. Uh they couldn&#x27;t do anything with the NDAA, this UAP amendment that they&#x27;ve been talking about for years, right? That fell through. And Berles kind of explains in that clip uh on Secoactivo which I&#x27;ll put a link down below. You can go check out the rest of that. Um but essentially it&#x27;s just such small movement, right? Cuz GR had come out with this big investigation.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just like nothing has happened, right? And then it&#x27;s there&#x27;s always like something around the corner, right? We got this big whistleblower getting ready to come out, right? As Eric Berles states here. In addition, um, Grush has brought a lot of witnesses to me. Um, some that some that are not willing to go forward. I&#x27;ve had multiple meetings with some very interesting individuals that have given me a lot of insight and that would have only been available because Grush had contacts to those people and they felt comfortable and trusting um, you know, Grush. And so and and then we&#x27;ve got we&#x27;ve got one I believe major potential whistleblower um that that might be coming forward at least to meet with my me and Anna and Tim in the coming in the coming month really.</p>
<p>And so that&#x27;s something that Grush has been working on. I don&#x27;t want to say obviously for obvious reasons who that is. &gt;&gt; So again, you know, maybe this brand new whistleblower is going to come forward everyone&#x27;s going to fall head over heels for and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll cover on this channel, right? But it just doesn&#x27;t move the needle. Are we ever going to get really a true whistleblower, right, who doesn&#x27;t go through these channels like this? I don&#x27;t know. Maybe this just is a long journey, you know, to make this happen.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. Government disclosure just seems so dead to me. And look, just to be fair to the whole thing, a brand new report has just come out from John Greenwall of the Black Vault. Okay. Um, and people are probably going to be pretty upset by this, but you know, got to be transparent and fair here.</p>
<p>All right, so um, essentially this report came out against Grush that doesn&#x27;t look too good. Let me explain. This is a tweet from Steven Greenreet. I know journalist for the New York Post. I use the term journalist loosely, but he&#x27;s basically just taking all of John Greenwald&#x27;s work here and, you know, regurgitating it, which is fine.</p>
<p>So, shout out to John Greenwald really for doing all the leg work here. But take a look at this. The DoDig did a year&#x27;slong extensive investigation into all of this and released their final report [music] in February of 2025. That report was just publicly released via Foya to the Black Vault. Here is the report.</p>
<p>The report completely demolishes Grush&#x27;s claims. Turns out Grush being stripped of his top secret clearances had nothing to do with UFOs. In fact, internal communications show officials were confused that Grush was claiming whistleblower reprisals because of UFOs because Grush didn&#x27;t even actually provide any evidence of anything. One official wrote, &quot;On what grounds does Grush have for a whistleblower case? He didn&#x27;t blow any whistle or bring to light any info.&quot; Another internal communication in the report shows officials describing the gruff situation as quote goofy. The ultimate truth is that Grush was actually stripped of his security clearances because he had a history of quote behavior issues, was quote untrustworthy, and had broken many rules unrelated to UFOs.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, which is the central authority that determines eligibility for security clearances, stated it was quote clearly inconsistent with the national interest. to continue Grush&#x27;s access to classified information. The CAF told Gush in writing, quote, &quot;A whole person assessment of your behavior as identified under these concerns reflects questionable judgment, lack of cander, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, raising questions about your reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. In essence, they considered Grush to be a loose cannon and a threat to national security. At one point, they collected quote all of his access badges [music] and walked him out of the building.</p>
<p>They later reassigned him to work that didn&#x27;t require top secret clearances. So, again, just had to include that. I&#x27;m going to put a link down below to the report. Think of it what you want. It&#x27;s important to share all the facts and you can make up your own mind, right? Does this completely, you know, debunk Grush as a whistleblower? I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>Is it important to consider this complaint, this report from the DoD? Yeah, it is. Right. I think it&#x27;s important to take in all the facts. It would be interesting to hear Grush&#x27;s response to this, right, which we may never get because he hardly does interviews. And it would also be interesting to hear Berles&#x27;s response to this as well.</p>
<p>Now, does this negate everything that Grush has been stating as far as you know what he knows? Dick Cheney, James Clapper, this that the other. I mean, if it&#x27;s true, yeah. Yeah, it does. But look, in this same interview with Megan Kelly, Representative Anna Paulina Luna also was interviewed. &gt;&gt; Representative Luna is also fighting for stronger protections for whistleblowers like David Grush, our first guest.</p>
<p>Uh she&#x27;s a veteran of the US Air Force and she has said that she personally had an encounter herself with an object she believes was likely a UAP. She joins me now for the first time. Representative, great to have you. &gt;&gt; Nice to have you, Megan. &gt;&gt; First of all, I didn&#x27;t know she had an encounter herself.</p>
<p>So, that&#x27;s interesting. I may have heard that, but I don&#x27;t recall that. Um she may have talked about that on Joe Rogan, but honestly, I can&#x27;t remember. But either way, that&#x27;s interesting. [music] The push back that we&#x27;ve received has been so um incredibly obvious at this point [music] that it just kind of furthers our own opinions on there are people that are controlling this information and there does seem to be even outside of the purview of I think sometimes our own secretaries who have the best intentions on declassifying this stuff.</p>
<p>There is this internal intelligence battle on this topic. And so you know you&#x27;re talking earlier about whistleblower protections. One of the things that we&#x27;re going to have to do because what I did not want to do is host just another hearing [snorts] with more witness testimony without providing the documents and evidence. I think that that would probably be a waste of resources unless we can provide that directly to the American people. And we have received the list.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s over about 40 different documents um to actually be able to get that information to provide it, but also to to bring forward legislation out of oversight and actually just left a hearing earlier talking to the chairman about it to actually bring forward immunity for all of the people um some of them in the in the film, some personally that we know of to come talk to with us um in a skiff about locations or specifically more information pertaining to this without you know being in fear of basically being hit with. &gt;&gt; So clearly she&#x27;s stating there&#x27;s a cover up. or being stopped or being, you know, and and that seems to be the gist essentially is that anytime there&#x27;s push back or this they they immediately think, well, they wouldn&#x27;t be pushing back unless it was true. But that&#x27;s not necessarily the case, right? They could be pushing back for other reasons, right? That can&#x27;t be our best evidence that this is really happening. Well, why would they push back? Why would they hide this? Why would they hide that? That may give you reason to continue to look, but not reason enough to be like, &quot;That&#x27;s the proof.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the smoking gun. This is real. That there&#x27;s this cover up.&quot; Right? I got to be honest. Um, little by little, I&#x27;m starting to think that there is no real government cover up of UFOs or reverse engineered technology or anything like that. I do think that there is a phenomenon that exists, but I&#x27;m not so sure our government has UFOs or at least not the number that they say or the crashes or the B or all this stuff.</p>
<p>Probably 99% of the information is and it&#x27;s trying to find what&#x27;s that one sliver of truth in all of this. I have no idea. Y&#x27;all help me find this needle in the haystack because the hay stack just keeps getting bigger. All right, y&#x27;all. I hope you enjoyed today&#x27;s video and put source links down below to everything that I brought up today.</p>
<p>Check it out. There&#x27;s more to the Grush interview. So again, link down below. Go check that out. He says a lot more things if you want to go see that.</p>
<p>Uh we&#x27;ll see you guys on the next one. Remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace. I am uh it&#x27;s uh 6:36 [music] in Paduka, Kentucky. And at about 6:05, I seen a strand of look like stars flying in in a straight line, probably 15 to 18 of them.</p>
<p>And they they were above my house. They was all flying in a straight line. And they would disappear one at a time. And they was in a straight line. something like I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve never seen nothing like that around here before.</p>
<p>Um uh today today is uh Tuesday the 6th and this happened at around 6 probably 30 or no it&#x27;s 6:30 now been about 6:15 I immediately called you not trying to get put on the air uh but uh I would like for you to check into it. It&#x27;s like overproduced Kentucky. [music] I don&#x27;t really know who to call or who to to to find out what to do or not what to do but who who to who to ask. I don&#x27;t even know who to ask if what was that, you know. Uh [music] very strange.</p>
<p>If you would, I don&#x27;t know. Look into it. If there&#x27;s something to it, report on it, please. Thank you.</p>
