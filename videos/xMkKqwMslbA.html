            <p>I need an intelligent conversant on the other side I&#x27;m happy to have a debate but I want a debate not based on somebody saying well you know if you got taken AB aboard a craft why didn&#x27;t you bring back an alien alien as well because maybe the aliens have figured out that smoking is not a good idea in the old you know I mean I mean it&#x27;s just like that&#x27;s just such a stupid thing to say and he said it multiple times as far as I remember or at least I&#x27;ve seen him quoted that way multiple times so it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s just and I&#x27;m using him as a as an archetype of a kind of thought process that has infected the media and cultural discussion at large that just needs to be stomped out because isn&#x27;t it fun to talk about ideas and and and limiting ideas limits creativity and limits possibility</p>
