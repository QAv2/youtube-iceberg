            <p>but at least what&#x27;s promising is that there is some at least research or understanding and it&#x27;s actually quite mature at this point and in order to avoid the kinds of Fate that befell Tesla and Reich robbert Oppenheimer Victor schauberger and so many others that were working in these fields all kind of converging on this same Insight it&#x27;s been conducted in secret the laboratory has been that they&#x27;ve been developing this is in the maldi so that it&#x27;s been um immune from government interference and um now I think it&#x27;s about ready to go the next what what is the motivation of the suppressing of this information I think in case of Tesla wasn&#x27;t it military the fear of military applications I also I also think that you know there are huge corporations that have very large investments in a particular path of technology which is ours right and for somebody to come up with a whole new path of technology it&#x27;s very threatening to them uh and and much better from their point of view to suppress it or if they can&#x27;t suppress it to kind of buy it and hide it uh and keep things keep things on the track that they&#x27;re that they&#x27;re on now I would say that&#x27;s the motive and maybe for people that are curious about this and maybe even skeptical consider the massive change that nuclear power provided us whereas before the 1940s this was unheard of this this even the concept of it and all of a sudden now we have nuclear power nuclear weapons the most profound power known to man currently God help us it&#x27;s a power for use by adults</p>
