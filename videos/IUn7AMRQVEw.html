            <p>to how significant is it that the United States government came out a year ago and admitted that unidentified aerial phenomena are real whatever they are they&#x27;re a real mystery I think it tells us that uh first of all the government has been lying to us for the last 60 or 70 years I think it gives Solace to people who have been told that they were crazy to have been believing or seeing this so that to me at least from the personal point of view from the human point of view that&#x27;s one of the most important things I know this is speculative but why do you think the US government&#x27;s lied I think it&#x27;s because frankly they didn&#x27;t understand what it was and nobody wanted to admit that first of all but second they didn&#x27;t want to admit that they didn&#x27;t have control over our airspace we didn&#x27;t have control over our own airspace so the government&#x27;s been lying but do you think there&#x27;s been a cover-up absolutely I mean there has been both uh a cover-up as well as a disinformation campaign to make people look like they uh were crazy see this is amazing to me to hear a scientist of your reputation saying this I mean you&#x27;re one of the most eminent immunologists on the planet you&#x27;re a Nobel Prize nominee you&#x27;re somebody highly respected in your area of Medicine is it a dangerous thing for you to admit that you think these things about the phenomenon I think it&#x27;s dangerously necessary I think that this is the kind of thing that if we continue to ignore it if we continue to ignore the potential danger of what it might represent we are putting ourselves at risk uh both to what it might do to us and sometime in the future but then ignoring the physics of what these things are capable of doing let&#x27;s talk about it what is it you know I wish I knew and of all the people that I&#x27;ve spoken with on the inside there&#x27;s uh really very little unanimity about what it is except for that they&#x27;re whatever it is appears to be so far Advanced from us that it Beggars understanding so you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s human I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not human is it intelligent yes it certainly acts it and in some cases it seems to have a sense of humor so Gary the implications of what you&#x27;re saying there are enormous aren&#x27;t they and you&#x27;re suggesting that there is a highly Advanced civilization that is intelligent it&#x27;s not human and it&#x27;s real yeah I almost hesitate even to call it a civilization a civilization implies a lot of interacting parts uh that are moving towards some sort of goal I I think that what we&#x27;re going through today with this realization it&#x27;s uh uh it&#x27;s kind of like you&#x27;ve lived on an island your whole life and you&#x27;ve looked across the ocean and you&#x27;ve never imagined there was another island with anybody else on it and then suddenly a ship with sales shows up uh you don&#x27;t understand it but you realize that suddenly your world just got a lot bigger I think we&#x27;re in one of those moments right now that our world view are Galactic view is opening right to something a little bit bigger and not just that there might be somebody else but that there&#x27;s something else and what it is is yet to be understood and the fact that it isn&#x27;t understood to me is what&#x27;s exciting because I can fill it with my dreams and I was thinking okay so here you are you&#x27;re a Jet Pilot you&#x27;re flying around and this thing is basically going like this and making right angle turns what can think that fast I mean these things are going at 10 000 miles an hour so you&#x27;re deciding when to take uh so getting from point A to point B is less than a second and then you make another decision to go this direction and another decision to go that direction all in the space of less than a second so you have two possibilities one whatever it is that&#x27;s driving it is thinking very fast so it could be just a computer or two what&#x27;s going on inside the craft and time flow within the craft is going slower than otherwise so I think you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a lot of things about the movements and observables that we can use to start to derive potential boundary conditions on what it is that&#x27;s driving this what&#x27;s behind the scenes did any of the people you interviewed see anybody in control of these craft see any not in this not in these cases but I in the injury cases I do know of cases non-injury Associated where things were seen what kind of things little beings I I don&#x27;t know what to say I know it sounds crazy like what what the eyewitness account said yeah the eyewitness you&#x27;re not ratifying this I&#x27;m not ratified I know the eyewitnesses always talk about something about that tall right with you know they call them the Grays I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with humanoid features now I have a problem with humanoid features because you know one of my backgrounds is evolutionary biology yes and so I don&#x27;t see the possibility of something else evolving on another planet it looks like us you know unless God is intervening in very specific ways almost any thing an octopus could become intelligent and fly around yes so I think that part of what we&#x27;re seeing here I mean look if you&#x27;re an intelligence are you gonna go down on a planet with a bunch of angry monkeys who might kill you no unlikely you&#x27;ll send some intermediary well what kind of intermediary are you going to send you&#x27;re going to send something that maybe almost looks like them but isn&#x27;t them so I think and this is again from inside the intelligence Community most of what we think we&#x27;re seeing are avatars biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions if you will and that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the current view of that that is a it is a hypothesis it&#x27;s I mean to me if I were going to another place or if if I were going to study a native tribe of let&#x27;s say cannibals maybe I wouldn&#x27;t show up in the middle of their Village so that I don&#x27;t inadvertently become dinner yes right so you would send an intermediary first but I&#x27;ve used this example uh I I don&#x27;t know if you know Lex Friedman you probably know Lex Friedman he&#x27;s an interviewer does he&#x27;s an AI scientist at Stanford I did one with him and using an example of the of the ants as well let&#x27;s say that they were in an erasive intelligent ants at the bottom of your garden how do you tell them about Instagram right how do you talk with them how do you interact with them you would probably make something that looked almost like an aunt and you&#x27;d put it down there but then how are you going to interact with them well with pheromones that&#x27;s how they talk but you do something else right you&#x27;re you&#x27;re speaking about whatever it is you talk about at the dinner table but you to translate down to their terms you would have to use some sort of an intermediary so it&#x27;s kind of a lost in translation problem right you you want to put something there that can interact with them so that they can know that there&#x27;s an object but you for instance you&#x27;re not going to show up and put yourself in danger I wouldn&#x27;t I mean we send drones but also I would also say don&#x27;t believe everything you see right um just because you see something doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s actually there you know there&#x27;s there are enough stories about people who feel that these things are projections right that uh so maybe it&#x27;s something projected into an individual&#x27;s mind again this is all conjecture and I again I want to warn the various Skeptics who love to write little nasty grams about me um you know I&#x27;m not uh a born and True Believer I am interested in finding out what the truth is about these things uh I feel that given that there are enough individuals who seem to report seeing the same things uh or experiencing the same things that there&#x27;s a story here that needs to be explained it&#x27;s either Mass Hysteria some form of jungian uh Collective unconscious kind of thing or it&#x27;s or it&#x27;s something real but then once you get to the it&#x27;s something real how real or unreal is it and again if you if people are familiar with um John Keel and Jacques uh primary Theses on this that it&#x27;s you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s an element of reality to this that has yet to be understood it drives me crazy you know thinking about it um and anybody especially with Jacques uh with the background and knowledge about what it is that that shock involves himself with is he&#x27;s always looking for what&#x27;s behind the what&#x27;s behind right that what you&#x27;re presented is um as he often has called it a form of Kabuki theater right it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s something which is meant to be an intermediary or a stand-in for an objective right that these beings or whatever the people claimed it is that they see aren&#x27;t necessarily the the beings or the or the Consciousness as you&#x27;re interested in that&#x27;s actually driving the process that there&#x27;s something put there in the stead of whatever this higher level Consciousness is Mr Carlson is that what intelligence in its right mind to an extent would put itself in danger of interaction with a primitive civilization like us relatively speaking I mean we&#x27;re primitive I mean we&#x27;re we&#x27;re we&#x27;re not only barely out of the caves we&#x27;re we&#x27;re close to putting ourselves back in them you know from from some kind of global catastrophe mistake that we initiate so why would you put yourself at danger of interaction why wouldn&#x27;t you put some kind of Avatar in between yourself and as I&#x27;ve often called us the angry monkeys and so you wouldn&#x27;t in your right mind and so I think that I&#x27;m a hundred percent sure that even in the case of the Virginia event that whatever that was is some kind of Avatar and it wasn&#x27;t actually the object that it it wasn&#x27;t actually if it was a thinking perhaps cautious object but it isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s actually behind the scenes that&#x27;s just a guess I have no proof I don&#x27;t have I I I don&#x27;t get I don&#x27;t get a weekly email from the Illuminati that tell me these things I&#x27;m not an Insider in any Grand sense of the of the word it just right now it makes sense with the data it&#x27;s a possibility new data will maybe change my mind on it earlier you mentioned and many people mentioned this that it&#x27;s it may be that there is some component of projections when it comes to uaps and then it can&#x27;t be all that because like you said yeah there&#x27;s some physical evidence and then I was thinking I&#x27;ve heard this from many other people that depending on the culture at a specific time the beings if there are beings they make themselves comprehensible to that culture so for example perhaps they appear to Sylvan beings like Woodland beings or angels to later generations right and Technology to us to a Godless Nation however I don&#x27;t think it can be just projections because when it comes to the technology side there were reports of ancient flying Roman Shields right and the government also seems to be in possession of actual craft which means they&#x27;re physical so what accounts for this well there&#x27;s two kinds of projections we think of projection in terms of our you know let&#x27;s say current understanding a projection of something on a on a 2d movie screen right um now you can have sort of a holographic projection which is something which appears to be there and you know as and is in and of itself emanating or reflecting light there&#x27;s a projection of something potentially into your head that makes you think you see something but you know again if you&#x27;re talking about a technology that&#x27;s you know millions of years ahead of us maybe it can project material objects you know Jacques uses the term often the phenomenon can take a hold of a volume of of space and make a reality real right it can it can literally change space and manifest uh material objects that&#x27;s a form of a projection at that point does it still retain the word projection because if something was created here then it persists in multiple people well I mean the question is is what is created uh actually functional here in our reality or is it just a piece of plastic that&#x27;s moved from behind the scenes and made to look like it does something so for instance let&#x27;s talk about the so-called craft that people see I mean I would like to think that there&#x27;s an object with a physics and a a physics that can be understood from sitting here in our 3D 4D world but Maybe let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a multi-dimensional reality and whatever it is that is driving these objects sits somewhere else and it&#x27;s basically something that it pokes into our reality and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s moving it from elsewhere it&#x27;s made to look like it&#x27;s moving here but it has no functionality here the functionality doesn&#x27;t reside in our side of of the of the veil the functionality is elsewhere so you know we might get one of these objects let&#x27;s say let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a crashed crafter or beings or whatever and they are no more real than you know a a sculpted object right they they don&#x27;t have the they don&#x27;t have the function here the function is driven from elsewhere and there&#x27;s another peer-reviewed paper called the wow signal in the genetic code by a couple of mathematicians from I think Uzbekistan and I don&#x27;t pretend to understand the math and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some statisticians that would argue with it but their concept was interesting the um the actual what we call the genetic code the the transfer rnas that basically say you know a ProLine goes here or leucine goes there that allow for the proteins to be made they are so well organized in terms of the structure of the of who codes for what um that it looks like it was designed right and then they go through some mathematical models of why it had to have been designed and you know there&#x27;s some caveats that I&#x27;ll mention at the end here uh that uh the chance of it not having been designed is like one in several hundred trillion right right and what they&#x27;re saying is the wow message so you&#x27;ve heard of this thing called the wow message that when somebody first thought that they heard a radio signal from another civilization they said wow they wrote wow on it and that became the wow signal so they said look the signal is actually in our DNA the fact that the DNA was planned and organized is right there in front of us that&#x27;s the wow signal huh</p>
