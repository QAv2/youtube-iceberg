            <p>okay I think we&#x27;re yeah we&#x27;re good okay sorry about that guys um microphone should be working now so welcome to the stream tonight guys uh we&#x27;re going to look at the Thomas Bearden uh psychotronics video okay and it&#x27;s kind of long so I just want to get right into it here tonight chat thanks for being here thanks Arwin I saw Sandy earlier hey prepi UFO nut appreciate you guys being in here we are going to watch this Thomas beard and psychotronics video um I don&#x27;t know I found a couple different versions of this online and one of them has much better uh quality than the other one so we&#x27;re going to try this one okay here we go okay guys I hope you enjoy this uh this video here Thomas Bearden on psychotronics should be awesome let&#x27;s check it out let&#x27;s wait no time let&#x27;s do this move the chat over apologies for the quality the sound quality that&#x27;s just how it is apparently James Clerk Maxwell please welcome Tom beard [Applause] the obvious weapons implication of what I&#x27;m talking about but I would like to address the magic unified field Theory everyone has been looking for how to unite gravitation and electromagnetics in a single theory that is engineerable that can be used on the laboratory bench and it does indeed work I will try to indicate for you exactly what gravity is sorry hang on a second I want to I don&#x27;t know if this is the right video let&#x27;s let&#x27;s just look at this other one real quick okay here we go the obvious weapons implication of what I&#x27;m talking about but I would like to address the magic unified field Theory everyone has been looking for how to unite gravitation and electromagnetics in a single theory that is engineerable that can be used on the laboratory bench and it does indeed work I will try to indicate for you exactly what gravity is and exactly how to manipulate it electromagnetically and I&#x27;ll also indicate for those of you that are very sharp rather precisely how to easily make anti-gravity everything that I&#x27;m saying has a basis on the laboratory bench but I work with inventors so I will not present a circuit I will not present even a picture of a particular piece of equipment nor will I answer such questions but the principles that I give you I will assure you you will have little problem yourself in applying if you&#x27;re an experimentalist and I will also assure you that they do work in the laboratory and if all goes well and the good Lord&#x27;s willing and the Creeks don&#x27;t rise like we used to say down in Louisiana in about a year or less we hope to present the proof of everything I&#x27;m saying in livid breathing Technicolor so without any further Ado if we can get the mechanical part going we will start to talk about what happened to this magic unified field theory that was the original theory of James Clerk Maxwell Maxwell&#x27;s original theory is no longer taught in Western universities hasn&#x27;t really been taught since 1900 instead the work of a single man who quote translated unquote Maxwell&#x27;s work into the modern version of vector analysis Jame U Oliver heavyside is what is taught as Maxwell&#x27;s Theory it is a subset of Maxwell&#x27;s theory that is taught today and specifically is it it is that subset which only applies when there is no interaction whatsoever between the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field we&#x27;re going to show you the other part that got left out first of all the original Theory the first paper that Maxwell wrote was written in 1864 during the time of the American Civil War it was a unified field Theory it did contain a an engineerable and workable and experimental theory of gravity but very few people recognized it for what it was Maxwell recognized it as the stress of space but didn&#x27;t understand that he had also grabbed a hold of gravity itself and so because it was written in querian Vector analysis not having been invented yet or finished it was written in the mathematics that was quite difficult to calculate in and one which had very bizarre appearances of minus signs when intuition said there shouldn&#x27;t be one there and one which was devilishly difficult to calculate in one which most scientists found quite distasteful a quoran differs from the present modern Vector in that in addition to the three Vector components you have a scalar component for example let us take a vector a obviously the vector a today in a little normal sophomore physics we&#x27;ll start out with a subi or AI plus BJ plus c k where I J and K are un vectors orthogonal to each other if we take such a vector for example and we cross it with itself we will produce a zero Vector resultant now I want to stop right there let me say that again rigorously we will produce a zero Vector resultant now the two vectors didn&#x27;t go anywhere they&#x27;re still acting upon each other they still there so very rigorously what we produce is a zero Vector system that is a system of acting vectors which sums to a zero resultant Vector for translation on the bottom we show the same situation in quaternion the Quan is expressed very similar to the vector except it has this little scalar term W sitting in there with one big difference when I cross for example Q Quan with itself I do not get just a zero Vector the vector part still goes to the zero Vector resultant but now I have suddenly the emergence of a scaler part which did not go away and the Scala part it turns out is in fact a function of the vectors that entered into the interaction notice on the bottom line that the cross product now is the square of the amplitude of one of the vectors that&#x27;s the urgency or the energy of the urgency of one vector on the other stress wise and I&#x27;ve retained the zero Vector because now we have to learn to read that exactly which is what heavyside did not do what this equation says and says very rigorously is is this if these are two electromagnetic vectors or quion we started with suppose they are the E fields and the two e fields for example the two e vectors are identical and we have an operation that&#x27;s making the cross product suppose that&#x27;s what&#x27;s actually going on what the bottom equation rigorously says is electromagnetically you have a zero Vector resultant with the system of two vectors still inside the zero Vector system and still acting produce ing the action a s now a s is proportional to the energy of one of the vectors the amplitude energy the urgency so to speak energetic urgency of one vector on the other so we&#x27;ve captured a form of stress and now suppose for example we&#x27;re instead of dealing with static vectors we&#x27;re dealing with actual sine waves again our Q cross Q is going to be a^2 + the zero Vector resultant electromagnetically I&#x27;ve got to say all that because I must not throw the zero Vector away it&#x27;s a real thing it&#x27;s a vacuum engine as a matter of fact it is not a zero except electromagnetically but it&#x27;s doing something else in the vacuum suppose Q is of the form Q is equal to a sin Omega T standard kind of wave simple sine wave type entity then C Q cross Q will give you a^ 2 sin^2 Omega t plus this zero Vector how do you read that the way you read that equation rigorously you don&#x27;t throw the zero Vector away it&#x27;s telling you something it says I have a zero Vector electromagnetic system whose active internal structure is giving me a scalar wave a^ 2 sin^2 Omega T that&#x27;s precisely what that equation says now when you threw away the querian scalar part you threw away the scalar wave and notice that in the scalar wave the energy which is proportional to the a squ is rhythmically varying if the energy density of the local vacuum where this action is occurring is is rhythmically varying then rigorously that is the definition of a local gravitational wave and there is your precise definition or derivation of scaler electromagnetics I will say one thing in passing and go on without further explanation because it takes a long time to explain it that particular wave the S squared wave scal W is most useful indeed in electrom magnetic healing it has the unique characteristic if you will break that wave out and look at it on your little graph plots it has a most unique characteristic that almost no other wave has a very weak wave of that exact configuration will instantly spread throughout the whole body through the bone cells through the marrow cells everywhere it won&#x27;t miss a single thing okay let&#x27;s take a look now for we&#x27;re not going to get too technical here I just want to give you the concepts and the ideas and the mathematics we can all manipulate later actually I&#x27;m not the only person in this room who&#x27;s working in this area by far I&#x27;d particularly like to mention the work the very important work of Dr Henry Monty who as far as I know independently discovered the same thing because on a telephone conversation he was telling me about it and I was telling him about it at EX exactly the same time and Dr Monte has already gone much further than we&#x27;ll go into tonight on the mathematics of the whole area I expect probably that the full theory of scalar electromagnetics will probably eventually be written by Dr Henry Monte now what can you do with an electron well you can push the thing straight away you can produce a field that&#x27;ll do that that&#x27;s what we call an e field you translate the electron straight away or the charge that&#x27;s the definition of an e field another thing you can do is you can produce a field which will cause the electron to interact with it and swirl around in a little swirl that is technically what we call a magnetic field a D field there&#x27;s one other thing you can do suppose you do not move the electron at all but you have a zero Vector electromagnetic system remember now I&#x27;ve got to say some extra words I can&#x27;t just throw away the zero Vector I&#x27;ve got to go after the gravity that&#x27;s left when it&#x27;s there if I have a zero Vector electromagnetic system it&#x27;s a stress system as I show on the bottom diagram suppose all of those vectors are rhythmically varying like a s squared or a sine wave I have then a scalar wave and all that it does it squeezes the electron can we not easily imagine taking a rubber ball between the outstretched fingers of both hands and rhythmically squeezing it and relaxing squeezing and relaxing that is a scalea away specifically it does not translate the particle neither does it swirl the particle it merely squeezes it so it does not give you an electron wiggle and electron wiggle detectors will not detect it because they detect translation Fields e fields or swirl Fields be Fields they do not detect squeeze waves as a matter of fact that squeeze W squeeze wave doesn&#x27;t do much to the electrons in the shells and the orbits around an atom it goes through and is absorbed and interacts with the nucleus as we&#x27;ll see later to show you that indeed Maxwell knew that he had captured the stress the medium now remember he wrote a theory based on a mechanical ether The Ether was a thin material uh thin ethereal material in his model so when he says a stress in the medium he means a stress in The Ether and he knew about that and here&#x27;s a direct quote which you can read from the chart directly from Maxwell himself here is the finish of the quote again directly from James Clerk Maxwell so Maxwell himself realized that he had also captured the local stress of the medium in his full Theory what is really pathetic is they didn&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s what gravity was stress in the medium is what gravity is so that&#x27;s very interesting way to think about it stress in the medium is gravity you need a ather ether to explain this the electron can either move directionally electric force it can can spin magnetic force or if it&#x27;s sitting there stationary it&#x27;s not really stationary there&#x27;s a stress like a stress ball it&#x27;s interesting way to think about it so Maxwell had written what really was a unified field theory of electromagnetism and gravitation in quaternium because he had captured the stress or the squeeze wave in the local vacuum the fluctuation or the variation controlled variation in the local energy density of the vacuum heavy side later on in fact after Maxwell&#x27;s death was one of the two men that finished what today we call Vector analysis heavyd and Gibbs now heavy side&#x27;s solution to the formidable and teeth nashing problem of calculation with Quan said the real problem is you&#x27;re mixing apples and orang oranges and so what we got to do is get rid of the scaler component and he just saw it off and threw it away one single human being all Heavy s did that nobody else not a team of scientists not a board of peerreview one guy remember there are very few scientists at this time probably there were some 30 or 40 scientists in the world in the Western World struggling with electromagnetics at the time that&#x27;s about all you had not many there was a short debate then remember Maxwell is long dead the Quan this were pointing out that you have not captured the complete Theory and the vector were saying yeah but boy can we calculate we can out calculate you all day long now this is simple it&#x27;s easy to understand we got it they had a short debate most of the action occurred in the journal Nature they simply buried the Quist that&#x27;s all there was to it and by 1900 you couldn&#x27;t even find quaran Theory being taught anymore everything was now heavy sided version of electromagnetic Theory now what happens when you throw out the squeeze wave when you throw out the scalar component of the quantum you throw out the component that caught the interaction and interplay between electromagnetics and gravity now this caused Albert Einstein to make a most serious and Grave restriction and today we would call it an error on general relativity because Einstein studied Oliver heavyside version of electromagnetic Theory so real quick history lesson right there was that Maxwell had 20 equations the heavyside Oliver heavy side came in he simplified them and then the people that were looking at analysis said well we like this better because we can calculate it makes more sense but that&#x27;s not how science Works science is this study of observable reality the equations don&#x27;t determine what&#x27;s real reality determines what&#x27;s real and then we have to do the equations for it so we oversimplified the equations by oversimplifying the equations this is how we&#x27;ve limited our understanding of gravity and how to manipulate it and in that theory you do not and cannot have electromagnetic curvature of space time let&#x27;s reason together ladies and Gentlemen let&#x27;s make this as simple as possible what does a normal Garden variety heavys side electromagnetic wave do it gets the hell out of there at the speed of light it does not stay around and oscillate the energy density of vacuum BL and it&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s a fastest thing in the universe that&#x27;s a material type thing but what does a squeeze wave doing which is sitting in position and squeezing it sits there and it oscillates the energy density of the local vacuum the gravitational wave is what it is it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere it doesn&#x27;t take off at the speed of light it&#x27;s sitting in place it&#x27;s all locked together as a single system with a zero Vector translation or get to hell out of there result so Einstein then not knowing any way that you can curve electromagnetic uh curve local SpaceTime electromagnetically and by the way all curvature SpaceTime means that&#x27;s a simple thing imagine that space is filled with little fantastically dense and intense spray all the time called a virtual particle flux the only problem is each little particle doesn&#x27;t stay around it&#x27;s instantly born almost instantly dies so it&#x27;s like a gas that&#x27;s continually each particle being continually created and annihilated so it&#x27;s a crazy kind of gas flux that we&#x27;re looking at that&#x27;s really the modern view of the vacuum then all we&#x27;re talking about is the intensity of that flux is oscillating that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re talking about only we polarize the internal pattern of it we can put patterns in it that&#x27;s what the stress wave of the scalar M wave is Einstein then said the only other thing left to curve local SpaceTime is this very weak gravitational force which is some 10- 42 times weaker down in the grass from where the force the electromagnetic force field the electric field is between two electrons now that&#x27;s very weak 10 to Theus 42 is a very small fraction you can&#x27;t find that you can&#x27;t even measure it with normal instruments with except great with great difficulty so he reasoned then that that&#x27;s so far down in the grass you&#x27;re never going to be able to measure any kind of local SpaceTime curvature from that from the electrical stuff going on he also reason that such a thing that you could measure could only result from a huge collection of mass like the sun of a great star or something like that well the laboratory and the instruments and the Observer and the researcher is not going to be sitting on the surface of the sun it&#x27;s a little bit hot so he said therefore where you the local Observer is where the lab is where the instruments are there will be no local curvature SpaceTime so he assumed because of that that the local SpaceTime is never curved now all you energy Buffs clean out your ears and open them up wake up and listen when you make that assumption the local SpaceTime has never curved it gives you the rench frame all that nonsense you now save and cause to be applied rigorously every conservation law in that system you cannot escape the conservation of energy you&#x27;re not going to get any energy from SpaceTime it&#x27;s all going to run right back in there that you get out of there you&#x27;re going to lose it so forget any kind of a free energy device where you&#x27;re trying to build a Paddle Wheel in the special River as long as that Assumption of Einstein holds now if you were to curve local SpaceTime the Russians have long since remove that restriction from general relativity that they teach in the Western World you can&#x27;t get such a paper published in the western literature many good physicists have tried if you curve local SpaceTime and this is absolutely rigorous Russian work check the leading journals and the leading academicians all I hope you heard that word all conservation laws go out the window there are no irre aable conservation laws when you have local curvature SpaceTime and that&#x27;s the thing the conition that Oliver heavyside threw out of James clerk Maxwell&#x27;s original theory he threw out the baby with a bath water but he made it a hell of a lot easier to calculate and understand so people began to understand it began to be able to calculate be began to build instruments and make great advances but meanwhile we had a severely crippling assumption made for Good Reason by Albert Einstein on general relativity and the irony of all ironies for the rest of his life Einstein was in a Vain and desperate search trying to find out how in the world to get electromagnetics back in there and he never succeeded not realizing that that little bitty assumption meant you could never do it if he had changed that one single assumption he had it all and if he had studied Maxwell&#x27;s original quaternium theory he would probably have not made the Assumption and you would be flying anti-gravity spaceships all over the Solar System since about 1904 that&#x27;s a bold claim okay we have a new breed of cat now the scaler EM wave it&#x27;s rigorous you can mathematically derive it you can try it out on the LA bench and it works but it works quite different from normal electromagnetic waves so all you electrical boys got to remember now you got to learn some new phenomenology they didn&#x27;t teach you this one in electrical engineering and if you look at circuits that work this way you electrical boy you got some electrical boys out there and you insist you&#x27;re going to look at them with electrical engineering eyes you&#x27;re going to go home thinking that that can&#x27;t possibly work and it&#x27;s all nonsense and you will never never be able to build such circuitry and such devices you&#x27;ve got to learn to think in a different manner the first place this wave goes right straight through the electron shells goes down the nucleus well we&#x27;re going to tamper with something very fundamental here let&#x27;s ask a very fundamental question what is this physical reality around us how is it made everything is made from potentials according to Quantum Mechanics the most modern Theory my operators forget your force fields your e field and your B field that secondary junk that comes after the operator works on the potentials the potentials are gravitational fields gravitational potentials all potentials are but this normal thing you studied as the normal electromagnetic wave the E field and the B field component normally reacts with the electron shells of atoms with negative charges why because all the atoms got the electrical charges negative around them in their electron shells the whole world is built that way now the electron shells can go bananas lot of interaction the average nucleus is several hundred thousand times more massive than one electron which interacts with one photon so the big old nucleus just sort of shakes a little bit in most cases and that&#x27;s it so large Assemblies of nuclei of atoms normally very stable in this first order reality stuff physical reality as you normally see it you&#x27;re looking with electron wiggle detectors from your physical system and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re seeing Photon interaction with electron shells of atoms and so the world is very stable and all of the people people first start off thinking that become materialists they think everything material is real and that&#x27;s it and that&#x27;s Ultimate Reality and a lot of them are willing to kill you under certain dogmatic systems to enforce that belief kill you in order to enforce that belief all you see is reality and that&#x27;s it wow that&#x27;s a little scary and nothing could be further from the truth that is a first order truth but it is not ultimate truth this thing is real but it&#x27;s not ultimately the only reality if you go down into the nucleus now and you really hit the nucleus if the nucleus moves everything goes bananas and the stable order that you observe around you goes right out the window and when you go in with the Scala waves that&#x27;s the kind of reality you&#x27;re looking at wow okay let&#x27;s talk about the time because we&#x27;re going to tamper with that too I told you this part gets a little complicated but I&#x27;m going to try to show you before you get out of here how to think about a time reverse wave and how to use it and how to make it work for you and do magic now a photon comes in and interacts with a negative charge and that and then the charge goes into excited state going around the atom and then drops back and decays and emits a photon that process of photon absorption and emission reemission from the excited state of a negative charge in an atom is what we call the positive flow of time now let&#x27;s be rigorous here we&#x27;re saying that the flow of time in this universe occurs bit by bit at a fantastically High Rate One near piece at a time delta T is not always the same size it is discreet but it is not the same size so watch you words you got to think very carefully cronon do not exist not as being one simple value it&#x27;s discret but it&#x27;s quite variable as we&#x27;ll find later if that same Photon interacts with a positive charge we already know in physics that if you invert the charge you invert time that may surprise you but it&#x27;s well known in physics that is not Tom Bearden and so it gives you a little piece of negative time hey wait a minute we got a problem here they use a theorem in particle physics they found out the charge is not conserved broken symmetry parot is not conserved time itself is not conserved but it seems that the three the product of the three all three cannot be violated at one time that&#x27;s the best shot we got at it today in particle physics that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re at but you can violate any two or one let me say that again you don&#x27;t have to concern charge the contrary argument is but it&#x27;s a little effect you say yeah baby it&#x27;s a little white crow but maybe he&#x27;ll grow if I can have little white crows and I can collect them and grow them I&#x27;ll have big white crows in the makeer world so charge paret time if you inverse the thing you might get something different as a matter of fact the antiphoton which has been assumed to be the same as a photon that is a false assumption in physics and I&#x27;ll show you that in just a moment well we&#x27;ve already said we go into the nucleus with scaler waves and we&#x27;ll have a higher order reality when we do that why first place we&#x27;re interacting with a neg a positive charge the nucleus of an atom is already time inverted did they forget to tell you that in your electrical class yeah because they didn&#x27;t know that but it&#x27;s true and modern physics substantiates it and we&#x27;re going to find out that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re going to get time revers waves a little later on that we can use to do all sorts of magic things at this point then if you go into the nucleus although I show here on this diagram little balls all clustered together modern physics tells us that&#x27;s not the way the nucleus is built at all it&#x27;s a vast boiling smear there&#x27;s not a proton there&#x27;s not a neutron all that mess in it at all if you go in there and you catch one and you gradually catch all the wiggling fish and bring them out that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll find on the average after you stop the fish but before you stop them they&#x27;re waves they are not particles they&#x27;re all mixed up as a big mess so you can&#x27;t separate them it&#x27;s a boiling mess in fact it&#x27;s a trapped local potential which means it&#x27;s gravitational that&#x27;s what mass is that&#x27;s modern physics not Tom beon but now if I can go in and have a wave absorbed directly in that the scale wave I just either increase or I can decrease depending on how I Biance that potential wave that I send in there and I can raise that potential low it at will as a matter of fact if I keep radiating it and absorbed in there it&#x27;ll keep building up it charges up just like a capacitor only now it&#x27;ll charge either positive or negative and I&#x27;m giving you laboratory results it acts as a capacitance for scal WS now when something else comes in there and hits it another wave it&#x27;ll trigger the thing it&#x27;ll collapse and out it&#x27;ll come another wave out of the nucleus there&#x27;ll be a time reverse wave and all the nuclei in the universe are continually exchanging scaler waves I don&#x27;t have time to go into this aspect but I will say with a fourth law of logic which I built many years ago and proved I published a proof for it I don&#x27;t have to worry about can it be proved I can demonstrate it in less than 10 seconds the fourth law of logic tells us ultimately you can only model a thing in terms of its direct opposite it&#x27;s not geometry the modeling of the presence of mass in terms terms of the absence of mass you see my point in this case we&#x27;re going to have to learn a little bit of that in our modeling Theory and we&#x27;ll go into that in just a moment but when we go into the nucleus now in this boiling mess and we can actually adjust the potential we can even put patterns remember we put fingers structure inside this Scala wave it&#x27;s got a structure we can build any kind of zero system different systems and patterns and polarizations inside there in the virtual state of vacuum that we wish to we can go notice he did a triangle formation right there for a zero State he was talking about zero point system let&#x27;s look at that real quick again M and we can actually adjust the potential we can even put patterns remember we put fingers structure inside this Scala wave it&#x27;s got a structure we can build any kind of zero system hello 3145 there is your answer to MH370 videos right there chat you&#x27;re looking at it we adjust the potential we can even put patterns remember we put fingers structure inside this Scala wave it&#x27;s got a structure we can build any kind of zero system different systems and patterns and polarizations inside there in the virtual state of vacuum that we wish to we can go into that nucleus and it&#x27;s boiling away it&#x27;s just like a cathode you put a little signal in there you put a matrix that thing will organize you know about Progene you know about self organizations of Highly nonlinear systems far from thermonuclear uh thermal equilibrium that thing is as far as you can get from thermal equilibrium it&#x27;s in a violent exchange with the vacuum itself pH cancel I just screwed up chat I AC clicked when I didn&#x27;t want to a violent exchange with a vacuum so he just me he mentioned ELO Ela pran we&#x27;re gonna have to look at that um self-organizing systems Matrix that thing will organize you know about pre you know about self-organizations of Highly nonlinear systems power from thermonuclear okay so this is big because breaking through the swinger limit is creating a nonlinear system that&#x27;s what breaking through the swinger limit means in terms of getting energy densities high enough to break through the Sher limit means making a nonlinear system then that&#x27;s going to lead us to El Progene which I have that paper in the background here somewhere thermal equilibrium that thing is as far as you can get from thermal equilibrium it&#x27;s in a violent exchange so scaler wave is far as away you can get from thermal equilibrium interesting with the vacuum itself virtual particle exchange it&#x27;s a Progene system first class and that thing will self-organize according to the pattern you put in it I&#x27;ve just told you how to do transmutation of elements between isomers is very simple a man was nominated for the Nobel Prize kve in 1977 for proving conclusively the living systems with micro can transmute elements to a limited extent chickens do it we do it okay wow I don&#x27;t know if you guys are paying attention on that but he just described the thunderstorm generator and Bob greener&#x27;s work cuz your system can be arranged in different shapes so potentially Malcolm Bendle figured one out from the double spheric IAL Whatchamacallit modules that he has on on the vortex generator so maybe that&#x27;s what the letter to me was talking about again sacred geometry zero point shapes um and shapes that are potentially creating uh gravitational scalar potentials wow I feel like we&#x27;ve figured something out herey everything does it a little bit the average biologist still hasn&#x27;t heard of that and doesn&#x27;t believe it when you telling but it is a fact and it was replicated and that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done the living system can generate and has these Electro gravitational waves these squeeze waves these scalar EM waves the part that heavyside left out living systems have generated since the beginning of time it&#x27;s very weak as far as power goes but if you keep right on pouring it into the nucleus you can change the nucleus the nucleus will order and change and charge up with that pattern that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done and it&#x27;s fairly simple to be done between isomers of the elements of the Isotopes general relativity includes theine geometry now apply because when you go into the nucleus you&#x27;ve moved into higher Dimensions how many as many as you wish but you&#x27;ve got to have at least five Dimensions to capture a unified field theory of gravity and electromagnetics now when heavy sign throughout the scaler component before 1900 it meant that somebody could come along now for special relativity and put it in four dimensions but did he have electromagnetics in there uh-uh no you can&#x27;t really fit electromagnetics correctly and have gravity in there too in four dimensions if you have a four-dimensional theory of electromagnetics you ain&#x27;t got gravity if you&#x27;ve got gravity in there you ain&#x27;t got electromagnetics it won&#x27;t fit but if you have 1/ Dimension which Kusa did in 1920s you can unify again electromagnetics and gravity his paper was published on the recommendation of Albert Einstein so now we must have kusine at least five-dimensional geometry by the way Kuser showed that where the extra Dimension went you could model it it wrapped around each point in our three space now in that model electromagnetic waves do not travel through three space rigorously they Slither around the little surfaces around every point in three space along their direction of travel that&#x27;s a quite important distinction if they penetrate the point that&#x27;s gravity if they slip and Slither around it in The Fifth Dimension that&#x27;s electromagnetics and that&#x27;s Kusa Klein Theory not Tom beard they just don&#x27;t make it quite that simple and clear what do we got here guess we got a space now in the past I&#x27;ve given you a piece of information because I didn&#x27;t want you to hurt yourself I gave you spatial opposition of positive energy positive time wavs and those are very weak you get very weak gravitational effects and very weak inertial effects you won&#x27;t kill anybody with that you won&#x27;t kill yourself but this one is powerful specifically it can be 9 * 10 16 times as powerful you you make a Time reversed wave which we&#x27;re going to go into with a full explanation here you&#x27;re going to get to full treatment tonight I&#x27;m not going to cut it short if you get tired just go if you want to get it stay because I&#x27;m going to make it real simple but if you take a normal wave which I&#x27;ve shown this little sign wave here one oscillation and you make its time reversed or time reversed replica it&#x27;s exactly like it in space it fits exactly with it spatially but the time Dimension is reversed now the stress of those two waves that they&#x27;re locked together is totally on time Dimension that&#x27;s a highly compacted space Dimension and you get one going up one coming back so you get a c squ type factor out of this thing that gravitational wave and that&#x27;s what it is that scalar wave can be up to 9 * 10 16th times as strong as the one I&#x27;ve told you about in the past and this is the one you do if you want to do Antigravity you got your ears open you listening all you have to do to do gravity all you want in any University laboratory in this country is make a pumped phase conjugate mirror at 100 to 400 Hertz let me say that again and I&#x27;m not going to answer any questions on it all you have to do if you want to make all the anti-gravity you wish to make and any University laboratory in this country can do it it&#x27;s simple doesn&#x27;t take much power is make a pumped phase conjugate mirror between 100 and 400 Herz enough said Okay a photon is a piece of energy and a piece of time weld together no in the middle piece of what we call Action which has the dimensions of angular momentum we usually show that as Plank&#x27;s constant H aha H is always positive you got to have something called a brick call Action but the brick can be made two ways and still be positive you can make it with a piece of positive energy and a piece of positive time you well together and the product is still positive you can make it with negative energy and negative time and it&#x27;s still positive now the first one is a photon and that&#x27;s something that comes off of interaction with a negative charge and it&#x27;ll give you positive time interaction as it continues it&#x27;ll also give you entropy because that will tend to more and more disorder and the law of entropy the second law of thermodynamics ruthlessly applies now what&#x27;s the Assumption in that law your professor never told you it had assumption because he didn&#x27;t know it the assumption is it&#x27;s only for positive time Critters it does not apply to negative time Critters the negative of the law applies for negative time Critters it backs up instead of tending to more and more disorder it tends back to order so don&#x27;t you worry about the Universe running down it&#x27;s running back up to order just as fast as it runs down to disorder but in negative time but the internal part of every atom is already filled with time reversed Critters now the energy of an atom of a photon rather is e equal H new where new is the frequency let&#x27;s reason together here why did I say we got plenty of people making pump phasee conjugate mirrors and these guys don&#x27;t ever see any gravity why I just told you you can do it that way am I a fool or did they miss something if you understand that equation is it not true if H retains a fixed size it can&#x27;t vary in size if I have a big Delta e I&#x27;m going to have a little delta T magnitude of if negative Delta e is big in magnitude then negative delta T is small in magnitude they are canonical variables well if you&#x27;ve got high frequency by the bottom formula you&#x27;ve got lots of energy in a photon you got very little time change in it so high energy photons high frequency photons are not going to have very much negative times even when they&#x27;re anti photons they&#x27;ll have very little and anti-gravity depends on negative time let&#x27;s us reason together if in positive time the Assumption in Newton&#x27;s craz low gravitational law attraction of mass what&#x27;s the Assumption positive time anybody ever tell you that no because they never thought of it but if you reverse the time do you not back up the situation does now Mass not repel and we have just told you you can go into the nucleus and start charging the nucleus with a pattern including negative time we have just told you that you had to lose use low frequency why cuz you want a big delta T you don&#x27;t want a big Delta e Delta e gets in your way it tears you up so the Optics boys never see this that is so far in the grass you can&#x27;t even measure it where they&#x27;re at they never thought about doing it at 400 HZ you go home and try it in your laboratory and then sit on the side laughing for the next two 2 3 hours and how silly we all been for years and how easy it is to do it I will tell you if you pursue that you can take a flashlight battery and levitate a battleship and I will not discuss that further you can take a flashlight battery and you can levitate a battleship okay first of all Philadelphia Experiment second of all what you can use a tiny amount of energy so what he&#x27;s saying there is that you can essent extract free energy and it doesn&#x27;t even take that much energy to pull this off a battery could levitate a battleship cuz then you&#x27;re going to ask me about The Philadelphia Experiment and I&#x27;m going to tell you I don&#x27;t know anything about that once in a while I got to lie a little bit once in a while I got to lie a little bit once in a while I got a lie a little bit I will tell you if you pursue that you can take a flashlight battery and levitate a battleship and I will not discuss that further cuz then you&#x27;re going to ask me about The Philadelphia Experiment and I&#x27;m going to tell you I don&#x27;t know anything about that once in a while you got to lie a little bit unfortunately okay as Delta e goes up delta T goes down the magnitude the absolute value we&#x27;re going to be interested when we talk about gravitational inertial effects things like that we&#x27;re going to be interested in big pieces of negative time low frequency photons stay away from the Optics boys they&#x27;re in the wrong regime they&#x27;re doing good work but they&#x27;re in the wrong regime let&#x27;s see then what happened further with some of this well comes along the greatest electrical Genius of all time Nicola Tesla what does Tesla do he discovers the scaler EM wave he called it his standing Coler wave let&#x27;s run that by again standing Coler wave does it make sense now a squeeze wave which stands in place he discovered that out in Colorado Springs before 1900 he has such a rapid progression of his understanding of this and his development of material he also discussed time reversal we&#x27;ll get into that later he found that out he started building on Long Island a situation to power the whole world and tonight I&#x27;m going to explain to you precisely and exactly how that works and I&#x27;m going to tell you there&#x27;s a thousand papers in the literature that prove the fundamental mechanism works and if you believe you can get that mechanism in the earth and you have just shown that it will work well direct put in time reversal he didn&#x27;t predict a positron he predict he predicted a Time reversed electron and lo and behold they looked around and they discovered the critter so all of a sudden we had time reversal in physics only we reversed the whole particle nobody&#x27;s doing the photon now because they said well you time reverse Photon wiggle this way or wiggle back that way still looks like a sign which same thing and they missed it right there glusa Cline Theory came along in the 20s after general relativity had come along we talked about gravity and anti-gravity were worked out based on only the attraction of mass electromagnetic is left out that&#x27;s the missing ingredient everybody&#x27;s hunting for how to get it back in Einstein failed in his vigorous search for it the rest of his life and the reason was they didn&#x27;t worry about negative energy and they didn&#x27;t worry about negative time how many physicists have thundered about the second law of Thermodynamics and not a damn one of them has realized that it assumes positive time only does not assume negative time time reversed Critters well a ma magic thing happened in World War II now we&#x27;re going to tell you some of the rest of the story that we haven&#x27;t told you before in World War II a funny thing happened radar came into being and everybody&#x27;s using radar like mad the German wolf Pikes were murdering the ships we put a radar in an airplane we found out you could track the Periscope when the ubot came stuck his eyes up to look when he put his snorkel up to breathe you could track a snorkel and all of a sudden we had a hunter killer team and we were bombing to living hell out of those OTS and the pride of the German Navy went to the bottom boom and one in a month went by they didn&#x27;t sink a single ship and they lost a hell of a lot of you boats cuz every time he looked Boom come greetings on his head this is true in an absolute Panic the Germans placed the finest brains and they had the finest brains in those days in Europe the finest mathematicians and the finest physicists and the finest brains on that problem they originated what today is really called rigorous radar cross-section Theory radar absorbing material they Advanced radar cross-section which is the heart of modern radar Theory and countermeasure Theory further According to some real radar expert friends of mine than we are today just a little further than we are today in the US and at the end of the war that entire team team went to the Soviet Union again let us reason together what do you do they coated by the way their snorkel with the ram material and they coated their periscopes and their they didn&#x27;t get any reflection back and so we couldn&#x27;t track them again they went right back to shooting down or torpedo in the ships okay let&#x27;s reason together again what do you do with the radar absorbing material it&#x27;s in the open literature you do something like carbon dope with various materials and what you do is you slow the wave down you can get at least a whole wavelength or the correct portion of the wavelength in there and what you do reflect back you get it out of phase cancel make make that zero Vector right electromagnetic zero Vector you don&#x27;t have no electromagnetic reflection they don&#x27;t wonder about it or try to detect it or have any to detect if it&#x27;s a gravitational reflection so it disappears off your radar still sitting there still absorbing the energy now you will find out later that when we absorb two waves in a nonlinear material 180° out of phase that&#x27;s called a pump wave and that&#x27;s the first thing you do to get to start to make Amplified phase conjugate waves you start to get anomalies when you radiate with another wave bang you get this big Amplified response Bo comes out of the material why where the devil did that come from not supposed to be there at all by electromagnetic Theory when you radiate such a material over multiple beams you have what today is called pumped phase conjugate four-wave mixing and you get amplification of the tickling wave and you get high amplification of it and you get it with a Time reversed wave as we&#x27;ll find out later I&#x27;ll show you how that works so the anomalies were there now in in Huntsville Alabama we have the head of the rocket team retired Dr Long Dr Long knew those members of the German radar team and he has confirmed they had anomalies but after all these years he doesn&#x27;t remember what it was he had his hands full with big Rockets we got the rocket team you see but it says that the Russians had those kind of anomalies that led the Pumped four-wave amplification of time reversed waves in radar at the end of World War II and by 1950 they built an operational Radars they&#x27;ve got the finest mathematicians and always had the finest nonlinear mathematicians on it and they started whole weapon system in radar by 1950 and they got it from the German radar team they did not start it in nonlinear Optics now we were not clever enough or smart enough to discover the time reversed electromagnetic wave after developing all the formidable weapons I&#x27;ve talked to you in the past about around 1969 70 or so the Russians cautiously released this stuff a paper showing the time reversed wave in the optical frequency why why in the optical frequency they didn&#x27;t want you to get any gravity hell if they&#x27; have released it at 400 Herz you had any gravity already so I didn&#x27;t want you to have that stay away from that go up there where it doesn&#x27;t harm anything gravitationally and see if we know about it we showed we didn&#x27;t nobody reacted so they sent a couple scientists down to lence Livermore laboratory and briefed them on it in 1972 this is time reversed waves and our guys with great El laity said OHA we me thinks there&#x27;s something here I&#x27;ve been hit over the head with a brick bat so they started vigorously working at it in nonlinear Optics it&#x27;s a general solution to the wave equation now we haven&#x27;t got the foggiest notion today what generates a Time reverse wave but boy do we know how to write an equation we take the wave equation write Aster in one term that&#x27;s it that&#x27;s all of it it writes a Time reverse wave so we think we understand it we can write the equation we can solve the equation and got the fish notion what causes it to be born but if it is it&#x27;ll follow that equation that&#x27;s where we are today we&#x27;re going to go further than that because you need skater electromagnetics go further so for the people in the chat when he was talking about radar he&#x27;s kind of he was talking about Stealth he was about getting the the radar beam to hit your object at the right wavelength where it gets completely canceled out and then nothing comes back so then you&#x27;re invisible so actually when people were talking about Stealth and cloaking that they&#x27;re talking about the same thing the concepts are interrelated they&#x27;re completely interrelated uh because that technology is what leads to gravity manipulation based on scaler physics wow couple of more technical thing then we get into Fun cartoons Philadelphia Experiment is probably true well the change is composed of action two canonical variables energy times time I just wanted to refresh your mind here and we can have either negative or positive now I want to show you how it works in cloa theory cloa Clin Theory everything comes in five Dimensions the potential is really in five Dimensions but this little old surface around every point in our SpaceTime as you shrink to a point does not the surface area vastly increase isn&#x27;t that the law that the surface area around the volume increases the smaller the thing gets by the time you get down to a point you got a real humongous surface area for electromagnetics to slip around and not have to penetrate the point so everything escapes electromagnetically real easy slips around a Fifth Dimension never penetrates never makes gravity so electron gets it and boogies out of there so most of the five Dimensions is normally bled off on the left as fast as you form the potential which is a five-dimensional pressure so to speak zip boom it&#x27;s gone in Fifth Dimension electromagnetics and that&#x27;s all there is to that so if you can force it to go into the 4dg field you got to first block this terrible Escape for example between two electrons only 10us 42 of it gets out as gravitational a penetrates the point but if you could block that arrow on the left and force a lot more of it to go over there into the actual three space that&#x27;s in our 4D manowski space then you get lots more gravity lots more inertial field that&#x27;s all you got to do to build a intial field generator but you got to block the M field how you going to do that well you do it real simple normally it goes boom out there as electromagnetics not much left as gravity a little bitty tiny hiss over on the side to make it Kitty cartoon but impress the point but if you block the escape&#x27;s electromagnetics block the big door you&#x27;ll get a big boom out over there and you get lots of inertia and lots of gravity and you can engineer that on the bench at real the great Cosmic engines of the universe operate inside Vector electromagnetic Vector zeros that&#x27;s where the gravitation is gravitation is infolded electromagnetic forces locked together with a zero e field and B field resultants electromagnetics is the outfolding of the locked in electromagnetic stress of the vacuum it&#x27;s all it is and by the way that&#x27;s rigorously in agreement with modern physics except we can have a structure to it whereas they normally have it as a random structure they don&#x27;t use the fact that you can deliberately do it because why heavyside taught him to throw away the zero electromagnetic Vector resultant because he had thrown away the gravity with that system okay to get distance effects we all know how to put photons through there and hit something out there at the distance or hit it with matter but the best way to do it is to do it with potentials not with force fields and photons and matter that&#x27;s potentials potentials were thought to be mathematical figments until quantum mechanics prove they are the real things and it&#x27;s the electromagnetics that&#x27;s a derivative and interference is what gives you everything and the potentials that&#x27;s the magic first you got to make potentials if you make these the zero Vector electromagnetic systems are artificial potentials they have an internal structure of stress but they have no gradient they&#x27;re not flowing out with a translation vector or a swell vector if you interfere two of those at the distance you recreate electromagnetic energy depending on how you bias the beams you create the thing higher than the normal energy so energy flows out of that interference Zone if you Bas it lower it&#x27;ll create energy lower so it&#x27;ll suck energy out of there and by the way it come right back down the beams back in your transmitter you better dump it somewhere but let&#x27;s look at some characteristics now of he just he just told us he just told us the answer um it is what it&#x27;s EX exactly what JK Philly fan said um four wave mixing interferometry listen very closely chat to what he just said the crazy part is that we can only know this is real because we&#x27;ve seen it on two videos and those two videos are 100% accurate scientifically to Thomas bearden&#x27;s uh physics that he&#x27;s been mentioning right here listen to the part where he says where does it go the question is right when you absorb the energy uh from this Vector uh potential here this Vector potential when you can either pump energy in or you can suck energy out so in our video we&#x27;re seeing an endothermic event an absorption of energy where does it go the answer is you be you don&#x27;t use two beams you use four beams three you have three orbs those are three beams that are shooting and then you have one fourth orb somewhere else which is creating the fourth uh uh what is it fourth wave mixing interferometer and this is an interferometry pattern right here and again like you said you can do it like this you can do it like this and then you can have another one where there&#x27;s a fourth one this is how Dave knew about the fourth one since you recreate electromagnetic energy depending on how you bi the beams you create the thing higher than the normal energy so energy flows out of that interference Zone if you Bas it lower it&#x27;ll create energy lower so it&#x27;ll suck energy out of there and by the way it come right back down the beams back in your transmitter you better dump it somewhere it it will come straight back down the beams and come into your transmitter so if you&#x27;re sucking it out it&#x27;s going to go right where the beams are at so you need a fourth orb that is basically the direction of travel and that energy is going to go to the fourth orb that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re all going to show up so energy flows out of that interference Zone if you bias it lower it&#x27;ll create energy lower so it&#x27;ll suck energy out of there and by the way it come right back down the beams back in your transmitter you better to dump it somewhere got to dump it somewhere let&#x27;s look at some characteristics now of time reversed waves because here&#x27;s where the real magic is this is the magic we&#x27;ve been looking for we go ahead it first like the nonlinear Optics boys if you have a piece of plastic that&#x27;s nonlinear hunk of junk 10cent piece and coming in from the left over here is the dotted line a wave front that I show is E1 it comes in and it strikes this nonlinear medium and it travels on through it and it starts break getting distorted as it goes through the ra wave front starts getting distorted because it&#x27;s a nonlinear distorting medium it comes out the other side and you see it&#x27;s now all Wiggly and distorted but another magic thing happens which we didn&#x27;t know we had to Discover It mil Soviet literature and then they had to kick us in the ankles to get our attention to make us realize what they&#x27;d said then we went to work on it the medium also generates a second wave that&#x27;s a Time reversed wave E2 that now appears spatially in Phase everywhere that other wave appears forward backwards everywhere else it&#x27;s normally a very weak thing we&#x27;ll find out you can amplify it real easy but it is totally and exactly and precisely in Phase it has an invisible trace of where this other wave came from and where it&#x27;s going and it boogies out of there to appear right in that exact same place in space but in time it&#x27;s reversed it&#x27;s a stress in time the two together will form a real good gravitational wave if they&#x27;re equal spatially they don&#x27;t know that in Optics because at the wrong frequency they never see the gravity aspects they don&#x27;t have it in Optics this is a quote right out of a standard textbook that says the same thing the diagram said and I won&#x27;t bother to let you read the thing it&#x27;s it says exactly the same only very technical okay let&#x27;s amplify the thing we take our same piece uh plastic material hunk of junk we&#x27;ll put in a wave A2 and a wave A1 normal nice Garden variety electromagnetic waves nice little sign wave let&#x27;s play like but we put them in so they&#x27;re in the medium and 180° that sounded like that Ram material didn&#x27;t it only now I&#x27;m working at Optics just wanted to point that out and passing and so now in the medium what do we have it is it not a nonlinear medium all your electrical engineers is that not a modulator let&#x27;s hear it yes it locks the two waves together they don&#x27;t just mix and run through one another they become one system you got to have a zero Vector locked in modulated system not mixed wavs mixing don&#x27;t do it it&#x27;s got to be modulated got to be a nonlinear medium okay waves A1 and A2 spatially 180 out of phase now do they not lock together and form a zero Vector resultant e field and B field yes they do is that not a Scala wave now you can argue a little bit if you want to about what happens to magnetic field if that bothers you so it&#x27;s going to shift 90° forget it just stay with the E field the point is you can make a scaler wave and it will go now into into the nucleus and they call the combination of those two waves the pump wave and what are you pumping the nuclei of the atoms in the material what are you doing to the nuclei of the atoms in the material you&#x27;re charging them up to a higher or lower potential in excited state as the case may be doesn&#x27;t matter and here you go and then suppose you come in here with a little weak A4 wave these are the numbers that they use A1 and A2 is a pump A4 is the input this thing operates like a triode A1 and A2 the pump wave makes the nucleus a cathode A3 go uh A4 goes in on the grid A3 comes out as if it were a signal coming off the plate and you can have all the energy in A3 that you up to what you&#x27;ve got in A1 and A2 and A3 is time reversed which means what it means wherever A4 came from in the universe out there from some distant point this thing has a memory and it takes off booing through space precisely fitting the path that A4 took all the way back to that point be at six holy crap chat he just explained teleportation so the pump wave would presumably be from the fourth orb it sounds like and then that&#x27;s going to descend it strapes the plane straight back to the fourth orb am I understand that correctly chat wow and A3 is time reversed which means what it means wherever a came from in the universe out there from some distant point this thing has a memory and it takes off booing through space precisely fitting the path that A4 took all the way back to that point be at 6 ft in the laboratory be it 6,000 M away or 600,000 mi in the perfect case if that&#x27;s an over the horizon radar signal A3 boogies back up did he just say Over the Horizon radar what year was this the 80s he just said over Horizon radar precisely fitting the path that A4 took all the way back to that point be at 6 ft in the laboratory be at 6,000 mil away or 600,000 miles in the perfect case if that&#x27;s an over the horizon radar signal A3 Boogie back up to where it bounced off the ionosphere boogies on back over to where we tracked a rising rocket whoa we can use Over the Horizon radar on that okay we&#x27;re going to listen to it one more time I I think that was just I think we just hit the jackpot the answer is four wve mixing interferometry maybe you can even do five wave mixing I don&#x27;t know maybe you have three orbs and then you really have five waves where the fourth orb is pumping uh in the energy into the the three orb system and then that you get a reverse time reversed wave going back towards the fourth orb means what it means wherever A4 came from in the universe out there from some distant point this thing has a memory and it takes off booing through space precisely fitting the path that A4 took all the way back to that point be at 6 ft in the laboratory be it 6,000 mil away or 600,000 mil in the perfect case if that&#x27;s an over the horizon radar signal A3 boogies back up to where it bounced off the ionosphere boogies on back over to where we tracked a rising rocket like the Delta rocket in 86 talking about challeng if I am popping a pulse suppose I put 100 megaw do it whatever you want to in A1 and A2 in a pump wave I can get out up to a 100 megaw in wave A3 do you see that everybody understand that boom out comes 100 megaw in A3 in the oscillation condition A3 100 megaw now backs up it does spatially the exact thing different from a normal wave it converges along its Trail not diverges all of the power goes right back the trail right into the missile if it&#x27;s slowly rising and if you&#x27;re 150 ft over to the side of the missile you won&#x27;t see anything you will think it originated inside the missile and so the Delta rocket died with two mysterious surges of power in it that cut the damn booster off and they had to destroy it that&#x27;s exactly what destroyed it right there we&#x27;ll talk about some other things later now do you see that this thing is useful for weapons if you understand conjugation you can design yourself every weapon I have in fedy Lance and the words phase conjugation do not appear in the book by Design not by accident and I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been beaten up verbally and abused by physicists and Engineers who didn&#x27;t know what the hell they were talking about and they didn&#x27;t have the foggiest uh understanding of time reversed wave now let&#x27;s lay one issue to rest the average physicist who knows about this in the face of a thousand papers already in the you&#x27;re proving this experimentally and everything else theoretically does not believe it&#x27;s a Time reversed way Jack you hear that Jack he&#x27;s talking to you Tom beard is talking to Jack from the past maybe this is the phone call that Jack got maybe he&#x27;s getting one right now he doesn&#x27;t even realized it Tom Bearden was speaking to the Future here proof is right here guys literally telling Jack he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about for Jack sarfati physicists don&#x27;t understand this uh only Engineers do even though we&#x27;ve described the characteristics oh well it&#x27;s a wfront reversal we prefer to say you can&#x27;t go backwards in time you can&#x27;t go into the past immediately he reveals his ignorance let&#x27;s reason together I said this wave was time reversed did I say that every single particle of mass in the whole cotton picking Universe was time reversed and backed up to a previous state of the universe which is what the past would be nobody said any such thing the theory doesn&#x27;t predict any such thing and if he thinks that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying he doesn&#x27;t understand time reversal and he doesn&#x27;t understand wow wow what a revelation he just explained why it doesn&#x27;t allow you to go to the Past you cannot travel to the past with this because it&#x27;s not that every particle in the universe is time reversed it&#x27;s just the area around the object itself even the particles within the object if you make a bubble around it even the particles within it are still going to be moving forward but from a perspective of its weird local SpaceTime you&#x27;re going to have this reverse time reverse wave that&#x27;s being produced and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to create your gravitational wave where it&#x27;s going to allow it to the whole thing to Ripple somewhere else this is what teleportation is it really is a form of advanced cloaking it really is actually I think that now at this point it&#x27;s a difference without a distinction um when you think of using this type of advanced cloaking what cloaking even really means is that you&#x27;re talking about producing scalar waves and when you&#x27;re doing that you&#x27;re actually producing gravitational potential and when you do that now you have this ability where you can warp your object this is why the Philadelphia Experiment why the plane why the boat warped away from the bubble inside the the object itself when it has those um electromagnetic what do they call the gaers turned on when this function is turned on the local SpaceTime is going to get time revers going to speed up they&#x27;re going to go wherever they want from their perspective it may look like they were just traveling normally but from the perspective of everything else out there it&#x27;s going to look like this object just teleported mechanics and he doesn&#x27;t understand physics and he&#x27;s put a label around his own neck and on his own forehead not me he has done it so much for Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore yes indeed I have the papers I have friends who send me the copies of letters of the names they call me so much for Los Alamos and La Li more Laboratories now so we have a Magic wave in the real world you have some change like in the ionosphere some Distortion of the exact path itself the medium because there&#x27;s is a finite time involved and so you&#x27;ll miss a little bit maybe you get 90% or 80% of it in there that&#x27;s good enough for government work that&#x27;ll destroy a missile that&#x27;ll destroy a bomber running down takes it off down a Runway before it ever takes off but this thing is Magic because now I can make a Time reversed wave I want to give you a way to visualize a Time reversed wave and settle this issue of going back to the past I want you to imagine a movie of scenes going on here and in this scene somewhere amongst all the surroundings and all and buildings and all this there is a wave generated okay and you&#x27;re watching this wave go your magic so you can watch it real slow and you&#x27;re watching it Go and suddenly we say now that wave and that wave only is reversed in time we can&#x27;t see time quantum mechanics tells us it&#x27;s not an observable you can&#x27;t detect it even in principle what we will see is the spatial aspect we will see it crawfish backwards spatially we&#x27;ll see everything else continue so what would I physically see and observe I&#x27;d see the whole rest of the world going along in positive time I would see this crazy wave suddenly stop where it&#x27;s time reversed and start to crawl fish backwards and crawl back right along its path meanwhile everything else is going on just like it was that&#x27;s all time reversal is think of it as space reversal it&#x27;s it&#x27;s the movie tenant man Dave told me this like the movie tenant he obviously knew a lot about Thomas beard and huh but it carries negative energy and that&#x27;s magic as we found out because you can get inertia and gravity from that if you get down at the right frequency optically you negative energy chat the event we&#x27; see in the video Never Get It radar you&#x27;ll never get it okay let&#x27;s continue to show you how strange a breed of cat this time reversed wave is I want to compare in normal mirror to a Time reversed mirror a phase conjugate mirror they call it look at this in the top one I show you a standard mirror over right from a point source the light from it scatters across the surface of the mirror and has the standard diverging pattern reflection as I show there that&#x27;s it&#x27;s Optical geometry everybody knows that normal reflection so if you&#x27;re doing that light scattering from the toe of your shoe across a mirror there&#x27;s one point where you get the right right angle comes to your eye so you can sh see your toe you can see your knee you can see your clothes and everything and you stand there and look in the mirror and you&#x27;re quite happy with that let&#x27;s look at a face conjugate mirror the light from the source which may be the toe of your shoe scatters across the surface of the mirror from every point on the surface of the mirror it reflects right back to the original point it crawfishes backward Boog Boog Boog right back to the point what could you see if you looked ins tou your mirror could you see your toe all that light goes back to your toe could you see your knee the only thing you could see would be the two black retinas of your eyes nothing else wow it&#x27;s a quite different breed of cat this is out of the standard literature by Pepper that&#x27;s not Tom Bearden it&#x27;s a quite different breed of cat from an ordinary EM wave and you must understand that it does not behave the same and I want to quote pepper on something else because I want to point out to you there&#x27;s a whole new physics here there&#x27;s a whole new world pepper said the real and the major discoveries in Phase conjugation and time reverse waves are yet to be made so have at it young fell there&#x27;s a 100 Nobel prizes waiting on you anti-gravity free energy violation of all the conservation laws control of it overcoming SpaceTime moving in hyper Dimensions materialization dematerialization transmutation of elements reversal of disease what what what did he just say what did he just say chat and time reverse waves are yet to be made so have at it young fell there&#x27;s a 100 Nobel prizes waiting on you anti-gravity free energy violation of all the conservation laws control of it overcoming SpaceTime moving in hyper Dimensions materialization dematerialization transmutation of elements reversal of disease reversal of Aging you name it it&#x27;s there the absolute control of physical reality you can go into the straighten your equation you can change the probabilities before they even occur and determine whether they shall emerge as physical reality or not the world is your Apple for God&#x27;s sakes get in there and work okay what it is what it is it&#x27;s a Time reverse wave it carries negative time it carries negative energy they say it has a healing property it restores the order that for Distortion crept in and then Scientific American pepper publishes a beautiful picture absolute marvelous work showing phase conjugation of the distorted image of a cat and the thing backs up into a nice beautiful picture of the cat again no problem it does distortion correction it moves from dis order back to order it has negative entropy so much for the hopelessness of the second law of thermo they always assume positive time here&#x27;s a critter moves a negative time it&#x27;s time reversed and holy [ __ ] Optical phase conjugation proves this Optical phase conjugation proves this concept the video I showed where the image uh where they distorted with the shot glass and they put it on there you&#x27;re seeing Optical phase conjugation in that you&#x27;re seeing uh negative time you&#x27;re seeing this all proven in that scenario negative entropy where the image gets restored even though it&#x27;s being distorted through the shock glass takes care of the hopelessness of the second law and recreates hope for everybody now why the hell do you age you age because most of the stuff going on is positive energy W you got all those electron shells around your atoms if you could capture the delta in the spectrographic pattern there there are spectrographic ways spectroscopic ways of doing this very detailed wave front analysis usually by digital synthesis not fora synthesis do it in impulse waves and use one more law here&#x27;s one from Bearden it ain&#x27;t in your textbook please remember this because the previous speaker had an example of it looking at you if you take Randomness like the virtual flux of vacuum and you impose upon that the structured potential the artificial potential the scaler emway very technically it produces what today we call chaos technically I&#x27;m not using chaos in the general sense I&#x27;m using chaos in the technical sense but that&#x27;s a science today but it blows ordinary science and the cha the chaos patterns that she showed using 1000 or 11 10,000 second and then adding them what you were doing is getting back at the digital synthesis of what&#x27;s really there in the signal you body&#x27;s been using that living systems has all the time that&#x27;s the way to go she&#x27;s right exactly on the track that&#x27;s exactly the way to go anyway you age because of your electron shells and your atoms but if you map the delta between the Aging cells and the younger cells and if you time reverse that Delta and if you radiate the body with that time reverse Delta you will have a signal which will move the body gradually from age back to youth let me say that again in case that went by you you capture the Aging pattern that&#x27;s like the Kash work you time reverse that pattern you have the Rejuvenation pattern and if you bathe the body and continually charge it up with that pattern it will gradually spread out through Dr Pop&#x27;s communication system and he discovered in the body the virtual state is scaler and you will rejuvenate the body some Benjamin Button stuff right here if you capture the delta in a diseased cancer cell simply subtract the scalar pattern of the normal cell from the disease pattern and you&#x27;ll have the Delta then if you reverse time reverse the Delta you will now have the specific healing pattern for that specific illness in that specific body it was done it&#x27;s been proven it was called pror mid to mid6 to mid 70s and was ruthlessly thousands of cases of terminal Cancers and leukemias in lab animals I&#x27;m not joking about that rigorous opes with some f French scientists including Robert cier head of the biology section and the Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy the story of all of that is in my new book called AE biological warfare as is all the physics there&#x27;s a chapter called extraordinary physics covers all this mess and there&#x27;s a chapter called extraordinary biology covers all the biology please read that part of it because it lays a foundation for the electromagnetic healing of disease that&#x27;s the purpose of the book The subtitle used to be in electr gravitation because almost half the book is on electr gravity okay you can do some other marvelous things now here&#x27;s the magic one if you make time reversed waves their characteristic was they do not diverge they converge they retain a laser like being well if you can make with standard practices a hologram at 3 ft in a laboratory by the way this does it in real time you don&#x27;t even have to make a hologram first with a couple of beams this is in the literature this is not Tom Bearden they say very gently it&#x27;s distant independ distant independent distance independent sometimes we can talk we learned that last week uh I think faster possible but if it&#x27;s distance independent and you can do it at three feet in the laboratory I can do it at 15,000 mil in the field with a radar and it&#x27;s so hard to build a scaler radar that it just takes a plumbing section in the wave guide and a switch to throw and you get a scaler Beam not a normal beam and if you interfere that two scalar beams and you&#x27;re responding you create a Time reverse wave in each beam from two Radars in response to some signal either passively received or reflected like from the over the rising radar from a distance Target you can put a 6 in or 3in ball of light inside that Target at 15,000 mi in the latter part of November a shuttle launch at night was the third shuttle they tested these weapons against there is the strike of such an electromagnetic missile which I published the picture Bob Gladwin took it in 30 lamps there is a ball of light hanging up which they use to switch from and shoot from a standard artillery technique shift from a registered Point hanging up seen by hundreds of people photographed by George sukri I printed out photograph and it&#x27;s all in the book they offset it so they wouldn&#x27;t kill the shuttle now I&#x27;m going to tell you something else two weeks later we didn&#x27;t react didn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on by the way 12 minutes after that shuttle got down range there was humongous explosion over the site heard 600 miles up and down the coast made to local papers didn&#x27;t make the national news they don&#x27;t know what the hell&#x27;s going on hundreds of Engineers with a whole Sky blowing up over their damn heads heard for 600 miles said what is that and the standard thing was we don&#x27;t even recognize this stuff when it&#x27;s used over our own head now two weeks later I&#x27;m going to tell you another little story because I got a new piece of data for you the same over the rising radar called a woodpecker using time reversed wave real time distance independent holography all those terms come out of the literature not Tom beardon only they did it with Radars first and they&#x27;re doing it today an RC8 started down the runway at Gander Air Force Base Nu jet engines on big high reflectivity nice signal to an over the rising radar you&#x27;ve got your micro microwatt Tesla said I have an invisible wire started the interferometer interfered with the combustion of the engines as she&#x27;s taken off they then struck that airplane with an electromagnet missile just like I told you about now let us reason together if they did do that the missile penetrated the airplane on one side went right straight through out the other side and it set fire to all of the inside at that point all the Plastics were violently and explosively set a flame that would have had to happen there is a hole in the right fuselage ahead of the engine we ignited the batteries we ignited the batteries using scalar interferometry we I didn&#x27;t just didn&#x27;t think about this till just now this is what we did to the batteries we started the fire on the batteries he just explained it you shoot the beams at the plane you ignite the batteries that are in the cargo hold intentionally stacked up together next to the the electronics Bay boom batteries ignite start on fire was not chemical explosion because they check set a flame the missile penetrated the airplane on one side went right straight through out the other side and it set fire to all of the inside at that point all the Plastics were violently and explosively set a fire that would ever had to happen there is a hole in the right fuselage ahead of the engines was not chemical explosion because they checked it for that no chemical residues and there&#x27;s another hole in it where&#x27; come out yeah but you had to ignite the Plastics if you had ignited the Plastics you would have had a violent out flux of orange flame the windows would have been glowing orange out and that was seen the three eyewitnesses the interference would have been interfering with the combustion and one eyewitness that had passed directly over his head said the engines were laboring they did not develop full power everybody knows it was Ice it&#x27;s been validated that they checked the ice on top of the wind got back in the airplane for left that&#x27;s false and here&#x27;s a clincher if the Plastics were on fire the Plastics out gas one of the products from those kinds of plastics is hydrogen cyanide and the people in that part of the plane would have had to breathe hydrogen cyanide and die before the airplane sunk to the ground and crashed now here&#x27;s what the US government and a Canadian government have withheld from you and they withheld from the board doing the investigation which is a legal offense and criminal and they ought to be hauled into court and who&#x27;s responsible for it ought to be put in the penitentiary for conspiracy in a murder case now they did autopsy chat he just said that by zapping the plane like this zapping airplane like this it&#x27;s going to release hydrogen cyanide killing everybody on board the plane except for potentially people had their masks on I think everybody died so why would they teleport the plane they killed everybody they killed everybody on the plane they can&#x27;t say anything about it because it would give away scaler interferometry fire the Plastics out gas one of the products from those kinds of plastic they did not develop full power everybody knows it was Ice it&#x27;s been validated that they checked the ice on top of the wi got back in the airplane pull the left that&#x27;s false and here&#x27;s a clincher if the Plastics were on fire the Plastics out gas one of the products from those kinds of plastics is hydrogen cyanide and the people in that part of the plane would have had to breathe hydrogen cyanide and die before the airplane sunk to the ground and crashed wow now here&#x27;s what the US government and the Canadian government have withheld from you and they withheld from the board doing the investigation which is a legal offense and criminal and they ought to be hauled into court and who&#x27;s responsible for it ought to be put in the penitentiary for conspiracy in a murder case now they did autopsies on all of the remains but about two there wasn&#x27;t enough left to do there and about one half of those people were dead of hydrogen CI before they hit the ground so we&#x27;ve got the picture of the strike of an electromagnetic missile 2 weeks earlier we got the picture of the distant holography two weeks earlier we got the whole where to hit the airplane we got the orange glow from the fire we got the fire we got the hydrogen cyanide we got half the dead people the Soviet Union killed a d airplane holy [ __ ] chat we killed everybody on the plane they didn&#x27;t teleport the plane to save the people they teleported the plane away to so there&#x27; be no evidence so that nobody would be able to tell what happened to it maybe they saved some of the people the letter to me is real the letter to me is either somebody who knew about Thomas Bearden somehow and all of this and is presenting some kind of lar based on Tom bearden&#x27;s physics or this is real this is so freaking crazy there&#x27;s only that&#x27;s the only two ways about it the letter to asht and forb said everybody on board was dead the nephew the pilot the nephew of the pilot was told that his everybody on board was collateral damage we don&#x27;t know where the families when they all moved on they were told that they were killed they were killed by us we shot the infometer beam at the plane ignited the batteries caused hydrogen cyanide to spill through at least part of the plane killing most if not everybody and those people were already dead then we warped the plane away cuz nobody&#x27;s going to we need nobody to ever find it and the only way that we have any idea about this ever happening would have been the Perfect Crime but somebody leaked two videos on the internet that&#x27;s the only way we know about it holy [ __ ] just I can&#x27;t believe we just had another Epiphany right now this is this is the craziest story ever we&#x27;re going to talk a little bit about this after I&#x27;m actually kind of shook right now chat I&#x27;m kind of shook right now a A can figure this out I&#x27;m actually afraid for the people investigating with a they&#x27;re either going to get silenced or they&#x27;re going to get silen silenced um I might have like literally put people in danger over this this is a massive conspiracy and cover up and if this technolog is real you you heard what we can do with this technology I mean we&#x27;re talking about teleporting objects we&#x27;re talking about being able to shoot blasts of energy over long distances you can see what it did he just explained exactly how it can kill everybody on the plane it&#x27;s a 99.9% certain conclusion let&#x27;s continue that&#x27;s the characteristics and let&#x27;s talk about Tesla&#x27;s magnifying transmitter I want to show you quickly how it works but I want you to know this you know about Nicola Tesla everybody here knows about Tesla we don&#x27;t have to talk about Tesla to this audience i e yes here no you know what he did you know what he was buing on Long Island the famous magnifying transmitter take the Earth treat it momentarily as an isotropic nonlinear medium hey nonlinear baby remember that word it&#x27;s going to come back to hus he was going to be putting in a signal into the Earth he had a tremendous ground plane down there if you pump up and down like this you pump this way into the Earth as well as pumping up into the elevated capacitance I mean every fool knows that right so yeah you got a signal going in the earth what happens to that well you believe Newton&#x27;s third law right by the way we can derive that from this and I found out Fineman thought of it first and I was delighted I had one piece missing of what happened in the nucleus until my utter complete Delight hen Mon&#x27;s already work that out beautifully and showed me last night much to my great appreciation so he filled in the missing piece that I couldn&#x27;t find out how to fill in Henry already had it okay so we have a wave occurring in the earth you heard of vacum F and all those good things that all gets generated and it gets generated out of phase it&#x27;s a Time reversed wave that&#x27;s what&#x27;s caus this Newton Third Law I tell you we can dve that I don&#x27;t have time to do it and what happens is we have then a scal WAV it&#x27;s nonlinear medium the back EMF the forward EMF locked together is a zero Vector system and that&#x27;s electr gravitational you got a scal EM wave now spherical wave goes into the Earth you now got the pump wave that&#x27;s the if you put in the back EMF locked together as a single system you got a pump phase conjugate spherical mirror Earth do you see that at Whatever frequency he was going to be using and he was using frequencies at which the Earth is resonant so you will get a standing scalar spherical way through the nuclei of the Earth this goes through the nuclei don&#x27;t bother with them electron shells like that well the Earth is already highly stressed what&#x27;s stress what&#x27;s mechanical heat stress every kind of wave you&#x27;re going even the mechanical stress Quantum mechanically a little electromagnetic virtual particles going it&#x27;s electromagnetic at bases the electromagnetic stress feeds this wave remember I talked about stressing the nonlinear nucleus this is a different kind of nonlinearity the heat stress and the mechanical stress the electromagnetics we got exactly the same situation chat we can absolutely cause earthquakes with this earthquakes earthquakes is actually a trivial application of this I don&#x27;t mean to to put things down but causing earthquake related to this is is Trivial if we can warp a plane from one location to another using pumped phase conjugation um this is scary I might never get another plane ever again boiling like M it&#x27;s a cathode and it&#x27;s a trout and we putting in the grid signal and that whole sucker now all the power gets in the earth lots more power is in there from the amplification furnished by the Earth it&#x27;s a pump phase conjugate mirror as a matter of fact shelf pump it starts to resonate itself and build up builds up to a nice value lots of power in it so what&#x27;s going to happen now that it&#x27;s a pumped phase conjugate mirror with scalar resonance which is what we finally get to what&#x27;s going to happen when I self pumping the heat and stuff is what furnishes the self pump wave we don&#x27;t have to furnish anything but The Little Wave to get it initiated when I put in a little input signal to another input somewhere else around the world here Bingo I get back the Amplified phase conjugate replica big Amplified power there&#x27;s a thousand papers in the literature prove pumping and self- pumping systems they prove the amplification they prove the nonlinearity so so if you believe those mechanisms then it ought to be possible to do that and you can do that anywhere and you can power the whole earth from the internal heat and pressure that you&#x27;re tapping and what was so beautiful about what mon teeth had he explained that all the disorder went to the electron shells and all the order comes out on the time reverse wave and it&#x27;s beautiful it&#x27;s perfect what he&#x27;s worked out now what comes out is a nice coherent wave almost like a laser at all these points you could power the whole earth with this system except there&#x27;s a little fla with it the Earth is not quite an isotropic medium the Soviets have already proved and the westing house has proved that if you use the beat frequency between two waves the Earth will think you transmitted a s wave at that beat frequency and they&#x27;ll go through as a sign wave and do what I&#x27;ve said and the Soviets proved if you use circular polarization you will have standing wave Solutions it&#x27;s all there in bits and pieces in the literature so if I take the linear Optics work the pump phase conjugate mirror work the way Tesla active built the thing I take the beat frequency knowledge and I take the ccop polarization knowledge you can do what I had on the diagrams and the thing will work and you can power the whole from one transmitter there Eric I don&#x27;t know if Eric&#x27;s in the chat he just he just explained how where the extra energy is in Antarctica that they can&#x27;t find so I remember the clip of Eric Hecker saying that there&#x27;s either another nuclear reaction another nuclear reactor on on in Antarctica which there&#x27;s not there&#x27;s a treaty against it or there&#x27;s another exotic power source they can just pump the energy straight out of the earth infinite energy as much as they need that&#x27;s what he just described right there uh enough to be able to uh control 500 5,160 DS at 2,000 volts each easily and probably just have a capacitor that can charge it [Music] up Star Trek chat and that&#x27;s the secret of Tesla&#x27;s magnifying transmitter that cat had discovered what today we call phase conjugation and pumped for wve mixing it was workable my conclusion is Tesla knew about it only he didn&#x27;t use those terms he had discovered phase conjugation and time reversed wave and Frank golden showed in 1985 27 such channels exactly like that put into the Earth by the Soviet Union and I looked at it on the oscilloscope they were 12 khz apart they were taking power out of the earth enormous power 12 khz and Power in that whole big system for gbop in and around Mayday 1985 gbop had been in power just a short time that was the stated time they were going to be ready to have all this ready they stated 1972 they made the schedule they were using Tesla&#x27;s magnifying transmitter the Earth Sun and Moon are formed in a Triad linked by such scaler wave resonance and you better watch what you do on the earth with this Mass massive stuff or you will tickle the Sun and if the sun burps and spits out a mighty hiccup of fiery molten material you may really have the Book of Revelations and the Holocaust coming at you don&#x27;t laugh what we looked at in and around May the 1st 1985 if Miss triggered could have done precisely that every time the Soviet Union energizes these big continent Busters they risk the total survival of the human race now we&#x27;re going to add one law one rule we&#x27;re going to take CPT and we&#x27;re going to add all the other stuff in I will give you a new rule it&#x27;s called CP EGS charge parity time energy gravity entropy but now we got a rule how to use all of it put together the rule is here&#x27;s the normal normally we interact with electron shells that&#x27;s negative charge par is normal space parity time is plus time time flow energy normal positive energy gravity is the normal kind which means attraction of mass and entropy is a tendency to more and more disorder that&#x27;s normal physics normal reality but when you use time reversal if you reverse the rule is this if you reverse one of those things you reverse all of them all the rest wow now you can do in gravity you can do entropy and you can do negative energy if you short out a massive amount of negative energy in the laboratory you get a brilliant flash that&#x27;ll blind you for a couple of days and the thing will freeze ice around it it doesn&#x27;t heat cool okay prority lab I want to tell you he just explained the flash in the MH370 videos I I he I didn&#x27;t really catch it but he just explained it chat this is wild I can&#x27;t believe this video is so good now you can do andg gravity you can do entropy and you can do negative energy if you short out a massive amount of negative energy in the laboratory you get a brilliant flash that&#x27;ll blind you for a couple of days and the thing will freeze ice around it it doesn&#x27;t heat cools okay priority lab I want to tell you about healing cancer it&#x27;s a massive flash of negative energy causing the cooling effect that we see that&#x27;s the Flash and the cold it&#x27;s both of them negative energy he just said it right there 125 uh I guys this this might be one of the most important lectures that have ever been posted on the internet yeah I can&#x27;t even joke about it I&#x27;m like it&#x27;s just too already did this is his little setup he K healed all the rats and the lab animals with Up Above This Big call here there is a rotating plasma fed by 17 frequencies up in the gigahertz band yeah he knew he knew for sure plasma a one thing that do face conjugation we know today they didn&#x27;t know it in the West in 1965 Pur and so he has a Rippling magnetic field strong magnetic field which by magnetic resonance will get him into the nucleus of all the atoms by nuclear magnetic resonance why in the nucleus because he&#x27;s got to get down where the negative energy stuff and the negative Time stuff is in gravity is that&#x27;s where the control system of the immune system and the living systems are living systems have had to use Nega entropy to keep producing the same kind of species pattern otherwise the law of entropy would eat them alive after about three generations you couldn&#x27;t transmit the pattern anymore there wouldn&#x27;t even be species you have to use negative entropy and that&#x27;s why living systems use negative energy negative time and scaler waves he produces the in a phase conjugate pattern he&#x27;s learned what the right mixture is to give him the anti- pattern for that cancer he comes right back down through gets down into the bone cells everything else bathes every cell in a little animal and reverses to cancer if you D differentiate a cancer cell turns back to a normal cell now Robert Becker should have the Nobel Prize for proving how little weak Pico ERS of current heel bone it takes the red blood cell Shooks off the hemoglobin the thing regrows the genetic nucleus with all the genetics turns into that kind of cell that&#x27;s called dedifferentiation going back to a more primitive cell that any what&#x27;s needed so it it then crawls around and turns into the kind of cell makes cartilage that ain&#x27;t what&#x27;s needed so then it crawls around and changes into the kind of cell that makes bone and heals these horrible bone fractures and he proved that in vitrio with frogs actually to heal bone terrible bone fractures should have a Nobel Prize nobody had the foggiest notion that was the blood red blood cells responding to Pico amps of current tiny current so small you can&#x27;t hardly measure can you not do Pico ampers with this thing in the body of course you can can you not drive Sals through that whole structure of course you can you can do electromagnetic healing of any kind of cellular disease known to man you don&#x27;t have to understand the cause you just got to capture the Delta and time reverse it and do that to the body and you&#x27;ll cure it and that&#x27;s why they wiped out priori and that&#x27;s why they suppressed that machine because a dead cancer patient is 167,000 bucks multiply that by 500,000 a year in the United States and you&#x27;ll see why they don&#x27;t want to cure cancer so how they going to cure AIDS they&#x27;re going to give it to the same Bunch that&#x27;s refused to cure cancer for all these years how many AIDS patients are going to die before they do this this is proven it worked it&#x27;s real it&#x27;s still in the French hardcore medical literature there&#x27;s no reason for these 500,000 people dying every year and for the age people dying $100 million and three years will cure all of those diseases they&#x27;re not going to spend it that way they&#x27;re going to give it to that crew you can&#x27;t make a vaccine and they&#x27;re going to spend billions and bankrupt the old medical system and they&#x27;re not going to cure it that&#x27;s the way to cure it that&#x27;s my new book thank you for your attention [Applause] Encore Encore I&#x27;d be giv a standing ovation I&#x27;d be doing a standing ovation right now Encore holy crap H how did I never get to meet Thomas Bearden still drink of water I would literally kill somebody to meet Thomas beard Andrea puar once accused me of sounding like a Baptist preacher and I&#x27;m afraid I did tonight I want every video ever about Thomas thank you very much for your attention this is this is by far the biggest Revelation uh in the entire case that we&#x27;ve ever had if if the videos were not not real then there would be no Thomas Bearden out there there wouldn&#x27;t be some guy who&#x27;s a lieutenant colonel electrical engineer who&#x27;s literally been describing every single aspect of the videos down to the tiniest detail um including the flash we I can understand the battery fire now as well which I never thought I&#x27;d be able to explain um somebody asked first of all somebody made a great point which is that people this is not a liar if you think that&#x27;s a liar when you&#x27;re watching that then you really are not a good judge of people whatsoever there&#x27;s you might say he&#x27;s wrong but I don&#x27;t don&#x27;t see anyone saying that either or able to prove that but that is impossible to lie to that level of detail I mean he&#x27;s given you all of the details that are all verifiable evidence information um why he was not on alived he died two years ago um but nobody would have they they weren&#x27;t afraid of him because there had been videos out there the MH370 videos that prove Thomas beard incorrect have been out there and nobody took him seriously we needed those videos to have video proof of what he was saying because the science is locked up in special access programs in the United States this explains also our hard TRS podcast guests Dave constantly talking about you have to look at the papers in Russia look at the papers in China because it&#x27;s all suppressed in the United States this is even where other people that have talked to have said um people that I&#x27;ve talked to on my podcasts uh said the inertial mass reduction that&#x27;s the part that they&#x27;re hiding that&#x27;s the part that Congress is hiding that&#x27;s out there um now Eric Decker was in the OR Hecker was in the chat as well and he said he had talked to AO a is going to be able to confirm the videos are real they&#x27;re going to be able to confirm them there&#x27;s no doubt about it uh so we need to get ahead of that right now um what would be the next play if you&#x27;re the CIA and you are trying to cover this up you killed a whole Plane full of people you warped it away why did they warp it away so let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s just run this down so the plane gets ignited by the scaler in aerometer potentially from Radars that are super far away they they hit the plane in fact Russia or China could hit the plane and set it on fire as well that&#x27;s also now back into the mix I think it&#x27;s unlikely based on China&#x27;s response says China&#x27;s response says that they most likely did not start it unless there&#x27;s some weird angle I&#x27;m not seeing there we start the fire plane freaks out turns around we warp the plane away because we killed everybody we can&#x27;t leave any evidence of it um there&#x27;s no evidence of a missile although I would still just let it crash as is the thing I just let it crash you know um but we were filming it with the drones so we saw it so we to we&#x27;re the ones implicated for sure we use uh four-way or potentially even five-way pumped phase conjugation to warp the plane to a different location um now if you&#x27;re the intelligence Community the play now is you&#x27;re caught you&#x27;re 100% caught we we&#x27;ve got them dead to wrs not only do we have more evidence of any court case ever we&#x27; proved all the debunks are objectively false uh those debunks most likely came from intelligence agencies uh they&#x27;re the only ones who I mean you&#x27;d have to be absolutely desperate to try to cover these up if they are they&#x27;re kind of stupid because they forgot that you can&#x27;t have a 2d picture in a 3D uh fully 3D rendered environment which is what you need for two angles so they screwed up their debunk wasn&#x27;t even that good they may have been s had that uh Cloud picture out there since 2016 when the videos first showed up so that they could try to debunk them or something like that now the next play to me because if the arrow person the person I&#x27;m talking to at Arrow most likely has no idea this is real either and they&#x27;re going to fall down the rabbit hole because they&#x27;re going to realize the information I&#x27;m giving them is verifiably accurate and that Edward C Linn went to prison over those videos he&#x27;s going to be able to figure it out and the next play that is you have to silence that person you have to you know what I would do if I was the intelligence commune what I would do is I would use AI to make to do what uh kim.com said make the video without the orbs and without the zapping it I would use AI to make another video and then what I would claim is yeah yeah yeah we were tracking it we were tracking it but the orbs and the zap are fake that&#x27;s what I would do and release a video of that you admit to the fact that you were tracking it in the location where turned into the South Indian Ocean which is what we have them on record showing I would make a video without the orbs without the zap in it and I would say somebody faked this maybe a government person did maybe China did it for disinformation and then show the the real video which is the one that they would fabricate and maybe you don&#x27;t even need two maybe you just need just the satellite one because then it&#x27;s it&#x27;s too complicated the more videos you fake the more things people are going to find discrepancies in so you make just a satellite video with the the orbs without the zap in it using AI you push that out you release that to me through a you say a found this video and turns out yeah we we were tracking it but we didn&#x27;t phase it away that&#x27;s silly haaa that&#x27;s how you potentially try to make it go away from this point because they&#x27;re they&#x27;re caught they&#x27;re just caught red-handed we we know how the science works the science is something that I would never have even known was out there and everyone would have dismissed that science probably for for another 10 years without these videos uh so if they do that now we know cuz that&#x27;s the play that&#x27;s the only play otherwise you&#x27;re just dead to rights there&#x27;s no denying this and we&#x27;ve got the engineer who works with who worked uh on special access programs Thomas Bearden we&#x27;ve got Dave Rossi who is on records saying he thinks it&#x27;s real and explaining it the same exact way he&#x27;s even the one that came up with the four orbs thing how do you guys think Dave Rossy came up with the four orbs scal inom and we have the letter to Ashton Forbes which explains all of this the letter to me is explaining all of this down to the fact that the passengers were killed I I just I don&#x27;t know this is crazy this is actually crazy hm yeah this makes me kind of hate Humanity as well and in fact like this I&#x27;m going to be real with you guys chat all day today uh I&#x27;ve been struggling with this now because the implications of this it&#x27;s one thing to talk about it and to be like sure in your own mind that this stuff played out I mean the amount of Investigation I think some people in the chat have been here so long that you&#x27;re like up there with me in terms of you know how much evidence there is it&#x27;s an incredible amount you&#x27;ve watched a lot of my interviews I&#x27;ve done over 70 podcasts and interviews and gone through all the evidence and the way of the evidence is so massive but it&#x27;s another thing where you you can now explain exactly how and you start to understand the implications of this like he just listed them all off we can hyperspace things dematerialize rematerialize you can cure Cancers and diseases um and then you have free energy free energy is that&#x27;s the ultimate one where free energy changes everything and if you can have free energy and unlimited energy it&#x27;s it&#x27;s not even just about the socioeconomic impact it&#x27;s about the fact that we are going to destroy ourselves with this technology like that is the ultimate conclusion we will destroy ourselves with this this is why people that produce overunity devices don&#x27;t talk about it you know why because they understand the seriousness of the situation they understand that if Isis gets this technology or whatever the next Isis is instead of cutting people&#x27;s heads off on television on on social media they&#x27;re going to blow up the whole planet they&#x27;re going to cause an earthquake and I don&#x27;t know pick your favorite City this is uh this is huge we&#x27;re talking Star Trek stuff here and the question is are we even ready for it like I actually at this point like I&#x27;m I&#x27;m I&#x27;m effed like I&#x27;m not suicidal I want to make sure everybody knows that even if I&#x27;m like depressed about the situation with this I&#x27;m not suicidal but everybody&#x27;s going to want to kill me pretty much I mean let&#x27;s just be honest intelligence community that did this I&#x27;m probably the bane of their existence right now people are afraid of going to prison over this if it&#x27;s them or me they&#x27;re going to make sure that it&#x27;s them making it um not just our intelligence Community but now imagine foreign intelligences foreign intellig this guy this random guy Ashton Forbes on a Twitter account started figuring out what the super weapons and Hypersonic weapons are not only am I a threat to our intelligence Community I&#x27;m a threat to the other intelligence communities what if if you&#x27;re Russia or you&#x27;re China and this guy named Ashton Forbes is out there and he&#x27;s explaining how all the super weapons work well he can figure that out for you he can figure out your stuff as well if the intelligence communities pick me up and help me work with them I&#x27;m a threat to all the other countries that are out there as well I might never get on a plane ever again I don&#x27;t know that would protect me but it&#x27;s just wow man yeah and scalar waves are dangerous free energy devices that bend gravity from the clip that we looked at yesterday that can bend gravity um it&#x27;s dangerous to be around that it&#x27;s going to mess with your body I honestly hope the intelligence communities are stupider than I&#x27;m giving them credit for CU if it was me I&#x27;d be very afraid of myself just just throwing that out there um I&#x27;m going to show the email uh there&#x27;s not much more in the email that I didn&#x27;t already show but at this point uh I&#x27;m just sitting here thinking like uh you know I don&#x27;t know how this is going to play out if if AR is going to Gaslight me or whatever I I don&#x27;t know um I don&#x27;t think they are they respond guys that I got from a shook me today what I expected a to say to me is no we checked and there&#x27;s nothing we didn&#x27;t find anything um yeah I hope I&#x27;m wrong and I hope that I&#x27;m not effed and that and that they don&#x27;t care um is this enough information I&#x27;m trying to make sure I&#x27;m not doxing anybody uh cuz I told this person I wouldn&#x27;t dox them I do have to confirm this person&#x27;s real although I just from the interactions I have my email and the Aro person it&#x27;d be pretty damn weird if they were committing a felony and and impersonating a Federal Officer but I will find out um just double check him before I show this so I expected AO to come back and say yeah no just Gaslight me you know like they would just Gaslight me and that&#x27;s how I know that the person I talk to is not compromised yet uh but that they are going to fall down the rabbit hole from this because they probably don&#x27;t realize this stuff&#x27;s real either [Music] um okay so here&#x27;s the email uh that I got you can see I got this morning m Mr Forbes my apologies for the slow responses AO is researching several topics at the moment some of A&#x27;s initial Research into MH370 has revealed the US government&#x27;s search efforts after The Airliner disappeared from radar uh guys read between the lines read between the lines here I believe the Genesis and authenticity of the videos may be helpful I believe the Genesis and the authenticity of the videos may be helpful can you confirm the date that the videos were posted on the reg side and on YouTube channel and yes a quick follow-up call may be helpful now I didn&#x27;t dox anybody here uh normally I wouldn&#x27;t post communication like this but this communication is probably the biggest break in all of MH370 since the plane disappeared this is an admission that the United States government was potentially tracking the plane nobody has known that that has not been something that&#x27;s ever come out in the media this should basically be front page news regarding the the air plane going missing this is the most evidence that anybody has ever pulled from the United States government about what they know about the plane ever they even want to know about the authenticity of the videos to me this says we looked we looked at we looked at what cers video looks like and it looks just like that to me that&#x27;s what this says when you read between the lines this says yeah we looked up initially to see like does the cers video look like that or does the Drone video look like that yep it does so we need to talk to you again cuz we need to know more about how those videos got out there if you&#x27;re a debunker you&#x27;re on suicide watch right now because now the question is for the debunkers watch the debunkers flip the script and now say the a can&#x27;t be trusted remember how much the debunkers were jerking off a when they came out and said there was nothing anomalous remember how much they were jerking them off if Aro comes out and verifies the videos the MH370 videos you&#x27;re going to see people&#x27;s heads [ __ ] explode it&#x27;s going to be like that Meme of the dude&#x27;s heads exploding with the debunkers cuz they&#x27;re going to flip the switch and now immediately claim that AO has been compromised that they&#x27;re F blah blah blah these videos the MH370 videos are full disclosure this is full disclosure it doesn&#x27;t tell us whether or not there&#x27;s aliens here but it tells us we 100% have anti-gravitational technology and scaler physics type technology plus it means that the intelligence Community planted the SAT the picture the satellite picture if these videos get confirmed think of the implications for people like Jonas D Jonas D potentially could face criminal charge for pushing a fabricated satellite picture not just criminal charges but he would get every last penny he ever has would get sued from the the families every last penny Mick West his whole life would be over Mick West is all in on debunking these videos if these videos get confirmed by Aro Mick West&#x27;s life is over you guys realize the implications of this this is why I say if you are one of these Nut Job Reddit debunkers who are out there you better [ __ ] think twice man you better start thinking twice you better take a real good look at this email that I just got and you better think twice about what you say publicly on on a public forum I am if these videos get confirmed I am absolutely sending the families after the people that tried to debunk them to take everything that you have especially the people that said the family should sue me I&#x27;m sing the family&#x27;s after you anyone who tries to debunk these videos make make 100% sure you are 100% sure about that cuz if you&#x27;re wrong they&#x27;re coming after you just a heads up make sure you take a good look at this email you guys better pray to God that this email is some kind of elaborate hoax where somebody is impersonating the Pentagon and a military officer so yeah and Eric in the chat says I started figuring things out in the early 2000s yeah Eric I definitely need to talk to you man I think we need to have a private conversation first and then maybe we do a a podcast we can even do a double stream podcast I don&#x27;t really care to me at this point this isn&#x27;t about me making money or anything I just want to talk to other people that understand the physics and the implications and have a conversation where people can realize that our authenticity in terms of uncovering this type of stuff um because Aro can be a a resourceful tool but this is a propaganda War as you guys can see I mean the information&#x27;s been out there and it&#x27;s been out there for a long time and people need to see it from people who are authentic uh and not from people that are out there like grifting in the UFO community and stuff like that so yeah the scary part is even if this um even if AO were to come back and say the videos are real the debunkers will like come up with some weird explanation for why they&#x27;re still not real like they&#x27;re never going to admit they&#x27;re wrong there&#x27;s no standard by which the debunkers would ever admit they&#x27;re wrong which is ironic because you have a lot of people who come to me and say oh well what will you do when they find the plane you know that&#x27;s the favorite thing that everybody likes to say how about what will you do when the AO says the videos are real that that&#x27;s really what C&#x27;s video looks like and that&#x27;s really what mq1 cra drone looks like and that the United States was really tracking the plane what would you do in that hypothetical scenario debunkers are you going to admit you wrong and just for the record and this is a a little bit presumptuous here because of course we still have a long way to go with this I don&#x27;t want any apologies from anybody I don&#x27;t want any apologies from anyone if we get disclosure from this I don&#x27;t want Jeremy Corbell apologizing I don&#x27;t want the debunkers apologizing I just want them to rethink their life&#x27;s decisions and everything they know about the world to be true or not and I want them to be better people in general that&#x27;s all I don&#x27;t want them to apologize to me I&#x27;m not not interested in apologies or whatever I just want people to like not be [ __ ] losers all the time so okay guys I&#x27;m going to go to sleep this was a pretty crazy space pretty crazy stream I mean um I didn&#x27;t plan on going through the a stuff at the end end but after watching that and seeing all the explicit details especially around the four-way interferometry also another note guys in the chat can you um look up free scale semiconductors why did they call it free scale what&#x27;s the history behind the name free scale semiconductors does that actually stand for like free energy scaler physics what does that actually stand for why did they come up with free scale I&#x27;m that&#x27;s very weird to me so if you guys can figure that out if anyone out there can figure out why it was called free scale there might be another connection there um just looking through my Clips here um The Philadelphia Experiment could very well be real I think I just hard for me to imagine it&#x27;s not we have Thomas Bearden saying that he knows it&#x27;s real on the record there um there&#x27;s still quite a few science terms that I need to check out I&#x27;m probably am going to post something about pumped phase conjugation if you guys find any good resources for any of the stuff that we just mentioned here let me know I think there&#x27;s a CIA document about negative entropy and negative energy we may want to take another hard look at that as well okay guys this is crazy uh this is crazy man anyway I hope you guys have a good night um let&#x27;s think about tonight let&#x27;s just be thankful let&#x27;s be thankful for every thing we have in this world and let&#x27;s just think deeply about the considerations and implications of this type of Technology being real uh I think it&#x27;s so massive again it&#x27;s one thing to know the videos and stuff are real it&#x27;s another thing to know that the science is real and understand the science and to be able to understand what the implications of the science are it&#x27;s so massive that you can begin to understand why there&#x27;s this huge uh erted effort to suppress the the stuff in the UFO Community suppress the science what have you is that it all it all goes back to free energy so have a great night everybody we&#x27;ll do more tomorrow uh thanks everybody thanks m370x love you guys peace everyone</p>
