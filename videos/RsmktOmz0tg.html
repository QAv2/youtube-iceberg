            <p>l he [Music] mines are 5,000 years on this planet and they knew a lot more than us today what did the ancient people knew what we don&#x27;t know now a lot for example let us play with some magnets here it is old fashion magnet North Pole South Pole let&#x27;s bring in some long magnets too point the opposite poles contraction H some Force let&#x27;s rotate the long magnets now let&#x27;s see if we can shape the magnet a little bit different now bring back the long magnets wow did you see that again we can conclude Magnus produce force force means motion and motion means [Laughter] [Music] rotation the Mayan engine [Music] [Music] [Music] but due to the air and mechanical resistance it won&#x27;t leap you to another dimension [Music] [Music] he [Music] well is there a way to reach the speed of light Einstein said if you are very close to the speed of light time and space will [Music] bend James Clark Maxwell founder of the Maxwell equations we need is to understand the graphito magnetism we are trying to reach graphito magnetism can fighter us huny graphity and the time space [Music] banding here we have a donut coil and a donut chamber okay let&#x27;s wire it now that won&#x27;t work of course luckily there was this great scientist he knew how to transport electricity without bias 116 years ago okay he also discovered a way to provide everybody on this planet of free Power without harming the environment at all H that&#x27;s strange it&#x27;s not fair to place good love in great scientist in such a dark light [Music] so we have the power on place but it still won&#x27;t work we need a super fluid a fluid with no resistance at all if we can get our hands on such a fluid we need a very good container to hold it because if there is a hole of just the size of one atom of the fluid then the fluid runs through instantly we are getting closer [Music] now fill it up now but we forgot a very important thing yes the Ring The Ring is a fluid too ferof fluid who makes the ring due the magnetic force [Music] now the setup is complete and we can start the engine [Music] if you&#x27;re interested in more information on this topic please view the film anti-gravity physics explained on the YouTube channel much more information awesome work a Great Hero puts that on the net thank you very much for watching he [Music]</p>
