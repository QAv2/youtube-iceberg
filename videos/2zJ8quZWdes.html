            <p>boomerang shape, jellyfish shaped, uh, you know, tic tac shaped. You You&#x27;re not just making these words up like you saw visual evidence of these. Just explain to me seeing something like that. Well, number one, it&#x27;s pretty striking cuz you&#x27;re watching it from satellite beads and that&#x27;s just something the general public doesn&#x27;t get to see. Um, and then two, just the size of it.</p>
<p>It was immediately like, wo, what the hell is that? It was in, I assume, infrared, and yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost playful in its activities or like it was startled. But it&#x27;s one of those cases where I look at it and it looks like a flying saucer. What do you mean it looks star? What does that mean? You know, it&#x27;s just looking at an area over the ocean is what it appears. And this thing just comes trundling along from uh like underneath the cloud cover comes up and then right when it&#x27;s like almost center frame, it scoots off to the side and like tries to get out of like it comes into us and going, &quot;Oops, I&#x27;m being somebody spotted me. I can get out.&quot; Exactly.</p>
