            <p>if you and your friend only Moves In One Direction call the X Direction and the distance between is 16 M then this Vector is 1dimensional with the magnitude of 16 m in X Direction but now and another dimension is opened and your friend is free to move in one more Dimension we call this new direction as the y direction this time the distance between you and your friend is the combination of how much he moves in X Direction and the y direction and the vector it forms we call it the two dimensional Vector which is the combination of 16 M magnitude in both X and Y Direction but somehow your friend gets Wings through which it can fly in straight up direction we call it the Z Direction which makes our new Vector as a three-dimensional Vector which is the combination of magnitude 16 16 and 5 m in X Y and Z Direction and that&#x27;s how we Define vectors</p>
