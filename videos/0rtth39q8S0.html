            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>If you go to this location in Red Dead Redemption 2, when you arrive here, by chance, a man will ask you to help look for his friend Tucker, who disappeared during a storm. &gt;&gt; Tucker can be found west southwest of the lodge near a spiky fallen tree, mauled to death, and half frozen to a rock. &gt;&gt; His friend can either be misled or informed about his fate. If you mislead, he will get on his horse and leave down the mountain, and if told the truth, will rush up to where Tucker&#x27;s body is. Upon arriving, he briefly mourns his friend before a grizzly bear that presumably killed Tucker appears and attacks him.</p>
