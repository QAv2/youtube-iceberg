            <p>now i feel like i have to prepare you before i show you this cold fusion device it really isn&#x27;t much to look at in fact uh when i got there i walked right by it because it&#x27;s in a tupperware container like something you would buy from walmart it is um it&#x27;s been running since january and it is putting out 10 to 14 times the amount of energy that it has taken in anything on the internet about it well mitchell has some discussion on his website about it does he i i must be uh listening this is new energy times huh i guess i was expecting something with steam and uh what about a three-ring circus what&#x27;s happening to the excess energy at this point inside of here i feel like it&#x27;s a small amount for example the input power here is measured in units of um 10 milliliters during the demo is here and it&#x27;s on the order of a tenth of a watt right it&#x27;s not really a whole lot of power these look like the chops you showed when you were at the yeah those are the charts and they&#x27;re very important insurance yeah i i didn&#x27;t show all of them because i needed to focus on the ones that are really the most important huh well this there&#x27;s so little to it well like i say it&#x27;s a little to it but it&#x27;s revolutionary oh thank you very much um and i should talk to another thing that peter hagelson said was he wouldn&#x27;t be able to open this tupperware box for me to look inside because they&#x27;re doing temperature measurements so i just had to believe everything he told me and everything mitchell schwartz is saying about what is inside that box is inside that box and they these two people are very reputable i do believe them one of the reasons i wanted to do this interview is because i want to spread awareness about cold fusion it&#x27;s very confusing right now and it&#x27;s also very exciting because it seems like it&#x27;s reaching a tipping point and yet there are these very intelligent people who seem to deny it even exist peter hagelson said how uh i he didn&#x27;t say this in the interview i saw it online that he had a higher up at mit who actually returned some money that was donated from a company and uh he also wasn&#x27;t very complementary towards the technology of coal fusion and this was very upsetting to me and i thought you know i&#x27;m going to get off my computer chair and try to do something about this the idea of getting in your car and driving to california and back for perhaps a matter of dollars it seems too good to be true it&#x27;s not just peter haggleston and mitchell schwartz that are doing this otherwise i would find it hard to believe there are coal fusion machines surfacing all over the world just look on the internet and you&#x27;ll see i asked peter hagelston if it was true if the technology of coal fusion will be able to tackle the problem of nuclear waste and render it into harmless waste material and he said yes it was and i asked them if it was possible to desalinate salt water and with energy in remote places turn arid farmland into green farmland by irrigating with fresh water and he said yes it was true never mind an unlimited supply of energy it&#x27;s not a matter of if it&#x27;s going to happen it&#x27;s just a matter of when it&#x27;s going to happen to all you politicians out there 90 some percent of us want this to happen we don&#x27;t want an oil-based economy and political system and all the war something is happening every week now it&#x27;s very exciting that plastic box contains so much hope cold fusion has already given me something i don&#x27;t have to wait any longer cold fusion has given me hope my bye oh bye bye oh you</p>
