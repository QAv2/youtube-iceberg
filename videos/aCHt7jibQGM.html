            <p>what&#x27;s the difference between geometric algebra and Clifford algebra I&#x27;ve been asked this question many times so I thought I would address it here while some people say that geometric algebras are just real Clifford algebras I disagree I consider Clifford algebras over other rings to be geometric algebra&#x27;s as well and I generally see geometric algebra in Clifford algebra as being mathematically identical however I will admit that there seems to be a difference in how people use this same mathematical object people doing Clifford algebra focus on the algebraic aspects focusing on how it relates to other algebraic structures meanwhile people doing geometric algebra focus on the geometric aspects especially those that arise from the grading inherited by the exterior algebra but in the end I do still consider the two of these to be the same thing</p>
