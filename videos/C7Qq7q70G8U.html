            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>I so a couple years ago I got a book called the owl told the truth the antigravity papers by Richard Crandall and there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in here about a lot of different theories and he basically says and he goes through some has a very interesting theory about relating Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic equations to gravity and he goes basically some of the concepts or that a cone a spinning cone made out of aluminum or copper or bismuth shaped he doesn&#x27;t give details or exact specifications but this is just a 45 degree taper on here anyways a comb spinning in a magnetic field should produce gravity waves and separate negative matter from positive matter which is a theoretical concept in physics which I won&#x27;t go into here but in fact I&#x27;ll just open up the book to the page here before I actually do a demonstration and here are some of his drawings and on page B b70 and he&#x27;s just showing here that with the comb the graviton magnetic or gravitational magnetic lines of force cause the separation of the negative and positive mass rings in a spinning in this case well it&#x27;s a comb compared to just a cylinder and I don&#x27;t know if anybody out there has read this book or not if not you probably don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about and that&#x27;s okay I guess so and there&#x27;s just lots of theory and stuff here and it seems to kind of make sense it&#x27;s a really good theory and so but what I&#x27;ve done here is just my curiosity has caused me to kind of take another maybe a last stab at this idea just to kind of see if there&#x27;s any validity to what he&#x27;s saying in that book and I don&#x27;t have specifications and so what I&#x27;ve done is just these are ceramic magnets here just attached on to the center here on my lathe and cut this aluminum cone out here and that was one of the materials that he specified as being because aluminum has an unpaired nucleon in its in its nucleus and it has to do with I won&#x27;t get into all the details but it&#x27;s in the book but anyways here I&#x27;ll just power this up and we&#x27;ll see what happens this here this is just a cheap scale digital scale so it&#x27;s saying right now it&#x27;s saying zero grams if you can see that so and I&#x27;ll just kind of show you here so if I push down on the glass plate you&#x27;ll see it so it&#x27;s pretty sensitive so the idea here is that from what I understand of the theory is that this should emit gravitational shockwaves and cause ideally this thing to as it spins it will produce a force like a gravitational force as as the positive and the negative matter in the nucleons and the nucleus separate and it&#x27;s some theory in in quantum physics or particle physics or something anyways enough talking here I will get it going and you&#x27;ll see what happens this lathe goes up to 2500 rpm so let&#x27;s just see what happens here alright looks like nothing happened in this experiment and whether that proves or disproves this whole theory well I don&#x27;t want to say either way but in this particular experiment it just seems to demonstrate there&#x27;s no conclusive evidence that anything in the in this theory is gonna shock waves as they hit matter should create a force right as as they so that&#x27;s my thought on it as pod Knopf has demonstrated and some of his experiments where he was able to create a gravity beam from electric discharges there&#x27;s a couple things about this experiment one is that if it doesn&#x27;t make gravity waves if there is some effect here that&#x27;s I can&#x27;t detect it with what I have so that&#x27;s maybe a possibility and the other is I don&#x27;t know the specifications or parameters that would work in this because they weren&#x27;t given it&#x27;s just presented a theory you</p>
