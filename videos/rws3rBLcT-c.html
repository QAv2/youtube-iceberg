            <p>do you have any reason to believe that there&#x27;s a so-called Legacy program wherein nhi technology from Crash retrievals has been obtained and attempts at reverse engineering has been or is being pursued well a program like that crash retrievals and so on and and deep analysis I mean this is something that if it&#x27;s occurring you know is still behind the scenes and highly classified however I interacted with uh the various Intelligence Officers who&#x27;ve been uh given the job officially actual official jobs to dig out what&#x27;s true about the so-called Legacy programs and crash retrievals and so on people like uh David grush who appeared before uh Congress under oath and uh he made the statement that in fact there is a legacy program we do have access to crash retrieved craft even crash retrieved uh biologics knowing him and where he came from he was at the national reconnaissance office uh National geospatial Intelligence Agency at the highest level of clearances he interviewed as he claimed in his uh statement before Congress over 40 individuals Over a four-year period period and all this data was collected together and it seems like there is that crash retrieval program so although I can&#x27;t say that I personally have been absolutely briefed on the crash retrial program I&#x27;ve interacted with people like grush and many others uh who I I just simply can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m not hearing the truth so I would I would put my stamp on the eye that there is such a program</p>
