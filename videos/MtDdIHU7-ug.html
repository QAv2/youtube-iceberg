            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p> TRAVIS: It got to  2,000 feet high  but this is showing it  only at about 150 feet or something. So, I&#x27;ve taken the Lunasonde data that we got last year,</p>
<p>and there&#x27;s the rocket launches.  -BRYANT: They do line up.  -TRAVIS: Yeah. Look at that scapula. That is a tooth that bit</p>
<p>all the way through. It would have to be larger than a wolf. That is a dire wolf, which is an extinct species. THOMAS:</p>
<p>Look at this tree right here. It looks charred. TRAVIS: We got a dead animal right here! -THOMAS: Oh, What is that? -BRYANT: What is that?  NARRATOR:</p>
<p> There is a ranch  in Northern Utah.  It is considered the epicenter  of the strangest and most  disturbing phenomena on Earth:  animal mutilations,  bizarre UFO sightings  and unusual energies that have  proven harmful to humans.</p>
<p> For 20 years,  the federal government  tried to find answers  and failed.  Now a new team  of dedicated scientists,  researchers and experts</p>
<p> has taken over.  They are determined to solve  the mystery and reveal... ...The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.</p>
<p> KANDUS: Thanks for  meeting with us today.  BEN: Absolutely. We&#x27;d love to hear what you found out about those samples of</p>
<p>the dead things we found in the river.  BEN: Okay, all of it  was very interesting  and kind of  some unexpected things.  TRAVIS: Last week,</p>
<p> we made a bunch of  strange discoveries  in Dry Gulch Creek,  which borders the south field  of Skinwalker Ranch.  These included a scorched tree where nothing else around it was burned, and the decayed carcass</p>
<p>of some kind of animal with huge fangs, so we couldn&#x27;t wait to hear the scientific report on the samples that we sent to biologist Ben Woodruff at the Hutchings Museum Institute in Lehi, Utah.  So, I want to show</p>
<p> you some pictures from the olive wood tree that was burned,  and the burn  looked a little strange.  I can&#x27;t 100% confirm this,  but the way the burn happened  looked like pyrolysis,  which is where a burn happens</p>
<p> without combustion, and without burning through any oxygen.  So, if you were to witness it, it would just be turning black in front of your eyes without a flame.  Then the question is,</p>
<p> what is making heat hot enough to create a non-combustion fire and have no oxygen? Well, you&#x27;d have to have an extreme -heat source. -Yes. I&#x27;m thinking about</p>
<p>that post we found. I was just exactly -thinking about that post. -Yeah. Which is right where we saw that silver orb coming toward our game camera.</p>
<p>-It is, isn&#x27;t it? -BRYANT: It is. THOMAS: Huh, look at this. We got a burn mark.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> In 2022, Kaleb Bench and Thomas Winterton  noticed a fence post  in the south field  with a half-circle-shaped  hole through it  and burns that were  just like the olive tree  that we found  nearby in the creek.</p>
<p>And then, after setting up game cameras to keep a better watch over that area,  we captured an image of  a silver orb  in the middle of the field.  But was it connected</p>
<p> to the scorched fence post  or even the olive tree? Man, I find that really interesting.  BEN:  Let me show you next, the jaw sample, the canine that you found.</p>
<p>ERIK: I want to see this.  TRAVIS:  About six months ago,  a dead cow was discovered  near the south field  that had</p>
<p> massive teeth marks in it. BEN: The size fits into that hole perfectly.  TRAVIS:  And last week,  Ben suggested that one animal  with teeth large enough</p>
<p> to make those sized wounds  could have been a dire wolf,  which went extinct  about 10,000 years ago.  What&#x27;s even crazier than that  is a story told by  the Sherman family,  who lived here in the 1990s,  that they actually saw a dire wolf attack their cattle. So, we were all on</p>
<p>the edge of our seats to hear what Ben had to say about the dead animal we just discovered in the creek bordering the south field.  BEN:  I want to give you</p>
<p> a couple of examples here,  some comparative anatomy.  So, this is the side view  of a typical coyote skull.  And I want you  to focus down here.  At the bottom,  you can see this bulge</p>
<p> is not very big.  This is the part of the jaw  that undergoes the most stress  when these teeth here  are crunching down. So, keep that in mind. Keep the shape in mind.</p>
<p> This is a regular,  modern-day gray wolf.  And they&#x27;re  tackling larger prey,  up to the size of moose  or even a buffalo.</p>
<p> And you can see  how much larger that is.  And this is a dire wolf.  You can see down below here  how much larger that bulge is.  -TRAVIS: That&#x27;s huge.</p>
<p> -THOMAS: Yeah.  BEN:  Here is the dentition  on your jaw.  That has the much thicker,</p>
<p> larger bulge  like a dire wolf.  TRAVIS: Look at that. What? Are you kidding me? KAELEB: No way.  BEN:</p>
<p> I don&#x27;t want  to put out a hypothesis,  but if you handed me this  and said, &quot;Hey, what is this?&quot;  Everything I&#x27;m measuring,  everything I&#x27;m looking at says it looks like it has dire wolf in it or is a young dire wolf.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m hoping we can do a DNA test.  THOMAS:  If we can prove  this is a legit dire wolf, that would be</p>
<p>the first physical evidence that we&#x27;ve been given from anybody  that suggests that  the Shermans actually saw  a dire wolf trying to pull  their cows through the fence. We love everything</p>
<p>about your approach, Ben, and I-I am... I am so grateful for everything you&#x27;ve shared with us. KANDUS: Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for coming on and sharing your results with us. We&#x27;ll collect more samples and hopefully -talk to you soon.</p>
<p> -BEN: Great. Thank you. I look forward to coming out again. -BRYANT: Thanks, man.</p>
<p>-THOMAS: Thank you, Ben. -See you later. -Talk to you soon.  -BRYANT: Wow.  -TRAVIS: A dire wolf.</p>
<p>KAELEB: Well, we&#x27;ve got Jan back out, guys. -ERIK: Hey, Jan. -Hey. Hey, guys.</p>
<p>-Welcome back. -JAN: Thanks for having me back.  TRAVIS:  After our meeting  with Ben Woodruff,  we welcomed ground-penetrating</p>
<p> radar expert Jan Francke back to help us with another one of our current investigations,  between the area known as  the triangle and the mesa, where we&#x27;ve detected a possible underground structure. We had a team come out</p>
<p>and do a balloon-based deep penetrating radar survey. -Okay. -We also have some -magnetometer data from a few years ago... -JAN: Yep.</p>
<p>...that shows magnetic anomalies. -Okay. -Which suggests that we&#x27;re looking at something metallic, possibly even</p>
<p>a tunnel of some kind. Okay.  TRAVIS: Over  the past three years,  we&#x27;ve conducted  a magnetometry scan  as well as an aerial</p>
<p> radar scan in this area,  and both of them identified  a possible metal tunnel  running underground between  the triangle and the mesa.  So today, Jan is going to use a special ground-penetrating radar device  to get us more data</p>
<p> and help us figure out  if that could really be true. Our ambition is to do a survey in this area under the triangle. Absolutely, we can do that. Yes.</p>
<p>Well, guys, so, this time I brought a much deeper penetrating system-- I&#x27;ve improved it over the last year-- that will give us a much higher resolution.</p>
<p>Perfect.  TRAVIS:  Jan is going to scan  back and forth across the area in what&#x27;s called a push broom pattern.</p>
<p> As he does this,  the GPR will send  radio signals into the ground  that bounce off of  objects or structures.  If any are detected,  the device will  produce an image on  what is known as a radargram.</p>
<p> Now, while Jan&#x27;s GPR  is mainly designed to  send radio signals  into the ground,  some of them will  actually go up,  meaning that he could also  detect things above him.</p>
<p>That would be a good thing for us because we&#x27;ve documented a lot of anomalies above the triangle. So, if anything passes over him, we might able to image that, as well.</p>
<p>We got another experiment on the other side of the ranch, so we&#x27;re going to leave you and Kaleb here at it for a little bit, and we&#x27;re gonna head over there. Sounds good.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Well, good luck, guys. -Okay. -JAN: Got it? All right, let&#x27;s start assembling it.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> While Jan and Kaleb were  running the GPR scan  -at the triangle... -And off we go.  ...Me, Thomas and Dragon  went about a half mile over to  the east field to conduct</p>
<p> a different experiment  to follow up  on something strange  that happened two weeks ago. Let&#x27;s put the launch pad right here. We were conducting a</p>
<p>drone-based infrared lidar scan  when Jim Royston suddenly  began losing GPS data  at very specific spots  above the east field. -ERIK: Uh-oh. -What happened, Erik?  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Something that  we couldn&#x27;t explain  was blocking the GPS signal. -Let&#x27;s go launch this thing. -Okay.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> So, we&#x27;ve decided to launch  rockets equipped with  GPS devices  up into those same dead spots  to see if we could get  repeated data, or even stimulate some kind of phenomenon, that might help us figure out what&#x27;s going on in that area.</p>
<p>(beeps) THOMAS: Erik, the rocket&#x27;s armed and we&#x27;re ready to launch. Copy you. Standing by for launch.  BRYANT:</p>
<p> While we&#x27;re out in the field,  Erik&#x27;s going to be  in the command center, watching all of his instrumentation and cameras, to keep an eye on both parties while we&#x27;re out doing this experiment. We might be able to get</p>
<p>to the next spot. -Okay, whereabouts is it? -It&#x27;s up over in... -In that thicket there? -It&#x27;s up over in here.</p>
<p>JAN: All right. TRAVIS: In five, four, three, two, one. -KALEB: Yeah. -JAN: Something&#x27;s going on with the signal there,</p>
<p>very interesting. We&#x27;ve got this weird bump above the ground. -I can&#x27;t explain that. -KALEB: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>What the hell?  ERIK (over radio):  Hey, Thomas, you copy? Yeah, Erik. Go ahead.  ERIK:  I don&#x27;t even know</p>
<p> how to say this.  I saw the rocket launch  straight up in the camera.  But the GPS data went  deep into the mesa.</p>
<p>-(Travis laughing) -BRYANT: That&#x27;s amazing.  ERIK: I saw the rocket launch  straight up in the camera. But the GPS data went northwest.</p>
<p> And raced off  into the interior of the mesa.  It never went up  from the launch pad. -Wow.</p>
<p>-It turned and went that direction.  TRAVIS:  Our latest experiment showed  really weird results  from the get-go.</p>
<p>We all saw our first rocket launch straight up over 1,000 feet in the air.  But according  to Erik&#x27;s GPS receiver  tracking the rocket&#x27;s path,  it supposedly flew</p>
<p> straight into the mesa. Hey, Erik and Travis, if you guys can hear me.  As Jan and I were dragging  his GPR through the triangle,  Jan said about five</p>
<p> to ten seconds  after that rocket launch,  that he was getting something  interesting above us. TRAVIS: Did you hear what he said? That radar picked up something in the air when we launched the rocket.</p>
<p>At the triangle.  KALEB:  I am wondering if we did  have some kind of... interaction or we did get some kind of reading of something moving above us.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s really interesting. I can&#x27;t wait to see that data.  We couldn&#x27;t believe it  when Jan detected something  in the air with his GPR device  above the triangle  after our first rocket launch.</p>
<p> He was trying to find  an underground tunnel, but,  clearly,  some of the radio signals  bounced off something  over his head.  We are ready to launch</p>
<p> the next rocket with the GPS tracker on it. Are you ready?  ERIK:  Standing by for launch.  TRAVIS: We had no idea  what it could have been.</p>
<p>So we wanted to launch another rocket as fast as we could to see if it would happen again.  Hey, Kaleb, be advised  that we are gonna launch  the rocket  in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p> Be prepared. JAN: If we&#x27;re gonna launch another rocket, we should stand still and we watch for it, -and see if we see anything about us.</p>
<p>-Okay. Okay, battery is gonna go hot right now. (beeping) Preparing to launch in five, four, three, two, one. What in the hell is going on? This makes no sense at all! That is not</p>
<p>what that rocket did. I want an explanation for this.  During the rocket launch,  the rocket didn&#x27;t go  straight into the mesa,  but what it appeared to do was to corkscrew on its way up.</p>
<p>Um, the altitude that it is reported to have reached is nowhere near where the rocket actually went.  How is that even possible? Kaleb, you copy?  KALEB:  Yeah.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Erik. Are you still seeing any of that artifact at 30 to 40 feet? JAN: Uh, roger that, I am. Yes, it is definitely there.</p>
<p>And it occurred maybe four or five seconds -after the launch.  -ERIK: Wow.  JAN:  We saw the exact same effect.</p>
<p>Five or six seconds after that rocket launched, we see movement at a range of about 40 feet.  I can&#x27;t explain that at all.  I need to process that data,  but that&#x27;s something</p>
<p> of real interest. Well, it&#x27;s been an eventful day. Heck yeah, it has. Sounds like Erik got some interesting data.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be interested to see what the camera looks like. I-I&#x27;d say this is a very successful day. Yeah, I wo-- I would,</p>
<p>I would think so. I can&#x27;t wait to see what Jan got down at the triangle. I say we pack up, we get back -to see what he&#x27;s got.</p>
<p>-I agree.  BRYANT:  Good job, everybody.  -TRAVIS: Hey, guys.  -JAN: Come on in.</p>
<p>ERIK: Before we jump into Jan&#x27;s data I want to look at some rocket launch data with you guys. I want to show you the GPS data for that first flight.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m excited to see what you got.  TRAVIS: The next morning,  we couldn&#x27;t wait to see if Jan was able to find evidence  of a tunnel underground  in the triangle area. But first,</p>
<p>we really wanted to review the GPS data from our east field rocket launch when Jan&#x27;s GPR device simultaneously detected something above ground at the triangle. Okay, so, you tell me... ...what&#x27;s wrong</p>
<p>with this picture? (laughs) The rocket went straight up to 2,000 feet. Mm-hmm. And you see these points over here? They&#x27;re inside the mesa.</p>
<p>-Now. -TRAVIS: There they are, look at that. ERIK: Look exactly where they went in.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Wow. THOMAS: That&#x27;s right where we saw the UAP last year go into the mesa. That&#x27;s a good point.</p>
<p>The entry point right there. Crazy, man.  The GPS data shows  this rocket flew straight  at the mesa  and directly into a spot  that we call the &quot;in point.&quot;  Now that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ve seen</p>
<p> a UAP enter  the east field mesa  and then exit it  a half a mile away  before disappearing into thin air near the triangle. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing the GPS errors, but it is obvious that something has</p>
<p>prevented us from getting accurate data on Skinwalker Ranch. KALEB: And at the exact same time, Jan was picking up those radar anomalies. TRAVIS: That&#x27;s right,</p>
<p>Jan had the GPR set up when we did this launch, and he picked up uh, something in the sky that seemed to be 40 feet above him over the triangle. Yes, exactly, we can actually see that on this data set.</p>
<p>-Yeah, let&#x27;s take a look. -JAN: Okay. So, the radar&#x27;s continuously running, it&#x27;s taking readings ten times a second. Now what is the radar</p>
<p>really detecting? It&#x27;s detecting changes. And we&#x27;re in an open field and there&#x27;s no cows or anything else moving. So if we just stand still and nobody moves, then there shouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>be any changes at all. So, what I want you to do is take a look at the bottom of the screen, okay? So here&#x27;s what&#x27;s interesting. The launch happened-- I happened to get the timestamp off of it-- right here.</p>
<p>Okay? About six seconds later, five seconds later, we have this blip. It&#x27;s probably sitting around 40 feet above the ground. And that&#x27;s a very,</p>
<p>very strong blip. Okay, now what does that mean? Okay, something changed and created an interference. TRAVIS: So we launched a rocket a mile away from you, and, uh, you detected some sort -of anomaly, uh...</p>
<p>-JAN: Yeah. -...happened about 40 feet above you? -JAN: Yeah. Well, I assure you there</p>
<p>was nothing above us, but... -nothing that we could see. -Nothing that you could see, yeah, that&#x27;s right. -JAN: Exactly.</p>
<p>-ERIK: Right, that&#x27;s the point. And I saw that, and I was like, &quot;What just caused that?&quot; And it happened twice, if I remember correctly. JAN: That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>So here&#x27;s the interesting part. Repeatability, right? That&#x27;s how science works. Check this out. So we&#x27;ll go along in time</p>
<p>and it happened... again. -Right there. -TRAVIS: Wow, look at that.</p>
<p>JAN: This happened after your second launch. So that means, somehow or other, launching a rocket in the east canyon field down there, somehow at the triangle, we detect</p>
<p>an electromagnetic disturbance. Well, no, we detect an object. -We detect an object. That... -JAN: That appears</p>
<p>and disappears. That appears and disappears for just a few seconds. What on earth is that? ERIK: Well, now that&#x27;s a good question And I&#x27;ve got something</p>
<p>to show you that I think you&#x27;re gonna find really interesting given what we already know about this anomaly. This is a camera that&#x27;s positioned right on on the observation point</p>
<p>there on the tower, here in the east field, looking off towards the west, right there at the triangle. I want to see if you spot what I spotted when I played through this. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa! Was that it? That was fast, whatever it was. ERIK: Let me take it back. Is it just one frame? Uh, no, there are several frames here.</p>
<p>So you&#x27;ll see it enter the field of view from the right. And I&#x27;ll tell you why I find this interesting. Okay, we get to this frame.</p>
<p>-(key clicks) -And it&#x27;s gone. What? Yeah.  KALEB:  It disappeared right there.</p>
<p> THOMAS:  It disappeared right there. What on earth is that? THOMAS: So how many frames? ERIK: Okay. We can count them.</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: One. Uh-huh. -ERIK: So there&#x27;s your first. BOTH: Two, three, four, -ERIK: Five.</p>
<p>-What in the world is that? ERIK: You know again, just for added context, remember, Jan was out there at the triangle. KALEB: Well, I can point out right where we were standing right here.</p>
<p>We were right down in here. ERIK: Wow. TRAVIS: What phenomenology could-could suddenly</p>
<p>get a rocket trigger there that you would detect with the radar? You have no speculation, right? I have no speculation.  TRAVIS:  They say seeing is believing, but it was totally unbelievable that just seconds after we launched a rocket in the east field yesterday, Jan Francke&#x27;s radar device</p>
<p>detected something hundreds of yards away above the triangle.  And at that exact same moment,  Erik&#x27;s surveillance camera  captured images of a UAP  coming from the east field  and then disappearing  right above the triangle.</p>
<p>THOMAS: So look at where it&#x27;s at, right there in the middle of the screen, and if you come straight down that would be exactly within the bounds of that black hole in the lidar data.</p>
<p>As soon as you started pointing that out, that&#x27;s what hit my mind, Thomas, you&#x27;re right. It is absolutely right over where the hole in the lidar data is.</p>
<p> As scientists, Erik and I have  to be very careful  when analyzing data, but we couldn&#x27;t deny what Thomas pointed out. The UAP disappeared right above the triangle.</p>
<p>This is where we&#x27;ve documented all kinds of strange phenomena over the past few years. Oh, we got a malfunction. Everybody watch out.  Including a mysterious blob  that seemed to cause</p>
<p> a rocket to explode. -What is that red circle? -Whoa.  TRAVIS:  Infrared lidar images</p>
<p> of a circular ring  with a black void  right in the center.  And another  doughnut-shaped anomaly that we detected just last week. Could these things help explain</p>
<p>what caused this UAP to disappear above the triangle yesterday? And if so, what in the world could they be? BRYANT: It&#x27;s just more evidence that there&#x27;s something above the triangle and we got to do</p>
<p>more work out there. Yeah, for sure. ERIK: So, initially, you know, we were looking for GPR returns from underground, so, Jan, what are the takeaways? JAN:</p>
<p>So I want to go back and show you some things that stick out in the radar data.  TRAVIS:  After what Jan showed us</p>
<p> above the triangle, we had no idea what to expect from the subsurface scans he conducted yesterday in the same location  where previous magnetometry  and radar surveys  have identified possible voids  or even metal tunnels  between the triangle</p>
<p> and the mesa. So just at high level, what are the takeaways? JAN: When we look at the data what I want to show you is we did get some interference right here.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what that is. It could be a void, it could be a metal object, it could be really anything, but it is different than that surrounding material. Where is that? Uh, right-- if you can see</p>
<p>the gray marker on the map. Right about there. TRAVIS: Oh, wow. So it&#x27;s really interesting</p>
<p>that the returns you have seem to kind of point -in a general area... -Yes, absolutely. -...right in that location... -Yeah. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>...where the Lunasonde data point is. JAN: Yeah. TRAVIS: That there is something</p>
<p>giving you a return. JAN: Something&#x27;s going on there, absolutely. Wow.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> Repeated data is exactly  what Erik and I look for  in our experiments. So for Jan&#x27;s GPR survey to confirm that there could be something strange underground between the triangle and the mesa, right where two previous</p>
<p>subsurface scans did, too, is incredible. The question now is, what the heck could it be? We have the rumors that there&#x27;s an underground base out here. -I know that. -TRAVIS: But that&#x27;s</p>
<p>just a rumor, we have no evidence of it-- unless maybe this is evidence of that.  ERIK:  This area,  just to the west  of the triangle,  seems to hold secrets</p>
<p> that I would love to discover. Perhaps it&#x27;s got some relationship to all of the strange things that we&#x27;ve seen at surface level. Yeah, I think that we need</p>
<p>to, uh, get our drill out there and probe it and poke it, and see if we can-- Get a sample back from it is what we need, whatever it is. Whether we bring in a geotechnical drill, that we&#x27;re just doing</p>
<p>a core sample down and seeing if we find something. I think a core sample would be great. This is an accessible spot, so...</p>
<p>-TRAVIS: Let&#x27;s do it. -Yeah. ERIK: Well, Jan, your work has born more fruit than I was expecting.</p>
<p>Both in the sky, it sounds like, potentially, as well as in the ground. So we appreciate you coming out and doing this work, and we look forward to having you come back to follow up.</p>
<p>-My pleasure, I enjoy being here. -TRAVIS: Yeah, absolutely. -Yeah. -No, it&#x27;s-it&#x27;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely more work to be done. -ERIK: Yep. -TRAVIS: Well, thanks, guys. -Let&#x27;s get to it.</p>
<p>-BRYANT: It is awesome.  JAN:  Love it. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Erik, this is Kaleb.</p>
<p>Letting you know I have Snowshoe  and we are heading  to the triangle now. Copy you, Kaleb, we&#x27;ll be watching for you.  ERIK:</p>
<p> So today,  we&#x27;re bringing out Jeremy  with Snowshoe Engineering back out on the ranch. He&#x27;s been here before.  We&#x27;ve identified points  where we want Jeremy  to place his rig</p>
<p> and take some core samples.  We have the Lunasonde data,  we have Jan&#x27;s GPR data  or ground-penetrating  radar data,  and we have this magnetic  survey that was performed. All of them seeming to indicate  that there&#x27;s</p>
<p> something exceptional  beneath the ground just  to the west of the triangle,  and that&#x27;s where  we&#x27;re drilling today.  You guys ready to do  some drilling? Yep.</p>
<p>We are ready. Yeah. ERIK: We very well may be coming into something that is, that is metallic according to some</p>
<p>of the measurements we made. -Well, we&#x27;ll know it. Yep. -ERIK: Okay, good. I understand you can</p>
<p>go down about 30 feet with that 8-inch bit. Yep, yep, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re ready to do today. As always, you know, when we seem to do these types of activities, just make sure</p>
<p>you take care of yourselves. If you feel off physically or anything like that, that&#x27;s important. Please let us know. There&#x27;s no egos out here.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that you guys are healthy to do your job.  THOMAS:  We inherited a narrative  on this ranch, that bad things happen</p>
<p>when you dig. And while I still can&#x27;t say whether or not that&#x27;s true, I will tell you that I&#x27;ve experienced a lot of bad things shortly after I&#x27;ve dug on the ranch.</p>
<p>I suffered this injury in which  my head became very swollen,  and the thing  about this injury is  that it affected me in a way  that the doctors were  just baffled. It leaves you wondering, you know, what&#x27;s taking place here on the ranch that is causing</p>
<p>these physical ailments. All right, let&#x27;s do it. TRAVIS: Let&#x27;s get rolling! During the drilling operation...  ...Erik will collect</p>
<p> GPS data from a tracker  attached to the drill rig.  We&#x27;ll also be running  our high-speed cameras  that record hundreds of images  per second to constantly scan the area above the triangle  and the drill rig  for anything strange  we might miss in the moment.</p>
<p>Who knows if all the UAPs and possible evidence of portals that we&#x27;ve seen could be connected to something underground? But, hopefully, today we&#x27;ll figure that out. Good? Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Just letting you know, the drill is going. We are in the ground. ♪ ♪ KALEB: I&#x27;ve heard all the stories, too,  that there&#x27;s underground</p>
<p> facilities out here,  there&#x27;s some kind  of alien technology  underneath  the triangle area and so... if there&#x27;s an actual tunnel or tunnel system below Skinwalker Ranch, I think that would be</p>
<p>truly validating.  So I&#x27;m really interested  to see what happens  over the course of drilling. Hey, guys. They&#x27;re hitting</p>
<p>a harder substance. Do you want a core sample? Yes, Thomas. If we can, uh, get both of them over here,  -we&#x27;ll take a look at &#x27;em. -Copy that.</p>
<p>♪ ♪ Hey, buddy. So kind of weird at the bottom of this one. There&#x27;s a hard layer and then a soft layer.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Maybe indicating that we got a water pocket or something under there. Nah... I don&#x27;t know</p>
<p>what it would be, I mean, we&#x27;ll loosen it -and you can check it out. -Okay. JEREMY: If you want to pay attention to what&#x27;s in the shoe, &#x27;cause that&#x27;s where</p>
<p>the weirdness happened. THOMAS: Okay. I&#x27;ll be back.  After being on this ranch</p>
<p> for seven years  and hearing countless stories  of tunnels and caves  and vast, complex  systems underground, could it be that we&#x27;re finally punching through  into what&#x27;s  underneath the triangle? This one may be of interest.</p>
<p>-This is our 30-foot sample. -Okay. And the reason I say it may be of interest is that when Jeremy handed it to me, he told me that this is different</p>
<p>than what they see in most of their drilling. ERIK: Okay. THOMAS: Here we go.</p>
<p>So if you could see, solid, solid, solid, and then nothing. Like they just hit the ceiling of whatever it was, punched through and, and that was it.</p>
<p>So that would imply a void. Yes. ERIK: Interesting.  ERIK:</p>
<p> So that would imply a void? Yes. Interesting.  Thomas is delivering  these core samples  from the drill site  in sections to the table.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re at about 27 feet and...  it appears that there&#x27;s  some kind of opening. I&#x27;m really interested in finding out how big this void is.</p>
<p> And I can&#x27;t help wondering,  what have we hit here  beneath the triangle? It&#x27;s almost like you drove a pipe into a pipe. -Well, that&#x27;s interesting. -That&#x27;s damn interesting.</p>
<p>All right, before we even move that, I want to take a radiation measurement. ♪ ♪ So far, nothing. All right, well,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what, -um, I want, I want to bag these samples. -Yeah. Tell me if I&#x27;m wrong, but it makes sense to just keep punching through to see how far</p>
<p>it goes like that. I think he&#x27;s got the ability to go another 20 feet. -I say let&#x27;s do it. -Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, after all, we are hitting something interesting right there. Maybe I&#x27;ll run over there and tell him to, if possible, let&#x27;s go</p>
<p>with the same hole. Understood, yeah, okay. If he&#x27;s up for it.  I don&#x27;t know  what we&#x27;ve gotten into here, but we&#x27;ve just begun penetrating a very different region</p>
<p>from everything above. So, my instincts as a scientist,  if not my impulse,  is to keep going.  Let&#x27;s find out  how big this void is.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m getting like a really bad metallic... -Taste? -...taste, are you? Or just me? -No. -Really weird.</p>
<p>Do you feel all right? I feel fine, it&#x27;s just like, very metallic-y. MASON: Well, you know what they say, -it&#x27;s a curse to break ground out here.</p>
<p>-BRADY: Yeah. Well, if it gets worse, say something. ERIK: Well, guys, you&#x27;re going</p>
<p>to be interested in this. -Yeah? -I just learned from Thomas... we ran into what is essentially a void.</p>
<p>-Wow. -So I&#x27;ve asked him to keep going, to just keep on punching through to see how deep that runs, &#x27;cause that could explain that point that we saw in the Lunasonde survey and it could line up with</p>
<p>some of what Jan has shown us. So, while we&#x27;ve got it open, we ought to just keep punching down through to see what we get. Sounds like we&#x27;re in agreement.</p>
<p>-Yeah. -Okay. Shut it down, shut it down. While we&#x27;re ready to start drilling beyond that 30-foot mark</p>
<p>that we were originally at, I go over to check on them and see if we&#x27;re ready to get going,  and Brady just told me  that he&#x27;s got a really strong  metallic taste in his mouth. Come on, we&#x27;re going. Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Somebody.  Having been on this ranch, I&#x27;ve experienced that before, and for me personally it&#x27;s been accompanied by some serious health issues, so I&#x27;m really concerned at this point. So you-- Are you--</p>
<p>Like, are you feeling okay? No, I feel completely fine, it&#x27;s just the really, like, strong metallic taste I have in my mouth. -Dragon! -I feel completely normal.</p>
<p>-When did you first... -It&#x27;s been about an hour now. THOMAS: Oh, shoot. Hey, guys? TRAVIS:</p>
<p>What&#x27;s happening, Erik? -Dragon! -BRYANT: What&#x27;s going on? THOMAS: We-we have a safety issue we need to address right now. -Is something happening?</p>
<p>-What&#x27;s going on? BRYANT: I don&#x27;t know. Thomas is just on his way over. Well, um...</p>
<p>He-- Look, he&#x27;s... -He&#x27;s feeling fine. -I feel perfectly fine. But he&#x27;s had-- For the last little while, he&#x27;s had a really strong</p>
<p>metallic taste in his mouth. ERIK: Oh, oh, whoa, whoa. -That is a very strong sign of something going on.</p>
<p>-Yeah. ERIK: And have you been right over there -right next to the rig or on it? -Yeah, I&#x27;ve been running it.</p>
<p> ERIK:  Brady, from Snowshoe, is describing metal taste in his mouth, and I recognize that right away as one of the potential symptoms of exposure to a very high magnetic field, among other things.</p>
<p> Like increased levels  of radiation.  I don&#x27;t know exactly  what the cause is,  but this is concerning. I think we should quit</p>
<p>talking about it and get him off the ranch. I agree. I agree, I agree. ERIK: Hey, guys, you want to help me take some instruments over and take some local readings? Maybe we need to go</p>
<p>measure the gamma&#x27;s -and stuff over there. -All right. -I agree. -Let&#x27;s go. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know if the legend  about bad things happening  when you disturb the earth  on Skinwalker Ranch is  true or not, but since Brady was experiencing symptoms like you&#x27;d get with high levels of electromagnetic</p>
<p>radiation exposure,  we wanted to take  measurements and readings  with our scanning devices  to see exactly  what may be coming out  of that hole,  and we all wanted  to make certain  we weren&#x27;t in any danger.</p>
<p>Uh... I&#x27;m not getting anything significant on the gamma ray. No, I&#x27;m getting exactly the same reading as I got over there</p>
<p>on our table. -It&#x27;s not gamma rays. -ERIK: Okay. So, so, I don&#x27;t see anything here to account for what he is experiencing.</p>
<p>TRAVIS: Me, either. You know, just because we&#x27;re not getting anything with these instruments doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that there wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>something affecting him. Because it could be, uh, microwaves. It could be anything. -240.</p>
<p>-Oh, it&#x27;s going up. -You got a 240? -Yeah, I just got a 240. -TRAVIS: It spiked. Mine did,</p>
<p>too. -0.3. 0.3. 0.3 right there. That&#x27;s the highest reading</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had today. -So that&#x27;s two times our normal measurement. -And what are you measuring? It&#x27;s a measure of the radiation dose per hour.</p>
<p>So, we&#x27;re-we&#x27;re at roughly, uh, 500 to 1,000 times below anything dangerous. Yeah. I can&#x27;t connect the dots to a metallic taste</p>
<p>in his mouth. THOMAS: So, if I understand right, you guys are kind of dead in the water until the driller comes back, so this is gonna sit as is.</p>
<p>Yup. ERIK: Oh, so you can&#x27;t keep going? -No. -Yeah, so we need to... I did not understand that.</p>
<p>I find that interesting, right? How is it that the one, uh... weak link in the chain is what got attacked or affected and can&#x27;t be here to continue drilling? The critical link in the chain. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>The critical link is right. Yeah. ERIK: I&#x27;m sure this won&#x27;t be the last frustration of its kind on the ranch when we&#x27;re doing</p>
<p>something like this, trying to drill into the ground or into the mesa.  I&#x27;m not prepared to give up  on this location,  but at least for now we&#x27;re  going to have to shut down,  regroup, and figure out</p>
<p> how we&#x27;re gonna go forward. -I&#x27;m starting to taste metal. I&#x27;m not kidding. -What? -I&#x27;m not kidding you. -You&#x27;re tasting metal now, too? Yeah.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not kidding you, I&#x27;m-I&#x27;m tasting it. All right, then you need-- You now have to leave. -Come on.</p>
<p>-All right, let&#x27;s get out of here. All right, just because of this second one, I want you guys to load up. Clear out as quick as you can.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. ERIK: You&#x27;re not gonna believe this. I was standing over there and I start-- no kidding, I started to taste</p>
<p>that metal taste in my mouth. No kidding. Well, you&#x27;re no different than anybody else. We got to get you out of here.</p>
<p> ERIK:  This is bad. -We need to get you out of here. -This is bad. It-It&#x27;s like when you touch</p>
<p>your tongue to a battery. That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve experienced that, is standing next to that rig. Uh, he&#x27;s the second one, so we need to get him out of here.</p>
<p>It could be a phenomenology that we never heard of before. -Right? -Exactly. Let&#x27;s go look at that drill rig</p>
<p>again.  After drilling into a void,  right where  we&#x27;ve detected evidence  of a possible metal tunnel  below the triangle, Erik Bard and driller Brady Davis suddenly had the sensation</p>
<p>of tasting metal in their mouths and had to be rushed off the property. We&#x27;re not sure exactly what caused it, so Thomas and I needed to see if we could figure it out. TRAVIS:</p>
<p>Where was Erik standing? THOMAS: Right here. Like, it&#x27;s something in this area right here. Oh.</p>
<p>Uh, put your hand on that. TRAVIS: Dude. ♪ ♪ That&#x27;s crazy, man. I feel like</p>
<p>my sinuses are getting, like, just like I&#x27;m going up in an airplane. So, I can feel this nerve in my arm right here, all the way up my arm.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Yeah, I feel it, like-- like my skin&#x27;s crawling. This thing&#x27;s highly electrically charged, is what it is.</p>
<p> This is crazy. As soon  as we touched the drill rig, both Thomas and I felt electric shocks. It&#x27;s like grabbing</p>
<p>an electric fence, dude. Then my fingers start tingling. Yeah.  TRAVIS:  So, I got the idea  for a quick experiment</p>
<p> with volt meters to see just how much electricity it was actually conducting. If we measured anything more than a tiny fraction of a volt,  it would mean that  we had drilled into something  very strange under the ground</p>
<p> near the triangle. All right. First touch them together to make sure they say zero. Yep. Now touch the black one</p>
<p>to the ground and the red one to the pole somewhere. Oh, yeah, look at that. Oh, we&#x27;re getting more than a half a volt from there to there, easy.</p>
<p>THOMAS: Where&#x27;s the electricity coming from? Is this putting electricity out? TRAVIS: No, look at that. And there is electricity.</p>
<p>There is absolutely electricity built up on this thing. There shouldn&#x27;t be any, should there? No, not that much, not unless he was drilling into something conductive that had electricity</p>
<p>flowing through.  Now, a half a volt  of electricity  really isn&#x27;t that much. It wouldn&#x27;t even be enough to power a laptop computer or a light bulb.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s the point: this was at least ten times more than there should be. Unless there&#x27;s something artificial down there.</p>
<p>Is it a tunnel? Well, we don&#x27;t know that yet, and we don&#x27;t know exactly what caused Erik and Brady to start tasting metal. Maybe there really is something to the legend  that bad things happen</p>
<p> when you disturb the ground  here on Skinwalker Ranch. Hopefully, those guys are okay. All right, well, I&#x27;m convinced now it&#x27;s electrical. Uh, yeah, I am, too.</p>
<p> TRAVIS:  Amazing stuff, man.  THOMAS:  Yeah, it&#x27;s crazy for sure.  TRAVIS:</p>
<p> We have a lot of data  and high-speed camera video  to analyze,  so once we make sure  everyone is safe,  we&#x27;re gonna regroup  to see what else  today&#x27;s experiments  will help reveal, and then we can decide</p>
<p>how best to move forward and figure out just what really is below the triangle.  ERIK:  If it turns out that we are  dealing with  continuous structures,  anything at all like tunnels,</p>
<p> then that does lend credence to the reports that we&#x27;ve heard of artificial structures, even things referred to as bases beneath the ranch, and we are going to have to investigate deeper what&#x27;s underground there at the triangle and perhaps</p>
<p>in the east canyon area.  BRANDON:  Why do we continue to see  such disturbing events unfold  on this piece of property? What lies in the regions beyond the area of the triangle,  the east field</p>
<p> and even the homesteads?  Will we get answers  by further exploring  the region of Dry Gulch Creek? Will there be additional evidence of potential dire wolves,  or some other type of  strange phenomenon?  Time will tell. CAPTIONING PROVIDED BY</p>
