            <p>Disclosure Day could very well be the biggest [music] sci-fi movie of 2026. And not necessarily because it marks legendary director Steven [music] Spielberg&#x27;s return to the genre, but because this story may prove to be much more than just another alien encounter movie. Co-produced [music] and directed by Steven Spielberg, Disclosure Day stars Emily Blunt, Josh O&#x27; Connor, Colin Furth, [music] Eve Houston, and Coleman Domingo in Out of This World cast. We&#x27;ve gotten some great sci-fi [music] films already this year, including A24&#x27;s Beonia, starring Emma Stone, and let&#x27;s not forget Markiplier&#x27;s [music] Iron Lung. But Disclosure Day has proven to be different from the rest, because behind its sinister plot may lie an even [music] darker reality.</p>
<p>In this video, we&#x27;re going to explore how Disclosure Day may have finally brought Spielberg back into the sci-fi [music] genre. How it captivated audiences during the Super Bowl, and by the end, you&#x27;ll know the looming internet [music] conspiracy behind the film&#x27;s premise and its title that have us all questioning, is it really just a movie, or is Steven Spielberg hiding [music] something? Let&#x27;s dive in. I know a lot of you guys out here only watch the Super Bowl for the commercials, but I only watch it for the movie trailers, and this year we got a ton. We [music] got Scream 7, which brought back the OG cast. The Super Mario Galaxy movie, one of my favorites.</p>
<p>Supergirl, featuring the cutest Superdog ever. Project Hail Mary, basically Ryan Gosling in space. [music] Pixar&#x27;s Hoppers, The Mandalorian and Grou, Minions and Monsters, and even bootleg versions of the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood sequel, The Adventures of Cliff Booth, which made their way around social media. [music] But one trailer stood out, and considering how hyped I was for the Mario Galaxy trailer, that sang [music] a lot. The haunting clicking sound of Disclosure Day&#x27;s Alien still echoes in my ears.</p>
<p>The trailer starts out with a timely announcement, one that not only fits within the film, but hits a bit too close to home in real life as well. [music] There has been a threat to publicly release government material long shrouded in secrecy. Yikes. Remind you all of anything? Universal Pictures has kept this movie under tight wraps. And truth be told, that&#x27;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Movie trailers have had a serious problem recently. They spoil the whole movie before you&#x27;ve even seen it. But Disclosure Day is different because it has to follow one simple horror movie rule. Don&#x27;t show the monster until you have to. We all know that once a monster is revealed in a horror/cifi movie, it kind of loses a lot of its scare factor.</p>
<p>A movie that does this super well is Signs. [music] Remember that Mel Gibson and Walking Phoenix alien movie? You all know what scene I&#x27;m talking about. the one where the alien is finally revealed, but in such a blink and you&#x27;ll miss it way that it doesn&#x27;t lose any of its power over the audience. [music] It seems that Disclosure Day is attempting to emulate a similar feeling. But what we do know is that it stars Emily Blunt, a weather woman who experiences an unexplainable, unearly phenomenon while live on air, very reminiscent of demonic possession.</p>
<p>[music] From the trailer, it seems that Josh O&#x27; Conor&#x27;s character has a sense of what is going on and plans to disclose the information to the masses all at once. &gt;&gt; Full disclosure to the whole world all at once. &gt;&gt; To be honest, watching a trailer like this during such a massive live event like the Super Bowl is quite the experience. Normally, I suggest viewers watch movies and previews in actual movie theaters to get the full immersive [music] experience as the director intended, but I have to say, Disclosure Day is one of those rare exceptions. This wasn&#x27;t just a Super Bowl ad spot.</p>
<p>This was marketing at its finest. In some way, it felt like the trailer was speaking right to us. And maybe it was. Steven Spielberg is the father [music] of sci-fi blockbusters. I mean, come on, guys.</p>
<p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, Jurassic Park. I could go on and on. It&#x27;s hard to imagine the modern sci-fi movie genre without Spielberg. And it seems to me like Disclosure Day is going to expand his list of sci-fi blockbusters even [music] farther. Spielberg has somewhat drifted away from the genre that really put him on the map.</p>
<p>Listen, The Fableman&#x27;s was great, but you have to admit, you&#x27;re glad he&#x27;s making his return to sci-fi, aren&#x27;t you? Many fans have pointed out that Spielberg may finally be returning to his roots with Disclosure Day. And we couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. Here&#x27;s [music] the thing. From the trailer alone, it&#x27;s obvious that Disclosure Day isn&#x27;t an ET. It&#x27;s not even a Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s something else entirely. [music] It&#x27;s darker. It&#x27;s unnerving. It&#x27;s horror. Spielberg may not be the first director you think of when you think of the horror genre, but taking a look at his resume, he&#x27;s got [music] some experience in that area, to say the least.</p>
<p>2005&#x27;s War of the Worlds, for example, includes horror elements. Ready Player 1 included a homage to The Shining. And let&#x27;s not forget Jaws, a horror movie in its own right. And did you know that Spielberg is also rumored to have directed 1982&#x27;s Poltergeist? [music] He&#x27;s credited as a writer and producer nonetheless. Meaning, whether we realized it or not, Spielberg is fully equipped to give us a bone chilling theatrical experience.</p>
<p>As promised, here is the most prominent conspiracy behind Disclosure Day. A conspiracy that has some people convinced that this is much more than a movie. It&#x27;s a warning. Conspiracy theorists speculate that Disclosure Day is quietly preparing the world for a real life alien disclosure event or that the movie itself is the disclosure. Why now? Why this movie? After all, we&#x27;ve had plenty of alien movies in the past.</p>
<p>So, who&#x27;s to [music] say that those weren&#x27;t used to desensitize us to the idea of extraterrestrials as well? Well, there is a reason why this movie in particular is thought to hold some significance. Starting in 2022, Congress held public hearings on UAPs, unidentified anomalous phenomena, better known as UFOs. For the first time, discussions of UFOs were open to the public. This movement sparked even more discussions across the US, eventually leading to the 2025 documentary film title, you&#x27;ll never [music] guess, the age of disclosure, which featured interviews with former and current US government, military, and intelligence officials who claim to have some sort of knowledge of UFOs. [music] For example, in the film J Stratton, a former director of the Pentagon&#x27;s UAP task force, states, [music] &quot;I have seen with my own eyes nonhuman craft and nonhuman beings, [music] but he declined to elaborate further.</p>
<p>Who directed this documentary? Oh, you know, just some guy named Dan Far. Let&#x27;s take a look at his previous [music] work.&quot; Oh, he was a producer of Ready Player 1 directed [music] by, that&#x27;s right, Steven Spielberg. The public has been kept in [music] the dark and misled by a sophisticated disinformation campaign that silenced [music] anyone who attempted to reveal the truth. Dan Farra made this cryptic statement [music] in a previous interview, leading conspiracy theorists to believe that Steven Spielberg has some inside information on the topic as well. And considering the title of his current film reflects that of Far&#x27;s documentary, well, it&#x27;s not too far-fetched.</p>
<p>While he may not be as straightforward as Dan Farah, could he be revealing the truth to us in his own way? [music] Whether it be the Spielberg loyalist, the self-proclaimed conspiracy theorist, or just your average sci-fi enthusiast, Disclosure Day is sure to [music] draw an exceptionally large audience. And good thing, too, because it may have just saved [music] Spielberg&#x27;s box office record from certain death. As of now, Steven Spielberg remains the highest [music] grossing filmmaker of all time, having earned over $10.7 billion dollars worldwide over the course of his [music] career. However, as I said earlier, Spielberg has taken a bit of a break from the sci-fi genre, [music] putting out films like Westside Story and The Fablemans, both of which did flop pretty badly. If Spielberg isn&#x27;t careful, the second highest grossing filmmaker in the world, James Cameron, could creep up on him.</p>
<p>Although just before Avatar 3, he was a whole $2 billion behind Spielberg, he now stands at only 600 million behind Spielberg as of [music] February 2026. I wouldn&#x27;t get too comfortable, especially considering Cameron&#x27;s got Avatar in his arsenal. What do [music] you think? Will James Cameron eventually surpass Spielberg? Is it high time he [music] returns the sci-fi genre, or have you enjoyed his other artistic endeavors? Is there some weird connection between the Age of Disclosure documentary and Disclosure Day? Or is it all merely a coincidence? [music] Let me know your thoughts in the comments below and don&#x27;t forget to hit that like button and subscribe for more theories and [music] conspiracy theories just like these. Thanks again for watching Screen Ray and I&#x27;ll see you in the next one.</p>
