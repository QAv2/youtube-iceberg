            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>there&#x27;s a wealth of peer-reviewed research spanning 60 years on anti-gravity conducted and published by reputable organizations like NASA the American Institute of physics the American Institute of Aeronautics and astronautics and the Air Force research laboratory these studies build upon theories of gravitation quantum gravity and general relativity some of which were initially proposed by Albert Einstein why the fascination with anti-gravity well it&#x27;s because this technology could potentially reduce an aircraft&#x27;s Mass to zero using electromagnetic propulsion NASA the US Air Force and Lockheed Martin researchers have all delved into theoretical studies about altering inert mass now let&#x27;s talk about the tr3bs capabilities</p>
