            <p>e e e malan 370 contact [Music] 120 breaking news tonight A Malaysia Airlines flight with 239 people on board including four Americans has gone [Music] missing I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says now I am become death the destroyer of worlds hey everybody good night and welcome to the stream hope everyone&#x27;s doing well tonight welcome everybody Welcome Aaron welcome Johnny welcome station sham 6 Alex carton DeVos Darby Crash braa Brien Sandy welcome hey Heather birdie nice to see you John hold uh mystical Wonderland good to see you as well seen a lot of familiar faces in the chat salty decimator Kathy D um who else did we get here Evan Howell good to see you uh Gerald nice to see you out there as well Johnny party uh xxxxxx good to see you guys so guys you know what I think and hey Joe how&#x27;s it going going to see you there Andie jalapeno awesome uh I might be drama out I might be drama out stay and Jason good to see you uh I was just in one of these uh UFO Twitter drama streams and you know it stopped being funny I don&#x27;t know if you guys have seen the South Park episode where uh the people have butts on their faces and Cartman sees them and everybody&#x27;s expecting Cartman to laugh and make fun of them and it just it just breaks him I think I might have hit my point where the UFO drama has broken My Funny Bone now I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t laugh at it anymore it&#x27;s sad it was so entertaining for so long anyway okay guys um cheers got the martini going also real quick personal note uh I am exhausted I&#x27;ve been wiped out from doing my job and um doing interviews and doing podcasts with other people including my own podcast trying to edit the stuff I&#x27;m super far behind I&#x27;m getting my stuff out there so I apologize I&#x27;m doing my best out there but it&#x27;s as a oneman show doing all this is is a lot so tonight we&#x27;re just going to hang out we&#x27;re gonna watch Thomas Bearden we&#x27;re GNA watch his rare interview that he did there&#x27;s some I I watched a little bit of this before so I&#x27;ve seen some of it it&#x27;s pretty good and we&#x27;ll go through it so thank you guys for being here let&#x27;s get to the show full screen I am going with the big headphones tonight even though I&#x27;ve got my earpiece cuz I want to I want to hear it and we will take a look but also if you guys are interested in a lot of this I am going to clip up some I think I&#x27;ve got some notes on clipping some of this stuff uh let me just take a look think I do uh yeah somewhere I got to figure out where they are I&#x27;ll probably just take some notes during this whole thing why is it so loud oh I think I know why there we go okay um no still loud weird I just hear myself super loud for some reason maybe that&#x27;ll change it no okay oh there it goes okay it fixed itself weird okay guys let&#x27;s do this thing uh real quick I guess I&#x27;ll do a couple questions this is locked Martini yeah what happened UAP mic I don&#x27;t know some drama all the all the damn weirdos and people in UFO Twitter Community are like turning on each other and it was funny for a little bit but now it&#x27;s just kind of sad uh what is my job my job has been it Healthcare been doing it healthcare for like 18 years I&#x27;m really good at my job actually um and it it sounds a little egotistical but it&#x27;s just the truth is I&#x27;m I&#x27;m probably one of the most skilled people at what I do on the entire planet um just cuz I&#x27;ve been doing it for so so long and uh takes a lot of analytical mindset to pull it off but uh I you know I don&#x27;t know I the truth be is that with all this stuff that&#x27;s happened you know there&#x27;s a lot a lot of opportunities and it&#x27;s hard to go back to a normal job when you have been looking into science and physics that&#x27;s out there I think a lot of people if you&#x27;re new as well before we dig into this uh might think that oh you know Ashton&#x27;s just gone down the esoteric Rabbit Hole or what have you um no that&#x27;s not the case this uh this stuff is true this this science is real that&#x27;s the part that&#x27;s the craziest part about it so uh you know you&#x27;ve probably seen some of my posts I&#x27;m not being overly dramatic I&#x27;m just telling the truth we can manipulate gravity we can uh we can move objects from one location to the other in the blink of an eye uh we can do stuff that seems like magic and I it&#x27;s not just my belief uh we&#x27;ve seen it on multiple videos uh we have engineers and scientists who work for the government who&#x27;s basically either overtly said that or indirectly and then when we went and researched the history of it we found that there are scientists that have been saying it from at least 1985 or before that and it the and the best part is that it all checks out there&#x27;s once lview asked me Ashton why don&#x27;t you write a scientific paper and the crazy part is I don&#x27;t need to they&#x27;re already all out there the Aaron Hoff bone papers already out are already out there uh the paper that I showed earlier today Victor Loch uh lacos sorry I think I said his name incorrectly of high temperature super conductivity it&#x27;s all out there the craziest part about the whole situation is the science is just out there all we need is for people to look at it that&#x27;s it I haven&#x27;t discovered anything new I haven&#x27;t uh revealed any new physics that nobody knew about the stuff is the crazy part has all been out there before so the scary one thing I want to say the last thing before we dig into this is that the thing about it is that we have to be careful about jumping down into all the different rabbit holes that are out there so you know I people again are trying to get me to look at a 911 conspiracies they&#x27;re trying to get me to look at mh37 or mh17 and try to tie that stuff together um there&#x27;s people who want to talk to me about you know connecting all the different esoteric aspects to the this as well that stuff might be true I don&#x27;t know but again like I&#x27;ve always said guys this is already too much I already have a harder enough time getting people to believe information that&#x27;s factually true and factually out there and supported by verifiable evidence so I do hope that when we people finally come to terms with the idea that there&#x27;s an extra Dimension that scalar physics is true that we can teleport an object that people then begin to think about some of those other things and wonder if they&#x27;re true and the reality is I probably won&#x27;t ever into them cuz I this is this is enough man I&#x27;ve got one feather in my hat in terms of MH370 I don&#x27;t need uh I don&#x27;t need to figure out all the conspiracies in the whole world but it does make me question everything and I think that we should always have that critical mindset in terms of questioning everything about our world okay you guys ready by the way it&#x27;s pleasure to do this somebody say something about Tim pool yeah there are a lot of dots guys but we we we need to be critical minded people and very Vigilant in terms of connecting those dots and making sure that when we connect the dots we&#x27;re not just using our own confirmation bias to connect them and that they&#x27;re actually supported by factual information if we do that then I think it&#x27;s fine um but if we are just sitting out there trying to confirm and connect stuff that might not be connected then that makes it really difficult oh wow hey Shelly wow that&#x27;s a big donation thank you very much um Shelly says first time catching you live I enjoy all your research and thank you for sharing it on X you rock thank you Shelly that&#x27;s that&#x27;s really sweet I appreciate that um I haven&#x27;t said this in a long time but um you know thank you for the donations anybody that puts those donations out there if you are a type of person that you know there&#x27;s a lot of people that are struggling in this world and if you need your money please keep it for yourself absolutely but any donations you do uh give to me I will probably use to help increase the production value I have already um kind of hired some people on a pro bono not a pro bono basis but on a side basis ad hoc basis to help with some of the aspects that I that I&#x27;m struggling with with respect to beefing up the stream so that we can stream these on X at the same time as on uh YouTube because I want to have it look a little nicer before I do that but that is coming in the next week or two and I may be looking to hire somebody on the production side to help edit the um hard truths podcast and clip like I don&#x27;t know three segments from each one or something like that to post on social media haven&#x27;t decided um but if you are interested and that kind of thing you can reach out to me via DM or what have you I can&#x27;t pay too much off the bat but if it were to get into something else then you know it might morph into a better job I&#x27;m not sure okay yeah and uh last question before we dig into this is um per pery uh and and once again thanks again Shelly uh pery asks have I watched the one called psychotronics no that one&#x27;s probably going to be on another night I do have that One queued up in the background here somewhere uh and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve watched that one just yet and I have watched most of this so this one will be good so let&#x27;s just get into this guys we&#x27;ve got a lot to do because I would like to see Tesla get some decent press yeah that&#x27;s what we to do I hope we just that well my name is Tom Bearden I&#x27;m a retired lieutenant colonel presently also rather suddenly retired from Aerospace with the Aerospace uh uh steep down uh widespread throughout the country uh I&#x27;ve been doing research for many years into uh several areas one own some of the work of Nicola Tesla one on the area of uh trying to produce both a theory and some practical results for overunity electrical machines uh small amount of work in anti-gravity and in some medical applications primarily in a new kind of electromagnetics I once said Tesla was a d otomy certainly Tesla had certain idiosyncrasies which have been played up and usually any creative genius does if you accept those and don&#x27;t dwell on those Tesla was a magnificent genius in my opinion I think he was so far ahead of his time in what he could do and what he understood not necessarily in the language and the phraseology we use today but in his own language and his own phraseology uh I think he was well ahead of the times 100 years ahead of his times and uh maybe in this conversation we&#x27;ll even go into that if Nicola Tesla okay is what you said he is why is he so relatively unknown to the general public through a whole series of events um you know Tesla in his life story admitted one time he had been a gambler and then he quit because he was a compulsive Gambler the last great gamble that Tesla took he lost and that of course was his great installation uh on Long Island Warden Cliffe he had uh at that time put everything he had into you might say one Kettle uh it was funded by Morgan there was some struggle between Morgan and another uh Finance year who were were in a great struggle with each other they had affected the stock market it created inflation and everything plus Tesla had done a very strange thing as as a gambler he knew that Morgan would never give him his $150,000 that he needed to do the installation that he really wanted to do which was going to cost more than that by some amount so he had designed a smaller installation of two transmitters when he briefed Morgan and he briefed him only on the communications aspect of it Tesla had foreseen as many people had at that time but he had clearly foreseen the broadcast industry sending uh pictures and Sound and Music and so forth and information through the air so Morgan financed the $150,000 based on Communications only Morgan knew of marone&#x27;s work and some others who were racing to try to be the first Wireless as they called it in those days Morgan was uh he didn&#x27;t care about all the Finesse and so forth he was strictly a finance year he was strictly interested in making money and he knew this new area was going to go and going to make money a lot of money for who ever got there first and in his opinion Tesla had the best chance to get there first so that&#x27;s why he backed uh Tesla Tesla however was even more interested in doing a worldwide Energy System to provide energy that would be very cheap for everybody in the world anywhere on the earth and so the actual installation that he started building was this Giants installation so well known to the Tesla fans and people who read of Tesla in the struggle between Morgan and his counterpart his counterpart almost bought Morgan&#x27;s uh Railroad Company right out from under him he bought uh in fact control of the voting shares of the preferred stock but not of the common stock and Morgan issued orders from Europe to buy all the stock that could be bought at any cost in one day the stock made astronomical jumps uh the whole stock market went crazy we don&#x27;t have anything like that in our time inflation became suddenly rampant parts and electrical things went up three times for example and suddenly everybody Furnishing Parts uh there was a panic because of the money shortage and everything and the stock we would today call it a crash in other stocks um so what happened is they begin demanding all their money up front to the very beginning are you saying that Tesla was forgotten after Warden Cliff that it was Warden Cliff that ruined his reputation well it was a combination of events there were many people who resented Tesla particularly among the academic Community uh number one they didn&#x27;t understand at all how he worked uh he didn&#x27;t have the academic credentials what they regarded the high academic credentials they had he of course had academic credentials he certainly was had been very vocal that the common electromagnetic Theory which he usually referred to as the Herz Theory and the Herz waves since Herz you know proved the Maxwell predicted wave uh Tesla was adamant that uh there were no transverse Maxell Herz waves in The Ether and that he Tesla was you not using that kind of theory at all that theory was very limited and did not apply to what he was doing in other words he what he was saying to the entire scientific mind of the day was that what you&#x27;re doing gentlemen is erroneous not only that I&#x27;m proving you&#x27;re inera but because he had become a household word when you do you become a single name Tesla not Nicola Tesla you see and because of this kind of effect he had become essentially the great wizard he had given us the AC power system and everything and there was a great deal of resentment for what they regarded as an upstart inventor who was in fact essentially saying uh I&#x27;m going to usurp your science they would interpret it that way not all people were detractors but many were he also was not a great theoretician he didn&#x27;t feel he didn&#x27;t fill up books with great theories and full of mathematics uh and so he just didn&#x27;t practice the game as it was being practiced he was ostracized I think primarily because of his difference and because of his radical statements and because of his pronouncements of great systems they didn&#x27;t have the foggiest notion of what he was talking about he had one other unfortunate incidents which today would would laugh at but was very serious at the time I think it was 1901 I&#x27;d have to check my records he picked up radio signals from space you know we know today of course that planets radiate uh RF noise and so forth but when he announced this it was uh it just caused a sensation and all the scientists said immediately what a c you know what a idiot so an unfortunate reaction occurred in the scientific community that he had to be an utter coup because everybody knew that there were no signals from space and that was an unfortunate timing and contributed to his demise Nichol Tesla also had an ego very big and um there there&#x27;s some argument for the fact that his ego or his vision of self may have undone him as well could you address that at all yes that&#x27;s quite true he was arrogant um he he knew in his mind what he had done and what he could do he had done the experiments for example in his few months at Colorado Springs which proved that he was on the right path and he was hastening back to New York to get the funding from Morgan and set up his uh Warden cliff and get on with doing the wireless but also the the other energy at the same time he was going to do it all in one stroke and when this uh Panic came along and supplies went up and U finally he made the final fatal mistake he briefed Morgan in desperation that what he was really about because he thought Morgan would appreciate that he simply did not understand a finance year who&#x27;s not interested in all of that but what is it going to do to make me money there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s the way Morgan approached it at that point Morgan also knew that Marone was closing in on it and very close to transmitting Wireless across the ocean the Atlantic so uh Morgan knew at that point briefed on what yet had to be done and how much money Tesla needed and all that he knew the game was lost from a community ation Viewpoint that Marone was going to be first so at that point Morgan in his own mind wrote it off as bad a bad investment going sour and one thing he did not do was throw good money after bad a perfectly Sound business decision today we would say so he simply wrote the project off Tesla could never understand for some months there after what had happened why he couldn&#x27;t get the extra money people be began to quit work because he couldn&#x27;t pay them the suppliers wouldn&#x27;t send him his supplies because he couldn&#x27;t pay them UPF front and the whole thing began to sort of grind to a halt he did get the installation in operation but he never succeeded at what he was doing and by that time Morgan was never going to finance him again uh a combination of events then occurred and within a few years of that to where uh suddenly things began to ship the jealousy of the scientific Community began to suggest that he was after all just a c everybody knew that thing on Warden Cliff was foolish and so he became almost a nonperson in the space of a very few years uh older man living in a hotel room uh feeding the pigeons with all his idiosyncrasy he really did have idiosyncrasies he had a morbid fear germs he would use something like 17 white napkins for a meal that he would have and meticulously lay one aside once he made the first wipe with it to wipe his hands or whatever he he had a lot of idiosyncrasies and of course his autocratic pronouncements uh as you say his ego also was there he also had quite an ego and so people just shuttled him aside and said well he&#x27;s at best an e egomaniac who&#x27;s mistaken and at worst he&#x27;s just a lunatic and they simply wrote out of the books uh what he had done i f e e e e e okay well I was just muted that whole time my God chat I was muted that whole time chat you didn&#x27;t let me know my God okay people who are watching the stream I&#x27;m super sorry about that I did not me to do that oh I need a producer guys okay I&#x27;m going to say everything that I just said while I was on mute right there um so I just wanted to oh my God it&#x27;s like three minutes of me just ranting on mute okay I apologize people on the stream I do this a lot Eric thank you very much man appreciate you for being here Eric Hecker is in the chat Antarctica um the reason why I think Eric is on point with the stuff that he&#x27;s talking about is that that I feel like he&#x27;s a normal guy like me that was pushed into an extraordinary situation where he found out information that he felt like the world had to know the answer and he was in a position to know it I think the reason why the world struggles with the story that he&#x27;s been telling regarding Antarctica is because we have been so blinded by what is out there and hidden right in front of us this whole time that we just can&#x27;t believe it to be true and you can look at the MH370 case that I&#x27;ve been looking at and people have the same reaction they think there&#x27;s no way that we can potentially have teleported or warped an object from one location to the other it&#x27;s just so far beyond the Paradigm and for a lot of people directed energy weapons are so far beyond the Paradigm but what we were just looking at right there with Tesla you can tell that Tesla was also the type of person that was looking so far beyond the Paradigm that people JP Morgan was investing in him and that they knew the investors knew that this was going to change the whole world that we were going to have stuff like television radio all this stuff that you know 100 years ago and I&#x27;m pretty sure that predates radio people would have thought as magic the stuff that we&#x27;re doing right now people would have thought of as magic but Tesla was out there and he knew conceptually what was going on and what what did that do to him it made him a Marty so to speak or it uh you know they essentially vilified him they thought he was a crazy person um and this goes to show how science really works science is a matter of making huge leaps and when you have discoveries discoveries aren&#x27;t a matter of like oh you have to advance your civilization so far before you realize it it&#x27;s just a matter of people that are uh freethinking people who are forward-looking and taking risks and so I think that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s great about Tesla and once again I want to thank Eric uh in for being in the chat um Eric I I didn&#x27;t see your email back I did email you so I know that&#x27;s the real Eric since uh Hecker because he mentioned that I had an email that I sent him so I don&#x27;t know if you can send me another one but we we need to connect for sure because I would definitely like to talk to you uh about your experience in Antarctica and anything else that I can do to help to get the information out there I think there&#x27;s a very clear cross in terms of the science that explains stuff like directed energy weapons and also weirdly enough teleportation of a large object I think it all comes down to scalar physics and to goes all the way back to Tesla and the scary part is how long have we had this stuff out there and how advanced has it gotten in the last 100 years behind the scenes so let&#x27;s keep watching focused in on the electromagnetics because early on in my work I also became disenchanted with the present electromagnetics model to understand Tesla you must take seriously I think his suggestion that the present electromagnetics model is seriously flawed nobody wants to take that seriously most of the people who approach Tesla use the conventional electromagnetics and when they cannot explain what he was talking about they say therefore the man was a cook now suppose for a moment that he really was correct Suppose there is something wrong with the classical electromagnetics of course you can use the classical model to do the things we do but it means there are many other things that can be done that we cannot do because we have excluded that part from our model and from our teaching and from our knowledge and from our instruments let&#x27;s pursue that a moment the original electromagnetics written by um Maxwell himself was written in an algebra called Quan uh what we mean here is a higher topology algebra in which you can do things in this kind of expression of electromagnetics that you can&#x27;t do in vectors or tensors now the real theory that Maxwell had depending on who counts the equations and what they count uh is something like 20 equations and 20 unknowns to give some numbers to it when heavyside got through translating it into a much simpler algebra called vectors which he helped create and he wrote all the modern equations that are used as Maxwell&#x27;s equations not Maxwell himself none of those ever appeared in anything by James Clerk Maxwell When heavyside modified it to a much easier algebra called Vector analysis which he helped complete the algebra itself it consisted of some two equations or so with an extra equation thrown in depending on the way you want to count that again certainly if you want to count the full thing four equations so you can see a remarkable reduction in the amount of VAR ations of things you could do and that&#x27;s what I mean when I say we previously had an electromagnetics that permitted lots of functioning that is no longer permitted by the kind of electromagnetics we all taught to apply and use today it&#x27;s a subset of what can be done a scientist brother named Barrett a very brilliant scientist has done a very good analysis when Herz announced his discovery of the actual waves it&#x27;s in there if you read it but actually Tesla went to seah Herz to convince him of the era of his waves and showed him experiments and everything else to prove that the wave that was actually in The Ether was not a transverse string wave but in fact was what we today we would call a longitudinal sound wave a wave of RAR faction and compra uh compression he did do that and was not able to convince Herz but Herz was was very disheartened by all this evidence that Tesla had given him but never revealed what the evidence was let&#x27;s look now and see if there&#x27;s any room for what Tesla was saying and I want to tell you a story of the greatest joke on all of Science in all of history because you&#x27;ll never understand Tesla till you know this joke when they were trying to write the the wave equation for the plucked string wav of course they were studying plucked stringed instruments you have a taught string suspended between two points you know in the body of an instrument and they simply pluck the string various ways and watched the waves they then wrote equations for the tensil forces and so forth in the string they isolated the string they assumed that there&#x27;s nothing else happening but the string and using the forces and they teach the sophomore students to do it this way they derived the string wave equation first of all there is no such thing as a tight string independently existing apart from a holder anywhere in the world there never will be there is however a tight string which has equal and opposite forces and the ends of the holder that&#x27;s holding the string and creating the tension on the string if you will apply the same approach and ask your s the full question what system was perturbed it was not just the tight string it was the tight string plus the body of the instrument what comes about is that every transverse string wave that occurred in the string an equal and opposite highly damped wave occurred down in the body of the instrument every guitar picker which I&#x27;m a very poor one knows that the body of the instrument vibrates when you pluck the string you depend on the characteristic of that for your sound what happened though by throwing away the holder and the anti-wave in the holder every time a mathematician or a physicist writes a wave equation he has thrown away half of the problem of the phenomena the anti-wave still exist but he threw it somewhere usually into a highly damp system and ignores it the way he gets by with that at the end where he has now described his reactions with the single wave equation the transverse wave equ equation the other wave reappears and he says oh that&#x27;s Newton&#x27;s third law reaction force because it&#x27;s always equal in opposite well Newton&#x27;s third law is not a law it&#x27;s a description it is not a mechanism for what causes something at all if you add back in the wave that is missing guess what you get you get equal and opposite waves in the vacuum these waves are in fact longitudinal waves they are more sound like intestinal is right and all the textbooks in the world are wrong and now let&#x27;s turn that make sure unmute here Kaboom Tesla was right all the textbooks in the world were wrong uh need to clip that for sure uh 17 minutes in I was actually planning on clipping that earlier today and fell asleep um but Tesla was right need to make sure I note that now what did he just explain there very important Concepts is that when heavy side redid the equations now when we take a string instrument like a guitar and I pluck it like this is it just the rubber band or the string that&#x27;s vibrating no my hands are as well the sound is based on the structure of the instrument not just based on the string it&#x27;s also based on the thing that&#x27;s holding in the string so the same concept applies here to a wave flowing through SpaceTime so to speak is that it also depends on the ether that it&#x27;s flowing through as well and this is the thing that Tesla understood that has been Rewritten from our equations and I think this equates then to our B field equation where they just set it equal to zero they just simplified the equations and what this did was this made us not realize the nature of our reality we&#x27;ve been teaching electromagnetism incorrectly for 100 years pretty incredible from Talking sound let&#x27;s turn it to electromagnetics if I examine an atom and I see the complex assem of dipoles each dipole being the electron charge and the piece of the positive charge of the nucleus I find something very similar to the holder and the string that is I have something very light the electron which is perturbed and I have something which is highly damped the very heavy nucleus by the equal and opposite anti-disturbance and we still know that exists but we call it Newton&#x27;s third law we just invoke a description have no idea what causes it but anyway if the wave comes in from the vacuum and is intercepted by one of these dipoles in addition to the disturbance the string wave that we will see off of the uh electron in we will have the anti-wave The Recoil forces on the other in and so always we get equal and opposite we do get the opposite wave and what came in from the vacuum had both the separation between the two charges caused the separation of the two waves just as the separation between the string and the body of the instrument cause the separation of the wave and any wave in the plucked string instrument so we still have the same thing and we still hold to the fact there is a longitudinal wave in the vacuum not just a single transverse wave now let us see what happens when we launch a real quick so what he just said there is that there has to be an equal and opposite wave for everything that&#x27;s happening and I I hope I&#x27;m saying this correctly based on my interpretation here again not a PhD but that when we pluck the string there&#x27;s an equal and opposite wave that&#x27;s happening in the O the object itself relative to the string now same idea would apply to any type of wave that we create electromagnetic wave that we shoot through SpaceTime there&#x27;s going to be equal and opposite one in the the instrument that&#x27;s holding it the instrument that&#x27;s holding it is The Ether the underlying framework of the reality itself so there&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re not seeing there behind the scenes is essentially what he&#x27;s saying wave now that we know that from an antenna when I launch away from a physical antenna the matter in the antenna is made of these same atoms in these same dipoles and in addition to launching the wave from the electron shells and the electron interactions there is a highly damped anti-wave launched at much less uh disturbance highly reduced of the anti-wave but as soon as it emerges from the antenna there is no longer any damping because there&#x27;s no longer any heavy nuclear mass and so immediately it pops to full shape and full size and so we still have the longitudinal wave and the vacuum that we launch can I prove that in what we receive yes indeed I can and you must understand this if you ever understand Nicola Tesla now let me go to the reception of this wave in a circuit and I have some pre electrons in my circuit and then comes the wave from the vacuum the electrons in the circuit are pushing against their brothers down the road which pushes back and it&#x27;s restrained it had very difficult for it to move longitudinally we know that today we know that it only moves down the wire at something like 11 ft per hour the signal that moves down the wire at near light speed will have completely exited the solar system and Gone on by that time so as you can see we have a very sluggish electron restrained which is spinning we know today when they wrote those equations they didn&#x27;t even have the notion of the electron so it acts as a gyro and by gyro Theory right out of the book when you longitudinally disturb a gyro that&#x27;s restrained it will press sideways and all of our instruments measure and detect the electron precession waves that&#x27;s what we put on our oscilloscopes and what we read with our instruments and yes indeed gentlemen we do detect the electron wiggle waves and they are transverse waves but a gyro reaction presses at right angle to the actual disturbance which proves that it is a longitudinal wave in the vacuum if you do not believe that you must throw away all gyro Theory Tesla was right every textbook in the US is wrong Maxwell simply assumed out of thin air the transverse string wave because that&#x27;s what everybody was familiar with when he wrote the first equations and it&#x27;s never been changed to this day so so was Tesla aware of this and is this what Tesla was talking about when he talked about telforce okay there we go okay guys I&#x27;m just nerding out a little bit because we got erer in the chat and I this is just it&#x27;s nerding me out because is I had never talked to Eric hacker before but when I watched him and here&#x27;s here&#x27;s my true opinion I&#x27;m just going to be 100% honest when I saw his interview on Sha Ryan six months ago when this investigation first started I thought no it this can&#x27;t be true is that really is that how it works I had no idea I was still full on like my old thinking and then I started investigating like how could we actually teleport an object what would be the science that would support it and I met people that knew Thomas Bearden the guy that we are watching on the video right now knew him before he died he died a couple years ago and they didn&#x27;t even really lead me to Thomas beard and I think I just I uncovered it through other information digging through the science and the moment I started watching about scaler physics I went holy Eric Hecker is Right Eric Hecker nailed it and people don&#x27;t realize and you know what I appreciate Eric you&#x27;re in the chat you know what I appreciate about what you said the most is that the battle that we are waging is an information War about getting the information out to people in a way that they can accept it and I constantly think about when you were on Sean Ryan and you said directed energy weapons is a a word that people need to get into their vocabulary that&#x27;s a really great way to put it because it resonates with people people think directed energy weapon they can understand that when you dig in a lot of this scaler physics a lot of people check out now people in my chat MH370 X they they&#x27;ve been following along for six months they&#x27;ve been watching the Journey of how we&#x27;ve been going like we started with just legitimate like how does a circuit work and we&#x27;re now at the point where we&#x27;re looking at scaler physics out here and I am 100% certain this is legitimate and I know not just from what we&#x27;re watching but from what literal contractors that work on special access programs have told me behind the scenes the people that I&#x27;ve interviewed that what they&#x27;ve told me and that it lines up with what people have already said out there the scary part is this has been hidden for decades absolutely decades and the question is how do we present this in a way where people can digest it and realize that it&#x27;s real I think that the true problem is how do we get people to understand that this stuff is real and possible and the scary part is like I would say Eric has an easier time convincing people because directed energy weapons is now something that people are starting to wrap their brains around the idea of using the same technology to literally teleport an object it&#x27;s not teleportation like Star Trek it&#x27;s it&#x27;s warp speeding manipulating gravity itself to move an object from one location over here to another that&#x27;s a whole another can of worms I mean that is and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s made this so difficult is like trying to convince people of that is a lot harder than trying to convince people director energy weapons which is why Shawn Ryan&#x27;s afraid to talk to me but doesn&#x27;t have any problem talking to Eric but also Eric saw this stuff in the equipment firsthand versus I just saw some videos and it took me you know shamefully 10 years to realize that those videos are authentic and I think people think that oh no those are video game effect they&#x27;re not guys those videos are real and it&#x27;s proven by the science here that we&#x27;re looking at so let&#x27;s keep going I don&#x27;t want to go too much on my soap box here it was deeply involved in it Tesla made several statements for example over and over where he said there are no transverse waves in the vacuum no Hertz waves the waves in the vacuum I have already proved he said is like a gas and the waves in it therefore are like sound waves they are longitudinal waves and he was indeed correct today for example in modern uh quantum mechanics there is a vacuum it is a medium and it&#x27;s a virtual particle flux and so indeed the vacuum is a virtual gas by today&#x27;s best physics and and Tesla was right it is a longitudinal wave and I&#x27;ve just explained how it&#x27;s split when it&#x27;s received you do get what we measure with our instruments because of the electron precession and you also get the any wave at the same time proving that it was an extra wave there down in the nucleus in the materials which do recall and we just ignore it we know it&#x27;s there but we just ignore it now let&#x27;s look for example at his statement of Wireless transmission here he was talking of the transmission of energy through the atmosphere or indeed through space uh without loss as a matter of fact if this if that is true then it already exists in nature Tesla had rediscovered nature as a matter of fact today in modern Theory we know that the energy in an electromagnetic wave transmitted is already conserved if you take a wavelength at any length from an omni transmitter and you take the hemispherical shell of that wavelength times the entire surface area of that shell the energy that&#x27;s in that shell is the same as the energy in any other shell of any radius the energy is totally conserved and none of it is lost we already know that that part is absolutely correct the energy density course goes way down as the shell expands so that part is unquestionable now the question is can we direct that and can we control it uh in a sense if we do a laser beam we do that there&#x27;s a better way to do it if we go to Whitaker&#x27;s paper which was written in 1903 and some other papers have been written since then like by zilkowski and by suu in 1993 and Zukowski in the 80s a strange thing comes about what we call the electrostatic scaler potential that is pure voltage to simplify it can be uh broken down into a directional set of wave pairs one wave going one way the other way time reversed and locked on it in space so what we call just voltage or just potential is actually got a hidden set incredible amount of waves going in both directions and not only we consider it just a fixed value at a point in space But as a matter of fact it&#x27;s a tremendous energy flow so what Tesla really discovered was how to combine the waves so that they eliminated the gradients technically speaking the gradients opposed each other but were still there but now hidden the net gradient the net force field was gone we know today the other electromagnetics is still there and we have an energy flow in both directions he just explained phase conjugation chat okay if you don&#x27;t know what phase conjugation is I&#x27;m going to explain it to you very simply real quick uh Dave Rossi has mentioned this several times he mentioned this on the Tim pool podcast that I went on with him phase conjugation is when you get the waves to make love to cancel each other out what he just said right there is this idea that you can get the waves to cancel out entirely now if you try to measure it the electromagnetic field you&#x27;re going to measure nothing but there&#x27;s still something there there&#x27;s still a scaler there this is what people don&#x27;t realize this is what seems like well I can&#x27;t measure it must be nothing there but then if you take these scalers that you&#x27;ve created and then you create an interference pattern scalar interferometry now something comes back again because it wasn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s nothing there we just just cancel them out so he simply found out how to do that and yes indeed there is no loss in that kind of potential if you make a beam of that uh you can IND indeed transmit energy in a completely hidden fashion you can stick a normal meter right in the beam and it won&#x27;t see a thing because there&#x27;s no Force F uh and you can transmit it at a distance uh how effectively depends on the uh ability to make the beam how narrow you can make the beam and hold it together and the other thing depends on a slight interaction with the atmosphere in the middle you&#x27;ll spill a little but you can do it 98% or so which I think is what Tesla said also there&#x27;s one other thing we must say about that there is emerging in the last few years and has emerged in Orthodox science at an advanced level uh what I would say is the very beginning but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s moving pretty fast uh theory of force free fields and these are getting very close to what Tesla was doing they haven&#x27;t added the any way back in yet but they&#x27;re getting close at least they&#x27;re eliminating the overall force and doing something else with the electromagnetics That Remains the other thing which must be brought to bear and I must do this very precisely to understand Tesla is the fact that for example if you read Jackson classical electrodynamics you will find when he&#x27;s first setting out in the first so many pages he points out very clearly that this Theory this very beautiful Theory only only holds when the background is reasonably well behaved reasonably linear he points out that if the background becomes nonlinear that you must then turn to the emerging field or the field that has emerged in nonlinear Optics nonlinear Optics in some Fashions is an unfortunate term because uh the mechanisms are fundamental they apply to all frequencies and they apply to all kinds of waves it&#x27;s a matter of when the background gets sufficiently nonlinear to induce these phenomena so as long as you continue to try to keep the background linear which we&#x27;re great at doing we try really to sweep out these phenomena Tesla had stumbled into this area very early on and mastered part of this area long before the terminology I&#x27;m using existed he knew how to do number one what today we call phase conjugation he knew how to do what we call pumped phase conjugation and he even knew how to do what we call Tech technically today amongst very few people self-targeting YSI chat make sure you are paying attention to this phase conjugation pumped phase conjugation and self targeting everything we see in the MH370 videos can be described by what we just saw here and what we just listened to now when we talk about our coherent matter wave imagine us taking a bunch of strings and I&#x27;m going to take a couple rubber bands here just to uh show you guys what I&#x27;m talking about so I can visualize this now we take our V our strings here these are our electrons okay let&#x27;s just imagine these are strings because I don&#x27;t have strings out there and they&#x27;re flowing freely in every random Direction out there now what do we want to do to these electrons we want them to cohere with one another how do we do that how do we take a nonlinear thing and make it linear we weave them together we weave them together and now we turn them into a coherent electron wave and what happens to them their spin changes they go from half spin particles firion to full integer spin particles bons if you would want to think of it like that and what happens when we have a force we get an equal an opposite Force so if we get a one spin electron wave then we get a minus one spin corresponding electron wave that goes along with it and the minus one electron spin wave is potentially our force that we need in order for anti-gravity to manipulate to bend SpaceTime itself so he had some tools at his fingertips which he could use on the lab bench and build equipment he worked on an enormous number of years on which could do things that the normal electromagnetics cannot do we do some of them today in nonlinear Optics now let me talk about self-targeting so you can understand some of his transmission without loss one of the problems we have like for example in something like missile defense if I have a spaceborn laser let me say and I have a rising enemy booster 10 15,000 mi away I&#x27;ve got a problem I&#x27;ve got lots of power I can put the laser beam onto the booster but I must hold it on one particular spot 15,000 mi away on that exact spot a long enough time called dwell time to burn through the casing and destroy the booster so I have a problem how do I hold this beam there and keep it from wandering around on the body of the booster well it turns out you can do it very easily with a thing called self-targeting every signal that comes from there if I phase conjugate and transmit a phase conjugate replica it goes unerringly back to the spot including it laded a little bit because the component of its motion was on the beam that came to me and so if I continue to do that iteratively I can hold the beam exactly on the uh booster and burn through it so by targeting I can hold a laser beam on a point it doesn&#x27;t have to be a booster a defense or anything I can hold a beam of energy onto a point that I have at a distance that&#x27;s the main thing by self-targeting and on my own opinion I reached the opinion that Tesla in his tele geodynamics had discovered how to do that with the mechanical waves first of all he could transmit the full way through the Earth and he could cause the thing when it came back to be face conjugated once he had a reflection from anywhere he could narrow immediately into that point and put all his energy to that point and today there is a theoretical basis for it uh I couldn&#x27;t build such equipment but I mean there&#x27;s a theoretical way to go to do that and apparently according to his statements that&#x27;s my interpretation of what he was doing he was doing iterative phase conjugation and therefore able to focus his energy regardless of what kind of Route it followed to the exact point he wanted it to go to on the other side of the Earth chat holy crap did you guys just listen to what he just said he just said that we can create a targeting mechanism that can track an object in motion no problem whatsoever now if you want to know what phase conjugation really means imagine that you&#x27;re shooting a light beam onto a mirror it&#x27;s going to bounce off of it at an angle but instead of bouncing off at an angle it bounces directly back at the target at the speed of light this is how you can track an object as well you can imagine very easily that if you can do that where instead of bouncing off the object it it bounces directly back this is the idea of radar and if you can do phase conjugation this is what begins to enable all the magic out there because the phase conjugation can also then cancel out our wave our herzan wave essentially the electromagnetic uh waves become perfectly counter one another they make love and all of a sudden now what do we get we get something called order effects we get an effect that we pre previously did not have at all that going on and we might not be able to see it and the only way we can&#x27;t see it is because there&#x27;s a Fifth Dimension that we don&#x27;t perceive where that wave is TR is transmitting through longitudinally not transversally like this but longitudinally like a sound wave like a perturbation Through The Ether okay let&#x27;s keep going now was this theoretical or was this ever demonstrated I believe he demonstrated it uh for example my personal opinion and I certainly cannot prove this in a court of law and I want to label it as a personal opinion uh my personal opinion because of certain time sequences of some of his statements and incidents which actually happened I think as a last desperate measure while his uh installation at Long Island was still intact and still in operation I believe he fired the electrical pulse of energy that blew down that forest in Siberia Oliver Nicholson has done some very good work for example to look at the admittedly circumstantial evidence we can&#x27;t prove it at all I just happen to hold to the thesis that it was his last ditch effort to try to solve his problems that he&#x27;d lost with Morgan by focusing attention onto the absolute power that could be Unleashed with this and it failed nobody was interested I was very curious about the time correlation between his installation still existing on Long Island still in operation and this Siberian uh particular blast and its characteristics which it was not a nuclear weapon it was not a meteorite so uh in doing a little work on that thanks uh to Oliver Nicholson he sent me some very good information on that and uh it&#x27;s not the kind of thing you can ever say with any certainty happened certainly not but uh there is at least circumstantial evidence that he may have done that in speaking of nuclear energy and Tesla&#x27;s objection to it and um some of the things he had in mind with energy uh it&#x27;s pretty obvious that Tesla not only knew how but advocated very strongly that you could do this electromagnetically and you could do it cleanly and cheaply without U all the nuclear residue and the nuclear waste and the long-term effects and this kind of thing you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s tough to dispose of nuclear waste now I I have mixed feelings on this uh for example I am a nuclear engineer I have a master&#x27;s degree from Georgia Tech but I&#x27;m not a practicing nuclear engineer nor have I ever been the Army really didn&#x27;t see fit to let me do that nonetheless I know a little bit about what they&#x27;re about and so forth and a nuclear power plant is not a great breakthrough in technology at all it&#x27;s a great heater and what we really do we use the nuclear reactions to produce heat and we either boil water and make steam or we just use the hot water and then it&#x27;s the heat energy that we must convert uh to provide our electric power now the demand for electric power is great enough it&#x27;s a big enough problem as everybody is aware if we must continue to furnish this electric power uh at our present science level there&#x27;s no really acceptable alternative yet to the nuclear power plant however it doesn&#x27;t mean that that&#x27;s the preferable Solution by any means I think it&#x27;s preferable the other way which is why I work so hard to try to do it electromagnetically now at this very conference that we&#x27;re at when this interview is being made I&#x27;m going to introduce what is almost the final results of my 30 years of work in this area and what we have done is very similar to what Tesla did and he provided the codes the clues on which to look what I&#x27;ve done okay now this part that he just mentioned right there uh this is really interesting guys a nuclear reactor is just a heater we take that heat energy and we convert it to electricity why is that important just think about that concept for a second does that seem efficient no would would be much more efficient if we can produce Electrical uh energy just directly as opposed to heating something up and Tesla realized that we could do this without all the nuclear waste and byproducts that are out there does that remind you of any other technology that we&#x27;ve looked at recently chat how about the thunderstorm generator using plasmoids in a car engine to produce zero exhaust and to create cold fusion where elements are actually fusing together to form higher uh Pro proton elements that we wouldn&#x27;t think would be possible like what Bob Greener showed Eric if you&#x27;re out there and you&#x27;re watching I think you should also take a look at Bob Greener and Malcolm bendle&#x27;s work as well I got a super creepy letter that wanted me to find Randle Carlson and M Malcolm Bendle and I did and I found out about this thunderstorm generator and it&#x27;s real too and it&#x27;s not a direct link between all of this but I think that there&#x27;s a lot of Technology out there that has been brushed aside as being potentially fake where people like Tesla and other scientists that came before knew knew that it was real uh and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s scary man cuz I sit there and I wonder this is the last thing I&#x27;ll say we&#x27;ll get back to the video is that what would these people do to hide this would they kill people I think in today&#x27;s day and age it&#x27;s much harder I listen to General Flynn and he says that well it&#x27;s harder to kill people now because there&#x27;s so much forensics and if you were to do that you have to bring more people in you have to silence them they can figure out what happened exactly they can tell whether or not it was suicide Etc I think in if we had lived in the 1950s doing what we&#x27;re doing right now I think that Eric and myself would have been silenced instead they use disinformation they discredit people that are out there they make them seem crazy and what have you that&#x27;s how they keep the stuff hidden that&#x27;s out there that&#x27;s what they did to Malcolm Bendle as well and they attack their past and these skeletons they have in their closet they&#x27;ll dig them up and they&#x27;ll use them against them uh and and this is what is like wow how much stuff have we had out there and how have they kept this secret for so long let&#x27;s keep go oh and also what would they do to hide this would they convince some kind of debunker that hey some DOD produced asset is has a similar Edge pattern and I&#x27;m going to use that to debunk like a whole video using one frame or convince some type of VFX expert that he should go out and make a video to his millions of followers that says this thing is a perfect match or that they found some picture that they took that they have no Providence for whatsoever and convince them that hey go tell the world that you took this picture and that somehow a two-dimensional picture is in a 3D video where you have accurate lighting and clouds that match in two different videos that are in perfect synchronization yeah absolutely they would go do that to hide this information that&#x27;s the minimum they would do to hide this information so I want people in the chat just to keep that in mind as we go forward with this technology and you think this isn&#x27;t real that&#x27;s totally fine I&#x27;m not trying to convince you that this is real I just want you to know that it is and the thing about it is that you cannot hide this forever so at some point the people like Eric Hecker the people like myself the people like Tesla the people that came before us will be Vindicated in the eyes of the science guaranteed is uh taking him to heart and convince myself with a lot of investigation and study the waves in the vacuum are longitude so when electromagnetic waves break loose from their mass restriction and holding they are longitudinal waves and when they get tied up in Mass they get split into these two waves which one of which is acting upon the electrons to cause them to move sideways and they slip a little bit every once in a while down the wire creates Newton&#x27;s third law reaction in the nucleus well when you go through enough analysis of this what you really find and what as of Friday of this week uh yesterday I have filed uh my associates and I I should say have filed a very fundamental patent on the creation in a circuit of longitudinal waves to flow the the uh energy freely literally in the Tesla fashion and then use it separately in a load to power a load technically it&#x27;s still called displacement current what we have done we have split the normal current technically dqdt into two comp components one being displacement current dfdt and one being that mass slippage every once in a while of these pressing electrons down the wire and what we really have done is used a a barrier invented by Bill Fogle to stop the mass flow which is all the workflow the rate at which energy is being lost in the circuit we allow only the flow past fogal semiconductor which is a patented device patented in 9 to and then we use this free energy flow which is does not disperse conventional Theory already recognizes displacement current as pure energy transport without losses for example the way to use it and I want everybody to know so they can check it if I then run the displacement current through the primary of its stepup Transformer I produce ordinary Garden variety magnetic field and store that free energy in that magnetic field that couples to the secondary which then couples to the electrons in that circuit through the load which are now free to move I don&#x27;t restrain them and I pump the electrons through the load absolutely conventionally and do power in the load so what I have is absolute conservation of energy but I do not conserve work loss the dissipation of the energy I take the energy in almost freely from the battery or power source in this case it would be an oscillator cuz I&#x27;m speaking AC we can do a DC I strip off and block the component of the current that&#x27;s responsible for all losses in the circuit then I take the displacement current and I couple it gather it and store it in this case magnetic field couple it to the other side and discharge it through the load completely separately none of my load discharg current goes back through my source no degradation is done to the source and yes indeed you can legitimately do overunity electrical systems and it&#x27;s exactly analogous to a heat pump which is a proven overunity system that we use in our homes Chad this is the only time I&#x27;m ever going to say this on a stream so pay attention right now this is the technique that I think that people that are out there that are producing over Unity are using that exact technique that you just heard I&#x27;m not going to go into more detail about it based on information I know behind the scenes but there it is right there overunity is possible he just described it to you there you go 35 minutes into this I just told the world how to build a free energy machine is what I told okay now if we assume that what I&#x27;ve explained about the way we have approached um the use of the energy which is freely available from the vacuum vacuum energy is now acceptable even in physical review Thanks to some fine work by people of the stature of Hal POF for example is very very straightforward very technical and in his now an acceptable thing we know the vacuum and it is accepted is filled with energy and Tesla always said that it was so once again Tesla has been Vindicated by modern quantum mechanics after all of these years I think uh if we look at some of the other incidents um as for example Tesla talked about being able to tap the energy of cosmic rays he talked um in fact his nephew reported as a child r in in the car where Tesla had put in um an engine of some kind which was self-powered so we find then later references to Tesla which suggest the harnessing of energy from today we would say from the vacuum so does that sound reasonable to us today from where I&#x27;m coming from yes indeed because that&#x27;s exactly what we have done we take it uh in the potential across the source we simply use the hidden wave flow from the Whitaker St stuff we want to extract that and use it in this displacement current form while it&#x27;s still energy flow and none of it&#x27;s being lost we do not wish to make work until we store it up and discharge it in the load separately we do it just like a heat pump and I really think that&#x27;s probably the way Tesla did it in that car engine he also knew there was enormous energy in what was called cosmic ray and he connected that with the whole idea of the energetic vacuum we would say today and I think that&#x27;s just one of the ways he referred to it uh for example we know from T Henry Mor&#x27;s work that he was inspired by Tesla&#x27;s statement that the the energy of The Ether itself was literally filled with rivers of energy free for the taking it inspired him and his great undertaking today the fashion is to sweep that aside and say well you know I know what he was doing Tesla just didn&#x27;t know you he was using this stuff that I know all about and so I talk about the Earth ionospheric wave guide and resonance and that&#x27;s not what he was doing at all you can&#x27;t do free energy for the whole world with Earth ionospheric resonance it isn&#x27;t going to happen we know about that you know it isn&#x27;t going to happen you know another area that often occurs in discussions of Tesla is the notion of weaponization of Tesla&#x27;s true work that&#x27;s relatively unknown to modern science but could probably be known to some very sharp people that looked into it because they wanted to make weapons he Tesla certainly spoke of a very large series of very powerful weapons I think that&#x27;s a reasonable thing and let&#x27;s approach it this way certainly I&#x27;m on record is saying the weapons exist and that several Nations have weaponized them let me explain a little bit about what I&#x27;m talking about and a little bit key points where you might look we know for a fact that for example T Henry moay with his power supply was visited by the Russians and we know that the Russians tried to in fact take it they even tried to kidnpped T Henry moay and so we know that the Russians very early on were interested in things like free energy right out of the vacuum and they were interested in weapons there are even reports that they contacted Tesla and I&#x27;m sure they would have he certainly had plenty of headlines so if we have that then as a a starting point we have a situation where in the late 30s particularly and just prior to World War II there was at least some kind of interest in contact we know in the case of T Henry Mo they very probably got the exact blueprints out of build the device maybe a couple things missing in here and there but a really good lab could have eventually put it together from there then comes along World War II the big interrup Interruption for everyone okay at that time um after World War II we have a very strange situation which exists now first thing that exists we have suddenly thrust upon the world scene the atomic bomb if we had not done so we would have had a blood bath when we tried to invade Japan so many lives were saved by the use of the atomic bomb and I am not an atomic bomb apologist many people who are here today would not be here if their fathers had been killed by the invasion of Japan and depending on who you believe the casualties would have been about 1 million on our side alone anyway we arrived at this state in the world where now there&#x27;s a very powerful weapon which suddenly frustrates one of the things that Stalin has planned to do Stalin of course had a spy in the atomic bomb project he knew we were getting ready so it wasn&#x27;t a big surprise to him okay I want to make a quick comment here on this part and this is the reason why not only do I post about science but I also post about geopolitics Thomas Bearden just said that the atomic bomb saved millions of lives that if Japan had invaded the United States millions of people would have died that&#x27;s a guys you need to think about that definitely need to think about that there&#x27;s multiple aspects to this one is that absolutely the death toll would have been huge from a land invasion of the United States but also think about why we use weapons of mass destruction we use weapons of mass destruction for the greater good people ask the question why do we not just break out our orbs that can teleport planes or potentially incinerate and or you know vaporize entire cities well because we need to be able to use it for the greater good why do we not use it for in the Ukraine why do we not use it against Putin why do we not use it against um you know China why do we not use it in in uh Israel Hamas cuz those Wars don&#x27;t require it it&#x27;s not for the greater good when you do it Wars are about money so when you understand things like this you start to realize the next time that we will potentially have a huge revolution in technology is when we have to use the weapon again and hopefully we never have to at Potsdam when Truman told him that we had just exploded the first atomic bomb but he had been planning after Europe after the European war and everything wound down he would hold his armies for about two years we always beat our PL uh swords back into plow shars and go home historically it&#x27;s the last war never going to be another one unfortunately human nature doesn&#x27;t change and so there is another one and Stalin in about two years would keep all his armies intact and simply take over Europe in about 6 weeks that was his plan however now he couldn&#x27;t do that because if he mashed his forces we would have bombed him back into the Stone Age so he had a problem there is at least reasonable reason to believe that St Stalin called in his scientific heads when he got back from poam and really laid the law down to them he said the destiny of Communism has been frustrated by this great new American development that isn&#x27;t one more very quick comment right here what did he just say there he just said that Russia was planning on taking over the world but they realized we would just nuke them and that would be the end goodbye Russia we had bombed Japan we said good night Japan I mean look at what we&#x27;ve done to Japan 75 80 years later and Japan is still not allowed to have an external military force we bomb them and won the war instantly That&#x27;s The Power of nuclear weapons so instead what did Russia do Russia said I need to find the next technology whatever&#x27;s Beyond nuclear weapons whatever will render nuclear weapons obsolete I want to figure that out so from the 19 end of the 1940s until let&#x27;s say the 70s maybe even the 80s that&#x27;s what they did that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s about to tell you right now they figured out scalar physics they they went and dug through everything to find out what is the technology that will shift the Paradigm once again that seems esoteric but maybe it&#x27;s not and that&#x27;s what they did here we go watch going to be the last great breakthrough but I tell you you gentlemen one thing the next one is going to be Soviet so he forcefully uh ordered them to search for the next great area in my opinion to look for for that breakthrough because thereafter you find Soviet scientists combing through everything for example they took the entire scientific literature of the West loaded on copies on the boats took it back to Russia set up huge uh translations institutes staffed with very highly qualified scientists and their job was to go through look for anything anomalous the anomalies they laid aside then they went through them with a fine tooth comb and to see what looked promising and of course they would have found such thing we&#x27;ve never done anything like that they would have found such things as the Whitaker papers a lot of marvelous things I haven&#x27;t even found yet that&#x27;s in the literature and nobody&#x27;s ever paid any attention to so my thesis is that that&#x27;s what happened they started into this area for building a new super weapon immediately after World War II certainly they would have resurrected this Moray stuff they had gotten out of T Henry Moray lab through their agent they would have probably resurrected other things I don&#x27;t even know about that&#x27;s just conjecture but probably so at any rate they did start such a program the Russians have always been the greatest nonlinear mathematicians in the world they were at the beginning they are to this day and so they would have seen much more clearly into the non linear aspects of everything we&#x27;re talking about than American scientist had seen to date which means they would have picked up the op what today we call the optical type functioning which means they would have picked up the longitude and waves they certainly falsified general relativity Theory only later many years later that they openly publish the fact that it&#x27;s wrong and show why it&#x27;s wrong and become you know recognized critics of the conventional general relativity in this country country we did exactly the opposite we defended it to the last men so they went much deeper I think during this period into these areas than we did and I think they started building because uh as you know from my own previous Publications I put together independently a rather large body of evidence admittedly circumstantial but real nonetheless of that can only be explained by the testing of such weapons there is absolutely no other explanation for it now I could be wrong on one incident but 200 of exactly the same kind I think not so the evidence is overwhelming and you even hear now their own leaders like zerovski recently has referred to these weapons as the ellton weapons there is no question today that the Soviet Union has these weapons and if what I put together is correct and I&#x27;m absolutely convinced it is three other nations of the world also develop those weapons and resoundingly check the Soviet Union the other three are friendly to the United States not hostile and I think that played one great part in the fall of the Soviet Empire because uh the original Target date as I brought out had been 85 to achieve the freedom to move and do what they wished in the world in 1985 and they met the schedule as I&#x27;ve adequately reported but once checked then we have a very strange situation now communism Falls because of its Financial shortcomings and they just flat can&#x27;t keep it glued together anymore and in the Chad he just said the exact thing that I had mentioned to you guys people wondered well if if the Russia had figured this out why did they not just win the you know take over the whole world two aspects one other countries figur it out as well and they checked them which three countries would have checked Russia right off top of my head I&#x27;m going to guess Germany France and the United Kingdom now maybe I&#x27;m wrong on some of those I&#x27;m literally just guessing off top of my head those three countries that I would imagine would have been allied with the United States definitely France and the UK Germany maybe maybe we took we know we we stopped the war maybe they are allied with us I think they probably were but if you guys in the chat know let me know I want make issue a quick correction the casualties would have been from us invading Japan potentially millions of lives lost we saw what happened when we had um when we invaded Germany uh beaches of Normandy and we didn&#x27;t want that to happen again so we dropped the bomb on them then the other thing economics why did the Soviet Union Fall Apart economics just like Batman Begins movie there&#x27;s a weapon that&#x27;s even more powerful than a super weapon and not just propaganda which is another one but economics economics can cause an entire country to fail here we go dissolution here uh we have entered what I think is a much more dangerous world than anything we ever thought of three other nations today are indeed working on what I call the Tesla weapons or really scalar electromagnetic weapons and these nations are not really friendly to the US at all so it&#x27;s a much more dangerous world that has emerged the nuclear control that was uh executed by the Soviet Union is now probably been diluted uh you can hire if you&#x27;re careful uh you can hire some Soviet scientist right off the project many nations today are developing nuclear weapons and they don&#x27;t have to go through the pain we did they&#x27;re hiring people who already know how to do that and have done so so very shortly you will see emerging throughout U the so-called third world as it&#x27;s so loosely referred to uh you will see nuclear weapons you will see the extended scud for example being developed u in uh North Korea aided by the Chinese and it&#x27;s being expor to the midd East and in my opinion you will see a nuclear and biological warfare in the Middle East in 3 or 4 years somewhere on that time range I could be off a year or two but it isn&#x27;t going to be forever so to me it&#x27;s a much more dangerous world that we live in particularly if we see the Advent in addition to the nukes and the uh biological warfare which is certainly frightening enough if we see the Advent of several other nations now possessing weapons of the ill power spoken of although it a little bit of likely by Nicola Tesla I would like to explain the basis for the weapons CU it&#x27;s open if you take the two papers by Whitaker that I&#x27;m so fond of quoting and all my stuff you will find that the first one tells you if you do it in reverse tells you how to make if you wish a scaler Beam by simply assembling the necessary wave set the second paper will tell you that if you then take two such scaler beams actually hidden multi- waves and interfere the them at a distance yes scalar interferometry really exists it&#x27;s just really multiple wave interferometry when you understand the wave sets what will occur at a distance will be the reappearance of the electromagnetic gradients which we call force fields in other words you&#x27;ll create the electromagnetics at a distance if you bias your ground potential of your transmitters higher than the distant uh focal point uh what we call energy heat energy exhaustion of energy which should be called work heat energy will emerge in the other area and Scatter at that area energy will go in here and scatters work out the other end it&#x27;s just like you had a direct pipeline at a distance is this indicative of Tesla of course if you bias your projectors the other way the energy flows in the other direction in other words you extract energy from out there and the energy you have to do something to collect and dissipate the heat back at the transmitter in every transmitter is now a two-way transmitter of energy I can make it go in one direction by biasing or go in the other at will the we okay guys we have to do a quick sidebar here on this as much as I want to play this through he just explain teleportation um so we can take energy let&#x27;s say at Antarctica where we have our transmitters that are producing 2,000 volts time 5,1 160 different Doms that we have and we can send energy anywhere we want that&#x27;s easy right we move the energy from here to over here over here to over here but if we absorb energy like he just described endothermic event then the energy must go somewhere we can&#x27;t cheat the laws of physics so the way he describes is okay you can absorb the energy but then you have to allow it to radiate back at the at a different location but what do we see in the MH370 videos what have we talked about why did Dave Rossi promote the idea of a fourth orb because the energy is going somewhere else what we see in the MH370 videos is we see the energy being absorbed from one location and it&#x27;s going to reappear somewhere else and when it reappears somewhere else this is the part where the energy is now going to appear at the other location this is the teleportation aspect that we see so we see the orbs converging and now imagine that our transmitters are the orbs themselves we&#x27;re not shooting it at it now we have three interferometers we have three radar dishes so to speak and they&#x27;re these three orbs that we&#x27;re staring at right here so where are we going to send this energy we&#x27;re going to send it to the fourth orb and wherever that appears that&#x27;s where the object is going to appear this is in sense in in some sense an Advan form of cloaking in another sense it&#x27;s literally teleporting an object from one location to another the reason why someone leaked these videos and put in this video the these frames that we&#x27;re seeing right here is they wanted us to see exactly what we were looking at a plasma object that can absorb energy from the vacuum itself to get the energy it needs to produce the effect that we see right here where we see the kulum effect where the electrical engine uh energy is increasing exponentially as the orbs Converge on one another to break the swinger limit and then Ricochet this object from its current location to another location where the energy is going to appear over here that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening there&#x27;s endothermic event this is not video game effects that we&#x27;re staring at this is being teleported to a different location if somebody faked this then they were trying to show us the future and trying to show us what would happen with uh that we would somehow find out about Thomas Bearden in the future and all of this stuff that we&#x27;ve been looking at here today and I just screwed up because here we go I&#x27;m going to try to get back to that patronic [Music] weapons Thomas bu by the way the n it isn&#x27;t going to be forever in the fall of the Soviet Empire because the original Target date as I brought out had been 85 the nuclear control it isn&#x27;t going to be forever so to me it&#x27;s a much more dangerous world that we live in particularly if we see the Advent in addition to the nukes and the uh biological warfare which is certainly frightening enough if we see the Advent of several other nations now possessing weapons of the ilken power spoken of although it a little bit of likely by Nicola Tesla I would like to explain the basis for the weapons cuz it&#x27;s open if you take the two papers by Whitaker that I&#x27;m so fond of quoting and all my stuff you will find that the first one tells you if you do it in reverse tells you how to make if you wish a scaler Beam by simply assembling the necessary wave set the second paper will tell you that if you you then take two such scalar beams actually hidden multi- waves and interfere them at a distance yes scalar and aeromet really exists it&#x27;s just really multiple wave in aerometer when you understand the wave sets what will occur at a distance will be the reappearance of the electromagnetic gradients which we call force fields in other words you&#x27;ll create the electromagnetics at a distance if you bias your ground potential of your transmitters higher than the distance uh focal point uh what we call energy heat energy exhaustion of energy which should be called work heat energy will emerge in the other area and Scatter at that area energy will go in here and scatters work out the other end it&#x27;s just like you had a direct pipeline at a distance is this indicative of Tesla of course if you bias your projectors the other way the energy flows in the other direction in other words you extract energy from out there and the energy you have to do something to collect and dissipate the heat back at the transmitter in every transmitter is now a two-way transmitter of energy I can make it go in one direction by biasing AO and the other at will the weapon implications of that alone are extremely frightening and extremely powerful and now several nations are involved in developing it right straight forward to the hilt very shortly we will have an even more frightening World emerging the other thing you can do with it which I think Tesla alluded to at least in a few cases when you do these things with the potentials rather than with the force fields you actually involve time you produce time effects or you can produce effects on anything that exists in time because you affect the time Dimension when you do this uh you can affect thought and you can affect uh human beings where they live because thought occurs in time it occupies time it&#x27;s just not spatial but it is time time like you can probably see if uh indeed the world has already acquired several Nations the ability to build the defensive weapons in the area that uh has been discussed here the testie weapons then there&#x27;s really no longer a great compelling need to do any further uh weapons work by any private citizen so there are some other very compelling areas however of great need for Humanity that are directly involved with Tesla&#x27;s approach and Tesla&#x27;s work that cry out for research and development two of these areas are are fantastic we must have clean energy sources we must have some source to provide our needed electrical power cleanly and freely without polluting this entire biosphere everybody&#x27;s concerned with that the way to do it is not to put in harsh laws that stop all workers and everything like this and go into absolute dictatorship that&#x27;s not the way to do it the way to do it is to do it scientifically by striking for a great new breakthrough to where it can be done and done cheaply and cleanly so that&#x27;s one area that you know is important and deserves the utmost effort can be put on it another area that is assuming ever more increasing urgency is the area of the medical needs allopathic medicine is failing the bugs are all changing and they&#x27;re becoming immune to all our antibiotics the um the Orthodox scientific people are saying this openly in their journals and their articles and their editorials even the newspaper and Newsweek and so forth are picking it up and writing articles about it uh within 5 years you will have a serious risk of your life if this this trend continues just to go to the hospital uh the number is already over 10,000 per year I don&#x27;t know the exact number since 92 but it&#x27;s already well above 10,000 per year that die in the hospital because the infection that they have absolutely cannot be controlled there is one kind of staff for example that nothing that we have will affect and it has about a 30% lethality I&#x27;m told so three out of 10 who contact that die in the hospital these kinds of things are in increasing uh you now have very well recognized scientists in the in the regular medical scientific Community saying allopathic medicine is failing and there&#x27;s nothing to replace it you cannot develop the vaccines or new compounds fast enough to even keep up with them we have lost that battle we must change the medical approach the medical approach if you use the extended electromagnetics if I may use that term that Tesla was talking about we then occur uh there then occurs phenomena which can be used to control and change and heal almost any infectious disease whatsoever in cure including a genetic disease such as where the genetics have changed in the cells such as AIDS now that is not an idle statement that is a very rigorous statement based on some very rigorous scientific work done in France in the late 60s and early&#x27; 70s by Anan priori and a team of scientists that gathered and worked with him and these were emminent scientists well known for example one of them was Robert kuier head of the biology section of the French uh Academy of Science and also the secretary perpetuel of the French Academy at the same time poelle an emminent scientist World known many such scientists worked with directly with u the inventor antoan priori priori completed his um doctoral thesis which was rejected because of the violent opposition of the medical establishment but he demonstrated under rigorous scientific protocols that you could completely cure almost with ridiculous ease terminal tumors in lab animals he did it hundreds of times uh under all the proper rigid controls I mean uh kuier personally sent his own personal assistant to do the tumor graphs and ensure that everything was absolutely impeccable very simple you take 15 rats uh 30 rats 15 each one control group one test group every all the rats get inoculated or grafted with the same terminal tumor they&#x27;re going to be dead with 100% certainty in 30 days the 15 get treated the other 15 don&#x27;t they stay in exactly the same room same food same everything the 15 treated all get well the 15 not treated all die with another provision you can then take another group of 15 rats with the same tumors grafted to them you can take one drop of blood from each of the rats that got well and put in eat one of the other rats and they will all get well from that single drop of blood the ordinary medical establishment was Furious when they changed the setup of the French government to a leftist government in the mid 70s the priori team was just completing a very large installation with permission to treat uh human patients with terminal cancer and Leukemia and so forth now he surreptitiously treated Some Humans before and cured their cancers and leukemias the problem was nobody could understand how it worked we didn&#x27;t even have at the time the knowledge of this new parts of phas conjugate Optics that we needed to understand it it&#x27;s no wonder they couldn&#x27;t understand it nobody could and so when they suppressed that they withdrew the funding from the project it was funded by the French government and when the government changed they withdrew the funding uh every all the work ceased the equipment later was destroyed preor lat later died at any rate this is something absolutely legitimate it did use the type of electromagnetic extension that I&#x27;ve talked about and if we open up that extension there now is the explanation available of how it worked and yes we can cure such diseases if a proper scientific development program can be mounted and funded and it will all be based in part upon the work of Nicola Tesla okay chat I&#x27;m not going to go too much into this you guys know why I work in the healthcare industry you guys have seen covid you guys have seen what they do to people who speak out and speak about alternative uh therapies and things like that nothing I&#x27;m saying here is medical advice at all but if this type of technology is real it goes so far beyond directed energy weapons it also can explain uh warp drive uh manipulation of gravity itself but there&#x27;s also medical healing aspects to it which are very crazy to think about what I&#x27;m feel comfortable talking about is that yes uh multi-drug resistant uh bacteria are a huge thing that are people are afraid of it&#x27;s called super bugs that if we give people antibiotics that what happens is they become they adapt to the antibiotics and become resistant and then they spread and this is what kills people uh especially when you&#x27;re sicker that you&#x27;re much more vulnerable to it I remember talking to various microbiologists that I worked with from the it perspective about it CU I wanted to learn as much as I could about it and that&#x27;s how it kind of works is that you know the sick th ER you are the more vulnerable you are the more uh susceptible you are to these multi-drug resistant um bacteria I in fact remember that on the Shelf they would have some of these super bugs just sitting there in little Petri not Petri dishes but little tubes and you would see the yellow of them of like the tuberculosis and the various other ones that they had that had like they would call the super bugs that they had cultured from people that had died so what he&#x27;s talking about here is the idea and this is from the 80s the 80s this is he&#x27;s talking about it was just getting into the scientific uh and and the mainstream media back then where now even in the 2010s uh from when I was talking about it it was becoming more and more common to understand but that we can solve these problems with scalar physics scary stuff weird stuff to think about again not promoting any other alternative medicines just letting you guys know that there&#x27;s huge applications to this type of science out there it goes well beyond um Espionage and super weapons but also the idea of medical healing often has been a great curiosity about this strange thing the Russians suddenly injected onto the world they had done some pretesting but uh suddenly on July the 4th 1976 for a bicentennial present for us the the Soviets opened up uh some great new transmitters in the communication band which because of the chirping sound and the sound just like a woodpecker&#x27;s Bill hitting a block of wood uh was immediately dubb woodpecker by all the ham radio operators who had it interfering with their Communications and so this was really massive uh communication massive transmitters lots and lots of power and nobody could figure out what in the world was going on uh it made no sense because certainly the signals as seen could do over the rise and radar work which you normally put in that same frequency band but there were also apparently lots of characteristics which didn&#x27;t fit what you would do if you were designing something was just a over the rising radar at all would be no need for such complexity so there&#x27;s been a lot of discussion on it and uh you know I guess the official realization was that or calling it was to say it&#x27;s just simply over the Rison Radars well it built a lot of them but if you look at it through the eyes of the scaler and aerometer and I mentioned the two references and have cited them in various papers there other work on along that line too if that approach is used in what seems to be what Tesla had done if you use the Tesla approach to interpret it now one is dealing with scaler inetryconydot uh astounding potential weapon effects with the intesa uh interpretation one of the things that would result from that line of weapons assuming they are used as scalar infometer weapons uh one of the great things that would emerge from them would be to produce controlled energy at a distance for example um great huge balls of controlled electromagnetic energy or if you pulse it great blasts of electromagnetic energy the diff I mentioned uh the business of biasing the transmitters where you can produce either heat like an explosion or you could produce a cold explosion the sudden explosive withdrawal of uh energy from the local from the distant area uh and in books cited incidents that are representative of what one would find if those incidents actually were occurring on that kind of scale the incidents are there they&#x27;re real they&#x27;re documented they&#x27;re not just Tom beon so there is a good solid set of admittedly circumstantial evidence that the Woodpecker signals because of all the phenomena that can be associated in the same time frame since they turned on these phenomena very strongly suggest that this set of weapons is not just over the rising Radars at all but are really Tesla weapon systems and if they are all the rest follows they have one other frightening area if this thesis is true that is almost mindboggling there is a Soviet physicist scientist named kachev and kachev has produced a series of experiments in two Soviet military institutes before the fall there that uh showed that you could transmit any sort of disease form between cells uh any sort of infectious disease or you can radiate one sample with uh nuclear radiation gamma radiation for example or deadly poison or infect them with viruses it can transmit between um cellular cultures into another cell another sample from the same culture the same disease electromagnetically although the organisms won&#x27;t necessarily be there uh that works in literature if you pursue it kashia has several books out now that are available since the Russian system has loosened up a bit uh that work has been replicated at the University of marberg for example in Germany it has been replicated uh University of Sydney in Australia and it has been replicated by at least one researcher here in the United States he&#x27;s trained to say if there are no force fields there&#x27;s no electromagnetics he ignores the potential that&#x27;s left he just sweeps it away and throws it away from where we&#x27;re coming from with the Tesla approach that is the active part that&#x27;s the part that is being interfered within the bodies or whatever to call cause whatever you wish to cause if we couple it with the kosia stuff we are saying that such scaler transmitters in inetryconydot Ed he was going to visit some nuclear installations and They Carried Geer counters and it was detected on the Giger counter it&#x27;s an ionization device it detects the ionization and discharge of its own gases and anything that ionizes gas it will detect it doesn&#x27;t have to be nuclear radiation and so they thought at first that it was deadly nuclear radiation because all the counters went off and indeed it was not they were irradiating the presid president with this stuff with the Tesla stuff to see if we knew what was going on on uh that&#x27;s a beautiful intelligence probe you pick out a high level Target like the president or you know the embassy you radiate and do some things that are obvious not too bad but are obvious so they can&#x27;t be missed and then you see what happens when the system Goes Bananas trying to figure out what&#x27;s going on and by their actions there&#x27;s no way to fake it you either tell them you know what&#x27;s going on by your action or you show them you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on there&#x27;s no way to get out of it it&#x27;s 100% certain which very few things in intelligence are however if I go back to the Embassy where many Health changes and diseases and so forth you know three ambassadors died of a leukemia like illness eventually these diseases occurred only within the embassy in those areas where the force fields were absent and the potentials were there and the Johns Hopkins researchers did a beautiful job they were expert guys of establishing the force field electromagnetic pattern and since not a single case occurred in that area that&#x27;s by the normal electromagnetics then reached the conclusion that therefore could not possibly be the microwave radiation actually that&#x27;s a false conclusion if the radiation played no part whatsoever and you had that many changes occurred the odds are extremely high that some of those would have occurred in the area where there were force fields and some didn&#x27;t since that did not occur it is a 100% correlation to the Tesla area to the area where the potentials existed and the force fields did not and I&#x27;m sorry they reached exactly the wrong conclusion because the model they applied failed them these were able scientists using only the conventional model and the model actually showed that it was the other stuff but uh LED them to conclude properly for their model that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be the electromagnetics that&#x27;s just one instant so the so chat I don&#x27;t know if you were paying attention to what he just said but holy crap okay if you want to avoid going on the rabbit holes just go ahead and Skip ahead right now because wow so how do you confirm whether or not your opponent your enemy knows that you have this technology simple answer you shoot it at them you shoot it at their leaders you see if they can figure out what you&#x27;re doing to their leaders at a distance you shoot the scaler infer infer interferometry the cross at their leaders and you see if they can figure it out because if they can figure it out then they know the science if they can&#x27;t figure it out then you know that they have no idea what&#x27;s happening because it&#x27;s just going to seem like magic oh they just died of leukemia from nothing and this is the crazy part related to what he just said is that theoretically we can transmit viruses illnesses and diseases electromagnetically through a distance this is scary because I thought the whole 5G stuff was nonsense I thought it was nonsense but now I wonder if there&#x27;s not some tiny element of Truth to that idea that we can actually use this as some kind of biological weapon to spread a virus from one person to another we got people out there wearing masks thinking that a mask is going to protect you a mask is never going to protect you against this kind of thing never in a million years sorry if it hurts anyone&#x27;s feelings out there but that&#x27;s just the truth of it um the fact that this video even exists where he&#x27;s talking about this from the 80s 40 years ago should frighten everybody out there who&#x27;s watching this it frightens me the only way this video can even exist is if there&#x27;s not some element of Truth it doesn&#x27;t mean that everything&#x27;s accurate there&#x27;s not some element of truth to it woodpecker then would apply be able to apply because of so many signals uh the scaler stuff we might not even see with our normal detectors but yet it could do exactly the same thing for example in the United States alone now what does that imply if we are not too far out into left field here if there&#x27;s really a ground as I&#x27;ve tried to describe Here If there really is a theoretical ground here for the use of those weapons in a Tesla mode and the use of the kashf knowledge and experimental results in here apparently confirmed by what happened in the US Embassy then those radiators which are active to this day not in the conventional sense you got to have a different detector those radiators could conceivably create within a mass population almost the instantaneous spread of mass diseases of all kind they would be anomalous you would be dying for example of Bubonic plague and you wouldn&#x27;t have the organism but it represents if that part is true it represents a biological weapon of incredible implications for population Warfare I hope to God I&#x27;m wrong I don&#x27;t think I am one of the questions for anybody who tries to take the Tesla View and tries to do it anywhere halfway scientifically one of the questions that certainly comes out of all this other work on what kind of possible weapons could have been built and what possible uses and demonstrations have been made the question emerges what&#x27;s what about Warfare in the future well what I can do is give you my opinion and uh leave it up to each person to evaluate that as they see fit we have certain Trends however that certainly are possible we see with certainty other nations developing nuclear weapons uh shortly almost everybody that wants to have a nuclear weapon and is a nation of any little size at all is going to have one I would characterize that by the fact that weapons of mass destruction have now passed out of Chess playing hands in other words logical hands into some hands which are irrational and to me that&#x27;s a much more dangerous World there is another thing uh suppose you know the fear all analysts have is the suitcase delivery system you simply slip in the weapon parts and assemble it say in New York City or Chicago someplace and perhaps the next time the US decides to intervene somewhere in the middle east or somewhere the terrorists then blow several of these weapons incredible damage to the United States this would suggest an area where not only have the great Nations been involved in strategic deterrence if I might use that term which is now falling out of fashion but all the small Nations or a lot of them will be able to provide a very positive strategic deterrence to even great Nations by the threat of nuclear warfare clandestine Warfare as I described or biological weapons which are cheap and everybody can have and build it is certainly a much more dangerous weapon that has emerg world that has emerged and the weapon spread now is just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s seeping out just like a torrent there&#x27;s no stopping it and these kinds of weapons one doesn&#x27;t know what will be the future in the slow leakage that seems to be going on in the Tesla weapons certainly it simply adds to the pile at the very best for us the the threat and at the worst it adds an impossible threat so the world is facing facing a set of dangerous possibilities dangerous threats to us all to everybody to every man woman and child um because the civilian population is no longer immune or even Exempted from these kinds of things we&#x27;re facing a world of possibility of multiple Nations multiple kinds of irrational groups being able to apply enormous weapons of enormous implications to even the civilian population our military for example is facing a situation where with a lot of development in biological warfare uh if suddenly new agents that you have no knowledge of whatsoever thrust upon you you have no antidotes you have no uh effective methods of treatment and these are fairly rapidly acting agents let&#x27;s say they kill in two days uh rapid infection I&#x27;m just taking an example You couldn&#x27;t possibly come up with anything to do anything with the normal stuff during that time the only alternative will be the extended electromagnetic treatment because then you could treat it without identifying the agent and cure it before it even came out in illness in your troops otherwise even your military forces face decimation by a sudden unknown agents which they are unable to counter so surprise attack becomes an Ever more dangerous thing in a lot more dangerous hands the world is much more dangerous today for a much more positive application of shall I say Tesla&#x27;s extension to electromagnetics that he was using though not technically describing so well something that&#x27;s much more beneficial or can be to mankind humankind rather than destructive means one should focus on the imminent Advent of practical overunity electromagnetic devices these are devices which can be closed looped to run themselves and produce useful power in the load for One impact which is highly beneficial it&#x27;s obvious the most casual Observer that the use of such systems where the power to run it is actually extracted from the vacuum itself if carefully used there will be no damage to the biosphere and we will certainly eliminate an incredible amount gradually it won&#x27;t happen overnight but we will gradually eliminate an incredible amount of burning of fossil fuels there&#x27;s still a need for all the fossil fuels only not as fuel uh the chemical needs alone for medicine and materials and so forth to benefit mankind are enormous but certainly we will stop all the exhaust and pollutants from from those from the burning of those fuels from entering the atmosphere it just won&#x27;t be happening anymore to the extent it is now on any scale it will allow us to take uh funds for example on something like uh and what I like to think could be a more sane world and a much more protective of the environment of our children and of our children&#x27;s children now in all cander I must add one danger if unrestrictedly used when you produce excess energy of this type from the vacuum right in the vacuum in a local area if you produce a very large amount particularly if you do it very suddenly uh in that region you have a curvature of local SpaceTime and there can be biological effects from that that we are present certainly not quite capable of fully explaining or knowing there&#x27;s going to have to be some careful incorporation of the devices so that we use care we do not inflict any kind of damage on anybody or anything like that so with reasonable scientific care we can prevent any such thing and we should do that we should incorporate such systems into our normal utility Transmissions across the lines the lines are there the maintenance of them is already there the facilities are already there they&#x27;re already connected to the homes it would just be nice if gradually we didn&#x27;t have to burn so many fossil fuels and gradually the power price could come down cheaper and cheaper but meanwhile everybody stays working and everybody stays involved but what we really wish to eliminate is say an older person in New York City cold in the winter very limited income can&#x27;t pay the utility bill very well so it has to keep the power down freezing eating dog food we must do better than that and we can and the Tesla technology will allow us to do better than that so it must be done to understand Tesla you must understand one other remarkable ability that he had that none of his peers had then or now we can only do with great Computing simulation centers from the time he was an early child Tesla had the capability to visual Iz something so intensely and so vividly that he simply couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between that and a real object until he was about 12 years old and he finally found a way to distinguish the difference but this unique ability that he had enabled him to visualize a system in all of its parts working together turn it over and upside down and inside out and watch everything function on any level uh that today we would do with a large CAD cam system or we would do with a very large supercomputer in a very large simulation facility so Tesla also was the F world&#x27;s first great simulating computer center using his own brain none of his cohorts or his colleagues or his peers had any such ability Tesla would build a device a hundred times in his head changing it all the time until he got all the parts working perfectly in his simulation and then he would build it on the bench and most times it would work right away he had already built it 100 times we do exactly that technique today in many fields of endeavor with great effort with great cost big Computing centers Tesla could do it in his head one final question often remains about Nicola Tesla it&#x27;s difficult to put oneself in a situation to believe that he could possibly have done such great things and they have passed completely away into either secrecy or being lost or just simply abandoned so a puzzling question remains how on Earth could this happen suppose it&#x27;s true how could it happen actually it&#x27;s not too difficult ult to understand how but it takes a bit of background and appreciation for the times first of all put yourself in Teslas day when we&#x27;re talking about the installation on Long Island it hasn&#x27;t been very long since custers last stand uh we&#x27;re talking about just prior to marone&#x27;s transmission of signals across the Atlantic we&#x27;re talking about a time when only recently in just the end of the 1880s in the early 1890s has electromagnetics abandoned the Quan Theory and gone to the vector theory of Oliver heavy side largely with some cont contribution by Herz and Gibs there are only at the time prior to the turn of the century possibly about 40 scientists in the world who really understand electromagnetics at the top level there are more than that who are we might say followers but the Shapers there&#x27;s only about no such thing as big government um science there are no large government organizations funding science anywhere a scientist was relatively poor person you know he wasn&#x27;t impoverished but uh he certainly had no income like a businessman there was no place to get grants or to get funding for research all science is patronized somebody has to pay the freight and many of the Avenues we are familiar with today most of them simply did not exist the only way that a scientist or callman inventor such as Tesla could in fact even dream of supporting himself he had to number one discover the thing he had to keep it very very secret and patent it he had to keep it secret until it&#x27;s patent actually was issued some money a scientist at the University who received a $2,000 Grant from an industrial was in in in great shape think of the economics of the time an average person might make $500 a year when we speak of $150,000 an enormous sum of money in that time but we&#x27;re speaking of a time when there&#x27;s still not many checks and balances on the great capitalists uh literally they buy the politicians at will the control of financial power had little opposition in the courts or anything else it was so bad at the time that there was a violent uh labor movement going on against the very same Industrials who kept manipulating the stock market and causing it to change and causing inflation and terribly hurting everybody Anarchy was even a serious threat uh because of the belief that all government was evil prevailing into the laboring class an anarchist even assassinated the president while Lincoln is working on long I mean while Tesla is working on Long Island so one must appreciate the tenor of the times also one must appreciate the communication industry there were very few telephones uh the telegraph which uh wasn&#x27;t widespread but the telegraph existed that was the main route of communication in newspapers uh books to some extent the journals were all pretty well controlled most of them by the scientific Community who&#x27;s already you know very much jealous of Tesla so you don&#x27;t publish in the real scientific journals you have to publish in something like what today would call Scientific American like electrical experiment or something and many of the Publications were letter to the editor so an inventor or a person trying to make a living inide sence as an independent person had a terrible job and a terrible task there was a great secrety clamp on him just because of the situation and tenor of the times this accounted really to a large degree for test secrecy most other inventors who had not yet become highly successful or whatever were also very secret or who still needed large funding so see secret secrets and secreted was the order of the day only when you put it in this background can you understand then how easy it is to suppress it&#x27;s not printed in the newspaper it&#x27;s his single uh exposition of receiving signals from uh outer space caused most of the news media to Simply swing over and go against him the very news media who had simply made him a star so to speak before now couldn&#x27;t get enough to get on him and continue to Hound him and call him every name in the books wow and so from that single remark a great drastic shift in the labeling of Nicola Tesla came about science itself is unforgiving there&#x27;s many histories of scientist persecution of other scientists with whom they disagreed the system is very prone to either destroy condemn or bu any scientist who seriously disagrees with it to this day well documented we could make another documentary movie on just that however here was a preeminent example of a disagreement with the current scientific control and the scientific control was adamant that he get wiped out of the books and he get labeled a lunatic and that&#x27;s exactly what happened he wound up with his name Tesla attached to a coil and one unit of measurement named after his name and as far as a scientist was concerned that was enough he didn&#x27;t deserve anything else most of them so the scientific Community rejected him after Morgan turned his back the financial Community rejected him Jesus uh here was a loner then again absolute loner what was he to do exactly what he did retired to his hotel room and feed the pigeons and think Grand Dreams live on a small pittance which kept life from him together from his native Yugoslavia wow and once a year have a press conference where he spoke of all the grand things that he thought of and he wished to have happened but at least overtly as far as we know overtly never again was Nicola Tesla to ever have a chance to attempt any of the great things that always surged through his Restless mind I guess in summary of all of this what does Tesla represent to the Future particularly benevolently let&#x27;s forget the weapons what can come from Tesla&#x27;s work that&#x27;s been yet unrealized that can benefit humankind everybody on the face of this Earth there are some very positive benefits that Loom the greatest thing that Nicola Tesla ever did was to continue to point out that the present electromagnetics mod model is seriously flawed and that electromagnetics is much more unlimited think for a moment of the service that the limited electromagnetics we have has been put to think of all the electronics the communication industry the Power Systems it&#x27;s changed the life of every person on the face of the Earth consider for just a moment what an extension to what you can do can add to the benefit of everybody everywhere for all time and I think when one Ponders and considers that implication then the full importance and the full implication of Nicola Tesla yet to be realized will indeed be realized wow Thomas Bearden is telling the truth there&#x27;s no doubt he&#x27;s telling truth he&#x27;s not making up stories he&#x27;s telling the truth as he saw it everything that we are doing right now we owe to Nicola Tesla it&#x27;s so hard to absorb all this information because as you guys are probably doing right now you wonder has is everything that I had learned a lie how much is true and I&#x27;m wondering that same thing myself it seems like Nicola Tesla was somebody that understood reality before fake news was even a concept in anyone&#x27;s head and that the media destroyed him because he went against the status quo but does that mean that he was wrong no it doesn&#x27;t Nicola Tesla was right he understood electromagnetics better than anybody else in his time he was so forward thinking that he probably envisioned teleportation of an object before we even thought that something could be possible like that the video that we just watched I think is one of the most important videos ever and I wish I would have been able to meet Thomas Bearden before he passed away he passed away a couple years ago and the sad part is even when I met him before he had passed away I would never have been in a mindset where I could understand what he was saying was true but when I listen to him I clearly hear a person that knows inside information that the rest of the world is simply not ready for not ready to hear not ready to understand and even in the year of 2024 30 some years later I&#x27;m still not sure we&#x27;re ready to understand it this is technology that&#x27;s Paradigm shifting that is hundreds of years potentially Beyond where Current public scientific understanding exists today this is the challenge that that we face is how do we get people to understand that the media is lying to them that the media is not telling the truth it&#x27;s beholden to the status quo Academia that&#x27;s out there that Academia that the textbooks are incorrect and it&#x27;s not a matter of having to rewrite everything it&#x27;s just a matter of rewriting a couple equations and that changes everything that&#x27;s out there I don&#x27;t know the answer all these questions but I thank you guys for being here tonight and I thank you guys for listening and the reality is this technology is real Thomas Bearden is somebody that spoke the truth Nicola Tesla is somebody that spoke the truth and the fact that Elon Musk uses his company name without understanding the implications is is nearly a crime against humanity Elon Musk should at least understand what Nicola Tesla had figured out if you&#x27;re going to use his company name understand the science of what he figured out and be somebody that honors that science using rocket propulsion while you call you have a company called Tesla is a bastard ation of the science that Nicola Tesla supported we don&#x27;t need rocket propulsion we can manipulate gravity itself as Thomas Bearden just mentioned if we create an overunity device using The Ether the The Fifth Dimension of SpaceTime itself that we do not perceive this will bend create curvature in SpaceTime itself just using one of these devices if we power it up to a degree that it can that can do so this proves that the idea of overunity is connected directly to anti-gravity people should take this seriously I have independently figured out that this technology is real based on two videos that I saw on the internet that 10 years ago I would have thought there&#x27;s no way they could be real that now I realize that they are that there is dozens of other people out there that are talking about this type of Technology ology the exact technology and what the implications are of it they are not lying it is easy to cover up absolutely simple to cover up as Thomas Bearden just mentioned is that the same mechanisms used back then are still used today ridicule disinformation anything you have to do to silence somebody in their opinions it&#x27;s simple to do because we as human beings do not understand we want to agree with everybody else that&#x27;s out there instead of going to our own opinions and determining what is real based on our own thoughts and critical thinking this is what I implore upon everybody out there the only thing I want to do here is teach you all to think for yourselves to think critically and I hope tonight that we took one step forward in that process in that level of understanding and that level of En Enlightenment so thank you guys for being here tonight have a great night MH 370x peace</p>
