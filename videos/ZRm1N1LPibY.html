            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>n we&#x27;re very uh grateful for you making the trip from Switzerland to present to us ell in our cars the floor is yours so thank you so I&#x27;m the guy who might you might have heard of that is&#x27;s trying to power cars with alen generators so we&#x27;re based in uh in the is this one no that&#x27;s the trip one so we&#x27;re based in Switzerland in loan it&#x27;s a pretty nice place in and actually it&#x27;s quite cool because the closest toak is about 300 M from where we are and the closest big physics and accelerometers is the C and it&#x27;s about 40 miles away uh we founded the company in March 2012 with very limited funding and uh currently we&#x27;re under due diligence for funding of about 400,000 switch uh we have a very limited budget this year about 60 60k and current staff is 1.5 people the training and but a lot of volunteering partners for different companies that is helping us uh progress on on this job so this is a team so my background is actually not physics it&#x27;s not Nuclear Physics I&#x27;m coming from Robotics and and from U from consumer electronics I&#x27;ve been in charge of a team at Logitech was uh technical leader for uh all the advents research for L group I work for NASA and this way in the past and my partner antoan is actually a nuclear phys physicist and now he&#x27;s working in the uh physics building trying to impr improve the efficiency of uh uh buildings and both of us have cre s startup before and actually we have one person in the team it&#x27;s a small investor but is actually giving us some some advice and he uh challenging us is Daniel B is the founder of Logitech he&#x27;s member of the board of Mesley and uh is one of very wellknown entrepreneur in uh what is our strategy the goal is actually to accelerate the the adoption and and and the reach of alnr electricity production and how to do that is by setting up collaboration with with teams of people that are working in that field with other teams that are doing uh key to electricity conversion and with industrial partners that might be interested in the mobile electric generators and scalable power source so it&#x27;s a long-term scenario as other people said the technology is not mat not ready yet for commercial application so we know that are we too early in the game yes we are but that&#x27;s the way we can enter uh the market so we&#x27;re securing uh some of the application uh by bying Pro patents uh mainly focusing on the transport uh industry uh it&#x27;s still about 25% of the energy consumed every year uh so it&#x27;s a market that no one is currently addressing except and the Strategic plan is the first step was to do networking and uh business uh development and we&#x27;re now in stage two in leverage uh funding then we want to build this demonstrator of an electrical generator uh in self sustain mode based on ALR thermal generator and then it&#x27;s engaging uh key player of the of the industry uh the business model is focusing on the IP and and to stay a technology company so in the short term we want to sell already prototypes then to sell IP license and at the end maybe sell products in partnership with with big industrial Partners um we want to control a portion of the pattern that are combining alen uh um uh generator with uh thermoelectric conversion uh technology so it&#x27;s the company is called alen car but we&#x27;re not focusing just on car so it&#x27;s basically the the our Market is all the transportation industry including uh boats and trains and and electric airplanes in the future uh our assumption is that currently the electric vehicle suffer from uh some problems of the battery first the battery add a large uh cost on the product it&#x27;s add weight we still have reliability issue if you think of the problem of the Boe uh early this year uh you have a fairly limited ran comp to a regular car and you still have risk of fire in case of AIS so with a an IDE of ALR generator we can imagine a lower C product with much higher capacity and uh longer Lifetime and probably safer operation than than batteries uh we have to compare the device we imagine to standard technology like lium ion batteries or hydrogen fuel cell and we can imagine that we have something that is in the same range of weight uh but with much higher energy capacity by consuming much less hydrogen than in the in the F cell um if you compare a regular F cell that is made for for uh for cars we can imagine to have uh 4,000 times more energy for the same consumption of hydrogen uh so so that makes a car that can run about uh 200,000 km so more than 10,000 miles uh between each uh refill so if we can achieve that that&#x27;s very interesting for the the transportation industry so how do we do that well we don&#x27;t want at this stage develop the alar generator ourselves we want to team up with a company that are already Advan with that Curr we&#x27;re speaking with with thean and with there another coporation with r but we&#x27;re happy to collaborate with also in the future uh and we have been sourcing um uh Sterling generators so not stering engine stering generator that directly convert heat into electricity uh these are actually uh affordable device and that are able to be uh delivered and high volume the company we&#x27;re working with we&#x27;re also working on different technology like small ranking turbines and the goal is to combine those two those two technology if you do the mass where at this stage we&#x27;re focusing on a device that would uh consume one kilow of electricity with a cop of about 10 and uh which is what claimed by both Rosy andan and maybe bring you in in the near future so with an output of 10 KW and if you do the mass you can expect something like 1 Point around one 1 kilow or 1.5 Kow this is not enough to power a car but it&#x27;s enough to recharge the battery and that&#x27;s basically what you will consume uh for uh a day uh using the car for 1 hour or 2 hour per L uh so the wrapping all this IDE we have to focus on U on different uh a different strategy to work with the university and we have to find a less controversial way to develop the heat to electricity conversion and actually we find a very good source of thermal energy which is a race car that we&#x27;re working with and it&#x27;s a car that has been uh running in at the 24 hours of lumo uh and was the first hrid car that ever raced in that in that competition it has a a flywheel uh chemical energy recovery system and what we want to use this transform this car into a laboratory a lab car or we want to add a exo seat recovery system and it&#x27;s about the same kind of power uh termal Power that what we want to achieve in in the future uh the other thing we have developed in the last year is building an an ecosystem especially in Switzerland so that&#x27;s our company there&#x27;s another company that has been created called alien invest is actually compan that is trying to raise funds kind of like a VC fund but more more holding that is Raising fund to invest in different companies uh developing alen now it can be jet energy it can be bin can be L uh where I&#x27;m not uh it&#x27;s my partner who is involved in that company and the idea is to to to build uh a system uh of company uh stronger together than just having like Russian valian competiting each other at the end the competition is uh versus the the oil industry and the and the coal industry and nuclear industry and not between the different actor of of ALR then we&#x27;re collaborating also with another company bed in Switzerland called ALR C which is making a a platform a legal platform to build a joint venture between research lab in in the field of alen and and big big industry and we&#x27;re working also with the Swiss uh ecap licenses uh and all those companies have been uh advertising Al s to towards uh cities Mayors towards politicians uh to um companies utility electricity companies to um transportation industry and of course I did not mention it but I&#x27;m one of the founder of mfmp but we&#x27;ll discuss that later with with Bob and and d and we&#x27;re doing collaboration with def calian we have this this deal who is the a Japanese stealing manufacturer who&#x27;s doing the manufacturing in China we&#x27;re focusing with on the transportation industry and we have good contacts with within the automotive field and with other company uh outside the automotive in the transportation industry so some uh achievements so far so we have different alen um uh prototypes that we&#x27;ve developed uh for MMP that are running in in our lad we have applied for one patent in the US that should be established now uh in November this year that is covering basically this idea of of using alen for transportation we have uh collaboration withan collaboration with there another Corporation licenses of partnership with the steerling generator we have done some repetion of uh ch experiment with actually one of the team we where we have positive results with Shani wire and then we replicate this experiment to third party and we have negative results part of there there were some failure in their in their in their system and some failure on our side on on this cell that we developed uh we have the live acquisition system from hug that we&#x27;re using at mfmp to to see live live data from from experiment we get the support from IMD business school in loan uh that is helping us challenging our business model and we have some very good contacts with major uh transportation company so that&#x27;s the current stage of the funding and thank you very much for</p>
