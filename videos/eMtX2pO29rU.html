            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Today I&#x27;m doing a deep dive into the promise software scandal where this journalist Danny Castillo&#x27;s investigation led him to be murdered just getting close to the truth. You know what what is it about this software that would cause someone who is doing an investigation into it to get murdered? Apparently it was uh ruled a suicide, right? However, his family and friends really deny that that this was ever a suicide or at all if he was ever suicidal. So again, what what is it about this software company that would cause that kind of repercussions to someone who&#x27;s just looking into it and doing an investigation about it? &gt;&gt; Stay curious. Investigating software might get you ghostritten.</p>
