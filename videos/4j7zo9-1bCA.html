            <p>(mysterious music) - Top 10 secrets and mysteries. History is full of inventions and discoveries that caused a sensation at the time, only to disappear a few years later, however revolutionary their potential. In every age, there have been inventors whose battles with bureaucracy and the vested interests of giant corporations and</p>
<p>self-seeking politicians were like Sisyphus pushing his boulder repeatedly up the hill, doomed to fail. (beeping) One advantage of living in the age of IT, however, is that now we can save these apparently forgotten or discredited discoveries from vanishing forever.</p>
<p>Suppressed inventions 10, Project Wardenclyffe. Project Wardenclyffe, an experiment as enigmatic as it was controversial, started off as a cooperation between two of the best known celebrities of business and science at the time.</p>
<p>On the science side was the brilliant physicist, Nicola Tesla. On the business side, the powerful banker, JP Morgan. The monumental Wardenclyffe Tower was to be the culmination of Tesla&#x27;s efforts in the field of wireless</p>
<p>energy transmission. JP Morgan invested $150,000 in the construction of the tower, which was designed to transmit signals across the Atlantic. But as we know from Tesla&#x27;s correspondence, that wasn&#x27;t nearly enough and he knew it.</p>
<p>A more realistic sum would&#x27;ve been $1 million. So, why did he accept Morgan&#x27;s offer and start building his tower regardless? As in his previous project in Colorado Springs, Tesla wanted to build a station that would be capable of harnessing large amounts of energy from the air and pump it into the ground.</p>
<p>The mushroom shaped tower was 60 meters tall and the steel dome at the top weighed a staggering 55 tons. A huge shaft, 40 meters deep was dug underneath it where 16 metal cubes</p>
<p>arranged in star-shaped were installed a hundred meters below the top of the tower. A structure of such size and presumed output also needed a new power plant in its vicinity.</p>
<p>And that is where Tesla got a hard, &quot;No,&quot; from Morgan. One of the reasons he withdrew his backing was the success of Marconi&#x27;s wireless radio and as the shrewd Morgan preferred certainty of a risk he invested in Marconi instead.</p>
<p>Tesla looked for other backers but to no avail. Tesla&#x27;s theories were based on the assumption that the earth carries an electrical charge which could be harnessed to</p>
<p>facilitate energy transmission. By setting up a whole network of towers like Wardenclyffe, Tesla hoped to attain his dream of providing free energy for everyone. Of course, the idea of free energy was not terribly appealing to the big energy corporations.</p>
<p>Why should they provide the masses with free energy when they could keep charging them for it as long as they liked? But, who knows? Perhaps Tesla&#x27;s genius and vision will still be appreciated by some future generation. The Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished in 1917.</p>
<p>Over a hundred years later, its original location was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Nine. The suppression of UFO technologies.</p>
<p>One of the most frequently discussed aspects of UFO investigations and alleged contacts with extraterrestrial civilizations is the possibility of using alien technology. If these technologies were really available to humans, there&#x27;s no doubt they</p>
<p>would be much more advanced than the most advanced technology developed by a man. It also goes without saying that any such technology would be highly desirable to any military superpower.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s no secret that any information connected with UFO sightings or with attempts or information about attempts to contact extraterrestrial intelligence is strictly classified. This led some to speculate that some sort of agreement was reached between our political leaders and the alien visitors.</p>
<p>Governments therefore turn a blind eye on the occasional abduction by UFOs, and ignore the testimonies of those who claim to have been abducted in return for which they receive technical specifications that our own species might not discover till hundreds of years from now. There&#x27;s even some evidence for this hypothesis, such as the sightings of military prototype aircraft invisible to conventional radar systems.</p>
<p>In August, 1989, Chris Gibson, a British flight expert, witnessed an overhead flight of two F-111 jets and one refueling plane in the company of an unidentified triangle shaped aircraft, not resembling anything terrestrial. The event took place over</p>
<p>the GSF Galveston key oil rig in the North Sea. In the following years, there were also reports of triangular planes similar to the B-2 Spirit being tested in the famous, Area 51. Some of the prototypes observed seem to be capable of maneuvering in a way not possible the stealth type aircraft. There is evidence of planes</p>
<p>hovering or hanging in the air without moving, then suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds. We can only speculate about information that&#x27;s denied to the general public, be it about military tests, or secret army bases.</p>
<p>The question is whether the strange planes that random witnesses have observed in the sky were created or piloted by man. Eight. Meyer&#x27;s water powered car. In scientific circles, the name Stanley Meyer</p>
<p>arouses secret admiration and open disdain in more or less equal measure. What everyone agrees on, however, is that this man sparked a violent debate in the energy sector between those ticking the</p>
<p>cheapest possible energy, and those in pursuit of the biggest possible profit. What was it that Meyer discovered? Standard chemistry textbooks tell us that water can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by using electricity, but that the process requires more energy than can be retrieved.</p>
<p>Meyer found out however, that when water is influenced by its own molecular frequency, using the system he invented, it can be broken down with only a very small electrical charge. The result is a significant energy gain. - And we have calculated that if we take the dune buggy from Los Angeles to New York, we would roughly use 22 gallons of water.</p>
<p>- Meyer&#x27;s water fuel cell was subjected to tests by an independent patent revision board. The commission of scientists was convinced that Meyers&#x27;s apparatus was capable of breaking down ordinary water into its constituent elements using a minimum of electrical current. Their conclusion after</p>
<p>this first demonstration was that Stanley Allen Meyer had indeed found a way of obtaining energy from water other than hydroelectricity. Understandably, the discovery caused quite a Fiori in the energy industry as the prospect of massive</p>
<p>financial losses loomed. Meyer actually commissioned a prototype car and secured big investors who sensed the enormous potential of his discovery. Before long, however, two of them pulled the</p>
<p>plug on the project, calling it a colossal fraud. This was confirmed in a lawsuit that followed in 1996 during which Meyer, after failing to prove that his invention worked was ordered to return the $25,000 supplied by the investors.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Meyer continued to work on his invention until March the 21st, 1998 when he died suddenly during a meeting with two Belgian investors. The timing of his demise, needless to say, immediately attracted the</p>
<p>attention of conspiracy theorists who claimed that just before he died, Meyer cried out, &quot;They&#x27;ve poisoned me.&quot; The official autopsy, however, showed that Meyer died of a brain aneurysm. All Meyers patents are now in the public domain and can be used by anyone for free.</p>
<p>The fact that no one has yet picked up on his research however, casts some doubt on its practical potential. Does this mean that his invention never worked and never will? Now that the automobile industry is looking in other directions, we&#x27;re unlikely to know the answer anytime soon.</p>
<p>Seven. Legally confidential inventions. Human ingenuity thinks up hundreds of new inventions every year. Some never go into production because they&#x27;re impractical or simply go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Others whose purpose can only be guessed at are deliberately kept secret by governments, and this is done legally through specific laws. The UK and US legal systems, for example, contain clauses permitting</p>
<p>suppression of patents that could threaten national security or economic stability. American confidentiality legislation is covered by the Invention Secrecy Act, which was passed in 1952, at the height of nuclear</p>
<p>bomb testing in the tents atmosphere of the Cold War. This raises the question whether inventions that were meant to serve humanity half a century ago could still represent a real security or economic threat today. From available analysis, it&#x27;s clear that the confidentiality law applied mainly to inventions in the field of armaments manufacture, which could be discovered and stolen by the enemy.</p>
<p>As well as patents relating to the possibility of new energy sources. According to figures released by the Federation of American Scientists in 2017, this law was applied to 5,784 patents. And that&#x27;s only in the United States.</p>
<p>Understandably, the list of the patients themselves is also confidential. However, one such list was disclosed by a court order in the 1980s. It included a laser tracking system, a warhead production method, an anti radar jamming apparatus, and a type of barrier net.</p>
<p>Clearly, it was not thought desirable for any innovations with military applications or relating to more effective energy sources to be widely available. Any inventor whose patent is displaced on the list is obliged by law to</p>
<p>maintain its confidentiality, and forbidden to try to obtain a patent in another country. The patent is primarily offered to government institutions that are likely to have an interest in it. If the inventor fails to</p>
<p>observe the conditions set by the law, he may face large fines and up to two years in prison. Six. Cloudbuster Man. One of the most controversial scientists of his time was undoubtedly the Austrian</p>
<p>psychoanalyst, Wilhelm Reich. This field of research was so-called orgasmic energy or orgone energy, which he believed could cure hither to incurable diseases, as well as control natural processes such as the weather.</p>
<p>Although today his ideas may seem absurd, Reich was no second rate charlatan. His career started in 1919 in Vienna, where he worked with Sigmund Freud. While Freud was undoubtedly an important influence, Reich ended up going his own way. Shortly before the outbreak</p>
<p>of the Second World War, he moved to the United States. There he made his greatest discovery, orgone, a universal and omnipresent life energy. Reich believed in his discovery so strongly that he started constructing</p>
<p>orgone accumulators. Special wooden cabins laced with metal, through which his patients could absorb orgone energy. His faith in the power of orgone led among other things to his conviction that the accumulation of organ radiation in the atmosphere caused widespread drought.</p>
<p>So, he proceeded to build his famous cloudbuster. This device looked a bit like an anti-aircraft cannon, with a system of pipes connecting it to a water source.</p>
<p>Reich claimed it was capable of measuring orgone energy levels and significantly altering local weather conditions. In the 1950s, Reich redirected his attention to UFO sightings. What first got Reich into trouble with the authorities however, were his Marxist political sympathies.</p>
<p>He was placed on the federal watch list of people suspected of anti-American activities. They followed a campaign to discredit him and ban his orgone energy devices. Eventually, the Food and Drug Administration put together a case against Reich had sent him to prison for two years.</p>
<p>And his orgone cabins and publications on orgone energy were destroyed or removed by legal order. On August the 23rd 1956, six tons of books, documents, and publications, some on topics unrelated to orgone from Reich&#x27;s psychoanalysis practice were burned at the Ganseforth public incinerator.</p>
<p>The event is often described as the worst example of censorship in modern American history. Reich himself, meanwhile, did not live to see the end of his prison sentence. A year later, he died of heart failure.</p>
<p>Five. Clark&#x27;s unrecognized discovery. When most people hear the name, Arthur C. Clarke, they immediately think of his contribution to the genre of science fiction, and his novel, &quot;2001, A Space Odyssey&quot;, which he created in parallel</p>
<p>to Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s cult film with the same name. The movie was actually inspired by a Clarke short story, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. But while the screenplay was being written it grew into an entire novel. Clarke was not only a man of literature, however.</p>
<p>This British writer was also an inventor and a visionary. His ideas of a future world were more than mere fantasy. They were the product of a</p>
<p>solid scientific training and a keenly perceptive intelligence. It is well documented that aged barely 15, that Clarke was capable of building his own telescope. During the Second World War, Clarke worked as a radar instructor in the British Royal Air Force.</p>
<p>This gave him access to the most advanced technology in the field and inspired one of his most revolutionary ideas. - [Speaker on radio] Radio transmitter and received-- - At the time, it definitely belonged in the realm of science fiction</p>
<p>rather than science fact. In October, 1945, wireless world published his article on a system consisting of three satellites. It would provide television</p>
<p>signals for the whole world. He correctly predicted the possible use of geostationary orbit and try to get his idea patented. and that was when he hit the stonewall of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To secure a patent in Great Britain in those days, you had to provide two working prototypes of your invention. And this was quite obviously an impossibility, for a civilian like Clarke,</p>
<p>with no government backing. As he said in a New York Times interview years later, the article was written in the last year of the war at a time when it was unclear whether the world was going to see peace ever again.</p>
<p>And I didn&#x27;t think that satellites could be launched until the end of the century, so I didn&#x27;t give the matter of a patent any thought at all. He could then only watch from afar, as one by one, his predictions came true, and in 1962, his satellite idea was put into practice.</p>
<p>In response, he published his famous article, &quot;How I Lost a Billion Dollars in My Spare Time&quot;. Although he was unable to patent his invention, he is known today as the inventor of the telecommunication satellite.</p>
<p>And the geostationary orbit is often referred to as Clarke&#x27;s orbit. Four. Miracle Cancer Cure. Reports of alternative cures for cancer have been around for decades. Potent remedies of natural, chemical, or even spiritual origin</p>
<p>that can end the suffering of millions of people every year. While mainstream medicine struggles to find effective high-tech cancer treatments, is it possible that simpler forms of medication already exist? In the 1920s, American scientist, Royal Raymond Rife invented a machine which generated electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>According to Rife every disease, including cancer has its own electromagnetic frequency or EMF, and can be cured if counteracted with an identical signal. A theory often referred to as radionic.</p>
<p>Although no conclusive evidence has supported Rife&#x27;s claim, conventional medicine has recently begun experimenting with radiofrequency EMFs to treat cancer. This has been found that low frequency EM waves do affect tumors that do not</p>
<p>impact non-cancerous cells. Could Rife&#x27;s ideas have been overlooked by the American Medical Association for almost a century? Barry Lines, an American researcher and author believes they have, and is continuing Rife&#x27;s work, exposing the misconduct fraud and coverups behind his cure for cancer. But why would such a remarkable</p>
<p>alternative treatment be kept secret from the public? Some blame big pharmaceutical companies for suppressing the cure and continuing to regard disease as a necessary source of financial gain rather than something to be fought with every available weapon. Others even go so far to suggest that diseases such as cancer are a tool designed to keep the world&#x27;s population numbers deliberately under control. Could this be the case? And if so, who are the decision makers? The 21st century has already brought us some incredible advances in technology, medicine, and science.</p>
<p>Is it possible that a cure for such a terrifying disease as cancer already exists? And is being kept secret by a well-known pharmaceutical? Three. Project XA. We all know the health risks</p>
<p>associated with smoking. In spite of this, the number of tobacco users continues to rise with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, wouldn&#x27;t it make sense</p>
<p>for a caring tobacco industry to try and create a safer product? Bizarrely, the answer is that they already have. In the 1970s, Dr. James D. Mold, a scientist working for the</p>
<p>Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company was head of a project named XA. After 25 years of research, Mold finally came up with the XA or palladium cigarette which drastically reduced the health risks of smoking and was a far safer product than what was currently available. But just as a product was about to be launched on the market it was abruptly withdrawn</p>
<p>and never reached the drugstore shelves. Why would a safer product be kept from the public? As both himself admitted, they felt that such a cigarette, if put on the market, would seriously indict them for having sold other types of cigarettes.</p>
<p>Eager to hide the real level of toxicity in their products, big tobacco companies went to great lengths to suppress the idea of a safer cigarette. In a later deposition, Mold said that he was forbidden by Liggett to publish his research on the subject. A life&#x27;s work up in smoke.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more shocking are the confidential documents made available to the public in 1998, which show that not only the cigarette manufacturers, but the pharmaceutical industry too, had been involved in blocking Dr.</p>
<p>Mold&#x27;s project in order to safeguard their own financial interests. Whatever happened to Project XA? Will it ever be made public? One day perhaps, when the pursuit of huge profits is no longer the main focus of big corporations, we will at last reap the benefits</p>
<p>of Dr. Mold&#x27;s achievement. Two. Cold Fusion. Our dependence on fossil fuels is irreversibly damaging</p>
<p>the planet&#x27;s ecosystem. Unless drastic action is taken, our very survival will be in jeopardy. Many believe there are clean, sustainable ways of producing energy that have not yet been exploited.</p>
<p>One such technology is called fusion, a form of nuclear reaction that can occur at room temperature. In 1989, American chemists, Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann of the University of Utah, reported that a quantity of anomalous or excess heat was produced in their cold fusion experiments, suggesting that a cheap and abundant form of energy could be obtained through this process.</p>
<p>According to the two scientists, the procedure could be carried out using equipment available to any chemistry student. While these incredible results immediately attracted worldwide media attention, they were greeted with skepticism by the scientific community. So, why should such thrilling news be received with suspicion and disbelief? Possibly because in the past, there have been numerous so-called discoveries free and inexhaustible forms of energy, which in every case were</p>
<p>debunked or remained unproven. Just as in 1951, dictator Juan Peron, announced that a German scientist exiled in Argentina held the secret of nuclear fusion. Or when in 1958, British scientists declared that they were very close to</p>
<p>producing energy from seawater. Not to mention the age old search for a perpetual motion machine. So, why would two renowned world scientists at the height of their careers risk publishing false or unverified results? Both scientists maintained the</p>
<p>integrity of the experiment. But, to avoid further ridicule from the rest of the scientific community, they preferred to keep out of the spotlight. Could it also be that Pons and Fleischmann&#x27;s results were purposely discredited</p>
<p>by a well-orchestrated plan devised by a fossil fuel industry that feared the idea of a new easily available energy source? Certainly, cold fusion, if it could be harnessed would have a huge impact on the oil industry, dramatically diminishing its profits. Pons and Fleischmann&#x27;s conclusions continue to divide scientists to this day.</p>
<p>Some have successfully replicated their experiment. Others have tried, but without convincing results. However, we interpret</p>
<p>this mysterious disparity, the fact remains, that without massive energy resources to supply the needs of human civilization, the global ecosystem as we know it will eventually collapse. Could cold fusion be the silver bullet we are looking for? One.</p>
<p>The secret of the hundredth monkey. Although, it is not strictly speaking an invention in the literal sense, more of a discovery than one that is often viewed with skepticism, we would also like to mention the hundredth monkey in this series.</p>
<p>Some Indigenous Peoples, among them, the Australian Aborigines believe in the existence of a kind of invisible envelope that surrounds and permeates everything on earth. Scientists have been examining this idea for decades.</p>
<p>Though unfortunately, it is as hard to prove scientifically as it is to disprove. The best known aspect of this inquiry is a so-called hundredth monkey phenomenon. The research dates back to 1952, when a team of scientists began observing a colony of monkeys on the</p>
<p>Japanese island of Kashima. In one experiment, the scientists threw some peeled sweet potatoes in the sand. Monkeys love sweet potatoes, but obviously not covered in sand that gets between their teeth.</p>
<p>One of the females in the group named Imo, was the first to start washing the potatoes in water. Soon, all her relatives acquired this skill, and eventually, so did the other monkeys on the island.</p>
<p>After a while, the number of ingenious monkeys reached what is called a critical mass. The South African biologist Lyle Watson, who later analyzed the findings of the Japanese primatologists, rather arbitrarily designated this number as a hundred. After this number was exceeded, all monkeys became capable</p>
<p>of washing the potatoes regardless of whether they were taught the skill or not. Monkeys from other islands also started washing their potatoes. Watson described the 30 year research project focused on the macaque fu scatter monkey in his bestseller, &quot;Lifetime,</p>
<p>A Biology of the Unconscious.&quot; In this book, he reached the conclusion that there has to be some sort of morphogenetic structure or field that envelops the islands, and through which the monkeys are able to communicate. Mainstream scientists express doubts about the quality of this research, calling it unscientific.</p>
<p>And thus, generating even more public interest in the work of their unorthodox colleagues. (mysterious music)</p>
