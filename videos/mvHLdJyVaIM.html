            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>Breaking news. [music] &gt;&gt; This just happened. The United States President Donald Trump has publicly stated on Truth Social that he&#x27;s instructing the government to disclose all information related to UAPs and alien files. Not review, not consider, not partially release, disclose all of it. For [music] decades, UFOs were mocked, buried, dismissed.</p>
<p>Now the sitting president is saying, &quot;Open the files.&quot; And that changes everything. People, [music] this is it. The time has finally come and Zuk makes sense. You get me? Oh.</p>
