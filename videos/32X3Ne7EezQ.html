            <p>so you can either put 20 for the down payment or 3.5 i&#x27;ll go with a 3.5 option with the 3.5 option you&#x27;ll have a higher mortgage payment and you have to pay pmi and that means you&#x27;ll be paying tens of thousand dollars more in interest and fees yep but by doing it this way i&#x27;ll become a millionaire how is that possible the purchase price of the home is 500 thousand dollars at 20 down my mortgage will be 400k and i&#x27;ll be paying 2400 a month yes but at 3.5 your mortgage will be 482 500 your monthly payment will be 2 900 and over the lifetime of the loan you&#x27;ll be paying 559 thousand dollars in interest plus another 200 a month in pmi that&#x27;s almost 100 000 more that you&#x27;ll be paying in interest and fees it is but i&#x27;m gonna invest the difference in the down payment so instead of putting a hundred thousand dollars down i&#x27;m only putting 17 500 and investing the other 82 500 in the stock market historically it&#x27;s returned around 10 per year and compounded over 30 years i&#x27;ll end up with 1.44 million dollars wow that&#x27;s a lot more than the interest in the fees that you&#x27;ll pay on this loan i see why you want the 3.5 option how&#x27;d you learn about this i follow sean he makes your llc&#x27;s</p>
