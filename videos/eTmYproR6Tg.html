man has to say because we can&#x27;t always listen to viewpoints that basically side with us which is in a nutshell confirmation bias so let&#x27;s hear what the man has to say many of you know we&#x27;re out there to explore all this stuff we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s truth and what isn&#x27;t hence the exploration hit that like And subscribe button if you haven&#x27;t already head over to baldbrad.com pick yourself up some merchandise we&#x27;ve got a lot of goodies over there for you without further Ado let&#x27;s go ahead and roll it if you don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going any road will take you there Henry Kissinger one man one Legend you are here in the middle of a domino effect one that started years ago and one that shows that shows no sign of stopping a bombshell story said UFOs are real a whistleblower said the government knows the military has encountered them every day for years there are videos and photos insiders say off-world Vehicles Congress says we need to know more about the UFO a task force created to figure it out are they aliens is there doubt a report&#x27;s release saying maybe it&#x27;s real the information comes with an official seal a UFO office without delusions will look to the skies and find conclusions the government seems ready for the Long Haul and on and on The Dominoes fall I will tell you hey [Laughter] going on be a little poet throw up gang signs like what up homie you unequivocally that there is very compelling evidence that we uh we may not be alone this all seems like it&#x27;s heading towards an ultimate truth no longer ignored a revelation For Better or Worse will further Define the universe but the story was too good to be true the story was wrong and instead of being closer to the truth we probably couldn&#x27;t be further away [Music] basement office for those of you unfamiliar with the current UFO story and the cast of characters within here&#x27;s a quick primer based on information that was originally reported in 2007 at the behest of Senator Harry Reid the Pentagon via the defense intelligence agency created a UFO program called the advanced Aerospace threat identification program or atip the first director of atip was a person whose name wasn&#x27;t reported and who remained unknown the next director of atip was Luis salazando a counter-intelligence official at the Pentagon who by now has become the face of the whole story atip was funded with 22 million dollars the Pentagon awarded the 22 million dollars to Bigelow Aerospace Advanced space studies or bass bass was contracted to perform atip&#x27;s UFO research and investigation bass was founded by millionaire and longtime Harry Reid Financial supporter Robert Bigelow Bigelow&#x27;s been hunting UFOs his whole life within the bass team was Hal put off a former member of the Church of Scientology who claims to be a psychic who can predict the future during the Cold War putoff was involved in the cia&#x27;s project Stargate which attempted to create psychic spies that could use paranormal powers to fight the Russians Stargate was shut down after not achieving this goal the rest of the bass team was largely unknown atip investigated UFOs for five years from 2007 to 2012. in 2012 the Pentagon pulled the program&#x27;s funding and shut it down saying it was determined that there were other higher priority issues that merited funding despite losing funding Luis salazando claimed he kept atip going for years after this staying on as the program&#x27;s director on October 4th 2017 Elizondo resigned from his job at the if he stayed on for that long then who was funding the whole thing I mean 22 million dollars is a lot of money but when you&#x27;re looking at defense budget and kind of where all our money&#x27;s going it is it is not even an eye drop and a five gallon bucket folks so it was it was nothing and like I said time and time again I think Marco Rubio is right to say look if these things are real and they&#x27;re flying over our military installations jamming our radar jamming our Jets our aircraft creating issues for training programs and we need to come to the bottom line of like what the hell is this is it us is it a foreign adversary which we all don&#x27;t think it is or the other side of it is we have crazy people in the highest levels of intelligence that are cuckoo and we need to figure out if they&#x27;re lying or not either way it&#x27;s a huge issue 22 million dollars to kind of figure out what the heck&#x27;s going on is a drop in the bucket to me Lu Elizondo seems like he found a lot of stuff but we&#x27;ll let him continue here Pentagon frustrated that UFOs were not taken seriously by military leaders at the Department of Defense immediately after his resignation Elizondo Hal put off and others took the atep UFO story to former Blink-182 Rockstar Tom Delong and this was not planned this was not planned literally I swear it wasn&#x27;t planned I actually saw Blink 182 in San Diego in concert recently uh yeah okay all right and his to the Stars Academy or ttsa a for-profit science and entertainment company on October 11th ttsa held a press event featuring Tom DeLonge Lu Elizondo Hal put off and other former government officials who claimed to have New Revelations about UFOs the long introduced Elizondo to the world for the first time my name is Lou Elizondo for nearly the last decade I ran a sensitive Aerospace threat identification program focusing on unidentified aerial Technologies it was in this position I learned that the phenomena is indeed real I&#x27;m curious on what you all think about this do you think this guy is part of the psyop program do you think he&#x27;s out there to spread information to kind of leave you wondering or to point you in a direction which is the wrong place he has clearly a lot of information that he&#x27;s not willing to say because he&#x27;s saying it&#x27;s you know classified and stuff like that my question is is that why he why was he not involved in the hearing why was he not involved in the UFO Congressional hearing maybe he was behind closed doors I don&#x27;t know uh but I&#x27;m just curious as to why he&#x27;s not up there now to give you a little bit of more background take it as a grain of salt is what I&#x27;m about to say there seems to be like kind of two big sides to this there&#x27;s the Jeremy Corbell um um Team side of things with George Knapp with Dr Greer as well and then there&#x27;s kind of Lou Elizondo and that whole side of it and they both are going at each other saying things about one another and I&#x27;m just curious on what you think because either they&#x27;re both sides are lying or one side&#x27;s lying and the other one&#x27;s a psyop or one side is lying in a Psy up and all those other things let me know in the comment section it does support the channel folks hit that like subscribe button if you&#x27;re having a lot of fun with us let&#x27;s continue in addition to revealing Elizondo and the Pentagon UFO program The Long also announced that he was going to build an exotic craft with an energy source that can revolutionize the world build his own UFO another presentation by former DOD official Chris Mellon revealed a shocking new UFO case and he displayed a large photo of the UFO at one point the object soars to 80 000 feet harvers then drops its supersonic speeds coming to a Full Stop how did it accomplish these Feats the UFO in the photo was later reported to just be a blurry party balloon the mainstream media reaction I&#x27;ve heard about that uh it&#x27;s not the only time that&#x27;s happened but that&#x27;s pretty funny addition to this event was couched as cheeky celebrity news rather than science or National Defense but that was all about to change on the same day he resigned members of ttsa had introduced Elizondo to UFO author and longtime UFO researcher Leslie Kane She interviewed him and published two stories in The Huffington Post in mid-october which revealed in a media exclusive the existence of the Pentagon UFO program and elizondo&#x27;s role in it however these two stories were still mostly ignored by the mainstream media Leslie Kane then reached out to longtime associate and journalist Ralph Blumenthal Blumenthal pitched the atip and Elizondo story to the New York Times and on December 16 2017 the New York Times and Politico released front page bombshell news stories that revealed the pentagon&#x27;s atip UFO program to the world included in the stories were videos of UFOs filmed by the U.S Navy within hours dozens of other news agencies had the story within days hundreds the first Domino had finally Fallen there is very compelling evidence that we we may not be alone whatever that means [Music] but some people had doubts they noticed that something was off that some things were not adding up one of those people was researcher John Greenwald one of the nation&#x27;s leading authorities on government secrets he runs The Black Vault a website that hosts millions of pages of government documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act when he read the December 2017 UFO stories he immediately noticed some strange discrepancies well right off the bat I noticed that the reporting from Brian Bender of Politico and Leslie Kane Ralph Blumenthal and Helene I think this guy&#x27;s written some books I&#x27;m about to look into that because I would find it fascinating what this guy has to say about a lot of this stuff especially if he&#x27;s like conglomerating or kind of uh building a warehouse of Declassified documents like such as his website that&#x27;d be really cool Cooper at New York Times had a slightly different program name Politico says Advanced Aviation threat identification program New York Times reports Advanced Aerospace threat identification program uh why was there that difference the amount of sources that both news media Outlets had were very very small and likely the same so how is it that the reporting was different as the reporting went on it got worse I mean there were like seven or eight I I lined them all up with dates and who the the media Outlet was and there were like seven different variations of what atip even stood for and to an investigator a researcher like myself and there&#x27;s a lot of other people out there if you&#x27;re looking into something you need to have the name right because if you don&#x27;t have the name aim right how are you going to find anything right right because when you submit a Freedom of Information Act request you have to be specific with the government what you&#x27;re asking for so if you requested for the advanced Aviation threat identification program they could come back and say hey that doesn&#x27;t exist absolutely because the name was wrong yep and you could suddenly be on a goose chase looking for the truth for the real documents correct absolutely the accuracy there was incredibly important the Pentagon officially acknowledging its Advanced Aviation threat identification program Pentagon has confirmed the existence of the advanced Aerospace threat identification program the advanced Aviation Advanced Aerospace Aviation Aerospace Aviation to the advanced aerial threat identification question why couldn&#x27;t you just ask the source in terms of who wrote the piece from Politico or what was it the other one was like New York Post or something like that corner of times whatever it was like what why couldn&#x27;t you just say hey you know what I wanted to follow up here you have the advanced Aviation program or whatever this one has the advanced Aerospace uh identification program like why are these two words different what what were your sources to get these names and I think you could have came down to the bottom line furthermore I mean is it really that big of a deal in my opinion not really because okay you put in aviation you gotta switch to Aerospace I mean you&#x27;re gonna if you&#x27;re somebody that has a house full of two million plus documents you&#x27;ve been down this road probably before of trying to get documents out there so you got to put a different name and you already aggregated all the other possibilities that could have been so you could just throw those in there as well and just try to get everything program so the writing was on the wall that there was something odd just behind the meaning of the acronym another reported detail that is is inconsistent was the years all this supposedly occurred the original New York Times report said the program began in 2007 but further down the same article they report the funding and actual contract creation of the program wasn&#x27;t until late 2008. you start digging in on that and realize that the bid solicitation was never posted for companies to bid on getting the contract wasn&#x27;t posted until 2008. yet we were led to believe that atip started in 2007 created in 2007-2007 2007. so how can you solicit bids a year after the program allegedly started when the reporting said 22 million dollars went to a contractor that started a year before the bid went in wait none of that makes sense it could actually make sense and hopefully I&#x27;m not trying to create a lot of reach here but um it&#x27;s a terrible and really rough analogy but hear me out here is you uh you wrote a script a movie script you have certain characters in mind you have certain people in mind that you would like to play certain roles you would have certain directors that you would like to do or to direct it you have certain executive producers like to be a part of it producers like whole Crews right maybe some uh actual like warehouses and production houses that want to be involved with it as well but you don&#x27;t actually have the funding yet you went out and created an entire script and you have all the puzzle pieces there to create something and you know you just don&#x27;t have the actual funding yet so you go out there with that business plan or that proposal in mind and say look we got all the pieces we just need the funding so theoretically you could have started it in 2007 or whatever and then you got your funding and bids later on after that with all the information that you compiled I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s out of the realm of possibility and hopefully I&#x27;m not talking crazy here but to me it would make sense that it could start in 2007 you had the idea you hear people talk about this all the time of oh I wrote a movie script when I was 15 like super bad for example with Seth Rogen um yeah I had it sit in the drawer for a while so you know I&#x27;ve been working on this for decades even though you weren&#x27;t really working on it for decades but you&#x27;ll you&#x27;ll say that anyways that&#x27;s kind of similar what I believe is happening here adding to the confusion politico&#x27;s reporting released on the same day as the times with reportedly the same sources as the times says atip began in 2009 what now in journalism dates and names are so basic you want to get the basic names right you want to get the basic dates right you can&#x27;t be a year or two off and to this day the reported dates of the UFO program remain all over the place generally in reporting like that if one thing is wrong you have to ask the question what else is wrong further questions and issues arose with Lou elizondo&#x27;s role with atip in hundreds of media reports Elizondo is credited as the Director of atip media Outlets also phrased it as he ran the program or he was in charge of the program and Elizondo without doubt is the face of this whole story now but the Pentagon has released statements stating Mr Elizondo had no responsibilities with atip and this is a statement the Pentagon has doubled down on and they&#x27;re not budging yeah but look when those statements came out I mean you&#x27;re talking almost a decade later and if what um what&#x27;s his face said oh God he worked in S4 why I&#x27;m blank on his name big UFO guy we did a whole thing on him um I&#x27;m totally blanking right now uh Bob Lazar uh look babazar 100 worked in certain areas and I think it was Alamos or whatever it was they said the guy never worked there I mean he has credentials he I think he has like a W-2 form from them for getting paid I mean he has certain things that shows that he works there he actually took George Knapp into the facility and walked them around by the way there were people in there that knew him and knew him of when he worked there but the place says he never worked there so just because the Pentagon says one thing look if you&#x27;re gonna sit there and poke holes at the New York Times and Politico for getting dates wrong which let&#x27;s be honest folks the hunter Biden laptop the Trump the Trump Witch Hunt with russiagate there&#x27;s a lot of things where the the journalism&#x27;s got a stray okay so I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not gonna put all my eggs in one basket with them but with here you know decades later Pentagon doesn&#x27;t like the fact that he came out whistleblowing all this stuff giving them all this information regardless of whether he exposed classified or Declassified information doesn&#x27;t matter this little sus is all and even now over four years later this central part of the whole story continues to be disputed another confusing detail is at the very top of the original Times report is a video of a UFO filmed by the U.S Navy the times reports that atip investigated and released this now famous video to the public yet the video was shot in 2015.</p>
<p>atip shut down in 2012. also the Department of Defense released a statement saying no that video had not been cleared for public release but didn&#x27;t Lu Elizondo say that he stayed on for my 2012 to 2017 or something like that isn&#x27;t that what was stated I&#x27;m not trying to just meaningfully poke holes here but I mean I&#x27;m just trying to connect the dots of what this guy&#x27;s trying to say I&#x27;m in the same boat as him I&#x27;m a skeptic that&#x27;s why we do Supernatural Saturdays yes to get away from the politics and the craziness of everything that is true but I&#x27;m I&#x27;ve always been curious about this since I was a little kid with the experiences that I had with the Supernatural and the Paranormal and all those things um I saw him on the same road as this guy it&#x27;s just I&#x27;m poking holes in the sense of luizano said he was there from 2012 after for a little while balls in the same realm of when this video was supposedly captured or whenever and some in the media wondered how much of this was simply a so-called sweetheart deal between Senator Reid and his longtime friend and financial supporter Robert Bigelow good question in 2017 there were a handful of journalists who pointed this out as a potential red flag public records show Bigelow contributed about twenty thousand dollars to read and his political action committee that campaign contributor got research contracts from this program that just is a bad picture there are other outstanding questions confusing statements and blatant error I just want to go back really quick and I want to look at those statements so if you look at this Bigelow company right 2003 was five thousand dollars and then uh a year later five thousand a year late a year before right O3 so it looked like he was doing about seven eight nine okay well if they said what what is it twenty thousand dollars in total I mean a span of what it looked like a decade uh to me in my opinion just not that much money to I mean is that what it takes ten thousand dollars in a decade to get 22 million dollars of business does that sound right to you guys I don&#x27;t know I feel like I had to give way more money than that um heck folks get out your pocketbook and start supporting Trump or somebody else in politics I guess a thousand dollars a year is going to do it for a decade dollars to read and his political action committee how many did you say I just want to make sure I get this right full of journalists Who Ariel Bigelow whose company receives some of the research contracts was also a regular contributor to reads re-election campaigns campaign Finance records show at least 10 000 from I mean that am I crazy you guys it doesn&#x27;t seem like that much money to sit there and sway somebody like Harry Reid to give you a 22 million dollar contract ten ten thousand dollars you&#x27;re telling me that there&#x27;s nobody else that contributed Harry Reid&#x27;s campaign that was more than that I mean he ain&#x27;t that means he ain&#x27;t much to buy off Let Me Tell You Folks pointed this out as a potential red flag public records show Bigelow contributed about twenty thousand dollars to read and his political action committee that campaign contributor got research contracts from this program that just is a bad picture there are other outstanding questions confusing statements and blatant errors but despite all this the story mostly As originally reported over four years ago mostly without any corrections or updates or disclaimers continues to spread like wildfire and has become legendary so what you&#x27;re telling me is that UFOs are real bill I think we&#x27;re beyond that already I put my entire career on the line because I believe in what I believe he ran the pentagon&#x27;s top secret UFO program I knew this was breaking news for the front page of the New York Times and then bam New York Times story changed that&#x27;s what it was this is too big to turn away from this is real wake up TMC investigates I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m gonna have a job tomorrow just for having this conversation with you UFOs the Pentagon proof Tuesday then in October of 2021 the plot twist [Music] remember that unknown and unnamed individual who is the first director of the atip UFO program well we eventually learned his name James lacatsky and after that we learned his story he&#x27;s finally come out of the Shadows to set the record straight I didn&#x27;t know there was two guys running the show this is news to me I&#x27;ve never heard this guy&#x27;s name I&#x27;m really intrigued now lakatski along with Colm Kelleher a project manager for the Pentagon program and journalist George Knapp released a book titled Skin Walkers at the Pentagon an Insider&#x27;s account of the secret government UFO I think that&#x27;s a fairly new book they say the story we&#x27;ve been told for over four years is wrong book says since the December 2017 article in the New York Times there has been a multi-year frenzy of speculation misinformation and confusion about the nature of the program one of the purposes of this book is to correct the record co-author column Kelleher did an interview saying the New York Times article in December 2017 mistakenly used that acronym a tip and they mistakenly assigned Lou Elizondo to be head of this program and that you know that was a mistake in reporting by the New York Times They say many details in the original story were in error and guess what there&#x27;s actually real documented evidence to back that up and surprisingly some of these documents have been out in the public domain for years now it&#x27;s just that many people including myself didn&#x27;t fully understand what they were or how they relate it if at all to a pentagon UFO program called atip probably because they don&#x27;t mention anything about atip and they don&#x27;t mention UFOs they mention something else so I now present to you the mostly Untold and underreported story of the pentagon&#x27;s allsap program in 2008 at the behest of Senator Harry Reid the Pentagon through the defense intelligence agency created a program not called atip but rather the advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems application program or ASAP we know this because here&#x27;s the actual official Pentagon document outlining ASAP not atip all right let&#x27;s say the documents just really quick here so the acquisition support division of the defense intelligence agency the Ia has a responsibility provide guidance on our side of the Department of Defense acquisition process so producer maintains a projection environment in which the US Air Naval ground in space okay here we go in order to accurately assess the foreign threat to U.S weapon systems a complete as possible understanding of potential breakthrough technology applications employed in future Aerospace weapon systems must be obtained objective is one aspect of the future threat environment involves Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems application the objective of this program is to understand the physics and Engineering of these applications as they applied to a to the foreign threat out to the far term wow through 20 2050 so looking at new technologies basically interesting okay Pentagon document outlining OSAP not a tip the director of alsap was a defense intelligence agency scientist named James lacatzke we know this because here is his name listed on official Pentagon documents as being in charge of the program in many ways all sap started with James lacatsky according to both lakatski and Senator Reid lakatski had approached the senator to say he believed the UFO phenomena was real and he wanted a program to investigate not just UFOs but also how UFOs might fit into the realm of what we might consider the Paranormal Reed told lakatski he would support the creation of a program but according to Reed they faced a challenge how to convince Congress to allocate taxpayer money to investigate UFOs could they create a UFO program without actually mentioning UFOs Reed told New York Magazine I said to lakatski well if you were me what would you say to people in power in the United States Senate who have huge control over the spending of Defense money and here&#x27;s what lakatski said what I will do is prepare something for you that anyone can look at that wants to and it&#x27;s strictly science he put it in scientific language what the study should consist of here are the actual allsap contract objectives there are no mentions of UFOs at all to anyone reading it it might seem like just a normal Aerospace technology contract the actual objective of the program was essentially using currently evolving technology Trends predict what kind of Aerospace Technologies foreign adversaries will have 40 years from now that&#x27;s basically it all sap appeared to be something normal that the government would normally spend money on allsap was funded with 22 million dollars the Pentagon awarded the 22 million dollars to Bigelow Aerospace Advanced space studies or bass bass was contracted to perform all of alsap&#x27;s technical research and Analysis we know this because here is an actual Pentagon document acknowledging bass as the contract recipient bass was founded by millionaire and long-time Harry Reid Financial supporter Robert Bigelow within the bass team was Hal putoff who we already briefly discussed as well as other scientists with a history of unorthodox ideas including Dr Cohn Kelleher and Dr Eric Davis an astrophysicist whose written papers discussing psychic teleportation time travel through Stargate wormholes and bending spoons with your mind bass hired a team of 50 people and then the work on OSAP began on the surface allsap appeared to be an aerospace Technology Program to Harry Reid in his words assap was actually a program to study UFOs and related phenomena with bass however that so-called related phenomena would take all sap in a shocking and very unexpected Direction a lot of asap&#x27;s Investigations took place at Skinwalker Ranch a supposed paranormal hot spot in Utah owned by Robert Bigelow as outlined in great detail on the record by lakatski and bass leadership the so-called Pentagon UFO program was not just a UFO program but rather an investigation into a cornucopia of spooky and scary things including werewolves ghosts and half dinosaur half beaver monsters project manager managed program referred to Skinwalker Ranch as a paranormal Disneyland so the idea was to to have a living laboratory on Skinwalker Ranch that we could assess what was going on unusual creatures discarnate voices Poltergeist activity so it was a paranormal Disneyland that really started the whole thing off [Applause] [Music] allsap spent only one year investigating UFOs ghosts and goblins before the Pentagon started to pull the plug in 2009 after reviewing allsap&#x27;s reports the Pentagon states that it was determined the reports were of limited value in the December 2017 Politico article a congressional staffer is quoted as saying there was really nothing there that we could justify using taxpayer money and that even Harry Reid agreed it was not worth continuing the Pentagon decided not to renew all Sap&#x27;s funding and shut it down completely by 2012. stating that the program was terminated in 2012 due to lack of real progress and concern about the viability of the program and that it was determined that there were other higher priority issues that merited funding [Music] James laketsky I could see that idea now with the reporting of it if you sent that somebody like oh I&#x27;m looking for werewolves and all those other things and ghosts like I I get it um I totally understand that of somebody looking at this going on you know this this 22 million probably could be spent in other places um if you think you&#x27;re looking at strictly UFOs and maybe continuing in the connection to what the original program was stated even though it&#x27;s kind of a falsehood of the guy basically saying look I&#x27;ll create something in which the Pentagon will give us money for we can look at whatever the hell we want but it seemed like the original intention was to look into UFOs and connect that to the propulsion and the Weaponry that could be utilized in Aerospace hence kind of UFOs uaps and stuff but it seems like Bigelow went a little bit too far with it by looking at freaking some insane things and I like Skinwalker Ranch I like the show I find it very fun because that&#x27;s what exploration is all about seems like that book was really interesting of which this gentleman here is picking a lot of his information from uh I don&#x27;t know where he&#x27;s going with this just quite yet says he spent the next few years trying to get new funding to resurrect the dead program and to keep the Paranormal investigations going but he was unsuccessful finally laketsky says he retired in 2016. and that is the mostly untold story about how 22 million dollars in taxpayer money was spent on a wacky paranormal fund house and it appears that at the time the Pentagon had no idea this silly spooky stuff was even happening how is that possible well laketsky the Pentagon director of the program says that for security reasons he was hiding allsap&#x27;s activities from officials at the Pentagon people in my own office they didn&#x27;t know what we were doing they had no idea that I was running Skinwalker Ranch they had no idea whatsoever and was Harry Reid aware of the ghosts and goblins well I guess it depends on which version of his story you want to believe in 2018 in an interview with New York Magazine Reed denied ever being briefed or updated on any of allsap&#x27;s activities ever ever but then in 2021 Reid told George Knapp that Not only was he aware of asap&#x27;s activities at Skinwalker Ranch but that he was potentially planning to go to the ranch himself I remember getting a call from you while you&#x27;re in the well of the Senate and you asked about Skinwalker Ranch whether your staffers should go there whether they&#x27;d be safe did you consider sending some of your people to the ranch and did you ever consider going there yourself I considered it but please don&#x27;t information I got from you and others I decided not to go it would also draw an attention to the ranch and the program right if you went there you&#x27;d have to tell somebody about it that&#x27;s for sure and Senator Reid would eventually fully endorsed this whole crazy story two months before his death by writing the forward to lakatsky&#x27;s book in it he calls out the New York Times the December 2017 New York Times story has done a tremendous amount of good but unfortunately it has also muddied the waters it left the government&#x27;s all set program completely out of the narrative yeah why wasn&#x27;t any of this stuff reported in that bombshell 2017 New York Times article how did a story about a program called ossap which investigated UFOs werewolves ghosts goblins become a story about a program called atip which only investigated UFOs I&#x27;m curious on how he&#x27;s going to address that but it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that Harry Reid would have a wish-washy story and potentially could be telling the truth that he knew nothing about the intricacies of the program itself because in a nutshell you guys if I&#x27;m following along correctly he basically BS the Pentagon in the Department of Defense to give him funding for this program that they weren&#x27;t really looking into Weaponry of Aerospace or Aerospace weaponry and Advanced Technologies in the way of probably what they presented to the government I would imagine it&#x27;s highly illegal and decided to look into paranormal activities on skinwalk or Ranch for about a year and that doesn&#x27;t mean that maybe they didn&#x27;t look into other things I don&#x27;t know uh that were away from Skinwalker Ranch but it makes sense why Harry Reid would say like I don&#x27;t know anything about this look you can know a Skinwalker Ranch was around you can know maybe some big details about the thing without actually knowing the interest you can see but he&#x27;s probably protecting himself if somebody were asking a question like I know nothing about it um you know and he&#x27;s right to say like maybe I shouldn&#x27;t have gone or this gentleman was right to say like hey if you would have gone it probably would have raised eyebrows if you were there which was echoed by George Knapp um on uh the audio there that we just saw so I I think that part&#x27;s nothing Burger in my mind a lot of this I mean maybe the Skinwalker Ranch is the most outlandish thing but I&#x27;m still not seeing his huge like whoa this is a shocking truth of Pentagon ASAP program I&#x27;m not like shocked right now some of the stuff most of the stuff I actually knew already well Leslie Kane is a long time UFO believer and UFO researcher writing UFO stories going back decades she wrote a best-selling book on UFOs in 2010. and it was Leslie Kane who approached Ralph Blumenthal to pitch the big UFO story to the New York Times she was one of the authors of the New York Times article in a recent Showtime documentary Leslie Kane was asked why stories about alleged encounters with alien creatures were not included in her 2017 New York Times article and she replied that her specific goal with that article was to give UFOs credibility so she avoided reporting on some things I chose not to focus on it because the angle that I was taking in my reporting was to try to get credibility for the subject and I knew that that was not the way to go that was not the first step in terms of getting people to accept this so an author of the original New York Times article the article that was the first Domino to fall in all of this says she wrote the article with a specific angle in mind get people to accept UFOs as real that sounds like the goal of an activist not a journalist but I see where she&#x27;s coming from because could you imagine if that first New York Times article had talked about werewolves and poltergeists and giant Dino beavers it would have been laughed at and ridiculed and used as a prime example of the government wasting taxpayer money but because all of that wasn&#x27;t mentioned and only unidentified flying objects were that New York Times article continues to validate UFOs with not just your average citizen but also with members of Congress since the New York Times story came out in December 2017 it&#x27;s politically viable for elected officials to come forward and say I support this kind of research but if you that&#x27;s for researching things in the sky that might be a threat to National Security or to Aviation safety it&#x27;s another matter for a politician to say I agree with spending money to investigate places like Skinwalker Ranch with spooky stories of Boogeyman and and werewolves though the politician is going to fund Poltergeist research or looking into werewolves they&#x27;d be crucified so how much of the well to be honest we&#x27;ve done a lot of weird things as a government they made movies about it like the goat men that were like doing some sort of psychological thing on goats and all those other things we did some crazy stuff okay okay so we put funding in some weird psychological things um uh there&#x27;s like Vision type stuff where you have somebody in a secluded area supposedly being able to look at military installations in the Russia from their home and things like that like don&#x27;t give me this stuff like oh well we wouldn&#x27;t be going and finding weird and abnormal things from Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity we&#x27;ve done it we&#x27;ve already done it so don&#x27;t give me that come on my question is does this say trying to con basically associate the whole idea of well she left out the werewolves the Poltergeist the Paranormal stuff the ghosty wussy activity of Skinwalker Ranch so that she could build legitimacy around UFOs because UFOs itself has an actual legitimacy where we have documented proof of UFOs where we don&#x27;t really have that much documented proof of ghosts and werewolves and Bigfoot and all these other things again the whole show is about all the supernatural things that I just listed I think she was right to kind of pinpoint the UFO idea because that was what the footage was predicated on of which they are bringing about so is he upset the fact that she didn&#x27;t raise awareness to all the weird stuff that they&#x27;re at Skinwalker Ranch I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s necessary but if you want complete exposure sure she should have put it in there but to say oh she&#x27;s an activist I mean come on man it&#x27;s journalism everybody&#x27;s an activist nowadays come on the actual story did the original New York Times article report how much of the actual story is currently influencing Congress the scope of the ASAP program was gigantic compared to the small sliver of information that was reported from the via the New York Times and so the purpose of the book was really to set the record straight I think the book really encapsulates about 97 percent of OSAP whereas the three percent was what the New York Times article had uh had described three percent according to those actually in charge of the actual program the original New York Times article about the program only contains three percent of the actual story 97 percent wasn&#x27;t included so let&#x27;s talk about the three percent that was it was originally reported that the name of the program was atip and it was led by a guy named Lou Elizondo so first where the heck did the name atip come from in his book program director James lacatski writes atip was a made-up substitute name to describe ASAP a made-up name so he&#x27;s saying that atip atip didn&#x27;t even exist that atip itself was a nickname and only a nickname to the OSAP program so they were the exact same thing atip was just a nickname ASAP being the program the program was nicknamed Advanced Aerospace threat identification program atem people have had trouble uh trying to get documents out of the Pentagon by saying they want all documents an atip and they have a hard time because that wasn&#x27;t actually the name of the program the top name there is the actual name of the program but atip was was the nickname that it went by and even Harry Reid and the Pentagon have previously agreed with this Reed stated in an interview that atip and OSAP should be considered together when researcher Roger glasell asked about the names atip and ASAP a pentagon spokeswoman replied that they were the same program and that ASAP was just an alternative name for atip I just I to me it&#x27;s not a big deal in the same way you guys they changed the acronym from UFO to UAP uh they were they&#x27;re talking about the same thing I mean we do this all the time where we create nicknames for other programs I don&#x27;t know I I right as of right now this is a big nothing burger for me so how did atip become a nickname for ASAP well remember how lakatski said he was hiding ASAP from other officials at the Pentagon how according to lakatski they had no idea whatsoever about osap&#x27;s activities in their book the authors say Senator Reid and those working at Skinwalker Ranch were worried that asap&#x27;s activities would eventually come to light yeah that&#x27;s what I just said before because you devised a whole program that was to look at something specific but you were kind of doing something wrong by looking at something totally else yeah you were looking at paranormal and Supernatural stuff including UFOs on Skinwalker Ranch it wasn&#x27;t like that was out of the realm of questioning in terms of what they were researching but again like yeah you would try to hide some form of it again the original idea was how can we get funny to look in the UFO there&#x27;s no way in hell the government&#x27;s just going to give us money for it and you&#x27;re like sure let&#x27;s create a program where they will give you money for it like yes as such Senator wreath submitted a request that all sap be given top secret special access status which if approved would have officially limited how many people had access and control over the program here is the special access request letter submitted by Senator Harry Reid to deputy secretary of defense William Lynn in 2009 but instead of saying ASAP the actual program name read used the nickname atep but Reed&#x27;s plan to protect OSAP apparently backfired his request was denied and his letter was widely distributed within the Pentagon the cat was out of the bag suddenly the rest of the Pentagon which had no idea that this program is underway had no idea suddenly everyone knows about it and they start asking questions gosh what if this gets out that we&#x27;re involved in study of UFOs and ghosts and creatures so two things appear to have happened here one Reed&#x27;s letter was the first time many within the Pentagon had even heard about this program and Reed&#x27;s letter used the nickname atip so according to those who were previously in the dark about all this atip was the name of the program 2.</p>
<p>the Pentagon didn&#x27;t want this embarrassing story spreading outside the Pentagon they didn&#x27;t want it in the press and they didn&#x27;t want speeches in Congress about government waste so they moved to shut it all down the New Yorker quotes a pentagon official saying people worried that if all this came out that the government was spending money on this this will be a bad story the Pentagon pulled all Sap&#x27;s funding in 2010 and by 2012 the funding had completely dried up and ASAP was officially dead but despite the program being shut down Lou Elizondo who had become interested in the UFO aspects of alsap claims he kept the effort going at the Pentagon according to James lacatski Elizondo adopted and appropriated the name atip to describe this new small unfunded and unofficial effort lakatsuki has only done a handful of interviews since going public here&#x27;s a revelatory clip from one of them on the Coast to Coast radio show where he wasn&#x27;t this gentleman&#x27;s whole premise the fact that in a nutshell Louisiana was lying about going forward with atip since ASAP or in other words atip was dissolved around 2012 so how possibly could he continue this whole effort in 2015 to 2017 of which remember 2015 was when the gimbal video of which they showed in here was released so in a nutshell in my idea he&#x27;s trying to make luauzondo to be a liar because like well the program didn&#x27;t exist so how possibly could this all be connected to atip well you just heard another Gentleman Just say that was previously the manager of ASAP going well yeah he continued this whole thing it was unfunded it was kind of an unofficial DOD program but it did continue to do it so doesn&#x27;t it build kind of credibility into Lou elizondo&#x27;s story and narrative the fact that he went on after it was dissolved in a nutshell to continue the whole operation I don&#x27;t know specifically addresses this the atip name was created for a letter that&#x27;s centered to Reed set in trying to establish a DOD sap for our program for various reasons uh and Lou used that name when he and I guess it had to be in the time frame of 2000 [Music] and he used the name atip nothing wrong with that I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s fine but there was a difference between the two programs ours had 22 million dollars in funding is at zero but he did his thing we did ours but I can say that we were the only game in town so what did Lou Elizondo actually do you know the guy who everyone refers to as the Director of atip the Pentagon UFO program Luis Elizondo former director of the pentagon&#x27;s advanced Aerospace threat identification program Luis Elizondo ran the advanced Aviation threat identification program the man who ran that secret program Luis Elizondo thank you for joining us was he even involved in the official Pentagon program at all in the 221-page book about the Pentagon UFO program Elizondo appears one time that&#x27;s a [ __ ] strange right one time at a 2009 dinner sitting at a table with members of all sap and bass where the authors claim he was telling War stories about his psychic powers that&#x27;s it well elizanto himself has stated multiple times on the record that he had nothing to do with ASAP including this emphatic tweet which says it&#x27;s been brought to my attention that despite my constant assertion in the media about my non-involvement in ASAP some are under the false impression that I was part of it for the record again and again I was not part of OSAP Elizondo instead says he was in charge of the pentagon&#x27;s atip program which I think we&#x27;ve established probably didn&#x27;t even exist insiders say it was not an official program it was a completely separate small initiative a small unofficial effort not a program as the p and atip suggests but more in his spare time when his normal day job allowed he looked for UFOs there are two pieces of documentation that further supports this one is an email from the year 2020 released via the Freedom of Information Act to John Greenwald in it Elizondo is challenging the Pentagon press office regarding their statements denying his role with atip Elizondo concedes that his atip could be defined more as simply an activity versus an actual program the second is an annual Pentagon evaluation of Elizondo from the year 2016. it outlines all his officially assigned responsibilities at the Pentagon none of which have to do with UFOs or anything called atip um I would have to look at that more closely just because they don&#x27;t mention UFOs in this uh doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean he wasn&#x27;t looking in UFOs I think this guy&#x27;s making a good point of kind of throwing Lu elizondo&#x27;s whole program into shambles kind of making it seem like it&#x27;s a piece of crap initiative because if ASAP is a tip and they&#x27;re saying look there are basically synonyms of one another they can either be used interchangeably OSAP was given 22 million dollars of funding atip wasn&#x27;t luo Elizondo kind of want to do his own thing we wanted to look into werewolves and paranormal and go see well season maybe every now and then UFOs where Lou Elizondo wanted strictly look at UFOs which is honestly kind of the main function of the program and what it was supposed to be in a nutshell um so maybe Lou Alexander was like you know what hey I&#x27;ll still do this whole program thing but I kind of will look at maybe what the origination of this was and I&#x27;m just gonna go look at the UFO side of it kind of on my own and still in some way shape or form be connected I&#x27;m not trying to be on Lou elizondo&#x27;s side I don&#x27;t know whose side I&#x27;m on man I like Dr Greer I like George Knapp I like Jeremy Corbell I like Lula zondo I like them all they could all be lying for all I know I&#x27;m just trying to build of like what I&#x27;m basically Playing devil&#x27;s advocate here so this guy gentleman&#x27;s Playing devil&#x27;s advocate I&#x27;m on the other side of Devil&#x27;s Advocate as well so with all that in mind let&#x27;s look again at the pentagon&#x27;s official statement regarding Elizondo that appears to be a true statement it does in April 2022 Brian I mean it is technically true right it doesn&#x27;t mean the guy wasn&#x27;t running a tip wasn&#x27;t me he wasn&#x27;t director of atip he kind of create a own side thing and so on side gig himself um so in theory yeah technically they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not lying mind Bender the author of the original 2017 Politico article tweeted that he now feels like he was purposely misled by numerous sources on what atip really was in response to a Twitter user stating seems clear that they wanted to gloss over the Paranormal stuff which is like where all the money really went Bender replied 100 they buried the origin story because they were afraid it would be perceived as an utter waste of taxpayer money it would have also further soured the whole effort given the Bigelow connection to Harry Reid it was a pork project to investigate Voodoo that morphed into UFOs [Music] uh uh yes and no being a pork project kind of just throwing money in there to investigate the voodoo but remember from my understanding ashap was to originally look into UFOs and that&#x27;s why they created the language which we saw was about Aerospace weaponry and propulsion and new technologies in the realm of kind of Aviation and that&#x27;s why even looking down the list it was talking about propulsion and all those other things so I think they&#x27;re I I think that last sentence kind of switches it was more of UFOs morphed into this whole Voodoo stuff it&#x27;s kind of my understanding of it so I think he has a flip-flop and regarding myself and all the basement office episodes I&#x27;ve made about atip and Elizondo I was apparently wrong it wasn&#x27;t intentional but in an honest attempt to report the truth about the Pentagon UFO program I too feel like I was purposely misled as for Elizondo he along with other former members of Tom delong&#x27;s to the Stars Academy have been lobbying Congress to spend more money on UFOs they say the original New York Times article continues to influence Congressional leaders since many of the Paranormal aspects weren&#x27;t included in that story was about UFOs it wasn&#x27;t about werewolves it wasn&#x27;t about the these paranormal uh I don&#x27;t know what you would call them uh anyways the Paranormal research should be done at Skinwalker Ranch store wasn&#x27;t even about skin walker Ranch it was about these unidentified flying objects that are United States Air Force has captured and so that was what it was talking about it was attributed to OSAP and alsap a portion of it was looking at UFOs and so was atip and luolzondo kind of doing his own side thing which was no funding kind of just created an activity himself and was running that side of it so again I&#x27;m kind of missing the huge like the UFO lie I don&#x27;t know where the LIE is at in the realm of UFOs if you want to say they were lying about the ASAP program to be able to look into the Paranormal stuff yeah I mean you are correct but I don&#x27;t know where the the I just don&#x27;t see the the New York Times lie I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t see it Chris maybe I&#x27;m missing it the guy who once stood in front of a gigantic photo of a blurry party balloon admits that telling Congress about allsap would be counterproductive their efforts appear to have paid off bipartisan Congressional leaders like Senators Kristen gillibrand and Marco Rubio helped create a new UFO program at the Pentagon the new program is called the Airborne object identification and management synchronization group and another Domino Falls I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You with one more thing Lou Elizondo said he had nothing to do with allsap nothing to do with the werewolves and ghosts and goblins nothing to do with allsup however in May 2021 Elizondo filed a complaint with the Department of Defense inspector General&#x27;s office written in his own words signed with his signature elizondo&#x27;s complaint accuses Summit the Pentagon of smearing his reputation by releasing statements denying his involvement as director of atip in his complaint which I obtained a copy of he outlines in detail each and every role he claims to have had from 2008 to 2017. in 2008 he says he joined James lacatski on OSAP his role was in his words asap&#x27;s chief of counterintelligence and security from 2008 to 2010 Elizondo describes his various duties with all set including reviewing incoming reports from Bass in April 2010 he writes Dr laketsky approached me and asked if I would consider assuming the role of ASAP an atip director and in May 2010 he says his new role was director for atip and ASAP [Music] I I must be missing something here I think we should stop and ask ourselves how did we get here what stories brought us here who told those stories okay I mean there&#x27;s definitely some theatrics to this uh I am highly curious on what you guys think as well as the commentary that I provided here because I mean I don&#x27;t have any skin in the game I wasn&#x27;t a part of either of those programs I&#x27;m just a third party dude that&#x27;s sitting in his closet trying to explore this world of Supernatural and that&#x27;s why we do these every Saturday uh look there&#x27;s a bunch of lies going back and forth from you know Harry Reid to luolzando to that other guy that was a director um I think there could be a plausible story for both sides to end up being true or maybe it&#x27;s more of a gray area and a new nuanced situation uh I&#x27;m not gonna believe everything the media says like I&#x27;m a conservative a registered Republican folks we do a show Monday through Friday I&#x27;m not gonna believe necessarily what everybody tells me especially our own government that continues to lie to us from the top down but um look it was a program that got funding they lied about it they were looking under the hood on other things uh do I think they should have done that no but they weren&#x27;t gonna get the money in the first place governments looked into more crazier-ish than what they were looking into let me tell you uh I think we do need to look into UFOs look if it ends up being a nothing burger then we know that it&#x27;s a nothing Burger we got nothing to worry about but there&#x27;s a lot of stories about our military personnel coming and encountering these objects every single week every single day I would like to know if it&#x27;s China I would like to know if it&#x27;s Russia because if it is they shouldn&#x27;t be in our space China flew a balloon and other objects over our airspace many of times and we didn&#x27;t do anything about it we waited till it got over the Atlantic Ocean and we shot it out of the sky Cuba has had a Cuba China has had a spy Base in Cuba for I don&#x27;t know like close to a decade is what they say so our military doesn&#x27;t seem to be on top of their ish right now maybe this is a wake-up call what the hell is going on and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re exploring what the hell is going on around us with the Paranormal the ghosty wokies the the spooky Oaky broke into the Paranormal that explained in the Supernatural always curious folks on what you think about all this I love hanging out with you each and every day the supernatural Saturdays honestly are
