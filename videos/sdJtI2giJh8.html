            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>you mentioned for example I&#x27;ve hosted Professor ABI loev and I&#x27;ve hosted Neil degrass Tyson and you mentioned both of them you also mentioned that there could be a possibility that these nonhuman entities um are already here could be already here have the possibility of of being here teasing us with those signals that we could also go there not necessarily you know like you say we&#x27;re maybe not the center attention they&#x27;re doing their own thing out there and so I know that Abby works with you at the soul Foundation um I know that you defer with the ideas of Neil de grass Tyson but if you could have you know if right now talking about God feelings you know because I believe your God feelings are very synced and very you know they have the pulse into all the the statistics and possibility and probabilties so are are these nonhuman entities us in the future or Multiverse like where where right now is your mindset in terms of those things and how how would Abby and Professor the Tyson react on those ideas if I root my answer purely in physics we understand today my answer would be if they&#x27;re here they&#x27;re here because of vanon Newman possibilities right that they evolved elsewhere they set up basically time capsules that they sent around the Galaxy that landed made more copies went elsewhere they landed when they did they you know they&#x27;re either AI that makes something that they can interact with locally you they create avatars of some sort um uh or I mean that that&#x27;s the easiest and safest for me to imagine um the next level imagining is uh you know somebody who&#x27;s figured out how to get at least close to light speed so that they can take advantage of time dilation you know and they can get on and they can get on the bus on one side and get off on the other end you know through either hibernation or something like that they they&#x27;re the same thing when they got there less likely more towards the you know the Fantastical because we can&#x27;t imagine what that technology is yet you know even Ram scoops and other things you know if you&#x27;re traveling a close to light Spade you know a hydrogen atom will rip through your ship at that speed there&#x27;s a great video somewhere of what would happen if a hydrogen atom were traveling at the speed of light and it were to hit Earth it&#x27;s pretty interesting I didn&#x27;t even realize the amount of energy uh that a simple hydrogen moving at that speed could accomplish um so you know if you&#x27;re a ship traveling at light speed you have to worry about those hydrogen atoms um so you know that more moves into the realm of where someone like Neil degrass Tyson would be right that it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s you&#x27;re starting to imagine technologies that we don&#x27;t have yet um you know once you start getting into future humans and you know interdimensional humans or Multiverse humans or Multiverse intelligences I mean that&#x27;s just another level Beyond you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s imagining technologies that we can&#x27;t even imagine how to make so I&#x27;d rather not go there um I&#x27;m perfectly fine if it&#x27;s true but I just don&#x27;t know how to get there and so you know so that in those circumstances I&#x27;d be more likely to credit Neil degrass Tyson with saying well come on you know you know where where I dislike what people like him do is where they diminish the possibility through ridicule because that&#x27;s not science you know I think what that does is it does a disservice to people who come forward with stories because they have a double trauma they have the trauma of having seen something they really don&#x27;t understand and doesn&#x27;t fit with their worldview and then they have the trauma of everybody making fun of them and their family not believing them right um and so that&#x27;s just you know at best it&#x27;s rude it&#x27;s just rude it&#x27;s coarse it&#x27;s inappropriate it&#x27;s wrong it&#x27;s arrogant and conceited so Neil cut this out just stop it it&#x27;s wrong you shouldn&#x27;t do it you wouldn&#x27;t want anybody making fun of your ideas like I do on a regular basis these days but that&#x27;s just quidd proquo right it&#x27;s like you don&#x27;t want somebody doing that to you so don&#x27;t do it to other people especially people who are not as conversant in The Sciences as you are I am AI is both of us are far more accomplished than the likes of him he&#x27;s a TV personality stop believing people like that stop putting them on the TV shows just because they&#x27;re bloviating you know uh nonsense spewers sorry you have to categorize this for people so that they understand that a person like that is not a scientist they&#x27;re just not they&#x27;re a TV personality so you shouldn&#x27;t be going to them so media Representatives who are looking for somebody to speak to that shouldn&#x27;t be the person you go to stop being lazy use your brain find other people who actually can talk about this intelligently and actually have a track</p>
