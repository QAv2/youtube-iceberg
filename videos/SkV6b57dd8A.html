            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] [snorts] What&#x27;s upers? Patrick here with Betted. Today we&#x27;re talking [music] about this psionics is a hypothesis. You know, I I know it&#x27;s kind of in vogue right now uh to to talk about and people claim psionic interactions. [music] I have not seen the kind of scientific study done uh that validates it. Whatever they are are interacting and changing human DNA.</p>
<p>Well, if at some point they wanted to to alter us at that level as &gt;&gt; I mean sure they they [music] could let&#x27;s say but you would have to have a totality of understanding of how DNA operates. The problem of course is [music] what I raised was social contagion um in that you can influence others [music] uh and their stories um just by having heard it previously which is why for instance Jacqu Valet says [music] if you think you&#x27;ve had uh an experience don&#x27;t go undergo hypnosis [music] because you&#x27;re contaminated by you know stuff you&#x27;ve seen on TV and all the hypnosis might do [music] is consolidate an untrue memory. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All right, veters. Please hit that like button. That really helps out the videos.</p>
<p>And of course, if you&#x27;re not already subscribed, hit that subscribe button, y&#x27;all. All right, so what&#x27;s today&#x27;s video about? Well, it&#x27;s about psionics. You see, Dr. Gary Nolan just did this um interview that&#x27;s really not getting a lot of attention to be honest with you and um it&#x27;s really quite an interesting conversation and being that Dr. Gary Nolan has been part of Skywatcher.</p>
<p>Um his comments on psionics were really interesting especially since I have the trailer for my upcoming psionics documentary coming out tomorrow. Um so make sure and check that out. I&#x27;ll put a link down below. Okay. Um, and maybe by the time you see this, it&#x27;s already out, but you know, I&#x27;m on this psyionics run right now, right? I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve went through a whole journey looking into it.</p>
<p>So, hearing Dr. Gary Nolan&#x27;s comments about psionics was really quite interesting and it&#x27;s honestly, it&#x27;s very nuanced. It&#x27;s a very reasonable um response and and I&#x27;ll be honest, it&#x27;s not what I was expecting him to say. Um, and I also have some other clips um because during this conversation, Dr. Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan also said some other things along with a couple of the other hosts that were a part of of this um conversation brought up some good points asked some really good questions and I think they came from viewers too like it was just it was really good. So we have some interesting things to cover [music] but first let&#x27;s start with what Dr. Gary Nolan had to say about psionics. What are your thoughts on psionics who can tether with technology and the conversations they can have? How does this relate to AI data and the control system hypothesis? &gt;&gt; Well, so psionics is a hypothesis. Um, you know, I I know it&#x27;s kind of in vogue right now uh to to talk about and people claim psionic interactions.</p>
<p>Um, I have and my hesitation is because I know people who who claim to have this ability. I have I have not seen the kind of scientific study done uh that validates it. Now I know of people who claim that they can do it on a regular basis and I know the people who claim that go out and and do it. So I it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a hypothesis yet to be at least confirmed at a level that I know I could con I could talk to another one of my colleagues uh you know in in my arena and say hey you should look at this paper that just got published on this. Um so &gt;&gt; okay so this is super interesting.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s just calling it a hypothesis. Again I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s wrong or right. He&#x27;s the smart one, not me. But just considering his connection with Skywatcher, like he knows people who have done that. Yeah.</p>
<p>Skywatcher, right? He&#x27;s been a part of Skywatcher and talked with them and he went out, he&#x27;s been in some of their videos and they are all about psionic assets and that was their whole thing, right? To go out, use psionic assets to uh summon UFOs, then use um a gentleman by the name of James Fowler, use his technology to then sort of, you know, also bring them out. thought it was sort of like a dog whistle. I guess it was a mix and then capture all of this on video. And basically what he&#x27;s saying is he hasn&#x27;t seen anything that you know convince him yet. Dr.</p>
<p>Nolan was there and this was his perspective. &gt;&gt; I personally didn&#x27;t see anything in the sky or on the ground. But what I did see was an individual uh who in the midst of attempting to call such an object exactly at the moment uh that he said he was uh interacting with something. The individual on the roof who had the cameras saw something. When we reviewed what it was that the person on the roof had seen, something showed up.</p>
<p>Uh, I mean it was fleeting, but it was clearly not a bug. And so, uh, what do I have? I have a person who claims to be doing something. Uh, it was clear that he was in distress at the moment of the uh, supposed interaction and at that moment something is seen. What do you have? You have a cor you have a correlation. And really everyone&#x27;s been wondering what Sky Watchers been doing, right? Um because they were allegedly in this sort of data, you know, not capturing cuz that&#x27;s what all the field studies were, but sort of um analyzing all of the data, right? That&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been doing for so long because they&#x27;ve been so quiet, right? So, I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>This was just interesting to hear Dr. Gary Nolled say this to be honest with you. And if I can also be honest, I would love to interview Dr. Gary Nolan um about this uh specifically of course other things um that he&#x27;s discussed. He&#x27;s just a great person to talk to.</p>
<p>I&#x27; I&#x27;ve seen so many interviews with him and I would just love to ask him so many questions, right? He seems very forthcoming and wants to talk about things and I can appreciate that and he&#x27;s, you know, super smart and what he&#x27;s done for cancer research is on another level. if if he just done that with his life, he deserves a a Nobel Peace Prize like an honor, right? I mean, the amount of lives that he saved from his cancer re research is I mean, it&#x27;s just uncomparable, right? So, but his comments here on psionics again just being a hypothesis and it hasn&#x27;t been proven yet. Nothing that he would go to his colleagues with. I again, I&#x27;m not saying I don&#x27;t agree with that. I actually do agree with that.</p>
<p>Um, but I just wasn&#x27;t expecting him to say that just considering his [music] connection with Skywatcher. I mean, listen to what Ross Colar just said about Skywatcher. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ve got Ed. Um, [music] hi Megan Ed down in New Zealand here. Can you please ask Ross if he knows anything about what&#x27;s happening with Skywatcher? Initially, Jake was quite adamant we would be seeing a lot within the first 6 to 12 months, but it seems as though all has gone quiet on that front.</p>
<p>And then moments ago, I was on X and I just had Ian post to me. He&#x27;s saying, &quot;I was following Jake Barber and maybe it&#x27;s me, but I can&#x27;t find him on Twitter now.&quot; And I just also noticed the Skywatcher Twitter page has no posts or updates. Is there anything going on? What What are they up to or any reason behind things going eily silent? And I said I was going to ask you and then Ian responded to me and said, &quot;I found Jake. His last post was a repost in October. Skywatcher page last post was August.</p>
<p>The momentum has stopped and dead. Feels strange. &gt;&gt; It does feel strange and I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. What I&#x27;m told officially that Skywatch has moved beyond the field investigation phase and that they&#x27;re now doing data analysis, which I have to say was surprise to some of the people I was talking to inside Skywatcher. They thought that the field studies were going to be continuing.</p>
<p>Um, it may have something to do with the fact that James Fowler has left working with Skyatcher and he provided a lot of the technical equipment that allowed for the monitoring and videoing of phenomena, including the detection and tracking and obviously the attraction using the so-called dog whistle. Um, I would be speculating. I haven&#x27;t spoken to Jake recently. Um, I will reach out to him. I&#x27;ll ask him what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>Um, I&#x27;m aware of a few things that have been going on about Skywatcher that I can&#x27;t talk about. Um, I wish I could talk more fully. Uh, but basically, um, uh, last time we heard from them, the official explanation was that they were at the data analysis stage. And yes, uh, I think we&#x27;re long overdue for an update. And look, to be fair, Skywatcher still has um till January for their one-year promise they made, right? They said that came out in January, mid January.</p>
<p>So, or near the end of January. So, they still have time to, you know, come back out. And I have a feeling they&#x27;re going to be coming out in the new year. I don&#x27;t know that, but I have a feeling they are. And Skywatcher is mentioned in our documentary.</p>
<p>Uh it&#x27;s not in the trailer at all, but it is in the documentary. We do talk about it because I was trying to get an interview with Jake Barber the whole time and I couldn&#x27;t. He had offered potentially to bring me out to the Skywatcher facility so that I could witness what they did and even participate in some of the field studies. Um but he needed to check with people this that and the other and it just it didn&#x27;t happen. Um and in fact they just stopped doing interviews altogether.</p>
<p>So I felt like it wasn&#x27;t just me. Um [music] it was just they just stopped doing it alto together and all their quote psionic assets are now out on their own doing their own thing. I mean I interview even interviewed Mike Batista uh who was with Skyatcher before. And when I interviewed him he said he couldn&#x27;t talk about Skywatcher because of an NDA he had signed, but he&#x27;s still out there doing his thing and promoting psionics along with some other people. Right.</p>
<p>And I did get to interview him for the documentary. I released a portion of it on the vetted channel. I&#x27;ll put a link down below so you can check that out. &gt;&gt; So, this led you to [music] working with Skywatcher. I know you probably not sure how much you want to talk about that.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I can&#x27;t [music] answer any questions about Skywatcher at all. You know, especially if it it&#x27;s phrased in the question mentioned Skywatcher. [music] I&#x27;m going to have to pass over that one. But it, you know, that career event was a catalyst that led me into working with, you know, military contractors as a psionic asset. &gt;&gt; Why you can&#x27;t talk about Skywatcher? &gt;&gt; Um, I I am I&#x27;m under NDAs with them and [music] um it&#x27;s just I&#x27;m not a this isn&#x27;t a Skywatcher interview.</p>
<p>So, &gt;&gt; you know, and there&#x27;s way more coming in the documentary of that interview cuz I didn&#x27;t share the whole thing. It just it was just interesting. I just found these comments to be quite interesting. But look, Dr. Gary Nolan didn&#x27;t stop there.</p>
<p>Again, this is a very nuanced conversation and I haven&#x27;t made up my mind yet about psionics. If anything, I&#x27;m more interested in it now than I was before I made the documentary. Right. So, let&#x27;s listen to him add on to what he was saying initially. But I&#x27;m going to kind of switch it around and you know because psionics often gets misinterpreted as magic or or woo the the you know the the bad word um the three-letter word uh because it could just be technology you know and that I mean think of it this way our brains and everything that we are oper I&#x27;m interacting with you via quantum waves.</p>
<p>you are just a series of quantum waves that happens to manifest looking like read, you know, and that&#x27;s how my meat brain thinks of you. And and yet we&#x27;re communicating via quantum signatures or quantum forms. Uh now who&#x27;s to say that down at the base level of reality where quarks and everything that we think of as what form atoms etc exist that there&#x27;s not information flowing around that just the right way of twiddling with it from a distance could either be detected or information transferred. I mean we already know it drives the physicists crazy that you can get you know, quantum entanglement, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense, you know? I mean, they use it. We use lots of things that we don&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>And so maybe we just don&#x27;t understand what it is yet. And somebody else has already figured it out. So I think of it as technology. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think of it as magic. &gt;&gt; I But it&#x27;s technology that we don&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t know how yet to reproduce it. Now what I do find interesting is that when people claim they have these capabilities, they seem to follow families or in families. So if it follows in families that that at least suggests genetics &gt;&gt; Mhm. [clears throat] And since the DNA designs your brain and the architecture of your brain, then what that could say is that there&#x27;s an architecture written in the blueprint of the DNA that might make some people more capable than others. &gt;&gt; Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Just a hypothesis. &gt;&gt; So that&#x27;s interesting, right? families. I, you know, um, you know, kind of ran into some of these things myself while I was out there. Um, you know, I&#x27;ve always thought Psionics 2 is just for anybody.</p>
<p>And I still believe that essentially, but that&#x27;s like saying, you know, anybody can play basketball, but not everyone can play at Michael Jordan&#x27;s level, right? Or NBA level, right? So, there could be still something there. Some people are just more keen to it, right? And there are sports families. You ever met one of those in America, right? I&#x27;m from Texas. Like you meet these sports families. Just everyone in the family is just amazing at sports.</p>
<p>They come from a lineage of of sports athletes and all this stuff, right? So it&#x27;s that&#x27;s not a crazy hypothesis. In fact, it&#x27;s very reasonable and grounded in something that&#x27;s already exists that we know of in real life. Right? So I don&#x27;t know just I found this to be quite interesting and it you know that it could be just a technology that we don&#x27;t understand a technology of the brain right and he&#x27;s right that people consider it magic woo especially with sigh in front of it right because [music] in our documentary psionics we explore other things that are sigh related right [music] not just summoning orbs with the mind we do explore some other things now the main focus is the summoning of orbs with the mind but we definitely or UFOs or whatever But we definitely look into other things, people with just mental abilities because look, at the end of the day, we don&#x27;t understand the power of the mind or even what consciousness really is. So, [music] we don&#x27;t know its limits, if it even has any, right? And I find that to be fascinating and I find what Gary Nolan just said very fascinating as well. So, look, let&#x27;s continue because there was even more that Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan said that I found to be rather fascinating. I&#x27;ll and I&#x27;ll slip a tag kind of like a second question in there. Hypothetically, if there were ever a desire to affect human functionality or prefer one more smarter, taller, shorter, or different ethnicity over another, how would that kind of genetic intervention hypothetically take place? How should we look at that? &gt;&gt; You mean intervention? I I Yeah. So there&#x27;s a again there&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of in the in the gestalt of the discussions here that somehow whatever they are are interacting and changing human DNA. Well, if at some point they wanted to to alter us at that level &gt;&gt; as a geneticist, &gt;&gt; I mean, sure they they could, let&#x27;s say, but you would have to have a totality of understanding of how DNA operates that we don&#x27;t currently have.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re gonna splice DNA in and just [laughter] I mean one of the things I&#x27;m known for is having developed the retroviral transfer system that allows you to move giant chunks of DNA you know into into cells and all all human gene therapy uh with retrovirus is done using a technique I you know I developed uh with another with another guy by the name of Warren Perry in David Baltimore&#x27;s lab years ago and that was on top of something that this actually brilliant guy uh Richard Mulligan invented in the first place. I just made his system a little faster, but the original invention is was his. Um, it wouldn&#x27;t be so crude because I mean, and this is the explanation I often use, where&#x27;s where&#x27;s the gene for nest building in birds? There is no gene, &gt;&gt; right? There&#x27;s plenty of places that you could change in the genome that would break the nest build. But that the structure of what makes one kind of nest versus another is encoded at in the DNA and starts way at the beginning of the first cell division when the DNA has a different structure. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not just genes turning on and off.</p>
<p>The DNA literally has a 3D structure. That is the compute. That is the code. And that&#x27;s why I wanted to build that instrument I just showed. Mhm.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; And each time the cell divides, you think of it as a as an unzipping program that&#x27;s unzipping into a new environment of that it expects it expects the new environment and it&#x27;s building the structure of the brain of the of the bird in a way that accomplishes the nest build. So for us to design a bird that makes a different nest, &gt;&gt; we would have to understand all of those unknowable processes at a level of complexity that is a super super intelligence. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So if they&#x27;re if aliens are interfering with humans, they&#x27;re not doing it by some gross DNA splicing. They&#x27;re doing it here and there in a way that would be frankly to me at least almost impossible to trace &gt;&gt; and would be so &gt;&gt; because every change you make is has the has the conse potential consequence of having a downside.</p>
<p>So not only do you have to change the thing that you think is making it better but you have to consider all the negative consequences that might occur in another way. So every advantage in one environment or niche is a disadvantage in another. &gt;&gt; So this is fascinating, right? Just this DNA aspect. And I love what he said about where&#x27;s the genome for the bird nest, right? For birds building nest. Where&#x27;s that? That&#x27;s so fascinating.</p>
<p>See, we just don&#x27;t understand everything. And and his response too to like, well, you know, are aliens like, you know, messing with our DNA? just to put it in layman&#x27;s terms, okay? Just street speak as I like to say cuz some of these terms and people like to sound smart and I&#x27;m not they and they are smart, way smarter than me. But just for me and you listening, right, we just want to hear it how it is, right? Let&#x27;s be real. They&#x27;re talking about aliens splicing into your DNA and making you somehow different or with different capabilities or who knows, maybe tracking system. I I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>But Gary Nolan&#x27;s response, well, you&#x27;d have to understand the totality of how DNA works to really know if that&#x27;s really happening. This, that, the other. And I agree with that. Um, again, you know, that&#x27;s just a very reasonable response. And, you know, that&#x27;s interesting to think about as a theory, a hypothesis.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just we&#x27;re just spitballing here, folks, right? We&#x27;re we&#x27;re just spitballing. [music] Um, but I find that to be fascinating, the DNA aspect of it. Is there something in our DNA that lies dormant that we then wake up? Um, I met people along the psyionics journey that thought that, right? What was interesting is so many different people thought so many different things about psionics and how the mind works and they all had different protocols and approaches and what what it was they were exactly summoning. And that I found that to be fascinating. Everyone thinks about it a different way.</p>
<p>There is no real answer or consensus in the psionics community. Um if they&#x27;re how big that community is, I&#x27;m not sure. Um but this is just fascinating, right? How our DNA works and what exactly is in there, right? Are we just are we predetermined to do the things we do? A beaver builds a dam, a bird builds a nest. Why? Right? Why do they do that? Why don&#x27;t horses build houses, right? Why does my dog build a house or a nest or you know what I mean? like what do we do things like that that just we&#x27;re predetermined to do it no matter what. I just find these things fascinating and is part of that our ability to you know communicate with our minds in a way we just never thought possible or to have powers with our minds we never thought possible.</p>
<p>Right? I mean, tell me you haven&#x27;t tried um, you know, Jedi mind trick before just to move stuff with your mind. Let&#x27;s be real. Come on. You&#x27;ve totally tried that. I know I have.</p>
<p>All right. This is my iPhone case. Okay. I&#x27;m going to try to move it with my mind. Okay.</p>
<p>[music] We&#x27;ve all tried this. The Jedi mind trick. All right. Right. We&#x27;ve all tried this.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see what I can do here. What [music] have I learned? Right. Let&#x27;s see. Nothing&#x27;s working. I can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>HOW DO YOU GET HA? [snorts] You got to just give it, you know, maybe some special word, you know. Kelly Clarkson. I don&#x27;t know. You know, boom. Ba bing.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just making up things now, y&#x27;all. It&#x27;s not I can&#x27;t I don&#x27;t even know what to do. Like what am I doing? You know, why am I [music] why have my hand up? Let&#x27;s just try this. Okay. You know what&#x27;s funny? In my in my mind, I&#x27;m like lifting it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m I&#x27;m seeing it move in my mind. Okay. Apparently I uh just don&#x27;t [music] have it. But let&#x27;s just bombshell. Okay.</p>
<p>Thought maybe that would work. Back to the video. So look, let&#x27;s move on because again, Dr. Gary Nolled said some other fascinating things and this was just a great conversation. I&#x27;m going put a link down below to this full interview.</p>
<p>So please go check it out. How should we regard the complete or near complete lack of such hard proof given such a potentially pervasive and long-standing global presence? Is it is it leave no trace? Is it cover your tracks? Is it the evidence is actually all around us, but we just don&#x27;t have the conceptual net to to capture it or the data collection net? &gt;&gt; Well, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s like with scientists. I mean when another scientist tells me something about what they result in their lab, I don&#x27;t need to go stand over their posttos or their PhD students shoulders to validate it. &gt;&gt; I contextualize it with other things that I know &gt;&gt; and as long as it conforms, I believe. Um, sorry, what was your question again exactly? &gt;&gt; Oh, simply just how should we regard the near complete lack of proof? Is it government secreting it away? Is it NHI? Is it part of the control system avoiding leaving it out for us to find? &gt;&gt; I mean, you depending on the viewpoint, you could say it&#x27;s the the control system continues to lead you on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Into some future. You could claim conspiracy theories. Um uh or that they&#x27;ve gotten darn good at picking up the evidence before anybody else can. um you know or maybe the only you know maybe the only proof maybe proof isn&#x27;t global maybe proof is personal &gt;&gt; you know I mean that&#x27;s really what the point I was getting to about about um scientists is I can I&#x27;ve never seen DNA when I was a postoc I cloned the gene that turns HIV on that was my project and it&#x27;s called NFCappa B P65 Rele um and but I&#x27;ve never seen it but I know what it does and you know I was competing against dozens of other labs luckily we won &gt;&gt; you know and if I hadn&#x27;t done that I would probably wouldn&#x27;t have got my position at Stanford um and so um I don&#x27;t need to see it I just need to see its effect &gt;&gt; to know that it&#x27;s real.</p>
<p>And most biologists have we&#x27;ve never seen a protein, but we know how to tweak the system to make the protein, at least our view of what&#x27;s in the black box, operate, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I But I don&#x27;t need daddy&#x27;s permission to know what I know. And I will continue to operate it personally on the assumption that there is something. &gt;&gt; I just don&#x27;t know what it is. &gt;&gt; I mean, what a great question by that&#x27;s Reed Summers um in there that asked that question to Gary. What a great question.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard that asked before and I have to say that&#x27;s a really really good question and it got me thinking about it. I I don&#x27;t really have an answer for that to be honest with you. Um, but I like what Gary said here, right? Um, you know, maybe proof is personal, right? And look, I also think we need proof for the world and scientific proof. And I&#x27;m sure Gary would agree, but just as a little sidebar, right? There are elements within our life where proof is personal, right? You know, some people will say, well, if you have positive thoughts, you&#x27;ll have a, you know, more positive life. Where&#x27;s the proof of that? I believe that to be true.</p>
<p>Actually, there&#x27;s no proof of it, but it&#x27;s a personal proof, right? And at the end of the day, what else matters? It&#x27;s affecting my life. So, that&#x27;s what I think. I think thinking more positively and optimistically in your real life can help you have a more positive, realistic effect. Now, there have been some studies and this and that, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a proven fact, right? And I can think of many other examples just like that, right? A diet that works for you that doctors may say, &quot;Oh, that doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; Yeah, but we&#x27;re personal. We&#x27;re we&#x27;re all unique individuals on this planet.</p>
<p>So, what works for one person doesn&#x27;t work for everyone else, right? So, the idea of personal proof is interesting and personal disclosure, and I can respect that. If somebody&#x27;s like, &quot;Hey, I believe and that&#x27;s all that matters.&quot; Dude, total respect to be honest with you, right? You don&#x27;t need the world to believe. Um, and I get that. But if we want like studies and funding and this and that, we&#x27;re going to have some sort of uh proof that&#x27;s accepted by the scientific community and the global community. I mean, that&#x27;s just going to have to happen.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, nothing wrong with personal proof, and I really like that. And um, you know, Gary Nolan saying he&#x27;s never seen DNA, right? But we do know it exists, right? Um I don&#x27;t know. I just I just found that to be a fascinating question and a fascinating answer. And I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t don&#x27;t really know what else to say about it. So, please let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure a lot of you are very smart. You let me know every video, you know, that I&#x27;ve got it all wrong and you&#x27;ve got it all figured out. So, let me know down in the comments what you think about that. Now, this next part, some people may not like what Dr. Dr.</p>
<p>Gary Nolan has to say here. That&#x27;s why I saved it for the end. But I found it to be quite reasonable and I have to be honest, I pretty much agree. What is your opinion about people that claim direct exposure to non-human intelligence as evidence itself? &gt;&gt; Um, you know, I I don&#x27;t I certainly don&#x27;t deise dismiss it. Um, you know, because as everybody knows, I publicly stated when I was a young boy, I saw little things in my room that, &gt;&gt; you know, only 20 years later do I was I able to look back and say, well, this is what other people were seeing, &gt;&gt; right? Now, I don&#x27;t see that as proof.</p>
<p>I mean it could be some sort of you know Yungian uh um you know uh unc you know the subconscious uh what&#x27;s the what&#x27;s the term um &gt;&gt; collective unconscious &gt;&gt; thank you the collective unconscious &gt;&gt; um so it could be just a a metaphor that anybody would see um but you know uh I don&#x27;t dismiss it and that&#x27;s why actually I publicly asked for help actually a statistician reached out to me is how many anecdotes make a truth. &gt;&gt; Um and so uh he says and his answer was well we can apply basian prior to it. Uh and the problem of course is what I raised was social contagion um in that you can influence others uh and their stories um just by having heard it previously. Which is why, for instance, Jacqu Valet says if you think you&#x27;ve had uh an experience, don&#x27;t don&#x27;t go undergo hypnosis because you&#x27;re contaminated by stuff, you know, stuff you&#x27;ve seen on TV and all the hypnosis might do is consolidate an untrue memory, &gt;&gt; right? So um you know it&#x27;s what I would ask for if anybody&#x27;s going to interact is one of the things that I raised in the talk itself which is tell me something I shouldn&#x27;t know. Tell me something humans shouldn&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Tell me how to make a machine I shouldn&#x27;t know how to make. You know, that&#x27;s to me evidence of interaction with something. &gt;&gt; You know, Gary, you you mentioned in your talk earlier, &gt;&gt; and I&#x27;ll update, sorry, I&#x27;ll update it just slightly because, you know, I make fun of Neil Grass Tyson all the time, but he&#x27;s he&#x27;s right in this context. He says, you know, bring me an alien ashtray. Well, aliens shouldn&#x27;t be smoking in the first place.</p>
<p>They should know that. But, you know, but but I I think the proof of I mean, the the truth of what he&#x27;s saying is bring me something that they have that we don&#x27;t have &gt;&gt; that I can trace back to non-human. So, from from that viewpoint, he&#x27;s 100% right. &gt;&gt; Tell me something I shouldn&#x27;t know. I love that, right? Tell me something you wouldn&#x27;t know essentially, right? Is what he&#x27;s saying.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you&#x27;ve been if you&#x27;ve had an experience, don&#x27;t get hypnotized. You will be influenced by the time from when you were had the experience and the time from when you&#x27;re hypnotized. You&#x27;re going to be influenced by the things around you. And I know a lot of people aren&#x27;t going to like that because there&#x27;s a lot of stories that come from people being hypnotized. Regression therapy, right? They go into their mind and and come out with new stories and new things and all these details.</p>
<p>And I appreciate Gary saying that to be honest with you because I agree. And that&#x27;s going to anger a lot of people to be honest with you. Right. Um, but you know, first of all, great question. Whoever asked that, right? Great question.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard that asked. Again, this is a fascinating interview that no one has seen. So, link down below, go watch this whole thing because they cover a lot. This is a very intelligent conversation about the phenomenon, the topic that I truly enjoy. Um, I really recommend you listening to the whole thing.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t say that often, you know that. So, I really recommend it. Um, these are just great questions that what a great question, right? Like, is if you&#x27;ve had a personal experience, is that proof? Right? Essentially, like, well, I&#x27;ve had an experience with non-human, so that&#x27;s the evidence. Yeah. But that&#x27;s subjective, right? Anecdotal, right? And people [music] taint it by trying to uncover more information from it from using all these other techniques that aren&#x27;t really proven, i.e.</p>
<p>hypnosis, right? Um, and just going back in this regressive therapy, right? So, yeah, I just found that to be a fascinating question and I know that affects a lot of people because I know a lot of people have had experiences which I can totally understand. I I&#x27;ve met so many people who are so authentic and genuine that they&#x27;ve experienced something they can&#x27;t explain. Right now, they may theorize or this or that about what it is or whatever, but they just flat out say this is what happened. this is what I saw. This is what I heard.</p>
<p>This is what I smelled. This is what I felt. Whatever. This is it. I don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>You know, then some people, you know, start writing books and go to conferences and all of a sudden they&#x27;ve got, you know, 35 new experiences to share from, well, I got hypnotized and now, you know, I&#x27;m talking to the lady. You know, it&#x27;s like, wait, what? There&#x27;s some crazy  out there, right? And we&#x27;ve got to weed through all that, right? It&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got to keep your experience raw and fresh um so that it doesn&#x27;t get tainted, right? We don&#x27;t want any blood in the water. Shout out Dave Matthews Band. But you know, it&#x27;s I just found that to be what a great question and a great answer from Gary. And again, I highly recommend you guys go check out this interview.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to put a link down below. And don&#x27;t forget my um trailer is coming out for Psionics. Please go support it and watching, you know, share it. I&#x27;m going to be talking about it for a while. Um the film doesn&#x27;t come out till next year, but we wanted to get a trailer out early like they like you do.</p>
<p>Okay. Um and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll have some other stuff along the way. I am going to be releasing some more interviews from the documentary that didn&#x27;t get included in the final cut. Now that I&#x27;ve seen it, I know what&#x27;s in it. Um, so I filmed a lot of stuff that just didn&#x27;t make the documentary.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m going to be releasing a lot more of that stuff. Uh, full interviews with people and just extended interviews, right? The a portion after the documentary comes out, if they&#x27;re in the documentary, I&#x27;m going to release the full interview, uh, after that of some of these people. But to be honest, you know, the director did a great job. We included all the best bits. I I really feel this is the best stuff from what we recorded to tell a cohesive story.</p>
<p>There may be great stuff that you shot, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in with the rest of what you&#x27;re trying to show, right? You&#x27;ve got to you&#x27;ve got to tell a story, right? So, anyway, thank y&#x27;all for watching. Uh, hope you guys enjoy the trailer. We&#x27;ll see you guys on the next one. Remember, everyday is a gift, y&#x27;all. Peace.</p>
<p>Patrick, this is Johnny Thomas from the Johnny Thomas podcast. My brother, I just wanted to say I love you. I know how hard the work is. Um I&#x27;ve been really ill actually with [music] um Lyme disease. Um I was in the hospital in April with blood clots in my lungs and been stopping me for a while from doing my show.</p>
<p>I started it out to have fun with my nephew Ron and uh we made a couple of shows but I haven&#x27;t been able to do any because of my health. But I&#x27;m feeling good today and the holidays are close and I&#x27;m interested in all the things that you talk about, especially three Atlas, which if that&#x27;s a comment, I&#x27;ll be shocked. I mean, it&#x27;s amazing what it&#x27;s doing and the things that are going on with it and aviing uh following that quite a bit. But I just wanted to say I&#x27;m really proud of you. You&#x27;re doing a great job.</p>
<p>I really love watching the podcast. It&#x27;s a lot of work. keep on going and hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to make one soon. Um, I&#x27;ve been in and out of the hospital, like I said, quite a bit. Um, the day after my birthday, like November 16th, they took me in an ambulance.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m okay, like I said, and I&#x27;m day to day, but I&#x27;m I&#x27;m tough. So, anyway, much love and keep on going. Take care.</p>
