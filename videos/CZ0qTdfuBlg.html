            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel uh I do educational videos on this channel usually of the uh esoteric and obscure variety and usually theories of everything people who&#x27;ve worked their whole life to put together a you know Grand unified theory of some kind and um got shunned got persecuted never react never got paid never got any Fame uh getting didn&#x27;t get their ideas out there um and I&#x27;m trying to uh revive some of these people who I feel are valuable so today is the 149th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson and Mr Larson was born back in 1898 died in 1990 and uh for about 60 years he was doing uh research and writing on his reciprocal system which is a theory of everything uh that uh he has books on physics astrophysics chemistry astronomy metaphysics economics and uh touches on many other subjects um and they&#x27;re all based on the same Theory so he has one uh Theory which he really puts into two postulates and he drives his entire theoretical Universe from that theory and then um kind of Compares it with the results of the Legacy uh scientist in particular their uh empirical measurements and observations and not so much their theories but their uh you know measurements now we&#x27;re looking at now the basic idea behind Larson&#x27;s theory is that we live in a universe of motion the universe is not made out of matter and it&#x27;s not made out of energy but it is most fundamentally made out of motion matter and energy are merely just two different kinds of motion now other people have arrived at that same conclusion in the past but what distinguishes Larson is that he defined motion as the relationship between space and time now we know that to be true about the most basic uh kind of motion that we see in the real world which is speed speed is space divided by time 10 miles per hour were 50 miles per hour 50 miles of space in one hour of time time divided by space or space divided by time now uh but ever but Larson posits that really every kind of scientific phenomena is a kind of motion therefore it is a relationship between space and time this uh carries with it a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time hence the reciprocal system uh is the name that he used for his system and uh also therefore the uh qualities of time and space are identical they both have three or more Dimensions Larson calls this coordinate space and coordinate time and they both progress in a scalar manner uh time is always getting later and later and later and therefore too so space is always getting farther and farther apart which was observed by the Hubble telescope in the recession of the distant galaxies all of the distant galaxies are getting further and further apart and that is a scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but no Direction so Larson calls that clock time and clock space so there&#x27;s coordinate time and clock time and then also time and space both come in discrete units there&#x27;s no continuity of those uh it&#x27;s a they come in chunks although motion itself is um progressing so and the trunks are very small so this is a very difficult thing to detect but theoretically uh both space and time come in chunks and one unit exactly one unit of space in one unit of time is the speed of light which is very different from what Einstein is saying where Einstein is saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe Larson is really saying that the speed of light is the midpoint of the universe the neutral point one over one now if we go to the area where we have a relation that is one over two then we move into the material sector uh if we go to a relationship that is two over one then we move into what he calls the cosmic sector this is the sector that moves faster than the speed of light which is the kind of the inverse universe of the material Universe which is the universe that moves slower than the speed of light where that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re accustomed to living and measuring but the cosmic universe is more about mental phenomena life phenomena and that is where everything moves faster than the speed light okay uh that&#x27;s just uh you know quick recap maybe not so quick uh but um we&#x27;re looking at his 1979 book right now called Beyond uh called Nothing But motion and this is the first of three books that he has in his series called the structure of the physical Universe second edition this book uh is mainly on physics and a little bit on organic chemistry and we are about to start chapter five which is called gravitation so he&#x27;s going to kind of derive uh what gravity is in his system and I know a lot of people out there may not even believe in gravity at all um that&#x27;s um is not necessarily uh exclusive mutually exclusive with Larson&#x27;s definition he uses the term gravity because that&#x27;s what the Legacy scientists used but he could just instead use the term um density uh or he could use uh the term finding your level you know instead of gravitation so don&#x27;t dismiss just because there&#x27;s one or two discrepancies okay here&#x27;s Larson gravitation another type of motion that is permitted by the postulates and therefore exists in the theoretical universe is rotation before rotational motion can take place however there must exist some physical object that can rotate now sorry to interrupt right away but this these two paragraphs these two sentences are under intense uh scrutiny by the small community that actually follows Dewey Larson&#x27;s work especially uh Dr Bruce perrett took this uh these statements to task and wondered why uh rotational motion can&#x27;t be just as primary as translatory motion and um therefore that you can have rotational motion without a physical object and that really is where another one of the follow uh Larson&#x27;s Associates kvk nehru uh decided that the Photon was a by rotation not a uh not a simple harmonic motion of the simple harmonic motion is a product of it being a by rotation I think that&#x27;s called the Epsilon function from uh or the uh Leonard Euler the mathematician and uh but so just to say we&#x27;re going to let Larson you know try to convince us here but just to say that this idea that right here where he says before rotational motion can take place there must exist some physical object that can rotate that is uh under dispute okay even though and Larson says this is purely a matter of geometry unfortunately you know Larson&#x27;s geometry is also under dispute because in his second postulate he says that the geometry of the universe is euclidean and this in spite of the fact that he I think he know he knew that the geometry of the universe uh was not necessarily euclidean but that was going to be the more the more the kind of the easiest way for people to understand where he&#x27;s coming from he didn&#x27;t want to introduce any of these uh 19th or 20th century geometries into the system uh even though he knew about them and now what peret does is he substitutes in projective geometry for euclidean geometry euclidean geometry is just XYZ coordinates um you know uh but uh projective geometry includes euclidean geometry as a subset so when you use projective geometry instead you still you know have the euclidean geometry at your disposal but it&#x27;s you have a whole lot more as well including a fine geometry and Metric geometry okay now I promise I&#x27;m going to let Larson talk here for a little while we are still in the stage of the development where we are dealing only with scalar motions and a single scalar motion cannot produce the directional characteristics of rotation like the sine curve of the photon they require a combination of motions a compound motion we may say thus while motion is possible without anything moving rotation is not possible unless some physical object is available to be rotated the photon of radiation is such an independent motion or physical object and it is evident from the limitations that apply to the kinds of motion that are possible at this stage of the development that it is the only primary unit that meets the requirement simple rotation is therefore rotation of the photon in our ordinary experience rotation is a vectorial motion and its direction a vectorial direction is relative to a fixed spatial system of reference in the absence of other motion an object rotating vectorially remains stationary in the fixed system however any motion of a photon is a scalar Motion in as much as the mechanism required for the production of vectorial motion is not yet available at this stage of the development a scalar motion has an inherent scalar Direction inward or outward and it is given a vectorial direction by the manner in which the scalar motion appears in the fixed coordinate system as brought out last chapter the net scalar direction of independent motion is inward the significance of the term net in this statement is that a compound motion may include an outward component providing that the magnitude of the inward component of that motion is great enough to give the motion as a whole the inward Direction since the vectorial direction that this inward motion assumes in a fixed reference system is independent of the scalar Direction the motion can take any vectorial direction that is permitted by the geometry of three-dimensional space one such possibility is rotation the special characteristic of rotation that distinguishes it from the simple harmonic motion previously considered is that in rotation the changes in vectorial direction are continuous and uniform so that the motion is always forward rather than oscillating back and forth consequently there is no reason for any change in scalar Direction and the motion continues in the inward Direction irrespective of the vectorial changes scalar rotation thus differs from inherently vectorial rotation in that it involves a translational inward movement as well as the purely rotational movement a rolling motion is a good analogy although the mechanism is different the rolling motion is one motion not a rotation and a translational motion it is the rotation that carries the rolling object forward translationally similarly the scalar rotation is only one motion even though it has a translational effect that is absence in the case of vectorial rotation to illustrate the essential difference between rotation and simple harmonic motion Let Us return to the automobile analogy if the car is on a very narrow road analogous to the one-dimensional path of vibration of the photon and it runs forward in Moving North then when it reverses its vectorial direction and moves South it also reverses its scalar Direction and runs backward but if the car is on a circular track and starts moving forward it continues moving forward regardless of the changes in vectorial direction that are taking place the vectorial direction of the inward translational movement of the rotating system like the vectorial direction of the non-rotating photon is a result of viewing the motion in the correct in the context of an or of an arbitrary reference system rather than an inherent property of the motion itself it is therefore determined entirely by chance however the non-rotating photon remains in the same absolute location permanently unless acted upon by some Outside Agency and the direction determined at the time of emission is therefore also permanent the rotating Photon on the other hand is continually moving from one absolute location to another as it travels back along the line of the progression of the natural reference system and each time it enters a new absolute location the vectorial direction is redetermined by the chance process in as much as all directions are equally probable the motion is distributed uniformly among all of them in the long run a rotating Photon therefore moves inward toward all space-time locations other than the one it happens to occupy momentarily coincidentally it continues to move outward by reason of the progression of the reference system but the net motion of the observable Aggregates of rotating photons in our immediate environment is inward the determination of the vectorial direction corresponding to outward automatically determines the vectorial direction of inward in each case in as much as one is the reverse of the other some of the readers of the first edition found the concept of inward motion rather difficult this was probably due to looking at the situation on the basis of a single reference point outward from such a point is easily visualized whereas inward has no meaning under the circumstances but the non-rotating photon does not merely move outward from the point of omission it moves outward from all locations in the manner of a spot on the surface of an expanding balloon similarly the rotating Photon moves inward toward all locations in the manner of a spot on the surface of a Contracting balloon the outward motion is simply the spatial representation of an increasing scalar magnitude whereas the inward motion is the spatial representation of a decreasing scalar magnitude if that decreasing magnitude reaches zero it continues as an increasing negative magnitude that is if the object which was moving inward toward a certain location eventually arrives at that location it continues in motion beyond that point providing that nothing intervenes okay now I know all this is very abstract and you gotta really uh you know put your visual a visualization skills to work here my recommendation is listen to my video over and over again go over it real slow like one sentence at a time and you know try to visualize what he&#x27;s talking about unpack all the different terms that he uses inward outward uh scalar translational rotational and so on and you might be able to get it but you know the basic idea is that the photon moves outward but a rotating photon moves Inward and that is the basis of gravitation we&#x27;ll uh dig into this more next time thanks for tuning in have a great day</p>
