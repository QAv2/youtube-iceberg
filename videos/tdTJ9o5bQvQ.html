            <p>this is I think close to about 30 years since my last major update in uh anti-gravity research and uh a lot of things have changed in uh 30 years and some things have not changed Dr n n Lee um uh a lady that uh was also trying to work with uh Dr padlock Noob uh she she had some promising results by rotating charged uh semiconductors in a super cool conditions and suddenly early in uh shortly after the year 2000 she uh took some money from the government and basically went on the ground to work on anti-gravity projects and uh she was never heard from again uh at least work-wise</p>
