            <p>that there is other life here and and it&#x27;s in the ocean. And a number of the people in my film go on the record about the UAP activity in our oceans. Even, you know, from senior members of Congress to intelligence officials, they talk about technology that&#x27;s not from here that that&#x27;s otherworldly that has been seen coming in uh out of the ocean and into the ocean. And then in conversations I&#x27;ve had outside of the film, um people have told me about um activity that&#x27;s been tracked by our submarines that&#x27;s just absolutely bonkers. Like massive crafts moving at crazy speeds under the water going past our submarines.</p>
<p>So there&#x27;s a there there&#x27;s a real situation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you if you were an alien and you wanted to hide here on the earth, it&#x27;s &gt;&gt; on our ocean. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You do it under because the ocean is very unexplored like say Yeah.</p>
<p>One of the in my film Admiral Tim Galedet uh says that um we have studied the surface of the moon in more detail than we have the bottoms of our oceans and our oceans are like 75% 75% of our planet is ocean, right? &gt;&gt; Well, that&#x27;s if you believe we went to the moon. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. But I do think I really do think that um going back to the power of movies, you know, I wouldn&#x27;t have made this movie or been interested in this topic had I not, you know, watched Close Encounters countless times and and and had my curiosity peaked. And I think that, you know, my hope is there&#x27;s people out there who start looking into this topic because they watch this documentary or because they watch Steven&#x27;s movie in in June and they start thinking about it differently, taking it seriously.</p>
<p>So, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s go through the movies and what they depicted and see if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s really going to happen. Close Encounters. We want to communicate with the uh aliens and we do it through, as I recall, a synthesizer, &gt;&gt; you know, he&#x27;s playing this tune and then they play the tune back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s like Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, maybe it&#x27;s that. Then there was a movie called I think called Arrival. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It&#x27;s a great movie, too.</p>
<p>That is a great movie. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t remember loving that one either. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s really good. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yeah.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I feel like I feel like your interest in this topic. &gt;&gt; See, I&#x27;m just looking as a you know, &gt;&gt; now that you&#x27;ve watched this doc, you got to do a binge. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. But in that one, I remember there was just a lot of uh the aliens writing in this big curly language on a screen and it was like it didn&#x27;t look like anything we&#x27;ve ever seen, but it was some sort of writing.</p>
<p>sort of contact event, some sort of communication. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, how do you think it&#x27;ll happen? What how will we I mean, shouldn&#x27;t they know with all their advanced knowledge? Can&#x27;t they just have a English to alien thing in their phone that &gt;&gt; I mean, you know, some of some of the people in my film talk about how there have been contact events. Um, some of the intelligence officials in my film talk about uh learning of an event that happened um where UAP landed on a on a military base and non-human beings interacted with CIA and Air Force officials. &gt;&gt; When you see mean when you mean say interacted, you mean dating? [laughter] &gt;&gt; No, but what do you mean by interacting? You meant they had a said they interacted.</p>
<p>They communicated somehow. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s what you Uh, &gt;&gt; well, what&#x27;s the official? &gt;&gt; They must if they&#x27;re if they&#x27;re testifying about this, what&#x27;s the somehow? &gt;&gt; That was that was all that was said. And they and the intelligence official in the film talks about a conversation he had with um President Bush one senior about this and um yeah, it&#x27;s a fascinating part of the film. Halaman Air Force Base is the name. &gt;&gt; I loved it that Bush too his comment was I ain&#x27;t telling.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#x27;s one of that&#x27;s &gt;&gt; I mean that says a lot. That was one of the &gt;&gt; I ain&#x27;t telling &gt;&gt; but that was one of the coolest. &gt;&gt; But Texas if they try to mess with Texas &gt;&gt; that but &gt;&gt; where the point of the spear &gt;&gt; what he talks about in that section of the film I think is fascinating. Uh a bunch of the people I interviewed revealed that during Bush 2&#x27;s administration shortly after 9/11 he was contemplating going public with the base facts that he had learned that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe. And they held a they held a multi-day I think it was two or three day think tank where they invited a couple dozen people to come and evaluate what the pros and cons would be and they basically ranked they were tasked with debating and then and then applying a number to the impact.</p>
<p>So on a scale of 1 to 10, like 10 being a bad impact, too much impact, one being minimal impact to every like vertical of society like religion, the economy, all these different areas they came up with and a number of the people that were um part of the think tank, they went into it excited about it and hopeful that it would bring about disclosure and then they all came out on the other side deciding it would be a bad idea that the time wasn&#x27;t right for it. This was like right after 9/11. One of the people in that think tank is in my film. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that would &gt;&gt; Dr. Hal Pudof is a senior scientist for my film worked on a lot of classified UAP programs.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, that wasn&#x27;t Bush one. &gt;&gt; No, that was two. That was &gt;&gt; Bush two. Okay. Right.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. One was the one who talked about the hell landing. &gt;&gt; So, this think tank was when Bush two was &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then they decided not to do it and uh not to go public with it. &gt;&gt; Well, that was prudent to use the father&#x27;s term.</p>
<p>I mean, not after 911, you know, like it&#x27;s let&#x27;s [snorts] deal with the jihadists before we deal with the aliens. It&#x27;s also come out recently um that Cheney was very involved in covering this up. No longer around, obviously. [laughter] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Something nefarious that the the aliens killed him because he knew too much? &gt;&gt; No. No.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m saying he maybe it&#x27;ll lead to change that he&#x27;s no longer around. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t think it was them. He had a heart that plugged into the wall. Okay. This this guy was not well when he died.</p>
<p>But uh &gt;&gt; No, I didn&#x27;t mean like that. I mean, he was involved in the decision to to not have it go public. &gt;&gt; My guess is he would have had Hallebertton digging on the planet X-ray [laughter] before they ever signed a deal, but not to speak ill of the dead, but um so &gt;&gt; what do you think will happen now? You&#x27;ve seen you&#x27;ve seen this documentary, you&#x27;ve see how the truth is starting to come out. What do you think will happen? &gt;&gt; Well, again, I I I think the Spielberg movie is go I mean, it&#x27;s Steven Spielberg. I think this will be sort of the um ultimate moment in his amazing career.</p>
<p>Uh because uh as we were starting to say, movies do move people. People are a mass. They they are the masses. They&#x27;re called the masses for a reason. They&#x27;re not called the bunch of intellectuals.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; They&#x27;re the masses. I love them. I&#x27;m not putting them down, but I&#x27;m just saying &gt;&gt; masses need to be moved by mass entertainment &gt;&gt; and and that has, you know, Hollywood, which I criticize a lot and they deserve it a lot, but Hollywood uh show business in general, uh, is responsible for societal change probably more than any other part of society. I&#x27;m talking about &gt;&gt; could agree with you more, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; and he&#x27;s the greatest filmmaker of all time. &gt;&gt; He is absolutely.</p>
<p>I always say about him, he&#x27;s known as the greatest filmmaker and he&#x27;s still underrated. &gt;&gt; Uh but like if you go back to Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement in 1947, which is about anti-semitism, which is back in style, but back then they were against it and they made movies like that. Uh racial issues, who&#x27;s coming, guess who&#x27;s coming to dinner in 1967. gay issues, uh, AIDS, disabilities, nuclear energy, China syndrome. I mean, when Hollywood addresses an issue, it does change minds.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s mostly been for the better. It&#x27;s mostly been, you know, liberal people saying, you know what, let&#x27;s move up on this. Now, you know, we&#x27;ve we entered a woke era where I think we went a few subway stops past where we should have gotten off on some things, but basically Hollywood has been a force for good in opening people&#x27;s eyes to a lot of social issues that they need have their eyes open to. And now I think it&#x27;s, you know, if we can like step up and do our part, it will be this issue. will be technology which really is the social issue of the</p>
