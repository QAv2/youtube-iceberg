            <p>In a previous video, we built the Liberty Engine 5.0, a self- sustaining generator capable of producing more energy than it consumes. Many criticized it for violating the laws of thermodynamics, but our prototypes operate at a quantum level thanks to the composition of their rotor. For decades, the scientific community has accepted as dogma that any closed electromechanical system must dissipate energy limited by Lens&#x27;s law and omic losses. But what if that limit isn&#x27;t a [music] universal law, but rather a consequence of the conventional materials we use? In the quantum realm, especially in materials that exhibit macroscopic [music] coherence, such as superconductors, the rules change. That is, the laws of thermodynamics as we are accustomed to them, don&#x27;t apply.</p>
<p>Nicola Tesla claimed in 1901 that [music] his world system drew energy from the ether. He died in poverty. His papers confiscated by the OSS.</p>
