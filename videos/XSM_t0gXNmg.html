            <p>all right hello everyone welcome to my channel uh this channel is for educational purposes uh and um today is video number 226 on the reciprocal system of theory this is a theory of everything that was first derived by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century and uh he before he died he put out books on physics and astrophysics and chemistry and astronomy and metaphysics and religion and um not full books on those latter topics but uh at least chapters multiple chapters and books uh also psychology economics um and some of his uh followers have put out many other books on many other subjects uh we are looking today for the second day on um at uh the Daniel papers uh his first paper uh called the geochronology first paper on his in his anthropology series and uh Daniel uh is a pseudonym for uh Dr Bruce perrett who recently passed but he put out several articles uh under the name Daniel Phoenix 3 which apparently was his alter ego or another identity that he had working for a Black Ops project uh either the Montauk project or the Philadelphia Experiment he was a young computer programmer uh in those uh out at Montauk uh Point their uh Long Island and uh you know you can check out books from uh Duncan Cameron or albelic or um there&#x27;s another one too uh who&#x27;ve all um talked about the Philadelphia Experiment and the Montauk project but peret uh was a student of Dewey B Larson uh did a lot of great work uh kind of uh revising a few of the minor points uh somewhat major points of Larson&#x27;s work and also uh stepping out into new areas and so we&#x27;re entering into some anthropology here uh just to give you a quick update on the reciprocal system uh the basic idea and the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe of motion and uh not a universe of matter not a universe of energy but a universe of motion and for Larson uh motion was the relationship between space and time space and time had um basically three qualities that uh showed their reciprocal relationship they have the same qualities but they&#x27;re uh uh numerator or denominator of a fraction um so you can think of it as like three and one-third three is the reciprocal of one-third uh they both have the same quality three but one is the numerator and one is the denominator uh in one case and three is the numerator and three is the denominator in the other case uh and uh motion itself is a fraction with time or space as the numerator and space or time as the denominator the three qualities that they have are their coordinateness so coordinate space XYZ coordinates but there are also uh there&#x27;s also coordinate time three dimensions of time uh and then there is clock time uh the clock is always getting later and later and later this is a scalar motion Larson calls it a uh the progression or scalar motion um and then there&#x27;s also clock space space is always getting farther and farther and farther apart um and then they both also have uh come in only discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time they don&#x27;t come continuously they come in chunks and exactly one chunk of space in one chunk of time is the speed of light speed is space over time so one uh one chunk of speed one chunk of space per one chunk of time the speed of light the speed of light then is set up as the midpoint of the universe not the maximum uh that is what Einstein said but that&#x27;s because Einstein didn&#x27;t know about uh half of the universe uh which Larson calls the cosmic sector the half of the universe that&#x27;s actually moving faster than the speed of light that sets up a whole another uh set of new findings that we can make a lot of that is gone into in Larson&#x27;s book beyond space and time but he also covers that in some of his other books on um Atomic physics we just went over that book called Nothing But motion uh where he talks about the cosmic sector and cosmic ray Decay Cosmic atom building and so on uh the universe the cosmic universe is exactly the same as the material Universe except that the roles of space and time are reversed okay we&#x27;re gonna try to get into the next section here uh just to uh you know remember the first couple sections of this uh just went over uh in particular how um time is uh Larson Larson detected uh through his uh understanding of radioactivity and prep piggybacking on on that he&#x27;s saying that all of the dating is uh profoundly um off by met orders of magnitude and that uh where they have uh say that they um uranium has a half-life of 4.5 billion light a billion years Perez saying that it&#x27;s really you know in the thousands at or a million at the most or you know uh off by at least a factor of a thousand um probably more um and uh so he&#x27;s scaling down the uh the time uh the time distance and then what he&#x27;s going to try to do is he&#x27;s going to try to um pair up the ages uh geological ages with uh some of the major events that took place in some of the Holy books so where you know you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;re saying that the eocene age or whatever uh or paleocene age or whatever that uh the dinosaurs lived in um actually didn&#x27;t occur 65 million years ago but actually occurred like 65 000 years ago or even less so uh that&#x27;s what he goes through in the first couple sections this next section is called calendars our calendar is based on rotation the rotation of the Earth around its axis days the moon around the earth moons or months and the Earth around the Sun years historically different societies record their calendars in different ways some count days to calculate years others observe Celestial alignments to determine when a year starts and significant events planting and harvest but don&#x27;t really care about individual days these different systems are all translated to our modern Convention of days months and years our current 365 day calendar represents the way rotations and orbits occur now but was this always the case in order to be that static rotation or orbit could not have changed over the Millennia the mass of the sun earth and moon would have to remain constant despite all of the meteor meteoric dusts they accumulate every day and the internal structures would also have to remain constant indicating that nothing much is going on inside the cores not a very logical conclusion given this observations but um sorry no but given the observation it takes it makes far more sense that the lengths of the day month and year have probably changed throughout our history if the length of the year was different millions of years in the past who cares but if it happened only a few thousand years ago when mankind was alive and well populating the Earth he just might have recorded those events in his Legends and that could make a significant difference to our account of History particularly in correlating dates from different cultures delving into historical and mythological records one finds that this is the case Everything Changes the length of the day month and year and observations of these events are usually associated with global cataclysms these worldwide geologic events indicate that something has shifted and a new Epoch complete with different lengths of days months years and climatic change has begun but there is something you should first understand about modern accounts of ancient civilizations and here he&#x27;s uh getting into a quote um my grandfather once told me a story about archaeologists out digging in the remains of an ancient city that was the home to a pagan people some of the people still lived in a nearby town and they had some local helpers to clear away the dust and debris of the centuries at the entrance to many of these homes they found a blessing bowl a small bowl that the residents used to sanctify themselves as they entered their homes very similar to the Catholic practice of Dipping dipping one&#x27;s fingers into a bowl of holy water and making the sign of the cross before entering a church this was a major Discovery since it told much of the religion of these ancient people after a few weeks they began to run low on food so they accompanied one of the locals to a nearby town to resupply while walking through the street of the mark to the marketplace they noticed those same little blessing bowls by the entrances to the homes out of curiosity one of the archaeologists asked their guide if they still practiced that Pagan religion of centuries ago the guide looked puzzled at first looked at the bowl and replied no but the dog still gets thirsty with that in mind Let&#x27;s ignore what the experts on the Mayan civilization have told us about the calendar and consider the words of an ex of an elderly uh kiche Mayan I met on a bus on the way to Chichen Itza when he offered to explain the calendar Stone I had on my shirt I have long since forgotten his name so we will just call him Bob Bob told me that at the start of the human world there was but a single calendar and count what we know these days as the Sulkin and Long Count there were 20 days in a month and 13 months making the 13th the last month 13 was considered an N number used to indicate the end of Cycles When A Man was created there were only 20 260 days in a year when Man was created there were only 260 days in in a year and the moon orbited the Earth in 20 days not 28. when I asked about the hob Bob told me that it did not come into existence until the end of the fourth baxton after another great cataclysm that moved the land and water about fire rained down from the sky and no one knew where anything was anymore The Sky Had so darkened that the sun was not viable for 20 years sorry the sun was not visible for 20 years after that the gods gave them a new calendar the hob having 18 months of 20 days to match the heavens out of respect for a howl they kept the Sulkin along with the Hub and the Dual calendar system was born important to note is that there were only 260 days in a year at this time uh for the five uh 360 days in a year at this time for the five day month of ym was not added until hurricane became angry and added the wyab uh the five evil days at the end of the sixth bathtub fortunately the Maya used the Long Count to count days so we know exactly how many days have passed since the creation of the human world and we can adjust the number of years using Bob&#x27;s calendar information shorter years early on mean more of them so the calculated start of the Mayan Long Count was not 3113 BC but a bit farther back some 56 5773 years ago 3761 BC anyone familiar with the Christian Bible or the Hebrew calendar May recognize that year the Year Adam and Eve were created a perfect match to the Mayan start of the human world now that we have a very close correlation between the Mayan and Hebrew calendars from opposite sides of the planet other information becomes available Hebrew accounts say the great flood occurred 1656 years after Adam converting that to a Long Count with the corrected calendar puts us near a 2.19.16 .0.0 which is about six years short of the end of the third bacton the date of the Mayan flood the adjusted date for the Hebrew Exodus from Egypt is about 1550 BC with is plagues volcanoes earthquakes and the darkening of the Sun the end of the fourth bactin was 1548 BCE almost a 6 000 year period of history and the stories of the Deluge and exodus Max match up with their Mayan equivalence to within six years I&#x27;m sure that must be a coincidence we&#x27;ve decided we&#x27;ve declared we&#x27;ve decoded the blessing bowl at the doorstep so on to the plates in the kitchen okay so that&#x27;s the end of that section so the next section is going to be about plate tectonics um now this is a little bit difficult to read here just because um he has a lot of footnotes and uh it kind of breaks up everything to go into detail with his footnotes um so I think I&#x27;m gonna kind of just go back and read his footnotes at the end of each section uh he says I&#x27;ve run into some estimates based out of recomputation of the beginning of the cenozoic Epic the dinosaur extinction and that 65 million year value came out to be only about 75 000 years curiously matching the start of the third density discussed in the law of one material uh yeah so Bruce was also uh tangentially involved in this law of one material from the raw material jumano um and uh Bruce was a a pretty uh tight with Carla Rucker um and uh incidentally Don Elkins uh the uh questioner and the raw material was a a big follower of Dewey B Larson&#x27;s uh until he died as a result of that raw material uh uh tobacco back in the early 1980s um Bruce was also um the Informer for um David Wilcock and all of the books that David Wilcock wrote he dabbles in the reciprocal system but he never got to the point where he really understood what he was talking about um and so um Bruce was really the person that was trying to I think Bruce and David were living together as roommates and um Bruce was trying to get David to kind of grasp the reciprocal system but I don&#x27;t believe he ever did so uh if somebody has any other Intel on that please let me know but uh so Bruce was uh mixing it up here quite a bit uh between these Daniel papers and the Montauk project and the David Wilcock and the law of one um he&#x27;s making the rounds um and that&#x27;s a good thing uh because he&#x27;s at least trying to kind of spread out this reciprocal system and make uh sense of it in light of a whole lot of other findings okay he also says I did not include the week as a natural rotational period of of a Celestial something because what it was measuring is no longer there uh so he um he will explain what the week used to be later on in this paper um and uh let&#x27;s see the yeah the sacred calendar is called the soaking in the Mayan and uh then um he refers to the god a how in the Mayan who&#x27;s the equivalent of Anew the Sumerian god and uh according to him and then um that&#x27;s about it okay so the next section which I think we will start up tomorrow is called growing a planet with expansion tectonics yeah all right uh thanks for tuning in uh moving a little bit slow through this uh but uh there&#x27;s a lot here uh but you know he&#x27;s got it set up that there&#x27;s I mean we&#x27;re already four pages into the article and we&#x27;re already at 25 footnotes or something so um I and the footnotes are are usually pretty meaty so we get into some stuff with the footnote so I don&#x27;t want to leave them all behind but I don&#x27;t want to uh you know be disjointed by like every time he&#x27;s got a footnote going you know leaving the text and going into something else so trying to figure out the best way to do it you have any suggestions let me know otherwise thank you for tuning in I hope you come back tomorrow and uh you know get into this fascinating story um and I&#x27;ll talk a little bit more about the dating as as it goes on too uh all right have a great day see you later</p>
