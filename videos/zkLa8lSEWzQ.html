            <p>you know till mysteries fans would like see package with another video so you know I&#x27;ve been thinking about another case to do well I was trying to think of another case to do I just I really couldn&#x27;t come up with you know one that I really wanted to do right now so I figured you would it would be a good idea to kind of go back and revisit a case which i had had done before which is the Danny casillero case which you know you guys you guys know with like with cases like like Danny&#x27;s I i referenced his case a lot in in a couple in a couple of different cases that were similar to this one like dave bob skates like and stuff like that so you know I&#x27;ve said it in bruges times you know this is my favorite case ever that was covered in unsolved mysteries like if I had to do like a top three it will probably go go gay casillero Dave box and probably the probably the coverage of area 51 like of that case you know I I enjoyed that too so yeah those should probably be my top three cases you know mainly the Danny casillero and day box case you know because those were like those were two cases that you know had like nobody knew what happened to those guys and you know there&#x27;s just there&#x27;s so many you know possible theories and stuff like that that you know people have come up with over the years and you know there&#x27;s just there&#x27;s just so many ways that like it like a case go like with the day in Castlederg cases from numerous conspiracy theories of stuff like that would put on it and you know basically for this video you know there was i look back in my video yesterday and you know there was some stuff i left out and stuff like that and you know I&#x27;ve done some more research on it and there is some stuff that was actually not covered in the show that i found on the web that I wanted to cover as well my theory on it won&#x27;t change really um you know but i&#x27;ll still give you my theory at the end of this when I&#x27;m when I&#x27;m done at all but yeah you know there&#x27;s there was some stuff that I did I had been reading on the internet you know which you know I had never heard about they didn&#x27;t talk about it on the show you know when I looked up on unsolved mysteries wikia it wasn&#x27;t up there and you know I&#x27;m not going to talk about like um like you know like the octopus like him investigating the octopus in the government the install case and all that i&#x27;m just i&#x27;m gonna skip all that because you guys probably already know all about that even though i didn&#x27;t cover it in my video at least i don&#x27;t think i did i&#x27;m sure you guys know all about it really what i&#x27;m going to do is just you know covered the last known sighting since-- death of the autopsy and you know really anything else that you know i found on here so i&#x27;m just going to get into it right now so this is the last known sightings of Dani Cavallaro so according to the village voice castle airs whereabouts between late august eighth and afternoon August ninth or unknown the day before he died according to the Martinsburg morning journal i ate at a pizza hut where he told the waitress that he liked her eyes and accorded the great gatsby to her he met the Honeywell engineer william richard turner at the sheraton at about two-thirty p.m. on August night Turner said he did Kessler some documents and that they spoke for a few minutes witnesses reported that casillero spent the next few hours at a martinsburg retro a bartender there told police that he seemed lonely and depressed the police further learned that Castro was seen at Heather fields the cocktail around lounge at the sheraton at around 5pm with a man described by the bio waitress as maybe Eric or Iranian at about five-thirty p.m. that night casillero happened to meet my Clooney who rented the room next Castle arrows room 517 the Chattan on two occasions first at about five-thirty p.m. and then again at around 8pm Looney later explaining that Danny said that he was there to meet an important source who is going to him what he needed to solve the case according to loony cazadero claimed that his source was scheduled to arrive by 9pm around that time kessler a left-wing explained that he had to make a telephone call he returned a few minutes later and said that his source might have blown him off Tesla on any talk to Lou at nine-thirty p.m. at about 10pm casillero bought coffee at a nearby convenience store that was the last time anyone reported seeing him alive so we&#x27;re getting to his death now which you know I had covered a little bit in case in my original own video of this so here we go at about noon on August 10th 1991 housekeeping staff discovered Castro&#x27;s naked tesoro naked in the bathtub of room 517 his wrists had been slashed deeply there were three or four moons on his right wrist and seven or eight on his left blood was splattered on the bathroom wall and floor and according to Ridgeway and bond the scene was so gruesome that one of the housekeeper&#x27;s fainted when she saw it under CASL arrows body paramedics found an empty milwaukee beer can two white plastic liner trash bags and a single razor blade there was a half one at the half empty wine bottle nearby ridgeway and bun right that nothing was placed in the tub or in the bathtub drain to prevent debris from draining away and none of the bath water was saved other than that other than the grease from seeing the hotel room is clean and orderly there was a legal pad and pen president on the desk a single page been torn from the pad you know which was a suicide note based on the note the absence of stroke the absence of a struggle no sign of a forced entry and the presence of alcohol police judge the case straightforward after inspecting the case or at the scene and they found four more razor blades in their envelopes in a small package police interviewed interviews further revealed that no one had seen nor heard anything suspicious the Martinsburg police contacted authorities in Fairfax Virginia who said they would notify caseros family so the first autopsy was performed on castles body at the university of virginia on august fourteenth 1991 the coroner determined that blood loss was the cause of death and that the death had occurred from from one to four hours before the body was discovered or roughly between 8am and 11pm or 11am on august at the day after katherine&#x27;s body was found Village Voice editor Dan Bischoff received an anonymous telephone call alerting him learning Henry Castle Arabs death by Tuesday helices 13th Ridgeway and bun right the rumors were flying and by the next day of the crazy started coming out of the woodwork they were vague substantial rumors that the Mafia was somehow involved and the wildest story suggested that the Undertaker was an employee of the CIA hired to clean up after at an agency assassination even at the funeral they write the family felt engulfed by mysteries as the ceremony ceremony drew to a close a highly decorated military officer in US Army dress reportedly arrived into the limousine accompanied by another man in plain clothes the military man approached the coffin before just before it was lowered into the ground Lana metal on the lid had saluted no one recognized them either men and to this day they have never been identified furthermore casillero was known to have complained numerous times about threatening or unsettling phone calls directed Adam often during laid up tune occurring late at night including those received by his housekeeper during his absences from his home after castle arrows death it was reported by several mainstream news organizations police re-examine room 517 the adjacent room stood 517 had been rented the evening of Castle arrows death one by my Clooney at the other by an unnamed family no one recorded to hearing anything unusual either on the night of August night through the morning of August 10th in January 1992 about five months after Castle roast after dr.</p>
<p>Frost of the virginia state medical examiner&#x27;s office confirmed another autopsy he returned a second suicide bird exciting blood loss is the cause of death for us that there were evidence of early stages of multiple sclerosis but the degree of severity was probably minor toxicology announce analysis uncovered traces of several drugs antidepressants as a Timon Fein I think is what that is an alcohol he wrote there was nothing present in any way they could have been incapacitated casillero so he would have been capable of struggling against an assailant let alone been sufficient to kill him Ron Rosenbaum a journalist and a journalist acquaintance of catsteros speculated in Vanity Fair the casillero may have intent may have intended his suicide to appear to be murder triggered visors hitch in order to have others look into the story after his death yeah so that was all from Wikipedia there now there&#x27;s another thing which I wanted to get into here okay Emma um so yeah yeah i was looking at another thing and it was just it was the same stuff that I&#x27;d already had already read so I&#x27;m not gonna get into that yeah you know there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a lot of different theories that I could come up with for this case you know one that I could come up with right now is you know possibly you know he was meeting with somebody that one of his contacts or something and you know they found out he was investigating them or something and you know maybe he had been drinking or something and then and then you know possibly he I cosplay the Sun this guy that he that casero was meeting with or whatever you know waited till his accountant I remember in the in the unsolved mystery segment that his brother actually said there was a bruise found on me on the head and on one on the arm I believed as well so and that there was also the tips the tips of three days fingernails were missing as well so you know possibly what could&#x27;ve happened was you know you know one of his contacts or something probably came and possibly you know you know him you know found out that he was investigating them or was investigating something involving them or something and you know what he probably did was you know probably stayed quiet like entered the room quietly you know probably like grabbed castle arrows aren&#x27;t hard and you know probably drew him back a little bit you know clubbed him in the head not enough to not enough to cut them or anything but enough you know that could uh where it could leave a bruise and possibly knock them out and then you know you probably you probably stripped him of his clothing you know slashed his wrists or whatever and you know made it look like a suicide I you know probably wrote the note I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know if they ever investigated the suicide note or not you know it actually see if oops if it was really caseros writing or not probably not because they discovered it was a suicide and you know there&#x27;s other things too like like they found bloody towels under the sink and stuff like that you know there is no strainer in the synchrony you know John Connolly who was a who is who is interviewed you know said that you know government have a rule in this company when they are in this country when they screw up they cover up you know like who you know who put the bloody towels under the sink you know who drained the same or who drained the UM the bathtub without a strainer it&#x27;s sloppy work so it would have been the work of the government but it could have been in like a work of of you know somebody else one of these contacts her people that Danny was investigating I wouldn&#x27;t think it would be the Mafia or something but you never know I just I just think that you know he he just he got into wrong home he got deep into like this the sub that&#x27;s world that he that he that he shouldn&#x27;t have been it with like these these different people like these bad people whoever they were and you know that&#x27;s how he got murdered you know they probably they found out that he was investigating him and you know did what I just explained so you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s always been my opinion on it I just I just have a hard time believing that you know he would um that he would cut his wrists like that you know like with with him to be squeamish of blood like that you know it would be hard to to imagine him doing that now another scenario two is like Kessler could have been drinking with somebody like one of his contacts or something and that would have happened that what I explained earlier could have happened as well you know that&#x27;s that&#x27;s just really my opinion on it really um we will we ever find out the case you know I don&#x27;t think so you know a police of you know ruled this is serious i don&#x27;t i don&#x27;t know if the family is still and still investigating it really I I would think so but I I really don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s been about 20 24 25 years since it happened so you know I really don&#x27;t know but um but you know that&#x27;s just my thoughts on you know and it was yeah I just like I wanted to revisit this case because it you know it was it was always one of my favorite it was my favorite case of unsolved mysteries you know I&#x27;d seen the segment you know like a whole bunch of times you know I was I was just always very fascinated with it now um now I can also what one what Ron Rosenbaum said um you know who is the journalists that was an acquaintance with castor oil that you know counselor could have could have and headed to suicide you appear to be a murder to have all things looking to look into the story after his death you know that&#x27;s a possibility but like that&#x27;s a good theory on it but you know like I said I just I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t see him you know cutting his wrists unless you know things were that bad you know because apparently like the bartender said he seemed lonely and depressed now I don&#x27;t know he could he he may he make could of he may could have committed suicide you know I don&#x27;t know you know certainly with his with his job is tough and you know all these threatening phone calls and stuff like that he was getting you know you he was under a lot of pressure and stuff like that you know trying to you know crack this case and get it you know solvent and stuff like that so you know he could have like I just I just I don&#x27;t see it I don&#x27;t see it now you know there is there is a thing that said you know he could have gotten himself like I could say in the intoxicated you know just so that you wouldn&#x27;t so that he could do it you know that&#x27;s a possibility but you know like I said I just I just have a hard time with um you know thinking that he would do it so you know I&#x27;m just gonna go with that with on with you know that he was murdered by one of these contacts you know that you that I you know he was meeting with for you know um more investigating or whatever maybe it was these people that were you know threatening him or something I don&#x27;t know um well yeah you know I just wanted to revisit this case you know and you know that&#x27;s pretty much all I got to say for this video right now if you like this video give a like subscribe comment in the comment section let me know your thoughts and theories on this case how you know as as you guys know as I&#x27;ve said you know this is my favorite case you know I&#x27;d love to hear other&#x27;s thoughts on this case you know just because there&#x27;s so many so many holes in it and so many theories that could have took in place so many things that could have happened and you know I just I love hearing other people&#x27;s theories on it so yeah if you have any theories just let me know and yeah you know that&#x27;s pretty much all i gotta say there may be another video tonight i&#x27;m not too sure
