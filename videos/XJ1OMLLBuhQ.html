            <p>hello everyone welcome to my channel and uh this channel is dedicated toward educational uh matters uh usually we study up on uh theories of everything cosmologies that uh are all encompassing but uh people don&#x27;t know anything about them uh usually proffered by somebody who spent their whole life working on it and uh did so with uh you know great persistence and uh never got recognized but for whatever reason I&#x27;ve studied it and I think that it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s something important for people to learn today is the 157th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory this was a theory that was put forward by Dewey B Larson back in the 20th century he died back in 1990 started his work about 60 years before then and uh had about a 20 25 year period of incubation during which he was doing um mainly inductive work and then he turned that around uh once he came up with his fundamental postulates in the late 1950s then he turned it around and started doing deductive work and began to write books and articles and he wrote many books many articles he uh has a basic uh you know two basic postulates and he derives an entire theoretical Universe from those the basic idea is that we live in a universe of motion not a universe of matter not a universe of energy energy and matter are merely kinds of motion and motion is the relationship between space and time space and time are therefore reciprocals of each other hence the reciprocal system of theory and motion is basically a fraction with time or space as the denominator and space or time as the numerator and um space and time really have no independent existence they only exist together in motion space and time are not the container of the universe rather they are the contents of the universe space and time both have their coordinate aspects meaning that they are three or more dimensions and they both have their clock aspects meaning that they progress they are always getting later and later or or in the idea of space always getting farther and farther apart and space and time both come only in discrete units there is a minimum unit of space and a minimum unit of time um and one unit of space in one unit of time one over one is the speed of light and so the speed of light which makes sense in a universe of motion the speed of light is the default or the origin of the universe um the universe doesn&#x27;t is not measured from zero it is measured from the speed of light meaning that half of the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and half of the universe is moving slower than the speed of light that&#x27;s that half that&#x27;s moving slower Larson calls that the material sector and that&#x27;s the sector that Einstein is referring to where he says nothing moves faster than the speed of light but Einstein is not referring to what Larson calls the cosmic Universe the half of the universe that&#x27;s moving faster than the speed of light where the rule is that nothing moves slower than the speed of light one sector uh the material sector is a sector that we know about the cosmic sector is the sector that we don&#x27;t know uh anything directly about but because of the reciprocal relation between space and time we recognize that everything about that universe is something that we know because uh all you have to do to understand the cosmic universe is to invert the material universe so um the cosmic universe is exactly the same as the material Universe except that space and time are inverted the relationships are inverted so if you have something over here in the material sector you have exactly it&#x27;s reciprocal over in the cosmic sector um and that will come into play I think even in this chapter here that we&#x27;re about to start we&#x27;re looking at his um 1979 book called Nothing But motion that covers primarily physics and a little bit of organic chemistry and uh we are about to start chapter seven which is called high speed motion now when he refers to high speed motion he&#x27;s basically talking about motion faster than the speed of light but for now I will uh be done talking uh out of my mouth and I will begin to speak Larson&#x27;s words read right off here of chapter seven as brought out in chapter three the space of our ordinary ordinary experience extension space as we have called it is simply a reference system and it has no real physical significance but the relationships that are represented in this reference system do have physical meaning for example if the distance between object a and object B in extension space is X then if a moves a distance in the direction a b while B remains stationary with respect to the reference system the two objects will come in contact the contact has observable physical results and the fact that it occurs at the coordinate position reached by object a after a movement defined in terms of the coordinates from a specific initial position in the coordinate system demonstrates that the relation represented by the difference between coordinates has a definite physical meaning Einstein calls this a metrical meaning that is a connection between the coordinate differences and measurable lengths and times to most of those who have not made any critical study of The Logical basis of so-called modern physics it probably seemed obvious that this kind of a meaning exists and it is safe to say that comparatively few of those who now accept Einstein&#x27;s relativity Theory because it is the Orthodox doctrine of in its field realize that his theory denies the existence of such a meaning but any analysis of The Logical structure of the theory will show that this is true and Einstein&#x27;s own statement on the subject previously quoted leaves no doubt on the score this is a prime example of a strange feature of the present situation in science the members of the scientific Community have accepted the basic theories of modern physics as correct and are quick to do battle on their behalf if they are challenged yet at the same time the majority are totally unwilling to accept some of the aspects of those theories that The Originators of the theories claim are essential features of the theoretical structures how many of the supporters of modern atomic theory for example are willing to accept Heisenberg&#x27;s assertion that atoms do not quote exist objectively in the same sense as stones or trees exists end quote probably about as many as are willing to accept Einstein&#x27;s assertion that coordinate differences have no metrical meaning at any rate the present General acceptance of the relativity Theory as a whole regardless of the widespread disagreement with some of its component parts makes it advisable to point out just where the conclusions reached in this area by development of the consequences of the postulates of the reciprocal system differ from the assertions of Relativity Theory this chapter therefore will be devoted to a consideration of the status of the relativity concept includes the extent to which the new findings are in agreement with it chapter 8 will then present the full explanation of motion at high speeds as it is derived from the new theoretical development it is worth noting in this connection that Einstein himself was aware of quote the eternally problematic character of his Concepts and in understand undertaking the Critical examination of his theory in this chapter We are following his own recommendation expressed in these words quote this is Einstein in the interest of science is it is necessary over and over again to engage in the critique of these fundamental concepts in order that they may not unconsciously rule us this becomes evident especially in those situations involving development of ideas in which the consistent use of the traditional fundamental concepts leads us to paradoxes difficult to resolve end quote back to Larson in spite of all the confusion and controversy that have surrounded the subject the factors that are involved are essentially simple and they can be brought out clearly by consideration of a correspondingly simple situation which for convenient reference we will call the two Photon case let us assume that a photon X originates at location o in a fixed reference system and moves linearly in space at unit velocity the velocity of light as all photons do in one unit of time it will have reached a point X in the coordinate system one spatial unit distant from o this is a simple matter of fact that results entirely from the behavior of photon X and is totally independent of what may be done by or to any other object similarly if another Photon y leaves Point O simultaneously with X and travels at the same velocity but in the opposite direction this Photon will reach point Y one unit of space distant from o at the end of one unit of elapsed time this too is entirely a matter of the behavior of the moving Photon Y and is independent of what happens to Photon X or to any other physical object at the end of one unit of time as currently measured X and Y are thus separated by two units of space in the coordinate system of reference in current practice some repetitive physical process measures time this process or the device in which it takes place is called a clock the progression of time thus measured is the standard time magnitude which on the basis of current understanding enters into physical relations speed or velocity the measure of motion is defined as distance per unit of time in terms of the accepted reference systems this means distance between coordinate locations divided by clock registration in the two Photon case the increase in coordinate separation during one unit of elapsed time is two units of space the relative velocity of the two photons determined in the standard manner is then two natural units that is twice the velocity of light the velocity at which each of the two objects is moving in 1887 an experiment by Mickelson and Morley compared the velocity of light traveling over round-trip paths in different directions relative to the direction of the Earth&#x27;s motion the investigators found no difference in the velocities although the accuracy of the experiment was far greater than would be required to reveal the expected difference had it been present this experiment together with others which have confirmed the original findings makes it necessary to conclude that the velocity of light in a vacuum is constant irrespective of the reference system the determination of velocity in the standard manner defy dividing distance traveled by elapsed time therefore arrives at the wrong answer at high velocities as expressed by kpac the initial impact of this discovery was shattering it seemed to undermine the whole structure of theoretical knowledge that had been erected by centuries of effort the following statement by Sir James Jean um I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s jeans or John written only a few decades after the event shows what a blow it was to the physicists of that Day quote for more than two centuries this system of laws the Newtonian universe was believed to give a perfectly consistent and exact description of the processes of nature then as the 19th century was approaching its close certain experiments commencing with the famous Mickelson Morley experiment showed that the whole scheme was meaningless and self-contradictory end call after a quarter of a century of confusion Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity which proposed a theoretical explanation of the discrepancy contradictions and uncertainties have surrounded this Theory from its Inception and there has been continued controversy over its interpretation in specific applications and over the nature and adequacy of the various explanations that have been offered in attempts to resolve the paradoxes and other inconsistencies but the mathematical successes of the theory have been impressive and even though the mathematics antidated the theory and are not uniquely connected with it these mathematical successes in conjunction with the absence of any serious competitor and the strong desire of the physicists to have something to work with have been sufficient to secure General acceptance now that a new theory has appeared however the defects in the relativity Theory acquire a new significance as the arguments which justify using a theory in spite of contradictions and inconsistencies if it is the only thing that is available are no longer valid when a new Theory free from such defects makes its appearance in making the more rigorous appraisal of the theory that is now required it should be recognized at the outset that a theory is not valid unless it is correct both mathematically and conceptually mathematical evidence alone is not sufficient as mathematical agreement is no guarantee of conceptual validity what this means is that if we devise a theoretical explanation of a certain physical phenomenon and then formulate a mathematical expression to represent the relations pictured by the theory or do the same thing in Reverse manner first formulating the mathematical expression on an empirical basis and then finding an explanation that fits it the mere fact that this mathematical expression yields results that agree with the corresponding experimental values does not assure us that the theoretical explanation is correct even if the agreement is complete and exact as a matter of principle this statement is not even open to question yet in a surprisingly large number of instances in current practice including the relativity Theory mathematical agreement is accepted as complete proof most of the defects of the relativity Theory are as a conceptual scheme have been explored in depth in the literature a comprehensive review of the situation at this time is therefore unnecessary but it will be appropriate to examine one of the long-standing paradoxes which is sufficient in itself to prove that the theory is conceptually incorrect naturally the adherence of the theory have done their best to resolve the Paradox and save the theory and in their desperate efforts they have managed to muddy the waters to such an extent that the conclusive nature of the case against the theory is not generally recognized okay we&#x27;ll stop there uh and so tomorrow we will get into his discussion of um the conceptual uh uh inconsistencies of um Einstein&#x27;s relativity theory in this one uh Avenue uh that is enough to kind of destroy the whole thing okay uh have a great day and uh thanks for tuning in we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow</p>
