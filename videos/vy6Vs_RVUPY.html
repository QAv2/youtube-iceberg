            <p>Let me make an example why the proprietary architecture will die out very quickly. If you want to strike a target with a swarm with, let&#x27;s say, different warheads, different capabilities, in order to not have interference on approaching and in order to maximize your effectiveness against air defense systems, you need to arrive on the target at the same moment, ideally from different directions. Um, which is I&#x27;m anticipating gunbased air defense systems. You basically want to outmaneuver the swivel or rotation speed of the defense turret. And that requires now that you need to perfectly coordinate your trajectory planning.</p>
