            <p>it would only be if it were the case that in fact we have mastered anti-gravity and they&#x27;re being built by Aerospace corporations then new physics would have to be involved the idea that there would be fundamental physics knowledge that would be housed in an aerospace company and not shared with the physics Community there is no evidence of that no evidence for it not that I know of and I would that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not the case but that would be this crazy egregious it would change our entire concept of who we are if somebody kept fundamental physics secret in the years since we became capable of exploding Fusion devices I would grab a pitchfork and a tiki torch and I would march on the National Science Foundation right right I don&#x27;t I still can&#x27;t believe that that&#x27;s true</p>
