            <p>It’s long been said that there have been many inventions that could have changed the world in a positive way. Yet, were denied from the public, or worse the inventor mysteriously died, making you wonder if someone didn&#x27;t want</p>
<p>their inventions getting out and impacting the way people live their lives. It all comes down to the thoughts that owners of the world&#x27;s largest oil, energy, banking and tobacco corporations do not have the public&#x27;s interest at heart and are</p>
<p>in it for greed and control over the population. Now we can’t say that is true, but when you hear about the inventions that could have changed the way we do things, in particular be cheaper and more efficient for the mass population and the environment.</p>
<p>It does make you think whether these huge companies have us and the planet in mind. Because, form the invention of a harmless cigarette that was created many years ago, to the countless free energy generators, here are five inventions</p>
<p>that were suppressed, with most of their inventors suffering from mysterious and untimely deaths. Tom Ogle In 1978 at the age of 19, a young man called Tom Ogle stumbled upon an invention by pure luck that could have changed the automotive industry.</p>
<p>It all started when he was fiddling around with his lawn mower and accidentally punctured a hole in it’s fuel tank. As opposed to patching it up, he used a vacuum line, and ran it from the tank, straight</p>
<p>into the carburettor inlet. Ogle was amazed when the mower kept running but the fuel level hardly moved. And it continued to tick over for 96 hours straight on half a tank of fuel.</p>
<p>Over the next five years Ogle made hundreds of experiments on his own Ford Galaxie, but removed the carburettor and fuel pump, and replaced them with a secret black box he called a filter. And the car went from under</p>
<p>20 miles per gallon to 100. Ogle maintained he was able to achieve this due to his secret pressurized, vaporised fuel system that injected fumes directly into the engine&#x27;s firing chamber. Meaning, the device would not only</p>
<p>get incredible mileage, but exhaust emissions were also practically nonexistent. Now at age 24, he notified the press of his invention and claimed he was going to showcase it by driving from El Paso, Texas to Deming, New Mexico aiming to complete the 200 mile trip</p>
<p>on just two gallons of gas. Reporters and experts turned up to witness this feat and inspected his car for hidden fuel tanks. And when they were unable to find any discrepancies and Ogle made the journey, he was hailed as the inventor of an energy saving</p>
<p>device that also cleaned up emissions. However despite the initial excitement and funding, there were rumors that other people had similar patents, including General Motors, who had patented a similar device several years earlier.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, everyone who shared Ogle’s passion for this fuel and emission saving process started to wipe their hands with him and suggest it would never work. His royalties and payments stopped, and the man who was once offered 25 million</p>
<p>dollars by Shell Oil was broke. His marriage broke up and he became dependent on drink and drugs. Then in 1981, Tom was shot outside of a bar in El Paso and died later that night</p>
<p>at a friend&#x27;s apartment. His death was recorded as a suicide after autopsy reports indicated he had overdosed on drugs and alcohol. Although many of his friends said he would</p>
<p>never have killed himself despite his current struggles, and that he had been saying for a while that he thought someone was putting drugs in his drinks. The person who shot him was never found.</p>
<p>Many questions still remain about Tom Ogle, like who shot him, why were no cars ever fitted with his invention, and what happened to the so-called other patents for a similar fuel saving device. In Tom’s own words, when asked if he was afraid of</p>
<p>oil companies or the Arabs coming after him. He responded with: &quot;No. Not any more. I’ve had too much publicity.&quot; &quot;If I’d kept my invention a secret I might be worrying.&quot; &quot;But there’s nothing to</p>
<p>worry about any more.&quot; The question is, was Tom right, and was his invention that well known? Or is this the first time you heard about it? Stanley Allen Meyer Stanley Meyer and his twin Stephen, were born in Columbus East Side on August 24, 1940, From an early age both were building things and coming up with their own inventions.</p>
<p>As an adult, Stanley gained some impressive credentials, attending Ohio State University, working for NASA, and being involved in the development of the Gemini and Star Wars projects. During all of this, Stanley and his engineer brother built up a multi-million dollar transport</p>
<p>and spare parts business and Stanley was the author of over 42 patents. Including inventions in Oceanology, cardiac monitoring and banking systems. But his most famous was</p>
<p>the Water Fuel Cell, which he claimed could allow an automobile to run on water fuel rather than gasoline. The water fuel cell supposedly split water into its two elements, hydrogen and oxygen, then burned the hydrogen to generate energy.</p>
<p>Stanley claimed the device required less energy to perform electrolysis than the minimum energy requirement measured by conventional science. He demonstrated his invention to Professor Michael Laughton, Dean of Engineering at</p>
<p>Mary College in London, Admiral Sir Anthony Griffin, a former controller of the British Navy, and Dr Keith Hindley, a UK research chemist. They were all in agreement that the cell produced far more hydrogen/oxygen mixture than could have been expected</p>
<p>by simple electrolysis, making the impossible possible by turning ordinary tap water into hydrogen fuel, efficiently enough to power his dune buggy. Despite some hailing Stanley as a genius and visionary, there were others who believed he was</p>
<p>a fraud and still do to this day. You see his &quot;Water Fuel Cell&quot; was later examined by three experts in court who found that there &quot;was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all,&quot; and that: &quot;it was simply using conventional electrolysis.&quot; The court found Meyer had</p>
<p>committed &quot;gross fraud&quot; and ordered him to repay two investors their $25,000. After this, nothing more came about it. Then, nearly 20 years after researching</p>
<p>and perfecting the concept of his Water Fuel System, Stanley and Stephen dined out with their latest Belgian investors in the Grove City Cracker Barrel on March 20th, 1998. Stanley took one sip of the cranberry juice he had just ordered before grabbing his neck and</p>
<p>running out the door, dropping to his knees and vomiting violently. He died there and then and his last words were: &quot;They poisoned me!&quot; At the age of 57, Stanley Meyers, the man who claims he could have ended</p>
<p>reliance on fossil fuels forever was dead. Many of the key elements of his invention died with him, as the water fuel cell was never fully completed and never released. Despite a detailed investigation</p>
<p>by police, the eventual cause of death was listed as a brain aneurism. His brother Stephen who is the only one who knows the way forward with Stanley&#x27;s invention has refused to have anything to do with it or complete his brothers work after watching what</p>
<p>he went through, convinced the invention would change the automotive world forever and for this reason his brother was killed. The question is, was he really a fraud: no vehicle manufacturer has incorporated</p>
<p>Meyer&#x27;s work, despite the patent expiring and his inventions going into the public domain, available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment. Lester Hendershot Lester Jennings Hendershot was born in 1898 in West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, and grew up to be an inventor</p>
<p>of many practical items. His most significant was th  groundbreaking generator that was powered by nothing but the earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and was able to power several appliances in his home.</p>
<p>Needless to say, top scientists were unable to explain it and knew that if it could be perfected, it could eliminate the need for conventional electricity in every household around the planet.</p>
<p>It all came out in 1925, when Lester was taking flying lessons and realized the need for a 100% reliable compass. While trying to produce one he realized the power of the earth’s magnetic field and it gave him the idea to produce</p>
<p>a motor utilising this free energy. As work progressed on the motor, he began to realize that a magnetically powered motor may not work as well as a magnetically powered generator, so he concentrated on making one.</p>
<p>Soon it was making news headlines and even Col Lindbergh and the military began showing interest. However, the initial flurry of excitement worn off, as many started to claim</p>
<p>Hendershot was a fake, even going to the length of displaying a supposed generator of his in front of the public and proving it did not work. After this, it became apparent to those who supported Hendershot, that there were people who were</p>
<p>set on discrediting the invention. Hendershot still continued for many years with his free energy generator. In late 1960s, he was convinced he had an opportunity to present it to the US Navy.</p>
<p>He produced two models, and a 56-page proposal but there was little interest. Then a year later, in April 1961, Hendershot&#x27;s son returned from school and found his father dead. His death was recorded as suicide, although</p>
<p>no investigation was ever carried out. Many, including his family believe he was killed, as he was a threat to the large energy companies, as he would continue to progress with his invention. It was also reported that Hendershot</p>
<p>had been approached by a large corporation who he refused to name, that apparently told him to stop all activity in connection with his motor or generator. All hendershot would say, was that if he were successful with his generator, it would be a serious threat to</p>
<p>their multimillion dollar industry. It&#x27;s thought he accepted $25,000 on the condition that he did not build another unit for twenty years. He had also told his family at times</p>
<p>that he feared of his life. It’s wrong to blame someone for being responsible for Hendershots death, but given the fact he was convinced his generator did produce power and perfected could be revolutionary, it seems no one was interested in what he had</p>
<p>come up with and you can’t help but wonder why. The Palladium Cigarette Every year, around five million smokers and over half a million non-smokers exposed to second hand smoke die from tobacco related deaths.</p>
<p>But what if in the 1950s one scientist came up with a cigarette without the carcinogenic chemicals? His name was Dr James D Mold, and he worked for the North Carolina tobacco company Liggett &amp; Myers. His role was to test the harmful</p>
<p>effects of tobacco on lab mice. Through his studies, he was able to isolate the materials in cigarettes that caused skin cancer. Armed with this knowledge, he started a project to produce a safer cigarette that would eliminate or at least minimize</p>
<p>the harmful ingredients. Mold&#x27;s project became known as Project XA and at first he had the backing of Liggett &amp; Myers. It took James 25 years to produce a cigarette that relied on the use of</p>
<p>palladium and magnesium nitrate to destroy the substances in cigarette smoke that caused cancer. He called it the Palladium Cigarette. However after talks with lawyers, Liggett &amp; Myers</p>
<p>withdrew their backing. It’s hard to believe but lawyers had advised that launching a safer product would lead to lawsuits from customers of their original product, as it would be admitting they were unsafe.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t forget this was around the time where it was fashionable and in fact deemed healthy to smoke cigarettes. Unable to continue with his work, James was requested by Liggett &amp; Myers not to publish anything about his finding</p>
<p> and 25 years of work was abandoned. At this time Liggett and other tobacco companies continued to sell cancer causing cigarettes, with the general public unaware of the harm they were causing. Dr Mold had effectively been</p>
<p>gagged by the company. He died in 2002 knowing he could have saved the lives of countless people if it were not for the tobacco companies and their refusal to admit that they knew how dangerous smoking was.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s even more upsetting is that now tobacco companies have to state how dangerous smoking is but nothing seems to have come about from Dr Molds work. And this could have happened many years ago, potentially preventing an</p>
<p>untold number of lives. Dimitri Petronov This next person is the most mysterious in this video, but the information on him is seriously lacking. We do know he definitely</p>
<p>existed and that he definitely died under suspicious circumstances. His name was Dimitri Petronov and he was born in Kiev in 1952, but went on to study at the best Engineering School in Berlin, and later worked for an aviation</p>
<p>company for over 20 years. In his spare time, Petronov invented things. His first being a very bright LED flashlight that gained some interest although</p>
<p>was considered expensive. He then created a plasma battery, which he maintained could operate for 3 years without being recharged. He went on to use one to apparently</p>
<p>power his entire house. Now Dimitri admitted the battery was technically nuclear but only emitted the same levels of radiation as a mobile phone. As word got around, in 2009 Dimitri was</p>
<p>invited to visit a Military Lab in Moscow to demonstrate his device in front of generals. Petronov was gone for a week and took a duplicate device with him which the Military kept. When he returned, his sister said</p>
<p>he was very excited and although he said he couldn&#x27;t talk about the details of the meeting, he told her the Military had agreed to fund him, as long as it was only used in Russia. Then just a week after the meeting, Dimitri had a visit from a smartly dressed man who introduced himself</p>
<p>as Vladimir. After the visit according to his sister, Dimitri seemed different. Just a few months later on Feb 13th, 2010, Dimitri went out for a coffee as he usually did</p>
<p>on a Saturday morning, then picked up some bread from a bakery, and that was the last time he was seen or heard from. When his sister returned from the police station after reporting him missing, there was no electricity in the house, and it turns out that neighbors saw two military</p>
<p>men entering her and her brothers property and leaving with Dimitri’s plasma battery. 2 weeks later and no closer to finding out what happened to her brother, his sister received a parcel containing Dimitri’s watch.</p>
<p>Now, what happened next I can’t be certain of, but over a year after his disappearance a decomposed body was pulled from Russia&#x27;s Volga River but their teeth and hands were missing making identification impossible. There is speculation that</p>
<p>this was Dimitri Petronov, the man who apparently powered his entire house on a single homemade plasma battery, because if this wasn&#x27;t his body, then where has he gone? So that&#x27;s five inventions that could have changed the way we live either in health or finances or by the effect that we have on the planet.</p>
<p>Thanks for watching, and I&#x27;ll see you again in the next video.</p>
