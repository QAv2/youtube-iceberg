            <p>the Golden Age of Relativity was a wild forgotten time in the history of American physics this was a period in the 50s where the study of anti-gravity yeah you heard me right anti-gravity experienced a dramatic Resurgence of Interest not just among quacks among real physicists but constant Improvement Roger Babson a patron of science was obsessed with finding the solution to anti-gravity his Gravity Research Foundation held a popular essay contest which garnered contributions from many of the top Minds at the time meanwhile another industrialist Agnew bainson started the Institute of field physics in North Carolina also dedicated to the study of anti-gravity</p>
