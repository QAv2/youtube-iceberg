            <p>the jogan experience the stuff is landing or crashing around the world and unexpected countries have had this happen and that&#x27;s why I picked that because I thought that was a interesting case and then of course the you know pop P the 12 and the Vatican were involved back channeling it through the OSS which became the CIA later to FDR and that&#x27;s how the US knew something weird happened in Italy during well right before World War II but so this is 33 was the first like documented uh that is the earliest one I can talk about yeah there something that predates that might you could infer that you could infer that yeah so this 331 you said was in Italy yeah magenta so it&#x27;s uh I&#x27;m bad at geography I think that&#x27;s like Lombardi region it&#x27;s like Northern Northwest Italy and what&#x27;s the story behind it so um basically it it it looked like it crashed right it the original shape most likely was like a lenticular disc like craft you know with like a two dinner plates where lenticular mean so like two dinner plates you know smooshed together right the hump and there&#x27;s like a you know like a bubble on top classic classic like like that like that okay but it looks like when it hits the edges broke off so it became this like Bell or Acorn shaped thing um and there was nothing in it it was like just an artifact you know there was no biological remnants if you will um so it&#x27;s so funny because the Italians were so confused they actually called up the Germans and they were like is this one of Y vava like what the hell just crashed in Northern Italy musolini um and this is all publicly available information because some Italian researchers um found all these original documents that some people were sitting on for years in Italy uh you know they put a gag gag order on the press Etc and yeah melini asked the Germans to come down and of course the Germans came down and they were like uh that is not ours but let&#x27;s look at it together so that&#x27;s kind of uh perhaps a tertiary reason the kind of aess powers got together I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s like the reason but I think the Italians and the Germans were so intrigued with what they found from like an artifact perspective there was at least some scientific and Military uh collaboration during the or the details of which I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not sure of but I know people that know that specific event that are currently still Intel officers within this program uh in detail but yeah so was there witnesses to the crash or some sort of an understanding that something had crash landed and then they discovered it yeah I I forget the precise Discovery uh I don&#x27;t know if it was like uh local police officers or local farmers found in the field something like that I I don&#x27;t want to misspeak um I assume some of the Italian researchers might have some fact witnesses that can orally say oh yeah my my great-grandfather found it or something like that but I don&#x27;t remember I&#x27;m what was the scale of this vehicle uh it was probably like like 20 feet by 10t something like that not super huge but kind of big do they think that this was a drone do they think that this was occupied there was nothing in it so if it if it was uh piloted if you will by some sent I mean your your guess is as good as mine so H so what happened to that vehicle so we knew where it was being stored at a a particular location um after the crash and then the military came in and we we grabbed it towards the end of the war you know 1944 1945 because like I said pop Pi the 12th already kind of let uh FDR know why did the Pope get involved because it&#x27;s in Italy well interestingly enough there&#x27;s like a whole history of human intelligence prior to World War II and uh old money the Vatican the Italian mob um kind of the old country boys did a lot of informal intelligence collection uh for the US and and there&#x27;s probably some books you can read on it but it&#x27;s really interesting you know human intelligence collection wasn&#x27;t really formalized until the office office of strategic Services the OSS which became the CIA in 1947 and um you had um you know Paul melon and all these other affluent guys of all these old money families that basically created the CIA so that&#x27;s probably the reason why so this thing that was recovered this was the first documented one that the United States had access to I can&#x27;t get into if it was the first or not but okay it was an early one very early yeah so it&#x27;s almost 100 years ago yes and so so they take this thing and then they bring it where yeah I can&#x27;t I can&#x27;t get into those can&#x27;t get into okay so they bring it somewhere in the United States and uh was the attempt to try to back engineer this thing was the attempt to try to understand what it was yeah I mean first of it obviously it&#x27;s understanding the situation right what do we have our hands on and and like I&#x27;ve said in some other videos and stuff you know that we took the Manhattan Project secrecy and overlaid it on this issue because that secrecy worked well for atomic bomb developments and whatnot and and certainly this whole program in a nutshell if I were to like summarize the 90 plus years of History it is a reverse engineering program to Garner some kind of insight uh and of course not a lot of the things that we&#x27;ve learned from it are like directly you know ripped off the technology we found but it has inspired other innovations that made its way into other us classified programs over the year for National Defense reasons you know and it&#x27;s a myriad of different things so the the UFO folklore is that this is where fiber optics were discovered first yeah I&#x27;m not going to break the seal on anything we&#x27;ve discovered or anything like that and yeah it&#x27;s place I can&#x27;t go how limited are you in what you can discuss and what you can&#x27;t discuss and why why do they let you discuss any of this yeah so anything sens that I want to say as it relates to like US Government activity whether it be intelligence stuff military Stuff Etc I have to submit it through what they call doser Dod office of pre-publication and Security review that is something anybody who&#x27;s been an Intel officer anybody with like a clearance has to submit that kind of stuff now obviously if you&#x27;re writing a book about gardening you don&#x27;t have to but if you&#x27;re going to talk about anything military and intelligence related you have to submit so it&#x27;s kind of a catch 22 for this office right they&#x27;re only looking at it from a security perspective they&#x27;re not vouching for it or anything like that and that&#x27;s like any author right they could write a a book about Navy Seals and they&#x27;re not vouching for the story they&#x27;re vouching that you didn&#x27;t say any nasty code words you didn&#x27;t burn a specific ongoing classified program and for them I mean I&#x27;m not in their udal Loop but certainly it&#x27;s a catch22 for them where if they want to redact and they propose a redaction they&#x27;re like Dave you can&#x27;t say these sentences you can rewrite it and resubmit you know we can&#x27;t necessarily tell you uh what agency said to redact it but you&#x27;re not allowed to say this uh they would be basically self-certifying there&#x27;s a there there so in my opinion probably the policy is like if it has to deal with the subject we&#x27;re not saying anything we&#x27;re not proposing any redactions as as long as he&#x27;s not burning a conventional program uh we kind of have to allow him to exercise his first amendment rights and I so I think it&#x27;s like a catch 22 for that office is kind of the long or the short of the long answer so so this is essentially one of the very early ones 1933 MH how many crash retrieval incidents have there been it is double digit uh the specific numbers I do know however I can&#x27;t discuss that I know it sounds like oh I&#x27;m being koi or whatever but you know this show any other interviews I do WR you know foreign intelligence services are watching and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not here to help Russia and China calibrate their intelligence collection like oh Dave said it&#x27;s this number we missed a couple [ __ ] let&#x27;s put it out for the KGB svr and Gru are now going to hit the streets to try to figure out which ones they miss so I&#x27;m I&#x27;m here to protect National Security and I&#x27;m just trying to put all the general topics out there for public convers ation to hold our government accountable really so because I&#x27;m I&#x27;m here as a fact witness because we have a you know a constitutional oversight issue because this program has not been you know reported to Congress in the appropriate way you know and I can get into a senator I talked to that has died recently so I can you know explain to you why I&#x27;m so sure besides what I read which we can get into the what Intel Port reports I read I did get some stuff cleared um so during my investigation I&#x27;m like you know what I need to talk to somebody at the highest levels right so and this will give you an idea of the kind of people we talk to and this is the only one I&#x27;m going to talk about using their name because they died two years ago so in Spring 2021 I actually flew with a couple colleagues of mine to Las Vegas and I met with Senator Harry Reid about nine months before he died and of course he&#x27;s a private citizen now and I wanted to brief him on the topic and I wanted to get his kind of thought leadership on it because you know he was a gang of eight member right you know which is the top most cleared senators in Congressman he was the majority leader for God&#x27;s sakes of the Senate and I knew you know he helped sponsor the assap program that I mentioned and where they looked at Skinwalker Ranch and some other things and I wanted understand like what does Harry Reid actually know like why did he you know give $21 million to DIA in Bigalow Aerospace for this so I&#x27;m sitting there in Harry Reid&#x27;s living room you know right next to him with some other witnesses that were there with me and he straight up says he&#x27;s like yeah I knew we had UFO material I was denied access for decades I tried to get access and then he explains some of his efforts during assap uh and I was like holy [ __ ] did the the former Majority Leader just say did he just confirm this to me as well you know I was already talking to these amazing highlevel people but I have Harry Reid literally saying yes we have material and you know he knew it was non-human did Harry Reid have personal experience with this I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s had any personal stuff in his personal life I mean did he see it did he winess in terms of seeing the material himself he said he was denied access for years or decades was his term and he actually told me on behalf of me he was going so he had like a weekly call with President Joe Biden at the time and he straight up said to me he was gonna talk to President Biden about this issue literally and then uh what he was telling me about assap um I was like holy [ __ ] I have like 20 other people that told me this dude so the real history what [ __ ] assap was because I think there&#x27;s a lot of people out there that think they were looking at ghosts Skinwalker Ranch yes they went to the ranch as a secondary inter tertiary objective but the real uh reason so like there&#x27;s a document that came out a couple years ago through Foya from the defense intelligence agency there was this special access Pro program requests that Harry Reid you might have seen this I think like George Napp and Company have reported on this that he sent to the deputy secretary defense William Lynn and it was asking for one of the most serious saps you can ask for what they call a bigoted waved special Access program so waved means it&#x27;s limited Congressional reporting um that is a class of special access programs and bigoted means it&#x27;s like by name and it&#x27;s like it was like you could read the foyet document it was like you know Harry readed James inhoff uh Lando Etc I&#x27;m like why are you asking for the most serious sap to be created for a program that ostensibly is looking at Skinwalker Ranch and stuff and it doesn&#x27;t make any sense so what really happened there and uh you know Harry mean Harry Reid God bless his soul made this disclosure um a couple weeks after we met uh in the New Yorker and you can look this up I think it was like a May 2021 New Yorker story where he says I knew for decades and he made this disclosure not me so I&#x27;m going to say the name of the contractor Harry Reed said this uh you know we knew that lockie Martin had this material for decades I tried to get access and I was denied and specifically with the lockie Martin stuff he was talking about during the assap program and for the people who are on this program I submitted this [ __ ] to officer got this cleared so don&#x27;t freak out but I&#x27;m telling the truth here um so lockie Martin wanted to divest itself from this material at a specific facility that&#x27;s known to me that I provided to the Inspector General um like street address all that [ __ ] right and the idea was if they made a catcher m a security catcher mitt for this [ __ ] at you know most serious sa possible the contractor and the other government customer which was the Central Intelligence Agency um for that specific locki material and it was [ __ ] that they recovered from like the 50s and stuff and it was like bits and pieces of of of of like Hall structure [ __ ] like that and um uh so they were going to Tech transfer it and the 21 or $22 million was actually for Bigalow Aerospace to build out you know facilities in Las Vegas and material analysis equipment and I&#x27;ve SE I have I saw the staff meeting slides I saw the paperwork like there&#x27;s a paperwork Trail I&#x27;ve seen on this [ __ ] and I talk to the people involved in this program</p>
