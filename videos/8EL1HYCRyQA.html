            <p>hello everyone and welcome to my channel uh this is an educational Channel and we look at uh different great theories of everything and do deep dives into them and show you how to use them or help to show you how to use them and what they&#x27;re about and uh today is our 484th video that we&#x27;ve done on the reciprocal system of theory from Dewey B Larson Mr Larson was an American engineer who lived in the 20th century he died in 1990 but not before he wrote about 12 or 12 books or so and 50 articles and gave a lot of talks and uh had a little bit of a following and had a little Journal going on with other contributors and um that all kind of started where after he wrote put out his two fundamental postulates in like 1959 just two sentences about how he believed the universe operated and then he elaborated those postulates through a a process of deduction into a theoretical universe so what his Universe would look like if his postulates were correct and then he compared his postulates with or his theoretical Universe with the uh empirical universe of the modern scientists and you know so if his Universe looks a lot like their Universe then then you would probably think that his postulates were pretty accurate and so that&#x27;s kind of what we have here we&#x27;re going over chapter 11 of his book called basic properties of matter this book is pretty much on chemistry Larson drives equations for many of the basic properties of matter like the melting point and the specific heat and the compressibility of different atoms and then he plugs in all the atoms and many molecules into his different equations and then he Compares his results with the results that are uh from the scientific tables that have been established from laboratory experiments of the modern scientists uh and so you know this provides I think pretty good demonstration that lson was on to something maybe not completely right um but he&#x27;s articulating a general theory so he uses the same theory for chemistry as he uses for astronomy that he uses for economics that he uses for metaphysics and uh some of his uh disciples are you know so to speak have plugged it into other subjects geology and meteorology um philosophy religion so uh this is a general theory but in order to understand how the theory operates uh we look we&#x27;re looking at many of the chemistry relations uh he did uh several important chapters that we just covered uh having to do with heat and temperature and pressure now we&#x27;re on to uh some stuff having to do with electricity and magnetism and this chapter here is called uh Thermo Electric property uh we started this chapter yesterday and so we will be doing the second installment here today now let me uh tell you that if you want to get a a thorough semi thorough at least uh once over on the reciprocal system you want to go and watch one of my first 474 videos on the reciprocal system um I took the time to explain the reciprocal system 474 different times but I&#x27;m finding that if I do that I can&#x27;t cover ground very well like so I want to kind of just be able to read the text get the text read into the record here of Larson&#x27;s books and I&#x27;m not able to turn as many pages if I provide a a thorough explanation of the reciprocal system every time so for purposes of this video I&#x27;m pretty much just going to assume that you have at least passing knowledge of the reciprocal system and you can follow along at least to a certain level I&#x27;ll try to explain uh you know Larson is always getting into the weeds and always uh getting into you know stuff that we don&#x27;t understand um sometimes I don&#x27;t understand um if I do I&#x27;ll try to explain it uh but the basic gist of the reciprocal system is that we live in a universe made out of motion not matter not energy not force but motion and for Larson uh it is a specific kind of motion that he calls scalar motion a motion that has a magnitude but has no specific Direction and to model that you would use a balloon that you put dots on if you blow up Theo balloon all the dots will be moving away from each other but they won&#x27;t be moving in any specific Direction every dot will be moving in every direction outward and um you know every dot will be moving away from every other dot that is a scalar motion and that&#x27;s also been observed um uh in the distant galaxies all of the distant galaxies are moving away from you each other now that was used to justify uh or to you know really come up with the big bang um but uh you can also use it to come up with the uh expanding balloon depending on whether you want to have a center or not uh if you have the center of that balloon as the origin that would be where our Galaxy is located or you could say that our galaxy is also participating in the expansion uh along with all of these distant galaxies which makes a lot more sense to me and to Larson as well uh anyway so we&#x27;ve got the scalar motion and that&#x27;s what the universe is constructed out of that is the source and uh this outward motion of the balloon and manifestation comes from taking that source and harnessing it through uh first reversing that direction of the balloon and then eventually reeling it in and moving it rotating it moving it into a inward direction of the balloon so when you have that Contracting balloon then that is what you would call gravitation and that is where you have atoms and matter and and um so that is like manifestation so so the whole process of manifestation is turning that outward balloon outward Mo moving balloon into an inward moving balloon so when we get the inward moving balloon you got all of the dots are moving toward each other um but it&#x27;s important to note that they are not and they&#x27;re not moving in any specific Direction but it appears as if there&#x27;s force fields there so if you decide arbitrarily to hold one of the dots motionless and say that you know this dot is motionless all the other dots will be moving toward that one dot and it will be appear as if there is a force field emanating from that dot that it will be carrying a force of attraction and all the other dots are attracted to that first dot but that&#x27;s not the case every dot is just moving under its own course and but it happens to be moving toward every other dot so it will be moving toward the dot that you are holding motionless the reference dot Larson calls that an as if force and that&#x27;s why gravity doesn&#x27;t need any time to transmit there is no um uh there is no um Force at a distance the force is inherent in each body and so it&#x27;s instantaneous now the other aspect of Larson system is that motion is the relationship between space and time that posits a generalized reciprocal relationship between space and time you can see that in speed uh the most basic kind of motion that we know of uh the car is going 12 miles per hour 12 miles of space and one hour of time that&#x27;s a relationship between space and time and that is a fraction with space or time as the numerator time or space as the denominator all forms of scientific phenomena are forms of motion and they are all fractions with space or time as the numerator and time or space as the denominator with the idea that space or time uh have can have exponents can be to the first power to the second power to the third power or more and um so larsson&#x27;s first postulate which is where he does um you know most of the his original thinking here is that the universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two re reciprocal aspects space and time space and time do not exist separately they only exist together in motion and um the progression is at the rate of one unit of space per one unit of time everything is quantized in the reciprocal system everything comes in whole units and um you know you have three-dimensional relationships but you have three dimensions of space you also have three dimensions of time because time and space are recip reciprocals they have the same Quant qualities so uh that&#x27;s what Larson calls coordinate space and coordinate time but in order to describe coordinate space or coordinate time you only need one dimension of motion and there are also three dimensions of motion scalar motion and so that is beyond uh the reference system beond beyond the spatial reference system and the temporal reference system he calls that the natural reference system that is the progression of that balloon outward at the speed of one unit of speed one unit of space per one unit of time which is also known as the speed of light and so that is the progression of the natural reference system the source of this universe is outward Motion in all directions at the speed of light from all locations at all times so this progression is is occurring I&#x27;m presently and um you know it is what Larson calls the empty Universe there is nothing this is this is what you have when you have nothing you have the motion outward in all directions at the speed of light from all locations at all times and um that is just the nature of a universal motion you have to be able to assume U motion without any moving the thing that would be moving is also motion because matter is a kind of motion too time to the third power over space to the third power is is matter okay now let&#x27;s uh let&#x27;s get into the text here of thermoelectric properties now an electron uh in LaRon system can be charged or uncharged so that is another important thing that you have to remember and in LaRon system an electron is a rotating unit of space matter is generally made out of time rotations elect uh two dimensional rotations reeling in that progression um and so matter is three sets of rotations two of which are twodimensional and but they are primarily made out of time and since the relationship between space and time is motion the electron which is a rotating unit of time of space it moves through time so electrons move through matter and uh particularly you know those made mostly out of time and um but in some cases they heat up that motion that&#x27;s called resistance and that gives rise to uh thermoelectric properties okay so that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s talking about here okay the status of the electron motion as positive or negative is determined by the position that the interacting atom occupies in its rotational group in the same manner as the effective electric displacement of the atom each each of these rotational groups consists of two divisions that are positive from the atomic standpoint followed by two negative divisions but since the electron is a single rotating system instead of a double rotating system of the atomic type the various subdivisions of the atomic series are reduced to half size in application to the electrons the reversals from positive to negative therefore occur at every divisional boundary in the electronic process rather than at every second division identification of individual elements as positive or negative from the thermoelectric standpoint is necessarily subject to some qualifications because as previously noted some elements are positive in one temperature range and negative in another but a reasonably good test of the theoretical conclusions that can be accomplished by comparing the sign of the thermoelectric power as observed at 0° C with the divisional status of the elements for which thermoelectric data are available in one of the recent compilations table 26 um in one of the recent compilations table 27 presents such a comparison omitting the division one elements of displacements one and two uh so he&#x27;s got a chart here and um not sure exactly what he&#x27;s getting at here but he&#x27;s BAS basically you know he&#x27;s got four divisions of matter 1 2 3 and four uh division one is an electropositive with a veence of four or less division four is an electro negative with a veence of four or less and then uh division two is an electropositive with a large veence division three is an electro negative with large veence and uh he&#x27;s kind of got them divided up but you know the point that he&#x27;s making is that since the electron is just uh got one rotating system one Photon uh because that&#x27;s you start with the photon you rolling back that progression you start with the photon that vibrates vibrates it puts it makes it still and um then then it still needs to be rotated but you got to have that Photon first so a subatomic particle like an electron has one Photon at the center but an atom has two photons at the center and so he&#x27;s saying that uh normally um things are reversing every other division you&#x27;re reversing the order of things but with in the case of the electron since the electron&#x27;s only half a unit you&#x27;re actually reversing it every unit so um the sign is reversed and when you cross from division one to division two from division two to division three and from division three to four as opposed to just between two and three I believe that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying okay uh the reason for the misss from the tabulation is that the first two division one elements of each rotational group follow follow a distinctive pattern of their own in these elements the factor controlling the thermoelectric power is the magnetic rotational displacement rather than the electric displacement because of the single rotation of the electron the range of magnetic displacements from 1 one to 44 becomes uh sorry I&#x27;m lost my place here uh 1 one to 44 becomes two divisions with the reversal of sign at the boundaries for reasons of symmetry the interior section from 22 to 33 constitutes One Division in which the displacement one elements sodium potassium rubidium have negative thermoelectric voltages the corresponding members of the outer group groups lithium cesium have positive uh voltages the displacement two elements may follow either the magnetic or electric P pattern one of those included in the reference tabulation calcium has the same negative voltage as its neighbor potassium but magnesium the corresponding member of the next lower group takes the positive voltage of the higher division one elements while the theoretical development that is being described in this work has not yet been extended to the quantitative aspects of the thermoelectric effects effects thus far discussed uh it is of interest to note that the relation of the thermoelectric power to temperature has many of the characteristics that we encountered in our previous examination of the response of uh other properties of matter to temperature changes this is well ill Illustrated in figure 16 which shows the relation between temperature and the absolute thermoelectric power of platinum uh without the captions it would be difficult to distinguish the diagram from one applicable to thermal expansion or to the specific heat of an element of one of the lower groups this is no accident the curves look alike because the same basic factors are applic applicable in all of these cases uh then so he&#x27;s got figure of platinum here I don&#x27;t have access to but in the Platinum curve the initial level is positive and the increments due to higher temperature are negative this behavior is reversed in such elements as tungsten which has a negative initial level and positive temperature increments up to a temperature of about 1,400 Kelvin Above This temperature there is a downward Trend uh this downward portion of the curve linear as usual is the second segment at the present stage of the theoretical development it appears probable that a general rule is involved here that is the second segment of each curve the multi-unit segment is directed toward more negative values irrespective of the direction of the first single unit segment another thermal El electric effect is the conduction of heat this is a process that is more important from a practical standpoint than those effects that were considered earlier and it has therefore been uh given more atten mention in the present day early stage of the development of the theory of the universe of motion although the examination of the subject was a somewhat incident was a somewhat incidental feature of the review of electronic of electric current phenomena undertaken in preparation for the new edition of this work it has produced a fairly complete picture of the heat conductivity of the principal class of conducting Metals together with a general idea of the manner in which other elements deviate from the general pattern it was possible to achieve these results in the limited time available because as it turned out the metallic conduction of heat is not a complex process involving difficult Concepts such as photons orbitals relaxation processes electron scattering and so on as seen by conventional physics but a very simple process capable of being defined by equally simple mathematics closely related to the ma mathematical relations governing purely mechanical processes in the first situation discussed in this chapter that in which two previously isolated conductors of different composition are bought brought into contact the electron energies in the two conductors are essentially unequal as brought out there the contact results in the establishment of an equilibrium between a larger number of less energetic electrons in one conductor and a smaller number of more energetic electrons in the other such an equilibrium cannot be established uh sorry such an equilibrium cannot be established between two sections of a homogeneous conductor because in this case there is no influence that requires either the individual electron energy or the electron concentration to take different values in different locations if the environmental conditions are uniform both the energy distribution and the electron concentration attain uniformity throughout the conductor however if one end of a conductor composed of a material such as iron is heated the energy content of the electrons at that location is increased and a force differential differential is generated under the influence of the force gradient some of the hot electrons move toward the cold end of the conductor at that end the newly arrived electrons uh give up heat in the process of reaching a thermal equili equilibrium with the atomic motion and join the concentration of cold electrons previously existing at this location the re resulting higher electron pressure causes a flow of cold electrons back toward the hot end of the conductor none of the characteristic electrical effects are produced in this process because the two oppositely directed electron flows are equal in magnitude and the effects produced by one current are cancelled by those produced by the other the only observable result is a transfer of heat from the hot end of the conductor to the cold end should be noted that no electrostatic potential differences involved in either of these current flows this is one of the obstacles in the way of a simple explanation of heat conduction in the context of conventional physical Theory where electric currents are assumed to result from differences in potential as explained in chapter 9 our finding is that all of the forces causing flow of current in the conductor under consideration that due to the excess energy of the hot electrons that due to the increased concentration of electrons at the cold end and that due to the electric voltage in general are forces of a mechanical type not electrostatic forces if the material of the conductor is a substance such as copper in which the voltage decreases becomes less negative as the temperature Rises the same result is produced in an inverse manner here the effective energy of the electrons at the hot end of the conductor is lower than that of the cold electrons a flow of cold electrons into the hot region therefore takes place these electrons absorb heat from the environment to attain thermal equilib ium with the matter of the conductor the resulting increased concentration of hot electrons is then relieved by a flow of some of these electrons back toward the cold end of the conductor here again the two oppositely directed electron flows produce no net electrical effects the conduction of heat in metals by movement M of electrons is essentially the same process as the convection of heat by movement of gas or liquid molecules in a closed system energetic molecules from a hot region move toward a cold region while a parallel flow carries an equal number of cold molecules back to the hot region there is only one significant difference between the two heat transfer processes because the third molecules I&#x27;m sorry because the fluid molecules are subject to a gravitational effect heat transfer by convection is relatively rapid if it is assisted by a thermally caused difference in density whereas it is much slower if the diffusion of the hot molecules operates against the gravitational force the quantitative measure of the ability of the electron movement to conduct heat is known as the thermal conductivity its magnitude is determined primarily perhaps entirely by the effective specific heat and the temperature coefficient of resistivity both of which are inversely related to the conductivity there is a possibility that it may also be affected to a minor degree by some other influences not yet identified but in any event all of the modifying influences other than the specific heat are independent of the temperature within the range of accuracy of the measurements of the thermal conductivity and they can be combined into one constant value for each substance the thermal conductivity of the substance is then this constant divided by the effective specific heat so the equation is thermal conductivity equal K Over C * P okay well I can&#x27;t quite uh expound on that uh equation at this point um I&#x27;m trying to even figure out what the C is is that the speed of light a coefficient of resistivity and the uh p is the pressure so I&#x27;m sorry my understanding of thermoelectric properties is quite poor and I will try to figure this out but in the meantime thanks for tuning in today and we&#x27;ll start up tomorrow at the same spot have a great</p>
