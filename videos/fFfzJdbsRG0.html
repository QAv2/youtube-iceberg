            <p>Jwey B. Larsen wrote one of the boldest manifestos in physics. The universe is nothing but motion. Not motion of things, but motion itself as substance. In his reciprocal system, photons are oscillations.</p>
<p>Matter is rotational motion. Gravity and cosmic expansion are two sides of the same progression. What aged well is his motion first ontology and his view of time as a relation not a river. Where he stumbled was precision. RS couldn&#x27;t match the predictive power of GR QED or the standard model.</p>
<p>Motion theory keeps his insight but anchors it in math that works using coherence and sync to explain structure, time, and cosmology. The legacy is clear. Nothing but motion, but tested with numbers, not just words. For more info, watch the complete</p>
