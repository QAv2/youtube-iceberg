            <p>mm-hmm all right everyone hello how are you doing uh welcome to my channel I&#x27;m Thomas and I do videos on educational matters uh right now we&#x27;re beginning our survey of the reciprocal system of theory of Dewey B Larson and also the reciprocal system two um developed by Bruce Perrette kvk nehru and others and um we were talking about um Larson&#x27;s biography last time and we kind of had uh stopped off about the time that Larson was writing his first uh his first books he kind of turned the corner um came up with his epiphanies around 1930 but it took him many many many years to work it out uh what he called the uh inductive phase so he had his inductive phase uh that went on for about 20 years until about 1950 and then um he kind of turned the cup the corner he when he arrived at the concept of the universe of motion when he recognized that time and space uh had a reciprocal relationship in motion and that the Universe was made out of motion uh as opposed to matter or energy uh as some of the earlier paradigms had claimed and I said the inductive so this was the inductive phase you know uh and then since then he&#x27;s been working on the deductive phase um and he said the inductive phase was the hard work the deductive phase it&#x27;s just you you got your postulates and you work down toward the consequences and you know with the reciprocal system that is some of the uh you know it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a system so you have these postulates you start out with the postulates and you you basically say well if this then that then this then that um and you get these entities that come out of the system and you they don&#x27;t come out with labels so you have to figure out what this is what this thing is uh that has these theoretical qualities to it um does it have a counterpart in Legacy science so you know when something comes out of the system you know you&#x27;re like what is this thing well it possibly it&#x27;s a new thing that has never been discovered before but chances are it&#x27;s probably something that has already been um you know discovered and work through by Legacy science already but what is what what label does it have you know is this and you know this is a photon or this is an atom this is an electron you know this is um you know a white dwarf star or whatever whatever it is you know you put the Machinery of the original postulates of the system into your kind of theoretical um you know um Machinery however you turn over your lot your system of logic and uh you know you oh you get these things that pop out and you have to be able to kind of uh label them figure out you know what is the correspondence with the um Legacy system but you have an advantage because the Legacy system uh has these things in it but it doesn&#x27;t really have a conceptual view of all of them it doesn&#x27;t really know how one&#x27;s related to the other or what they are in in concept so for example like the electron you know uh they think that the electron the Legacy science thinks that the electron is is revolving around the nucleus of an of all the atoms and that there&#x27;s a certain amount of them and that they can be shared with other atoms and that&#x27;s how you Bond and um but Larson uh you know is dealing with just time and space the um you know where the um in Legacy science time and space uh is the setting of the universe the universe is in space and it&#x27;s moving through time but in Larson&#x27;s system the uh space and time are the contents of the universe everything is made out of space or time and or time and so with the electron he eventually came up with the idea that the you that the electron is nothing more than a rotating unit of space and then when that rotating unit of space is moving through time time is um is matter matter is made out of time so the electric current is the electron the rotating unit of space moving through time which is just the reciprocal of a of an atom of time moving through space so anyway um we&#x27;ll get into that a lot more um uh it it it changes the whole game because for Larson the electron is uh on an uncharged particle um that can take a charge you can have a Charged electron but you also have an um uncharged electron which I think that Legacy science would say that that is like um a positive charge but Larson&#x27;s saying that it&#x27;s uncharged so anyway so you know the main uh thing that he was working on that caused his breakthrough was his inter-atomic distance so he was trying to measure how far apart uh you know the nuclei or the atoms because Larson eventually came up with the idea that there is no nucleus an atom does not have a nucleus that was the name of his first book the case against the nuclear atom and that book doesn&#x27;t necessarily present his uh his new uh reciprocal system of the universe of motion but uh he really uh more looked at it kind of historically that there was a a case against the nuclear atom uh that had developed historically from other scientists but uh the inter-atomic distance was basically the the distance between atoms that were packed together um you know like the same atom uh you know so if you have a a lattice of a bunch of different uh carbon atoms you know how far apart are they they are they always uh pack in us in a in a closest packing uh how far apart are they and so you have carbon atoms packed together and then you have nitrogen atoms packed together and you have oxygen atoms packed together um they all have different distances from each other uh when they are packed together and what what Express what mathematical expression are you going to use to describe uh to accurately describe that distance there is uh so he he was working for a very long time trying to figure this out how uh what is the expression for the inter-atomic distance so that so what he would be doing is he&#x27;d be looking at the scientific tables you know of the inter-atomic distance you know okay for this atom it&#x27;s three angstroms and for this atom it&#x27;s four angstroms for this atom is 3.5 angstroms now what is it about these atoms that makes that difference okay So eventually he came to the idea that uh this expression that I had found for the inter-atomic distance was the intra integral meaning the um you know calc the integral of calculus uh of a reciprocal relation so once you&#x27;ve figured out this reciprocal relation between space and time he said this would open the door to the solution of at least half a dozen problems of long-standing in the physical sciences it was like rolling up a curtain and you&#x27;ve got a bunch of answers right in front of you the speed of light if it&#x27;s a reciprocal relation the light has to go at unit speed the speed of light and that&#x27;s a feature of Larson&#x27;s system where you know if you go to Einstein Einstein is really saying that the speed of light is the maximum speed of the universe nothing can go beyond the speed of light Larson on the contrary says that the speed of light is actually the midpoint of the universe and so half the universe is moving faster than the speed of light and half of it is moving slower than the speed of light we are accustomed to being in that universe that&#x27;s moving slower than the speed of light that would be what he calls the material sector but then there is another half of the universe which you would recall call The Cosmic sector where everything is moving faster than the speed of light and a lot of that has to do with like mental phenomena um and uh then he eventually he gets the life unit out of a combination of those two things a combination uh at the right proportions between a material uh a material uh atom or material entity and a cosmic entity so Larson through that whole thing opens up a whole nother can of worms for us the study of mental phenomena as being uh part of the cosmic universe but the thing is that the cosmic universe and the material Universe are identical except that they are have space and time reversed and therefore whatever it is that&#x27;s in the material universe is also in the cosmic universe so you can figure out even though we don&#x27;t have any type of direct access to the cosmic Universe we can figure out what&#x27;s in it just because we know what&#x27;s in the material universe anyway so he goes back it was like rolling up a curtain you&#x27;ve got a bunch of answers right there the speed of light uh has to go at unit speed and then you have also the space time progression um which you know I&#x27;m thinking like the expanding Universe so-called um that all um the Hubble constant uh everything is moving away from each other the further away they are the faster they&#x27;re moving away from each other so that&#x27;s the explanation of the recession of the galaxies that&#x27;s actually the progression of time or I&#x27;m sorry the progression of space the progression of time we know uh from in the material sector you know time is always getting later and later and later and later well there is also a progression of space things are getting further and further and further apart in space okay because of the reciprocal relation everything that is a quality of space is also equality of time and vice versa so what we know about space is that it&#x27;s three-dimensional or multi-dimensional and um so time is also uh three-dimensional or you know with some of the more modern geometries you might say more than three or whatever but um and then what we know about time is that it&#x27;s progressing it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later well that also exists in space meaning that the space time grad the recession of the galaxies everything is getting further and further and further apart and this is a scalar Mo these are scalar motion time progresses in a scalar manner it doesn&#x27;t progress in a specific Direction um or it progresses in all directions but it&#x27;s always getting later and later and later it&#x27;s a magnitude but it has no Direction um that&#x27;s a definition of scalar motion and scalar motion is the kind of motion that Larson is referring to when he&#x27;s talking about his Universe of motion now there can be vectorial motions which are motions in a specific Direction but that is something that is a subset of the scalar motion So within one dimension of a scalar motion there are three dimensions of vectorial motions and there are three dimensions of scalar motions so there are you know three different sets of kind of XYZ coordinates within uh the whole system okay so then he says his postulates followed almost immediately after getting the idea of the uh reciprocal relation um and so then he was really able to to make strides and start writing and so he really he&#x27;s he started putting together this structure of the physical universe and you know I&#x27;ve looked at a it came out in I think 1959 it&#x27;s uh it&#x27;s a detective story just to to look at it you know um it it again he put it together for his own purposes to you know keep track of where he was going so you know there&#x27;s all kinds of hip writing and his own handwriting uh in the margins and there&#x27;s some chapters that are missing uh some chapters that are incomplete um and uh some you know some stuff that where he&#x27;s got the whole page crossed out you know um and so you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s difficult to to get into that structure of the physical Universe he eventually rewrote the whole thing in the 80s with his uh structure of the physical Universe um divided into the three books which are the books that three of the books that we&#x27;ll be going over closely here uh pretty soon the first one nothing about motion second one basic properties of matter which is on chemistry and the third one is the universe of motion on astronomy um so those those were kind of revisions uh after 30 more years of um those that original structure of the physical universe that came out in 1959 um but you know he started publishing things that&#x27;s the main idea and um he published them himself and he sent them out all over the place it sounds like he pretty much sent copies everywhere to every University every Professor everyone that he could think of uh to send them out and um and as well as you know articles to journals and so on and he said sometimes it seemed to me um that I got uh got it back before I sent it out you know I got my rejection letters back before I even sent them out um he said the attention I got was mostly from the students I had quite a bit of correspondence with students and initially most of the lectures I gave were sponsored by some group of students at one University or another usually over the opposition of the faculty okay so you know again uh you&#x27;ve got this Paradigm entrenched Paradigm of these people who have invested their their lives and their reputations their careers on this certain Paradigm and here comes this guy coming out of nowhere with this different Paradigm they&#x27;re not willing to even look at it okay their their orientation is to be opposed to it before they even see what it is uh and you know you&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve heard it from scientific scientist friends of mine I don&#x27;t have time to look at every you know um what&#x27;s the word um Jack of all trades or every you know a guy in his basement doing research I just don&#x27;t have time to look at all that and they don&#x27;t because they&#x27;re kept busy you know with their little pigeonhole of of territory that they have so they don&#x27;t have time to look at uh new theories that come in but this the students uh were very interested and eventually he found a couple of professors that liked some of his work at the Queen Mary College in England electrical engineers and so he got a little bit of um a little bit of a foothold there um and uh you know had a little bit of Correspondence going with those people there um but really um like I said I&#x27;ve been studying Larson since that you know just after I got my PhD um and for that was 20 over 20 years ago I&#x27;ve never ever met another person who&#x27;s ever heard of him before uh that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t those people I&#x27;ve just never met one uh because there definitely are some people who understand Larson I&#x27;m not I&#x27;m not the only person that understands I don&#x27;t even claim to understand Larson I think my comprehension of Larson&#x27;s theory is you know 60 to 80 percent uh there&#x27;s uh you know maybe a few people who are living that understand it better than me um but I feel like even if you understand it five percent uh it can make a big difference because uh it just presents a new paradigm um just the whole concept of the universe of motion that um and now this is more of a globe Earth kind of thing but you can just recognize that all of the when you get down to a complete Stillness in your life that Stillness is emotion okay so that&#x27;s um kind of where I leave it right now we will continue on uh next time</p>
