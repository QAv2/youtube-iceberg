            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>i&#x27;m gonna go over to mark and i will spotlight mark for everyone okay go for it sir okay so um we&#x27;re actually gonna try some sort of spinning superconductor experiment over here and if i can get the scale to run we&#x27;ll actually be able to see if there&#x27;s anything going on um i got some liquid nitrogen here at the lab so start off with just a simple demonstration of superconductors in here we have a small ycbo superconductor and many of you have probably seen this uh this presentation before let me give a love or something it&#x27;s it&#x27;s kind of cold bounce got almost gonna burn before that&#x27;s better than nothing and the the superconductor over here the ycbo which is type 2 actually got quantumly locked to the magnets and uh it&#x27;s kind of floating around not doing that great of a job because of the the foam is locking in place um well there you can see it floating uh the next thing we have here which is basically um magnets with opposing magnetic fields and mark i should mention that we can&#x27;t hear you i&#x27;m not sure what might be going on there okay is that better can you hear me now okay perfect perfect okay um just hold on one second we&#x27;re still we&#x27;re still getting there with the uh the liquid nitrogen this is going to take a couple of minutes it&#x27;s a pretty large disk i have it inside of like a foam cup here and i&#x27;m not sure if you heard this earlier but the magnetic field lines uh in order to hold this disc in place are we got um north in and then south and it&#x27;s basically alternating this is a design that uh jeremiah pop uh suggested the other night um for a scale measurement i actually have a nasa huntsville uh mug that i got when i was down there and i&#x27;m gonna try sharing screen and getting the weight measurement of that uh mug on the screen i had it up a moment ago but it was we were running into technical difficulties when the measurement wouldn&#x27;t really change much longer light here it is tim if you could unmute everyone or let people unmute that will be helpful because like if anyone has any questions i can answer them in real time while the superconductor okay yeah so i i just enabled it to allow people to unmute themselves and uh so it look let me see it looks like remy had some questions and i guess guys just try to oh no remy go for it sir go for it mark how you doing mark hey i&#x27;m i&#x27;m okay yeah we lost your sound just as you got out of the chair to do the second video you lost all your description of what you were doing can you run it back what we were doing before is just giving you a um that was a uh proof of concept of the uh the meissner effect and it we had the super conductor running along a little track so it gets locked in yeah not that one the second we saw this one you had sound up to the oh okay this is so great yeah the second one we lost all description of what you were doing oh okay so i&#x27;m i&#x27;m still pulling off a superconductor over here we&#x27;re trying some sort of replication of the uh spinning disc experiment so it&#x27;s like a 3d printed wheel with six bar magnets um a lot uh positioned in inside of it or is there just one for now uh there&#x27;s six bar magnets printed inside of it the bar magnets are polaroids axially and it&#x27;s attached to a motor base over here this thing can spin um pretty fast faster than i would want it to spin the uh the mug over here is hooked up to a scale that is actually connected with via usb back to the laptop and i&#x27;m going to try to do a share screen so i can give you the live data from my laptop let me see there we go share screen okay so you can see um now you should be able to see both the experiment going on and the uh sample measurement now i was having trouble before that the uh that it wouldn&#x27;t zero like it seems to be frozen and it seems like it&#x27;s doing it again this is an issue i was having earlier microphone there we go now it&#x27;s moving yeah it&#x27;s moving a little bit now let&#x27;s see if i nope nope i got nothing it like works for a couple of seconds and then it stops working anyways i don&#x27;t want to keep you guys waiting too long i&#x27;ll just power it up and we&#x27;ll see what happens and mark are you going to be okay spinning that i don&#x27;t want that nitrogen to fly out and get you i&#x27;m not worried about the nitrogen i&#x27;m worried about the magnets actually with them too i mean uh yeah these this  can really hurt me the magnets can hurt me nothing not the liquid nitrogen oops okay it needs a little bit of a startup i know i want to make hey we mark can you make your uh thing bigger and make that um any way to make that four spherometer just a small window and then that&#x27;s on tim it&#x27;s not on me uh the four colometer&#x27;s not working it&#x27;s not changing at all i could put some smoke over it see if there&#x27;s any uh any upward smoke yeah i&#x27;m trying but oh there we go unswapped screens there we go so mark if the force ometer isn&#x27;t working why don&#x27;t i just unsk one share screen then yeah stop stop i got it no i got it working tim just it&#x27;s fine orthometer is not working at all it&#x27;s it&#x27;s showing the exact same number even when i lift the uh yeah so it&#x27;s obviously not working we&#x27;ll have to get something else um i&#x27;m curious what tony thinks of this uh this replication is tony still there i&#x27;m here being quiet i i i think the superconductor&#x27;s too small to see an effect one thing that&#x27;s kind of interesting is uh we got the superconductor locked into the fields and uh every time you turn it like it you see when i get the uh the magnets over 60 degrees to the next polarization point the super connector wants to float up yeah it&#x27;s acting like a magnet because it&#x27;s pinned to flux in it right so i wonder what happened if i got if i got all the all the magnets spinning and held the super connector in place one second oh this is cold you get a better glove get the chemical gloves yeah we have them for a reason people were taking more peop using more ppe for you know corona than this man you don&#x27;t have a face mask nothing uh it feels really weird well the suit detector is acting like a magnet so every time it magnet filled you you should feel it like going up and down as it feels changing yeah that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s doing pretty strong it traps the field pretty well like i said i mapped the field after trapping it once and it&#x27;s pretty strong oh it&#x27;s vibrating pretty nicely you&#x27;re doing something a little differently uh sounds like those uh the female massage toes you really get up there with the uh the frequency as as the rpm rises wow it&#x27;s a very interesting toy to play with uh i think the um the scale measurement might be broken so um maybe later in the second half of the presentation if i get that fixed by then i&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll do a rerun on it or just try a new uh scale uh because i do have i do have a backup unit so the mug above the the hanging mug was just to measure if there was a shielding effect or a gravity loss above it yes yeah because that that&#x27;s how uh parkland claimed there was uh weight loss it was measured above it um so i had the mug over there but the uh the scale is is not working correctly right now and uh you know mark remy actually and remy put this in chat he was wondering if you could improvise a balance with a stick and a light weight um so there was nothing in the mug though too there was nothing in the mug no just to be ceramic yeah we thought of this stuff with rotating small discs we never saw anything i mean i i could uh i could figure something out it&#x27;s going to take at least a half an hour so um yeah well we could try it later during open session um yeah yeah we could try it again during open session and by the way i&#x27;m wearing the glasses again not for the liquid nitrogen this thing is 3d printed and at the speed that&#x27;s rotating i&#x27;ve seen things fly off it that can possibly even like break skin so it&#x27;s pretty uh yeah rotating large masses is dangerous especially when they&#x27;re cold yes more brittle so yeah yes well um should we do do you want to go to um while you&#x27;re working on this then and mark thank you if anyone has any suggestions or questions about the setup i would love to hear them right now this way we can uh work on it uh okay yeah let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do that then let&#x27;s do that um so here i&#x27;m gonna remove spotlight let&#x27;s do q a then um and anybody who has questions go go for it suggestions yeah mark i&#x27;ll i want to start with saying that we definitely need to work on getting a hood uh vent a vented hood um to work in with like a face shield um over the hood oh that one right here yeah we should build one right in that corner um i&#x27;m gonna make a trip uh plan to come down there at some point that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a great idea i could put that on the lab to-do list also um while you&#x27;re down here we need a uh there&#x27;s like a faucet connection behind the cnc machine that needs to get hooked up the the nitrogen tends to go to the floor because it&#x27;s cold so uh so um yeah i have it so just be careful that if your room&#x27;s closed too much you can fill up with nitrogen and uh you suffocate but it does tend to go to the floor instead of up because it&#x27;s cold i think nitrogen may be actually heavier than air too once it goes down we never had a problem suffocating or anything in a room like like you have but you you just have to be aware that you can right we have an oxygen sensor to uh measure the oxygen levels in the room uh we check that out every once in a while um i do like to air out the room a lot and um i&#x27;m particularly sensitive to very high levels of co to high levels of co2 so um but i think this is different because this would be suffocation lack of oxygen yeah just be careful [Music] okay yeah does that does anybody else have questions for mark i have a question yeah go for it what did you expect to see from the meter and is it something that you did before and no no this is the first time i did it i was literally uh epoxying the magnets onto this disc uh at the beginning of the session um uh no it&#x27;s not something we i&#x27;ve actually tried before and we try live experiments here for the first time everyone can see the results but uh we were hoping to see weight loss i wasn&#x27;t expecting to see weight loss i would have been shocked if i saw weight loss and uh yeah that&#x27;s pretty much it one note though is that the superconductor disc over here is not very well built i think it was like a homemade project or something um it&#x27;s covered in like tape uh here&#x27;s a second one what i got from them it&#x27;s covered in this like tape electric tape kind of material and when i opened that up i saw it was full of cracks so it&#x27;s not a single domain there&#x27;s a lot of domains in there i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s good or bad for this experiment tony what was the disc made by nasa single domain or multiple domains of the large ones we made we never made one that wasn&#x27;t uh single layered so we didn&#x27;t do a milk texture on this but i did some small ones that were melt texture that were quite well we also acquired a about a four inch disc from oak ridge that was melt textured and uh it was very very good superconductor but but exposing it to the liquid nitrogen and the moisture that it collected it just deteriorated over time fell apart okay mark another thing i think we should do is get a data acquisition device and um you know find a way to actively measure the temperature of our superconductor disk with like a laser uh um you know or or some other device that i can yeah we have and put it into a computer and we can take we can i&#x27;ll build a labview program and we can actually take live data on both the weight loss and um the temperature and all these other factors that would be a great idea um if we&#x27;re getting weight loss to definitely take all those measurements um yeah we&#x27;re just messing around until we we get something then what&#x27;s wrong yeah we want to see a result first before we start you know going crazy for every single last bit of data um you want to see that there&#x27;s something there before you start looking at every single leaf of the tree you know but not used frequency around three megahertz and that seems to be a magic number for this ybco we did some experiments that actually showed that a six megahertz radiate cosmic radiation going through the superconductor actually turned into three megahertz radiation so spinning this uh this slow may not ever see an effect from it you need something that&#x27;s going to give you what kind of rpm would be looking for go figure out figure out what three megahertz would be with your magnets passing by it it&#x27;d be pretty fast oh okay so that would be uh six times the oh oh my god yeah well what if you could put a three megahertz signal on it right maybe you don&#x27;t necessarily need to in fact i i&#x27;ve i&#x27;ve been seeing stuff in chat where they&#x27;re saying uh and i think paul klopp might have suggested this himself maybe rotation isn&#x27;t required at all um maybe just try putting a three megahertz signal on it and see if that does anything i would agree with that i i don&#x27;t think rotation is that important it&#x27;s the the flux pinning the uh two conducting junctions and the frequency that you put on are probably three important things and oh well one thing that i i remember that popcorn said that it uh the effect was greatest as it was slowing down or something like that between three and 2000 rpm i could agree with that because some changes tend to give you effects you don&#x27;t see in a steady state um that&#x27;s pretty interesting yeah um so another experiment i wanted to try was to have the superconductor being held in place while just the magnets that are that it&#x27;s flux pin to are spinning um like we saw before just if we can get that weight measurement in as well um and see if there&#x27;s any weight loss the magnet fields when they&#x27;re locked into the superconnector in fact the magnetic fields are locked into a magnet even though we rotate them the fields in the in the superconductor or the field of magnet won&#x27;t rotate it&#x27;s the field outside it that rotates right okay well so let me go to michael let me get michael has a question and then after that let&#x27;s go to ken griggs our next guest but let me go to michael first for a question okay i&#x27;m waiting for him to come he&#x27;s a mad scientist what&#x27;s up michael oh not too much so first question maybe you need one of those 50 000 doers um the one i got on amazon for for buck 99 is working just fine okay so my one one question i have is uh maybe if you could uh design a kind of like a thermos jar which had a cold finger you know when i used to work on these they used them a lot in their detective world and basically you had this fancy doer and had a a cold finger a piece of metal non-uh ferromagnetic metal that would sit so you fill up the you fill it up on the side and then this thing was you would be able to like wrap it in there and you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about filling it with the liquid nitrogen and the nitrogen throat being thrown around because it&#x27;s it&#x27;s contained in this this cavity and the the metal plug that the that the superconductor is in thermal contact with it um we used to use a piece of indium metal to stick it to it and and and that way you could rotate it around and you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it and then the other idea i thought you might consider is instead of having a cup you have something that has a low uh uh low um gravity compared to the ambient environment like a balloon for example a a balloon like a mylar balloon or something that basically it&#x27;s sitting there it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of change in mass for it to move that big hunk of of uh ceramic that you&#x27;re hanging over there it&#x27;s got a lot of mass in it and it if there is any effect there you won&#x27;t see it um the issue with a mylar balloon is uh you&#x27;re looking at airflows at that point very heavily affected by air flow well it depends on how far away it is i imagine yeah well you know also there do you think that could work the other way too because you&#x27;ve got more mass there so if you have a gravity effect it has more to effect as opposed to mild artwork where it&#x27;s so lightweight that maybe it&#x27;s reducing the gravity but you know what i mean right well maybe my point is maybe something a a different like a a metal balloon or something you know like a sphere a hollow sphere or something like that just my idea is that you have too much gas there you have a little tiny superconductor puck and you got this big mass that you&#x27;re trying to move make the the the mass relatively the same uh the same magnitude and then i think you can see the effect i mean if if if it is a gravity shielding effect you&#x27;d want the mass and you&#x27;re only looking at like one percent uh gravity weight loss uh or gravity shielding you&#x27;d want your sample to be as heavy as possible so that you can see that you know get better resolution on it um obviously it&#x27;s just an idea yeah something to something to try um i&#x27;m guessing okay well so let&#x27;s go let me see i think william schramm had a question so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s go to william and then after that we will go to ken griggs oh wait i guess i just had uh a suggestion maybe we get cryo mac to sponsor this experiment so they can actually uh like put a cryo cooler in there instead of liquid nitrogen so you uh instead of asphyxiating yourself you might just try putting a refrigeration unit there i don&#x27;t know this this thing weighs a couple of ounces how heavy is the refrigeration unit it&#x27;s quite heavy but nevertheless i guess there&#x27;s your answer i think that you know you could operate uh that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another core skill oh you gotta wait uh light and small so let&#x27;s let&#x27;s do this then um let&#x27;s go to let me let me put it back on for so first of all everybody let&#x27;s give mark an enormous hand for his demo so far mark that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an awesome demo and it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to follow up tony&#x27;s presentation by by talking about that as well um so let me do this i&#x27;m going to mute everybody out really quick um so if possible i would like to get ken griggs in so</p>
