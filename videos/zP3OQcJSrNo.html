            <h2>Transcript</h2>
            <p>[music] Good day and welcome to Reality Check Q&amp;A. I&#x27;m your host Ross Colart. I&#x27;m on the road today, but here to help me from Chicago is my friend and colleague Megan Medic. Good day, Megan. &gt;&gt; Hey, Ross.</p>
<p>So, where in the world are you now? I&#x27;m currently in a hotel on route to interesting parts of the United States where I intend investigating stories on the ground, hoping to cause as much mischief as possible. And then of course, I&#x27;m returning to Los Angeles on the 20th of February for what I hope will be a very interesting conscious life expo conference that&#x27;s being held here for 3 days. Hope to see you there. Well, Ross, that is all very exciting and I can&#x27;t wait to see you there in a couple of days. But I will get to our first question.</p>
<p>This is from some breaking news out of the US. The El Paso airport, it was closed down and the White House said that the closure was tied to Mexican cartel drones. I had a couple viewers reach out to me on X wanting to know your opinion on that breaking news. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, of course, this is huge.</p>
<p>the fact that one of I think the 20th biggest airport in the United States was closed originally for 10 solid days after the defense department apparently decided to use new anti- drone technology. And this is the drop. This is what we&#x27;re told on the sly. It all happened without the Defense Department giving the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, enough time to assess the risks to aircraft traffic, particularly commercial airlines if the Defense Force, as apparently it did, started using high energy lasers to down drones. It&#x27;s quite amazing that this shows, I think, a lack of coordination and collaboration between the Federal Aviation Administration and the Defense Department.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s hugely concerning that, as our uh other host Alli Bradley has revealed in her commentary, she&#x27;s very plugged into border uh control. And she says that neither the local mayor in El Paso or even the local army base at Fort Bliss knew anything about this decision to shut down the airspace for 10 days. [sighs] It does beg a lot of questions. Frankly, Megan, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me because why would you even if it was a drone incursion closed down airspace in a major airport, a major international airport? and and that includes not just commercial traffic, but cargo traffic, um air rescue traffic, police traffic, everything was grounded. It all happened apparently at around about 11:30 at night on the 10th of February.</p>
<p>And originally the closure was for 10 days and then it was stopped within the 24 hours after I think shamefacedly and to some embarrassment the defense department was forced to admit internally that it had shot down a party balloon. Now a lot of this doesn&#x27;t wash with me. How could you not know that this was a party balloon? Maybe it&#x27;s because it was at night. But there&#x27;s pretty good technology these days that allows our defense department particularly to be able to delineate between a a rubber or plastic balloon and something more sinister. There&#x27;s also a big question mark about the claims made by the transportation secretary Sha Duffy who said that this was a response, a targeted response to drone incursions by Mexican cartels across from the Mexican border into Texas.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense because nobody knows anything about these mass drone incursions. Nobody&#x27;s confirming it to me. I&#x27;m hearing categorical denials from people that there were any such massive drone incursions. And I note that even the New York Times is raising an eyebrow suggesting that this doesn&#x27;t quite make sense. In fact, um uh there&#x27;s a lot of anger apparently inside the FAA that the defense department made this decision to mobilize this new high energy laser technology pretty much without telling anyone with adequate warning.</p>
<p>And so I think for good reason the FAA made a decision to close down airspace. I suspect because they wanted to make a point to the defense department that you can&#x27;t just go doing this without clearing it for public safety with the relevant body, the Federal Aviation Administration. And I suspect it&#x27;s a bit of a power flex from the FAA. And good on them. There&#x27;s a broader issue here though, as we&#x27;ve been going on about for years now on reality check.</p>
<p>There is clearly a problem with unidentified objects. We&#x27;re not saying they&#x27;re aliens, little green men, or even enemy adversary drones. What we&#x27;re saying is that there is definitely a problem that the United States defense, intelligence, and civilian aviation communities are not dealing with adequately to respond to unidentified aerial systems, UAS&#x27;s, over controlled airspace, be they military or civilian. And this is a lesson for the Defense Department and the FAA to get their acts together and get their story straight. I mean, to close off a near 10m radius and warn of potential deadly force for unauthorized aircraft violations, that&#x27;s pretty heavy duty.</p>
<p>And you really shouldn&#x27;t be making decisions like that without first going to all of the different agencies, especially the FAA that&#x27;s responsible for civilian air traffic, and make sure that they&#x27;re happy that you&#x27;re going to be deploying high energy lasers. So, I think there&#x27;s a bit of embarrassment about this and I think there&#x27;s going to have to be further explanation as to why the transportation secretary Sha Duffy claimed that this sudden restriction was due to a cartel drone incursion that supposedly breached US airspace that nobody knows anything about. So, Megan, have you ever had your data stolen? Because I have, and it scares the living daylights out of me. No, I have not, Ross. And I feel very lucky that that hasn&#x27;t happened because it&#x27;s such a scary world out there right now.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Well, it is. And I actually had the opportunity a few years ago to talk to a criminal reformed so-called who told me how easy it was to steal your data. And it&#x27;s why I have long used ExpressVPN, a product I&#x27;m very happy to endorse. He used what&#x27;s called a packet sniffer, sitting in an airport lounge, and showed me how all the businessmen around me were logging into their bank accounts, putting in their credit card numbers, writing confidential emails to their work colleagues, and every single keystroke was being recorded by the software that he was using. And the only way of protecting against that is by using a VPN.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re suggesting you consider ExpressVPN. One of the easiest ways for data brokers to track you is through your devices unique IP address, which also reveals information about your location. And with ExpressVPN, your IP address can actually be hidden. This makes it much more difficult for those data broker scumbags to monitor, track, and monetize your data. The good thing about ExpressVPN is it&#x27;s 12 cents a day.</p>
<p>It works on all of your devices, your phone, your laptop, your tablet. One button to turn it on and you can forget about it. It also has an optional dedicated IP service engineered with innovative zero knowledge design. Not even ExpressVPN can trace an IP address back to the source. And in the US only, there are select plans that include Identity Defender, a new suite of tools to get your data removed from data brokers, alert you when your data appears on the dark web, and even ensure you against data theft for up to $1 million.</p>
<p>So, Megan, a call to action. Secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com/ros. That&#x27;s exvvpn.com/ros to find out how you can get up to four extra months. That&#x27;s expressvpn.com/ros. &gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, thank you.</p>
<p>Here is our next question. This is coming from X. We have anomalous user squared. All right, here&#x27;s a big one I&#x27;ve been asking NASA for weeks and really needs to be talked about. How will NASA do these return to the moon missions while remaining complicent and UAP secrecy? It&#x27;s outright ridiculous that we would return without acknowledging the massive elephant in the room that is UAP disclosure.</p>
<p>It seems like they&#x27;ll do this historic mission after the footage to hide any possible anomalies and say see no evidence of extraterrestrial life and try to bottle it back up for another 50 years. I feel like a character in don&#x27;t look up big fan. Love y&#x27;all. I think this is a response to the two shows that we&#x27;ve put to wear now by Manley Derek Shani who&#x27;s a physicist astrophysicist who&#x27;s basically come on reality check to raise I think genuine scientific questions about what appear to be anomalous potentially artificial structures on the moon now and I have been very careful to say we&#x27;re not saying categorically that these are artificial articial structures built by some intelligence. I don&#x27;t know what they are.</p>
<p>Neither does Manoly. What we&#x27;re doing is raising legitimate questions. So when our correspondent here, anomalous user asks, you know, how can we return to the moon while remaining complicit in UAP secrecy, NASA? Well, we don&#x27;t know for sure that they are. What we are doing on reality check is we are asking NASA for answers. We&#x27;ve promised you that we&#x27;re going to go to the new administrator and we&#x27;re going to ask him to explain these anomalies that have been pointed out not just by Dr.</p>
<p>Derek Shai, but by a host of other people over the years going back to Ken Johnson and Richard Hogan. It&#x27;s too easy to dismiss this stuff with a bit of a tit and a giggle and basically say people are just seeing things that aren&#x27;t there, that this is paridolia. I don&#x27;t think many people at all think after seeing our shows in the last few weeks that this is just paridolia that people are confusing natural objects with mundane reasons for their existence for something artificial. Um I do think NASA needs to explain why there is blurring on images and indeed I&#x27;ve been flooded with more examples since we did these stories that I&#x27;ll probably be bringing you to you in a new show. Um, this seems to have touched a nerve, this story.</p>
<p>I think there is a wisdom of the crowd here. People can smell when they smell it. And I do think there&#x27;s here. I I don&#x27;t think NASA over the years has provided an adequate, if any, answer for these alleged anomalies. And it&#x27;s time they did.</p>
<p>And I think if we are going to be sending moon missions, we should indeed be briefing the public about what&#x27;s up there. I do have a suspicion that NASA has some interesting answers to provide on this issue and believe me we will be pushing for them. &gt;&gt; Okay Ross, let&#x27;s move to our next question. This is also on the moon from Clint in an email. Hello guys, thanks for the work you do.</p>
<p>I would like to ask Ross&#x27; opinion on a prediction of mine. I&#x27;m taking an educated guess that during the next lot of NASA missions to the moon, there will be a contact event taking place. Whether it is a peaceful or aggressive encounter is up for debate. Hopefully peaceful, but I would like to know your thoughts on this hypothetical scenario. All the best from Clint in Adelaide.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay. Ballroom dance 463. Will there be a contact event on the moon? Well, frankly, your guess is as good as mine. The interesting thing is if you believe the astronauts like Edgar Mitchell and others who&#x27;ve spoken privately to certain people, I do believe the astronauts especially on the Apollo mission believe that they were surveiled not only on the lunar surface but during the lunar module detachment and reconnection to the command module and the voyages out from Earth and back to Earth. And my source for this is a man I call uh anonymously the spaceman who was a close personal friend of Edgar Mitchell.</p>
<p>I quote him in my book and I&#x27;ve extensively interviewed him where he&#x27;s told me how Edgar Mitchell admitted that he&#x27;d never admitted to any kind of extraterrestrial engagement during his lifetime. But he admitted privately to my friend that he was told never to talk about what they saw on the moon. and he said they saw blue lights that appeared to be shaped like craft on the approach in the lunar module. Edgar Mitchell said that he flew over what appeared to be a tall towerlike structured object that when he finally got out of the lunar module and walked on the lunar surface and looked back in that direction, it wasn&#x27;t there anymore. So I do think there are interesting questions to be raised about potential lunar missions coming across something that we don&#x27;t know about.</p>
<p>I think I think it&#x27;s very interesting by the way that Elon Musk has just done a huge climb down from deciding to go to Mars in the short term and he&#x27;s now talking only about a moon mission. Why has the moon suddenly become a point of interest, a point of direction for Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX? This has been a guy who&#x27;s been talking for years about the imperative of getting to Mars. Now he&#x27;s talking about going to the moon. It&#x27;s quite a significant backflip by Musk and I&#x27;d love to know the rationale for why he&#x27;s made that decision. I think he said that it&#x27;s going to take a lot longer than expected to be prepared for a Mars mission.</p>
<p>Or maybe Mr. Musk knows something we don&#x27;t. &gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, you know I had to pick this one because I am from Vegas. This is Gambit Peggy on X. Ross, do you think the Vegas aliens from a few years back was a real encounter? &gt;&gt; Okay, this hory thorn of a story.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. Let me get off the top here. I just don&#x27;t know. Like everyone, I watched the videos of a family from I think April 2023 who went public. I think they went on 8 News Now George Naps station in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>They went public with claims that after seeing some kind of a fireball in the sky and a crash and indeed that was recorded on police cameras. Police confirmed the part of the fireball. They actually captured on their body cams and the family actually reported to 911 and you can listen to the 911 call on all of the videos on YouTube that they had seen tall beings in their backyard. Now I don&#x27;t know but there&#x27;s a good mate of mine Scott Rotor who is a very highly qualified forensic investigator who does extremely professional courtroom evidence. Scott Roa, R O D E R, has a company called Evidence Room.</p>
<p>And I know he has a YouTube channel where he&#x27;s done an extremely detailed analysis of the Las Vegas 2023 aliens video. And I know Scott is convinced that it shows something anomalous. He thinks that as the son in the family goes through a door into the backyard, you can actually see what appears to be something stealthy, perhaps concealing itself visually, but you can see some kind of a blurring on the camera. I&#x27;m not so sure. I just don&#x27;t know.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;m I&#x27;m very wary of relying on data that&#x27;s been posted to social media by anyone, which is that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve seen. We&#x27;ve never seen the raw data that presumably the family have got on their phones. And I&#x27;d love to see the family sit down and cooperate. I suspect they probably have done with a TV show. I&#x27;d love to see the raw data.</p>
<p>Get the raw data off the cameras and then have a really good look at that with proper professional gear. But in the short term, I&#x27;d suggest everyone talk to my friend Scott Roa and have a look at his video. What we do know is that I think it was April the 30th, 2023 at around about 10 to midnight, a Las Vegas Metro Police officer&#x27;s body camera video recorded something streaking across the sky. And there were many observers across California, Nevada, and Utah who&#x27;d seen this object and reported it. And according to the 8 News Now investigation that was I think one of the original reports um it matched data from the American Meteor Society which received multiple accounts of this light but a lot of people say that the movement of the object was inconsistent with a meteor.</p>
<p>A drone video did show what appeared to be a circular impact in the dirt suggesting something had crashed near the house. And then about 40 minutes after the sky event, a man called 911 saying, quote, &quot;Something fell in the yard and that there were two very large nonhuman figures there.&quot; He described them as being about 8 to 10 ft tall with big shiny eyes and said they were still present when he was on the phone. And look, this is gripping stuff. I mean, I&#x27;ve listened to this. I&#x27;ve heard the same accounts.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I was like enthralled. But how do we make an assessment of this? I know the police turned up and their body cam footage shows them walking around the scene. They asked neighbors. They searched the backyard, but they found no definitive evidence of physical beings or any kind of craft. And the police department in Las Vegas closed the case after a few days without any conclusive explanation.</p>
<p>What we don&#x27;t have, frankly, is any other footage to corroborate it. There&#x27;s no other strong witnesses who can corroborate what the family say they saw in the backyard. And the police body cams certainly don&#x27;t show the figures in question. You can actually hear the cops as they&#x27;re talking that night. And even they sound like they&#x27;ve got the heeie-jeebies.</p>
<p>It may just be that they picked up on what the family felt. But I&#x27;ve seen videos, especially with the son in the family, and I did find him credible. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s benefited substantially at all from going public other than putting himself up for a great deal of ridicule and attack. So, I I think we should give them a fair go, this family. Um, at some stage, if and when I get to Las Vegas, I wouldn&#x27;t mind talking to the family myself and seeing if they&#x27;re willing to share what they got.</p>
<p>But in the interim, I&#x27;m keeping an open mind. &gt;&gt; All right, here&#x27;s our next question coming to us from email. Hi, Ross. Have any of your sources provided information regarding USOs or potential NHI activity in the Perth Canyon area of Western Australia? I&#x27;m aware that the Australian Navy conducts submarine exercises in that region, but Perth has also experienced a notable number of UAP sightings over the years, including the fireball type events. I personally witnessed one in Rockingham in the 1990s, along with several other unusual sightings.</p>
<p>My mother has also reported seeing a cigar-shaped craft in Albany when she was younger. I appreciate the work you&#x27;re doing. Please keep it up. Regards, Ree. &gt;&gt; Ah, Perth Canyon.</p>
<p>So, this is an interesting one. Okay, first off the top, I will happily declare that I have spoken to Australian Submariners on our Collins class attack submarines. They&#x27;re diesel electric powered submarines. They&#x27;re not nuclear, but they&#x27;ve got a very good reputation for being very, very quiet and very good subs after a lot of money was spent on them and there were huge delays in the project which I I covered. And so I have a lot of contacts in the submarine industry.</p>
<p>And when I started doing a book on UAPs, I actually reached out to some of those contacts and I asked them, &quot;Is there any evidence of Australian submariners hearing [snorts] or recording on sonar unusual objects underwater? and they admitted there were. Now, they&#x27;re good, loyal, patriotic Aussies. They&#x27;re part of the Five Eyes Alliance. And they weren&#x27;t going to tell me where these things were heard, but I do believe that it was more likely to have been up near Bass Strait, which is where we have a lot of oil platforms. And these are very, very heavily monitored by our submarine fleet because they&#x27;re strategically important, and we&#x27;re worried about the Chinese or somebody else coming and trying to attack them.</p>
<p>So, we protect them very very well. But in the course of some of those operations, they have heard anomalous things on sonar and I&#x27;m told they&#x27;ve tracked objects moving at quote hundreds of knots underwater. Now, the Perth Canyon is interesting and it&#x27;s going to become even more interesting because it&#x27;s an area of water. I think it&#x27;s probably 15 20 kilometers off Fremantle and it&#x27;s where for a long time the Australian submarine fleet that&#x27;s normally birthed at HM Sterling, a naval base near Perth. It&#x27;s where those submarines have gone and done training.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s extremely deep water. It goes as deep as 5 kilometers, but there&#x27;s about an average of 2 to 2 1/2k in depth. And you can see why they can&#x27;t find MH370 with canyons like this underwater. Um, I suspect the correspondent who sent me this message or this question knows a bit because there is a lot of talk about Perth Canyon. And the reason why is because a lot of Orcus submarines, a lot of British, US and Australian submarines under the new AUK US Orcus agreement are collaborating and training there.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got a Conqueror class submarine, a British nuclear submarine in Perth at the moment. And where there are nukes, there are UFOs. And without giving the game away, I I am aware of objects being cited at a HMS Sterling and other naval bases around Australia. And I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that we&#x27;re getting increased attendance by American nuclear submarines. The whole HMAS Sterling base is going to be revamped to provide a service center for American and British nuclear submarines to operate in the Pacific without having to go back to the USA to get serviced.</p>
<p>A lot of people in Perth are of course very upset that this makes Perth a target in the event of a nuclear confrontation, but that&#x27;s the price of the Western Five Eyes Alliance and it&#x27;s been that way for many, many years. But I suspect we&#x27;re going to see an increase in UF UFO UAP activity at HMAS Sterling. And I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it happened in the submarine canyon called Perth Canyon. That&#x27;s about 20 km off the coast because this is a big area now for training with submarines that are almost certainly carrying nuclear weapons. And look, as well, Perth is a real hot bed of UFOs.</p>
<p>is there&#x27;s been a long history of UFO sightings. Um there&#x27;s been a recent report of strings of sightings, flashing lights in the sky over Perth, but more in the Midwest way out towards Calguri, often in triangular formations. And there&#x27;s been uh reports, including in the conservative media, public broadcaster, the ABC, of um things happening way way up in the mining areas and the Pilbur and the Kimbley. And there&#x27;s really been no explanation for these objects. People working in those mines have described seeing large black triangular objects moving at ridiculous speeds.</p>
<p>And indeed, I&#x27;ve spoken to fishermen off Xmouth, one of my favorite spots where there is the Harold Halt Naval Communications Station where the US communicates with its nuclear attack submarines. Fishermen off Xmouth have told me they&#x27;ve seen lights in the water, unexplained lights in the water. So yes, that whole area of the West Australian coastline is a very interesting magnet for UAPs, probably because it&#x27;s some of the deepest water in the world, and the Perth Canyon, just 20 km off Fremantle, Perth, is one of them. That&#x27;s an interesting question. I think we&#x27;ll have more on this for you soon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; All right, let&#x27;s move on to a question from Felicity and Grant. Hi, Ross and Megan. We really enjoy your reporting on UAPs and non-human intelligence. We wanted to ask what you think about the idea that some of these beings might not be extraterrestrial, but could have been here on Earth a long time, possibly in the oceans, and that they have evolved much quicker than us. Do you think that that theory has any real credibility, especially with reports of objects going in and out of water and the apparent interest in nuclear sites? Would love to hear your thoughts if you ever cover this angle.</p>
<p>Thanks for the work you do, Felicity and Grant. Okay, the question is, is it possible that some of these beings that we&#x27;re seeing or that people are witnessing are not from other planets, that they&#x27;re cryptoaterrestrial? And my answer to that is absolutely. The whole cryptoterrestrial hypothesis is one that&#x27;s been pushed by a good friend of mine, Dr. Hal Putoff, a very wellrespected UAP investigator and researcher who&#x27;s done an enormous amount of science investigating paranormal phenomena. And Hal&#x27;s written a great paper on cryptoaterrestrials suggesting that the more likely hypothesis is that whatever this nonhuman intelligence is, it&#x27;s possibly living among us.</p>
<p>And just to follow up on our previous answer, it&#x27;s more likely than not that they&#x27;re located in the water. And if you think about water, if you&#x27;re an alien being and you&#x27;re looking for a place to hide, what better place than a few kilometers down in a canyon off the coast of Western Australia or off the coast of Western or Eastern America. It&#x27;s a great place to hide and it&#x27;s a great place to monitor things that are concerning you as a non-human intelligence, such as us crazy apes playing with nuclear weapons. So, I do think that yes, you&#x27;re right. There there are legitimate questions to be raised as to whether or not there is some kind of non-human intelligence that&#x27;s living in our oceans.</p>
<p>And just as recently as a few days ago, I noticed that um Representative um Tim Burchett was uh doors stopped and he talked about how he&#x27;s aware of five or six alleged alien bases operating off or near the coast of the United States. This is really interesting. People like Eric, sorry, people like Tim are being briefed all the time in skiffs. And I do think that there&#x27;s a large degree of evidence that&#x27;s being given in private in the Congress that we&#x27;re not privy to yet in the public that I think points to an awareness that there may indeed be underwater bases. And if you want to know more about this, of course, we did a whole special about this for reality check on NewsNation and you can watch that in our video archive, a huge archival story on us, unidentified submerged objects, including off the coast of California near Catalina Island.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, let&#x27;s move on to our next email. This is from James. Good day, Ross. Hello, Megan. I have a simple question that I have been pondering for quite some time.</p>
<p>Question. Do you think the alien population back on their planet wants disclosure about us? Thank you, James B. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a really interesting question. I&#x27;ll tell you, I can only base my answer on what is essentially speculative claims made by people who purport to be UAP witnesses, people who&#x27;ve had encounters and indeed communication with beings. And what I&#x27;m tracking is an enormous escalation, an enormous frequency increase in the number of people who are telling me that they&#x27;ve been in contact with non-human intelligences that want humanity to know about their existence.</p>
<p>I have a a working hypothesis right now that governments of this planet that are aware of NHI, such as the US, are burying their head in the sand because they&#x27;re frankly incompetent and they don&#x27;t know what to tell the public because they&#x27;re frightened of admitting the extent of what they know and what they&#x27;ve been lying about. It&#x27;s easier for them to keep on lying than it is for them to admit tell the truth. So maybe, just maybe, it&#x27;s the NHI that are trying to force the game. I know the skeptics and the debunkers are suggesting that these drone incursions that were seen right across the continental USA were just misidentified aircraft and commercial or military drones. But I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m not buying it.</p>
<p>And neither of my sources and neither officially, by the way, are people from the Pentagon, the two generals, remember, who went on US CBS 60 Minutes and admitted that they had no explanation for these unidentified objects that were appearing over not just sensitive civilian infrastructure, but also military bases like Eglund Air Force Base and Langley Air Force Base. The two generals that appeared um with Bill Whitaker on CBS 60 Minutes last year frankly admitted that they had no explanation for the so-called drone incursions. And frankly, if the Pentagon doesn&#x27;t have an answer, how can the debunkers and the skeptics so swiftly assert that these were just misidentified aircraft? I&#x27;m not buying it, and I&#x27;m certainly not buying it for continental Europe. And I I&#x27;ve spoken to a lot of people across Europe who are not buying the explanation that these were foreign adversaries like potentially the Russians or the Chinese. Where&#x27;s the evidence? Where&#x27;s the evidence of any downed drone? Let&#x27;s hear that evidence.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s present it. If there is suppression of this evidence, then that&#x27;s completely wrong. The public should be told the truth. But for now, I do think that there is potentially an NHI engaging with this planet, trying to make us aware of its existence, and I think they want us to know about them. &gt;&gt; All right, Ross, here&#x27;s our last one for today.</p>
<p>This is from Elton. Good afternoon, Megan and Ross. I&#x27;m really confused. How come we haven&#x27;t had any good images or video material? At least that is legit and not AI of UAP UFOs considering we live in a day and age where everybody has a smartphone in their pockets and they have camera resolutions better than DSLRs and have 100200 time zoom capabilities. Still, we are left with images from the 1900s that have far less resolution and camera capabilities, but yet still manages to capture UAP UFOs better than smartphones today.</p>
<p>also considering the odds that it so happens to be that the person had a camera to even capture such a phenomenon. Amazing work both of you. Thank you, Elton. &gt;&gt; Okay, look, this is a legitimate question. Why are there so many frustratingly blurry images on video and stills that just don&#x27;t show what people say they saw when they say they saw a UFO? Okay.</p>
<p>Well, one of the first problems is people use their mobile phones. Mobile phones have autofocus built into them. And unless you know what you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re focusing on objects close or near, you&#x27;re not focusing on an object at huge distance. So, you&#x27;re not using a camera that is capable of capturing good imagery, especially imagery moving as fast as these objects move. Some of the best UAP imagery that has been captured has been captured on highspeed cameras where they&#x27;ve been able to slow down the object and actually capture detail and resolution.</p>
<p>Some of these objects are allegedly moving hypersonically at thousands of miles an hour. So, it&#x27;s not at all surprising that a camera, particularly the ubiquitous mobile phone cameras that we all use, aren&#x27;t capturing imagery. And I think a lot of people will make a big fuss, for example, about the gimbal and flur imagery that was captured by Pentagon cameras, mainly on fighter jets. Those cameras are primarily used for targeting, not for high resolution. And so, you&#x27;re always going to see a blur in infrared particularly.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not looking for a high resolution image on an IR camera or a Flur camera. There&#x27;s also limitations with a lot of these commercial devices. Not only do they use autofocus that prioritizes foreground elements and fails to lock on to distant or erratic objects, they also use digital compression. A lot of people send me videos on uh Twitter messaging or on WhatsApp and Signal and what they don&#x27;t realize is that those apps automatically compress. They lower the resolution of those images making them well nigh impossible to see any detail.</p>
<p>Low light conditions also amplify blurriness. And infrared or thermal sensors that are popular in a lot of the military UAP footage, they capture heat signatures rather than visible light, which means they&#x27;re capturing low resolution, often black and white images that look blurry compared to standard photographs. And even professional photographs, professional cameras, they can still produce artifacts from parallax. That&#x27;s apparent motion due to camera movement or gimbal rotation. [sighs] And then there&#x27;s the uh explanation that I think is one of the ones that I think is most plausible to me to explain why these things are very blurry all the time.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a prominent theory that posits that UAPs use an advanced propulsion system that warps spaceime around them, creating a bubble that decouples the craft from normal physics. This could bend light paths similar to um gravitational lensing around black holes and it could distort images that and in a way that makes the image appear fuzzy or smeared or distorted. And this is an explanation that I know Hal Putoff who I mentioned earlier, a physicist who used to work on the CIA&#x27;s remote viewing program and he he&#x27;s the co-founder of To the Stars Academy. [snorts] He&#x27;s described this blurring as an artifact of the propulsion system where a craft&#x27;s energy field reportedly curves light, radar, and even air around it. And this explains why UAPs reportedly perform extreme maneuvers without sonic booms or heat signatures because they&#x27;re in a bubble.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve got a bubble shielding them from the impact of that acceleration. But what that also apparently does is it warps available light, incoming light, and leads to blurry outlines. Um, there&#x27;s also another potential explanation, which is that some UAPs may actually use stealth technology. They may generate plasma fields or electromagnetic pulses that are actually designed to interfere with cameras and sensor systems. Um, you know, there&#x27;s there&#x27;s a suggestion that they&#x27;re using active camouflage that polarizes or oscillates light that makes them hard to photograph clearly.</p>
<p>I mean, if you are a non-human intelligence and you&#x27;re here primarily, let&#x27;s speculate to surveil nuclear platforms to find out what we&#x27;re doing with our nuclear weapons. Are we building nuclear weapons? Are we storing them in this facility? You don&#x27;t really want to be seen while you&#x27;re conducting ISR, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance over that site. So, it&#x27;s kind of self-explanatory that they&#x27;d want to hide. So, I think you know there&#x27;s good reason why they might to want to disguise themselves and operate under stealth. &gt;&gt; Okay, Ross, that is it for today.</p>
