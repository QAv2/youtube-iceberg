            <p>this is on another level Beyond f14s f-15s f-16s these are the unacknowledged special access programs that we as taxpayers are paying for with no Congressional oversight no public scrutiny it&#x27;s going on for sure here&#x27;s Joel&#x27;s illustration based on Rudy sketch of what this may have looked like you can see you&#x27;ve got the cockpit section pulled up we&#x27;ve got the composite panels and then what I want to do now is take you through a tour of this crash scene like we were actually there back in 1989 so here you see it&#x27;s already hit the the pine tree it&#x27;s already augured in Pilots have been recovered already we&#x27;re going to move on to the next slide here we&#x27;ve got all the military helicopters the scene is in full swing now go to the next one this is a about a 10 degree look down angle on the actual scene itself now you can see you&#x27;ve got some of the composite panels and some of the fiber optics are actually exposed and visible at this time the AFT sphere is still in place this is about a 3/4 rear view on the left hand side uh Pilots have already been recovered and then now this is a top view looking down on the inside of the cockpit section with a tandem co-pilot here&#x27;s some of these uh boxes that they were used to recover some of the debris and then here we are moving out one of these spheres with the super stallion fiew of The Craft itself and what they ended up doing here at this end of the retrieval operation when they recovered all of the composite fibers all of the uh composite aircraft construction they brought that over to the panel trucks ship them out and then once everything was done they took these incendiary grenades and blew up this entire operation so that no other material could be recovered</p>
