            <p>you&#x27;ve heard about Quantum entangled particles it can create a pair of particles that know about one another and that they separate it in space and in time and if You observe that other particle it instantly changes the state of the particle back the other particle that&#x27;s Back Where I Am by the way that they communicate instantaneously faster than the speed of light when you say If You observe do you mean that if You observe it with anything it doesn&#x27;t matter but you have to do something yeah you have to do yes so something has to interact with it&#x27;s not woo but it&#x27;s so not woo but people but you say that people go yeah I saw that in a secret yeah so the problem is the word observe people thinks there&#x27;s a is a psychological thing but in physics it&#x27;s got nothing to do a measurement it&#x27;s a measurement thing right if there is an electron sitting in the middle of this table and all the lights are out I can say I think there&#x27;s an electron here let me find out and the moment I turn on the lights light interacts a photon interacts with the electron and kicks it somewhere else</p>
