            <p>for Christmas can you just help me understand vectors please vectors are just straight arrows that point in a specific Direction and have a certain length so what kind of Arrow is 7 I + 3j Santa tell him what the I and the J mean shut up elf you bumper clot okay so think of the I as a horizontal step so across the x-axis and the J as a vertical step so going up the Y AIS ah so 7 I + 3 J would take us seven steps horizontally and then three up so we&#x27;d end up here and then we draw the arrow so this is how that Vector would look exactly so if this Vector was to describe the velocity of my sleigh as I leave your grandmother&#x27;s house oh so then you&#x27;d be going 7 m/ second horizontally 3 m/ second vertically and then your overall direction is the same direction of that Arrow the vector is pointing well done little boy</p>
