            <p>Now we are given this question. Um this question is under scala vector quantities. Okay. They said resolve a force of 100 Newton inclined at 50° to the horizontal into the horizontal and vertical or the vertical components. From this particular question we are asked to solve for two things right both the horizontal components and the vertical components.</p>
<p>Are you getting it? You know when we are solving for the yaxis like the four this cardinal point right? Let&#x27;s say this is a y ais right this is a positive y ais the negative y ais right the negative y ais then this is a positive x ais and this is negative xaxis isn&#x27;t it you know this is the horizontal line are you getting why this is a vertical line right you know when we are solving for x like when we are solving for x which is a horizontal line we make use of what cost right but when we are calculating for the vertical which is the yaxis we make use of sin theta isn&#x27;t it so let&#x27;s apply it here okay so meaning this is a sorry this is right while this is a vertical I getting so let&#x27;s apply it so for us to solve for the horizontal component The horizontal component we make use of cos okay so which is what fx isn&#x27;t it representing the horizontal axis okay so equal to f cos theta which is equal to the value of force is what look at it 100 cos the angle is what? 50. Are you getting it? This is it. This is the angle. Okay. 50°.</p>
<p>Then for the vertical component that is f_sub_y = what? F sin theta. So the value of force is 100. Then sin what? Sin 50°. So here it will now be 100 * by cos 50 is 0 0.64 27. So if you multiply everything it will be it will be 64.27 or you approximate.</p>
<p>Okay. So this is for the horizontal component. So for the um the vertical component that is we have 100 * so sin 50 that is 0 766. So if you multiply everything should be 76 76 6. Okay.</p>
<p>So this how to solve for the horizontal and the vertical component. Are you getting me? So when you are solving for the horizontal component you make use of cos. When solving for the vertical component you make use of sign. I get it. Okay, thanks for watching.</p>
