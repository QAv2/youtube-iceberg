            <p>hey we live in interesting times I think that we&#x27;re just about as a human race about to crack gravity modification and not just in hairbrain theories but actually experiments that have already demonstrated a positive effect and there&#x27;s one man who has been following all these breaking developments and that&#x27;s Tim Ventura you know Tim from his channel and he&#x27;s a friend of mine and has been a great collaborator with putting me in touch with these scientists if it wasn&#x27;t for Tim I wouldn&#x27;t have ever talked to the project greenlow people that you&#x27;ve just watched and the people at Falcon space but Tim Ventura has done something else something extraordinary he knows people who have samples of possible crashed UFO material extraterrestrial metal and exotic materials why that&#x27;s so important and fascinating is that those exotic materials might be the key to modifying gravity extra terrestrials if they have visited planet Earth need to control space time both time and space to cross the vast distances from their planet to ours how might they do that well new research is looking at the structure of the hull of their craft this has been known for a long time time your government and defense contractors have been looking at What&#x27;s called the five observables and one of those observables which is present globally worldwide is symmetry spheres and egg shape craft that might be a clue to how ET does modify gravity but if we have a sample of a whole of an extraterrestrial UFO craft we can copy it and if and why when we understand that it&#x27;s a giant leap for mankind a leap where we leave Earth so Tim Ventura and I would humbly like you to join us we have these regular discussions but today we talk about something extraordinary what&#x27;s the latest experimental science in producing anti-gravity effects and by examining exotic extraterrestrial material can we work out how UFOs work hey everybody you all know who this person is this is Tim ventur I have to say Tim is the most connected person in the universe well one of them he has the biggest roller deck I&#x27;ve &#x27;t come across whenever I want to know somebody I want to speak to Jeff or whoever I&#x27;ll go Tim do you happen to have Jeff&#x27;s email he goes oh yes he&#x27;s been on my show in the past and Tim&#x27;s real um uh interest right now as well as lots of other things because he&#x27;s an allround fantastic chat is is alternative propulsion and Gravity Research and Tim doesn&#x27;t just research on the web Tim actually goes out and meets the people and uh uh who are actually doing the experiments and very much he&#x27;s put me in touch with people like um uh Falcon space and and lots of others U I&#x27;m about to publish a film um on greenlow which was the bae um um Gravity Research with Ron Evans and and others so fantastic but the the key player in all of this bringing all this together and making it public on social media is Tim ventur so I I would be remiss not to talk about to Tim about alternative propulsion and gravity and so Tim you run something called ape tells the viewers what Apec is yeah yeah Simon well let me start by thanking you for having me on Channel it is truly an honor to be here with you today and you know they say when it comes to rolodexes Size Doesn&#x27;t Matter so you know put that out there um yeah I do I run the alternative propulsion engineering conference or it&#x27;s and our website is at alt propulsion domcom and actually one of the things that I am really excited about is we have had a couple of long-term projects with regular presenters and and they are finally coming to fruition uh and I I played kind of a minor role in both of those one as you mentioned Mark silal in the dynamic nuclear polarization I have been to conferences with him I&#x27;ve been to his lab in New Jersey um I have helped in a very minor way you know doing some filming and and cinematography there to try and help convey his message the other person is Jared Yates Jared has been doing a knockdown drag out on several USU o samples he has he has he he has analyzed two different samples of Arts Parts as well as the Frank kimbler bounce site sample and the let me see St Augustine wreckage samples yeah and then we also have um we have some unique paperwork on the danag gor crash wreckage and so for all of this we have this tremendous amount of data and the really amazing thing is for everything accept the Russian crash site the this is our own data like Jared has literally worked with Specialists all over the country doing scanning electron microscope as well as x-ray fluorescence and several other types of analysis he&#x27;s been working with Matthew sedus from the uh University at Albany and the scientific Coalition for UAP studies they did nuclear breakdown analysis on it so AB yeah we can immediately prove um you know is it terrestrial or extraterrestrial and also excitingly um some Mark&#x27;s been looking at some of the samples under uh his uh experimental equipment it&#x27;s great now if it&#x27;s okay do you think I could put in a plug for the upcoming alt propulsion conference well yeah not not only can you you must because and I think viewer if you really if you are interested or involved in this field um get involved with ape I mean yeah so please so there&#x27;s an upcoming conference tell us about it Tim okay well let me actually if it&#x27;s okay oops uh let me see screen sharing is not turned on um I&#x27;ll allow it there we go okay you&#x27;re more than welcome so this for for anybody who hasn&#x27;t seen it yet this is the alt propulsion conference this isn&#x27;t the homepage this is the March 15th upcoming one um we have Maddie panan who been doing Gravity Research for a very long time um he&#x27;s kicking things off uh Brian stclair is working on an inertial propulsion drive and he does some really amazing work and then Jared Gates is going to be presenting on Arts Parts and Matthew sedus is as well and so that is coming up here um I I have to say to viewers this isn&#x27;t in a Las Vegas hotel room this is international local it&#x27;s all online so don&#x27;t feel like you have to travel somewhere to a conference this is an online conference yeah now if I could ask them if if people are open to it we have a private announcement list we don&#x27;t spam but I would love to ask people to sign up for that again if you go to alt propulsion domcom you can sign up for that list and essentially we send out like four emails a month um two of them are reminders on the Wednesday before two of them are reminders on Saturday we always do our events on Saturdays and then we have what&#x27;s called an open mic which is just kind of an open get together where people talk and exchange information working groups and then we have webinars once a month and and my job is basically just hurting cats these are the Geniuses I I just you know I just heard cats so that&#x27;s oh yeah so I I I I&#x27;m a member and everybody should if you&#x27;re interested in in that in that in this field and it is we people we live in the most interesting times Well Done For Being Alive in 2025 because we live in a time where suddenly we are redefining how gravity works we are proving that we&#x27;re not alone in the universe and there&#x27;s a lot of things coming um going on in the science Community right now um and if you&#x27;re interested in science and uh what&#x27;s going on in the world and how humanity is going to change in the in the next coming decades um yeah be part of it because you are living in that uh time right now would you agree Tim do you think we that that I mean I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s going to I I think CNN and the media expect it to happen next week but I think um we I really think that we&#x27;re living like um in the so the equivalent of living in 1900 and in 1915 Einstein published general relativity I think we&#x27;re at that cusp of a whole lot of stuff coming together what do you think absolutely well and you know I so I have I have my own YouTube Interview Channel which you have been on and in fact I I should mention this so your your appearance I always get the most amazing feedback people absolutely love Professor Simon they&#x27;re like that&#x27;s wonderful to see him on your channel have him on again yeah putting people together I feel the same when you&#x27;re on my channel and other people it it&#x27;s a great thing another aspect of social media science as I call it or social media uh which is now the science broadcaster of the world it&#x27;s really fun for viewers to have uh people that are desperate you we watch Tim&#x27;s Channel we watch mine we watch whoever&#x27;s Ashton&#x27;s or Pav&#x27;s Channel and then it&#x27;s great when we can actually come together and share information so yeah no I that it&#x27;s good for the viewers and it&#x27;s good for us because because it&#x27;s a small community and we are all connected yeah yeah well and and so the interesting thing that I&#x27;ve been seeing I cover a lot of AI and what I&#x27;m seeing is scientists are starting to use AI not only to solve formulas Dr Jack Surat has sent several out where AI has solved formulas in three minutes that would take a physicist months potentially to do but also for research it will just dig through everything and bring up papers and ideas and it can synthesize different ideas together and so in terms of areas like Gravity Research and propulsion and energy generation things like that I mean I even I even know someone who is using chat GPT for personal therapy and she read some of what it said to her and I was just blown away it was amazing but it was helpful to her yeah oh great yeah incredibly yeah yeah remember back in the 1990s where you could talk to an AI type um uh Parrot uh and uh web and it would say so what do you think about that Tim it was and that is well known as useful therapy you know because it is talking therapy oh it&#x27;s great yeah well um you it&#x27;s amazing that you mentioned jet saati so um it I am just waking up here in France and you are about to go to bed and we both just open we&#x27;re both on this Jack saati email list and uh yeah suddenly as you say Jack and other physicists can now troll troll what the word is look um um look for data uh that um that AI um large large word models can pull together and it can come up with things that would take you me mortal a long time so yeah I&#x27;ve just literally been uh having my CL and my coffee reading Jack saa&#x27;s emails about what what how that works and that&#x27;s very interesting so yeah that&#x27;s yet another aspect of the interesting times we live in and so you and I are connected on Facebook also I see inside your personal world I see there there was a goat I&#x27;ve seen I&#x27;ve seen the croissant the coffee you know so I&#x27;ve seen your wonderful house it&#x27;s it&#x27;s amazing it is amazing well you&#x27;re very welcome to come but yeah yeah yeah no be yeah we live in interesting times um so talking to the green glow people so green glow was a project run by uh Bae who are a large defense Corporation in the United Kingdom and they obviously their bosses were very interested in is it possible to modify or gravity in one way or another and they hired these people to do it so um so there must be an interest in that but from defense contractors and also for the science Community um do do you think we&#x27;re now on the cusp post greenlow and and what they found and what other people are working on in in being able to understand a better way of how gravity works we are getting yeah yeah and in fact um we were talked about Jack sarfati a moment ago so Jack sarfati a few years back started talking about what&#x27;s called gravitational metam materials and I think the general idea is that gravity is the weakest Force by far right and so if you want to directly modify that you have to find ways to amplify that interaction and he did very detailed rigorous relativistic physics so that&#x27;s top down physics that said yes if you find gravitational metam materials that can basically change the refractive index of gravity then you could create this UFO warp drive that was his idea so this takes us back to Arts Parts because Jared Gates doing the scanning electron micrograph stuff he is seeing structures that look like Nano structures he seeing things that look like Nano gold wires as well as microl layering Junctions at microlayers and so in fact Choice materials as well because we we we were beginning to get that there are unique there are metals with unique materials as well can be alloyed or layered yeah and and I am happy if if you&#x27;re open to it let me do a very quick share um this is just some this is just a tiny amount of of basically the work that was done this is Falcon space I was able to bring this up in a hurry they put this on a scanning electron microscope this is the original Arts part sample that we started working with last year that&#x27;s the stuff and this is just a tiny fraction of you know of the work that was done and so I you know I I have this this is a part of my flicker Galleries and I I&#x27;m happy to provide you with a link if anyone wants this so who who who who is this woman who is this what what&#x27;s her this so this was a third-party company in terms of sem we have actually had I think four or five different companies involved with it oh man and so these these are just some of the photos yeah I&#x27;ve never seen these These are fascinating look at that yeah what is it oh yeah it&#x27;s interesting stuff yeah this is the bisou Magnesium microl layer right and right um there were there&#x27;s a lot going on here and so again this Saturday Jared Gates is going to drill down the other part that I can&#x27;t stress enough is so the the photos that I have of this are are I mean again I&#x27;m showing you a ton of them he has hundreds and hundreds of photos as well as x-ray fluorescence and what&#x27;s called Neutron activation analysis um again I&#x27;m happy to drop a link I I&#x27;ll drop a link to my my link Tree in there so that people can look but people love to see this I I I think maybe we should um for people who don&#x27;t quite understand met materials Define what a matter material is you know it&#x27;s not a material that necessarily um well it actually does something because of its form and structure a good metam material would be um a coating for a stealth aircraft so if you could coat an aircraft with a material and it doesn&#x27;t absorb microwave radi radar energy it doesn&#x27;t absorb it energy isn&#x27;t created or destroyed keep that one in mind it refracts it it reflects it it dis it it disrupts it in in counterintuitive ways so it&#x27;s not reflected back and that interaction at different em frequencies or even gravitational frequencies if that&#x27;s what it is um is is amazing we now have metam materials that work in Optical wavelengths I mean I mean yeah thank thanks to Imperial College London and that&#x27;s uh something that help bof and his company have been working on on that as purely as a camouflage I mean imagine if you had a tank covered in a meta material that didn&#x27;t reflect visible light well that exists yeah so again you mentioned Hal POF Hal POF did testing of Arts Parts in 2012 and Dr Jim sagala helped him with that as well as some other people the indic that I have was that um when they applied a terahertz frequency to that if I remember right it took off it flew and so there is this idea terahertz is a very difficult band to get to because semiconductor packaging tends to reabsorb it but it can be done and there are several reasons why that frequency range would be preferable and so he had that indication and then Travis Taylor right from Skinwalker Ranch Travis worked on Linda Molton house sample back in the 1990s Source right right yeah and he had levitation as well back in the day so there&#x27;s some interesting there&#x27;s a lot going on here and viewers need to know terahertz it you know has the word Terror but it&#x27;s what it&#x27;s it&#x27;s t r r a it it it&#x27;s a frequency that&#x27;s above what we call the microwave Spectrum so it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a bridging frequency Which is higher than say centimet um it&#x27;s less than centimeters it&#x27;s in a millimeter Wave band um says me maybe and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s the intermediate frequency between this is wrong but this is a good way of looking at it between microwaves and visible light so it&#x27;s an incredibly interesting band and it&#x27;s very very high hard to produce so when if that is producible uh it might have interesting it obviously does have interesting effects that that that was my science um 101 on What terahertz is because I didn&#x27;t know is that roughly right oh yeah yeah and there is so much to this story and again you know for in my in my opinion this is the biggest UFO story of 2025 and the thing for me that&#x27;s so exciting about it is that it is based entirely on hard work perseverance and true science you know and experimentation it&#x27;s not just it&#x27;s just not people&#x27;s opinion and speculative thought they&#x27;re actually testing this stuff there are a lot of other story and I&#x27;m sure that we will see more in the UFO headlines right there&#x27;s a lot going on and I know that you were following about some stories also randim I guess is coming back into the headlines you mentioned that the other day should well happen there is so important to understand and and it&#x27;s not what you think yeah so so there&#x27;s a lot there this one though I think at least so far um this one is it&#x27;s building on itself and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s somewhat predictable we&#x27;re seeing lots of new and exciting things come out of it but it&#x27;s not like a big claim from nowhere it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very much based in hard work and and for me that&#x27;s really exciting and and Gerard and Mark and Travis and and and house have got results uh that there&#x27;s actually an effect from this um unique samples which apparently come from um our which we can say probably are extra tral I&#x27;ve been working with beis vill Royale I&#x27;m very excited to say that so beatric has started an EU only purely because of of legal matters but it&#x27;s Global UAP UFOs have to be Global they have to be uh seen all over this Earth and what she started is that there are many cold and maybe some hot cases of Crash sites in Europe so she&#x27;s pting together yeah of course I mean they&#x27;re going to crash in Sweden and they&#x27;re going to crash you know in all in in my Village in France maybe H as well as crashing in in the United States because there&#x27;s an awful lot of the UFO Community kind of think that UFOs only occur in the US well of course they have to be they have to be um throughout the whole of the earth don&#x27;t they because they&#x27;re coming if but so anyway what beus has started with this program is to um get every everybody in Europe um sharing Legends and myths which might be an ancient folk memory of something that crashed and she&#x27;s investigating all the stories of Crash sites uh from ancient records ancient crash sites maybe a new one would occur but she she&#x27;s hoping it would but and she&#x27;s going around sample collecting and I&#x27;ve already found the most amazing source of samples so you know in ancient Europe that often uh modern human religions Christianity in Europe specifically built churches on top of ancient pre-christian sites uh sites of special interest hillsides crash sides whatever they are and um often you know to kind of uh absorb whatever the uh pre-christian or we want to call it pagan beliefs were about that special place and um often in European and in uh specifically in Russian churches they have something called um uh icons or or um uh bits of that of special relevance that come from the pre site so um just looking around the French um Department of of relics that&#x27;s a word sorry relics um they have a log of every Relic that is held um uh in Christian churches they often encased in glass they&#x27;re built into the altar there might be in a Dusty drawer and some of them Tim are metal from an ancient yeah that they dug up before they built the church and there thousands hundreds thousands of years old what are they that makes me that makes me wonder actually it brings two things to mind beatric is absolutely wonderful she I know she is going through over a hundred years of astronomical photos and again this comes back to AI when she&#x27;s able to put that into AI the the mind boggles at what she&#x27;ll be able to find but the idea is brilliant and then the other thing that is relatively new it would be wonderful to see someone use ground penetrating radar at these ancient sites what would they find we need to dig them up yeah I what all I&#x27;m doing is and she agrees that it&#x27;s a good a good approach is that many of the uh sites you know are where kind of Legend turns into myth and we need to turn that myth back into science That&#x27;s my kind of Catchphrase on that and we need to go and dig it up or just ask the church you know what&#x27;s that piece of metal you&#x27;ve got in a in a in a case above the altar you know is it is is it the finger of Christ or is it is it a piece of the crash UFO I mean I mean it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a long shot but I think it it certainly uh that research is going on and and the other thing about Arts Parts I would like to say and you will know this fantastic story that ay lobe tells is that when if we don&#x27;t we might not necessarily understand it by looking at it going because he tells the story if you showed an iPhone to ancient humans they would use their culture their knowledge to look at it and eventually after not understanding anything about why an iPhone operates and how it&#x27;s built they would look at it and say it&#x27;s a Shiny Rock and I think in some ways when we&#x27;re looking at uh at meta materials from from an ET or a future time it&#x27;s hard to assess because it&#x27;s going to be so different and complex so the the work that Jared has been doing in terms of these meta materials has led him towards the work of CLE Irwin and CLE Irwin actually has a hyperdimensional model of it and the idea is that if you look at strategically placed Nano dots on the surface of material which Jared thinks he may have found if you look at those they don&#x27;t make sense in three dimensions but if you visualize them as part of higher dimensional field then all of a sudden it could form a cube or a wall or whatever you need and this comes out of clein work which is also interesting because CLE is he is a contemporary of Jack serati and they agree on many things including time travel they are both time travel Advocates sure oh interesting times that&#x27;s great isn&#x27;t that fantastic so suddenly the structure of Arts Parts um might appear completely impossible to understand but by um smart people Ai and people assessing it some I think the the the key word in our caveman age is to think about meta materials to think think about how materials affects um uh gra I mean the other thing that is absolutely fascinating and I really wanted to ask Ron Evans from greenlow about Gravity Research was gravity um if we take the einsteinian model of the the two words joined together SpaceTime mass is uh the side effect of of altering SpaceTime by mass is gravity but I think he he Ron uh Ron is very down on that now he thinks that&#x27;s an old model that needs to be updated and I think that&#x27;s interesting but what I wanted to ask Ron and he was great and answering is gravity modification is also time modification you can&#x27;t with gravity without affecting space time time and so he said absolutely um making a flying car making an airplane lighter than air uh wasn&#x27;t what their goal was I mean maybe a defense contractor would want that but what they found was in fact if you mess with gravity you mess both with um well you also mess with time and I think that&#x27;s that they&#x27;re linked you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t uh not separate them is that what people are finding you getting that kind of feel they are and and so Jack Surat doesn&#x27;t believe that paradoxes are an issue and that is because of the way that he looks at Clos Tim like curves I just did I did an interview on it was actually on Quantum Computing with the fellon name William mini and he had said the prevailing wisdom is that if you run into a paradox it&#x27;s it&#x27;s because of a shortcoming of the model and not the universe and so he thinks that there&#x27;s an alternative as well so is interesting it&#x27;s very intriguing idea and I I don&#x27;t claim to have any special knowledge but you know it it&#x27;s I think the quest itself and the the research leads to new discoveries yeah you know like with chn Computing um just as an example they have this idea that it may be many worlds Theory or it may prove many worlds right and it&#x27;s just like like you said so many big things are happening right now it&#x27;s really exciting very exciting times yeah and I think it&#x27;s all kind of coming together you know we&#x27;ve had you know we&#x27;ve had people yeah I&#x27;m seeing connections with Stanford&#x27;s research and distant viewing I mean remote viewing I mean suddenly suddenly what they were probably doing and we know that it works it was temporal it wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t Geographic they were doing rot viewing in time and um and then we got rer Penrose looking at microtubules and and his colleague looking at how anesthetic PHS work it&#x27;s all connected it&#x27;s all connected to a um a alternative physics where we don&#x27;t have linear time and when we understand that more and exploit it uh for good I hope for the good of mankind I mean fantastic and I think we&#x27;re right on that cusp yeah and the the Consciousness and the remote viewing aspect of things I mean I I think everyone has I think we have all had synchronicities and premonitions and strange things happen right that that it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s something there and I don&#x27;t understand it and that that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m currently at I don&#x27;t claim to have any special wisdom but it&#x27;s kind of like UFOs I don&#x27;t understand all of it but you know it&#x27;s like where there&#x27;s smoke there&#x27;s fire so there&#x27;s something going on definitely yeah yeah in that Consciousness thing absolutely Tim you&#x27;re right I mean we have we have words that we use on a daily basis like I have a gut feeling about the future okay why why you know and and it&#x27;s often it&#x27;s not just adding up two and two what um I had a great interview with Russell tar and Russell said um that the best people to predict the future aren&#x27;t Gypsy Rose Lee and a crystal ball in the fairground who want to actually tell you the answer that you that you paid her for that you will me to tall dark stranger or whatever he said the best people who do um um remote viewing are investment bankers because a little company comes into them and goes I&#x27;ve made a new battery and it&#x27;s fantastic I would like to borrow a million dollars from your bank and you&#x27;ll make your money back and it will be the best thing since slice bread and all they know is the people who present them um and maybe a prototype battery and they have to look into the future and say will I make my money back and will I make a profit and Russell says that they have they were one of the people in Industry who had the best tuned in remote viewing capabilities isn&#x27;t yeah because they needed to do it I think it&#x27;s great yeah that&#x27;s not surprising at all it makes a it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting I I&#x27;d never thought of that he had talked about playing the silver market too yeah he did way back when and and and his description you can see this on on various talks that he&#x27;s give he&#x27;s described how he did it and when I I watch really carefully because I&#x27;ve got this you know I really want to understand her remote viewing works because I&#x27;m really interested in Consciousness and Roger Penrose and tubular um micr tubal and things and Quantum kind of timelessness and it when Russell tar described how he actually did uh make a lot of money uh hundreds of thousands of dollars on the Silver&#x27;s Futures Market by predicting the future direction of silver price going up or down um he described how he did it and when he when he tells you how he did it suddenly you get to understand how remote viewing works it seems like the hu that us humans uh have an immense ability to remember a future emotional event so a a successful happy ending in our future is Remembered in the past by some people I think we all do it but some people are better than others so Russell what he did was he very much rewarded with positive outcome with positive you got it right to his remote viewers when they got the stock market right and in the future and so he could ask their remote viewers in the week before what do you think is going to happen in your future and they had the ability to remember the positive outcome of their prediction I mean it sounds I mean it it sounds like Al bollocks is a word I use a lot but it isn&#x27;t we do that all the time and certain people are are better at it Yuri Geller also um says that uh you can&#x27;t remember numbers you can&#x27;t predict um written text that&#x27;s all high processing what you what you can feel in the future is an emotional uh event in your future and he uses that emotional event to um to to predict things I I we need to understand that it&#x27;s it&#x27;s great fantastic it is it&#x27;s it&#x27;s intriguing So speaking of emotional events right now I am fighting with my social media that&#x27;s been my project for the last two weeks social media well so you know and is a little bit of an aside but it&#x27;s it is so interesting now that we have the new Administration and we have Elon right who were making all these changes so LinkedIn has turned into a Battleground Twitter for me at least seems completely distracted and so I&#x27;ve been exploring different networks the the one that was intriguing was um Blue Sky the Blue Sky kind of alternative to Twitter people seem to be boiling out of Twitter into that one and then the other one interestingly is a lot of the UFO Community is going to Instagram that&#x27;s kind of what I found so far oh I yeah well well right it&#x27;s we as we are social media science we need to tap into that social Trend um oh that&#x27;s very interesting yeah good think still has the um a very good ability to upload video and and it&#x27;s you know it it it it totally transformed the world iing Market to be honest that&#x27;s its main thing it did but but yeah no to connect to people um in in ways that where they are oh good good research Tim good yeah yeah well and YouTube seems like it is more of a universal base I guess right and it&#x27;s not as susceptible to it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s as susceptible to fighting as some of these other platforms and so that that maybe that&#x27;s why but yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s interesting this is going to be an interesting interesting year and you know and definitely the near future I I mean in terms of AI also there is so much Brewing there that you know the the Deep seek just came out they&#x27;re talking about dropping the price of things like open AI by by a factor of you know 10 or more and then you&#x27;ve got uh a new one called Manus I think out of China That&#x27;s supposed to automate complex tasks and supposedly it can run in the background when you&#x27;re not there so very interesting Technologies coming out oh I think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s brilliant I I&#x27;ve seen a complete change in my I&#x27;m old and I you know tend to stick to Old Paradigm models of how I do things and um I I now use a search engine like Google purely to find images and things that I kind of know that are already there it&#x27;s just a it&#x27;s just a look it literally it&#x27;s just a way of looking stuff up I don&#x27;t use it to search for information I use I use um uh A variation on chat GPT to ask questions and you know okay and and also um in multil languages so you know we live here in France and French bureaucracy is a giant um uh complex mess sometimes and um they are continually changing things so I can ask in English language tell me what French driver&#x27;s licenses are changing their policy about insurance in 2025 now to for me to find that in French from a French bureaucratic site would would be almost impossible um uh but um or I just have to speak to friends or something but I can now type that query into an AI model and it will look it up in the French bureaucratic system translate it back into English and give me the answer I was like this is what amazing tool we have it&#x27;s very and I trust it you know it seems to be correct coming back to science I mean we have tens or hundreds of thousands of papers that are related to these emerging esoteric Technologies in one way or another right and right now it&#x27;s a process it&#x27;s largely a process of knowing the players by reputation and following the citations and looking carefully to see if they&#x27;re citing correctly you know and and it&#x27;s so if you can get AI to do that I mean the world is your oyster right so sure I mean you can do queries now like you know read a paper check references and give me links to all the references I mean literally that kind of thing that would have taken a team of researchers you know a long time to actually pull out for you if you&#x27;re a journalist or a scientist uh no no it it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really interesting so how&#x27;s how&#x27;s um tell me a bit more about a lot of people have been asking me about Falcon space because you know I&#x27;ve been um talking about them in passing and you&#x27;ve had a lot of stuff with Falcon space how um Ron Evans and greenlow were wondering how they&#x27;re funded and because they were talking about institutional funding and private funding what&#x27;s the how do Falcon space pay for their research you know I yeah well Mark Mark owns he he owns his own company and so I I think a lot of it is I know a lot of it is kind of shest string budget pulling things together as he&#x27;s able to um you know and so he just basically he he is I would say he is beyond passionate and Beyond motivated I met Mark I think in 2020 he approached me to start doing the APAC conference and he said we want to do an anti-gravity conference it&#x27;s going to be the best in the world and you have to moderate it and at the time it scared me I mean my I I remember the first thing when he said that on the phone I was like oh hell no and I hung up on him and he called back and I&#x27;m like it was the pandemic so I thought you know what why not yeah apex&#x27;s great it&#x27;s really taken off and it&#x27;s good and and yeah Mark yeah so Mark&#x27;s very motivated I mean I think one of the things that we were talking about is a bit about big science and big science funding you know um and that seems to be a bit a bit of a broken model right now from it&#x27;s dicey yeah I just talked to uh Anna Estes Brady and she was over at the NSF they had a big presentation uh Falcon space was one of their presenters but they probably had I think a dozen or more presenters back in November December and she I believe she&#x27;s going into the private sector now which she said the NSF funding has changed a lot even in the last few months so right here so I mean Sabine horse Feller what her name is German fantastic woman and is very in touch with what&#x27;s going on in the science community in Germany and Europe and she&#x27;s really ranting about how big science here in Europe just tends to perpetuate funding of existing projects and there&#x27;s very little money going into to um novel ideas in fact the whole science Community don&#x27;t like novel ideas uh in her opinion I mean I think scientists are open-minded really but but also you know when it comes down to getting their project funded um they I don&#x27;t think many of them take big risks you know so a massive project like Sur will just build on what they&#x27;ve done and not go off at a tangent um and I think that&#x27;s wrong I think it there needs to be um funding for big science um um which is established and keeps people employed and and and that science moving forward and but there needs to be funding for Maverick science and and stuff oh yeah absolutely and I don&#x27;t think that exists I think that&#x27;s really yeah well and not just in I mean not just in like Gravity Research but even in things like battery research one of the things that intrigued me is you in terms of lithium ion batteries there are at least four or five Alternatives that perform better and have more power right that really aren&#x27;t being developed because the money isn&#x27;t there to fund them and there&#x27;s this Gap where it&#x27;s like well you know Tesla would use this if it existed but it doesn&#x27;t exist so they won&#x27;t spend money to use it and it&#x27;s like okay guys you got to think ahead a little bit like you know you could say the same thing about rocket technology right like the the SpaceX fulcon is wonderful today okay what about in 50 years you don&#x27;t want to be using the same thing 50 years from now so yeah all the gravity researchers I&#x27;ve spoken to really rant about I mean yeah SpaceX has got a lowcost launch system um but we need to move away from from liquid uh or re or or usable propellants uh for Humanity to to escape into deep space really we can&#x27;t we can&#x27;t carry propellants with us we need to tap into other methods of propulsion I mean we&#x27;re going to be trapped on Earth we you know it it I can see why in the short as you say in the short term SpaceX has done amazing work but it&#x27;s not a long-term future I mean for me I try and visualize things like overlapping Paths of research right you have down here on the bottom you have rockets and Rockets are improving in so many ways right in terms of payloads and thrust and control I mean you look at like you know Elon Musk is landing them on the Launchpad now it&#x27;s amazing but so you have that down at the Baseline and then above that and it&#x27;s staggered then you&#x27;ve got your nuclear propulsion right and there are a lot of things that you can use that for but it has issues like cooling systems that&#x27;s a major issue and so it&#x27;s a little bit further out and then I think that we need to get started on this today but it&#x27;s staggered even further is Field Effect propulsion gravity propulsion right and that&#x27;s what um things like that are what Charlie buer the the NASA electrostatic specialist and Andrew rigma at Exodus are working with so another we already have fantastic what what great yeah I mean he&#x27;s and again he&#x27;s actually an experimentalist I mean it&#x27;s based on Theory but he&#x27;s actually shown effects with more than more than oneg um uh effects it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s fantastic and and again in the case of Drew right Andrew rigma in case of Drew and Charlie Drew has built and tested thousands and thousands prototypes and so effectively they have proven this be field Brown Field Effect propulsion not iron wind but true reactionless Field Effect and the part that I love about it was it wasn&#x27;t any kind of a magic stroke of the pen that did it it was it was hard work perseverance and very careful attention to detail over you know it&#x27;s close to a decade now so yeah right model real physical models and experimentations and vacuum tanks and and lots of yes yeah yeah build and tests building tests build and test and they see the small effect and it is it&#x27;s a when they I mean it is still it is still very small effect but it was almost too small to measure when they first started they&#x27;ve been able to improve it over a millionfold now it&#x27;s still small so it&#x27;s still small so so I I&#x27;m I kind of remember working on TV programs about I ion wind and lifters and things like that it was big in my era when I was working in TV and so is it that there was always a hint that it wasn&#x27;t just an ionic um tonian repulsion obviously only working in in in atmosphere because it was it was affecting it was lift in our atmosphere but what&#x27;s bring me up to speed on this Tim what what was was there was there a secret magic bit of ionic propulsion which isn&#x27;t just neonian uh reaction and and a non-reaction I&#x27;m I&#x27;m making I&#x27;m making that very complicated you know excuse me does it how does it work apart from just pushing irons out of a pin so I I used to build what they called lifters back in the day how I got into this area and and those were predominantly ion wind but we always felt at the time um and there were a number of tests that suggested this right you put it in sort of a sealed enclosure and spin it and it would stop spinning would self- stabilize so there were lots and lots of little tests that said to us there more here than just ion wind right and and I think that&#x27;s that this goes back to TT Brown TT Brown was working with devices he knew what iron wind was you had deki at the time who had the flying bed spring back in the 50s he knew what iron wind was they were all familiar with it and Brown still said this is asymmetrical capacitance this is a Field Effect propulsion it is not the same but I think the challenge has been the iron wind is so predominant at the higher voltages that it&#x27;s been very very difficult to test now in bu&#x27;s case with Exodus one of the brilliant things they&#x27;ve done is drop the voltage down they&#x27;re only working at a few thousand volts so you don&#x27;t have the ion wind to begin with and they&#x27;re able to measure the the the remaining force and they&#x27;re doing it in vacuum as well so there&#x27;s no oh yes hard vacuum yeah and and again Drew has Drew has become yeah he is a master of vacuum Chambers he has incredible knowledge and training there so yeah yeah it&#x27;s exciting don&#x27;t do it at home he he drew is hilarious he said yeah that&#x27;s right it&#x27;s not going to work with a vacuum cleaner in in a bucket no yeah it seems yeah no It&#x27;s Tricky It&#x27;s Tricky it takes a long I you know I visited Drew&#x27;s lab last year and he walked me through it and it is tricky I mean the Chambers it it is it see it&#x27;s one of those things that seems linear until you start to learn about how they work and what can go wrong and work and weak and stuff like um if you use the wrong oil and the pump then the oil will sublimate you get oil Vapor right so just lots and lots of little stuff that can cause trouble uh Tim Tim you&#x27;re really at The Cutting Edge of this it it it it&#x27;s good and um yeah we live in interesting times I&#x27;m also hearing um a lot more about um proof that we&#x27;re probably not alone in the universe um there&#x27;s certainly now being spectral analysis of exoplanet atmospheres which is finding interesting results I mean and um and Brit risten and seti carry on with new tools to look at um technological signatures but in very very interesting ways the techn ological signature doesn&#x27;t have to be an alien version of the I Love Lucy show it&#x27;s just a signature of something which isn&#x27;t a natural process um it might be a um one of the things that they&#x27;re looking for is illumination a reflection um imagine an exoplanet that that um had structures which were shiny it&#x27;s very unlikely that a large and the pattern of the shininess would would indicate an intelligent design um loads of things are going on in that field and the other thing that we have again in this amazing year of 2025 and I think this decade that we&#x27;re living in is that we now using AI no longer have spheres on the pl on our planet you don&#x27;t have an you don&#x27;t need to have the separation of a radio telescope in Australia and one in in in England they&#x27;re both interconnected you know they they share their data we now have Global networking of radio telescopes and the radio telescope um uh science field are really have always been very good at sharing because when they see something in the night sky they need to get their mate in Hawaii and their mate in Namibia to look at it you know and and that and they&#x27;re very good at doing that so and now all that data is shared and is being processed in novel ways to look for patterns um I&#x27;m I&#x27;m slightly disappointed that se has gone a bit dark and bra through listen With Yuri Milner funding isn&#x27;t actually publishing as far as I know very many new results I worry that there&#x27;s a bit of a bit of keeping quiet going on have you heard anything about I I haven&#x27;t I haven&#x27;t the one that I&#x27;ve been kind of focused on is you know coming up in the next two years good to space telescopes uh the Nancy Roman Grace Space Telescope is going to be up by 2027 and that they&#x27;re going to use that to spot what they believe are the best potential worlds and then they have something called habitable world&#x27;s Observatory expected to launch the 2040s that&#x27;s right and so I am so excited about that even if we don&#x27;t see alien spaceships or Little Green Men it&#x27;s still very likely that we&#x27;ll start to see planets with biospheres with life right for me that&#x27;s that is so exciting and I think that the psychological change of knowing there&#x27;s life out there in the universe will open people up to things like the UAP phenomena and saying wait a minute maybe it is visiting us you know we know it&#x27;s there now right it&#x27;s not just something we suspect no no no I think yeah it&#x27;s it would be a sea change it would be amazing for Humanity to actually have that confirmation and I think it&#x27;s a very I I I think there was a fear that it would be unsettling and terrifying and I think not I think it I think it&#x27;s an incredibly positive thing it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a big step for Humanity to realize that uh we&#x27;re not alone in the universe it&#x27;s just the best thing ever I really hope in our lifetime that that can be published and that the what they&#x27;re finding at present my my inside um gossip on what people are telling me is there&#x27;s lots of things we found Simon but we&#x27;re not ready to publish it yet I mean that&#x27;s what um certainly seti did a um a consultation uh about publishing when they find something which is pretty good evidence or confirmation put it like that and they were advised I have heard not to necessarily come out with it straight away because as soon as we tell people we think think we found life on another planet they&#x27;ll want to know what do they look like what are they saying and things like that whereas you mean Tim you we we live on a planet here Earth with only one organic creature humans really that make the I Love Lucy show I mean I live in a farm I have incredibly intelligent goats and sheep and rescue dogs and cats and birds and they are very happy living in a on a planet where they have um they&#x27;re safe and they have enough to eat they don&#x27;t necessarily they&#x27;re not technological so we there&#x27;s going to be life from microbial level to Mr Blobby out there I&#x27;m sure well and going back to uh contact right the movie that was inspired by the Carl San book you know they talked about life reaches out that that you know it&#x27;s part of Natural Curiosity it&#x27;s part of the learning process and it&#x27;s driven by not wanting to be alone in the universe I think those are beautiful motives for us to reach out as well as for life out there to reach out to us so that&#x27;s for me that that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all wonderful I think it&#x27;s great I mean ay L talks about going to walking down your street and meeting your neighbors and it&#x27;s exactly right I mean we can&#x27;t live in an isolated little house um we know we live in a street and we can now see the other houses all we have to do is go and knock on their door or listen you know and actually what look through the window and see what they&#x27;re watching no I&#x27;m joking but I mean that&#x27;s how ay talks about it and it&#x27;s absolutely true oh oh Tim thank you so much for your connectivity your uhing mind and your Rolodex I mean it it it it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic um and hopefully uh your channel and other channels can um bring these people to um to uh to others to an audience I mean you are pushing people on that most people would never hear from well thank you and I I want to have you back on as well again you your audience I I am speaking as a third party when you&#x27;re on my channel your audience writes in says we love Simon have Simon on more so you you connect with people and you educate people and you have a massive library of amazing educational materials so thank you sir thank you yeah no no yeah no as you say I mean we are we are just we are vectors to to bring this story to a general public and you&#x27;re right I mean the audience is everything really I mean the questions that they ask I get it&#x27;s really interesting I read the responses uh comment sections on YouTube and um yeah a lot of people need basic um Science Education which I hopefully yeah we can we can fill them into the basics so they understand how amazing uh science is and and the amazing time that we live in and then other people wow every day I wake up and get a long comment or a personal email because they&#x27;ve dug me out of my email address and they send me things I&#x27;m going oh that&#x27;s amazing and really interesting ideas and theories and things that people are working on yeah no it&#x27;s great so I I think we should continue to connect people to Breaking science Tim I think it&#x27;s a good Quest that we&#x27;re on so thank you well Simon thank you yet again sir thank you yet again oh it&#x27;s always a pleasure so who um so the ape conference again on the 15th of March is coming up um uh join it online virtually from anywhere in the world and and that will be great you&#x27;ve got some real keynote speakers on on that and then um in your short term or or if you want to reveal longer term future who are you talking to who you what what what are you planning to do on your channel and bringing to the world so the the only person that I have scheduled right now is fellow named Tom Hastings and I&#x27;m happy to forward him over to you if you&#x27;d like he runs a website called UFO hackers. org and so he is a cyber security professional he&#x27;s in the Seattle area near where I am yeah and he covers three different cases one of those as you and everyone knows is Gary McKinnon right the world&#x27;s most famous UFO hacker I and I know Gary yeah yeah g and Gary is wonderful Gary is a wonderful person um and so he talks about Gary&#x27;s case but there are two others that happened before that and then he also has some links in there to speakers on cyber security things along those lines so I I&#x27;m going to be doing an interview with him and I&#x27;m more than happy to forward him your way um and then I&#x27;m just kind of keeping my nose to the grindstone but but again I&#x27;m getting distracted with Social Media stuff because it is it&#x27;s chaotic right now it&#x27;s very chaotic yeah I don&#x27;t know how you work but I mean I wake up in the morning and I I open my iPad in bed with a copy and a quong and I go whoa every day I don&#x27;t have to search for stories they are out there there&#x27;s so much going on in on our planet right now in science and in the UFO research and in and in in all kinds of science actually um um yeah um I have to actually filter to what story I actually cover because there&#x27;s so much there&#x27;s so many interesting stories um out there um we live in interesting times so thank you Tim and and yeah yeah keep connect and we are going to bring breakthroughs to our viewers [Music]</p>
