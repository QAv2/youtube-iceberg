            <p>Did ancient India possess blueprints for jet engines 5,000 years before the Wright brothers? Ancient Sanskrit texts known as the Vimmanica Shastra contain detailed manuals for crafts called vimmanas. These texts don&#x27;t just tell stories, they describe complex propulsion systems using mercury vortex engines. The manuals are so specific they include instructions for pilot clothing and diet to survive space flight. When NASA engineers tested the conicle design of these machines in a wind tunnel, the results were shocking. They confirmed that the aerodynamic shape is actually viable for vertical takeoff and high-speed flight.</p>
<p>Critics say it&#x27;s just mythology. But why would a myth include technical schematics for engine parts? If our ancestors were already exploring the skies, we have to ask ourselves,</p>
