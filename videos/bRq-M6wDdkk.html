            <p>oh hello viewers today I will describe how three-phase generator produces the voltage in reality so you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s actually pretty simple but I will show you now I will explain you what are the basic points which we have to know to understand how actually three phase voltage which is over here is produced in with the physical devices like magnets and coils and you will see it simple okay what we have here we have here our setup of the generator so this is totally nine nine coils and twelve magnets and what happens one help what do we get when this magnets are moving around these nine coils so if you can see each third coil is interconnected like this blue line yeah this blue line over here it&#x27;s interconnected and that we have these three coils represent actually one phase another set to A to B to C represent another set and 3a 3b 3c last set of last phase so when first magnet go fly over over the first coil one a what do we have what do we have as a result of voltage you&#x27;ll see now if you see this red it&#x27;s it means called one it represents coil 1 so one eight point B 1 C and the phase one this is the phase one of three phase system and when the north-facing pole magnet crosses above the coil 1 a 1 B and C we have a plus 24 volts so this peak over here represents the plus 24 volts and then if you see the second set of magnets which are coming are of course South Pole not North South Pole this is yellow ones so when when they come to this chord 1a 1b and 1c in the same moment we will have the minus 24 volts and this is something over here that this curved part down curved part over here and the same principle is for the cord - so this is the - 8 - B - C or for phase 2 however you want to call it and the coil 3 or phase 3 call 3a 3b 3c so when the north-facing pole crosses above the core in 1a we have plus 24 volts and when the south-facing pole crosses above coral 1a we have minus 24 volts and this is the whole secret total secret is what I explained you so wide are shifted coil 1 it&#x27;s the phases here called 2 phases here called 3 phase is here plus 2014 so this is this axis means time so if you watch the image you will see that it cannot happen that in same time because we have 12 magnets and nine coils it can be in same time around each three phases they&#x27;re shifted a little bit in time so this means that let&#x27;s say when the coil one has plus 24 volts co2 will have few milliseconds later and coil 3 or phase 3 few milliseconds later and this is it so this is like the shift in the in the time and this is all what you need to know about three-phase system so we can recap again we have 3 times 3 coils connected in series to get one phase and another 3 second phase and another 3 third phase when the nurse north-facing pole crosses above the coil 1 1a 1b 1c we get plus 24 volts and when the south-facing pole crosses above all 1a 1b 1c we have minus 24 volts and this same stands for the phase 2 Phase three hello yours that was a short representation of how is three phase voltage produced in three phase generator it&#x27;s actually really simple you saw that but now you actually understand it visually that that&#x27;s why I wanted to show you with fingers and and and and everything that you see in which moment which phase is producing which voltage in which polarity and this is if we Norton&#x27;s north and south facing poles from the magnets and when they are spinning or or 24 plus 24 or minus 24 volts and this is the whole mystery thanks for watching until another time bye bye</p>
