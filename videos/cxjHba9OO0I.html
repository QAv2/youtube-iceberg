            <p>[Music] episode yep and today we&#x27;re wrapping up our spooky content for October with our most requested topic probably of all time people have asked us to talk about this a long time for a very long time today we are talking about the very creepy skinwalker ranch oh yes I&#x27;m so excited for this one because yeah you wouldn&#x27;t do all this stuff is right up my alley as far as interests and I know you&#x27;re super interested in this stuff too because there&#x27;s actually a lot of different things going on with skinwalker - all things paranormal really so that is what we are diving into today and we have also got some super interesting news topics for you as well but before we get into those things I first want to of course thank our sponsors for today&#x27;s snow post mates ritual and stitch fix for sponsoring today&#x27;s episode then I also wanted to mention we have new merch dropping on Halloween yes and it&#x27;s very cool stuff yeah we&#x27;re super excited about it we switched merch like suppliers and things like that so the quality is way better it&#x27;s completely different totally new stuff but the only difference is we&#x27;re buying limited quantities this time like we&#x27;re you know buying and then selling until it sells out so if you want something you got to get on it quick exact things will sell out we will see we bought pretty limited quantities just to see how it goes with this first room so if you want something from the initial launch make sure you know you get on the thirty-first of it we actually changed the site it&#x27;s mile higher calm instead of mile higher merch calm but either way it&#x27;ll still get you to the right spot but you can go there and you can still get 10% if you sign up early for that numerous drop with the code mile higher so definitely check that out well yeah let&#x27;s go ahead and jump in today&#x27;s news topic so the first story we&#x27;ve got is good news yeah I hate starting out these shows with bad news all the time I know this is a great story actually the real house just unanimously passed a bill making animal cruelty a federal felony which a lot of you probably like thought it already was but it&#x27;s not there was no federal law no to enforce animal cruelty across the board right you know there&#x27;s state laws but that&#x27;s different than a federal law yeah and it just varied and I&#x27;m sure a lot of times they weren&#x27;t even enforced to the fullest degree you know like mm-hmm you know I&#x27;ve watched a lot of shows there&#x27;s you know a lot of [ __ ] I think there&#x27;s like a show on Animal Planet actually that&#x27;s about yeah um you know fish game wardens the animal control people and stuff who investigate these types of crimes animal cruelty crimes in a lot of times that people end up getting like a slap on the wrist or fines even just some fines like there it&#x27;s not like people are actively going to jail all the time for serious animal cruelty um so now it&#x27;s a federal offense which takes it up to a whole nother level definitely so this law would literally make it a serious federal crime for quote-unquote any person to intentionally engage in the crushing burning drowning suffocating and impaling of animals yeah along with other acts of intentional animal cruelty toward non-human mammals as well birds reptiles or amphibians that&#x27;s that&#x27;s another thing too is like this extends beyond just mammals and it goes to reptiles birds and amphibians which is cool as well so all pets are protected yeah that&#x27;s really really cool to see this happening on a federal level yeah and it&#x27;s bipartisan too which is cool yes the government&#x27;s actually getting together and doing some useful [ __ ] horns yeah I mean you&#x27;d think everyone would care about animals need hope but there&#x27;s a lot of people out there who don&#x27;t it&#x27;s pretty shocking it&#x27;s just upsetting to think about what people will do to their animals to hear all these horrible terms and paling suffocating the fact that anyone can do this it was so shocking to me yeah and before it was like you know you could do that kind of [ __ ] you know there was people that were making videos yeah things like fetish porn yeah exhausting animals yeah which I just came believer it exists in the first place but yep because but now if you&#x27;re doing that kind of [ __ ] you know you could be prosecuted I remember there was a whole YouTube channel back in the day before they really cracked out and like monetizing it was nothing just kind of like anything [ __ ] went on YouTube there was some channel those just crushing a bunch of small animals like frogs and stuff and letting things into the street to see I arm or that you shop yeah oh my gosh that was so long it was really bad yeah if really freaked people out so they finally didn&#x27;t know the content that was on it yeah so finally enough people like yeah removed but yeah there was this whole channel he&#x27;d like we&#x27;re like I think it was a man that would wear high heels or cowboy boots and like crush a bunch of different things they get like frogs and yeah little burdens and like people would get off on it it&#x27;s so bizarre why the [ __ ] you want to do that in the first place I just understand this I guess it&#x27;s not you know why do people want to like hurt humans too you know like some people are just they have no regard for life in general and or why do you get off on that yeah I know it&#x27;s shocking it really is cuz the hell an animals just as much of a living being as any one of us you know like would you go and crush and impale a human I think some people just don&#x27;t see animals that way they&#x27;re just an object which which I mean I understand like the argument would be like well what about people that hunt and do things like that and it&#x27;s like you know is how is that different that&#x27;s cruel in a sense cuz you&#x27;re killing my animal but is it really that much different from somebody you know we&#x27;re talking crushing burning drowning suffocating and paling yeah what about shooting you know you&#x27;re obtaining an animal with a bullet yeah so you know could that be under the same pain no I&#x27;m just I&#x27;m just saying I&#x27;m thinking about it&#x27;s an interesting argument but I think one thing is a cruel like it&#x27;s not considered cool to be a hunter that&#x27;s a good point yeah I mean I&#x27;m not saying anything against hunters I mean you know I&#x27;ve known plenty of my life but you know it&#x27;s just where does where do you draw the line you know like if it&#x27;s a felony to do that how is that much different from somebody that is going out into nature and shooting a bird versus I impale a bird with a stick for fun I think I&#x27;m hunting an animal is different than torturing an animal right but you right but intentionally engage in these acts it doesn&#x27;t say torture so it&#x27;s just killing the animal in some way shape or form so if like that&#x27;s kind of weird the wording at least is weird like I feel like they gotta figure that out because I think some animal rights people might go and yeah I think there is definitely like still work to be done and I mean you can go into like how we treat you know like breeding animals and stuff and just yeah exactly animal testing factory farming should always do farming serious yeah you want to talk about animal cruelty yeah you want to talk about which i think is so interesting that this and i think it&#x27;s great that this exists don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m all for it however I think it&#x27;s interesting that we as a society you&#x27;re able to be like woohoo for like our you know at-home pets but all these animals that we don&#x27;t eat wives da cheese yeah huge quantity and we eat it you know commercially it&#x27;s like oh we just kind of turn our heads cuz their food it&#x27;s like when do we draw the line because there&#x27;s other cultures that really worship those animals totally and we&#x27;ll eat dogs or something and we&#x27;re over here and we think it&#x27;s you know we would never think of doing that so I know it&#x27;s really interestingly you ask a person depending on where they are in the world or what their situation is aware they were brought up and they see animals over what you can do completely different like everyone is such a different take on it mm-hm yeah it&#x27;s it&#x27;s getting tricky though it&#x27;s good and tricky hard to write laws around it but it&#x27;s so good to see that they did this definitely great to see yeah cuz that means a good start it&#x27;s a good start with going after people that are just doing evil [ __ ] to animals and yeah you know or people just totally it seems like we should have like done this a long time ago but you know no it&#x27;s good and we&#x27;re making some progress that&#x27;s good yes yes exactly so this next story is something that we&#x27;ve talked about a couple times on the on the show before specifically around Tom DeLonge and it really kind of fits good into her topic for today so Tom DeLonge we&#x27;ve talked about many times he has this to the Stars Academy which is an aerospace company um that claims to have alien materials and actually we&#x27;ve heard him kind of talk about this before mom on the Joe Rogan Papa Joe Rogan podcast yeah um so they&#x27;ve like pretty much confirmed that he has this type of material to metal and as far as we know it&#x27;s not from Earth and it is not element it&#x27;s not element 115 we it&#x27;s nothing yeah it&#x27;s not an element that we have synthesized in a lab yet so like with at 1:15 they happened they had the raw but then they went to a lab and were able to chemically recreate it so this is something that we eat is unidentifiable we don&#x27;t know what it is it could very well be from another planet or you know what&#x27;s he gonna do with something else well what&#x27;s interesting is that you know we they have all these mil ex-military guys and scientists and things like that and they already are teaming up with the US Army actually with this really the Army and the Department of Defense have already reached out to to the stars which is why there&#x27;s a lot of skepticism around his company and because my government cuz he has so many government people that is this really like cuz this whole thing is like we want to bring this technology to the people we&#x27;re gonna bring disclosure and do all this you know as far as out exactly we&#x27;re gonna reveal the truth about everything to the public um through our company but it&#x27;s interesting he&#x27;s teaming up with the army to research this material that he has and the Army&#x27;s hoping that they can use this alien material or metal to their advantage and like put it on their vehicles and things like that like maybe it&#x27;s like this indestructible metal that bullets can&#x27;t pierce or you know bombs can&#x27;t impact and it&#x27;s interesting that they&#x27;re openly talking about this you&#x27;d think they wouldn&#x27;t want to keep the fact that they&#x27;re I&#x27;m gonna look into that a secret right well that&#x27;s the other thing too is like why are they just telling all of us this yeah you know is it really what they say it is mm-hmm but the history of this metal and we&#x27;re taught because it&#x27;s like where the hell did Tom DeLonge blink-182 do Happy&#x27;s alien exact aerial and that&#x27;s what makes you a little skeptical especially when you don&#x27;t really know his history I think when you see an article like Tom DeLonge claims he has this medal you know a lot of people are like really show us then yeah any heavy exactly like showed us proof or you know what it can do but this material that he has apparently started with art bell which if you don&#x27;t know who art Bell is he&#x27;s a really legend legendary you know kind of paranormal UFO Coast to Coast AM radio host who was on the radio for a long time talking about all this stuff and apparently he had it and he claims that this material is from the Roswell crash ah which is interesting and very possible that it is like it&#x27;s very possible they claimed that something was recovered at the site they claimed a craft was recovered from the site so could this metal be from this a potential extraterrestrial craft it&#x27;s interesting so yeah we&#x27;ll have to wait and see what you know comes next but it&#x27;s interesting that they&#x27;re confirming that they have this material and that they&#x27;re going to start studying it and figuring out what it can be used for and the military is very interested in this so this last story though you guys a lot of you were sending us this from across the pond many this is crazy it really is this is very weird yeah so like last Wednesday morning first responders in the county of Essex in the UK made a horrifying discovery when they found a container truck with 39 bodies inside 13 died oh yes so many imagine being the person who found that yeah 39 38 were adults and one was a teenager oh that&#x27;s so scary and what&#x27;s interesting is they&#x27;ve already as of today I believe are the last day or two charged the truck driver with 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people they charged him today connection yeah it&#x27;s a dated filming this it&#x27;s an update yeah interesting so is it the same guy that they initially says did it so he really did do really dead he drove this truck in in there connecting it and there&#x27;s four other people have been arrested I knew that the details would get straightened out because everyone was super confused when this happened on Wednesday because at first you know they sent out the picture of the guy to everyone and then there was a bunch of people that were like on Twitter like don&#x27;t stop sharing this guy&#x27;s picture he&#x27;s not actually the killer he didn&#x27;t do it he just picked up the truck 30 minutes before he&#x27;s all disturbed poor guy and then the conversation turned to that so now they&#x27;re finding out that he actually did on this case is that the police are charging him with 39 counts oh damn and that this is the one of the biggest human trafficking cases in UK is human trafficking Wow the people are from Asia did he so did he murder them or what did they accidentally die some way in the truck yeah I believe it was well that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s manslaughter not murder he was something happened either they got too hot they&#x27;re doing autopsy don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re doing autopsies on all seem like just the victims to try to figure out how each of them died so that they can you know determine uh I don&#x27;t think he said or admitted or I don&#x27;t I don&#x27;t really think they know that much as far as his involvement with it but I know that they&#x27;re charging him with 39 counts of manslaughter I wonder if he was just transporting these rebel though or did he actually kill them is he a serial killer no there&#x27;s three other or four other people involved with this that&#x27;s some type of ring and something really was wrong and they died right after Keita door froze or overheated or something something happened yeah or hopefully it wasn&#x27;t like starvation or something evil or no I don&#x27;t know 39 people all died of starvation yeah it&#x27;s true it must have been something maybe it was even like a chemical leak in the or like an exhaust week or something like that yeah Harvin dancing yeah carbon monoxide yeah I mean yeah sorry yeah I pretty much want to see every science class I ever took so don&#x27;t really know the difference yeah what if they just ran out of well if they run out of oxygen yeah cuz there were so many of them in there yeah that&#x27;s true thirty nine people on the trailer for who knows how long I mean they they&#x27;re logged in my guess is that they my Jesse&#x27;s I think picked him up from or no I keep forgetting this is [ __ ] crazy but there&#x27;s a tunnel that runs under the ocean from England to the main mainland of Europe it came from Bulgaria so the truck was driving from Bulgaria under that could be part of it too they had literally had a drive in that underground tunnel for a long time you know what does that kill you though no but I&#x27;m just saying like maybe they didn&#x27;t they ran out of oxygen like if you think about it maybe though Trek was so long in a confined space that they ran out of oxygen I mean that&#x27;s totally possible because if you think about it if they knew you know it&#x27;d be a parent if it was something else like if they got shot or something or if there&#x27;s blood yeah anyway you know right away and it would like this is murder but it&#x27;s more sounds like an accidental yeah you know you trafficking oh my god just wild it&#x27;ll be interesting to see as the details come out I&#x27;m sure a lot more informations gonna come out this was a big story it was another thing that they released too as well is that a lot of these people are from Vietnam there&#x27;s a lot of Vietnamese people that are being in this human trafficking that are actually missing persons back in Vietnam so this is a I&#x27;m pretty sure you know that this is a full on human trafficking operation that big groups of people like that writing in ours that&#x27;s what it is crazy though because it&#x27;s I feel like it&#x27;s so rare that we actually like catch some of this stuff happening unfortunately it was too late for this this group of people that imagine being the first officer on the scene though oh my god oh my god you imagine open the back of that and Oh terribly just terrible yeah really sad stuff but yeah we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see what happens from here and you know if they need more information comes out in this investigation because this is an ongoing active thing because there&#x27;s clearly like where these people come from who&#x27;s involved with that yeah how why are they coming from hey who&#x27;s where are they going once they get to the UK yeah what are people people like well this could lead to some pretty big busts they could find his driver and stuff like maybe they could probably well they probably well get him they like give up who&#x27;s up the chain because I be surprised if he was like the end all guy that went and got them there&#x27;s no he&#x27;s definitely working for some G&#x27;s that are way higher up yeah just crazy though when the the cold evil reality of human trafficking I know no comes to the surface okay so a lot of people are just shocked by it when they hear stories that because they don&#x27;t realize this is really happening on such a grand scale and probably all over the US as well I mean they&#x27;re so yeah it makes you think about these tractor-trailers though and these big trucks driving you know there&#x27;s like what the hell&#x27;s in the baby I know people in there like I literally think about that all the time I know it&#x27;s something that felt like the Highway Patrol&#x27;s are being you know taught to look at is actually investigate some of these trucks because it happens more often than not yeah you know not only like illegal immigrants coming across but human trafficking victims and stuff so it&#x27;s really crazy stuff it is so let&#x27;s go ahead and jump into skinwalker ranch cuz we got a lot of ground to cover but before we do we&#x27;d like to

skinwalker yeah I hate it I know this place is supposedly the most active diverse paranormal hotspot in the world to many who have studied the paranormal the hotspot is commonly known as skinwalker ranch but it&#x27;s also known by other names such as Sherman ranch or UFO ranch for decades people have claimed to have encountered all kinds of strange phenomena in this area of Utah it&#x27;s literally in the middle of nowhere desert Utah and a lot of paranormal stuff comes out of Utah yeah I kinda like Midwest of the United States can a lot of paranormal activity totally totally like Utah New Mexico Colorado there&#x27;s a lot of paranormal activity which is interesting because of the Native American aspect to it which we&#x27;ll talk about in a sec but it&#x27;s very interesting there&#x27;s been all sorts of reports specially of UFOs it&#x27;s like the number one thing with this area of Utah in skinwalker ranch actually it&#x27;s not necessarily the skinwalkers which is you know hence the name but it&#x27;s really about the UFOs people have encountered potentially aliens interdimensional beings portals shadowy entities and of course just lots of like poltergeists haunted activity at this location so skinwalker ranch is 480 acres and it&#x27;s located near the small towns of Ballard and 4 Chesney Utah and it borders a you Indian Reservation so to put that into perspective for those who have never been to Utah or maybe even know what Utah is it&#x27;s essentially the capital of Utah in Salt Lake City so it&#x27;s three hours east of Salt Lake City or it&#x27;s only six hour drive for us to drive to skinwalker ranch you want to go yeah maybe one day we should go yeah seriously yeah my heart trip to skinwalker in that would be crazy yeah we should wonder what we would see kind of scared it&#x27;s pretty creepy yeah yeah there&#x27;s a lot of freaky stuff going on there but it&#x27;s really not that far I was kind of surprised too when I typed that into Google is like only six hours damn let&#x27;s make a trip out there so this area for more than 150 years the you Indians have lived here on a reservation that covers 4.5 million acres and they&#x27;ve long said that the ranch is quote unquote on the path of the skinwalker and for that very reason they will not go anywhere near the ranch so according to legend a skinwalker is a evil shape-shifting witch of the Navajo people which the you people take very seriously clearly because they are very scared of this they really believe in it they do and the reason why this is even a thing is that before the you people actually moved to the reservation they were of course fierce warriors who lived primarily in the region of Utah Colorado New Mexico and at one time these two tribes the youths of the Navajos actually fought together against their common enemies on white people you know coming West and taking their land so for a while they teamed up against that but then eventually you know a lot of times the tribes had to in order to better their situation kind of work with the enemy in a sense and that&#x27;s exactly what the Utes did because they actually got horses from the Spanish and then they began to abduct Navajo people and they would sell them in New Mexico slave markets geez so crazy kind of turning against you know your own in a sense I mean they&#x27;re a different tribe but yeah at the same time it&#x27;s like damn yeah I didn&#x27;t know they would be that savage towards each other yeah exactly and then later on during the Civil War some of the you warriors teamed up with Kit Carson in a military campaign against not drive so literally helped Kit Carson in and the military take from the Navajo trot and because of this this ended up with the Navajo being exiled from their lands and forced to march to a reservation and forced Sumner New Mexico known as a long walk of the Navajos very famous the result of the Utes teaming up with Kit Carson essentially ended with the Navajo being exiled from their lands and forced to march to a reservation in Fort Sumner New Mexico which this event was also known as a long walk of the Navajo so eventually the Navajo tribe was allowed to return to their homelands in the Four Corners area which is somewhere I&#x27;d definitely like to check out because you can stand in four states at once if you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s kind of cool people always take pictures you know like yeah I mean I remember like kids in school taking pictures there and bringing them into class even though like with the [ __ ] States you know it&#x27;s just like imaginary lines yeah but because they you know of these things that the Utes did to the Navajos they believe that they put a curse on them and that literally after they cursed them this is when the skinwalker started to play the you people so they believe that this has been going on for a long long time like 15 generations that there&#x27;s these beings / animals that are roaming this area and essentially they feed off of life yeah they kill and they feed off that life and that&#x27;s how they survive and they&#x27;re called skin walkers because they&#x27;re wearing the skins of the animals that they run into but they&#x27;re walking around like normally exactly day exactly which makes sense and then the thing with it too is that it&#x27;s not like specific to these just two tribes like skinwalkers is kind of a general a generalized mythological creature in a sense because a lot of different tribes talk about it and a lot of different cultures actually essentially they believe that it&#x27;s a medicine man or woman who commits a terrible act such as killing a relative in order to gain supernatural power so it&#x27;s kind of yeah there&#x27;s somebody that has these powers but they use it for evil essentially they did a deal with the devil exactly yeah in a lot of ways if they believe in the devil but what they do is they can shape-shift into the whatever animal they need to be so if they need to run fast they turn into a wolf if they want to fly an owl crow you know so whatever it depending on what the time yeah whatever purpose it need to do they can just change into that animal they&#x27;re also known to knock on doors bang on walls peer through windows attack livestock and harass unsuspecting humans by appearing and disappearing so there&#x27;s not really any good ones they pretty much all wreak havoc yeah that&#x27;s an evil evil entity pretty much and so skinwalkers have been seen by the you people a number of different times and they believe that they live in this area and you talk called the dark canyon and there it&#x27;s like all these look they kind of live in these caves and things like that but then they come and run around and one of the ways that you know like if you see a wolf out there it might look a little different but if you look into their eyes they have like these human eyes apparently and they glow red and things like that so really freaky stuff so the thing with skinwalkers is that we don&#x27;t know 100% whether or not they&#x27;re real right because there&#x27;s not really any pictures of them there&#x27;s definitely in the legend category yeah very much so and I mean there&#x27;s of course people that have captured photos but they&#x27;re blurry and stuff and they look like just a regular wolf a lot of times they&#x27;ve been compared to the extinct dire wolf like they&#x27;re just a lot bigger they just look a little bit different but Utah has wolves so you know the debate is like are we actually seeing skinwalkers or are we just seeing you know normal wolves and other types of animals that are running around is this picture in a regular wolf this is a dire wolf a dire wolf yeah how are you looking yeah or like if you remember from Game of Thrones they have the dire wolves as well oh right they&#x27;re like really really big I&#x27;ll give you everything about a human sized wolf it would be like a dire wolf because very likely yeah human-like faces right exactly so that&#x27;s what a lot of people say is they look like these larger-than-life wolves in a way so maybe people could have been seeing those right exactly so there&#x27;s these skinwalkers and that&#x27;s just one part of this whole skinwalker ranch story and it&#x27;s kind of like honestly the most my new thing about it like it&#x27;s really not that big of a thing like the ute people and the you know tribes people that live in the area 100% believe that this is the evil force that&#x27;s running around causing havoc and all this crazy paranormal activity at the ranch but in reality there could be a lot of other things that are going on so what&#x27;s interesting is that the earliest mention of unexplained phenomena in this region that Utah actually goes all the way back to the late 1700s Spanish explorers as you know they were exploring America we&#x27;re looking for the Spanish Trail and passed right through the unit ah basin and reported seeing craft in the sky over their campfires at night they literally recorded that they saw UFOs in the sky in this area imagine seeing it back then because you can&#x27;t justify it as anything else it can&#x27;t be an airplane or something else like it&#x27;d be so out of the norm back then yeah and you would a hundred percent sure yeah and you would 100% want to write that [ __ ] down oh yeah what the hell is that it&#x27;s none of that an animal what&#x27;s what are these like light orbs in the sky flying around so this was the earliest reports of phenomena at skinwalker ranch but jumping forward to sort of the you know the modern history around it skinwalker ranch was first homesteaded by the Myers family in 1905 and it consisted of only a few small buildings as most homesteads had at the time and eventually they abandoned that homestead and created a new home on the other side of the ranch it was like when you first homesteaded your priority was like get up a little house to live in and then like maybe a couple buildings for livestock and things like that but then over time they were able to create another house and by the 1930s the ranch was occupied by Kenneth John Myers and his wife Edith child Myers and lived up the ranch until 1987 so they actually lived in this area at this ranch for a very long time what&#x27;s interesting is that they never reported anything strange right they didn&#x27;t see anything or they didn&#x27;t far as well no they yeah I mean as far as we know they could have seen [ __ ] and they just didn&#x27;t say anything but they never said anything to anybody is and that&#x27;s up to 1987 so it&#x27;s not like it was so far long ago that maybe they said something just nobody knew so it seems like well I feel like when you see stuff like that if you do see it you don&#x27;t often tell people or a lot of people don&#x27;t worry because they don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re gonna be believed anyway right that&#x27;s a good point or you know from the skeptics perspective this is proof that maybe nothing is really happening here at all and they didn&#x27;t see possible to death cuz you know the next people that move in have totally different experience yeah and just through the like 1950s just this whole area of Utah UFO reports were just rampant like there were so many UFO reports literally in the hundreds and it included different reports of strange fireballs and aircrafts they range in size from 20 and 30 feet across to as large as a football sealed feet sealed field literally flying in the sky above them like oh my god in the 50s - so technologies yeah has it come that far in the 50s - see definitely not you can&#x27;t like oh maybe that was a military plane yeah exactly oh it&#x27;s just a top-secret government stuff Wow cuz I mean if you think about UFOs and sever Oswald didn&#x27;t happen till you know late nineteen forty seven eight or whatever right around 1950 so people didn&#x27;t really know about UFOs or you know have any clue what they were seeing in the sky but reports were coming in of different types of craft they would see round oval cigar shaped and triangular craft that&#x27;s all during the cigar shape again oval and triangle yeah there&#x27;s I mean there&#x27;s Laura I think we always fall into those categories which is interesting because it&#x27;s like mmm you know what does that mean is it you know do these aliens just sound like a bunch of different maybe it&#x27;s different it&#x27;s kind of like how we have different power models yeah yeah are different like species have different grafter yeah well I mean maybe they&#x27;re not all from the same place yeah different different systems some of these UFOs though were surrounded by glowing green lights and others would emit wavy red beam and others would disappear to shoot colored lights from underneath that&#x27;s like a pretty common thing with UFOs as weird odd lights coming from them and beams of light coming down to the ground and things like that but imagine seeing that kind of stuff back in the time you know back in the fifties and stuff how crazy just like you would you know it would be something you&#x27;d remember it&#x27;s not something where I&#x27;d be like oh maybe that was just a plane or just a helicopter flying around or something like it probably was some type of it&#x27;s UFO yeah exactly um in fact in the 1970s the Utah Highway Patrol is getting so many calls about UFOs that they stopped filling out incident reports on them that&#x27;s how many were coming in in Utah they couldn&#x27;t even keep up with it know what&#x27;s interesting though is at the same time that all these UFO reports are coming in they were also starting to get reports of bizarre cattle mutilations and this is where you know the two really became associated because there was so many cattle mutilations that were unexplainable we had no you know other than maybe it&#x27;s something natural maybe these car you know cows are being picked apart by predators and things like that but oftentimes with these cattle mutilations literally the incisions are medical grade incisions to the point where you&#x27;re like there&#x27;s no way any predators not you know carving out an 8 8 inch core into the back of a rectum of a cow ya know there&#x27;s no sense yeah like in no blood yeah what a predator is gonna come up to a carcass and rip it apart most likely in their blood and you know [ __ ] everywhere but oftentimes they&#x27;re clean no yeah like a human did it or something yeah really weird what&#x27;s also interesting though about all these UFO reports is in a lot of the reports actually people would report seeing actual beings and like the actual little portal windows on the UFOs themselves interesting we could actually see who is like driving yeah like they would see the living entities body sometimes I think they have like tinted windows and why would they just be like hey like looking out their window you know that&#x27;s interesting you don&#x27;t always hear that with a UFO report seeing the actual driver yeah the beings inside of the spacecraft yeah well like one of the most fame cases of alien abduction is Betty on Barney Hill yes and they reported seeing aliens in the windows and things like that as well so this is it&#x27;s interesting because it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re all these people just imagining saying things or were they actually seeing some type of living being in these UFO crafts I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s crazy it&#x27;d be hard to remember because you&#x27;re I mean you&#x27;re so shocked when you see something like that right and like the human memory is already bad as it is especially in like high adrenaline situations you lose even more of your ability to recall details totally so like no it&#x27;s hard to it&#x27;s hard to trust those eyewitness if I witness accounts because it&#x27;s like every woman have a different idea of what happened if multiple people saw it you know mm-hmm the details of the craft yeah I don&#x27;t know man but then oh but then again I&#x27;m like why you know why aren&#x27;t we having all these reports now like why is it like slowed down so much or like yeah why aren&#x27;t people seeing all the same stuff now like why they uh did the aliens just like stop or maybe they do and people report it and it goes hushed pretty quickly there you go could be so after the Myers family moved out of skinwalker ranch in 1987 it actually stood empty for seven years before being purchased by Terry and Gwen Sherman in 1994 they also I&#x27;ve seen in publications their last name be Gorman as well but it&#x27;s Sherman and so this couple moved into the ranch with their two children and livestock and they have really expensive cows Angus cattle like Angus beef these are very expensive thousands of dollars per cow because it&#x27;s Angus beef right so it&#x27;s pretty expensive stuff and what&#x27;s interesting though is when they moved into the house they were surprised to find that the previous owners had placed deadbolt locks on all the doors and windows including those inside Wow why was heard this is like a huge thing it&#x27;s like why was there dead bolts inside and outside what were they talking aremy if I moved into a new house and the owner had locked themselves every very much everything so cabinets - Wow they have deadbolts on all the doors cabinets what reason well clearly there are some paranormal activity in this house and doors are slamming things are moving and you know the because of this paranormal activity the people are like we got to figure out how to stop this we&#x27;re gonna deadbolt everything not only that but they could be dead building to keep themselves safe from something trying to get into them did they not see this house beforehand and see all the dead bolts these stores are was so weird they never like make sense well I think they got a good deal it&#x27;s sat vacant for seven years and there are a cattle rancher and so there&#x27;s only so many cows ranches out there right gonna be picky about your cattle ranch that&#x27;s true but people are skeptical too because it&#x27;s not like they moved to like the best place to raising is cattle - or talking like a very desert e area and like lots of predators out there not a ton of like pasture you know it&#x27;s not great pasture for for cattle so mmm you know they pick that you know maybe they cuz you know you&#x27;re always they have to question people&#x27;s intentions when this paranormal stuff because you you know it&#x27;s very easy to fake and make up stories with this and that people really you know kind of get really skeptical with this story because of the fact that they moved in here and like you just said why didn&#x27;t they check to see you know yeah they really wanted all this and you know they didn&#x27;t care if their cows had the best pasture but on the flip side it was affordable it was vacant for seven years so maybe was just a good deal and they&#x27;re like hey yeah I&#x27;ll take it some people do that mm-hmm but this is like even more and this kind of gives gives away a little bit too is that at both ends of the house there&#x27;s iron stakes and heavy chains that have been installed which the Sherman&#x27;s guests were used by the previous tenants for large guard dogs so they had like they had literally like fencing around the house what chains they wouldn&#x27;t they wouldn&#x27;t let their dogs leave like close to the house essentially like they keep him chained up because they were worried about something snatching their dogs well isn&#x27;t that just smart to do I mean whether or not it&#x27;s skinwalkers you&#x27;re worried about when she just be worried about random animals snatching your dogs true it&#x27;s very true where you&#x27;re worried about something you know because I mean a lot of ranchers have like big dogs like you know we got a pyrénées like a lot of people have big dogs that they&#x27;re not worried about being eaten by something and on a ranch write what you know the this raises suspicion because maybe there is something in the area that they&#x27;re especially worried about so they built all these fences and chains and steaks and to keep something out there yeah yeah exactly because literally the day that they moved into this ranch and as they were unpacking they spotted an enormous coyote or wolf in one of their pastures and strangely this animal approached them and they begin petting it what yeah I would what just sounds insam like what come on like really you see a giant wolf come walking towards me like hey buddy good boy scratch monitor-chan you know what that makes it knows that this story is already sounding scheduled yeah skeptic meters going a little bit so yeah so they&#x27;re petting it and they even remember saying the creature just smelled like a wet dog l1 but after a few minutes of stroking its back the wolf wandered over to the livestock pen and grabbed a calf by the nose Jo one of the cows yeah by the nose like one of the baby cows by its nose trying to rip it through the fence oh that&#x27;s scary a big-ass wolf can you imagine how like scary and horrifying that would be to watch like goddamn and Terry Sherman the father or the the guy and his father went over and start beating on the animal to try to get it to release the cat yeah and it wouldn&#x27;t of course so Terry took out his 357 Magnum pistol shot the wolf at point-blank range but it would not let go and he continued to shoot it and eventually it released the calf but it didn&#x27;t run it just stood there watching the family so they&#x27;re like what the [ __ ] why isn&#x27;t the same running off so they just keep shooting at it but there&#x27;s no sand like hitting it yeah clearly I mean point-blank and stuff two things should be like in almost dead by now this is according to them right according to them there&#x27;s no blood no sign of injury and it&#x27;s just kind of chilling there and slowly starting to back off not worried about it at all tricycle II so then Terry goes and grabs his hunting rifle and shoots the animal again at point-blank range and finally the bullet apparently took a piece of the skin and hair off of the animal and it was still calm it was like still just kind of chilling there like not scared not really like trying to run away or anything like that um but eventually after just continuing to shoot at it it started to just kind of walk off casually into the pasture into what brushy area and he says that he tracked it and went after it was obviously gonna try to kill it he&#x27;s just about if I don&#x27;t know if he killed its calf or not but it&#x27;ll come back it&#x27;ll come back exactly if it knows that there&#x27;s food there and apparently this thing smelled really weird and the piece of hair that came off of it from shooting it smelled like really foul like rotting meat combined with a musky fox scent like it was kind of a really bizarre weird smell to it and why did they pet this thing well I walked up to and it reeks and looks horrible and they&#x27;re like what&#x27;s pettish yeah well I think well yeah I don&#x27;t know why you do not ask them I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;ve pet the thing it&#x27;s cute so they I&#x27;m assuming that this is a skinwalker because it&#x27;s invincible you can shoot it and it does not die and it&#x27;s a skinwalker in its animal form as I believe kind of the what many believe if you believe that the story is true and he believed in skinwalkers then this wolf could have potentially been a skinwalker which is why it didn&#x27;t die why didn&#x27;t it attack them they don&#x27;t just get because it&#x27;s a skinwalker and skinwalkers don&#x27;t don&#x27;t actually attack you know attack humans I guess not I don&#x27;t know so that&#x27;s the thing by here conflicting stuff with that here&#x27;s okay attacks I&#x27;m so hard to do research on these legend type stories it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s so hard to do everything on account of it yeah there&#x27;s completely different versions so based oh yeah I mean based upon what I&#x27;ve seen about coming from like the the actual Indians themselves is that this is they do not attack humans and they feast on animals and things like that but then I&#x27;ve seen other you know the other side of that too yeah well what was interesting is one of the other first signs that they saw at this ranch was that there was really large crop circles in their pastures like there is straight off the bat crops certain they found crop circles which is an indication that there&#x27;s some type of something pairing alone what could crop circles be if they&#x27;re not aliens like do you ever have any other ideas of what it could be could it be some type of alien or something paranormal or a ghost creating crop circles maybe is there any other real like decent theory for what they could be other than extraterrestrials or people yeah yeah I&#x27;ll keep that&#x27;s a [ __ ] theory some of these crop circles are insanely beautiful and the intricate detail massive yeah it would take you days to build that yeah it makes no sense not like oh six hours in the middle of the night and then all the sudden I come out in there virtually perfect too like every angle is like you know symmetrical it&#x27;s perfect it&#x27;s not really interesting so it&#x27;s like this this paranormal stuff is happening in the area but also well I guess UFO has fallen to paranormal as well but is it is it like the spirit world and the UFO world like colliding in this space that pull all of it&#x27;s connected to skinwalker ranch yeah interesting it&#x27;s a paranormal hotspot meaning it&#x27;s all things paranormal are happening in this area so when you think about that you have to think about well what&#x27;s the energy like there there&#x27;s some type of stronger you know geomagnetic something going there&#x27;s something else happening like connected more than we understand it could be absolutely very interesting to think about well I mean I think I think the simplest explanation is that these UFOs are creating crop circles and especially in that&#x27;s what makes the most sense when you look at actually look into the details of crop circles we should talk about crop circles sometime soon we should was an actual video um that is as far as I know authentic that&#x27;s very old that shows a circular craft creating crop circles in front of our eyes during the skinwalker no no not skin this is a crop circle and I believe in in England at some point but there&#x27;s a famous radio yeah I think I remember so we I think we know I mean as far as I guess as far as we know that that&#x27;s real that these UFOs are the ones creating these crops so what about the crop circles that were here are there any photos or documentation of them at the ones that skinwalker ranch see that&#x27;s the thing with it is that there is pictures and stuff but it&#x27;s all super blurry I mean we&#x27;re talking the 90s and stuff and like there just wasn&#x27;t and that&#x27;s what sucks about a lot of this is that you know no one why can&#x27;t we have today&#x27;s technology back then when all this [ __ ] was happening so we can see I have a [ __ ] drone seriously good shot of the crop circle but yeah I mean apparently there was a some type of crop circle well that wasn&#x27;t a crop circle but it was like a 30-foot triangle that was carved out that&#x27;s interesting the triangle but I think for the most part with skinwalker ranch it was a lot of like smaller circles as they found yeah they found like eye circles just really in circle not like intricate designs that you see in England and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so interesting is that sometimes that crop circles in the US are very like much simpler than in England maybe all the fancy aliens all the trash ones come to America yeah there&#x27;s like some yeah some real proper aliens and then there&#x27;s some just you know backwoods once though yeah like God but in like these eye circles can be explained by natural causes - and and that&#x27;s what kind of the thing with all this is like there&#x27;s kind of a natural explanation - a lot of us even with cattle mutilations if you think about that for a second you know you see pictures of Calla mutilations in it&#x27;s very gruesome it looks crazy but then when you actually look at what&#x27;s happened to the animal and often time it&#x27;s all the really fleshy areas that get eaten or you know removed first and you know yeah something could in there and removed an eyeball but at the same time a crow could co pick out an eyeball as well so people are definitely able to make that argument right exactly because they&#x27;re you know with anything paranormal that&#x27;s yeah there&#x27;s tons of skepticism around it because that&#x27;s good though like that&#x27;s how you do I know truth by being skeptical of things until you are sure and I really confirm it yeah yeah and there&#x27;s just not great evidence and I mean the schurmans said that not only them but their neighbors as well reported seeing a number of strange animals in the area including exotic multicolored birds not native to the region interesting which one I think of that I think of like a macaw parrot or something like yeah flying around in the middle of the Utah desert like something weird or like a Phoenix which is really out flying around and then of course Sasquatch or Bigfoot oh they see that there too people have reported in this area that they have had encounters there&#x27;s this one guy that says he had an encounter with a Bigfoot in this area which is interesting because if that&#x27;s the case is it potentially that Bigfoot you know has something to do with the energy in this area maybe they&#x27;re drawn to it or maybe that&#x27;s the only place where they can survive is when you know the electromagnetic energy stronger there&#x27;s got to be something cuz no reason why is that why is there where you know why are there three why are there these hot spots yeah at all on one occasion actually the Sherman saw strange hyena like creature attacking one of their horses and which they described low to the ground heavily muscled weighing perhaps 200 pounds with curly red hair and a bushy tail interesting yeah and as he approached the animal it vanished right before his eyes and afterward he checked the horse and found numerous claw marks on the legs and then a few months later a neighbor reported seeing a similar beast running across their property and this is a picture of I believe the animal that they&#x27;re talking about it just looks like a coyote though it looks like big one I was running around our yard today no no it&#x27;s much bigger the scale of this photograph doesn&#x27;t really do it justice but there&#x27;s a it&#x27;s definitely a little bit larger than I think it looks but yeah I mean it could be a coyote but look at that you know there&#x27;s I guess it kinda has a tail to it so yeah I mean this could just be a Utah wolf what&#x27;s a lot of people like this is just a wolf like this is nothing special am i I mean maybe maybe not exactly so we don&#x27;t know for sure but I want to talk a little bit more in depth about some of these UFO sightings that they saw because this is kind of one of the main and most frightening experiences that they had at the ranch while they lived there but before we talk about that I wanted to quickly thank our last sponsors for today so our next sponsor is stitch fix and this is one of my favorite

object pass over a 50-foot tall bunch of poplar trees on the edge of one of his fields what kind of trees poplar poplar poplar trees yeah there&#x27;s poplar trees poplar wood hmm never heard of that never heard of that look up like popular yeah except without the you power poplar yeah Oh new new facts every day you know yeah it&#x27;s nice wood actually I used to make a poplar derby cars Boy Scouts shut up you did not no I seriously did poplar derby car yeah poplar would look it up it like yeah we had the derby race you so every year you make little derby cars and you race them and I had poplar wood cars Wow true fact how cute yeah it was cute I was a cute boy scout I bet you were I was a terrible Girl Scout or Girl Scouts yeah and I sucked at it as my mom was not motivated enough like yeah oh [ __ ] no way it wasn&#x27;t organized enough well that&#x27;s the reason I wanted to join Girl Scouts just wanted to like win there&#x27;s prizes right now I don&#x27;t need to go door-to-door and like feel cool selling stuff yeah and you&#x27;re selling stuff because you&#x27;re raising money so you can do [ __ ] with your troop yeah well I never did anything with my troop because they only last and that [ __ ] about two months me and my mom bailed after the judgement from the other moms damn dude sorry I didn&#x27;t do it that long either but I got a rank or two and I went on a couple I don&#x27;t even know if I ever got like a badge or like it the best no maybe I got at the beginning and we just never used it and threw it out put it in the dress-up clause all the patches watch him frame that [ __ ] he probably would I was way too lazy to join that so I don&#x27;t blame you Josh I gets to you thriving in that environment you know poplar cars but I didn&#x27;t like I was good at it he&#x27;s an overachiever and he wanted to win everything so it&#x27;s perfect for him so a few days after Terry actually saw the glowing UFO object pass over his fields Gwen saw another unexplained flying object she said it looked like headlights but they were a little ways from the craft like it wasn&#x27;t you know it was kind of priam projected out and it literally lit up the whole side of the mountain like it was broad daylight that&#x27;s really exactly like what happened to me we were at this yeah fair play cabin you&#x27;ve got to tell them the story real fast there&#x27;s really interesting Josh might completely missed this yeah yeah and of course the second you guys come out and see it it doesn&#x27;t exist okay yeah so we were in Fairplay which was just a small mountain town in Colorado and us or withdrawn and we were in a little cabin and the daughters her boyfriend by the way sorry yeah anyways it was just us for we&#x27;re in this little cabin it was pretty secluded and very small cabin we were all hanging out or whatever and then we went to bed and John and I were staying up and like this little loft so it didn&#x27;t really have a full like door or wall or anything was just kind of above in his a-frame cabin yeah it was open overlooking the little living room and there was huge windows looking outside and we recover surrounded by Aspen&#x27;s it was really beautiful and in the middle of nowhere I mean no other there was just he walked all the way to the edge of the property it was just for a while yeah so and you guys were in a bedroom so unfortunately didn&#x27;t see it but anyway so I was it was the first night and I was just sleeping there looking out on the you know I was laying on the bed that I was looking out kind of out at the windows I&#x27;m across out of the loft and all of a sudden there was a futon on the loft as well and all sudden it started glowing underneath and it was like this weird light and like like a white light it was like a whitish blue it looked really LED it was very there was no warmth to it at all it was like blue yeah it&#x27;s very bright cool tone but it started off really really faint and then it got stronger and stronger to the point where it wasn&#x27;t just looking like he was under the couch it looked like it was coming from outside because the entire loft the entire living room was lit up completely in this light and at first I thought I was just tripping out I was like what the heck and so I didn&#x27;t really see anything and then I was like John did you see that and he wasn&#x27;t facing that way using no so I was like okay well he flipped over and then another few minutes later it happened to get and I was like okay do you see that cuz like this can&#x27;t happen a second this isn&#x27;t my brain like playing tricks I mean at this point he was like yeah I totally see this and it happened again it was really bright so we&#x27;re like that&#x27;s weird so it kept happening on and off and and then it happened the second night again and we like I told you about it and you guys tried to like sit out there of course it didn&#x27;t happen of course but then the second you left and went back to your bed it started happening what and it was driving me crazy and the things like freaky for us I was like trying to FaceTime even I was like what am i get like I&#x27;m gonna sound insane if I&#x27;m like come back yo I saw it again like I&#x27;m sure to be gone by the time we got out there it was so weird but you know we had all our windows open and so we could hear everything that was you know going on outside and it was silent when this was happening there was no you know I thought it was like was it helicopter cause it looked like it was coming from above a spotlight is like how you describe it with somebody or something shot here helicopter uhyou see it wouldn&#x27;t be this even know it was like this even glow and it would be like really really bright and it would slowly dim down and then it would become pitch black like pitch black which made sense because we were in the middle of nowhere yeah so I was like okay it&#x27;s not my eyes playing tricks on me it&#x27;s not like the Mont I was like maybe it&#x27;s the Internet box or something like the cable box really like no but it was bright lit up like the whole room it was really bizarre and so then I was like because there was a road way far away with our cars coming so I was like oh my gosh was heavy no because the next night we were looking out the window and I kept seeing headlights you know cars to me by and I saw headlights you know shining in and it looked nothing like this so yeah and they were there far right and it kind of freaked me out John I really don&#x27;t wanna be yeah we were like if someone out there like shining in a flashlight that&#x27;s what I thought it was like someone&#x27;s out if I was like I heard no one they were crunching leaves and what happened the second night as well yes I helped you again so when I was like is this a normal thing so I start there was like a little book there you know how some air babies are like Oh leave a message or how your stay was I was reading other people&#x27;s like reviews to see you saying anything like weird light but no no it&#x27;s like we never said anything to the owner you know we should have I know yeah but that was a crazy thing I still don&#x27;t know what it was and I&#x27;m sad that you guys couldn&#x27;t witness it because I know it bothers me I never saw it and I was going like when it was happening the moment I was so like caught up in it that I didn&#x27;t think to take a video and I was like if I take a video what I feel like doesn&#x27;t show up no I wish you would have seen it cuz it&#x27;s so hard to describe but I&#x27;m glad at least John saw it yes he is what&#x27;s your what&#x27;s your best guess of course my like yeah creativeminds liquor was alien yeah I just we were you I mean it was weird that whole thing was weird especially when you hear stuff like UFOs being described as lighting up in higher mountains as if it was daylight it&#x27;s true like maybe it could light up a huge area inside it was like you could have it looked like someone was literally shining a giant it looks like someone was on a ladder up tall it may be 20 30 feet in the air and shining a huge LED spotlight directly in the a-frame cabin you could see everything all over tonight although all the paintings on the wall it was not it like it was a conflict yeah it was multiple ways multiple lights multiple times in a row that&#x27;s weird I mean it could have been a helicopter because nowadays there are helicopters that fly virtually silent virtually you can&#x27;t hear lighting you up every few minutes like that wasn&#x27;t nice oh good see movement of a spotlight like that was the lights the same angle it was it wasn&#x27;t like I would travel II would light up the room yeah it would evenly just and then go back down it was really weird yeah and if you look outside like you know this is on the second level of this cabin &#x27;us the loft in the windows if you think about that angle and you follow that out those windows there&#x27;s literally nothing like that&#x27;s just a mountain range right there so I discovered an aspen view was like we were very secluded yeah maybe they were lighting up the side of the mountain we were right up against our mountain at least winner for my view it always started under the futon on top of the loft so I was like one that do they have a light under the futon I was so confused I don&#x27;t know maybe was haunted I Lily started going there with my mind then I was like nope drop it there I turn over cuddle with my blankie cuddle up my dogs I just shut my eyes it&#x27;s not gonna happen tonight tonight yeah that would freak me out good thing I didn&#x27;t see that I was sleeping like a baby yeah the only thing I could think of as like something was watching us or like maybe there was a drone or something that had some sort of subtly but why was like out there with a flashlight just shining it in oh yeah that would be a problem how would be a problem and why would you shine a light in that night we&#x27;re not clearly gonna wake up see the difference between a light and yeah yeah silence no one was walking around you could easily used where they are well yeah yeah we had a giant deck it was creaky the dock there was really fun she probably was a UFO I mean where it was like led like light blue ish yes that also freaked me on as soon as I was like why is there no natural yeah exactly it&#x27;s not natural a spotlight yeah there&#x27;s definitely UFO activity in that area that we were in so it&#x27;s from it is positive absolutely yeah there is a lot of beautiful activity so it&#x27;s very possible it was one yeah it&#x27;s really crazy though yeah so anyways I don&#x27;t know we&#x27;ll never know yeah I still like think about my mom&#x27;s what if I contact her and told her and she was like oh yeah that&#x27;s just a blah blah whatever like hassle there&#x27;s a watchtower three miles down the road ranger station or something it could be something like that we should honestly like reach out yeah or she&#x27;s like oh yeah I should go back this has been a thing in our house for years like when we used to live here we would deal with this too let&#x27;s go back and host an investigation yeah there we go maybe everywhere we stay we just got to do a paranoia yeah good god yeah that&#x27;s kind of crazy though but anyways so the schurmans had all sorts of crazy [ __ ] happening there having UFO sightings all the time cows were disappearing cows were they were finding cows with literally like holes drilled in their eyeballs yeah and weird chemical smells coming off of them gusting yeah so like what printers gonna drill a hole in an eyeball and yeah the way with it yeah really just really bizarre you know mutilations that were happening to their cattle like pouring out the inside of body parts and like at one point the the eyeball was cored out so so deep that they were able to like stick a wire through into the brain disgusting like you know like I said there are animals and you know things like that that will eat those fleshy areas so it&#x27;s possible they could eat through the eyeball to the brain hate thinking about gonna eat the animal inside out but then again this was like shortly after so like literally the animal dies and then the next day the it&#x27;s already being eaten like what are the chances of that so and it doesn&#x27;t explain the chemical smell but the most spectacular UFO phenomenon they observed was described by Terry said quote we would see these hundred foot circular openings appear in the air it was like for orange colored doorways what a sort of spiral open now this has been a lot of people speculated about what this was and some people believe that this was some type of portals that would open up I mean we&#x27;re talking 100-foot circular openings so yeah it could be some sort of craft but that&#x27;s a vortex situation exactly we&#x27;re talking about a spiraling thing that would open up and yeah in this area like another to another dimension potentially something like that that&#x27;s what people believe people believe that there are these portals in this area that are open to these other dimensions hence why there&#x27;s all this you have you know UFO you know creatures cryptids things like that that may not be from this dimension in this area and you know skinwalkers thinking like that so really bizarre and apparently what they looked through a high-powered scope and they watched as a smaller craft would emerge from the hovering portals so literally they would watch UFOs come out of these portals and fly around the property and then re-enter them and disappear can you imagine seeing that like some crazy [ __ ] like I would love to see something like that I&#x27;m just waiting for a [ __ ] anything we all are why doesn&#x27;t happen that&#x27;s like we heard the post of this podcast we should have something paranormal or you know we should have experienced we should have been happy to the amount of times that our dumb asses have thought we saw UFOs or like think we see something well normally just my dumb ass shut and then Josh tells me nah nah babe something military probably yeah we&#x27;re just like most the time something normal remember the time we were in Jamaica and we saw lanterns like fire lanterns and a wedding and we thought they were UFOs we started you were sending me pictures you were like oh my god I said Joe video those are [ __ ] lanterns dude hey hey we were smoking that Jamaican Kosh not gonna lie [Music] do those lanterns like yeah Mon you&#x27;re the closest we&#x27;ve ever come Aron it was so obvious they&#x27;re like being launched from the beach right in front of our room and we were like oh so much sense like of course a wedding on a beach would have those God but you&#x27;d be surprised at how often lanterns get you know they look people think the way that they move in the sky they hover they&#x27;re glowing they look really crazy but yeah I&#x27;m still waiting till the day where something paranormal actually happens to us that would be amazing well we got to do some more paranormal hunting for this stuff I know but like not even paranormal but like something alien yeah I want I want to see a UFO what else we gotta go to we got to go to the hotspots man we got to go to skinwalker ranch you got to go to these areas where it happens more do you think guys should we start making some mile hair trips documenting some travel to these places I think it could be really interesting I&#x27;m definitely interested cuz I think and that&#x27;s how you do it I mean that&#x27;s how other people do it yeah they go to these areas and you stay there long inner self Adventure is out there right I mean what are the chances of UFOs gonna drop in front of our house or something else we&#x27;re gonna just like come home from the store and there&#x27;s a UFO landed in our drive genell&#x27;s had like three possible paranormal experiences so I think just to to though I don&#x27;t think much yeah they weren&#x27;t that crazy yeah and I think most people have at least one or two like you know unless you&#x27;re like a paranormal investigator you don&#x27;t have like tons and tons of different experience yeah because you got to think about it to thinking about how much paranormal activity probably miss that we don&#x27;t notice that is happening that we just don&#x27;t realize is happening oh yeah it&#x27;s probably more often than not I would imagine one of these things I will arm but one of the interesting things I wanted to mention that kind of connects multiple topics we&#x27;ve talked about Roswell area 51 and now skinwalker ranch is that when you plot out these different locations on a map actually and you draw a line between them it forms of triangle way to triangle exactly is this like the UFO Bermuda Triangle like it&#x27;s interesting that you area 51 groom Lake Roswell and skinwalker ranch and in this area within it all this how all this activity&#x27;s happening that is super interesting I&#x27;ve never heard that before I didn&#x27;t realize they made a triangle like yeah yeah a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that Wow so stuff just happens in that entire area there&#x27;s something significant about the triangle I feel like - or that area that&#x27;s um that maybe there&#x27;s a reason area 51 was right in those locations and maybe there&#x27;s a reason that these aliens crashed at Roswell because they&#x27;re maybe there&#x27;s something different with the energy I don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s something going on or something special about this area because if you think about like the Bermuda Triangle and all of the crazy kind of paranormal [ __ ] that&#x27;s happened out there there it&#x27;s the same type of situation and there&#x27;s all you know why are the pyramids away there are why are they all connected and then you look at across the world and there&#x27;s probably even more triangles that you could form between you know various points of paranormal activity triangle seems to have significance to it mm-hmm it does especially when it comes to energy does pyramids triangles all that it&#x27;s very it&#x27;s very interesting how they&#x27;re all sort of connected and how it&#x27;s kind of connected through the esoteric and Nicole and all of these different really like interesting topics that go back really far in the history and events I don&#x27;t know I find it really interesting yeah connecting those dots but some other strange events that happened during the two years at the ranch with the Sherman&#x27;s like we said earlier the pastures were just all of a sudden light up at night there were sounds of heavy machinery that could be heard like something operating under the earth like we&#x27;re like grinding really like almost ominous sounds coming from beneath the ground um and not only that there is obviously poltergeist types of activities like items would disappear hence why they had locks on all the cabinets and stuff because [ __ ] would just move around put stuff back there just be like constant [ __ ] happening in the house itself they would report hearing disembodied voices I think there is like a female that like there could be potentially spirits haunting this area in this house and this homestead and on skinwalker ranch like it&#x27;s just like a really yeah force something whatever it is that is like feeding this activity but the final straw for the Sherman&#x27;s happened on the evening of May 1996 when Terry was outside with three of his ranch dogs and this was when he noticed a blue orb darting around in the field near the ranch house and he urged the docs to go after he was like go get it which I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s smartest thing to do but the dogs went chased and we&#x27;re like barking at this orb of light and they followed it into like some bushes and that was when he heard three horrific yelps and when he called for the dogs they didn&#x27;t respond and so then I got him well I don&#x27;t know something got him because the next morning when he went back out to look for the dogs he found three round Reesey lumps he just left them out there he was like oh well they&#x27;re probably dead gonna go inside I guess yeah I Jekyll in the morning I guess that Savage and there was like just three lumps of goo on the ground oh my gosh that&#x27;s disgusting like they they say it was like butter a greasy piece of butter yeah that&#x27;s really and the earth was scorched like something had something of like incinerated these dogs like that this is blue Ornish and the blue orb thing is interesting because there&#x27;s actually a lot of different stories have people saying there&#x27;s blue orbs of energy but it kind of looks like liquid inside it&#x27;s very weird looking like we don&#x27;t even really know what it is it could be its own entity it could be some type of energy ball but it seems to have some sort of intelligence and ability to take life clearly if it killed these dogs so I don&#x27;t know what this [ __ ] thing is it&#x27;s crazy though but this was kind of the final like they were like we&#x27;re done like this is crazy we love these dogs we lost or like like anyone would be if you lost your dogs and pets you know you&#x27;ve already lost your cattle you&#x27;re losing money you&#x27;re like yeah enough is enough I need to figure this out we can&#x27;t stay here anymore again only there for two years and they&#x27;re out and so after you know all this happen they kind of are like okay we need to go tell somebody we need to figure out you know we need to get out of here but we also need to warn others cuz there&#x27;s something this place is haunted there&#x27;s something yeah there&#x27;s it&#x27;s not normal here so they went to the media and actually George Knapp a very famous journalist um in this field of paranormal I&#x27;m actually kind of help them get their story out it doesn&#x27;t seem like many people do that anymore like you never hear of nowadays like so-and-so claims they&#x27;re haunted haunted house going on over here haunted this you never see journalists reporting on that but like a bunch of these older stories have they you know they go to the media to tell their story they actually publish it yeah it&#x27;s interesting it&#x27;s like does that stuff not happen anymore do they not go to the media or the media just doesn&#x27;t publish that type I think the media just doesn&#x27;t publish it I think the media is very skeptical and they&#x27;re very worried about being like factual yeah that if it&#x27;s not in like george knapp specifically is known for these types of stories you mean he broke bob lazar he was the one that brought bob lazar story to everybody so he&#x27;s kind of he&#x27;s definitely like a dedicated his career to this kind of works and there&#x27;s just not that many people like him out there that do this too and and are able to bring these paranormal stories to the public but after this kind of got into the newspaper and stuff as they were you know trying to sell the ranch and get out of it they had like some interesting people come to the ranch that identified themselves as like a navy intelligence officer from North Carolina and then they had an agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations that came by and took interest in what was happening there and took a look at the photos that they had and things like that which is interesting that the military is all of a sudden piqued their interest of all this activity there but on their last day at the ranch they were rounding up cattle and by the late evening they were exhausted so they locked their doors and you know saw that their children went to bed and then they went and went to bed themselves and the next morning of their last day at the ranch they awoke to find their bedding covered in blood oh no and they both had 1/8 inch deep scoop marks in the same place on their right oh that&#x27;s so cool what&#x27;s a goof bar yeah so like something had died any little scooper gone in there and took like a piece of their thumbs for testing probably right I mean that&#x27;s what it sounds like right well so they take a little piece of their thumb something is something is there and is actively doing these things to them oh that&#x27;s so great in fact their stories are true yeah can you imagine that and literally they&#x27;re like God I get out it I can only imagine like yeah you know waking up and all this has happened to you like in your home space yeah this is this is it we&#x27;re done so this is when Robert Bigelow billionaire genius playboy Halley yeah no he is a he&#x27;s a playboy like he was a Playboy model yes yes absolutely man back in the day oh yeah honestly he&#x27;s kind of hot for his age and it&#x27;s interesting we don&#x27;t hear all right that&#x27;s fine no I&#x27;m he is very attractive I agree a strong strong jawline there who does he look like don&#x27;t worry snowy see Burt Reynolds Burt Reynolds yakky honey does actually what I find interesting about Robert Bigelow is that we hear all the time about Elon Musk well we don&#x27;t hear about this guy and this guy&#x27;s potentially knows more probably actually does know more especially Boeing never know about him know for how and you know what a mark he&#x27;s made in so many areas - yeah I mean the big thing with Robert Bigelow is his aerospace company that&#x27;s holding expandable space pods he&#x27;s literally building habitats for space right and yet we only hear about SpaceX I feel like and part of that is him like he&#x27;s keeping it very hush-hush and like reason wise he&#x27;s doing top-secret government [ __ ] like he&#x27;s got top-secret clearances with the the government and has contracted with so he knows the government agencies absolutely he knows from [ __ ] nice Shh ah so good no but he he has been studying the paranormal for a very long time and in 1996 he actually went and bought the ranch from the Sherman&#x27;s for two hundred thousand dollars which is less than what the Sherman&#x27;s paid for it they had they they were just like get us out of this somebody buy ranch I think and he was intrigued because he read in the newspapers about all this crazy [ __ ] cattle mutilations UFOs and say like sold he was like definitely want that and he&#x27;s actually bought multiple ranches he owned he knows well he goes out and buys these paranormal hotspots to investigate them and that&#x27;s exactly what he did and I wanted to play this clip from 60 minutes it&#x27;s a rare interview of him talking about UFOs and his interest in them and kind of what he knows about it it&#x27;s definitely worth a listen to understand him better mind blown so crazy I love that clip I want to wish we could interview that 60 minutes interviewer after that be like what do you think of this she was dodging the gears were turning in her mind she&#x27;s like she&#x27;s like they&#x27;re already here yeah yeah [ __ ] he knows some [ __ ] absolutely I&#x27;d imagine if we could get him on the show oh my god yeah he doesn&#x27;t do yeah that&#x27;s like a rare interview he there&#x27;s nothing on him other than that interview and what&#x27;s interesting it&#x27;s been removed from the Internet it&#x27;s had I had to find a reload of the original like 60 minutes does even have it on their YouTube channel it&#x27;s completely died disappeared from the internet it&#x27;s very interesting especially considering now that the government&#x27;s like UFOs are real and he&#x27;s saying there&#x27;s an et presence aliens have been visiting us and pens why he&#x27;s buying skinwalker ranch and after he BA skinwalker ranch he formed a group called the National Institute for discovery science or knids and what they did is they essentially turned the ranch into a paranormal laboratory he was really interested about all the happenings that were going on at the ranch and so he brought in all these experts including Jacques has valet how put off Melvin Morris and Edgar Mitchell which is interesting because how put off is now and to the stars with Tom DeLonge is he yeah so this is these are all people that have been in this subject for a long time doing research yeah really know their [ __ ] about what&#x27;s going on because yeah how put us like a really smart scientist and Edgar Mitchell&#x27;s ex astronaut that was a part of this too and they all were working in at skinwalker ranch so not only they have PhD scientists but they had former if the FBI field investigators and other law enforcement professionals and they and this is when they essentially turn skinwalker ranch into like another area 51 they put gates up they posted keep out signs the ranch was completely fenced they had a observation tower and they even had a veterinarian move in and they also implemented high-tech sensing equipment in a security detail which guarded the property 24 hours a day they literally hired camo dudes like an area for the private ex-military force that guard skinwalker ranch to this day Wow so you can really it&#x27;s even more guarded now you can&#x27;t even go to it then you can&#x27;t go on the property though but you can go to the area around it the property&#x27;s huge right it is a huge property but you can a lot of it is like Indian Reservation but you can go to a lot of there&#x27;s still a lot of hotspots of activity that you can go and visit to this day but while they were there the knids team was there they were collecting evidence interviewing witnesses and searching for explanations for what was happening at the ranch and this is what he&#x27;s really kind of led the charge in in this whole field of all these fringe Sciences out that we don&#x27;t really the unexplainable things we don&#x27;t under you know science can&#x27;t necessarily completely explain yet and yeah he his nits did all that while they were there what&#x27;s interesting though is that they Bigelow controlled the ranch up into 2012 I believe and actually this Pentagon program that had 22 million dollars so the government contracted Bigelow to go and research UFOs at skinwalker ranch and that&#x27;s where this top you know the top secret UFO project that broke in 2017 you know it was like a big deal and kind of started this whole UFO craze in the mainstream media this was about skinwalker ranch they were doing that research at skinwalker ranch okay yeah fascinating and they were spending millions of dollars doing all this research there and unfortunately like we don&#x27;t really know what the findings were there&#x27;s not they&#x27;ve never released anything as far as you know what they found or if they found that there is skinwalkers or there is interdimensional beings or portals or things like that going on but yeah so they were doing that and then eventually the program got shut down in 2012 and they had ended up losing their funding from the Department of Defense and the AAT IP contract was expired and not renewed now this was about the time that the ranch you know he kind of did everything that he could and ran out of funding and then he ended up selling the ranch for apparently 4.5 million that&#x27;s just a rumor in 2016 too adamantium Holdings now it&#x27;s interesting about adamantium Holdings as that&#x27;s named after a fictitious Marvel Comics metal this company that bosque and Walker inch is this company that nobody knows who owns it it&#x27;s apparently only two employees of this adamantium LLC Holdings real estate group that bought skinwalker ranch sketch and what they did though is they once they bought it they said that and this could be a valid reason that people were trespassing all the time and stuff obviously like trying to get on it and see what was going on as people do with anything paranormal but that what they had to do is they had to put up even bigger fences even bigger gates and into this day it&#x27;s still locked down their security detail if you do I read if you do go try to see it and stuff prepare you the police will stop in question you ask you what you&#x27;re doing and things like that it&#x27;s treated it&#x27;s almost like an area that you want out in Utah Wow and a lot of people I feel like don&#x27;t know that part of this or don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s anything to do with UFOs it&#x27;s all tied in man it&#x27;s all tied into this whole UFO phenomenon all the government the the skinwalker ranch really becomes more of a government conspiracy at this point and you know what did they find at the ranch what findings were there and as far as we know the only things that Robert Bigelow has said is basically confirmed like yeah we saw UFOs there like there&#x27;s one plane fine I&#x27;m just going there they ran out of funding - well the guy I the official stories they ran onto funding but he&#x27;s a billionaire yes it was really like how much paranormal stuff going on there why would he sell it I think the government I think the government took it over from him and this adamantium holdings is just like a cover-up for a government group that is continuing to do research here because why else would they beefed up security that makes bigger gates yeah what really trespassers yeah just have that taken care like how many people are really trying to it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s storm skinwalker range well not yet yeah yeah so like you know maybe there that my other theory too is like maybe there&#x27;s some sort of underground military installation there like just like room like motors something underground happening wow that could explain like some of the animals maybe they&#x27;re doing like some hybrid genetic animal you know yeah testing or you know cloning who knows some crazy [ __ ] happening there underground wow that&#x27;s really interesting but I wanted to wrap up with this last thing here and that is there was an individual that was at skinwalker ranch when Robert Bigelow owned it and he&#x27;s a colonel by the name of John B Alexander he performed research at skinwalker ranch and there is this entity that is very interesting it&#x27;s described by big little researchers as quote/unquote a neurological electricity apparently this is a unique entity that is completely black in color and it takes the intangible form of thick smoke and the smoke is described like a disembodied skin of black electrified energy that poses or possesses intellect like it&#x27;s smart or alive or living it&#x27;s a spirit of some sort something that kind of sounds like an lost yeah it&#x27;s exactly it&#x27;s not yeah it&#x27;s exactly it&#x27;s like that which is interesting because it&#x27;s like maybe lost took they probably did a lot of Hollywood stuff you know they do yeah paranormal stories I was gonna say in that black smoke picture is that from lost yeah I was gonna say that definitely looks like it&#x27;s from lost ha that&#x27;s so funny well I was gonna say if not if it&#x27;s just from something else I mean it looks exactly like that yeah people or they believe that this entity this smoke entity could be causing a lot of like the poltergeist activity a lot of the haunting [ __ ] happening on the property among other things and there&#x27;s this interesting little clip from the colonel talking about this entity real quick did we learn anything absolutely I think that what we learned was that the events were certainly real and definitely occurring he weren&#x27;t figments of somebody&#x27;s imagination or folklore plot as for the etiology nope like column we remain mystified Wow so he said confirmed that the things that happen in skinwalker ranch are real actually happened they&#x27;re tangible but they are completely unexplainable they do not know what it is there&#x27;s no scientific how much they can&#x27;t explain it Wow but we&#x27;re talking a really you know decorated military colonel yeah that&#x27;s putting the reputation on the line to say that skinwalker ranch is a legit thing and this UFOs and all this activity is legit yeah what is he gaining from that nothing if anything people are gonna be like oh you&#x27;re crazy dude yeah exactly right well that&#x27;s the thing is like you know why would you put your reputation on the line to make yourself look like a crazy perfectly for what so you can be known as the crazy skinwalker ranch person yeah yeah and especially the Sherman family like why would you make up all that stuff yep happening to you why don&#x27;t you want to stay there at the ranch like it&#x27;s you bought the place yeah obviously like and that&#x27;s a huge move to like make up to a homestead with all that cattle and every yeah but you work on that for a long time it&#x27;s like a project yeah to just leave like obviously something was going on yeah so yeah I mean it comes back to like what do you believe I mean evidence-wise there&#x27;s not a ton of evidence there&#x27;s some blurry photos um will link a site where if you want to go look at all the little photos that they took and things like that um they&#x27;re pretty blurry but again it was you know in the 90s so it wasn&#x27;t the best it&#x27;s hard with 90s cameras you&#x27;re like disposable camera imagine like UFOs flying in the air you know they didn&#x27;t have cameras and things like that that could really catch that kind of activity it&#x27;s funny how we can see never seem to catch stuff nowadays though now that we all this great technology yeah yeah it is what we do we do Canada yeah I mean I&#x27;ve seen more yeah absolutely and I think it&#x27;s I don&#x27;t know I don&#x27;t know what I think about this I mean I think the activity&#x27;s real I think that the UFO hotspot is real do I know what&#x27;s causing all of it absolutely not could it be aliens sure could it be that there&#x27;s these interdimensional portals I mean that&#x27;s [ __ ] crazy thing about there&#x27;s things coming from other dimensions and ours [ __ ] was [ __ ] and you know causing these kinds of events to happen I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s a really interesting one to think about I mean there&#x27;s tons and tons of stories I mean we couldn&#x27;t possibly cover yeah all the skinwalker ring lost a lot of these legends too yeah yeah I mean at the end of the day you can&#x27;t like verify it right stuff cuz I mean there&#x27;s locals in the area like this is of just a hot area it&#x27;s not just like only on the ranch this [ __ ] happens in the neighboring you know towns and areas people all report all kinds of crazy things happening around skinwalker ranch so definitely something I recommend looking into more there&#x27;s a lot of interesting things to it who knows maybe we&#x27;ll do a follow up to this one day maybe well yeah we could drive six hours Aaron I don&#x27;t think you go on it to see you a bug though right plus if everything is like affected around it I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s still you know creepy energy there&#x27;s a pickup in places that you can go apparently I read there&#x27;s another ranch that a lot of people don&#x27;t even know about that is even more remote but it&#x27;s in that general area I think it&#x27;s even closer of a drive to us oh and apparently the activity is just like off the chain like it&#x27;s all way crazier than even skinwalker ranch I guess also I do stuff you should go yeah I got experience as a judge for myself yeah seriously I&#x27;ve got it like see I know I want to do something it&#x27;s hard to see a UFO so bad we gotta go UFO hunting then oh yes I really want to see like something that&#x27;s not making me a UFO how do you go UFO hunting me driving her in the dark like you don&#x27;t drive around no no no no listen I&#x27;ll give you the UFO hunting 101 course right you go to a hotspot you go to a top of a tall area where you can see very far around but what are the chances you&#x27;re gonna see it in the 15 minutes cause you can I go to reported areas where people see a ton out there for a while absolutely cuz like I wanna do a drive-by drive-through UFO like a drive to see Christmas lights she&#x27;s like I just have a drive to go there&#x27;s no any guarantee you&#x27;re gonna see anything you&#x27;re probably not there is no girl in ours and wait well if you&#x27;re in a spot that&#x27;s like prime location like he said way up high where you have a huge view of tons of you know miles and miles your chances go up guy and you&#x27;re there willing to chill there for a chunk of hours then maybe you&#x27;d see something or if you&#x27;re talented enough like dr. Greer that can just some yeah well that&#x27;s what I was saying I I don&#x27;t really want to just go out on my own like if I&#x27;m gonna go out and do this and spend my time I want dr. Greer there guys oh my gosh can you met that would be so cool though one day like if we got to go up hunting with it dr. Greer like he&#x27;d be like no one I&#x27;d want to go out with oh yeah I feel like if anyone&#x27;s gonna help you see that or attract that it&#x27;s gonna be him it&#x27;s true but it&#x27;d still be fun to go out on our own or I&#x27;ll go by myself I guarantee we won&#x27;t see anything knowing our [ __ ] luck hey I know I&#x27;ve had some weird experiences okay you just gotta believe it&#x27;s true though I say we start with that cabin and figure out what the [ __ ] that light what hard cuz that is freaky have any of you guys ever experienced something like that yeah do you have any like theories of what I could be yeah the drive snow crazy I think about it at least once a week still it like randomly pops Matt I&#x27;m like wonder what it was I&#x27;m sure somebody will come up with some crazy we didn&#x27;t think about oh my god wait my chart was my chart my heart was pounding out of my chest when that was happening I was like I wasn&#x27;t being like oh my god you [ __ ] crazy Ben but anyways guys we will go ahead and wrap it up there don&#x27;t forget our merch is launching on the 31st yes yes and you know will be available on November and forevermore it&#x27;s very exciting well it may not be available very long because we do have limited quantities like I said so hold on we got lots more coming yeah lots of collections that will be very close I D --is very cool very exciting stuff but yes hopefully enjoy today&#x27;s episode of the mile higher podcasts skinwalker ranch let us know in the comments if you believe the events at skinwalker ranch for real and actually happened or if you&#x27;re skeptical and think that they just made all the [ __ ] up but it&#x27;s just a normal you know a normal ranch and you know they did this for publicity into you know what gets me is like you know at the end of the day all these professionals and billionaires and you know yeah anyone out there is right that definitely adds credibility why would he spend the time money and resources to go out there and study that [ __ ] if there wasn&#x27;t anything happening so yeah I don&#x27;t know man crazy stuff but thanks again for joining us we will see you guys next time stay safe and stay woke [Music] you</p>
