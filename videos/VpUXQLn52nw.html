            <p>in physics we talk about the Observer uhuh okay on on many levels and okay in quantum physics The Observer is not simply some conscious entity looking at it right I understand if if you want to make a measurement you have to like shine light on it you have to interact with it in some way and what happened over the years over the decades is like the there&#x27;s like a New Age movement that was convinced after hearing this kind of vocabulary started saying oh it&#x27;s our Consciousness that&#x27;s affecting the outcome look at it</p>
