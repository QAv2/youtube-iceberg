            <p>what do you make a Bob Lazar story in terms of possession of aircraft do you believe him I don&#x27;t believe in the Bob Lazar story to be quite honest I mean Jeremy Corbell has done a great job interviewing him and uh has done some you know beautiful uh documentaries um I just don&#x27;t I I don&#x27;t know how to interpret it and um you know and again this some of the people who fraternize with think it&#x27;s all rubbish uh yeah but he maybe he&#x27;s right but I don&#x27;t know I mean the problem is and um this is a little bit different about how I approached the whole area than a lot of others I&#x27;m less interested in going over old paperwork and all these old histories of who said what you know the whole He Said She Said of the history of of UFOs I&#x27;m a scientist I worked on the brain area because it&#x27;s something I can collect data on I can go back to the same individual collect their MRI again and redo it I can hand that MRI to somebody else they can analyze it I can get materials I can analyze them I can get some of these skeletons I won&#x27;t touch any skeletons ever again but I can analyze it and somebody else can reproduce the data yeah I mean that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m good at and so you know I&#x27;m I I I&#x27;m not going to go into the whole I&#x27;m not a historian yeah that&#x27;s true but there&#x27;s a human side to it I want sometimes I think with these because again anomalous rare events some of the data is inextricably connected to humans the observations right um I mean I hope in the future you know that that sensory data will not be polluted by human subjectivity but you know that&#x27;s still that&#x27;s still powerful data even direct observations like if you talk about about pilots and so it&#x27;s an interesting question to me whether barbazar is telling the truth whether he believes he&#x27;s telling the truth too and what also what impacts his story and stories like his have on the willingness of governments to be transparent and so on so you know you have to credit his story for captivating the imagination of people and that getting the conversation going he&#x27;s maintained his story for all these years with little to no change that I&#x27;m aware of so um but there&#x27;s so many other people who are let&#x27;s say experts in that story um their gut you know you accumulate us a set of sort of uh circumstantial evidence where your gut will say that somebody is uh not telling the truth yeah</p>
