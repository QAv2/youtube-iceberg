            <p>hello I&#x27;m Dr Ronald W SATs founder and chair of the international Society of unified science this is part five of my paper theory of unit based time and displacements of units based time material and Cosmic photons sub atoms and atoms on page 70 section F cosmic ray Decay and material atom building one original Rays the original Rays come from the cosmic sector which is the inverse sector in the reciprocal system by means of gigantic Cosmic Galactic explosions commonly observed as gamma R burst the cosmic atoms are ejected above the inverse speed of light that is 1 to three C Sub C which means that they&#x27;re at or below the speed of light here C subm in our usual one dimension of observation the cosmic sector is not localized in space so the distribution of the cosmic rays in the material sector is isotropic as observed all of the cosmic atoms are fully ionized with negative charges the abundance of the various elements is not too different from that of late stage material matter as determined by the number of charges but there is the usual cut off above iron the charges are transferred to to massless chargeless electrons when the original Rays strike the top of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere two primary rays and secondary Rays these mostly consist of C hydrogen C helium and and C protons other subatomic particles are absent because they cannot be accelerated above C except for those charged electrons created in the Collision processes in the atmosphere apparently the cosmic protons Cosmic hydrogen atoms assuming they do not have gravitational charges simply invert their rotations to convert to their material equivalence because one U of cosmic Mass equals one U of material mass and 2 of cosmic Mass equals 2 of material Mass Cosmic atoms above C Krypton fragment to C Krypton or below these then shed material mass that is they gain cos Mass until a reach the Krypton at which point the rotations can invert to form two massless neutrons starting with Cosmic uum with two material gravitational charges and reading down to see Krypton with zero material gravitational charges Table Six above that is in the previous part of this paper gives the normal Decay sequence of course any Cosmic element in between as possible depending on the circumstances also mass energy conservation must be observed in these Transformations so this uh equation here C Krypton goes to two masses neutrons you can see it there weall that three magnetic displacement units in space and by the way these are Level rotations because we&#x27;re dealing with atoms equal one magnetic displacement unit time that is 4 - 3 = 1 see reference one second edition page 187 the massless neutrons then undergo further transformations in our seor three massless Neutron Transformations and here I&#x27;m going to use effective displacements so masses M Neutron plus the massm proton or excuse me minus the massm positron equals an M neutrino massless M Neutron plus a massless electron equals a material neutr and the massless M Neutron plus an M neutrino plus unit Mass equals a proton a material proton the unit momentum of the mass of L Neutron t^2 s^2 in space time dimensions provides the energy t/ s which is converted to mass T cubed over s cubed when the particle comes to rest in gravitationally Bound system we call that the mass Sy M Neutron and the M neutrino have potential mass as they don&#x27;t have actual mass but they do have potential Mass the sum is 0.00 57852 U plus 1. 66574 = 1.7 22 9 26u which is mass of the charge this proton okay so what we&#x27;ve done here is we&#x27;ve shown that the cosmic matter eventually converts to massless material neutrons which then convert eventually into protons now the chargeless proton on section four hydrogen isotope one a chargeless proton created above combines with a material Nutri know to create the first isotope of hydrogen and there you can see the displacements notice that hydrogen isotop one is actually an intermediate particles because the displacements of the two rotational systems are not identical and then finally five hydrogen isotope 2 which is dyum two chargeless protons can combine to form dyum which is dr2 and this is the first R atom of the material periodic table because both rotational systems have the same rotational displacements so we can now simplify the notation to be just two hyen one hyen parentheses one however gravitation is reversed within the time region becoming a force of propulsion so that a direct combination of two protons is rather improbable even if they are uncharged atom building Beyond H1 neutrinos can acquire magnetic charges by interaction with matter or photons I stated above in the section on Isotopes the magnetic charge of the neutrino can induce the gravitational charge in an Associated atom adding one AMU to the total atomic weight if this puts the isotopic weight of the atom outside the zone of stability some of the vibrational mass is converted to rotational Mass thus moving the atom to a higher position in the periodic table this is in a sense somewhat like reverse beta radioactivity so equations 49 give the basic equations here 2z plus G subn which is the gravitational or isotopic charge plus 2 * new uh e M which means it&#x27;s magnetically charged between goes 2z plus TM + 2 and then we have 2 Z Plus GM plus 2 goes to 2 * Z + 1 + G subm and so overall we go from an atom of uh atomic number Z and atomic mass a to an atom with atomic number Z +1 and atomic mass a two and again Misa m is the magnetically charged Nino seven speed and location of adom building in reference to Pages 282 283 lson says adom building in Intergalactic space is slow because of the low density of matter but the amount of time spent in this state is so long that there is sufficient opportunity for the production of a finite quantity of all of the 117 possible elements plus the unstable 118 and proportions determined by the relative probabilities after this initial period existing matter is increasingly concentrated into larger aggregants this speeds up the atom building but meanwhile there are processes and operation in the interior of stars that destroy some of the heavier elements the adom building takes place everywhere because the cosmic rays are everywhere the heavy elements are not created by Supernova the outward moving debris consists mostly of lighter elements so incidentally It&#x27;s Not Dark Matter between galaxies it&#x27;s the nonluminous matter which is Created from the incoming cosmic rays okay number eight abundance of elements and even not atomic numbers as Lon points out reference to page 285 quote evidently a single addition to the atom rotation introduces a degree of asymmetry that decreases stability as the even numbered elements are generally more abundant than the odd number of uh ones for instance the 10 most abundant elements Beyond hydrogen in the Earth&#x27;s crust include seven even numbered elements and only three with odd atomic numbers the zone of isotopic stability is likewise wider in the even numbered than in the odd numbered elements as be expected if they are inherently more stable many of the odd numbered group have only one stable isotope and there are are five within the 117 element range of the terrestrial environment that have no stable element at all in that environment on the other hand no even numbered element other than brillium has less than two stable bpes section g Mass gravitation and inertia the rotational spins of each atom and subatom with mass or the cause of that mass and its inertia no hick bons here the resultant translational motion is an opposition to the space-time progression and this causes the atoms and sub atoms with mass to move inward toward each other outside unit space this is gravitation there are no gravitational waves gravitons or hions see reference 7 for detailed treatment of interplay between gravitation and the SpaceTime progression H matter properties properties of matter depend on the rotational displacements of the atoms and numbers derived from these displacements not from quote wave functions for an isotope like u238 the quantum mechanics theorist has to work with 92 protons 92 electrons and 146 neutrons Each of which has the quote wave function in contrast the reciprocal system theorist works with the rotation of displacements four and four and six plus 54 gravitational charges this represents a vast reduction of complexity and therefore makes possible the abono calculation of all the properties of matter no longer can a theorists say that although he can solve the problem quote in principle he cannot quote in fact act because of mathematical complexity in the author&#x27;s current series of papers such as references 9-18 many properties have been calculated and the resultant equations put into the reciprocal system database which by the way microcosmos modules now available a number of chapters in larsson&#x27;s Works reference two and reference one second edition are sufficiently detailed so that the present author could directly code the properties into the database these chapters include the following basic properties of matter that is uh solid cohesion interatomic distances distances and compounds compressibility heat specific heat patterns temperature relations and thermal expansion and nothing but motion simple compounds complex compounds chain compounds and mo Moon compounds the other chapter is dealing with electric and magnetic phenomena particle physics radioactivity matter States Etc have been translated into the language of mathematical physics in the author&#x27;s papers including this one making easier to code programs in the database five Atomic transformation and Stellar energy generation a Concepts the most important Atomic transformation in the universe is that which generates Stellar energy the reciprocal system system rejects the so-called standard solar model see reference one through reference 10 lison explains the reciprocal system alternative as follows reference 3 page 41 from theoretical considerations we deduce that at some point after the interior of a Contracting cloud of dust and gas as been raised to a high temperature by gravitational energy a relatively rapid rise in the temperature of the entire aggregate occurs when the destru limit of the heaviest element present is reached in the central regions and conversion of Mass to energy begins as explained in volume two both the thermal energy of the matter in the star and its ionization energy are space displacements and when the total of these space displacements reaches equality with one of the rotational time displacements of an atom the opposite displacements neutralize each other and the rotation reverts to the linear base basis in other words both the ionization and a portion of the matter of the atoms are converted into kinetic energy in as much as all atoms are fully ionized before the temperature limit is reached and the heavier atoms are capable of acquiring a greater degree of ionization than the lighter ones the amount of thermal energy required to bring the total space displacement up to the limit is less for the heavier elements the limiting temperature is therefore inversely related to atomic mass and fo translating these Concepts into mathematical physics has not unfortunately proven to be easy reference 60 and reference 61 gave the previous attempts which concluded that the thermal dtive temperatures are on the range of 10 to the 13th to 10 14th Kelvin which is patum ludicrous transforming potential gravitational energy at the rim of a star to kinetic energy at the cor star brings the temperature of a heavy element up to approximately a billion Kelvin the thermal destructive limit can therefore not be much higher than this also the relevant natural temperature unit to use is not the usual time space gas temperature which is 72042 * 10 12 Kelvin but rather the vapor and condensed gas temperature unit 3.59 78 time 10 the 9th Kelvin Stars contain condensed gas not perfect gas C reference 2 page 16 reference 2 page 107 calculation of destructive temperature a magnetic rotational displacement which is two-dimensional n is equivalent to 2 * n^ 2 Electric rotational displacements which are one dimension translating the above Concepts to mathematical physics we obtain the relationship between between these rotation displacements and the destructive thermal limit so 2n^2 = Z which is the atomic number times the quantity 1us T subv sub U / T destructive plus e subi which is the ionization energy divided by two times the conversion factor from a to U and conversion factor U to MV so again uh T subv is an natural temption unit for Vapor condens its gas State he suppies the total ionization energy the element in MV and is the atomic number so solving for T destructive we get equation 50b which you can see right there the value of n is the principal value minus one because the first displacement is ineffective or the secondary value whichever is greater neglecting isi for the moment we can plot uh the destructive temperature is of function of atomic number follows there&#x27;s a MTH CAD program there and there&#x27;s figure one destructive thermal limit versus atomic number what&#x27;s interesting about this graph is that for elements from Z 69 down to Z 66 the destructive limit is lower than that for Z 117 from Z 66 downward and zal 117 downward both curve segments on play so let&#x27;s do an example calculation we&#x27;ll use thorium for this example thorium&#x27;s atomic number is 90 the magnetic rotational displacement is uh four uh isi uh uh theorum is 68836 MV from the reciprocal system database so we calculate the destruc lorum is 5.58 2758 * 10 9 leaving out the ionization energy which is actually kind of small we get the destructive limit it&#x27;s being 5.58 2793 * Cal including ionization lowers the destructive thermal limit by just a little bit gravitational energy at the rim of the star and kinetic energy at the core of the star continuing to form but without isotopic charges let&#x27;s consider what happens as the atom of this element makes its way from the rim of the star to the core and and by the way we&#x27;re observing gravitational segregation here the heaviest elements will sell in the core and the wter elements will be on the surface of the star nothing unusual here by the first law of thermodynamics the gravitational potential energy of this atom at The Rim neglecting the small kinetic energy changes to kinetic energy at the core and these values must be equal there I show the mass of the thorium atom in me and then the mass in kilograms and then we set the uh the kinetic energy into the gravit potential energy equation 51a where the relative the relativistic form for the kinetic energy shs on the left hand side because velocity can be quite high and where the current mass and radius of our Center is on the right hand side for convenience so we&#x27;re taking our um sign this example so solving for the velocity we get uh z206 C the total energy is independent the mass although only the heavier atoms there&#x27;s of iron and above will make it to be Port the star the kinetic energy is 3557 94 muv which is the same order of magnitude as the ionization energy incidentally the energy for ionization does not come from gravitational energy if it did there would be nothing left for the kinetic energy so the ionization energy for the atom under consideration must come from n energy generated when another atom reaches the disruptive limit the atoms immedi vicinity Must ALL become fully ionized if they were not orally and there&#x27;s something else the atom here is not going to be losing energy by radiation because it&#x27;s going to be absorbing and emitting the high energy photons coming from the core so the gravitational potential energy gets completely converted into into kinetic energy which then leads to the temp of the core of the star the temperature of the atom in the core of the star is calculated based on an assume thermal distribution velocities one would use maximal distribution for our perect gas but we&#x27;re dealing with condensed gas or vapor here unfortunately need a conal the the recipal system has a suitable distribution to the state of matter although hypothetically we could throw in a compressibility factor it&#x27;s going to have to be uh worked on later but therefore we will have to use maxell&#x27;s distribution as an approximation depending further theoretical work maxell&#x27;s equation it&#x27;s given here in equation 53a and incidentally there has not always been agreement as to how to apply the Len Factor on the right hand side is reference 62 so now we solve for the temperature T and we get 2.75 233 * 10 9 kin the ratio of this temperature to that of the destructive thermal limit is about 493 so the gravitational energy provides only about half the energy necessary ah but the velocity calculated above is the root means Square velocity some atoms will have a higher velocity and thus they will reach the burning temperature you can calculate the fraction of atoms reaching you higher velocity as follows and you can see there equation 54a and so we get velocity uh the destructive velocity is 9.66 33 a * 10 5th m/s which is 03222 C the fraction and Sub of atoms at this velocity of traveling to the core is and based on reference on page 261 where the average temperature is still T we get this Factor U is 1.91 15167 and that gives fraction as being 0619 to3 so over 6% have this velocity burning commence for those ATS the okay now we&#x27;re on Stellar energy Generation The amount of energy so generated is quite astounding compared with the supposed conventional hydrogen helium process when thorium loses 32 electric rotational displacements it becomes ser I presumably serium is fully ionized upon conversion and so from the reciprocal system database the energy rization sering is 22738 713 MV the accell energy generation is going to be 32 * 2 * the conversion factor from am to times the conversion factor U plus the difference in ionization energies between thorium and serum and we finally ulates uh on no Isotopes here 5.95 9714 * 10 4 me this is the situation where the magnetic I magnetic ionization level is zero that is g equals z for both of the atoms but suppose Atomic conversion takes place in an environment where the magnetic ionization level is one as in our present day solar system so G is not equal to zero the difference in G between two must also be converted to energy in a thorium to surum case we have G thorium 62 and G surum equal 22 so then we calculate that the energy generated is 8.75 through3 * 74 where we&#x27;re using Isotopes here it&#x27;s mid-range and the Magnetic dination one so even though heavy atoms are very rare the amount of energy generated totally compensates section of Stellar reaction rate according to Professor Lang reference 39 page t36 Lumosity of the sun is 2.38 9438 * 10 to 39 me per second his hydrogen to helium calculation yields per reaction 26264 m V therefore the number of reactions per second for the conventional theory is 9114 286 10 37th reactions per second for the reciprocal system using the Thor the serum calculation above as an example or average we have 2.7 29754 * 10 34 reactions per second the ratio of the number of re anoms of thorium to B of hydrogen then needs to be at least 29952 a * 10 the minus 4th heavy elements may be rare but obviously there&#x27;re sufficient number to produce to calculated Stellar energy generation Professor Lang reference 39 page 164 says quote all the heavy elements comprise only .1% but this is more than sufficient the ccal system calculations that&#x27;s given above appli to all main sequence stars and All Stars approaching the main sequence of course substitute the appropriate Stellar Mass radius luminosity and atomic species note the number of neutros generated in the reciprocal system reach reaction for the sun is not necessarily 30 times n reaction per second it could be considerably higher simply due to the huge energy generated the conventional calculation says that there are two electron neutrinos created per reaction nearing a flux of 1 Point 822 857 * 10 to 38 neutrinos per second from the Sun to get the same number from the cical system there would have to be 6,678 matros per reaction keep in mind that the ratio is uh okay so we have that if e Stellar energy Generation divid by E conversion factor Stellar energy equals 3 33886 7121 the number assumed yellow photons cated per second equated energy equated energy to the total energy of the initial gamma and x-ray photons would be new sub 4.1 * 10 14 cycles per second and so that would give us 5.15 68 91 * 10 to 10 photons so a conversion of just a few thousand of these to neutrinos is certainly followable the conclusion of the paper before we get to the pend this paper has applied the reciprocal system to numerous properties of SpaceTime photons have atoms and atoms included are the properties of
