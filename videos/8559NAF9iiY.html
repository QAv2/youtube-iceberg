            <p>[Music] [Laughter] hello everybody&#x27;s gone back with another interesting story this one slipped under my radar in August of 2002 and for those of you that may have missed this one as well dying seeks the help of Russian scientist dr. Eugene but let north into anti-gravity this was a Don die adoption money line on the 5th of August 2002 at 1800 Eastern Time I can only find the transcript of the Steve Young CNN financial correspondent voiceover he passed away in April 2003 after a long battle with lung cancer he was aged 61 - but at its fantomworks in southern california we&#x27;re buying the Sears Applied Technology projects the largest aerospace manufacturer in the world has been looking into hardware that shields against the forces of gravity if anti-gravity works it wouldn&#x27;t take thousands of pounds of fuel to lift the spacecraft the spacecraft will ride much less or nothing and anti-gravity could drive it to the stars the authoritative Giants defense Weekly says buying is seeking the help of this man dr. Eugene but let know of a Russian scientist who claims to have developed low and high power anti-gravity devices giantess says the former phantom x8 confirm buyings interest in the Russian and his anti gravity experiments Nick cook aviation editor for giantess Defence weekly he confirmed that buying believes that the science was valid and that it was really an issue of scaling the science engineering the science to see if it was workable in a statement buying said to quote we are aware of portlet nerves work and will be interested in seeing further development work being done end quote while anti-gravity may sound like science fiction NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center has placed the contract with the Columbus Ohio firm to try replicate the Russians anti-gravity experiments experts say anti-gravity might also be harnessed to create weapon systems that could knock satellites out of the sky as an interesting twist he&#x27;ll put off Institute for Advanced Studies Austin now also working for to the Stars Academy I have to say with all other physicists I&#x27;m certainly skeptical to hear about some change in gravitation because physicists are to modify gravity on the other hand we also have to admit that we don&#x27;t know all there is to know about gravity interesting that he now works for to the Stars Academy young this time on camera some scientists are buying his band to get flat because anti-gravity doesn&#x27;t sound far removed from flying saucers it&#x27;s high public relations risk but potentially infinite commercial gain now for a couple of screenshots from some of the articles are referenced this is a transcript from CNN Lou Dobbs moneyline was aired fourth of August 2002 at 1800 eet and down to the article let&#x27;s right at the bottom you can read that there for yourself this is the Wikipedia article about love dogs and interesting they go on to talk about is the porch and founding of space.com and then the article CNN financial senior correspondent young dies as an article about Eugene Portland north and his discovery of gravity shielding I&#x27;ll include the links to all my source material in the video description below so thank you guys and girls for watching this video I&#x27;d be found an informative and interesting and I do believe it&#x27;s a very important insert that live jobs and Steve Young did excellent reporting and I take my hat off to those guys so thanks for watching I&#x27;ll be back soon with more stories and more anomalies Poppa fauna</p>
