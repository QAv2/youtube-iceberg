            <p>The jogan Experience there was no to my knowledge there hasn&#x27;t been any correlation of that and the the creatures that are described in Soro in New Mexico and in Valen Sol in France so those are three cases that I&#x27;ve been very involved in from the beginning from the from day one um involve creatures that are about you know 3T tall that breathe our air recognize our signals you know communicate with us in funny ways even me mentally I mean the witnesses describe getting images in their minds and so on in all three cases and the uh what&#x27;s interesting is you know people can argue about Trinity all they want like they argue about Roswell but the the case in sakuro and the case in in France in Valen Sol were investigated by governments you know not by uh you know the local UFO group although the local UFO group did a good job in all those cases but they were in sakuro it was first the you know the local police local policeman this saw the craft and the beings and describe what happened they he was terrified but you know when the thing took off uh he thought it was something to do with some new Gadget or some work in the desert or it&#x27;s an area that&#x27;s still in the same state today I&#x27;ve gone back there with Dr H son you know with Paul HCK a few months ago I&#x27;ve gone several several times there and so after the police uh turned out the FBI was in town on another case had no jurisdiction in New Mexico for that particular case it wasn&#x27;t a federal case but they helped preserve the ca the traces you know the FBI way and uh the local police was happy to have them there and and then there was the the state police came in and did an investigation and then people from the base you know uh came in with with experts in uh explosives experts in recovery of uh of weapons and and Rockets and so on because they thought it might be something that had come from um you know from the Trinity range that was out of its way right and had crashed near sakuro in which case they might have responsibility including financial responsibility if something was destroyed or whatever so the this was very serious I have the whole file okay it&#x27;s a big file right nobody&#x27;s looking at it I mean the the investigation in Washington now they are saying we&#x27;re going to look at the cases of the last 12 months well what kind of science is that can can you imagine scientists reading this and this is where they are going to solve the UFO Problem by by looking at vague pictures of lights in the sky for one year you know why don&#x27;t they go back to those records those are federal records okay the case in and all five agencies of the French government so this this guy was a farmer he had field where he was growing plants for to make perfume so this was high level you know expensive crop this wasn&#x27;t just you know alala or something and he he goes there at 5:00 in the morning because uh you know he wants to do some to water the the thing and so on before the sun is is up because it&#x27;s going to be very south of France it&#x27;s going to be very hot you can&#x27;t work in the field during the early afternoon so he wants to be done with that he sees this contraption you know in the middle of the field crushing the you know the plants and so he sneaks in and he&#x27;s paralyzed okay now uh there is an egg-shaped object just like the one you know at Trinity just like they one in sakuro it&#x27;s a size of a a midsize truck there are two creatures in front of it human you know human looking two eyes breathing air they look at him sort of amused and one of them has something on his belt takes out points pointed at him and that&#x27;s when he&#x27;s paralyzed now he&#x27;s not you know as you know I&#x27;m not a doctor but I&#x27;ve gone to doctors about what kind of paralysis is that where you can stand up and watch something you just can&#x27;t move they said well there is a type of paralysis that will just inhibit the motor you know motor nerves where you you but you&#x27;ll still be up and aware you&#x27;re not going to fall down you know in a in a heap and from there he sees them going back inside the thing the thing takes off it takes off like a shut out of a gun and it vanishes in midair okay now he goes to see the jarms this man is fairly wealthy he owns quite a bit of you know several Fields expensive crops his wife is the mayor of the town the jarms are going to be very careful with him because he&#x27;s also from the resistance in World War II when he was young he joined the resistance and the resistance in that part of France fought in the in the Alps against the Germans and you know they were regarded as heroes of World War II uh and so the jarms are very careful with him there are some things he&#x27;s not going to tell the jarms because he thinks and I I went there he didn&#x27;t want to talk to anybody from Paris he didn&#x27;t want to be on TV he he wanted to concentrate on his experience because he thought there was going to be something else and he was aware of some of his buddies now this is a part of France where people talk but they have secrets too I mean historically you know uh there are things like that in the US you know Parts where people are not going to talk to strangers right the only reason I could go there was that I was I I went there with um a lady who was from Paris was from with the government she was with the G&#x27;s government she had a rank of Ambassador and she had a vacation home there so we went there for three days and she knew everybody there and uh he told us what he thought might happen happened again and uh he so he didn&#x27;t want the jeams mixed in with what what he was doing why why did he think that something was going to happen again um they evidently and you know he SWS to secrecy about what it was but evidently there was communication with the beings when when he was there and so these beings just tiny look like people did they have different features than us or was it just they are just like the ones at Trinity and like the ones at Soro so in that book you have actually uh two two and three you have seven creatures that are humanoid that breathe our air that seem to understand us you know the visual uh you know there&#x27;s visual contact um well we can have visual contact with animal I mean that doesn&#x27;t mean they are human or meum but the uh there is messages that come through all of that that the Witnesses are reluctant to talk about in all three cases so in sakuro finally the Air Force went there they threw the Air Force out because the Air Force said well you know that&#x27;s just a a gadget you know and from from the from the base and you that was stupid so they finally sent Dr HCK there and uh the do HCK asked me to organize the the FES that were coming I was at Northwestern at the time you know working working I had done my my PhD already and I was on the staff of the Computing Center and we had a small team trying to help you know free trying to help high neck keep the f together so we we were you know in communication with him the whole time and then I I put the files together and I have a file you know this is the official file so these people were reluctant to talk about what these creatures were communicating with them but did they talk about it at all it was it it was very personal very personal yeah it there there had been a communication that transcended their life there was something else something outside so you could almost call it a sort of a religious feeling but it wasn&#x27;t it it wasn&#x27;t about Divinity or God specifically but it was about you know the other side of life some a bigger meaning for life but that&#x27;s that&#x27;s their interpretation it may not be there may be other things that they are trying to communicate but but it was very profound for that you yes but and they all three cases had similar stories in that regard and in all three cases there are there are traces that were measured there you know there is techn ology of s and in in the case of Soro people came up with all kinds of ideas that maybe it was a balloon you know I mean uh special a special balloon right there were only 12 of them in the world and so on well in in the book people haven&#x27;t noticed it but in in the book I I I was able to solve that problem because I found a transcript of a conversation with with a man who was head of a moto pool at the uh on on the you know Army range in uh at White Sands um and he had given his team some instructions on you know how to make sure that the motor pool was working really well because white sand is so big when when people went home uh they could get lost you know at at why sense and then how are you going to find them I mean there are tracks but there is no paved Road at the time uh how are you going to you know find them so you can launch a helicopter the next day looking for you know a lost car somewhere with a family in it but so he made rules that they had to call periodically to report where they were when they went home you know 50 mil away across the desert so uh so they could find them if there was something wrong with the car he&#x27;s driving home with his family this is after the sakuro thing is done you know they are all interrogating the lon zoraa the cop who was driving that thing and he sees a light over the mountains in the southwest towards Mexico uh but it&#x27;s still you know it&#x27;s still in New Mexico but it&#x27;s it&#x27;s in that direction light that&#x27;s not a star it&#x27;s really bright and the the light gets brighter and brighter and his car dies now he&#x27;s head of a motor pool okay for the base everybody reports to him and they have all the you know all the army cars and the trucks and everything else they have tracks um so uh he looks at that thing uh he tries to call his team the radio doesn&#x27;t work radio should work radio doesn&#x27;t work and the the thing gets very bright and then it recedes it goes It goes away the way it apparently came in we don&#x27;t know if it came in or if it just got bright but okay uh the the car starts he goes home and then the next day he goes to his shop he gets his staff together he says you guys are going to take this car apart I want to see every screw and every piece of it and every level and everything and the seats and so on I want to see all of that on the floor and you&#x27;re going to test it and you&#x27;re going to tell me what&#x27;s changed or if anything how that car stopped in the middle of the desert and they couldn&#x27;t find anything and that report was an official report okay that was never published and it it Nails the whole thing you know that this was not a balloon this was not an hallucination the the the patrolman wasn&#x27;t drunk like they accused him of or making up a story and so on</p>
