            <p>You&#x27;re not getting me that easy. Come on. Lock in. Here we go. Already have that full.</p>
<p>We got to get a flow going first. You can&#x27;t just like that. See? Starting with three. Easy peasy. &gt;&gt; I shouldn&#x27;t have looked at the camera.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Yeah. Don&#x27;t look at the camera. What are you doing? &gt;&gt; You want me to start trying to I&#x27;m hitting hard, too. I&#x27;m giving you an No. It&#x27;s hard for me to grab me.</p>
<p>Wait for me to reach. Wait for me to reach. I ain&#x27;t got to look. OKAY. TOO EASY.</p>
<p>SOUR P. NO, WE&#x27;RE GOING. I want that one. No, you have that one. Well, you can&#x27;t have that one either, but we&#x27;re going to do Nerds Clusters for now.</p>
<p>You have one more option cuz that&#x27;s my third pick. Super speed coming in hot and zesty. Got to break THE CUP. IS YOUR hand okay? You hit that thing full force and you lost your sour patch. &gt;&gt; I couldn&#x27;t go faster.</p>
<p>Pay attention. If you want some sour strips or Kit Kats, I recommend you lock in. &gt;&gt; Are they glutenfree? &gt;&gt; It don&#x27;t matter. Don&#x27;t matter, sweetheart. &gt;&gt; Nope.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll look at the camera. Make it easier for you. What is that timing? &gt;&gt; You start grabbing it. &gt;&gt; I should have went kits. Here we go.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four. One, two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two, three. One, two.</p>
<p>Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. I TOUCHED IT. I touched it.</p>
<p>I touched it. You have that. My finger hit it. I just said impressive.</p>
